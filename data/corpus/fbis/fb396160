"Ministry of Defense Sees Normal Call-Up, Armed Forces Up to 
Strength by 1995"] 
  [Text] In a press conference held yesterday in the Ministry 
of Defense, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian General Staff, stated that this is the third month that 
he has been starting his day at 7 AM by reading the latest 
call-up tabulation. This past autumn the Army discharged at the 
same time those men who had served 18 months and those 24 
months, a situation that could have brought on a disaster in the 
form of a virtually total loss of combat capability, if the 
call-up were unsuccessful. This would hold true for Army large 
units proper and for the other Armed Forces in Russia (MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs], Border Troops, etc.). 
  Therefore, the abovementioned undesirable event was 
prevented 
and the Army manpower stabilized. The Army's average strength 
presently consists of conscripts in the amount of 54 percent, 
while in especially important, elite large units (VDV [Airborne 
Troops], strategic nuclear triad), this figure runs at 70 to 90 
percent. 
  The present call-up plan is 73 percent fulfilled. This, 
however, is not the final tally, since students about to 
graduate from tekhnikums and PTU's [professional and technical 
schools], who were granted the opportunity to undergo 
accelerated instruction for the purpose of earning their 
diploma, will be called up for induction into the service as far 
in the future as April. 
  The poorest situation obtains in the case of manpower of the 
Russian troops stationed in foreign countries. The General Staff 
has virtually ceased sending replacements to Germany and the 
Baltics, whence troop withdrawal is nearing completion, and to 
the Dniester area, where, in the words of Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
"Army Commander Lebed persists in causing us problems." The 
Troop Grouping in the Transcaucasus (Georgia, Armenia) is 
receiving a minimum of replacements, and only volunteers, at 
that, since the Russian General Staff is of the opinion that the 
situation in that area poses no threat. At the same time the 
Ministry of Defense is attempting (also on a volunteer basis) to 
improve the strength of the 201st Division stationed in 
Tajikistan, the spot that is the "hottest" at the present time. 
There is a distinct manpower shortage there (the 201st Division 
consists of slightly more than 5,000 men - P. F.). 
  By and large, on 12 December Russian citizens voted for the 
LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], communists, and for 
other ultra-and simply patriotic candidates, but, when it comes 
to the personal level, they tend to shy away from civil deeds 
associated with sacrifice, continuing in the General Staff's 
opinion to employ on a mass scale any means at their disposal to 
avoid being called up. The Ministry of Defense (working with law 
enforcement agencies) is taking measures to apprehend deserters, 
and, in addition, will do all it can to restrict the legal means 
for obtaining a draft deferment. 
  Also to continue in 1994 is recruitment of professional 
soldiers: contract servicemen. They presently number somewhat in 
excess of 120,000 men in the Army (amounting to 10 percent of 
the total number in the lower grades). In this connection, the 
1993 contract servicemen recruitment plan was fulfilled in 
literally several months. The Ministry of Defense generally did 
not anticipate such a large number of persons desirous of 
serving in the Army for money (the minimum pay for a contract 
private as of 1 January 1994 was 110,000 rubles.) On 18 January 
President Yeltsin signed a ukase calling for the recruitment of 
150,000 additional contract servicemen for 1994. By the 
beginning of 1995, the General Staff hopes to bring the total 
number of professional soldiers, including women and personnel 
in extended service, to 400,000 (to 32 percent of the authorized 
strength). 
  In addition, the Ministry of Defense officially submitted to 
the government a proposal calling for additional cuts of the 
Armed Forces manpower limit to 2 million men to replace the 
2.1-million manpower figure that was planned for 1994. As a 
result, assuming that the call-up will be successful, the 
manpower needs of the Army, MVD, and Border Troops by the end of 
the year will be met in the amount of 90 to 95 percent. In that 
case, all Russian Armed Forces subordinated to the government 
will assume complete combat readiness, standing, if necessary, 
fully ready to deal with possible difficulties and conflicts, 
whether the latter occur on the borders or in nearby countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant-General Gennadiy Ivanov, chief of </F>
the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Directorate for 
Military Organizational Development, by Oleg Falichev under the 
rubric "Interlocutor of the Day"; date and place not given: 
"Military Reform: Assignment for Tomorrow" -- first six 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Calling Card: Gennadiy Dmitriyevich Ivanov 
  Born 15 September 1945 in the city of Zernograd in Rostov 
Oblast. Graduated in 1968 from the Riga Command Engineer School. 
  He served in the Strategic Missile Troops for more than 13 
years. He worked his way up from gun crew member to missile 
regiment commander. He graduated from the F.E. Dzerzhinskiy 
Military Academy Command Faculty. In 1984, after completing 
postgraduate studies by correspondence he submitted his 
dissertation for the degree of Candidate of Military Sciences. 
  From 1985 he worked in the Armed Forces General Staff Center 
of Operational-Strategic Research. 
  After graduating in 1990 from the General Staff Military 
Academy he became Senior Tutor at the Department of Strategy and 
a Senior Lecturer. 
  Since June 1992 he has been Chief of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense Directorate for Military Organizational 
Development and Reforms. He holds the rank of 
Lieutenant-General. 
  [Falichev] Gennadiy Dmitriyevich, the Directorate of 
Military Organizational Development and Reforms which you head 
was one of the first directorates set up in the Russia Ministry 
of Defense, and it was there at the very beginning of the 
elaboration of the Concept of the Russian Armed Forces' 
Organizational Development. Evidently this is why interest in 
the directorate, and in you personally, is so great. 
  [Ivanov] Yes, the Directorate's main task is to develop and 
validate conceptual theses in various spheres of military 
organizational development. The adoption of decisions on the 
practical implementation of these theses is the prerogative of 
the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Defense Collegium, and 
sometimes the supreme organs of state power also. 
  Public interest in us is indeed high. Only I would say that 
the interest is not in the Directorate but in the Armed Forces, 
in the processes taking place in the Army, in army reform. Our 
positions have frequently been explained to journalists. There 
are articles in the newspapers and magazines which have covered 
the progress of the Russian Armed Forces' organizational 
development, the creation of its legislative fundamentals, and 
the results of military cooperation in the framework of the CIS 
-- in other words, the questions which come under our 
directorate's jurisdiction. 
  [Falichev] The Russian Armed Forces will very soon be two 
years old, and evidently it is possible to do some summing up. 
  [Ivanov] The main result of Defense Ministry activity in 
this period is the fact that the Russian Federation right now 
has its own Armed Forces, which are disciplined and capable of 
performing the tasks assigned to them. 
  Now let us recall where it all actually began. 
  Despite the fact that, in line with the President's 1992 
decree, a significant proportion of the troop groupings of the 
former USSR became part of the Russian Armed Forces, they did 
not constitute an integrated military organism. The existing 
troop command and control and material/technical supply systems 
were disrupted; there was virtually no military infrastructure 
on Russia's European territory.... 
  These were the conditions in which our Armed Forces were set 
up and in which the foundations for maintaining Russia's 
military security were laid. 
  The importance and complexity of this problem is shown by, 
for example, the fact that even in the first three months of the 
Russian Armed Forces' existence the concept of their 
organizational development was examined at two sessions of the 
Security Council. 
  The changes in the military-political situation and Russia's 
geostrategic position and the reduction in the size of the Armed 
Forces necessitated the elaboration of new approaches to the 
organization of troops. Today it is no longer expedient to have 
troops all along the border, as was the case before. The 
principle of mobile defense is the cornerstone of the reform of 
force groupings. This principle posits the existence of small 
but sufficiently strong forces that are ready for effective use 
wherever a real threat to Russian security arises. 
  The Ministry of Defense's proposals for the combat strength, 
structure, and size of the Armed Forces and its approaches to 
the location of force groupings were approved by the president 
and formally expressed as the Concept for the Organizational 
Development of the Armed Forces and the corresponding plans and 
programs which are currently being implemented. 
  New force groupings are being set up and the previously 
existing ones strengthened; this applies first and foremost to 
the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts. The number of 
fully staffed, combat-effective combined formations and units 
has been increased through a drastic reduction of the number of 
under-strength combined formations and units. The creation of 
Mobile Forces has begun. The transition to a mixed system of 
recruitment is being implemented. The system of military 
education has been restored, and reform in this sphere has begun. 
  At the same time the Armed Forces are performing a number of 
other tasks. 
  One of the most important is the phased withdrawal of 
Russian 
troops from the territory of other states. In 1993 alone more 
than 100,000 servicemen, more than 5,000 units of armored 
equipment and artillery systems, and around 700 airplanes and 
helicopters were withdrawn. This year the withdrawal of troops 
will be largely completed. Everyone knows that our troops are 
performing peacekeeping functions in accordance with Russia's 
international commitments. The social problems of servicemen 
and their families are being resolved. 
  All this is the result of the very considerable efforts of 
the whole Army. What was formerly elaborated and implemented 
over many years has taken the newly formed Russian Armed Forces 
not quite two full years. 
  [Falichev] Do you think that the charges made by certain 
newspapers that the doctrine appeared too late are just? 
  [Ivanov] Elaboration of the doctrine began from the moment 
the decision to form the Russian Armed Forces was made, that is 
to say from May 1992. An interdepartmental commission was 
formed under the Security Council to create this doctrine, and 
we took the most active part in its work, in conjunction with 
other General Staff and Ministry of Defense structures. All our 
plans were presented to the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of 
Defense Collegium, and the chief of the General Staff, all of 
whom made several amendments and criticisms. I should remark 
that representatives of many state structures, including the 
military, worked on the doctrine. The document that was adopted 
is the fruit of collective efforts. 
  Was the doctrine too long emerging? I wish to explain that 
several of its provisions were reflected in the very first 
presidential edicts on the formation of the Russian Army. 
Subsequently, military questions were frequently examined at 
sessions of the Security Council and the government and in 
organs of the representative power. 
  The main provisions of the Russian Federation's military 
doctrine, adopted in November 1993, above all constitute a 
composite document incorporating military-political, strictly 
military, and military-technical aspects of ensuring the state's 
defense capability. 
  [Falichev] The doctrine treats the possibility of employing 
the Armed Forces within Russian Federation territory to suppress 
armed conflicts. In some sections of the mass media the Armed 
Forces are described as policing forces, no less. Could you 
clarify this? 
  [Ivanov] Yes, the Army, as an attribute of the state, is 
designed above all to defend it from external aggression. But 
in certain circumstances danger to state institutions can come 
from within. Why then should the Army remain on the sidelines 
in such a situation? 
  In developed democratic countries, for example in the United 
States, Germany, Britain, and France, the possibility and 
necessity of employing Armed Forces to safeguard internal 
security are legislatively enshrined. The difference is only in 
the formulas, which take account of the specific features of 
those states. 
  I should stress that, first, the Russian Army is allocated 
only an auxiliary role in the performance of internal functions, 
since the accent in suppressing conflict is mainly on the 
Russian Federation's internal troops and security forces. 
Second, the Army is mainly intended to localize the area of 
conflict. Thus the use of the Armed Forces to safeguard 
internal state security is strictly limited. The question of 
the Army's direct participation in a conflict can only arise in 
the event that the internal troops and security forces in the 
crisis zone are insufficient to defend the interests of the 
state, Russian citizens, and society in that region. 
  [Falichev] Today the process of creating a military doctrine 
is behind us. The main avenues of the organizational 
development of the Armed Forces in the long term have also been 
defined. Does this mean that your directorate will be left with 
no work to do? 
  [Ivanov] I will reveal to you the directorate's "secret" 
work plan for 1994. It envisages: 
  the elaboration of conceptual proposals for bringing 
previously adopted laws into line with the Constitution and the 
fundamental provisions of the Russian Federation's military 
doctrine; 
  the preparation of drafts of essential new laws in the 
sphere 
of defense and of draft normative-legal acts providing for their 
realization; 
  the development of a Concept of Armed Forces Military Law 
Reform; 
  the elaboration of approaches to ensure the realization of 
the Treaty on the Collective Security of CIS Member Countries. 
  Much needs to be done in the organizational development of 
the Armed Forces also. 
  We are taking part in the elaboration of options for the 
structure of the Armed Forces in the period after 1995. I 
stress, options, so that they can be submitted for discussion. 
A whole range of scientific research work is being carried out 
to validate the prospects for the organizational development of 
the Armed Forces. 
  But there is a subtle point here. Each branch of the Armed 
Forces will probably envisage the existence of its structures in 
their former capacity and in the long term. But a narrow 
departmental approach must be avoided. And this is not easily 
done. 
  As for the lack of competence of which we are accused, let 
me 
show you by way of example a selection of the directorate's 
cadres. 
  Of the 45 staff members three are doctors of sciences, 14 
are 
candidates, and 10 have academic titles. People serving in the 
directorate mostly possess a wide experience of working in the 
troops, the General Staff, and the staffs of branches of the 
Armed Forces. I assign to the directorate's "gold fund" the 
consultants and specialists among the civilian personnel and 
people who have served in the forces for more than 30-35 years 
in leading positions of the Ministry of Defense structures. 
  Judge for yourself whether we have knowledge, experience, 
and 
professionalism. 
  [Falichev] Don't you have too many tasks and commitments, 
Gennadiy Dmitriyevich? This way you could become a ministry 
within a ministry, subsuming other structures... 
  [Ivanov] I think that that is an "outsider's" point of view. 
We have already read comments to that effect.... I believe that 
our directorate is only a part of a complex machine whose name 
is the Ministry of Defense. Everything that is created here is 
a common product, and that is all. 
  [Falichev] Gennadiy Dmitriyevich, I cannot help asking you 
about articles which have appeared in recent times. They 
concern the defense minister's inner circle. What do you feel 
about them? 
  [Ivanov] I believe that such publications pursue only one 
goal -- to compromise the country's military policy, the Army, 
and the Defense Ministry leadership. If you analyze the 
articles on this topic, you will easily be convinced that they 
bear a self-serving character and appear at times when important 
events are taking place in the country and in society: the 
referendum, the elections.... Typically the authors of these 
articles always refer to various mythical sources of 
information, trying to hide their own uninformed opinions and 
elementary ignorance in military questions. Let us leave these 
articles to the consciences of the authors, who either do not 
understand or, on the contrary, understand only too well that 
the Army is one of the few state institutions which, in this 
highly difficult period, are guarantors of stability. 
  As for the defense minister's inner circle, you will agree 
with the following: Any leader comes with his own team, relying 
above all on those people he knows well. This is a worldwide 
standard, a generally accepted practice, and there is nothing 
surprising in the fact that there are such people in the 
minister's entourage.

<H5>  Missile Attack Warning System </H5>
  The launch of the first Soviet ballistic missile on 18 
October 1947 turned out to be a complete surprise for the U.S. 
military-political leadership. Two years later, when the first 
nuclear device was created and successfully tested in the USSR, 
we crossed out the Americans' monopoly on these weapons. 
  The United States set about creating nuclear missile attack 
warning systems at an accelerated pace. In the 1960's, it began 
to deploy them on and outside its own territory. The first 
echelon was IMEWS satellites, designed to detect missile 
launches and locate nuclear explosions. The experimental launch 
of the IMEWS-1 satellite took place in 1968, and by 1970 a 
space-based system of six IMEWS-2 satellites in orbits 35-40,000 
km high, two each over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, 
was already deployed. This system today monitors the entire 
surface of our planet, ensures detection of any missile launch, 
determines launch time, coordinates, and flight direction, and 
passes the information to command posts in no more than 3-5 
minutes. 
  The second echelon--based on the BMEWS over-the-horizon 
radar--was created between 1960 and 1963 to cover the main 
directions of a likely missile attack--northeastern, northern, 
and northwestern (from the territory of the Soviet Union). This 
system includes three sites, modernized in recent years, 
deployed at Foilingdales-Mure (Great Britain), Thule 
(Greenland), and Clear (Alaska). This system uses a 
multifunctional PAR radar from the Safeguard ABM system. 
  The increase in the number of our nuclear-powered submarines 
equipped with ballistic missiles forces the United States to 
create and deploy in the 1980's new powerful over-the-horizon 
Pave Paws radars on the east and west coasts and also on its 
southern borders. 
  Operational command and control of the nuclear missile 
attack 
warning system is exercised by the NORAD command post located in 
Cheyenne Mountain at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Higher national 
command and control facilities of the United States and its 
armed forces are notified from this same command post. 
  In our country, development and creation of over-the-horizon 
radars for missile attack warning and monitoring outer space 
were done at the Scientific Research Radiotechnical Institute of 
the USSR under the direction of Academician A.L. Minets (chief 
designer Yu.V. Polyak[.sup][/]). The first "Dniester" radars 
were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia. Together they formed a 
solid radar barrier 5,000 km long that ensured accurate 
detection and tracking of space objects. 
  Simultaneously, in 1961 this same institute began developing 
the modernized "Dniester-M" over-the-horizon search radar and a 
missile attack warning system lead complex on the main northern 
avenue of likely missile attack (from U.S. territory) with 
location of these radars in the Arctic and Latvia, and a command 
post in the vicinity of Moscow. 
  Work on these centers and command posts began in 1963-1964. 
The Chief of the directorate, Lieutenant-General M.M. 
Kolomiyets, directly subordinate to the Chief of the Fourth Main 
Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Colonel-General of 
Aviation G.F. Baydukov, was charged with organizing military 
units for them. 
  It is noteworthy that in the summer of 1967, General of the 
Army S.L. Sokolov[.sup]2[/], recently appointed Deputy 
Minister of Defense, deemed it necessary, together with G.F. 
Baydukov and me, to visit the centers in Latvia and the Arctic 
that were in the stage of installation and adjustment of the 
production equipment. Paying no attention to the fact that they 
did not "polish up" things at the centers prior to his arrival, 
he thoroughly, calmly, and with splendid competence looked into 
the state of affairs, learned what was needed, and promised to 
help. And he carried out the promise. 
  In late 1968, a commission chaired by the First Deputy Chief 
of the Main Staff of Air Defense, Colonel-General V.V. 
Druzhinin, conducted state testing of the "Dniester-M" radar at 
the center in the Arctic. In the Far North, the radars operated 
in an extremely complex interference environment, caused by the 
constant chaotic disturbance of the ionosphere, resulting in 
brief blips coinciding in nature to trajectory segments of 
ballistic missiles. This did not preclude the generation and 
issuance of false warning information. 
  In 1970, A.L. Mints said concerning my fears: "Yuriy 
Vsevolodovich, your concern is not without foundation. But 
remember: the leading designers of our institute and I will 
always be with the troops. We will do all that is necessary to 
guarantee that false warning information about a missile attack 
will not be issued." 
  Indeed, the combat programs were constantly worked on as 
statistics were collected. Chief designers Yu.V. Polyak and V.M. 
Ivantsov[.sup]3[/] systematically worked at the centers, and 
other specialist were always there. There were not cases of 
false warning information being issued in the northern and 
northwestern avenues of likely missile attack. 
  Already in 1976, I had occasion to test the lead complex at 
full strength: The radar centers in the Arctic and Latvia, and 
the command post near Moscow, which became the command post for 
the missile attack warning system. Later it was possible to 
technically connect the A-35 early-warning ABM system 
(subsequently removed from service and dismantled), Dunay-3, and 
Dunay-3U to the missile attack warning system command post and 
to finish combat programs, ensuring a mutual exchange of 
information about ballistic missiles and space objects. 
  However, this was not easy. Over-the-horizon warning systems 
(A.L. Mints) and early-warning equipment of the ABM system (G.V. 
Kisunko) were created independently of one another. This 
resulted in the equipment operating in a different system of 
coordinates determining the parameters of a ballistic missile's 
trajectory. Various computers were also used. Mints used the 
5E-73 computer of chief designer M.A. Kartsev[.sup]4[/], and 
Kisunko used the computer of chief designer V.S. Burtsev. The 
automated data transmission systems were also different. Such a 
lack of coordination required a significant working up of combat 
algorithms and computer programs at the ABM and missile attack 
warning system command posts, which took up about 30 percent of 
their memory and speed. Later on, it was precisely these 
circumstances that made it necessary to increase the number of 
computers and replace them with new-generation computers. The 
result was considerable additional expenditures. 
  The various forms of self-spontaneity by the Ministry of the 
Radio Industry and the lack of requirements for standardization 
of arms have been unjustifiably costly for both the troops and 
taxpayers and have impeded the commissioning of new 
installations. 
  This disconnection was overcome to a considerable extent in 
the early 1970's. V.G. Repin[.sup]5[/] was appointed Chief 
Designer of the Missile Attack Warning System. A draft project 
of an integrated missile attack warning system was developed and 
approved in 1972 under Repin's direction. It coordinated and 
distributed the requirements for characteristics of 
above-the-horizon, over-the-horizon, and space-based warning 
equipment and defined the principles of combining and mutual 
monitoring of their data and rules for generating and presenting 
output data. Later, all the work for creating the system was 
done in accordance with this project. Clarifications were made 
in the process of developing new proposals for detection assets. 
  The first stage was the above-mentioned interfacing of radar 
warning center and the A-35 ABM system at a single command post, 
accomplished in 1973. The second stage was the creation of an 
updated command post and the first section of the warning system 
in 1976. The principles developed in the integrated system 
project were confirmed during the course of this work, and 
experience acquired in creating and commissioning super-complex 
information systems. The collective of chief designer V.G. 
Repin, his deputies, and closest assistants, doctors of 
technical sciences A.V. Menshikov, B.A. Golovkin, and V.P. 
Traubenberg, were the first, and long before the Americans, to 
solve the most complex tasks of complete automation of 
obtaining, processing, and consolidating data from various means 
of ballistic missile detection, generating and presenting 
warning information. At the same time, it was also possible to 
manage the problem of high-speed and high-reliability 
transmission of data about ballistic missiles and space objects 
with the aid of systems created under the direction of chief 
designers F.M. Lipsman, V.I. Shvartsman, and I.M. Mizin. B.A. 
Poluektov, a senior headquarters officer, participated directly 
in this work. 
  It must be noted that despite certain complexities in 
relations with the chief designers of individual warning 
equipment, A.I. Savin[.sup]6[/], F.A. 
Kuzminskiy[.sup]7[/], Yu.V. Polyak, and V.M. Ivantsov, the 
chief designer of the system, V.G. Repin, was able to define 
fairly clearly the requirements for the equipment and to 
achieve, basically, their fulfillment. In those instances when 
the basic parameters of the new equipment did not correspond to 
the desired parameters, they managed to bring the system 
characteristics to the required level through skillful use of 
reserves and a systematic approach. 
  Special note should be made of the role of officers of the 
combat algorithms and programs departments and battle task 
allotment officials, many of whose proposals were adopted by the 
chief designers of the system and equipment and helped to 
improve their quality. 
  Between 1968 and 1972, a project of a solid continuous 
above-the-horizon detection field on the western, southwestern, 
and southern avenues of likely missile attack was being 
developed. New centers were created in the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, 
and Siberia based on the Dnieper radar. At that time A.L. Mints 
and V.M. Ivantsov were working on a fundamentally new "Daryal" 
above-the-horizon phased-array radar. An reduced model of the 
receiver portion of this radar was successfully tested at the 
center in the Arctic. 
  In 1984-1985, centers with the "Daryal" radar began to be 
put 
on alert duty in the North and in Azerbaijan, 5-6 years later 
than the originally established timeframe. This occurred due to 
the costs of construction organizations, interruptions in 
deliveries of equipment by plants, and primarily due to the lack 
of readiness of algorithm software. Despite the repeated demands 
of the commander in chief of the National Air Defense Forces, 
the Main Contracting Directorate, and me, a computer base was 
not created in the design bureaus and Scientific Research 
Institute of the Ministry of the Radio Industry. This resulted 
in the fact that algorithm software with the use of authorized 
computers had to be delayed 3-4 years. 
  I would go against the truth if I did not tell about how the 
above-the-horizon radar center was created on the northeastern 
avenue of likely missile attack. It was supposed to ring the 
outer border of the USSR with a continuous radar field. 
According to our prognosis, it was near the U.S. west coast that 
American nuclear-powered submarines with Trident and then 
Trident-2 missiles, capable of reaching the entire territory of 
the Soviet Union, were to be based precisely on this axis, which 
was also later confirmed. 
  According to studies and modeling of the Scientific Research 
Department of the Institute of the National Air Defense Troops, 
under the direction of Major-General of Aviation Ye.S. 
Sirotinin, doctor of technical sciences and professor, such a 
center could be placed in the vicinity of Norilsk or Yakutsk. 
Due to a shortage of electrical power, Yakutsk was no longer a 
choice. The management of the Norilsk Ore-Dressing Plant 
guaranteed assistance in creating the center. However, expenses 
increased since delivery of construction materials and equipment 
was by sea. 
  The question of the location of the center was discussed 
several times with Chief of the General Staff N.V. Ogarkov. I 
knew Nikolay Vasilyevich [Ogarkov] well as a man of high 
culture, reasonable, and able to delve deeply into the essence 
of a problem and make the correct decision. Therefore, I was 
astonished when, supported by Deputy Minister of Defense for 
Construction Colonel-General of Engineers N.F. Shestopalov, he 
did not agree with the Norilsk variant, but demanded that the 
new center be created only in the vicinity of Yeniseysk. This 
point was mentioned in the project of the Ministry of the Radio 
Industry, but was immediately rejected by us due to the fact 
that it was a flagrant violation of provisions the 1972 ABM 
Treaty with the United States on limiting ABM systems, according 
to which over-the-horizon missile attack warning system 
equipment could be deployed in the immediate proximity of the 
state border with the antenna turned outward. Yeniseysk was 
located deep within the country approximately 3,000 km from our 
maritime border. 
  Unfortunately, associates of the General Staff prevailed, 
arguing that this installation could be considered not to be a 
warning center but a means of satellite detection. Despite all 
our objections, at the next large meeting, D.F. Ustinov stated 
for all to hear that if someone in air defense still dared to 
object to Yeniseysk, he would be relieved of duty. 
  The Americans focused their space reconnaissance assets on 
the progress of work on the center on a literally daily basis. 
When its basic structures became visible, they lodged a protest, 
which our government ultimately accepted. 
  The lesson taught us by the American side proved to be quite 
costly, and not only in the material respect. It is natural that 
is also affected the country's defensive capability. 
  Today, some of the structures already erected are being 
dismantled and being made into a furniture factory. We will be 
satisfied if only it begins to produce a product. But there was 
not and is not any above-the-horizon detection assets on the 
northeastern axis. 
  On the other avenues of likely missile attack, Dnieper 
radars 
have been operating continuously for more than 20 years now; 
they are obsolete. In the mid-1980's, construction of new 
Daryal-U and Volga radars began at the same sites at centers in 
Latvia, Belorussia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Siberia. 
  By 1992, more than 50 percent of the allotted appropriations 
were acquired. Now, financing of the installations located in 
the `near abroad' was stopped, and work was suspended. In these 
republics, particularly in Ukraine, steps are being taken to 
privatize missile attack warning installations. 
  The obsolete Dnieper radars will be able to operate for 
another 2-3 years, 5 years at most, and then the entire 
Commonwealth will be left without some of the most accurate 
means for detecting attacking missiles on their flight 
trajectories with identification of the launch area and the 
place and time until the missiles fall. 
  In 1972, when the Missile Attack Warning System project 
proposed by V.G. Repin was being implemented, it became obvious 
that its high reliability could be achieved only by employing a 
complex of equipment using different physical principles. They 
include over-the-horizon radar and spacecraft capable of 
detecting missile launches and issuing information 2-3 minutes 
after their launch. 
  In 1970, favorable results were obtained from an 
experimental 
model of the Duga-2 over-the-horizon radar in the Ukraine when 
detecting launches of domestic missiles from areas of the Far 
East and the water areas of the Pacific Ocean over the test 
range on Novaya Zemlya. This circumstance enabled the Ministry 
of the Radio Industry to submit the project to the Scientific 
Research Institute for Long-Range Communications (NIIDAR) for 
creating two centers in the Ukraine and the Far East (chief 
designer F.A. Kuzminskiy). The project asserted that these 
centers were able to detect the launch of intercontinental 
ballistic missiles from bases on U.S. territory. The decision 
was made and the centers created, but a miscalculation was made, 
leading further work to an impasse. 
  As chairman of the commission examining the project and 
supporting the creation of the centers, it is my fault that the 
effectiveness of the over-the-horizon was assessed based on 
results obtained from an experimental model of the radar 
detecting missiles in conditions of a middle-latitude path and 
relatively calm ionosphere. In conditions of northern-latitude 
paths, in the presence of the polar cap and the constant chaotic 
ionospheric disturbance, the probability of detecting the launch 
of single and small groups of missiles at these centers turned 
out to be quite low. And a massive missile launch from U.S. 
territory is reliably detected only in favorable ionospheric 
conditions. An important condition of an objective assessment of 
the effectiveness of these centers was the use of a mathematical 
model developed at the SNII [Special Scientific Research 
Institute] under the direction of Major-General of Aviation A.S. 
Sharakshane[.sup]8[/], doctor of technical sciences. This 
very complex model contained ionospheric parameters in which 
comprehensively took into account the 11-year cycle of solar 
activity during various times of the year and day. 
  Despite the long and expensive process of tests and 
modifications, the centers were not accepted into service. The 
facility in the Ukraine essentially was returned to industry, 
and the Polar Program of modifying equipment and programs 
designed to improve substantially the detection characteristics 
was carried out there. Due to a plot at the Ministry of the 
Radio Industry, F.A. Kuzminskiy was removed at the most critical 
moment. The program was carried out under the direction of the 
new chief designer, F.F. Yevstratov[.sup]9[/]. 
  During the course of carrying out this program and 
introducing a number of modifications, the NIIDAR collective 
under the direction of F.F. Yevstratov and G.A. Lidleyn achieved 
stable detection by the center in the Ukraine of launches of the 
U.S. Shuttle at a distance of 9,000 km. 
  The Shuttle catastrophe on 28 January 1986 was observed in 
real time as a bright flash on the display screens and a 
stoppage of tracking the trajectory at the moment of the 
explosion and when the rocket engines stopped operating. I 
immediately reported the results of the work to 
Commander-in-Chief of the National Air Defense Troops A.I. 
Koldunov and USSR Minister of Defense D.F. Ustinov, which 
confirmed the report from the United States. 
  The thrust of the Shuttle's engines considerably exceeds 
that 
of the engines of Minuteman ballistic missiles, which leads to 
an increase in the size of the ionized trail and, consequently, 
the size of the radar cross-section of the missile being 
launched. After examining these results, the commission agreed 
with the calculations on the mathematical models of the 
over-the-horizon radar centers for detecting group and massive 
launches of ballistic missiles from U.S. territory. 
  Work on the center continued right up until the catastrophe 
at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The center ended up in the 
sequestered area and was mothballed. 
  Somewhat earlier, in 1978, the CINC of the Air Defense 
Troops 
P.F. Batitskiy made the start of joint testing of the center in 
the Far East conditional on the requirement of real and reliable 
detection of Minuteman ballistic missile launches from the U.S. 
Western Range at Vandenberg to the range on Kwajalein Island in 
the Pacific Ocean. 
  After repeated postponement of the launch of a Minuteman 
missile for technical reasons, automatic detection took place on 
24 February 1980, and the commission under my direction, making 
a detailed inspection of the results obtained, began its work. 
However, further tests showed that the center was able to 
reliably detect ballistic missile launches from U.S. territory 
only under favorable geophysical conditions. 
  After considerable modifications, the center in the Far East 
was placed on alert duty on 30 June 1982. It was periodically 
used to detect missile launches from the U.S. Western Range at 
Vandenberg. Now this center has also been taken off alert duty. 
  At that time, many believed that the path I covered together 
with the designers of over-the-horizon radars was both 
unexplored and fallacious with respect to northern-latitude 
paths. This should be recognized. However, one must not ignore 
the fact that when the centers were in operation, all nine 
missile bases located on U.S. territory constantly felt their 
effect. In other words, they were under the "cap" of our 
electromagnetic radiation. Unfortunately, the dream of F.A. 
Kuzminskiy, who said "We will handcuff American imperialism," 
did not fully come true. Further work showed that the 
over-the-horizon radar in conditions of middle-latitude paths 
and calmer ionosphere is undoubtedly an effective means of 
long-range detection of missile launches, aircraft, and surface 
ships at distances of approximately 3,000 km. 
  Development of a space-based system was more successful, 
although not without difficulties, the general designer of which 
was A.I. Savin. Violation of the established time periods was 
determined primarily by working out algorithm software and the 
low reliability of the first spacecraft (chief designer V.M. 
Kovtunenko)[.sup]10[/]. 
  The system was placed on alert duty at reduced strength in 
1978 and at full strength in 1982; however, its combat 
capabilities left much to be desired both in performance and 
operating characteristics. For example, based on information 
received from aboard the spacecraft, the command post of this 
system made a false conclusion about a massive missile launch 
from U.S. territory. It is not hard to imagine what kind of 
decision the leadership of the country and the armed forces 
could have faced. The cause was an unfinished combat program for 
conditions of heightened solar activity. Fortunately, at that 
time a true professional was fulfilling duties of the operations 
duty officer at the system command post, Lieutenant Colonel 
Engineer S.Ye. Petrov[.sup]11[/], deputy chief of the office 
of combat algorithms and programs. Instantly analyzing and 
evaluating the environment and situation, he did not permit 
false information to be issue to the command post of the missile 
attack warning system. By order of the Minister of Defense, a 
commission chaired by the First Deputy Chief of the General 
Staff, Colonel-General V.I. Varennikov, was appointed for this 
emergency. A.I. Savin and I were his deputies. 
  I had occasion to meet fairly often with Valentin Ivanovich 
[Varennikov] on duty matters. In my view, he is intelligent, 
well-educated, firm-willed, courageous, and good-natured. He is 
a man of duty, honor, and conscience. He conducted the 
investigation objectively and competently. 
  Commander-in-Chief of the Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov 
and I had occasion to be present during his report to D.F. 
Ustinov on the results received by the commission. Judging from 
the atmosphere of the meeting, the relations of the minister of 
defense with the leadership of the General Staff were strained. 
But despite this, Dmitriy Fedorovich [Ustinov] accepted 
Varennikov's report without questions, remarks, or 
organizational conclusions. Most likely, D.F. Ustinov knew 
general designers A.I. Savin and V.M. Kortunenko well and 
treated them with respect and trust. 
  A.I. Savin, unquestionably a talented scientist and 
designer, 
together with the collective from the Kometa Central Scientific 
Research Institute undertook the task of detecting the launch of 
ballistic missiles from the territory of continents and ocean 
and sea water areas. The complexity consisted of the fact that 
spacecraft from orbits 35-40,000 km in altitude were to be 
detected with a high degree of reliability 2-3 minutes after 
their launch, and the information was to be passed to the space 
system command post. 
  It is not worth talking about how complicated it is to 
identify missile launches at night from U.S. territory, 
literally illuminated by powerful light sources. On a daily 
basis the spacecraft observed literally thousands of aircraft 
takeoffs on afterburner. The electromagnetic disturbances in 
space as a result of unpredicted solar flares and also during 
the spacecraft's crossing of the so-called "terminator," when it 
leaves the space illuminated by the sun and goes into the 
earth's shadow, were still not fully known. 
  Checking out the system by the method of experiments 
developed for the most critical situations in order to reveal 
and eliminate flaws in the spacecraft's detection equipment, 
onboard computer programs, in the equipment complex, and 
especially in the command post combat program. 
  All work was analyzed in detail by A.I. Savin directly at 
the 
command post. I was struck by his self-control, intelligence, 
and ability to analyze his own miscalculations principally and 
critically. Incidentally, this was instructive for certain other 
general and chief designers, who during failures tried without 
basis to shift the blame on whomever, including the combat crew, 
considering themselves to be without guilt. 
  We military people were impressed by the fact that A.I. 
Savin 
always first listened to the opinions of combat crew officials, 
specialists of the SNII of the National Air Defense Troops, and 
then his deputies and immediate assistants--K.A. Vlasko-Vlasov, 
V.G. Khlibko, and Ts.G. Litovchenko. He consulted M.I. Nenashev 
and me. He thoughtfully worked out proposals and made 
modifications, which were repeated checked. 
  V.M. Kovtunenko preferred to examine the circumstances 
associated with the failure of the spacecraft in his own office 
at the Scientific Production Association imeni S.A. Lavochkin, 
since there was a mockup of the spacecraft there on which the 
situation that arose during the failure could be reproduced, and 
then repeatedly check the effectiveness of the modifications. It 
was not easy for Kovtunenko to work; he had to conduct a fierce 
debate with managers and designers of many design bureaus and 
plants manufacturing component parts for the spacecraft. Each of 
them believed someone other than their own firm was at fault for 
the failure of the spacecraft. Moreover, it was necessary to 
consider: the rigid requirements of the general designer of the 
system, A.I. Savin, who was always supported by the 
military--the chief of the contracting directorate M.I. 
Nenashev, SNII specialists, and representatives of the Main 
Space Systems Directorate. The question of a claim always arose; 
those at fault were to pay the Ministry of Defense approximately 
three million rubles for the spacecraft failure. 
  I will note that for the general designers and for me, too, 
the unsuccessful launch or premature failure of a spacecraft was 
not only a tragedy but also useful experience. With an negative 
result after a thorough analysis, an opportunity appeared to 
determine the causes and take steps to increase the reliability 
significantly. 
  The CINC of the National Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov 
reacted differently toward this. He had to sign the reports to 
the Minister of Defense, and they were naturally impartial. Many 
times he rudely rebuked both me and, less often, A.I. Savin. 
  By the mid-1980's, through the efforts of A.I. Savin and the 
collective of the Kometa Central Scientific Research Institute, 
V.M. Kovtunenko, and his closest assistants A.G. Chesnokov and 
A.L. Rodin, the space-based system was brought to the required 
level of specifications and became the most reliable and 
effective basis in the integrated missile attack warning system. 
This is of special importance in connection with the serious 
decrease in the combat capabilities of above-the-horizon radar 
equipment for detection of ballistic missiles on their flight 
trajectories, now located in CIS countries on several avenues of 
likely missile attack. 
  A most important element in the integrated Missile Attack 
Warning System is the several territorially separated, 
synchronously operating command posts. In the fully automatic 
mode, the command posts receive extensive information about the 
technical condition of the entire system, and warning 
information is also sent automatically to the command and 
control facilities of the Supreme High Command being warned and 
to the command authorities of the armed services on a special 
"Krokus" warning panel. I remember the three of us--chief 
designer of the Missile Attack Warning System V.G. Repin, 
Colonel-General V.K. Strelnikov[.sup]12[/], commander of a 
separate special-purpose army, and I--depicted on a sheet of 
paper a sketch of the front panel, in our opinion, of the 
"Krokus" for special briefcases of the top leadership of the 
country and the armed forces which contained warning information. 
  Undoubtedly, I should talk separately about such a brilliant 
personality as V.K. Strelnikov. In 1967, upon graduating from 
the Military Academy of the General Staff of the USSR Armed 
Forces imeni K.Ye. Voroshilov, he was appointed Commander of a 
Missile Attack Warning Division being organized for the first 
time. He commanded it for 10 years. His name is associated with 
the development of the large unit and the purposeful education 
of military collectives aimed at unconditional accomplishment of 
a combat mission of national importance. 
  He set the tone in mastering new combat equipment. 
  He was the first among line commanders to become a candidate 
of military sciences. And quite deservedly, he was the first 
commander of a separate missile attack warning army. 
  The task of reliability and survivability of the system and 
its equipment was successfully accomplished. Each facility has 
triple redundancy of the production equipment and special 
technical equipment, and also several separated power supply 
feeds. Self-contained power sources were also created based on 
magneto-gas-dynamic generators. Landline and cable 
communications also have several lead-ins. The facilities are 
equipped with satellite, radio, and facsimile communications. 
  The following made an invaluable contribution to the 
creation, development, and improvement of the operation of the 
system: M.M. Kolomiyets, V.V. Rozhkov[.sup]13[/], V.K. 
Strelnikov, I.A. Slukhay[.sup]14[/], V. M. 
Smirnov[.sup]15[/], A.V. Sokolov[.sup]16[/], V.P. 
Panchenko[.sup]17[/], N.V. Kislyakov[.sup]18[/], A.B. 
Novitskas[.sup]19[/], N.I. Rodionov, V.I. 
Motornyy[.sup]20[/], G.A. Vylegzhanin[.sup]21[/], A.K. 
Mikhaylov, N.G. Zavaliy[.sup]22[/], A.P. Blinov, V.M. 
Shumilin, and many others. 
  In the creation and particularly in the testing and 
operation 
of the ABM and missile attack warning systems, one should make 
note of the collective of the SNII created in the 1960's, which 
I have already mentioned. At that time it was headed by I.M. 
Penchukov[.sup]23[/] and his deputy for scientific work, N.P. 
Buslenko[.sup]24[/]. In subsequent years, the institute was 
led by Yu.G. Yerokhin[.sup]25[/] and today by G.S. 
Batyr[.sup]26[/]. The deputy for scientific research work is 
M.D. Kislik[.sup]27[/]. This institute was the scientific 
headquarters when commissions headed by me examined a number of 
preliminary projects. Favorable conditions were created for 
carrying out the tasks entrusted to the commissions. I talk 
about this with great satisfaction--after all, I was associated 
with this remarkable collective for many years. 
  More than 20 doctors and about 100 candidates of sciences 
labored productively at the SNII. The institute's leading 
scientists were: for the ABM system--G.I. Butko[.sup]28[/]; 
for the Missile Attack Warning System--G.V. Kononenko, B.S.

The institute was the first in the Ministry of Defense to 
successfully solve the problem of evaluating the combat 
effectiveness of complex, essentially unique, and completely 
automated complexes and weapons systems. The task was 
accomplished both according to results of full-scale testing and 
by mathematical modeling. Scientific method foundations of 
testing and commissioning these complexes and systems were 
developed. What is more, the institute's specialists, working 
constantly directly at the facilities, carefully analyzed the 
experience of operation and drew up the corresponding 
recommendations for the troops and the requirements for the 
designers. It is hard to overestimate the productive labor of 
the institute's scientists and specialists. Running ahead, I 
will note that the leading scientists were awarded two State 
Prizes and several Leninist Komsomol Prizes for the research 
performed and implemented in the troops. 
  There is something I would like to say in conclusion. A 
great 
deal of labor and maximum use of intellectual and economic 
potentials of the Soviet state created an integrated missile 
attack warning system... It was, is, and, I hope, will be a 
decisive deterrent factor in unleashing a nuclear missile war. 
For any aggressor will always receive a guaranteed, devastating, 
retaliatory strike. 
  We cannot and do not have the right to close our eyes to the 
fact that the great Soviet Union is no more. The Missile Attack 
Warning System, particularly its above-the-horizon detection and 
position finding equipment, has been weakened significantly by 
the ambitions of politicians who have received sovereignty. 
Urgent measures are needed for restoration of the system and its 
improvement under the direction and control of the government 
and the armed forces of Russia. After all, all components of the 
nuclear missile strike warning system are being improved 
continuously in the United States.

"RPG-7: Using a Tandem Grenade Against a Tank"] 
  [Text] M.T. Kalashnikov-designed assault rifles have a 
worldwide reputation. Much less has been written about our 
portable antitank grenade launchers. Meanwhile they are worthy 
of respect and the highest assessment in their class of weapons. 
The RPG-7 is in the inventory of 40 countries' armies and is 
being manufactured in some of them. 
  The RPG-7's design concept was developed at the end of the 
1950's. An active-reactive ballistic design for an antitank 
weapon (Chief Designer V.K. Firulin) was used in this grenade 
launcher for the first time. In other words, the grenade 
"gathers momentum" using two engines -- launch and sustainer -- 
which provides a significant advantage in firing range. The 
RPG-7 with this projectile (PG-7V) was accepted into the 
inventory in 1961. This design was utilized more than a decade 
later in foreign grenade launchers (Sweden, Germany). 
  The PG-7V basic projectile reliably penetrated the armor of 
the main battle tanks of the 1960's. The employment of the RPG-7 
in a combat situation, specifically in the Middle East, 
convinced us of that. 
  The PG-7VM and PG-7VS projectiles, which provided a greater 
armor penetrating capability with a smaller caliber, were 
accepted into the inventory at a later date. 
  However, the age-old battle of projectile and armor 
seriously 
intensified with the appearance of layered composite armor that 
was developed in England. They used it in the armor protection 
of the Challenger (Great Britain), M1 Abrams (United States), 
and Leopard-2 (Germany) tanks. It is much more difficult for 
armor-piercing and shaped-charge projectiles to penetrate this 
type of armor. The development of the PG-7VL projectile, with a 
powerful warhead that guarantees an armor penetrating capability 
of up to 600 mm, for the RPG-7 was our designers' response. This 
was achieved by increasing the caliber of the grenade, the 
weight of the explosive and improvement of the shaped charge 
[kumulyativnyy uzel]. Indeed, in the process the firing range 
was reduced. 
  The appearance of dynamic protection (reactive armor) 
further 
intensified the problem of maintaining the RPG-7's effectiveness 
(as, by the way, of all other grenade launchers and also ATGM's 
[antitank guided missiles]. Reactive armor is comparatively 
small units that are attached to the main armor of the tank or 
armored infantry vehicle. Elements consisting of two plates that 
are separated by a layer of explosives are located in a unit. 
When a grenade hits, the element's explosives detonate, the 
strike wave and the stream of fragments disperse the shaped jet 
and its energy is significantly lost for penetrating the 
portions of the plates. Increasing the grenade's power does not 
provide increased effectiveness in this case. 
  And yet a solution to this problem has also been found. The 
PG-7VR projectile with a tandem warhead -- with two shaped 
charges located one behind the other-- was developed for the 
RPG-7 under the direction of Chief Designer I.Ye. Rogozin 
("Bazalt" State Scientific Production Enterprise). They operate 
in succession. The first destroys the dynamic protection and the 
second penetrates the main armor. In this manner, our portable 
grenade launcher was the first in the class of grenade launcher 
weapons to provide the capability to combat tanks equipped with 
dynamic protection elements. 
  An RPG-7 with a PG-7VR tandem projectile penetrated an armor 
plate equipped with dynamic protection -- a model of the latest 
tank armor -- at the arms exhibition in Abu-Dhabi (United Arab 
Emirates) in the spring of 1993. This caused a sensation. Just 
like this projectile penetrating through a half-meter thick 
steel-reinforced concrete cube. We can say that the 
domestically-produced RPG-7 portable antitank grenade launcher 
that was developed several decades ago is experiencing a second 
birth.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov report: "Combat </F>
Readiness of Volga Military District Troops Is High"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- According to Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev, satisfaction with the troops' high state 
of combat readiness was what emerged from his three-day tour of 
five Volga Military District troop units. 
  Before flying back to Moscow Wednesday evening Pavel Grachev 
spoke positively during a conversation with your ITAR-TASS 
correspondent of the progress made in looking after subunits 
withdrawn from abroad in the region. According to the minister, 
housing is being built for servicemen at a tremendous pace. 
Pavel Grachev visited three oblasts and one republic in the 
course of the trip and expressed his satisfaction with the local 
leadership's attitude to servicemen's problems. 
  During the trip the minister was acquainted with the troops 
stationed in Ulyanovsk Oblast, visited defense enterprises, and 
met the oblast and city leadership. During a visit to 
Ulyanovsk's "Aviastar" Joint-Stock Company, the largest aviation 
enterprise in Europe, Pavel Grachev said that in the near future 
priority in defense aviation will be given to military 
transporters, whose task is to redeploy forces and weapons to 
any region. This task stems from Russia's military doctrine, 
which places emphasis on mobile rapid response forces. 
  The An-124 "Ruslan" transporter produced by the aviation 
industry with a load capacity of 100 tonnes can replace three or 
four Il-76's in military transport movements. 
  Viktor Mikhaylov, general director of "Aviastar," pointed 
out 
that two new-generation Tu-204's were acquired for the Russian 
president recently. The enterprise also received a government 
order to build three aircraft for the command post of the 
supreme commander in chief of the Russian Armed Forces -- the 
president. In the opinion of military experts, around 100 An-124 
and Il-86 military transporters are needed for the Russian Army 
since the bulk of these types of aircraft remained in the former 
Union republics following the breakup of the USSR. However, it 
will be no easy matter to carry out these projects. Problems 
have arisen with receipt of spare parts owing to the severing of 
economic ties. In particular, the "Aviastar" Joint-Stock 
Company depends on Ukraine, Latvia, and Uzbekistan for supplies 
of engines and electronics. At present the Ulyanovsk aviation 
enterprise is manufacturing four or five An-124's a year and it 
will be extremely difficult to rapidly attain full capacity, 
even with good funding. 
  Pavel Grachev also inspected the Ulyanovsk Electromechanical 
Plant, which manufactures antiaircraft artillery systems and 
antiaircraft missile systems, and met with the command and 
personnel of the 104th Airborne Division, which was withdrawn 
from Azerbaijan to Ulyanovsk last year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb--Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev has been visiting the Volga Military District, where he 
thoroughly familiarized himself with the state of affairs there. 
This is the first tour of its kind that he has conducted this 
year. A large number of units withdrawn from Eastern Europe and 
the former Soviet republics are being resettled in this 
district. During his three-day visit, the Minister checked on 
the combat readiness of the forces and on the progress in 
building military compounds. He visited a number of defense 
plants and met administration heads from the region's towns and 
oblasts. 
  Over 270,000 servicemen have been brought back to Russia 
since 1992. A large number of them are being resettled in the 
Volga region. There were about 14,000 homeless officers and 
warrant officers in the district at the beginning of February. 
Two German-Turkish firms, Tekfen and Enka, are building military 
compounds in Chernorechye, Samara Oblast, and Chaykovskiy, Penza 
Oblast for units of the 2d Guards Tank Army, which is being 
withdrawn from Germany. 
  Construction work is behind schedule, however. The contract, 
worth 200 million German marks, stipulates that 1,910 
apartments, complete with infrastructure, must be completed in 
Chernorechye by 1 July 1994. However, the firm will not meet 
this deadline. It blames inflation, the unreliability of its 
Russian subcontractors, and difficult weather conditions in 
Russia. Grachev was not convinced by these arguments. After 
talking to the firm's manager, he received a promise that 
schools and most of the officers' housing would be fully 
commissioned by 1 September, and the rest of the compound would 
be completed by the end of the year. 
  Construction of housing near the town of Chaykovskiy in Perm 
Oblast is also behind schedule. Enka has failed to meet the 
original deadline for commissioning of the compound--1 January 
1994. The revised deadline of 1 September 1994 is also in 
jeopardy. Not even half the apartments are ready yet. Basically, 
the foreign firms proved to be not fully prepared for 
construction work under Russian conditions. 
  During his visit to the Aviastar Joint-Stock Company at 
Ulyanovsk, the minister noted that development of military 
transport aviation is a task that must be tackled in the near 
future because a large proportion of these planes remained 
outside Russia after the USSR collapsed. Military experts 
believe that the Russian Army needs about 100 transport planes 
of the Tu-124 ("Ruslan") type-- manufactured by Aviastar--as 
well as the Il-86, for rapid deployment of mobile forces in any 
region.

Instructor, Colonel P. Kostevyat: "Radio Communications in a 
Motorized-Rifle Battalion"] 
  [Text] Tactical conditions (the type of battle, the 
conditions for entry into it, and the nature of the conduct of 
combat operations), the role and place of the subunit in the 
combat formation, the combat mission, organization of 
coordination and the command and control system, enemy 
capabilities to destroy it, and also the terrain, time of year 
and time of day affect the organization and support of radio 
communications in a motorized-rifle battalion. Furthermore, 
communications in a battalion largely depend on the condition of 
the equipment and the experience of the specialists. 
  Let's examine how today, in our view, it is most advisable 
to 
utilize radio communications to support continuous command and 
control of elements of the battalion's combat formation and of 
coordinating subunits. 
  Let's assume that a motorized-rifle battalion is part of a 
motorized-rifle brigade and that it has to transition from one 
type of battle to another in a short period of time during the 
course of combat operations. For example, in defense -- to 
conduct an offensive against an enemy that has broken through, 
in an offensive -- to repel an enemy counterattack or, on the 
march -- to enter a meeting engagement. Both organic subunit 
radio communications systems and also radios that are in the 
armored vehicles of the battalion's companies and platoons will 
be used to support radio communications. 
  In certain situations (specifically, while operating as a 
tactical air assault force, in the mountains, on swampy terrain, 
etc.), the motorized-rifle battalion can accomplish the combat 
mission without heavy weapons and equipment. Then they have to 
organize radio communications using only organic portable radios. 
  Consequently, you need to plan radio communications 
beforehand so that it satisfies command and control requirements 
to the maximum extent possible and its diagram does not require 
major changes under any conditions of the combat situation. 
Experience shows that a radio net and a type of its operation -- 
open telephone communications using coded topographical maps, 
prearranged message codes and tables of call signs of ranking 
officers --is the primary method of organization. One of these 
variants is shown in the diagram. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008C-15A>           Organization of Radio Communications </FIG>



  Let's assume that the motorized-rifle battalion commander's 
(an R-14 BM or a BMP-1KSh), the chief of staff's (BTR-80K or 
BMP-1K), and the reconnaissance platoon commander's (BRM-1K) 
command-staff vehicles and two of the signals platoon's BMP-1's 
(BTR-80's) are deployed at the battalion command-observation 
post. The command-staff vehicles of the commanders of the 
attached and supporting artillery, antiaircraft, tank, engineer 
and flame-thrower subunits can also be located here. It has not 
been excluded that the forward aircraft controller (FAC) will 
arrive here with R-853 (R-859, R-809) portable radios. 
Furthermore, communications personnel will set up the 
motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for weapon's radios 
at the technical observation post which, as a rule, is located 
near the command-observation post. 
<H3>  Radio Communications With the Commander and Staff at the 
Next Higher Level </H3>
  It is organized by motorized-rifle brigade headquarters 
communications instructions and it is best supported by brigade 
and battalion men and equipment. 
  It is desirable to support the motorized-rifle battalion 
commander's communications with the motorized-rifle brigade 
commander on two radio nets on HF and ultrashort wave-band 
radios in the open and encrypted modes. In the event of the loss 
of communications, you need to provide for the entry of the 
battalion commander's HF radio into the headquarters' duty radio 
net through a higher echelon. 
  It is advisable to include an ultrashort wave radio that is 
in a BMP-1K on the brigade staff radio net to maintain 
communications with motorized-rifle brigade headquarters during 
battalion operations in armored vehicles. If personnel are 
fighting on foot, you need to carry out communications with the 
commander and staff at the next higher level using a portable 
ultra-shortwave radio. 
  When a motorized-rifle battalion is either the forward 
detachment, a tactical air assault force, or an antiair-assault 
reserve, you need to organize the battalion commander's 
communications with the corresponding commander or staff by 
connecting radios of various bands into their radio net. 
Furthermore, if the battalion is acting as a TVD [tactical air 
assault force], it would also be good to have communications 
with the commander at the next higher level via a separate 
ultrashort wave or HF radio net. 
  We think that it is advisable for the motorized-rifle 
battalion reconnaissance commander to ensure he can operate on 
the motorized-rifle brigade reconnaissance chief's HF radio net 
to obtain the required information. And the commanders of the 
battalion's mortar battery, antitank platoon and attached 
artillery subunit operate in the ultrashort wave range on the 
brigade artillery chief's radio net. They can also receive 
information on the meteorological situation here. The air 
defense subunit commander's radio communications with the 
motorized-rifle brigade air defense chief should be organized on 
his ultrashort wave radio net. 
  If the commanders of the reconnaissance platoon, mortar 
battery and air defense platoon are located directly at the 
motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post, the 
battalion commander has the opportunity to obtain an alternate 
communications channel with the brigade commander through the 
radio net to which these subunits are connected. 
  Obviously the motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for 
rear services and weapons needs to ensure that his radios 
operate on the ultra-shortwave radio nets of the appropriate 
higher-echelon authorities for effective resolution of issues. 
  And one more thing. A brigade traffic control and regulating 
service radio net is created on ultra-shortwave band radios for 
command and control of battalion subunit movements forward to 
occupy defense areas, at the final coordination line and also 
while completing a march. The motorized-rifle battalion 
commander's radio should be linked to that net. 
<H3>  Radio Communications With the Commanders of Subordinate, 
Attached or Supporting Subunits </H3>
  It is best of all to plan command and control of battalion 
subunits on three radio nets on R-111, R-123, R-159 and R-158 
radios. 
  The first radio net is a battalion commander radio net 
(R-111 
and R-123 radios are utilized during operations in armored 
vehicles and R-158 and R-159 radios are used while on foot). The 
radios of the motorized-rifle battalion commander, chief of 
staff, and the commanders of the motorized-rifle companies, 
antitank platoon, air defense platoon and signals platoon should 
operate on it. Furthermore, the radios of the commanders of the 
mortar battery and reconnaissance platoon should be connected to 
it when their command and control posts are located apart from 
the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post. A total 
of 7-10 subscribers can operate here. This composition of the 
radio net will permit the battalion commander to have stable 
command and control of all elements of the combat formation, 
while ensuring close coordination among themselves during the 
course of the battle. 
  We need to note that when the enemy creates jamming and when 
it is impossible to maintain communications with radios 
installed in BMP's and BTR's, you need to shift to operations on 
a radio net using portable radios and, of course, to shift to 
another frequency. 
  The second radio net -- is also a battalion commander radio 
net but one that is already linked to the radios of the 
motorized-rifle battalion commander and chief of staff, and the 
commanders of motorized-rifle companies, armored vehicle groups, 
and fire ambushes. The following may be a part of this net: The 
motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for weapons, the 
reconnaissance (combat reconnaissance) patrol, combat security, 
and detachments for the elimination of the aftereffects of enemy 
use of weapons of mass destruction, traffic control, removal of 
obstacles and other temporary formations. Here we must provide 
for the operations of the commanders of the attached artillery, 
tank, antiaircraft, engineer and flame-thrower subunits. The 
total number of subscribers is high -- 20-22. But for the time 
being there is no other solution. 
  And finally, communications with rear services and technical 
support subunits is organized on a special radio net. The chief 
of staff radio, located in the command-observation post, is the 
main one. It is advisable to include on the radio net the radios 
of the battalion deputy commander for weapons (at the technical 
observation post), the commanders of the VMO [logistical support 
platoon], VTO [technical support platoon] and MEDV [medical 
platoon] and also the armored vehicles designated for evacuation 
of damaged vehicles. Furthermore, the motorized-rifle 
battalion's combat subunit radios can be enlisted to resolve the 
issues of evacuating the wounded from the battlefield and 
delivering ammunition. 
  The last radio net is not created during battalion 
operations 
without heavy weapons and equipment. In this case, the radios of 
the commanders of the logistical support platoon, technical 
support squad and medical platoon can be included on the 
motorized-rifle battalion commander's second radio net. 
  As we can see, the organization of the data of the three 
radio nets in the battalion increases the stability of 
communications and provides the required information 
transmission capacity among all elements of its combat 
formation. It is also quite important that the issues of 
coordination can be efficiently resolved in the process. 
  In cases when the number of radios in the motorized-rifle 
battalion is limited, the battalion commander's communications 
with all subunits will have to be maintained on one radio net on 
ultrashort wave-band radios. This variant is also acceptable 
while completing a march. 
  It is also advisable to conduct the supervision of the 
attached tank company by including the battalion commander's and 
chief of staff's R-123 radios on this subunit commander's radio 
net. 
  If an artillery battalion will support the motorized-rifle 
battalion, their commanders will communicate either personally 
(when the command posts are collocated) or through the artillery 
battalion and tank company commanders' radio nets. 
  Communications with aircraft are provided through the FAC. 
The experience of conducting combat operations in Afghanistan 
showed that he usually arrived at the motorized-rifle battalion 
command-observation post with a portable radio and operated on 
aircraft and combat helicopter command and control and also 
target designation and guidance vectoring radio nets. 
<H5>  Radio Communications for Coordination </H5>
  We know that precise organization of coordination is one of 
the main conditions for the successful execution of combat 
missions by the battalion. However, you won't manage to create 
special radio nets for its support in a motorized-rifle 
battalion because additional radios are needed to do that. And 
yet there is a solution: The exchange of information between the 
elements of the combat formation is carried out through 
reciprocal entry into the appropriate radio nets, for example, 
via the battalion commander's radio net but with the 
authorization of the main station. 
  Moreover, this issue is also being resolved through personal 
contact. This is possible when the commanders of the 
motorized-rifle company and artillery battery are collocated at 
a single command and control post, etc. 
  Thus, we must widely employ the method of reciprocal entry 
into the needed radio nets to ensure reliable coordination in 
the battalion and its subunits. Indeed, with one essential 
condition: The motorized-rifle battalion communications chief 
must think through this issue beforehand and disseminate the 
required radio operating data to the appropriate commanders. 
<H5>  Radio Communications in Battalion Subunits </H5>
  The corresponding commanders' radio nets are organized to 
ensure command and control in motorized-rifle battalion 
companies, the mortar battery and independent platoons. The men 
and equipment of the signals platoon and also of the subunits 
are utilized here. 
  In each motorized-rifle company, radio communications are 
ensured with the commanders of platoons, armored groups and the 
fire ambush on the radio net using R-158 and R-123 radios. This 
same radio net is also used to carry out command and control of 
the crews of the armored personnel vehicles that will provide 
fire support to disembarked motorized riflemen who are on foot. 
  It is advisable to provide two radio nets on behalf of the 
mortar battery commander. The first radio net is for 
communications with the senior officer who is located at the 
fire positions and with the forward (flank) observation post. 
The mortar battery command and control platoon's R-159 portable 
radios are used here. 
  The second radio net is designated for command and control 
of 
the mortar platoons. It consists of the senior officer's and 
mortar platoon commander's R-159 radios. 
  From the diagram it is obvious that, when necessary, the 
mortar battery commander can directly command the fire platoons. 
  Proceeding from the assumption that observation posts will 
be 
sent out from the reconnaissance platoon in the defense and 
while preparing for an offensive, its commander can be located 
at the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post. Then 
you need to organize the reconnaissance platoon commander's 
radio net (on R-123 and R-158 radios) on which communications 
can be carried out with the observation posts. 
  You need to provide for the creation of a special radio net 
for the antitank platoon commander through which he will be able 
to control the operations of the subordinate SPG-9 and ATGM 
[antitank guided missile] squads using R-123 and R-158 radios. 
  Destruction of airborne targets in battle is the mission of 
the air defense subunit; by way of illustration, the SAM 
[surface-to-air missile] platoon. Therefore, here we need to 
have a radio net on R-123, R-147 or R-147P radios, through which 
its commander will maintain communications with the commanders 
of subordinate crews and air defense gunners-SAM operators. The 
latter have an R-147P radio receiver. Therefore, they will also 
be able to receive, in a timely manner, commands for the 
destruction of enemy helicopters and aircraft. 
  The motorized-rifle battalion commander and chief of staff 
must have the capability to enter their radios into the 
appropriate radio nets in order to, for example, transmit an 
urgent order to some subunit or other. This task has been 
accomplished. However, the communications chief must prepare and 
issue them the needed radio operating data beforehand. 
  Now, on the reception of warning signals on the airborne 
enemy or radioactive, chemical, or biological (bacteriological) 
contamination. They are being transmitted out of any sequence 
from brigade headquarters to all of its commander's active radio 
nets. You need to immediately disseminate received signals to 
the personnel of subordinate, attached and supporting subunits. 
  In conclusion, we can say that reliable command and control 
of all elements of the battalion's combat formation using radio 
communications can be ensured through not only its skillful 
planning but also through proper protection from enemy jamming. 
The motorized-rifle battalion has all of the capabilities to do 
that. They only need to be fully utilized.

<F P=106> [Colonel Aleksandr Manushkin "Observer's Notes": </F>
"Reconnaissance Aircraft: They Still Fly Along the Borders 
Despite the Warming of the International Climate and the End of 
the Cold War"] 
  [Excerpts] This is a routine episode from the daily work 
of the Air Force reconnaissance service. Admittedly, now that 
the cold war is far behind us and relations of trust and mutual 
understanding are being established between states, such an 
episode may seem to the uninitiated to be an anachronism. Is it 
still necessary to carry out reconnaissance such as this today, 
you might ask. Well, judge for yourself. Despite the 
strengthening of confidence and mutual understanding between the 
countries of West and East Europe, every day reconnaissance 
planes take off from foreign airfields and head toward the 
borders of Russia and the CIS countries. According to recent 
data in my possession, in 1993 alone NATO countries and other 
states carried out over 2,600 reconnaissance flights near the 
borders of the Russian Federation and our immediate neighbors. 
At the present moment the NATO countries support a whole armada 
-- 470 reconnaissance planes and base patrol aircraft -- in the 
allied and national air forces. The main types of tactical 
reconnaissance planes are the RF-4C, the RF-16, the AMX, the 
Jaguar GR1, the Mirage F-1CR, and the Tornado FR and GR1 [as 
published]. The tactical and technical characteristics of these 
planes are given in the table below. In addition, the U.S. Air 
Force has over 60 strategic reconnaissance planes. 
  In addition to this number around another 150 reconnaissance 
planes and base patrol planes belonging to the United States, 
Japan, and the Republic of Korea and stationed in Asia and the 
Pacific also constantly monitor Russia's borders. 
  To be fair, it should be noted that since the end of the 
cold 
war the intensity of these flights has diminished year by year. 
To be precise, the 1993 figure was 12 percent down on 1992. But 
you will agree that 2,600 reconnaissance flights a year are 
still rather a lot. In short, Russia's neighbors near and far 
are keeping us under constant observation. Incidentally, they 
are doing this not just from the air but also from the ground 
and from space. What is there for us to do? 
  Despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia is 
still a vast state. In terms of length of border and size (the 
area of the Russian Federation is 17.1 million square km), it is 
still the largest country in the world. Russia's geostrategic 
position is unique because it is situated in both Europe and 
Asia and, consequently, it is bound to have interests in those 
parts of the world. In view of that fact the Russian Federation 
is obliged to follow the development of military-political 
processes both in the Asia and Pacific region and in Europe and, 
indeed, in the Near and Middle East, which are just 1-2 hours' 
flying time from our territory. In short, Russia needs constant, 
objective information on the states surrounding us. This 
information comes not just from the words and assurances of the 
politicians. Airborne reconnaissance is one objective source of 
that information, too. [passage omitted] 
  The Army and its most important component -- the Air Force 
-- 
like the whole country, are not having the best of times at the 
moment. Owing to the crisis in the economy and the disastrous 
lack of funds, the command of the Air Force is having to tackle 
tasks that contain many unknown quantities when it comes to the 
allocation of budget money: What is it to be spent on -- wages, 
housing, spare parts, or procurement of new hardware? 
  "Owing to the shortage of fuel, spare parts, and other 
expendable materials," Lieutenant General of Aviation Nikolay 
Rastorguyev, directorate head and deputy chief of the Air Force 
Main Staff, said, "we have cut flights to a minimum beyond which 
we can go no further. Pilots are simply losing their skills." 
  I cannot fail to mention the fact that, as a result of the 
breakup of the Soviet Union and the division of the Army, the 
Air Force reconnaissance service has suffered palpable losses. 
Some air regiments have been disbanded, some "privatized" by the 
former Union republics. For instance, there is one regiment of 
front-line reconnaissance aircraft left in Belarus and three 
regiments apiece in Ukraine and Central Asia. 
  Despite these losses, a Russian front-line reconnaissance 
aviation grouping has in the main been formed today. Units 
redeployed from distant and nearby foreign countries are 
settling down in their new bases and have embarked on combat 
training. And the claims by some mass media that the Air Force 
has curtailed combat training do not, to put it mildly, accord 
with reality. The example I cited at the beginning of these 
notes and a host of other facts attest that the Air Force 
reconnaissance service is always ready to perform and is 
performing its designated tasks. 
  Of course, they are having a hard time now. Everything is in 
short supply. Things are further aggravated by the fact that 
over the last few years (owing to lack of proper funding) the 
Air Force has drastically cut procurement of new aviation 
hardware. That has also taken its toll on reconnaissance 
aviation. The stock of Su-17M4R, Mig-25RB, and Su-24MR planes 
is becoming outdated and worn-out, their service life is coming 
to an end, but there are no reinforcements or replacements. The 
program for commissioning the Sukhoy firm's new reconnaissance 
plane has been disrupted owing to lack of funding again, and 
will the Air Force even have the money to buy it? In short, if 
the current situation lasts another few years, in around 10 
years the Air Force may be left without a reconnaissance service. 
  But what are we worrying about? The world situation is 
changing. And it seems to be changing for the better. Perhaps in 
10 years or so Russia will not have any enemies or adversaries? 
God grant that that be true! But can we close our eyes to the 
fact that neither the United States nor the other NATO countries 
are giving up any of their reconnaissance programs. In 
particular, reports have appeared in the Western press that the 
United States is developing the "Aurora" top-secret supersonic 
reconnaissance plane. With a range of 15,000-17,000 km and a 
speed of Mach 5-6 at altitudes of around 36,000 meters this 
aircraft with its two-man crew is capable of getting virtually 
anywhere in the world fast. 
  AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY also reports that the 
U.S. 
Air Force has allegedly taken delivery of the new "Black Manta" 
TR-3A operational-tactical reconnaissance aircraft. In short, 
despite the fact that international tension is obviously easing 
and relapses into "cold war" are a thing of the past, the 
leadership of the world's leading countries has not slackened 
its efforts to develop airborne reconnaissance systems, but is, 
on the contrary, trying to perfect them. 
  Come what may, Russia is historically destined to be a 
leading world power. And it cannot do without reconnaissance 
(airborne reconnaissance included).

  [Text] [0613.45] [Bardo over video of MiG's on military 
airfield, captioned "Chita Oblast"] Apart from the famous air 
shows in Le Bourget and Bangkok, these latest MiG-29 fighters 
have probably never enjoyed closer attention from journalists. 
The Transbaykal Military District Press Center organized a 
meeting between the Air Force unit's flight staff and 
representatives of the press, radio, and television. 
  Some 30 combat aircraft have been added to the arsenal of 
the 
Transbaykal District. The MiG-29 fighters, to which the Russian 
Air Force is switching, represent fundamentally new combat 
hardware, currently rated as the best in world military aircraft 
construction. It appears that we are still capable of producing 
something to amaze the planet. And while military analysts are 
trying to define the potential enemy and to determine the army's 
need for specific types of weapons, the Transbaykal pilots are 
carrying out their normal duties and rehearsing air combat 
techniques for repelling massive attacks by enemy aircraft. 
  Incidentally, REUTER recently confirmed the excellent 
reputation of this aircraft. It reported that Slovakia received 
a shipment of MiG-29's from Moscow in repayment of a Russian 
debt. [0614.50] [video shows MiG's on tarmac, missiles on

<F P=106> [Article by Admiral F. Gromov, Russian Federation Navy </F>
Commander-in-Chief; this article is published in its entirety in 
the first issue of MORSKOY SBORNIK for 1994: "Summarizing the 
Results of the Past Year and Looking at Next Year"] 
  [Text] Owing to fundamental changes in the domestic and 
foreign policy of the world's leading countries and expansion of 
their political and economic cooperation, the modern 
military-political situation is characterized by a decrease in 
the probability of nuclear missile war, as well as of a major 
armed collision involving conventional weapons. At the same time 
the danger of military conflicts remains in certain regions of 
the world and on Russia's southern borders, including in 
territories of former Soviet republics. This danger has 
economic, social, political and religious roots. 
  With regard for the present trends in the development of the 
military-political situation, the leading states of the West and 
the East are reexamining their foreign policy goals, their 
international obligations and their military doctrine and 
strategy. Emphasis is being laid in this case mainly on 
providing for regional security and preventing crises in 
different regions, with a special role being reserved for naval 
forces and deep reexamination of the concepts of their 
development and use. 
  The Russian Navy is fully involved in this process as well. 
The missions of the fleets in peace and in war have been 
refined, the effective combat strength and numerical strength of 
the Navy are being decreased, new forms of manning the fleets 
with highly professional personnel are being developed, and a 
complex of measures to improve the organizational structure of 
large strategic formations and combined units and to create new 
elements of their basing in the country's territory are being 
implemented. Much work has been done to substantiate the future 
development of both the Navy as a whole and its component 
services. Views on operational use and training of the fleets 
have changed significantly. The extent of the measures, their 
succession and their deadlines have been updated. Their actual 
implementation will depend to a significant degree on 
stabilization of the economy and of budget appropriations for 
development of the Navy. 
  Measures of trust between the navies of Russia and other 
countries continue to strengthen. Evidence of this can be found 
in reciprocal visits and joint exercises at sea. Last year 
detachments of our ships visited ports in the United States, 
Canada, Great Britain, China, France, Norway, Germany, Denmark, 
Turkey and South Korea. Joint tactical exercises, some involving 
combat drills employing practice weapons, were conducted with 
the navies of Canada, the United States and Great Britain. Not 
only did these cruises have political significance, but they 
also promoted further improvement of the naval skills of the 
crews of our ships. 
  The tasks assigned to the Navy for 1993 have generally been 
completed. In the complex conditions of the Navy's 
reorganization and limited financing, we were able to preserve 
the existing combat readiness of the principal large strategic 
formations and combined units of the fleets, and their 
capability for promptly switching from a peacetime to a wartime 
footing in organized fashion, and carrying out their main 
operational missions within set time. 
  Despite the difficulties associated with manning the crews 
and maintaining the technical readiness of the ships, the 
intensity and effectiveness of their combat service and alert 
duty have risen somewhat. Strategic missile submarines patrolled 
their designated areas and maintained alert duty at their bases, 
ready to carry out their missions. General-purpose forces 
supported their ability to stand up in combat and monitored the 
reconnaissance activities of foreign navies. Ships of the 
Pacific Fleet successfully carried out their missions in 
coordination with multinational forces in the Persian Gulf, 
demonstrating Russia's support to United Nations sanctions 
against Iraq, while part of the Black Sea Fleet forces provided 
assistance to Georgia in stabilizing the situation in Poti. 
  Measures of operational, mobilizational and combat training 
were conducted more intensively last year. In them, the 
practical skills of the command and staffs in controlling the 
forces, and the means of operational use of forces in 
combined-arms and strategic operations to repel an aerospace 
invasion by an adversary were honed. 
  Command-and-staff exercises on maps, and joint 
command-and-staff and staff training exercises conducted without 
the participation of designated forces were the principal forms 
of operational and mobilizational training. This made it 
possible to maintain and improve the practical skills of 
commanders and staffs at the operational level to control the 
forces, but at the same time it reduced the number of sea 
cruises by ships and flights by aviation, which had a negative 
effect on the proficiency of naval and air units. 
  Combat training in the naval forces went generally according 
to plan in 1993--intensively and rhythmically. The best results 
were attained by the Northern Fleet, the large strategic 
formations and combined units under the command of captains 1st 
Rank S. Simenenko, V. Shchegolev, V. Krikunov and N. Temerev, 
and submarines under the command of captains 1st Rank V. 
Zakharov and A. Yefanov and Captain 2d Rank V. Kvasov. 
  At the same time we were unable to achieve noticeable 
improvement in combat training. Training and exercises were 
conducted in certain combined units and units at a low 
organizational and methodological level, and they failed to 
provide for full, high-quality work on specific functional 
responsibilities of maintaining the high combat readiness of 
subordinated forces and their effective execution of combat 
training missions. Little attention was devoted to finding and 
mastering new tactics for the forces. Training was often 
dominated by passive forms, without the use of shore-based 
trainers and classrooms. The necessary measures to intensify 
combat training by improving the procedures of exercises, drills 
and training were not implemented. 
  Given the acute shortage of fuel and reduction of allocated 
engine life, stiffer requirements should have been imposed on 
the planning of tasks carried out by ships at sea. Every ship 
cruise should have been utilized with maximum effectiveness, 
with mutual support among different component services in 
practicing the missions for which they are intended, and with 
integrated use of weapons. But these requirements have not yet 
become a mandatory norm in all fleets. 
  Naval Aviation successfully embarked upon mastering the 
Su-27k deck-landing fighter in 1993, completing its tasks of 
combat service with high indicators. Air Force units of the 
Northern Fleet commanded by colonels I. Bokhonko and N. 
Levchenko may be mentioned as having done well. Reasonable 
results were attained by ASW [antisubmarine warfare] personnel 
of the Air Forces of the Pacific Fleet headed by colonels V. 
Udarov and A. Akhmeddyanov, and of the Baltic Fleet Air Forces 
commanded by Colonel N. Somov. 
  The Navy's shore-based forces successfully mastered new 
means 
of combat and prepared themselves for actions as elements of a 
combined air and sea attack echelon of an assault force, and for 
defense of important naval objectives and of portions of the 
seacoast accessible to assault forces, in coordination with 
other naval forces and combined ground troop units. 
  Despite objective difficulties associated with having the 
troops carry out missions atypical of them and the great 
shortage of personnel, the combat training plans were basically 
fulfilled in all combined units and units. Combat training 
proceeded intensively and at a high level of quality in the 
combined naval infantry unit under the command of Colonel A. 
Smolyak. Good results were attained by gunners under the 
leadership of Colonel M. Kumshatskiy and by naval infantry under 
the command of Major V. Novikov. Missilemen under the leadership 
of colonels A. Zabavin and S. Kazachukhin successfully completed 
all combat exercises. Combat training was poorer in the combined 
unit under the command of Colonel Ye. Kocheshkov, in which 
mistakes in organizational work by officers were the cause of 
insufficient preparedness of command and control elements and of 
poor fire skills of the personnel. 
  On the whole, last year the objectives of operational, 
mobilizational and combat training were reached with better 
quality in the Northern Fleet. 
  Unsolved problems in ship repair, in the repair of utilities 
and communication networks, and in supporting bases with 
technical resources, some of which are beyond their useful life, 
obsolete and worn out, also had a negative effect on fleet 
training progress. 
  Equipment failure still remains high aboard ships and 
vessels 
of the fleet. In this case around 60 percent of the total 
failures are technical ones having the following as their 
principal causes: poor work organization, weak special training 
of personnel, and failure to fulfill requirements of the 
leadership and operating instructions. The quality of technical 
maintenance and preparation of ships for sea cruises remains 
low, personnel continue to violate fire and explosion safety 
requirements during potentially dangerous work, and inspections 
of ship hulls, fittings and systems by permanent ship 
commissions are poor in certain combined units. 
  The role of staff specialists in providing for and 
maintaining the technical readiness of ships has been diminished 
in the fleets. Requirements on them in carrying out routine 
scheduled inspections are relaxed, and measures to eliminate 
faults and raise the level of repair training of the personnel 
are not being implemented promptly. The internal resources of 
combined units and ships for carrying out high quality planned 
preventive repairs and inspections are not being utilized fully. 
  The Pacific Fleet combined unit under the command of Rear 
Admiral A. Klimenok was the most unfavorable last year in terms 
of equipment failure. The rate of equipment failures associated 
with ship control did not decrease. In this case half of the 
incidents of this sort occurred in the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The morale of naval personnel is evaluated as stable. While 
the situation aboard ships and in the units is being monitored 
and is under control, it remains complex. Despite unfavorable 
trends, most military collectives are distinguished by proper 
observance of regulations, good organization, and healthy 
cohesiveness of all categories of servicemen, which is generally 
making it possible to successfully carry out missions and 
maintain the fighting capability of fleet forces. This was 
promoted in many ways by the personal example set by the 
absolute majority of commanders and chiefs in fulfillment of 
their official and military duty, by certification of officer 
personnel, and by initiation of the transition to contract 
service. 
  A lack of concreteness in efforts to implement measures of 
social and legal protection of servicemen is a serious 
shortcoming in the organizational and educational activities of 
commanders, staffs and elements in work with personnel. This is 
having a negative effect on the morale, mood and behavior of 
officers, shore-based and seagoing warrant officers, petty 
officers and seamen. As a result considerable tension, conflicts 
and negative trends that undermine the foundation of military 
service--proper organization and maintenance of law and 
order--persist in the military collectives, having a deleterious 
effect on the overall level of military discipline. 
  Last year the Navy was unable to create an integrated system 
of training and indoctrination of subordinates in which all 
elements of military command and control and educational 
elements would participate actively. Contacts with local 
authorities, veteran and youth organizations, creative unions 
and cultural institutions are being restored too slowly. 
Training of commanders and chiefs of all levels and of staff and 
service specialists in educational work is sporadic, and it is 
insufficiently focused on solving particular problems of combat 
training and tightening military discipline. 
  A number of priority measures were planned in order to 
provide for social protection in the Navy. Thus, given a total 
of around 30,000 persons without housing, 6,945 apartments were 
to be built and 344 spaces were to be obtained in dormitories 
with assets appropriated for capital construction. In addition 
1,254 apartments were to be obtained from local agencies on the 
basis of proportionate participation, and 490 apartments ready 
for occupancy were to be purchased. We also planned to open a 
school with a capacity of 534 pupils, two children's nurseries 
with a capacity of 1,300 children, four dining halls with a 
capacity of 955 persons, seven boiler plants, three treatment 
plants and a number of other facilities. However, insufficient 
and irregular financing permitted us to fulfill our plan by only 
72 percent. Consequently the Navy has approved the target of 
obtaining around 11,500 apartments in 1994 by means of its own 
construction efforts and through proportionate participation. 
  Summarizing the results of the past year, it should be noted 
that despite objective and subjective economic, social and legal 
causes, the Navy was generally able to successfully reach the 
main goal--maintaining the attained level of combat and 
mobilizational readiness. 
  The Russian Navy faces complex and important goals in 1994. 
  Regarding combat readiness: The main efforts must be 
concentrated on maintaining the composition and condition of 
naval strategic nuclear forces at a level ensuring guaranteed 
fulfillment of assigned missions in any situation. 
General-purpose forces need to be kept in a state of readiness 
permitting them to repel aggression of local or regional scale 
from the oceans and seas. 
  As before, combat service and alert duty having the purpose 
of promptly revealing preparations for an armed invasion or 
development of a threatening situation and taking the necessary 
steps to raise the combat readiness of the fleets remain the 
principle forms of maintaining high combat readiness of the 
forces. 
  All organizational and technical measures must be 
implemented 
to preclude a surprise attack, and to ensure effective 
reconnaissance, prompt augmentation of the readiness of forces 
and their deployment, and the capability for cutting off 
aggression quickly. 
  Comprehensive rehearsal in organizing transfer of the fleets 
from a peacetime to a wartime footing with regard for different 
scenarios should be considered to be the most important 
direction of improving combat readiness. In carrying out this 
task, we need to attain efficient organization of the work of 
command and control elements and coordinated fulfillment of 
planned measures at all levels in order to raise the forces to 
the highest degree of combat readiness, and we need to correct 
the shortcomings revealed on the basis of the results for 1993. 
Considering intensive implementation of organizational and 
staffing measures and reduction of the numerical and effective 
combat strength of the fleets, we need to constantly account for 
these changes, and promptly take the appropriate steps to 
provide for and maintain the prescribed level of combat 
readiness. 
  Implementing the law of the Russian Federation "On the State 
Border of the Russian Federation," the Navy needs to work on a 
system for defending Russia's state borders in the underwater 
environment with naval forces and resources, and begin its 
practical check-out. 
  We have to carry out a complex of tasks to qualitatively 
renew ships, armament and military equipment, reduce their 
assortment and improve ship basing conditions and all other 
forms of support. The work of accommodating forces of the Baltic 
and Black Sea fleets and the Caspian Flotilla at new bases in 
the Russian Federation, and efforts to withdraw armament, 
ammunition, materials and equipment from Latvia, Estonia and 
Belarus will be continued. 
  Quick mastery of new ships, airplanes, helicopters and 
modern 
types of armament and military equipment entering the forces is 
an important task for the fleets. In order to reach the 
objectives of operational training, the basic efforts must be 
concentrated on high quality fulfillment of planned measures and 
on supporting the readiness of commanders and staffs to control 
the forces during preparation and conduct of operations and 
combat activities. Special attention should be devoted to 
rehearsing organization of coordination of fleet forces with 
combined units and large strategic formations of other armed 
services, and to studying and analyzing the problems of 
operational use of fleet forces in armed conflicts, local wars 
and emergencies. 
  The methods of operational training need to be improved on 
the basis of wide introduction and intensive use of computers 
and of systems and resources for automation of the command and 
control of forces, troops and weapons. We need to actively 
develop and introduce computer games into the training of 
command and control elements, upgrade the quality with which 
exercises, training and lessons are prepared and carried out, 
and strive to achieve an integrated approach in conducted all 
training measures. Operational-tactical and command-and-staff 
exercises need to be conducted simultaneously with several large 
strategic formations which would pursue joint missions in 
accordance with their operational purpose and which would 
operate in a single zone (region). In this case in planning the 
measures of operational and combat training we need to account 
for the economic and financial aspects of their implementation, 
analyze the results, and when necessary, adjust the plans and 
guidelines according to established procedure. 
  In carrying out the tasks of combat training, we need to 
continue improving preparation of combined units and units for 
combat activities within the composition of groupings of 
heterogeneous forces, and we need to seek and master new, 
effective tactics of their use. We need to rehearse formation 
and deployment of groupings, organization of support to their 
combat stability, all forms of defense, and the tactics of naval 
combat with the enemy's ship groupings with the support of air 
forces, fleet shore-based missile and artillery forces and 
fighter aviation of combined air defense units. 
  Preparation of heterogenous ASW forces should be oriented on 
improving the means of seeking, tracking and destroying 
submarines, and on integrated use of all forms of ASW weapons 
utilizing acoustic and nonacoustic search equipment. 
  In tactical exercises we need to continually practice the 
actions of ship and aviation reconnaissance and strike groups in 
conducting reconnaissance and providing targeting information to 
strike forces, and rehearse integrated use of electronic 
countermeasures, concealment and other forms of support. 
  Integrated training at sea must become the principal method 
of combat training. It must be supported by a clearly developed, 
fully equipped and tightly controlled training base. It should 
be organized in such a way as to impose a full training load on 
shore-based trainers, practice ranges and classrooms, and to 
make maximum possible use of command and control systems and 
ship weapon and equipment systems in the practical training of 
the crews. The organization of basic exercises conducted by 
large strategic formations needs to be improved. 
  All of these measures need to pursue a single goal--keeping 
the naval, field and flying skills of the personnel from 
deteriorating. 
  Maintaining ships, airplanes, armament and equipment in 
constant readiness and mobilizing all personnel to maintain 
equipment entrusted to them in serviceable and combat ready 
condition must become a constant concern of commanders and 
staffs in the course of combat training. 
  In organizing government and social training, we need to 
concentrate our main efforts on shaping and improving the 
professional knowledge of the personnel, moral and psychological 
qualities, the readiness to defend the fatherland, faithfulness 
to military duty, discipline, and pride in and responsibility 
for membership in the Russian Navy, with its 300-year heroic 
history. 
  Fuller use needs to be made of this form of training in 
order 
to develop psychological, educational and legal knowledge and 
skills in regular military personnel. Forms of training that are 
most active, democratic and demonstrative, and which have the 
greatest emotional impact, should be constantly introduced into 
the training process. 
  Educational work should be oriented in the new training year 
on supporting the moral and psychological stability and 
discipline of all categories of personnel, on preserving the 
cohesiveness of military collectives and on reinforcing an 
aggressive attitude in the servicemen in carrying out their 
missions. In this case all personnel involved in education must 
be required to exhibit maximum sensitivity and efficiency in 
their reactions to fluctuations in the mood of servicemen, and 
flexibility in their choice of the methods and resources of 
influencing them, and they must consider the unique features of 
each category of personnel, of every group and of each separate 
individual. 
  The primary military collectives--the ship, the company, the 
battery--must be the focus of application of educational efforts. 
  Ideology oriented chiefly on patriotism and professionalism, 
faithfulness to constitutional duty, responsibility for assigned 
work, and the merit and honor of a soldier and citizen must be 
introduced more boldly into the educational process. 
  All forms of organizational and educational work must be 
used 
to attain the highest possible increase in the responsibility of 
each official for the state of military discipline, for the 
state of affairs aboard ships and in military units and 
subunits, and for the effectiveness of measures to prevent 
incidents, crimes and losses of human life. 
  Eradication of jeering and humiliation, of crimes against 
chain of command, of evasion of military service, of outrages 
against the local population, and of misappropriation of state 
and military property, especially small arms, should be 
considered to be a priority task, as should preventing death and 
injury of servicemen, accidents, and disasters involving 
military equipment and armament. 
  One of the main directions in the activity of the commanders 
of staffs and personnel departments, and of all officers, must 
be daily concern for the material and personal needs of the 
personnel, medical services, cultured leisure time for 
servicemen and their families, analysis of urgent problems and 
the of the needs and requests of subordinates, and their timely 
resolution. 
  Officers should be selected and placed with regard for 
certification results. Personnel issues must be resolved quickly 
at all levels, in such a way as to ensure that executive 
positions are filled by trained, promising officers, admirals 
and generals, and to maintain continuity of leadership. Work 
with young officers needs to be improved. Steps must be taken to 
eliminate causes and conditions compelling young officers to 
submit applications for discharge from active military duty. 
  This article describes only the most important results of 
work in 1993 and the objectives of the new training year. 
  I am certain that fleet personnel will carry out their tasks 
with honor and merit. For this, they will need to work with full 
effort, study hard, and attain high end results in their work in 
their assigned areas of activity.

G. Morozov: "The Black Sea Fleet and the New Russian Military 
Doctrine"] 
  [Text] The present stage of transformations in the 
Armed Forces and the Navy requires a new approach to evaluating 
the role and place of the Black Sea Fleet in the life of Russia 
and other CIS states. 
  Historical experience shows that the Navy played far from 
the 
last role in determining Russia's fate. The fleet's significance 
rose especially under Peter I, when his forces attained the 
Baltic and Azov seas. It was then that Russia became a naval 
power. 
  Today, despite easing of the world situation and the 
agreements with the United States and countries of the European 
community on armed forces reductions, it is obviously premature 
to totally exclude the possibility of military actions directed 
against the Commonwealth of Independent States as a whole and 
against any of its members in particular. Centers of tension 
still exist in the world--in the Near and Middle East, in 
Central America [sic; Asia?]. Some regions in Africa, in the 
Balkans and in other areas are restless. And in general, for 
that matter, there's a sense of anxiety in the world community. 
States are regrouping, policies of certain states are being 
reoriented, and formation of new blocs, commonwealths and so on 
can be discerned. All of this is generating instability in the 
world situation, and harbors explosions and conflicts. 
  It is difficult to overstate the place and role of the Azov 
and Black seas in Russia's life on the modern road of historical 
development. We are astonished in this connection with the 
position taken by the leadership of the Russian Federation and 
Ukraine in relation to the fate of the Black Sea Fleet--a 
position that is leading to its disintegration and gradual 
liquidation. The lines of communication in the Black Sea that 
must be defended are something Russia and the CIS need in order 
to enter the world economy, and to develop multilateral ties 
with the world community in the southern sector. 
  Having lost over 20 major ports owing to the collapse of the 
USSR, Russia is now experiencing difficulties in marine shipping 
in this region. The objective necessity for increasing marine 
cargo traffic will force its government to expand existing port 
facilities and build new major ports and terminals in the 
vicinity of the Kiziltashskiy Estuary and rayons adjacent to it. 
In addition the coastline from Taganrog to Adler is around 1,000 
km long. It would be impossible to defend all of this from 
invasion, seizure and attacks from the sea without a modern 
fleet. And as reality shows, now that the fighting capability of 
the armed forces has decreased somewhat due to ill-conceived 
reform, Russia's neighbors have immediately started making 
territorial claims upon it, covertly in some instances and 
openly in others, while in certain of its marine economic zones 
resources are literally being plundered without any 
countermeasures. 
  The situation in the Black Sea is changing as well. A 
certain 
decrease in the potential of the Black Sea Fleet is making it 
possible for Turkey to become the real boss of the Black Sea, 
upon which it is making claims at various forums being conducted 
in this region. A certain "interest" in the Black Sea has also 
arisen on the part of the command of the U.S. Navy and NATO. 
Despite assurances that the United States and Russia are not 
adversaries, the Pentagon is nonetheless finishing its work of 
drafting political agreements on stationing ship formations 
(groups) in Bulgaria and Romania. Given the existing range of 
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships against naval targets--500 
km, and against objectives on land--2,000 km, U.S. and NATO 
ships will be able to hit targets in Ukraine, Moldova, the 
Transcaucasus, in the south of Russia and Belarus from the 
vicinity of Burgas and Constanta. Consequently one need not be a 
great strategist to understand the damage caused by loss of the 
Black Sea Fleet to Russia and other CIS states. 
  On acquainting ourselves with the basic provisions of the 
Russian Federation's military doctrine, we are confronted by 
many puzzling questions regarding discrepancies between the 
doctrine's provisions and reality. Thus, "build-up of troop 
groupings (forces) by the borders of the Russian Federation to 
levels disturbing the existing correlation of forces" is named 
among the factors promoting escalation of the military danger 
into a direct military threat to the Russian Federation. 
However, for practical purposes the collapse of the Black Sea 
Fleet has already altered the correlation of forces with the 
Turkish Navy that had existed on the Black Sea prior to 1991 
from 2:1 in favor of Russia to 1:1 in late 1993. And this 
correlation continues to change in Turkey's favor. 
  The doctrine goes on to say that in order to deter a 
potential aggressor "the combat potential of peacetime 
general-purpose troop (force) groupings is being maintained at a 
level ensuring repulsion of aggression of a local (regional) 
scale." Juxtaposing this postulate with reality, we can say once 
again that what is being done in relation to the Black Sea Fleet 
is hardly supported by the basic provisions of the doctrine. 
  It is written in the doctrine that the armed forces accept 
the responsibility "for providing for action by the UN Security 
Council and other international organizations to support or 
restore international peace and security at the earliest 
possible stage of development of a threatening situation or 
conflict." But for practical purposes no real measures are being 
undertaken to preserve the potential of the Black Sea Fleet. On 
the contrary this potential is gradually decreasing. What kind 
of forces would be needed to carry out the missions foreseen by 
the doctrine in the most explosive contiguous regions of the 
Near East, North Africa and the Balkans? We've forgotten the 
wise counsel of our predecessors regarding the need for 
maintaining a strong fleet in the Black Sea. Experience shows 
that in these uncertain times the Black Sea Fleet has already 
carried out peacekeeping missions in Abkhazia and in the 
vicinity of Poti. The Black Sea Fleet is a necessity not only to 
Russia but also to all CIS states. 
  "The main goal of developing the armed forces written in the 
doctrine is to create and develop troops (forces) capable of 
providing for the defense of the country's independence, 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the safety of 
citizens and other vitally important interests of society and 
the state, corresponding to the military, political and 
strategic situation in the world...with regard for the country's 
geopolitical and geostrategic position." We need to dwell on 
this premise in greater detail. 
  The collapse of the former Union gives Turkey a chance to 
resurrect its past might, which is obviously something its 
government is striving to do. Its political actions and demarche 
in Azerbaijan, Nakhichevan and the Central Asian republics and 
rearmament of its army and navy can be examples of this. 
Statements are being made that the Caspian Sea is a Muslim sea. 
And certain historians are even prophesying domination by 
Turkic-language nations in the next century. Exercises of 
Turkey's 3d Field Army by the southern borders of the CIS and an 
increase in frequency of visits to the Black Sea by NATO ships 
also raise red flags. 
  Having become independent, our former union republics are 
now 
gravitating more and more toward rapprochement with Russia. 
Thus, Azerbaijan and Georgia recently joined the Commonwealth. 
Steps are being taken toward integrating measures to ensure 
collective security. We are coming to understand the 
indisputable fact that on its own, not one of the former 
republics of the Union is able to maintain armed forces 
corresponding to the proclaimed principle of reasonable 
sufficiency of forces for defense. And this pertains first of 
all to ship building. Modern ship building, development of the 
infrastructure and maintenance of the fleet require superlarge 
economic expenditures, which not a single CIS state will be able 
to make on its own under current conditions. 
  The optimum solution is for the CIS to have a unified fleet 
in the Black Sea, which up until this time has been a guarantee 
of stability in this region. The Black Sea Fleet will carry out 
missions in the interests of all states of the Commonwealth: 
protecting their shores from invasion and attacks from the sea, 
covering administrative and industrial centers and troops in 
coastal regions, providing for the freedom and safety of 
navigation and the productive activity of vessels of civilian 
departments in the southern sector and fishing grounds, and 
participating in peacekeeping missions in the Black and 
Mediterranean seas, and in the Near and Middle East. 
  Considering the missions and the defensive orientation of 
military doctrine, the Black Sea Fleet must be founded upon 
highly maneuverable forces, shore-based missile systems, and 
naval attack aviation capable of decisively parrying the blows 
of an adversary. In order to defend shipping interests in the 
Mediterranean Sea and in fishing grounds, the fleet must contain 
formations of large and midsized surface ships capable of 
fulfilling their mission. 
  But if Russia is serious about participating in United 
Nations peacekeeping missions, as the doctrine says, then the 
fleet must contain amphibious forces consisting of fast 
amphibious warfare ships and marine infantry. 
  Threatening no one, and existing under Russian jurisdiction, 
the Black Sea Fleet will have to maintain parity on the southern 
flank of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and provide 
protection to the considerable economic traffic linking them to 
all continents. 
  The majority of politicians in Russia and other CIS states 
are now beginning to understand the obvious truth that neither 
the West nor states of the NATO bloc need a strong Russia, or 
any of the individual states of the Commonwealth. This is why 
all of the West's promises of aid and assurances of friendship 
give way to practical actions sharply contrasting with its prior 
mealy-mouthed assurances. And it would be naive to expect that 
the United States and its allies, who have the power, will 
concede there interests in Grenada or Panama, in the Persian 
Gulf or the Baltic, in the Black Sea or in the Near East, or in 
the World Ocean as a whole. 
  If Russia and the CIS generally want to be a power to reckon 
with, they cannot allow sharp reduction of the fighting 
capability of the armed forces as a whole and of the Black Sea 
Fleet in particular, which are a powerful tool in resolving 
political issues in the southern sector. If we fail to preserve 
and improve the Black Sea Fleet and its infrastructure through 
combined effort today, in the future we will have to overstress 
the economy and impose a severe burden upon the peoples of the 
Commonwealth to restore the former might of the fleet, and a 
breach will appear in the collective defensive system of the CIS 
in the southern sector, into which interested western and 
southern neighbors will immediately try to drive a wedge.

<F P=106> [Interview with Black Sea Fleet Chief of Staff Vice-Admiral </F>
Petr Grigoryevich Svyatashov by special correspondent Dmitriy 
Chumak; place and date of interview not given: "It Is Our Hope 
That the Fate of the Black Sea Fleet Will Finally Be Resolved"] 
  [Text] The Red Banner Black Sea Fleet.... There is so much 
behind these words! The fleet has rich traditions, and a heroic 
past. The whole world knows of the heroism of Black Sea Fleet 
seamen in the difficult war years. 
  But today the fleet is going through difficult times. The 
ships are growing old, and there are no new ones to replace 
them. The seamen take fewer long cruises. The hopes and dreams 
of those who decided long ago, in childhood, to tie their life 
to the sea are vanishing. Many officers who see no future in the 
service are retiring into the reserves. Often with heavy hearts, 
in anger. The delays in dividing up the fleet and the political 
squabbles around it have had a negative effect on the skills of 
Black Sea Fleet seamen. 
  What are Black Sea Fleet seamen doing in this complex 
situation? It's not an idle question--many are asking it. 
Getting ahead of ourselves a little, we should note that in the 
last training year the Black Sea Fleet seamen successfully 
endured some difficult trials. They have something to be proud 
about. They have created a good foundation in their training. 
When compared with the Northern, Pacific and Baltic fleets, the 
Black Sea Fleet is among the best in terms of the results of its 
combat training. Black Sea Fleet seamen have won six prizes in 
contests of naval championship. 
  [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, does this mean that there are 
grounds for optimism? Judging from last year's training results 
and from the way the new stage in the combat training system has 
begun, it might be said that personnel of the fleet's ships and 
units are ready to carry out the most complex missions. I would 
like to know your opinion in this regard. 
  [Svyatashov] I'm pleased that winter training basically 
began 
in organized fashion in the fleet. Commanders, staffs, staff and 
division specialists, and instructors gave some thought to their 
work ahead of time, and creatively planned the training. They 
took account of the situation and the general training level of 
their students. Instructors thoughtfully utilized experience 
accumulated last year in their practical training. Trainers and 
mockups are being used to teach the seamen. Lessons are also 
conducted at duty stations. Rather than playing the role of 
testers, officers who attend the lessons provide practical 
assistance to the young instructors. Training in classrooms and 
offices has become more active. This is an indication that many 
students are striving to become rated specialists. There has 
been a noticeable improvement in the training of young seamen as 
well. They are striving to make it to sea aboard warships 
faster. This fast start in winter training will doubtlessly have 
an effect on the skills of all specialists. Our hope is that 
this year ships will go to sea more often, and carry out planned 
missions. 
  But for now let's return to the training results for the 
past 
training year. The fleet took second place in the navy. The 
tasks imposed on the ship crews and unit personnel were 
completed in full. Practice missile, artillery and torpedo 
firings at sea were successful. Commanders sought the initiative 
and avoided stereotypy in fluid, dynamic combat. The main goal 
was to make the people proficient, to prepare for them for 
action in novel situations. 
  In this regard I would like to make special mention of the 
crews of the BPK [large ASW ship] "Kerch", the SKR [guided 
missile cruiser] "Razitelnyy" and the SKR "Ladnyy", which 
participated in an exercise in the Mediterranean Sea in a KPUG 
[ship hunter-killer group]. ASW seamen displayed a high class of 
work in their hunt. 
  Black Sea Fleet seamen worked quite competently in their 
hunting efforts during a joint exercise with an American ship as 
well. They obtained good combat experience in the Mediterranean 
Sea, and gained confidence. 
  Mention should be made of the crews of other warships, as 
well as of vessels of the auxiliary fleet, which carried out 
their tasks. 
  [Chumak] In addition to planned training measures, the fleet 
also carried out special missions. For example, evacuation of 
refugees from the Caucasus. On some occasions the Black Sea 
Fleet seamen risked their own lives to rescue children, 
casualties and the families of servicemen. Setting off aboard 
their ships to the Georgian coast, to Poti, the seamen knew that 
anything could happen. Were there any who displayed cowardice, 
who refused to go to sea? 
  [Svyatashov] No. The seamen knew that many people in the 
Caucasus were in difficulty, and they went to the region of 
misfortune to help them. The crews of BDK-69, the BDK [large 
amphibious warfare ship] "Konstantin Olshanskiy", and of other 
warships and auxiliary vessels in the fleet displayed real 
heroism and courage in rescuing the peaceful inhabitants. 
  During these operations the forces were competently led by 
Rear-Admiral N. Mikhalchenko, Captain 1st Rank V. Maksimov and 
other experienced commanders. The fleet's assault forces 
accumulated rich experience in "hot spots." This experience is 
being analyzed and generalized. It would be nice if this kind of 
thing didn't happen again. But if difficulties once again arise 
in some region, Black Sea Fleet seamen will always be ready to 
render peaceful assistance. 
  [Chumak] Comrade Vice-Admiral, which military collectives 
especially pleased the fleet command with high indicators in 
combat training despite the complexities of last year? 
  [Svyatashov] There are many such combined units, units and 
ships. Our submariners distinguished themselves: Participating 
in the naval championships, a KPUG consisting of the BPK 
"Kerch", the SKR "Ladnyy" and the SKR "Skoryy" won a prize in 
missile launching. 
  We were also pleased with submariners under combined unit 
commander Rear-Admiral F. Pogorelov. They had it rough in their 
training and their cruises. Captain 2d Rank K. Vasiltsev's crew 
distinguished itself. The submariners won the navy's perpetual 
prize for the second time in succession. 
  As always, the offshore defense unit performed at its best. 
Crews of minesweepers, particularly of the MTShch "Signalshik", 
the MTShch "Zenitchik" and the MTShch "Dizelist", confirmed 
their high class rating in their qualifying exercises. And an 
honorary prize was deservedly presented to the best ships in the 
beginning of the new training year. Captain 2d Rank M. Spalek 
and captains 3d rank O. Vatin and S. Pyatnichuk competently 
organized the training process, and displayed creativity and 
initiative in exercises. They earned their training results. 
  The collectives in which rear-admirals A. Tsubin, A. Aladkin 
and A. Grinko, captains 1st rank N. Martynov, Yu. Kostyrko, N. 
Mikheyev, S. Umnov and V. Krikunov, Captain 2d Rank V. Belenko 
and Lieutenant Colonel A. Smolyak serve faced very important 
missions. Despite everything, these leaders competently 
organized the people in complex conditions to carry out their 
assigned missions. Good organization of service, exactingness, 
and control over execution promoted this success. By the way, 
submariners, ASW specialists, boatmen, signalmen and other fleet 
specialists have also begun the winter training period 
aggressively. 
  [Chumak] How did the fleet's Rear Services do last year? 
  [Svyatashov] Rear-Admiral Bogdanov and his aides approached 
their work competently and creatively. Potatoes and vegetables 
were procured and delivered to fleet storage depots in time. 
Suppliers had to work a great deal in fall in order to procure 
everything planned for the seamen. The storage depots contain 
more than enough, and that's gratifying. This is the result of 
the fact that the fleet's rear services oriented themselves 
promptly in the complex situation, and correctly organized their 
work. Seamen have high quality food, and warrant officers and 
officers will receive their food rations, which is important 
these days. 
  [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, many difficulties arose in the 
course of training and during work on planned missions, 
constraining the people's initiative and sometimes slowing 
progress down. What troubled Black Sea Fleet seamen the most? 
  [Svyatashov] First of all, the uncertainty. People were 
perpetually keyed up, in anticipation of changes. But 
politicians are in no hurry. As for what awaits Black Sea Fleet 
seamen tomorrow, no one can clearly say. However, we firmly 
believe that the fleet problem will be resolved reasonably. 
  Last year there were cases in which training measures had to 
be postponed at the fault of certain executives. And there was 
stereotypy in some practice firings as well. Another troubling 
thing is that certain subunit commanders, especially junior 
officers, have lost interest in service, and consequently 
they've left seaman training to its own devices. As a result the 
number of highly qualified specialists decreased aboard a number 
of ships. Poor training of seamen and petty officers led in turn 
to breakdown of equipment and weapons. The shortcomings were 
especially great in this regard in the combined unit under Read 
Admiral O. Sviridov. 
  Nor can we condone cases of poor organization of alert duty 
and watches, or the absence of proper order. Things like this 
led to disciplinary violations, and to improper mutual 
relations, with serious consequences. 
  This training year, like the last, will not be easy for 
Black 
Sea Fleet seamen. Many unsolved problems are getting worse. But 
we always need to remember that we are military people. And our 
most important objective is to become masters of our work, to be 
prepared, if necessary, to carry out any mission. Therefore we 
need to improve the quality of special training. And this 
quality will depend in many ways on the training provided to 
instructors. However, as the first inspections showed, there are 
many passive officers among them, who have stopped improving 
themselves. What could they teach subordinates? Nothing. 
  Staff workers need to keep questions of this kind under 
special scrutiny. Their demandingness and their interested 
assistance will help to upgrade the quality of training in the 
Black Sea Fleet. We can't allow seamen to be taken away from 
their training, or to waste their time. 
  Much in the course of planned measures depends on 
commanders. 
Where they continually raise the level of technical training, 
display aggressiveness and strive for novelty and initiative, 
order will necessarily be better and organization and 
performance will be higher. But these are precisely the 
qualities that some executives lack. They promise many things, 
but their results are meager. This is why, as an example, repair 
training of specialists has declined. 
  Commanders and staff officers need to keep a constant eye on 
issues like accident-free ship navigation, damage control, 
injuries, fire and explosion safety, the physical fitness of 
seamen and other problems in the course of winter training. 
  I would like to make special mention of deputy commanders 
for 
personnel. They unite the collectives, and do much to help young 
seamen mature and to maintain glorious fleet traditions. Many 
fabulous educators who enjoy respect among the people serve 
aboard ships. They are the ones who are sought out for help and 
advice. Discipline has risen and order has become firmer aboard 
ships owing to many of them. The crews are living in friendship. 
The seamen are happy to serve. 
  However, it would be wrong to assert that things are like 
this everywhere. Some educators were put in their important 
positions by accident. They don't know how to work with people, 
and they don't understand their needs. Such educators can only 
do harm to the collectives. Educational work is especially 
poorly organized in the combined unit in which Captain 1st Rank 
G. Chernokhlebov serves, and aboard the PSK "Apsheron". 
  [Chumak] There have been complaints that some officers, 
warrant officers and civilian employees of the fleet have not 
received their pay and wages for November, December and January. 
How are these people to live? And why did this happen? 
  [Svyatashov] I know that the Russian Ministry of Defense has 
transferred funds to the fleet. But the fact is that not all 
Ukrainian banks are working efficiently. That's were the holdup 
in pay is. But I think that his matter will soon be resolved. 
  [Chumak] Petr Grigoryevich, what would you wish Black Sea 
Fleet seamen in conclusion? 
  [Svyatashov] That they gather up their endurance, and do 
their work honorably. It is the hope of all of us that this year 
the fate of the Black Sea Fleet will finally be resolved. And 
then all of us would see that we have a future. Officers, 
warrant officers and seamen will be able to serve in peace. 
  And one other thing--we all need to live in peace and 
friendship. There are some people who are trying to start fights 
between our Slavic peoples. But this cannot be. Black Sea Fleet 
seamen have stood, and will continue to stand guard over the 
southern borders of CIS countries. 
  [Chumak] Thank you for the interview.

under the rubric "News": "Russia Is Prepared to Compensate 
Ukraine For Its Share of Black Sea Fleet"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  From Sevastopol </H5>
  In response to an appeal from Viktor Semenov, chairman of 
the 
Sevastopol City Soviet, to the President of Russia, Sergey 
Lavrov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian 
Federation, has telegraphed that the Russian delegation is 
prepared to settle the problems of the Black Sea Fleet as 
rapidly as possible. 
  The Press Center of the Black Sea Fleet reports that the 
telegram indicates, among other things, a willingness rapidly to 
conclude an agreement whereby the Black Sea Fleet and its entire 
infrastructure in the Crimea would be used by Russia and flying 
its flags. The Russian side would make the appropriate 
settlements with Ukraine for that portion of the fleet which 
previous agreements ceded to Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Major A. Kazakov: "You Can't Substitute Oats for </F>
Meat"] 
  [Text] There are strict scientific substantiations 
to the nutritional norm for aviators. It replenishes the body 
with what it needs, with what aviators expend while performing 
their assignments in the sky and servicing equipment, and 
ensures flight safety and a long flying career. This is why much 
attention is devoted in all countries of the world to 
maintaining the health and raising the combat readiness of 
aviators. In the times before perestroyka this matter was never 
neglected in the fleet's air units. But recently aviators have 
started experiencing discomfort in their diet as well. Because 
economic ties that had existed in the former Union have been 
disturbed, the thread of fleet food supply has broken. It is 
becoming increasingly more difficult for rear services of the 
fleet air forces to ensure the minimum ration necessary for 
sensible, high quality nutrition for flight crews, engineers and 
technicians. It's now a long-established practice to substitute 
one food product for another of far from equal nutritional value 
when a shortage occurs in a certain assortment of foods. 
Experience shows that such "transformations" are far from 
harmless. 
  A certain food service worker joked to me that if you wanted 
to, you could "translate" the calorie count of even meat into 
oats, and serve them as food. It might of course go this far if 
the economy's disintegration continues at the current rate. But 
I think everyone realizes what the result of all of this could 
be. 
  "We manage as best we can," said Lieutenant Colonel V. 
Molchanov, deputy commander of the aviation technical base of 
the Kacha garrison. "We get the needed food products either on 
the basis of our enthusiasm and personal time, or through 
acquaintances and good relations with various executives. We get 
them from kolkhozes and sovkhozes on credit, on the basis of our 
word. Only the food specialists know what we've had to do to 
manage thus far." 
  Well, I'm not about to reveal the secrets of the suppliers. 
And here is why. A certain article in our newspaper said that 
because electric power had been shut off from the Kacha 
garrison, the command found a way to use local electric power 
sources for the time of the shut-down to keep the dining halls, 
boiler plants and offices running. On learning this, workers of 
the rayon electric power network switched off the electric power 
for 2 days before New Years. The reason they gave was that the 
garrison had its own electric power sources. 
  Consequently food suppliers wisely refuse to say anything 
more about how they manage to supply the needed food products to 
the aviators' dining hall. The whole thing might backfire, you 
see. The main thing is that the suppliers, who take the 
experience of the perestroyka years into account, no longer wait 
for central deliveries, and instead establish direct ties with 
the producers. This allows them to provide at least the minimum 
ration to the personnel. 
  But something does need to be said about the numerous 
instances of disorganization that rear service workers have to 
deal with in obtaining food for military units. Here are just a 
few of them, as related by Colonel V. Yankovskiy, commander of 
the aviation technical base of the Kacha garrison. 
  "We can get meat from Simferopol. But they demand 
prepayment, 
and we have no money in the unit. 
  "It's no secret that we've recently been receiving food from 
Russia. The rail cars travel thousands of kilometers to us. 
You'd think that it would be simple--just meet the cars, unload 
them, and truck the supplies to the unit. But it isn't. Customs 
officials are always on the watch. If you don't draw up a 
customs declaration within 3 days, which isn't always possible, 
they take a large percentage for the idle time of the car. And 
not from just anyone, but from the military units, which don't 
even have enough money to cover the pay of the servicemen. There 
are many such discrepancies." 
  However, despite all of these difficulties, which are 
sometimes created deliberately, rear service workers are 
fulfilling their tasks successfully. And the persistence of 
commanders has a lot to do with it. This is evident at least 
from the following case. 
  Bread for military units of the Kacha garrison comes from 
far 
away. Every trip means many liters of precious gasoline. The 
command of the aviation technical base suggested many times that 
2 days' worth of bread should be delivered on Saturday. Then the 
Sunday trip could be dropped. But its efforts were in vain. It 
was then that Lieutenant Colonel Molchanov went to the bakery 
himself. He substantiated all of the pros and cons, and 
demonstrated that this would be more advantageous both to the 
supplier and to the consumer. And so the issue was finally 
resolved. 
  Then things like this happen. Today there are food products 
in the storage depots, but tomorrow there might not be any. 
You'd think that there would be nothing simpler than to pick up 
enough to last a while, and the problem would be solved. But 
that's not the case. Having become accustomed to centralized, 
regular and constant deliveries in the "period of stagnation," 
units didn't create large storage capacities. And now the 
housekeepers are finding that these capacities are extremely 
small, and can't satisfy anyone. And so, now they have to run 
around each day, scrounging food and making deals with the 
"right" people, so that they could somehow "requisition" some of 
what the aviators are supposed to get. 
  And there's no end to this. The people are weary of it. 
They're becoming nervous, and unsure about tomorrow. This is 
having an effect on mutual relations in the collectives, and it 
is influencing combat readiness. But we can't go on trying the 
patience of men in uniform forever. 
  Wouldn't it be simpler to put aside the ethnic strife, to 
heal the fracture that occurred between Slavic peoples out of 
someone's stupidity, and restore the economic and social ties 
that were broken by the ambitious political activity of today's 
politicians? Divided we fall.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lt-Col Vyacheslav Ilich Kim, chief of Naval </F>
Engineer Services, by correspondent G. Lyubayev; place and date 
of interview not given: "Postscript to a Seizure"] 
  [Text] Administrative structures of the Ukrainian Navy are 
continuing their attempts to unilaterally resubordinate units of 
the Black Sea Fleet's Naval Engineer Services (MIS). The 
Ukrainian side is using the most diverse assortment of 
uncivilized methods of influence to this end--persuasion and 
promises, blackmail and threats, and even demonstrations of 
force. Recently for example, premises of the Odessa and 
Nikolayev MIS [Naval Engineer Services] departments were taken 
under the control of armed representatives of the Ukrainian Navy. 
  How could this have happened before a political solution was 
found for the Black Sea Fleet? Who specifically made it possible 
for the provocative acts of seizing MIS subunits in Odessa and 
Nikolayev to occur? What conclusions follow from an analysis of 
these events? The editor's office is receiving many such 
questions today. In order to answer them, our correspondent met 
with Colonel Vyacheslav Kim, chief of the Naval Engineer 
Services, and interviewed him. 
  [Lyubayev] Vyacheslav Ilich, when and how did you learn 
that, 
for example, the Odessa branch of the OMIS [Department of Naval 
Engineer Services] snapped and is hanging by thread, if I may 
put it that way? 
  [Kim] I got a phone call in the evening. It was from Captain 
A. Sharapov, deputy chief of the OMIS. "What should I do?" was 
the first question he anxiously asked. The situation was clearly 
out of the ordinary. As it turns out, OMIS chief Major N. 
Klyushnikov had quietly transferred his allegiance to Ukraine 
and then acted unpredictably. 
  I couldn't see the details from by distant vantage point. 
Therefore I gave Sharapov the textbook instructions. If 
Klyushnikov did in fact decide to change his place of service, 
then let him leave for the Ukrainian Navy. And he, Captain 
Sharapov, should naturally take over his duties until a decision 
was made by the commander. It didn't seem like there should be 
any special difficulties. But it became clear from further 
discussion that everything was much more complex than I thought. 
The OMIS building was taken under guard by Ukrainian servicemen, 
and this raiding party (15 well-instructed youths) would not 
allow Captain Sharapov into his office, and was generally 
behaving provocatively. 
  Does this mean that someone in Kiev decided to once again 
test the patience of Black Sea Fleet seamen? The plan, I think, 
is simple. If the command of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russian 
side were to confine themselves to restrained condemnation of 
the predatory act, then the violators of the Massandra 
agreements could boldly move further in their forcible transfer 
of the entire infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet to Ukrainian 
jurisdiction. Let them carry on with their presidential meetings 
at the top according to plan, let them seek political solutions 
to the difficult problems, while we at the level of the 
Ukrainian Navy will start another process here--that of 
confiscating another's property and changing the allegiance of 
the personnel, and the spirit of adventuristic attack and a 
freebooter's luck will aid us in these efforts. But can a 
"state" navy be created on such shaky ground? 
  [Lyubayev] The answer to that, Vyacheslav Ilich, is evident 
in your question. How did events develop in the Nikolayev MIS 
department? 
  [Kim] Basically along the same mystery-novel line. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Ye. Krichevskiy, chief of the MIS department, renounced 
his first oath in secret and then took another--the Ukrainian 
oath--together with his deputy, Captain G. Kotelenets. After 
that, the story follows the familiar rut. These newly made 
"officials of the Nikolayev OMIS of the Ukrainian Navy" began 
summoning the department's civilian associates and demanding 
their unquestioning obedience to the new department. 
  I don't have anything against those officers and shore-based 
and seagoing warrant officers who transfer to the Ukrainian Navy 
in a civilized way. That's the right of each person--to serve 
wherever he sees fit. But I can't at all understand people who 
say one thing today and then do quite the opposite tomorrow. 
  After all, no one forced that Major N. Klyushnikov to 
portray 
himself as being faithful to his oath forever. When I met him at 
a conference of MIS department and unit executives I asked him 
what he would do if Ukrainian "emissaries" asked him to stand 
beneath the yellow and blue banner. Nikolay Vasilyevich 
protested with righteous indignation. How could you ask me such 
a thing, Comrade Commander, I never would, for anything! But 
then just a few days later he goes and quietly transfers his 
allegiance and allows the Ukrainian side to seize the OMIS by 
force. 
  The same hypocritical situation (I simply can't find any 
other words) essentially repeated itself in a conversation with 
Lieutenant Colonel Ye. Krichevskiy. He sent his deputy to the 
conference I mentioned above in his stead, and so I had to 
telephone Yevgeniy Ruvimovich, who "fell ill" unexpectedly, and 
ask him point-blank--had he already taken another oath? His 
answer was no. Krichevskiy was not about to soil his honor as an 
officer, he was faithful to the Black Sea Fleet, and so on in 
the same spirit. And then I learned that Yevgeniy Ruvimovich had 
been toying with me. With the first psychological attack by 
Ukrainian recruiters, he agreed to carry out a "revolution" in 
the department. 
  [Lyubayev] The impression is created that the Ukrainian 
naval 
department is "snipping away" at the Black Sea Fleet's 
infrastructure by just one means--from above. They persuade or 
frighten a subunit chief and force him to change his allegiance, 
and then it is assumed that all of the administration under his 
control would transfer to the Ukrainian Navy. 
  [Kim] This is precisely how the Ukrainian side proceeded in 
"disconnecting" the Odessa and Nikolayev MIS departments from 
the Black Sea Fleet. You needn't even ask whether such an act is 
legal. Armed seizure of two of our OMIS sections is a concrete 
expression of legal tyranny which some local representatives of 
the Ukrainian Navy are so eager to legalize. But this naturally 
sounds an alarm: Who is going to answer, and to whom, if 
material valuables in unilaterally Ukrainianized MIS subunits 
are squandered? Officially, after all, Major Klyushnikov, 
Lieutenant Colonel Krichevskiy and his deputy, Captain 
Kotelenets, have been dismissed from their positions and 
discharged into the reserves. But in reality they continue to 
portray themselves as full-fledged chiefs, and no one knows how 
this will end. 
  [Lyubayev] It is but one step from such confrontation to 
dangerous conflict. In response to the forcible act by Ukrainian 
servicemen, Black Sea Fleet seamen might respond with adequate 
actions, and then the stage would be set for scuttling of the 
soon to be held Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet. 
But could this be something someone in Kiev actually wants? And 
is patience on the part of the command of the Black Sea Fleet 
the only reasonable response today to the provocations from the 
other side? 
  [Kim] Judging from everything, it isn't because things are 
going so well for it that the Ukrainian Navy is taking such 
actions against our fleet. When you get right down to it, the 
organizers of such actions can hardly take joy in their 
successes in recruiting certain Black Sea Fleet officials to 
serve in behalf of the idea of Ukrainian self-rule. It wouldn't 
of course be all that hard to gather together a certain number 
of managers like Klyushnikov, Krichevskiy and Kotelenets. 
Except, will this "nucleus of executive personnel" be 
sufficiently dependable and professionally mature? I hardly 
think so. Anyone who once transfers his allegiance isn't going 
to distinguish himself with an exemplary attitude toward his 
work. Personal interests and unfulfilled ambitions are almost 
always foremost in the minds of such a person. 
  [Lyubayev] What type of personnel are the glue, in your 
opinion, holding together the unity of the Black Sea Fleet today? 
  [Kim] It would be the officers and shore-based and seagoing 
warrant officers who are in no hurry to run from one army to 
another, to change their convictions and emblems, and their 
life's reference points. Such people include, for example, 
Captain Aleksandr Sharapov from the Odessa OMIS, who remained 
faithful to his oath, and Colonel Sergey Dybovskiy, chief of the 
Nikolayev UNR, who categorically refused to assist in the 
resubordination of his collective to Ukrainian will. Nor did 
Captain 2d Rank Aleksandr Tkach, chief of the Izmail MIS 
department, give in to blackmail and threats. In order frighten 
him, they told this officer that if he did not transfer his 
allegiance, he would never find a place to live in Izmail, and 
he shouldn't expect anything good to happen in his future. But 
no matter how hard those wretched recruiters try to win over the 
real patriots of the fatherland by their ridiculous scare 
tactics, they can't bring down the unified Black Sea Fleet. 
  It is on this optimistic note that I would like to end our 
discussion. 
  [Lyubayev] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] As we know, Ivan Yermakov, the head of the state 
administration of the city of Sevastopol, was dismissed from his 
position by an edict of the Ukrainian President dated 19 January 
of this year. On 28 February 1991 Colonel I. Yermakov, chief of 
an aviation repair plant of the USSR Naval Aviation, was 
released from his position in accordance with Decree No 1010 of 
the USSR Council of Ministers for his term of office as a 
deputy, during which he was to remain on active duty on the 
Black Sea Fleet personnel roster. Since the moment of release 
from his position, Colonel I. Yermakov has been considered to be 
a member of the RF Navy, he did not take the Ukrainian oath, and 
he has not expressed a desire to serve in the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces. 
  On the basis of the above, on 20 January of this year 
Admiral 
Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, signed an order 
placing Colonel I. Yermakov at his disposal. The chief of the 
personnel department of the Black Sea Fleet was instructed to 
find a position for RF Navy Aviation Colonel I. Yermakov in 
accordance with his wishes and his military specialty. 
  The command of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russian Ministry 
of Defense intend to display concern for the fate of each 
officer in the future as well. 
  A corresponding telegram to the Russian Federation Minister 
of Defense was drafted. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Edward Baltin received a 
telegram from Georgian Republic Security Minister I. Georgadze. 
It read: "Georgia will always be grateful to you for your 
humanity and for the assistance you provided to my motherland. 
My warriors and I treasure your friendship. Warmest regards to 
your command."

  [Text] Over the last 2 months the command of the Ukrainian 
Navy has been attempting to unilaterally subordinate units of 
the Black Sea Fleet's Naval Engineering Service located in the 
fleet's remote garrisons. 
  After the recent unlawful actions in relation to the Odessa 
and Nikolayevka departments of the Black Sea Fleet Naval 
Engineering Service, another action was taken to encourage 
personnel of the Naval Engineering Service in the Izmail 
garrison to take the Ukrainian oath. This is already the fourth 
provocation against Black Sea Fleet seamen serving in this 
region in the last 2 weeks. The Black Sea Fleet unit stationed 
there essentially found itself under economic blockade. With the 
support of city authorities the Military Commissar of Izmail and 
the Chief of the Officer Training School of the Ukrainian Navy 
continue to exert pressure upon Black Sea seamen, resorting to a 
practice of blackmail and threats. 
  In order to normalize the situation and preclude negative 
development of events in Izmail, the command of the Black Sea 
Fleet is once again asking the leadership of the Ukrainian Navy 
and the city authorities to be reasonable, it feels it necessary 
to await civilized solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem by 
the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, and it is adhering to 
agreements on the fleet reached at the highest level. The fleet 
command has sent the corresponding documents on the situation in 
Izmail to the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers.

<F P=106> [Article: "We Await Decisive Actions"] </F>
  [Text] On the instructions of the collective of a 
fleet ship repair enterprise A. Balyura, chairman of its Trade 
Union Committee, made an appeal to the editor's office of FLAG 
RODINY. The text of a document containing an appeal by the 
plant's blue and white collar workers to the Black Sea Fleet 
Military Council was forwarded by him for publication. It states 
in particular: 
  It is with pain in our hearts that we appeal to you, as the 
element of collective leadership of the Black Sea Fleet, to help 
one of the oldest labor collectives of the Black Sea Fleet to 
survive and to preserve this unique plant carrying out 
comprehensive repairs on warships and vessels. 
  An extremely serious, critical situation has evolved at the 
plant; specialists are being forced to work in an atmosphere of 
constant political and financial pressure. 
  One of the main causes of the present situation is the 
absence of any progress in the 2-year negotiations on problems 
of the Black Sea Fleet, including on the status of ship repair 
plants. All of this has of course affected our productive and 
economic life. 
  The plant's work has not been financed since 1993. The 
amount 
the fleet owes for work done now exceeds 5 billion karbovantsy. 
Promises of the command to pay its debts, and equally so the 
promises of the financial services of the Russian Navy regarding 
replenishment of the plant's working capital are not being kept. 
The enterprise's administration is unable to pay wages to the 
labor collective. Blue and white collar workers are no longer 
able to feed their families, while some are simply starving. 
  Being a cost-accounting enterprise, the plant is forced to 
provide for its productive activity and for social protection of 
the collective at the expense of wages, and in order to survive, 
it is forced to accept vessels for repair from all 
organizations, from commercial to private, which are doing 
everything they can to get the plant to work for them. Moreover 
they have everything--licenses, financing, materials, deliveries. 
  It should be kept in mind here that if this tendency 
continues to increase, this naval plant will lose its identity 
and its qualifications. 
  The impression is created that it is to someone's advantage 
to destroy the plant, to destroy the structure of the fleet, and 
consequently its fighting capability. Everyone knows, after all, 
that respecializing the plant would mean losing a unique ship 
repair base, and losing qualified personnel that it has taken 
years to accumulate in ship repair. 
  The critical financial situation also requires immediate 
adoption of a decision by the Military Council to pay the debt 
to the plant in full and to determine a procedure for financing 
ship repair. We see one solution here--providing financing 
through central financial bodies of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense. 
  In behalf of our Black Sea Fleet we appeal to the Military 
Council to take all steps to save this oldest ship building 
enterprise, to immediately restore financing to programs in 
place, and to solve the problems of material and technical 
support. 
  The plant collective awaits decisive actions that meet the 
requirements of the current situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Capt Lt A. Chebotarev: "Running on the Razor's </F>
Edge"] 
  [Text] They stood surrounded by shore patrol and police. 
The young AWOL seamen looked at them fearfully. This time their 
attempt was unsuccessful. But is there a guarantee that there 
won't be another? 
  Mass flight of young seamen from units and from ships began 
around the Spring of 1990. It was then that talk went on about 
the insolvency of the ruling party's military policy, and about 
the inability of the leadership of those days to solve the 
country's concrete problems. But the CPSU ceased to exist, and 
the Soviet Union followed it into history. However, the problem 
of desertion grew even more acute. Now not only young seamen but 
also ones with a year or two of service were fleeing. The 
reasons were the most diverse--from a sick mother to jeering and 
humiliation. But the main causes were disorganization and 
impunity. 
  I'm not about to analyze the state of affairs in this area, 
but I would like to describe the things I've witnessed, and my 
experiences on a few occasions when I took part in court 
examinations as an inquisitor. 
  It is said that a few years' work in court was enough for 
Balzac to write for decades about the human passions he had 
witnessed. This came to mind as I looked at a familiar young lad 
standing under escort. I was to process several detainees 
through the military medical board. One of them, unwashed and 
suffering scabies, evoked pure human pity in me. It was not 
until the following day, when he called out my name, that I 
remembered who he was--he had changed that much. The story is 
tragically simple. Before joining the army he got in with some 
criminals. They stole everything they could get their hands on, 
along the entire southern Crimean shore. Then he was drafted. 
Upon graduating from his training subunit he received the rank 
of junior sergeant. 
  He didn't have much longer to serve. Even so, he ran away. 
Back in with his criminal friends. More stealing. It all ended 
with a high-security prison colony. Moreover the trial was held 
at the time when he would have been returning home from service. 
He had a choice, and he made it. 
  Last summer a seaman went AWOL off a neighboring ship. An 
officer rode out after him, found him, but too late to bring the 
runaway back to the unit. Perhaps out of the joy of having 
liberated himself from service, the former seaman got drunk and 
then went to the river for a swim. Whether he jumped in or dove 
in, I don't know, but he broke his back. His mother weeps, 
naturally, the grief is so great. She blames herself for not 
making him stay in, it would have been better if he had finished 
his tour. 
  The most widespread means of flight is with the 
participation 
of parents. I'm certain that had it not been for relatives, many 
wouldn't even have thought of going AWOL. As far as I know, the 
passports belonging to civilian Smirnova and Mr. and Mrs. 
Poalelunzh, held as a pledge against their son, are still lying 
in the safe in the commander's office. 
  After working 5 years with the personnel I became convinced 
that the runaways often develop a reluctance to serve because 
they were not prepared for service. The young person leaves the 
safety and warmth of his home for a life of hardship. 
Sweepdowns, physical loads, and then rough handling by others 
make their impact as well. Experiencing discomfort from the 
disturbance of the accustomed rhythm of life, the seaman seeks 
solutions, of which there are two. The first is to get a hold of 
one's self and serve out one's tour normally. The second is to 
go back, back home, where one's parents are always waiting. Upon 
returning home, as a rule the AWOL seamen go to the military 
commissariats and procuracies. There statements are always the 
same--they were belittled, they were humiliated. Then, after the 
runaways are reassigned to their respective military units, 
their complaints disappear. Such was the case in my experience 
with seamen Smirnov, Yesipov and Makhanov. 
  I've always wondered about one thing: Why, after so many 
years of existence of the runaway problem, hasn't a system of 
effective measures to prevent such violations and avert their 
consequences not been developed? 
  There are many questions, but no one is offering any 
answers. 
As always, officers and warrant officers end up having to carry 
additional loads. But isn't this out of their line?

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Gladkevich: "The Housing Problem in the </F>
Armed Forces--a Political Problem"] 
  [Text] "It is one step from hope to despair. And it has 
already been taken...." Unfortunately, this is precisely the 
tone of most of the letters coming to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA from 
servicemen, officers in the reserves, and retired officers 
without apartments. The hopes raised by the edicts of the 
president of the Russian Federation "On Measures To Strengthen 
the Social Protection of Service Members and Persons Discharged 
From Military Service" (February 1992) and "On Additional 
Measures for the Financing and Acquisition of Housing for 
Service Members" (July 1992) and by the law of the Russian 
Federation "On the Status of Service Members" (January 1993) 
were first replaced, in their words, by depression caused by the 
obvious unwillingness of local authorities to pay back to 
military people their debts for housing and the decline in the 
rate and volume of construction and then by despair. 
  "For many years, our families have not had roofs over their 
heads," lieutenant colonels Brestel and Teselkin, captains Popov 
and Khramtsov, Senior Warrant Officer Kryuchkov, and others 
(altogether 36 signatures) from Kaliningrad Oblast write to the 
editor's office. They counted on the law on status but in July 
of last year Colonel General Valeriy Mironov, deputy minister of 
defense, signed a directive that permits the dismissal of 
officers without housing from the ranks of the armed forces. And 
this is despite the fact that the law prohibits the dismissal of 
service members who have served 10 years or longer without 
providing housing for them and the members of their families. 
  In a similar situation were Lieutenant Colonel of the 
Reserves Valeriy Semushkin (Gvardeysk in Kaliningrad Oblast), 
who was discharged to the reserves in violation of the law 
without being provided with an apartment, and majors Belichko 
and Ivanov (Kemerovo), who were discharged to the reserves under 
the same circumstances. 
  Alas, here it is not a matter of the "ill will" of the 
military department. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation was itself a hostage of our imperfect legislation and 
lack of a normal practice for the execution of the laws. Let us 
turn to the content of the law "On the Status of Service 
Members." Article 22 of the law does indeed prohibit the 
discharge of service members to the reserves and retirement 
without the provision of housing. But this same law states 
(Article 15) that "citizens discharged from military 
service...are provided with living premies by the agencies of 
local self-administration in accordance with the established 
norms within three months at the latest...." Does not the 
presence of this article in the law infer that...officers and 
warrant officers without housing will nevertheless be discharged 
from service? 
  The readers of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA noticed this total 
discrepancy 
a long time ago. In their letters, they justifiably note that 
even today, a year after the passage of the law "On the Status 
of Service Members," the articles that constitute the so-called 
housing block do not actually work. And Lt. Col. of the Reserves 
Andrey Molostov from Orel has good reason to think: "If tomorrow 
the editor's office receives a report that even one officer or 
warrant officer discharged from military service received an 
apartment within three months, then I am certain that it will be 
published in the pages of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA under the heading 
`Sensation'...." 
  As for the directive signed by the deputy minister of 
defense, it does indeed contradict the law. And this was 
confirmed in the Main Directorate of the General Procurator's 
Office of the Russian Federation in its supervision of the 
execution of the laws in the military forces of the Russian 
Federation, officially protesting it on 8 December of last year. 
On 30 December, the minister of defense of the Russian 
Federation revoked it. 
  Overall, of course, the problem of eliminating the lack of 
housing in the army is a matter of distribution. If only there 
were something to distribute. 
  Here are some figures. In 1993, it was planned to construct 
and acquire 82,000 apartments for military people through all 
sources of financing. And of course the plan for 1993 and the 
state program for 1993-1995 for the provision of service members 
and persons discharged from military service and their family 
members with housing did not completely resolve the problem, 
although they did at least make it possible to stop the dramatic 
worsening of the housing situation in the army and to reduce the 
number of officers on the waiting list to a little more than 
100,000 by the end of 1995. The only condition that they were 
required to observe was the performance of obligations by all 
sides. But practically from the very beginning of the 
realization of the state program, the Ministry of Finance put it 
on strict rations with respect to financing. In the first seven 
months of 1993, for example, the Ministry of Finance was 
supposed to finance capital construction amounting to almost 500 
billion rubles [R] under the program. But actually only R298 
billion were allocated for these purposes. The credits to the 
Ministry of Defense for housing construction were allocated 
without the appropriate indexing, which essentially paralyzed 
the work of the building organizations. 
  And most often the explanation was extremely simple: they 
said that the state did not have enough money for everything and 
that it was necessary to be patient.... "But how long can one 
wait?" write the wives of servicemen of an aviation squadron 
withdrawn from the territory of Latvia to Saransk (Mordovia) in 
1992. "How long can our families stay in hotels and children's 
sanitary camps? We live in extremely crowded conditions, in 
housing not suitable for family life and without basic 
amenities. At the time when the unit was being pulled out of 
Latvia, we were promised that housing would be built quickly at 
the new station. In May of last year, the air force command for 
Moscow District issued specific information, saying that those 
on the waiting list would receive the first few dozen apartments 
by May 1993. Alas, we did not receive anything and essentially 
there is no construction under way--there are no funds. But to 
live in a hotel they demand the timely payment of several tens 
of thousands of rubles. Where can we get this money, if our 
husbands are not paid on time? And there is nothing with which 
to feed our children...." 
  But this is not all. Many local administrations essentially 
did not pay their debts to service personnel for housing and 
were openly scornful of the directives of the president of 
Russia. And this is despite the fact that in Moscow, Tver, 
Murmansk, and several other oblasts they were able, despite 
difficulties, to settle accounts with military people.... Last 
year the military people failed to receive more than 10,000 
square meters of housing space that was supposed to be built 
with funds from the federal budget. 
  And the prospects are by no means favorable for 1994 either. 
A decision by the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation 
specified that this year the construction of housing for 
military people will be financed at the level of last year. In 
the context of the state program with a planned increase of 
11,000 square meters for 1994, this sounds either like an 
admission of the unsoundness of the control figures incorporated 
in it or as disdain for them. In both cases, we are actually 
dealing with the failure of the program. 
  In the opinion of readers, the problem of the provision of 
housing to persons discharged from military service has gone 
over to a second or possibly even lower category. No one is 
carrying out the enforceable acts providing for the allocation 
of housing for the resettlement from military posts of persons 
who have lost their ties with the armed forces. In the military 
districts and fleets, they are more concerned about improving 
the living conditions of regular service personnel. "And this is 
very painful and insulting," reserve officers and warrant 
officers from the town of Gremikha (Northern Fleet) write to the 
editor's office, "we served on ships and in units of the fleet 
for many years and some of us lived all of our lives here, in 
this town with difficult climatic conditions. And now, when our 
health resources are just about exhausted, it turns out that 
there is no place for us in regions with a more favorable 
climate and with medical facilities more oriented toward people 
of our age.... Out of 35 reserve officers and warrant officers, 
only 5 people received the expected housing last year. It may be 
that they will allocate abundant housing to the fleet but will 
it reach us here in Gremikha?" 
  Whether or not Gremikha gets housing, this is a question for 
the command of the Northern Fleet. But of course there is no 
abundance either in the Northern Fleet or in other fleets and 
districts. Everywhere they are on starvation rations with 
respect to housing.... 
  Judging by the mail to the editor's office, those without 
apartments have long since quit believing that there is no money 
for the construction of housing. "They can come up with hundreds 
of millions of dollars for the building of a parliamentary 
center, but is this the most acute problem in Russia?" asks 
Stepan Ugolnikov from Saratov. And he draws this conclusion: 
there is money but there is no order, there are laws but there 
is no respect for them, and there are responsible persons but 
they are not taking their responsibility very seriously. And one 
can find solutions but one must make a genuine search for them. 
  By the way, the editor's office of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has 
received many proposals on this in its mail. The most 
constructive of them essentially amount to the following: if 
there is a particular legislative base, there needs to be a 
mechanism for the realization of the laws, a mechanism based on 
the strictest responsibility of officials, administrative heads, 
managers of ministries and departments, and members of the 
cabinet of ministers for the execution of the laws. The tasks 
defined by the programs that constitute state policy with 
respect to the armed forces must be resolved whatever the 
difficulties may be.... 
  To a certain extent, the constructiveness of these proposals 
is relative. This, in a manner of speaking, is the 
constructiveness of the object of state policy, the human being 
who does not bring about a solution but expects one. 
Nevertheless.... Some readers are proposing the allocation of 
long-term loans at a favorable rate of interest (and possibly no 
interest at all) to military personnel without housing and to 
those who have been discharged from military service for the 
construction of housing, the transfer of all the funds from 
varous sources of financing to a single customer for housing 
(the Ministry of Defense), and so on. But Vladimir Sergeyevich 
Katin, to whom, as he writes, it is painful to see the disorder 
of Russian military personnel, is proposing to the government 
and Ministry of Defense that they pay closer attention to the 
so-called unfinished construction: "At the central farmstead of 
the joint stock company "Velikopolye" (Smolensk Oblast), there 
are 10 unfinished two-apartment cottages, which the sovkhoz 
began to build for its workers in 1989-1990 but did not 
complete. They should have finished building them on a shared 
basis with "Velikopolye" and you would have seen that several 
families of military people would have had a roof over their 
heads...." But whatever might have been heard, it appears that 
all of this is nothing new for those who are obligated by their 
official position to solve the problem of overcoming the lack of 
housing in the army. They know all of this or at least should 
know it.... 
  Today it is already obvious that the resolution of the 
housing problem in the armed forces is not so much a social and 
economic task as it is a political one. Russia is a state in the 
process of reform and this process has just begun to get under 
way seriously. In such a situation, sensible politicians are 
doing everything they can to strengthen the institutions of 
power (and the armed forces are one of them). To allow the army 
or in any case a large detachment of people who comprise it to 
continue along the path of disappointment in the current 
authority, along the path leading from hope to despair, is at 
least imprudent. After all, the palette of human moods is not 
limited to despair....

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kirsanov: "The Routes are New, the </F>
Problems Old"] 
  [Text] The adoption of the military doctrine 
of Russia, which has a clearly pronounced defensive tendency, 
compels us to rethink many problems not only of the country's 
military development, but also of its economic development. 
Improvement of the transportation system is one such problem. 
  Transportation has always had enormous military importance 
at 
all times and in all countries. In the history of war there are 
many examples of failures of strategic operations, when military 
campaigns and whole wars were lost because of the disruption of 
operations or poor development of lines of communications. And 
in Russia, with its great expanses, transportation lines and 
railroads in particular have always played a special role. 
  Now, under new conditions, the Russian Armed Forces are 
confronted by new tasks: To improve the methods of building up 
forces in specific strategic and operational sectors with 
limited manpower; to have mobile forces ready to go to any point 
in the country on short notice; to assimilate methods of 
strategic and operational deployment and regrouping which are 
adequate to present-day conditions. It is impossible to assure 
accomplishment of these tasks without full allowance for the 
transportation factor. This must also be taken into account when 
creating troop groupings in strategic sectors, in supporting 
their communications both with military district 
materiel-suppliers and with one another. There is a broad 
spectrum of questions here: accomplishment of military transport 
movements, freight delivery, technical support and restoration 
of lines of communications. And all of this under the real and 
difficult conditions of transition to the market. 
  For now, I believe, these problems are not being given due 
attention. The reason? It is because military strategy and the 
concepts of types of transportation have been developing 
recently as if independent of one another. But not a single 
operational plan is conceivable without allowance for the 
transportation factor; in every strategic sector the 
transportation system has its own parameters and at times they 
are very limited ones. 
  Also, one cannot ignore the fact that in the last few years 
the military sphere has been quite "dynamic," while 
transportation systems have been rather inert in their 
development. The service lives of the basic structures, roads, 
landing strips, ports, and canals reach 70 to 100 years, those 
of pipelines 25 to 30 years or more, and for locomotives, rail 
cars and ships, 15 to 30 years. For this reason, the development 
of the transportation system must be laid out for the future 
with allowance both for economic indices and for defense 
requirements. 
  For a start, let us try to compare the extent to which the 
actual state of affairs in transportation corresponds to the 
current requirements of the Armed Forces. In brief, there are 
few grounds for optimism here. The Russian lag in terms of roads 
has already become notorious. For example, in the U.S. the 
length of the transportation net is six times longer and its 
density 14 times greater than it is in Russia. This makes it 
possible to have a 3- to 4-fold margin of through-put capacity 
of transportation lines for creation of the necessary reserves 
and conduct of planned repair tasks without disrupting the 
rhythm of shipments. It is also possible to rationally 
distribute the volume of shipments among the types of 
transportation. Even when we had a more stable economy, this was 
something we could only dream of, all the more so now in the 
reform period. 
  Railroad lines and highways are in unsatisfactory technical 
condition over significant stretches, and require 
reconstruction. Volumes of road work have decreased recently by 
20 to 25 percent. Wear of the basic stock in transportation is 
approaching 40 percent. In the last twenty years there have been 
reductions in the volume of deliveries of freight cars for 
railroad transport, and this has led to intense aging of the 
rail-car inventory. In track facilities, 300 thousand tonnes of 
the total mass of metal frameworks of bridges require 
replacement. 
  The situation is no better in other branches of the 
transportation system. For instance, the seagoing fleet, which 
in the years of the USSR was the sixth-largest in the world, has 
markedly diminished. The share of it which went to Russia turned 
out to be out of balance, and the age of the Russian vessels 
proved to be much greater than that of those which went to the 
other independent states. More than third of the wharf 
facilities of Russian ports require repair and reconstruction. 
According to predictions of experts, most of the 
second-generation aircraft inventory must be written off by the 
year 2000 due to exhaustion of service life. But because of a 
lack of resources, the program for renewal of the aircraft 
inventory is being delayed. The air disaster at Irkutsk once 
again confirms the fact that this problem has to be resolved, 
otherwise the number of accidents and disasters will grow. There 
are also problems with pipeline transportation. The time has 
come to renovate a large number of pipes and compression 
equipment in a number of main sectors, since the questions of 
safety of further operations will greatly depend on this. 
  Now other factors also affect the rhythm of shipments. These 
include problems with energy resources, the change in 
transportation economic ties, and legal questions. Difficulties 
arise with respect to unhindered passage of cargoes over 
territories of adjacent states without abridgement of the 
interests of Russian shippers and consignees. In these cases, 
the need often arises to divert the shipments in other 
directions, or to switch to other types of transportation. Or it 
is simply necessary to change the shipment deadlines. This is 
one thing when the cargo is civilian, but quite another when it 
is military, and often poses a potential danger during transport. 
  Even this cursory listing of the problems of the country's 
transportation system suffices for one to understand that under 
these conditions, it is quite problematic for the Armed Forces 
to meet the requirements of military doctrine with respect to 
the transportation factor. In what way can we raise the mobility 
of units and formations? The choice has been made, and as I see 
it, it has been made correctly in the prevailing situation. In 
the doctrine, a course has been set toward priority development 
of military transport aviation. 
  But this is clearly insufficient to raise troop mobility. 
Military Transport Aviation can accomplish only a comparatively 
small part of the deployment of the Armed Forces or the 
regroupings they carry out. So we must consider the 
transportation system of Russia as a whole for this purpose: 
Rail, water and air transport and oil pipelines in combination, 
in specific strategic sectors, taking into account the 
transportation support of the particular theater of military 
operations. Each type of transportation must have its own 
reserves, and troop mobility must be achieved first of all 
through these reserves. But as I see it, in normal mode Military 
Transport Aviation must ensure against "bottlenecks" in the 
transportation system and perform the most urgent movements of 
troops and cargoes. But in general, defense transportation needs 
at this stage must become the subject of special scientific 
research. 
  Alas, there are no specific developments on this topic. And 
not only the immediate future is vague. Military doctrine still 
does not influence the strategic development of transportation 
in Russia either. At present a special targeted state program, 
"Transport Rossii" [Russian Transportation] is being developed, 
in which the questions of its stability, profitability, 
controllability, manning and much else must be considered. 
  It would be good if the questions of transportation support 
of the Armed Forces were also fully reflected in it. In 
particular, in the near future we must take a serious look at 
questions of preparation of new points for unloading and loading 
troops and temporary transfer areas, development of military 
requirements on new transportation resources, and also on the 
means of control, and the transportability of new types of 
armaments and military equipment. We need the appropriate 
approaches to the development of new high-speed roads. This is 
only one example. At present, the possibility of construction of 
a high-speed Moscow-Brest-Warsaw-Berlin-Paris rail line is being 
examined. It will allow our country to join the Unified 
High-Speed Net with a track gauge of 1.435 mm. But this in turn 
will greatly complicate the technical support and restoration of 
this line on the territory of Russia from the standpoint of 
defense requirements. And even now many such problems are 
arising. 
  The tone is now set by the economy in transportation 
strategy. The basic volume of railroad construction in the 
foreseeable future will go to the Asiatic part of the country, 
in connection with the economic conquest of new regions. The 
construction of the Berkakit-Yakutsk railroad line will be a 
kind of beachhead for the future creation of a supporting system 
of railroads in the eastern part of the country with possible 
extension subsequently to Magadan and on to Chukotka, Kamchatka, 
and the U.S. transportation system. The 
Surgut-Urengoy-Igarka-Norilsk line under construction is 
intended to provide all-weather communications with the Norilsk 
mining and metallurgical combine. 
  Talk that the Russian economy will grow Siberia has already 
become a cliche, but what will grow the combat capacity and 
mobility of the Armed Forces? 
  And finally, under present conditions the problem of 
"transportation and conversion" is a very important one. In my 
view it requires the closest attention from the standpoint of 
all structures and priority financing, because this is precisely 
the case in which, by switching defense enterprises to peacetime 
channels, one can both effectively influence the development of 
the Russian economy and help raise the combat capacity of the 
Army and Navy. The production of transport planes, dry-cargo 
ships, tankers, road-building machinery and so forth 
indisputably will most effectively raise military potential, 
whose level is set by the military doctrine of Russia. I think 
that this direction in conversion of military industry must 
become one of the highest priorities.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian </F>
Federation deputy defense minister: "Russia's `Blue Helmets'"] 
  [Text] With the change in the geopolitical situation in 
the world the participation of states, blocs, and public and 
state structures in peacekeeping activity is put forward as a 
priority avenue of their foreign and military policy. 
  The process of the formation of the CIS and also of states 
which do not belong to this Commonwealth on the territory of the 
former USSR and the existence of contradictions within them and 
in some cases between them have led us to an understanding of 
the need to create peacekeeping forces. Under present 
conditions, when the European states that are CIS members are 
displaying no interest in resolving armed conflicts by their own 
efforts, Russia remains the only state with the military and 
technical resources to conduct operations to maintain and 
restore peace and is confirming this by its practice. 
  Of course, Russia directs its main efforts toward settling 
crisis situations and armed conflicts in the regions directly 
adjacent to its borders, since stability in these territories is 
of vital importance for the Russian state and its citizens, 25 
million of whom live in nearby foreign parts. It has been and 
remains the only force capable of separating the warring sides 
and sitting them down at the conference table. Life itself 
shows that no international organization or group of states can 
replace our peacekeeping efforts on the territory of the former 
USSR. 
  At the same time we by no means rule out the enlistment of 
peacekeeping forces under the UN or CSCE flag if, in the world 
community's opinion, the need for that arises. 
  Russia's responsibility as a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council for maintaining international peace and 
security and as a state which bears the main brunt of 
peacekeeping activity on the territory of the former USSR is 
reflected in the Russian Federation Constitution, the law on 
defense, the military doctrine, and other normative acts which 
indicate directly that Russia assists the efforts of the world 
community and various organs of collective security to prevent 
armed conflicts and maintain or restore peace by the decision of 
the UN Security Council or in accordance with international 
commitments. 
  Thus for the first time peacekeeping in Russia has been 
promoted to the rank of state policy. 
  The history of our state's peacekeeping goes back to 1973, 
when the first 36 Soviet military observers took part under the 
UN flag in the operation to monitor the conditions of the 
cease-fire in the Near East. 
  In subsequent years military observers have taken part in 
peacekeeping operations under UN auspices in Egypt, Israel, 
Syria, Lebanon, on the Iraq-Iran border, in the Western Sahara, 
Cambodia, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. On two 
occasions Russian military observers have been in Abkhazia along 
the river Gumista where they confidently fulfilled their duties 
and the bloodshed was halted for a while. And only the warring 
sides' unconstructive policy prevented an end to the war in that 
region at the time. 
  There was also a good chance of ending the war on the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani border in September 1992 when to implement 
the terms of the defense ministers' Sochi agreement, Russia, 
Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan were to assign 
military observers to five zones of responsibility. But only 
Russia did this. 
  To this day 105 Russian military observers are continuing 
this hard service in many of the planet's trouble spots. 
  The failure to take decisive steps in nearby foreign parts 
could plunge former regions of the USSR into even greater 
bloodletting and the flames of war could move directly to 
Russian territory. In accordance with interstate agreements the 
Defense Ministry, without waiting for the adoption of a 
legislative base on the peacekeeping forces, formed nine 
battalions of Russian troops and sent them to South Ossetia, the 
Republic of Georgia, and the Dniester Region of the Republic of 
Moldova in the summer and fall of 1992. 
  At the same time at the request of the Tajik Government 
units 
of the 201st Motorized-rifle Division were ordered by the 
Russian leadership to perform peacekeeping tasks and in the fall 
of 1993 CIS Collective Peacekeeping Forces from Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan were formed and 
introduced to the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  The development of events in the south of Russia itself (the 
situation in Ingushetia) and the absence of legislative acts on 
the peacekeeping forces and the mechanism for activating them 
made it necessary in order to end the bloodshed and maintain law 
and order on the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia in 
accordance with the Russian Federation President's edict to 
create a combined group of troops of about 12,000 men from the 
troops of the North Caucasus Military District and the Internal 
Affairs Ministry internal troops. Today the numerical strength 
of the Russian Army servicemen performing peacekeeping tasks is 
over 16,000. 
  The experience of the Russian "Blue Helmets'" participation 
in settling military conflicts in nearby foreign parts enriches 
world experience of peacekeeping. Thus their introduction to 
zones of armed confrontation has been carried out under 
conditions of continuing fire and their mission included 
separating the warring sides. Another new element is that 
alongside Russian peacekeepers representatives of the 
conflicting sides and not only of neutral states are 
participants in the operation to restore and maintain peace. 
  The establishment of Russia's peacekeeping forces is taking 
place under complex conditions. We realize that the settlement 
of armed conflicts is the common business of states of the 
relevant region and the world community as a whole. 
Consequently the burden of expenses should be shared between 
them. This principle has been reflected in a number of 
bilateral and multilateral agreements within the framework of 
the CIS. 
  But most regrettably as of today in all trouble spots of the 
former Union. Russia, as the mediator in the solution of 
conflicts and with contingents of peacekeeping forces, which 
surpass all other participants in the peacekeeping operations in 
terms of personnel, equipment, and weapons, sometimes being 
several times larger, receives no compensation for its 
participation. 
  Moreover, funds for conducting peacekeeping operations are 
not allocated from the federal budget and the financing of the 
participation of the military contingent in peacekeeping 
operations is through Defense Ministry funds. 
  The question of compensating for expenditure on these 
purposes through subscriptions by states within the CIS 
framework in accordance with the protocol of the Tashkent 
meeting of heads of CIS states (May 1992) remains unimplemented. 
  Many politicians in the West are now speaking increasingly 
frequently of our allegedly minor participation in peacekeeping 
operations, unfairly restricting the numerical strength of the 
peacekeeping forces to a battalion in Yugoslavia and observers. 
In our view the new but noble mission of preventing bloodshed 
should not be restricted to the political interests of 
individual states but should be determined by the quantity of 
the forces and funds used in humanitarian missions. It would be 
fairer to view expenditure on financing these operations as a 
direct proportionate contribution by Russia to the UN budget for 
peacekeeping operations and to grant these operations a UN (or 
CSCE) mandate). 
  In connection with the well known events in our political 
life no legislative acts have yet been adopted on Russia's 
peacekeeping forces. Their status has not been determined. The 
armed forces contingents performing peacekeeping functions are 
only assigned as peacekeeping forces by orders of the defense 
minister. The mechanism for supplying (activating) these forces 
has not been regulated either. 
  When planning operations to maintain and establish peace it 
is essential to proceed from the premise that peacekeeping tasks 
should be performed not by line units of the armed forces but by 
specially created professionally trained peacekeeping forces 
equipped for the purpose. Their numerical strength and 
composition, the procedure for their use, and a whole series of 
other questions must be precisely regulated by the state. 
Unfortunately not everyone in our country yet understands that 
the creation, staffing, and use of peacekeeping forces must be 
determined legislatively by the supreme organs of state power 
and not by the Defense Ministry. 
  Therefore in our view the priority task is the elaboration 
and adoption of a Concept for Russia's participation in 
peacekeeping activity and a law "on the procedure for supplying 
peacekeeping forces for participation in peacekeeping 
operations." It is also essential to approve their status 
(position), that is to put a legal normative basis under Russian 
peacekeeping. 
  At the same time one or two motorized-rifle divisions of the 
Ground Troops (15,000-16,000 men) must be transferred to a new 
organizational staff structure meeting the requirement for 
autonomy when subunits perform peacekeeping missions. We have 
now voiced proposals for putting these forces outside the treaty 
framework for conventional arms limitation. It is also 
necessary to create the appropriate material training base for 
training them. The first sections of the training centers for 
the 27th and 45th motorized-rifle divisions have already been 
virtually created. But for the higher quality training of 
personnel for operations in unusual conditions it is necessary 
to improve them considerably. And again the question is based 
on the financial famine which the armed forces chronically 
experience. 
  The creation of Russia's peacekeeping forces should in our 
view be implemented on the basis of the principles of the 
compliance of their organizational structure, composition, and 
numerical strength with the requirements of military doctrine, 
with the concept of Russia's security, and with its 
international commitments, centralized leadership, the maximum 
use of the existing military potential and existing structures, 
and a consideration for the continuity of national traditions, 
the norms of international law, and the experience of other 
states. 
  They must include Defense Ministry units and subunits 
(military contingents), military, civilian, and militia 
personnel (the leading staff of the mission, observers, and 
experts), and communications, support, and servicing and 
maintenance subunits. 
  Staffing with privates and sergeants should be (and already 
is) only on a voluntary basis. Contracts should be concluded 
with people who as a rule have already served in line units. 
Today there are obviously not enough professional servicemen 
under contract in the peacekeeping forces units. That is the 
result of the discrepancy between material incentives and the 
risk to life and the conditions of service of the "peacekeepers." 
  Peacekeeping forces' subunits must be staffed fully before 
their training for peacekeeping activity begins. Right now 
because of difficulties over staffing subunits often have to be 
"assembled" at the last minute before being sent to armed 
conflict zones. 
  By a decision of the Russian Federation Government an 
Interdepartmental Coordination Commission has been created to 
pool the efforts of ministries, committees, and departments on 
questions of peacekeeping activity. Its organizational and 
legal documents are being drafted. A Sector [napravleniye] for 
Leadership of the Peacekeeping Forces has been operating in the 
Defense Ministry for over a year now and controls the training 
of peacekeeping forces subunits and their fulfillment f 
missions. Unfortunately, because of its small size a number of 
issues of a state law nature and of international and public 
peacekeeping activity are beyond the sector's purview. These 
questions are resolved by many directorates of the Defense 
Ministry but for more high-quality and effective work it would 
be desirable to unite these peacekeeping functions in a single 
body. 
  In connection with the growth of the growth of the scale of 
the peacekeeping forces' participation in the maintenance of 
peace, in the United Nations the structure of the organs of 
management is being improved and a professional military staff 
is being formed for the operational control of forces assigned 
by the United Nations. A special committee for improving 
peacekeeping operations is being instituted under the UN 
Security Council. 
  Theoretical questions of the preparation and implementation 
of peacekeeping operations are also being elaborated, in 
particular the NATO and U.S. concept for settling crises and 
armed conflicts and the concept of second-generation operations, 
and vigorous work is being performed to create UN "reserve 
forces." 
  Russia is taking an active part in all these questions. In 
particular the question of including the 27th motorized rifle 
division in the UN "reserve forces" has been successfully 
resolved and consultations are under way on questions of 
peacekeeping activity between Russian representatives and 
international organizations (the United Nations, CSCE, North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council, NATO, and others) and on a 
bilateral basis. In July 1994 it is planned to hold the first 
joint Russian-U.S. command staff peacekeeping exercise. 
Russia's 27th Motorized-rifle Division and the United States' 
third infantry division will take part. 
  Russia's "Blue Helmets" now stand between the warring sides 
in conflicts. By their activity they ensure cease-fires and 
create conditions for a definitive settlement of conflicts by 
political means. Despite a number of unresolved questions, they 
are honorably performing their hard service, so essential today 
in many regions.

<F P=106> [Article by Major-General Ivan Shtopenko, chief of the </F>
Finance Directorate of the Ministry of Defense [MO] of Ukraine: 
"The State Has Fallen Into Debt to Its Defenders"] 
  [Text] There have been more and more letters to the 
editors in the mail of NARODNA ARMIYA lately (the content of one 
of which is presented below). 
  "I appeal to you in the name of the employees of the 
military hospital," writes trade-union member Yaroslav 
Mykhaylovych Salabay. "The approach of paydays in the last few 
months has caused discontent, nervousness and various types of 
discussions and gossip among people. That is because no one 
knows whether they will be paid the proper wages on time or not. 
  "Whereas the pay used to be delayed only a few days, in 
September we were paid on the 18th of the month instead of the 
5th or 6th. The same thing happened in October. More than half 
of it went by, and the pay had still not been issued. And that 
is while the latest price increases were occurring. People were 
left without money, without the means of existence. 
  "The hospital employees have a natural question for the 
finance workers: How much longer will this go on? This is a 
mockery of the people. Matters have gotten so bad that the 
patients are not getting food, since the hospital has nothing 
with which to pay the stores..." 
  Letters with similar content, as you know, are being 
sent to other places besides the central publishing organ of the 
Ministry if Defense. Many of them have arrived directly at the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, so the editors of NARODNA ARMIYA 
appealed directly to the Chief of the Finance Directorate of the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Major-General Ivan Shtopenko, 
with the request to comment on the situation that has taken 
shape lately with the payment of monetary sustenance to the 
servicemen, as well as wages to the employees, of the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine. 
  The profound socio-economic crisis that has struck the state 
has hit first and foremost the least well-protected segments of 
the population; among whom, notwithstanding the host of 
legislation that has been passed, are the servicemen and the 
members of their families. The Ministry of Defense, owing to the 
insufficient receipts to the state treasury, is being financed 
only allowing for the available resources of the state budget. 
The financial status of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remains 
extraordinarily difficult and critical under those conditions. 
The troops were financed in 13 increments in November alone. 
  But even these crumbs actually arrived at the recipients 
through the banks only after delays of up to two weeks. The 
National Bank made the decision back in July to strengthen 
monitoring of the trustworthiness of bank documents. Wire 
receipts of monetary sums (and that is how we send them to the 
troops for the sake of speed) were to be confirmed by the payer 
bank therein, and the funds transferred to the military units 
only after the receipt of the appropriate confirmation. There 
are cases where there have been good profits from dishonest 
transactions. 
  All of this has led to the fact that the servicemen and 
employees of the armed forces were paid late at some garrisons 
for October--November. And it will be even harder to provide 
people with the money they are due for December with this sort 
of financing for the armed forces. This is intolerable. The 
servicemen and employees should receive everything due to them 
on time and in full. 
  I do not want to be less than straightforward. There are no 
funds to pay for food, fuels and lubricants, or municipal and 
other services, owing to which a number of military compounds 
have been cut off from sources of everyday support. The 
employees of the military repair enterprises, whom we are unable 
to pay for repairs performed on hardware and military property, 
are at the brink of a social explosion along with the military 
units. 
  The command of the military districts and branches of the 
armed forces, the chiefs of garrisons, units commanders and 
certain subunits, entirely naturally, are also appealing 
personally to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and to the 
Finance Directorate to rectify the situation as soon as 
possible, and provide temporary financial assistance in this 
truly hopeless situation. 
  It must be stated that both the Ministry of Defense of 
Ukraine and the Finance Directorate are well aware of the 
situation that has resulted. Everything possible is being done 
to eliminate the tensions in the military collectives, and to 
instill order in monetary support for the servicemen and 
employees of the armed forces. The Minister of Defense of 
Ukraine has personally met with the highest leaders of the state 
several times, and appeals have been sent over his signature to 
the President of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, 
the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine and the chairman of the 
board of the National Bank of Ukraine setting forth the 
situation that has taken shape with financing for the armed 
forces, and warning of the rise in social tensions among the 
military and civilian collectives. 
  The commanders of units, the socio-psychological service and 
the finance bodies are exerting a great deal of effort to 
explain to servicemen that this is a temporary difficulty, but 
the measures that are being implemented are not finding 
understanding among the personnel, since the situation is 
repeated every month. Many servicemen are filing requests for 
discharge from the armed forces, since they cannot provide for 
their families. Not to mention those without apartments, who are 
unable to pay for their temporary spots. 
  As bitter as it may be to read these telegrams, what can you 
do--they are the truth. I repeat once again that the Ministry of 
Defense is doing everything possible to ease the situation with 
the financing for the troops. It must be frankly stated that the 
ministry has no money. Everything that is received from the 
State Budget is sent to its recipients immediately. 
  The president and government of Ukraine, despite the 
difficult economic situation in the country, have made a very 
important and vitally necessary decision pertaining to the 
social protection of servicemen and the members of their 
families--to provide food rations for the servicemen of the 
armed forces and their military formations created in accordance 
with legislation, starting on 1 October of this year. And that 
is good support for the families of servicemen in today's 
difficult situation. 
  The pay for servicemen has been tripled overall starting 1 
December. That is now the fourth increase this year. 
  There is thus no reason to lose faith in improvements in the 
situation, both in Ukraine as a whole and in the armed forces in 
particular. We are relying on the fact that the state will not 
leave its defenders without assistance in this difficult time 
for all the people, the more so as we are receiving proper 
support on most issues from the president, the government and 
the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine.

meeting with journalists by Chief of the General Staff of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine and First Deputy Minister of Defense of 
Ukraine Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata: "Building a Strong Army 
is Difficult Without Money and Harmony"] 
  [Text] Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces 
of Ukraine and First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine 
Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata met with the editors of a number 
of the central newspapers of Ukraine, as well as the creative 
staffs of radio and television. In the course of a more than 
two-hour discussion, Anatoliy Vasylovych related some of the 
results in building the armed forces and the problems and 
difficulties of this difficult matter, and answered a host of 
questions. 
  NARODNA ARMIYA has already introduced Colonel-General 
Anatoliy Lopata to its readers, and there is probably no need to 
present his biography again. We will nonetheless emphasize once 
again that Anatoliy Vasylovych linked his life with the army 
some thirty five years ago. After completing general military 
school, he served as commander of a platoon, company and 
battalion, chief of staff, regimental commander, deputy division 
commander, commander of a division, a corps and first deputy 
commander of a group of forces. He has completed two military 
academies--imeni M.V. Frunze and the General Staff. 
  It was not easy for Anatoliy Vasylovych to make the time for 
the meeting with journalists on this day. He nevertheless found 
an hour or two for the conversation with us. Thanking us for the 
attention that the employees of the press, radio and television 
have devoted to the armed forces and their problems, he stated 
that the main result of the two years of building the army is 
the fact that independent Ukraine has its own army. That is 
first. Second, we have the opportunity to look back today and 
analyze what has been done and what has not, and on that basis 
to define more concrete ways of realizing the program of 
military organizational development. The level of leadership of 
the armed forces today, and first of all the activity of the 
General Staff in this area, has become much higher. And it is 
there that I see the consequences of the work of my subordinates. 
  Third, we have finally clarified the status of the armed 
forces staff. Today it has the name of the General Staff of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine. And that is no small feat. 
  Fourth, we are building our army today on a quite solid 
legal 
foundation. I have in mind here the laws "The Defense of 
Ukraine," "The Armed Forces of Ukraine," and the Military 
Doctrine, which was recently adopted by our parliament, along 
with other legislation. 
  I would also like to say something about this. Our cadres 
today--the officers, warrant officers, NCOs and soldiers--are 
people who have clearly answered the question of whom they are 
serving and how they are serving. We have been lucky to preserve 
the combat readiness of our troops at a level that guarantees 
the reliable defense of the peaceful labor of the people of 
Ukraine under difficult conditions. And that is convincingly 
testified by the results of the recent performance evaluations 
for the past training year. 
  Unfortunately, Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata continued, 
there are shortcomings and mistakes in our work. In the past 
year, for example, we were not fortunate enough to fulfill 
entirely the program relating to the training of units and 
subunits. Why, you ask? There is one reason--not enough 
mat&eacute;riel or funds. We had to cut back the training time of 
flight personnel in aviation units, say, owing to the acute 
shortage of fuels and lubricants, and we were not able to 
conduct regimental tactical exercises in the full amount with 
the use of vehicles and other means on which the professional 
proficiency of the commanders and their subordinates depends to 
a considerable extent. 
  Consider this: It has been estimated that for an army to 
fulfill the tasks entrusted to it successfully requires 
somewhere around 3.6 percent of the gross national income for 
its maintenance and development. This is the ideal--that is, if 
the state already has well-formed statehood and developed armed 
forces. Ukraine is still on its way to that. So everything being 
supplied to the army today is not sufficient. The armed forces, 
for example, were allocated just a third of the amount we needed 
last year, and even less if the uncontrolled inflation is taken 
into account. The financial inflows, in short, are barely enough 
to feed and clothe the people and pay them. There is simply 
nothing left for the rest. 
  There is also no money, most unfortunately, to supplement 
the 
inventory of combat vehicles, or for the development and 
manufacture of more effective models of weaponry. What has and 
will the army live on? To a significant extent on the former 
reserves of logistical mat&eacute;riel and military property. The 
reserves, meanwhile, if they are not replenished, will be 
exhausted sooner or later. As for the money, Minfin [Ministry of 
Finance] is also seeking out opportunities and passing them on 
each month for the needs of the armed forces. But the officers, 
warrant officers, workers and employees are nonetheless 
receiving their pay late these days. This, in turn, is having a 
negative effect on their attitude toward the work and the 
well-being of their families. It is especially difficult for 
those who reside in remote garrisons where there are not always 
kindergartens, schools, stores, or bus lines with the closest 
inhabited areas. Whatever one may say, everything is not as 
simple as it could seem to some. 
  The state and the MO [Ministry of Defense] are nonetheless 
doing a great deal to ease the lives of servicemen and the 
members of their families. The question of issuing food rations 
to officers and warrant officers was positively resolved 
recently in particular, as well as cigarettes for soldiers and 
NCOs. There is no doubt that the issues that have acutely faced 
the people in uniform will also find understanding in the 
government. 
  We return, however, to the problems connected with the 
renewal of hardware and weaponry. I would not be surprised if 
some of you were to ask me how it could have happened that we 
have such a mighty defense industry as ours, but the army today 
is still using what it got from the once-mighty and 
"indivisible"? We really did get a mighty scientific and 
industrial potential after the collapse of the Union. It must be 
said that the armed forces themselves have a solid production 
base--there are several dozen repair plants alone. But they, 
like the enterprises of the military-industrial complex, are in 
a difficult situation today. Quite a few of them, owing to the 
absence of funds in the Ministry of Defense for the procurement 
of hardware and weaponry and their repairs, as well as the 
ordering of new models of weaponry, have been forced to seek out 
ways that would permit them to at least make ends meet in these 
difficult times. 
  The problem of military science, without which the army 
cannot manage, is no less acute. Everything would appear to be 
understandable here. But what is actually happening? Just a 
hundredth of what is required has been invested in the 
development of military science today. A great deal of 
scientific work has been curtailed owing to the lack of 
finances. We have considerable scientific potential at the same 
time. It just needs to be preserved and strengthened with 
funding. The need, however, does not always match the 
capabilities. The Ministry of Defense is losing excellent cadres 
of scientific personnel, who will scarcely be coming back in the 
future, as a consequence. 
  Other difficulties being experienced by the army could be 
cited as well, said Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata. But it will 
live on nonetheless, and take on new forms and outlines. I am an 
optimist by nature, so if you ask me what I would like to see 
for our armed forces in the future, then I would answer without 
reflection--to be respected by the people and the state. How can 
that be achieved? There is certainly no unequivocal answer to 
that question, as it is complex and multifaceted. And 
nonetheless, it seems to me, many of these problems could recede 
by themselves if we are able to raise the prestige of military 
service and the prestige of the military person in society. So 
once again, how? You will not achieve anything here by 
punishment or some willful decisions, and could even make 
matters worse. Let us make a small excursion into the recent 
past in order to understand and look into the reasons for the 
decline in prestige of military service. 
  More or less better conditions have been created for people 
in the spheres of trade, business and entrepreneurship over the 
last five or six years or so. That has had an immediate effect 
on the armed forces. Military cadres, and not the worst of them, 
began to flow out of the ranks. This process was not halted 
after Ukraine began to build its own army. I do not want to say 
that business and trade are not needed by our society. But 
without reliable people devoted to their homeland serving in the 
army, we cannot talk about a strong state. I would like to see, 
that is, intelligent youth loyal to their Fatherland come to us. 
  I also touched at the beginning of our discussion on the 
problem of financing the army. I would like to see our armed 
forces have a budget that would be sufficient not only for their 
maintenance, the training of personnel and the upkeep of 
hardware in combat-ready condition, but also for the development 
of military science, the creation of new models of hardware and 
weaponry etc. Only in that case will our troops be engaged in 
what they should be, that is, raising the level of their combat 
readiness. But one can only think about that now; time does not 
wait. And that is where this could lead. 
  I will refer as an example to a problem connected with the 
development and creation of our hardware and weaponry. 
  Everything our army is equipped with today is hardware and 
weaponry of the former Soviet Army, which is, by the way, not 
eternal and has entirely concrete service lives. A completely 
new tank, say, can be operated for a span of fifteen or twenty 
years. The vehicle is obsolete upon the expiration of that 
period, and it must be replaced. Financing is needed today, in 
order to place an order for a new model of weaponry, for 
scientific development, and then for the manufacture of the 
vehicles at enterprises in the military-industrial complex. 
Taking into account the fact that the average time period for 
the birth of a new model of a weapon, depending on the 
complexity of the work, is seven to fifteen years, one may say 
that if money is not invested in the development of weapons 
today, then in seven or fifteen years we will not have them. 
  It would not be quite correct to say that no one understands 
the ruinous nature of this situation. Ask any of our workers and 
you will be convinced of that. The understanding is possibly 
worse at higher levels. If, say, we want to get our finances in 
order, then people appear who will say that perhaps we could 
wait for the future for our armed forces, and let them survive 
through the reserves that they have. But everything that used to 
be in the army is coming to an end today. It has actually 
already lived and maintained its combat readiness for two years 
thanks to internal reserves. Today we need to think seriously 
about the future of the armed forces, that is, about their 
further improvement and development. And in all of this we have 
still not said anything about the accumulation of material 
resources and reserves for difficult times. 
  Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata emphasized, in answering a 
question regarding what the ideology will be in the army, that 
the leadership of the armed forces is doing everything to see 
that it has one, uniform ideology--the state ideology. To put it 
in more concrete terms, then we will try first and foremost to 
see that every serviceman--officer or warrant officer, sergeant 
or soldier--is a citizen of his Fatherland, and that his level 
of training and readiness would permit him to fulfill his 
patriotic duties to defend the independent Ukraine with honor. 
That is first. Second, I also see my task as seeing that there 
is unity, harmony and understanding of their tasks among the 
servicemen with regard to the security of our state. Avoiding 
discord in the thoughts of soldiers, sergeants and officers is 
facilitated to no small extent by the work to avert the 
influence of political parties and movements on the military 
collectives. It is no secret that such influence exists in 
Ukraine. I would like to remind them once again that our army is 
not needed for political battles, it is needed for the 
protection of the interests of the state and its land, sea and 
air borders, and for the maintenance of peace and harmony in 
society. And there are not, and cannot be, even the slightest 
actions here by those who have quite different aims and 
interests. 
  With a view to continuing the discussion of this topic, the 
chief of the General Staff was asked a question regarding the 
political situation in Sevastopol and, in particular, the 
motives for the recent murder of the chief of the press center 
of the Black Sea Fleet, Captain 1st Rank A. Lazebnykov. That 
city, said Anatoliy Vasylovych, is becoming a tangled knot of 
political problems and many unresolved issues pertaining to the 
further existence and presence of the ChF [Black Sea Fleet] on 
our land. As for the murder of the head of the press center, 
neither the armed forces nor the Ukrainian Navy have any 
relation to that whatsoever. The opinion of the chief of the 
General Staff is that there were no political motives at all at 
the heart of that tragic incident, the more so any of the 
conflicts that existed at one time between the sailors of the 
ChF and the Ukrainian Navy. Something else is concealed here. 
  The journalists were also unable to avoid asking about some 
of their own problems at this meeting. The discussion concerned 
in particular the fact that it has become more difficult for the 
members of the press to obtain information pertaining to 
military topics, and whether that was connected with any 
prohibitions. That is in reality not so. The armed forces of 
Ukraine, emphasized the chief of the General Staff, have never 
been closed to the mass media. But here is something to worry 
about. Quite a few commentators have appeared here recently who 
are, without any authority or rights whatsoever, sharing with 
this or that correspondent their ideas pertaining to this or 
that factor or incident, and are frequently passing that off as 
the stance of the Ministry of Defense. I, said Colonel-General 
Anatoliy Lopata, am categorically against that treatment of the 
issue. If we want to tell our people about the life of the 
military collectives, then we should turn to the people who know 
what they are talking about, what the essence of the problem is. 
Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to confirm 
once again what I have said many times before: Ask our 
specialists, ask me, ask our chiefs of directorates any question 
at any time if you please, and no one will fail to inform you of 
anything. By the way, we will never close the gates of a unit to 
journalists, we will not conceal problems from them connected 
with non-regulation relations, with desertion from the army. In 
confirmation of what he said, Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata 
related in quite a bit of detail how many of our servicemen are 
on the run today, and what reasons prompted them to take such a 
step. There are currently fifty-three soldiers "on the run" in 
the Carpathian region, for example. The motives that impelled 
them to leave their military collectives are very diverse. The 
people left their units, however, as a rule not because they 
were beaten or driven from them, but rather because many of them 
are simply not ready to bear all of the difficulties of military 
service in a steadfast manner. 
  The army is not able to solve this problem alone. It exists, 
one might say, at the boundary of military and civilian 
activity. Much here depends on the schools, parents and labor 
collectives, and on their work with regard to the patriotic 
indoctrination of the pre-draft youth. 
  Seeing alternative service as one realistic way of restoring 
the situation in the military collectives, the journalists were 
interested in hearing from the chief of the General Staff how 
the call-up for that service was proceeding, what difficulties 
are arising. Reminding them of some of the provisions of the Law 
of Ukraine "Alternative (Extra-Military) Service," 
Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata observed, not without regret, 
that hundreds of youth who have expressed the desire to work, 
for example, in construction or at treatment centers, hospitals 
or other places are not being called. Some fear the longer term 
of service, others are unaware, and still others... There is, in 
short, much here to think about and work on. 
  The discussion next turned to national problems and, in 
particular, what the composition of the army will be. In 
accordance with the principles of military organizational 
development, said Anatoliy Vasylovych, the armed forces of 
Ukraine have to be popular rather than national. I like the name 
of our newspaper NARODNA ARMIYA on that plane. The people 
[narod] are a union of many peoples and 
nationalities. Look how many there are in our country. Living 
here, aside from the Ukrainians, are Russians, Belarusians, 
Moldovans, Poles, Germans... 
  Why am I talking about this? Because if we want there to be 
peace and harmony in our independent state, then it is very 
important to have a well-disposed and understanding attitude 
toward each person, no matter what nationality he may be. The 
fact that each member of society is passionate about Ukraine and 
defends its independence is no less important in turn. And if 
that is so, then he is obliged to enjoy all the same rights as 
Ukrainians. There will otherwise not be harmony in society, and 
the state will not have a mighty and combat-ready army. 
  At the end of the meeting the journalists were interested in 
the thoughts of the chief of the General Staff on the nuclear 
weapons that are located on the territory of our state, ways and 
options for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, the procedure for 
the transfer and future use of of military compounds after the 
disbanding of military units in the strategic forces and a great 
deal more. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, answering all of the 
questions clearly and exhaustively, appealed to the journalists 
with the request and wish to be very considerate and delicate 
with regard to covering the life and activity of the armed 
forces, and called for objective writing on current event and 
more vigorous and purposeful work in favor of the army, to 
strengthen its reputation and raise combat and mobilization 
readiness.
