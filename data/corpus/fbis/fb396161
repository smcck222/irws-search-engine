<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Mykola Vasylkevych, head of the Lvov </F>
Oblast organization of Ukraine's Officers Union [SOU], by Mariya 
Bazelyuk; place and date not given: "Ukraine's Military 
Doctrine Rules Out Full Unilateral Disarmament"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's Officers Union has always occupied a 
firm position defending our state independence. It took an 
active part in creating Ukraine's Armed Forces, and later -- in 
their building. Here is an interview with Colonel Mykola 
Vasylkevych, head of the Lvov Oblast organization of Ukraine's 
Officers Union. 
  [Bazelyuk] Colonel, it is believed that servicemen are not 
supposed to engage in politics, something for which SOU has 
frequently been criticized. However, how can one remain outside 
political life when questions of the military doctrine, the 
Black Sea Fleet, or Ukraine's nuclear disarmament are being 
resolved? 
  [Vasylkevych] Quite true, servicemen are not allowed to take 
part in the activity of political parties, however, this should 
not be confused with the work of public organizations, such as 
Ukraine's Officers Union or with the participation in 
state-building processes in general. Article 4 of the law "On 
Associations of Citizens" forbids the creation of political 
parties within the Armed Forces. However, Article 6 of the 
provisional Statutes of the Internal Service reads that 
servicemen have all socioeconomic, political, and personal 
rights. The creation of the Armed Forces is politics. From the 
very first days of our state's existence, patriotically minded 
Ukrainian officers and generals began to elaborate legislative 
documents on the Armed Forces. For example, Colonel Vitaliy 
Lazorkin, jointly with a group of officers, elaborated at least 
two variants of the military doctrine that were published in the 
press. General Oleksandr Rol, the present head of Ukraine's 
Officers Union, proposed his own variant of the military 
doctrine. Incidentally, Oleksandr Rol has been registered as a 
candidate for [Supreme Council] deputy at Halych Electoral 
District No. 260. 
  [Bazelyuk] What is the character of Ukraine's military 
doctrine? 
  [Vasylkevych] To begin with, it must be clearly understood 
that the military doctrine is a system of views of the possible 
character of a war, preparation of the country for war, military 
building, and comprehensive provision of the Armed Forces. It 
has three subdivisions: the military-political, 
military-technological, and military-economic aspects. As a 
matter of fact, servicemen may only take part in the elaboration 
of the military-technological aspect, whereas the other two are 
the prerogative of the Supreme Council and of the Cabinet of 
Ministers. 
  Ukraine's strategic tasks in the defense sphere comprise the 
defense of its state sovereignty, political independence, and 
territorial integrity. In other words, the military doctrine 
has a defensive character. 
  [Bazelyuk] In that case, how can one account for the 
presence on our territory of the 43d Missile Army, which has 
not, to this day, sworn allegiance to Ukraine? 
  [Vasylkevych] In the past, Ukraine's Defense Minister issued 
an order, in accordance with which all those military units and 
subunits that are in charge of storage and use of nuclear 
munitions, were included into the 43d Missile Army, whose 
command is subordinated to the Ukrainian military department. 
Therefore, they were supposed to take the oath, something upon 
which SOU insisted during meetings with former Defense Minister 
General Kostyantyn Morozov. All the more so, since it was 
found, during the meeting in Vinnytsya with officers of the 
Missile Army and from opinion polls, that 80 percent of officers 
and warrant officers in the 43d army wish to take the oath. 
Now, that the military doctrine has become a state document, 
all those who serve in Ukraine must take the oath. 
  [Bazelyuk] Ukraine, which, in accordance with the military 
doctrine, rules out full unilateral disarmament, is today giving 
away its nuclear weapons, Why do you think such metamorphoses 
are taking place in our country? 
  [Vasylkevych] The military doctrine specifically states 
that, in the future, Ukraine intends to become a nonnuclear 
state and that it links the destruction of nuclear weapons with 
identical actions on the part of other nuclear powers. It has 
recently been stated quite frequently that nuclear weapons may 
become a great misfortune for Ukraine. There is some truth in 
this. For example, the SS-19 missiles deployed in Ukraine were 
manufactured at Moscow plants, and some missile warheads are 
also of Russian manufacture; it is true that, in 1994, the 
warranted service life of some of them is due to expire and, in 
this connection, certain difficulties may arise. However, SS-24 
missiles for example, were manufactured at our own Ukrainian 
plants, and one does not have to be a great strategist to 
understand that they may be reprogrammed for a shorter range of 
action. If we do, after all, give up our nuclear potential 
(which, to me, seems too generous), then, after the warranted 
service life of nuclear charges expires, the SS-24 missiles may 
be converted into missiles with conventional warheads. 
  [Bazelyuk] However, there are demands that we urgently 
transfer them to Russia, because we need fuel for our atomic 
electric power plants [AES's]. 
  [Vasylkevych] You know, even though I am not a specialist in 
this sphere, I am certain that Ukraine extracts uranium ores and 
even has facilities to enrich them to the concentration of 0.7, 
however, having enriched them to that level, for some reason, it 
ships them to Russia, where they are brought up to the necessary 
concentration, following which only some of them return to 
Ukraine in the form of fuel for our AES's. This was stipulated 
well in advance, but I am far from believing that Ukraine is 
unable to resolve the problem of the complete enrichment of 
uranium ores. 
  [Bazelyuk] It is maintained that we do not have military 
specialists at the level that may work with nuclear and space 
weapons. If so, why can they not be trained? 
  [Vasylkevych] In the past, there were more than 30 higher 
military educational institutions and a number of research 
institutes on the territory of Ukraine. I can say with 
certainty that there are military specialists in Ukraine who 
have taken and continue to take part in the development of the 
most up-to-date military technology and weapons. It is a 
different matter that the reform of military education was not 
conducted properly, and today we need cadres that are capable of 
commanding formations, armies, and so on. As has become known 
to us, the minister of defense has taken upon himself the 
personal control of the Administration for Military Education, 
having replaced its leadership. Even today, Ukraine's Armed 
Forces have enough specialists capable of training highly 
qualified personnel to service advanced military technology.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Litvinova, IZVESTIYA: "The Latvian Army: </F>
`Green Beret' Experience Plus Soviet Training"] 
  [Text] The security of the state is becoming a priority for 
the government; Prime Minister of Latvia Valdis Birkavs has 
stated so. It has been announced that defense expenditures will 
be increased, despite the runaway budget deficit. 
  Latvian military men are happy: So far the organizational 
development of the Armed Forces has been sputtering for strictly 
financial reasons. To be sure, helpers have come along. Germany 
sent the uniforms of the former GDR Army, a little bit of 
materiel, and naval cutters. This country is paying a great deal 
attention to the Latvian Army. The German military attache has 
handed a present to Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis 
Pavlovskis--two sets of high-grade video and audio equipment 
which are used in the conduct of military inspections. Experts 
from Paris have visited in order to learn what assistance France 
could provide. Riga requested assistance on the issues of 
communication, transportation, military medicine, the Navy, and 
other spheres. Military instructors who have trained Latvian 
"Zemessardze" ("militiamen") have come from Great Britain. The 
Minister of Defense of Belgium has offered army materiel, 
weapons, and other resources released as a result of reductions 
in the Armed Forces of Belgium. Finally, the Swedes and the 
Danes have provided continuous assistance: this includes 
consultations, materiel, and monetary subsidies. The Americans 
are sympathetic: a military delegation has just visited Latvia. 
  In the words of Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis 
Pavlovskis, a report has been submitted to the National Defense 
Council analyzing where a military threat to Latvia may 
originate. The content of the report is not yet known. 
Meanwhile, newspapers have been writing about Russia in a harsh 
tone, shaping their own concept of a possible threat and 
potential enemy. 
  According to the Constitution, President Guntis Ulmanis, 
Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Forces of Latvia, also heads 
the National Security Council. But, of course, the Ministry of 
Defense plays first fiddle. Latvian military commanders in the 
upper echelon combine the experience of "green berets" and 
participation in the war in Afghanistan; at issue are both the 
Minister of Defense and the Commander of the Defense Forces. 
  Current Minister of Defense Valdis Pavlovskis (who turns 60 
this year) is a civilian. However, he has decent combat 
experience: He reached the rank of Captain in the U.S. Marines. 
He commanded a "green beret" unit in Vietnam. As he told 
journalists, he "taught guerrilla tactics" at an officer academy 
in the United States. 
  Valdis Pavlovskis speaks Latvian with a slight accent: He 
was 
born in Riga, but spent his entire life in emigration. 
Pavlovskis was active in organizations coming out against the 
occupation of Latvia by Soviet troops. He returned to the 
Republic during the national rennaissance period and soon took 
the position of deputy of Talavs Jundzis, the first Minister of 
Defense of independent Latvia. Jundzis, one of the activists of 
the People's Front, now heads the Baltic Center for Strategic 
Research. Valdis Pavlovskis was elected a Deputy in elections to 
the Saeima [parliament] this summer on the ticket of the 
governing party The Latvian Way. 
  In an interview Pavlovskis complained that Balts abroad have 
had to make a great effort to explain to the world why the 
governments of Baltic countries did not even try to offer 
resistance to the Red Army in 1940. In the words of the Minister 
of Defense, if something similar recurs, we need to show to the 
world: we are capable of fighting for our freedom. Commander of 
the Defense Forces Dainis Turlais voiced a similar point of view 
during a conference: "Our main task is to protect the country 
against an aggressor at least for a few days so that the public 
of the world and its organizations will be able to respond to 
the conflict." 
  The order discharging Colonel Dainis Turlais from the Soviet 
Army was signed by Marshal Shaposhnikov. Turlais, the former 
Chief of the Operations Section of the 40th Army (he fought in 
Afghanistan for three years), gave up a promising career in 
Russia, discontinued studies at the General Staff Academy, and 
returned to Latvia to build its armed forces. Dainis Turlais is 
43; he is energetic. The new, old-style Latvian uniform fits him 
like a glove. In Turlais's opinion, the Defense Forces of Latvia 
should consist of 10,000 people. Attention should be focused on 
border guard formations. Rifle battalions within the country 
should assist them if necessary. However, the security concept 
and the defense plan which is now being developed will still 
change because literally the last few weeks have compelled many 
changes in the concepts of the Latvian military, who are 
inspired by the support of NATO specialists. 
  For now, Latvian military cadres are being trained mainly 
within the Republic. The Academy of National Defense of Latvia 
is housed on the premises of the School imeni Biryuzov, one of 
the best in the former Union. The academy is headed by Valdis 
Matiss, likewise a former colonel of the Soviet Army: He headed 
a department at the Frunze Academy. The current military attache 
of Latvia in Russia, Gunars Alksnis, headed a Department of 
instruction at the same academy. Tactical intelligence is his 
specialty. Latvian officers are also invited to study abroad, 
but poor knowledge of foreign languages is an obstacle. 
Incidentally, the language problem also surfaced during joint 
exercises of the defense forces of the three Baltic states: In 
what language are commands to be given so that everybody would 
understand--not in the Russian language of occupation, really? 
The Minister of Defense of Latvia ordered that the system of 
commands and organization of communications adopted in NATO be 
mastered this year. 
  Only citizens of Latvia are drafted for service in its armed 
forces. However, some are not in a hurry to do their patriotic 
duty. They evade the daily round of the army and desert their 
units. Drinking and dedovshchina are flourishing. They have 
already become the reason for fatal accidents. Here, two border 
guards shot each other; there, a young guardian of the border, 
after firing at his comrade, went further away from the post and 
shot himself. The taunting of new recruits in a convoy regiment 
ended in tragedy: young soldiers driven to despair by outrages 
in the unit decided to flee. Three Latvian boys tried to cross 
the border in order to hide out in Russia, but the Latvian 
border guards apprehended them. Some junior commanders were 
relieved from their positions following an inquiry. Incidents in 
the Defense Forces are dwarfed by the "glory" of the dashing 
"Zemessardze": loss of weapons, murders, drunken disorderliness. 
The "Zemessardze" are a peculiar structure. "Patriots make up 
the militia"--this is how Girts Kristovskis, recently Militia 
Chief of Staff (currently Minister of Internal Affairs) 
characterized his comrades. Activists of the People's Front and 
more radical organizations of that time became "Zemessardze." 
The trouble is that patriotism is no substitute for training and 
discipline. For a long time members of the militia in spotted 
camouflage smacked of "Makhno's guys" possessed by the 
national-patriotic idea. To be sure, attempts have been recently 
made to give them a more or less civilized appearance. At any 
rate, there are fewer scandals associated with these people, who 
are armed and very dangerous. Evaluating the year 1993 in an 
interview to the newspaper DIENA, the Minister of Defense 
observed: "The relationship between the Defense Forces and the 
militia has improved perceptibly. It is now much easier to find 
a common language to achieve common objectives." Latvia was the 
first among the republics of the former Union to introduce 
alternative service, but soon gave it up. It was ineffective, 
and control was lacking. Labor service was introduced, but it is 
virtually defunct, too. There is unemployment in the state, and 
those who draw benefits for months do not have enough slots to 
use their energies. The Ministry of Defense has developed new 
rules for induction into the military service: It is envisioned 
reducing the number of categories of individuals ineligible for 
the draft. However, the plan is to reduce the duration of 
service to one year, with the exception of those who will have 
to master advanced materiel. 
  How many soldiers are there in the Latvian Army? According 
to 
data from the newspaper NEATKARIGA CINA, at present the Defense 
Forces have 1,500 soldiers and 150 officers. Six hundred 
soldiers and 30 officers serve in the naval forces. At the 
border, 338,000 [as published] soldiers and 340 officers are in 
the service. The Navy consists of 15 vessels (nine are at full 
readiness). The Air Force has two An-2 planes and two L-410's 
(one is in operation). There are six helicopters. The Latvian 
Army has to date been using mainly former Soviet weapons. A 
batch of Czech assault rifles has been purchased. Head of the 
Cabinet of Ministers Valdis Birkavs stated that Latvia, like 
Estonia, intends to buy weapons from Israel. 
  Since the beginning of the year the armed forces of the 
three 
Baltic states have noticeably stepped up coordination of their 
actions. Preparations are underway for joint exercises of rifle 
companies; in February they will be held in Estonia, in July--in 
Lithuania, and in October--in Latvia. As Chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Commission Aleksandrs Kirsteins said, pooling their 
efforts will make it possible for the Baltic states to create a 
powerful echelon of defense against a potential aggressor.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents Captains 1st Rank </F>
Vladimir Urban and Valeriy Gromak, under the rubric: "Military 
Review":"`If We Can Just Hold Out for Another Year' -- After 
That the Baltic Countries Hope To Form a Military Alliance"] 
  [Text] All military alliances are similar to each 
other. And perhaps the only question to which the answers will 
be different is: "Why is the bloc being created?" Literally a 
year from now we will become witnesses to the birth of a new 
alliance -- the Baltic Alliance. And this is not a prediction 
but a visible prospect. So, this question is already 
appropriate: "Why?" 
<H6>  We Have Sent A Note to NATO </H6>
  As had been anticipated, a sensation due to Lithuania's 
entry 
into NATO did not occur. But President Algirdas Brazauskas' 
official request, which was sent to the North Atlantic 
Organization at the beginning of this year, once again confirmed 
the strategic goals not only of that country but also of the 
Baltic states as a whole. 
  In the middle of December, the general opinion that only 
NATO 
is capable of guaranteeing the security of the Baltic republics 
was expressed at a meeting in Tallinn of the three presidents -- 
Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis and Lennart Meri. It is 
erroneous to think that these conclusions were arrived at under 
the influence of the "Zhironovskiy factor" in the Russian 
parliamentary elections. We think that this is only a reason for 
the outcome because, in a joint statement on the meeting's 
results, even the presidents stressed that attempts for a 
rapprochement with NATO arose, not under the influence of the 
elections in Russia, but because the Baltic countries have 
already been long interested "in closer ties" with that military 
bloc. 
  It is characteristic that last summer and autumn we saw in 
local politics the banner of the creation of a regional security 
system. And the priorities of cooperation began to be seen more 
clearly as winter approached. 
  At a meeting of the armed forces (defense forces) 
Commanders-in-Chief of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and this 
was in October, it was announced for the first time that the 
Baltic states need their own "Baltic NATO". And the need to 
create a "unified Baltic countries military system according to 
the NATO type" was officially confirmed already at the prime 
ministers December meeting. 
  According to certain data, they plan to sign a 
comprehensive treaty on a defensive alliance already at the end 
of this year, immediately after, as they think here, the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia. And during 
the time remaining they propose developing a package of specific 
agreements in the military sphere which will help to immediately 
begin the realization of the main treaty. 
  Now obviously the time has come to answer the question: "Why 
is the new bloc being created?" Lithuanian Minister of National 
Defense Linas Linkyavichyus expressed that most frankly when he 
said in a national television interview that the Baltic 
countries "should not knock at the door of the collective 
security system with their hands extended" but that they need to 
have their own effective military structures which will then be 
added to NATO. 
<H6>  One Battalion Is Already Standing Roll Call </H6>
  What documents already exist? The Lithuanian Ministry of 
National Defense had already prepared one of the drafts of the 
treaty on military cooperation during the summer and it was sent 
to the Latvian and Estonian ministries of defense. It provides 
for the creation of a unified air defense system, joint 
protection of ground and maritime borders, and the exchange of 
operational information. Furthermore, it is considered advisable 
to have a common training facility to train troops and a Baltic 
arms development and production program. 
  For now we know that on the whole the Lithuanian draft was 
supported by its neighbors. They decided to create a "hot line" 
between the three ministers of defense and to exchange military 
attaches as "operational measures", and they also planned to 
strengthen the eastern borders in the near future. They plan to 
discuss these problems in more detail in January at the prime 
ministers meeting in Riga. 
  It is understandable that the development of military 
cooperation will primarily depend upon the level of 
"rapprochement of the politicians". Right now a working group 
has been created to develop the charter of the Baltic countries 
presidential council. (A statute on the Baltic Assembly, a 
distinctive Baltic parliament, has already been adopted 
--Authors' comment). Later, as usual, the creation of 
all of the vertical structures of the new alliance will begin. 
  Analysts agree that only the proposals on the organs of 
military command and control could cause serious disagreements. 
If you take the Lithuanian variant as a basis, you can hardly 
restrict yourself to the armed forces Commanders-in-Chiefs 
conference (council). A permanent organ in the form of a unified 
command authority will most likely be required. But even this 
diagram is not at all flawless. If, for example, you count on 
the entry of the Baltic republics into the North Atlantic 
Organization in the relatively near future, the organs of joint 
command and control that are being created will simply remain 
unnecessary. 
  Well for the time being the politicians have only begun to 
discuss the problems of a military alliance and the military 
personnel themselves have already taken part in the matter. The 
October commanders-in-chief meeting that was mentioned here made 
a joint decision on the creation of a "Baltic Battalion" by the 
end of 1994 which will then be placed at the disposal of UN 
peacekeeping forces. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008C-48A>           Diagram of One Possible Variant of the Future Alliance </FIG>


  They plan to deploy the battalion at Alitus 
(Lithuania). It will have a strength of 650 men. The structure: 
command structure, staff and three companies (Lithuanian, 
Latvian, and Estonian). A Lithuanian officer will become the 
commander, a Latvian officer will be deputy commander, and an 
Estonian officer will be chief of staff. The leadership and 
staff will be changed annually. They plan three exercises, an 
infantry company from each country will participate, in order to 
create the battalion this year. 
  But what if the UN does not require this battalion? Or if 
the 
leaders of the three countries do not decide on the 
participation of this subunit in peacekeeping operations? 
Estonian Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief Major-General 
Aleksander Eynseli thinks that even if the politicians do not 
determine their positions, the creation of the battalion will 
become "one more step toward the military cooperation of three 
countries". 
<H6>  But CNN Will Be the First To Arrive to Assist </H6>
  As we know, any military alliance assumes that armies are 
structured on approximately identical principles. But if Estonia 
has already begun the transition to NATO standards (it concluded 
a contract for the delivery of $50 million worth of Israeli arms 
-- small-arms and antitank weapons, light air defense systems, 
etc.), Latvia is counting primarily on "humanitarian weapons 
assistance" from Germany and Sweden, and for now Lithuania is 
oriented toward Russian arms. 
  In the future, Lithuania intends to resolve part of its 
own light weapons needs using its own resources. An experimental 
enterprise to produce military output ("Vityaz-2" 
machine-pistols, hand grenades, etc.) has been created based on 
Kaunas NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Construction and 
Architecture. Estonia plans to independently produce small-arms 
ammunition according to NATO standards. 
  There are differences in the organization of the armed 
forces 
and "standardization" must entail changes in legislation. Time 
will be required to do that. Enormous resources will have to be 
spent on the creation of an air defense system and on real air 
forces that are practically nonexistent right now. The budgets 
of all three countries are incapable of supporting these costs. 
  So, the new alliance's capabilities "to support defense" 
will 
not emerge from the purely political sphere for a long time yet. 
It is no accident that one Finnish analyst has noted without 
irony in this regard: "It would probably be more correct to 
characterize the current strategic doctrine of the Baltic states 
as defense oriented on CNN. The idea consists of the need to 
defend yourself... until the entire world is able to learn that 
you have been subjected to attack". 
  But you can rest assured that the Baltic states will not 
have 
to carry out this "dream". Indeed, the impression has formed 
that Latvia and Estonia are increasingly proceeding from 
Russia's allegedly inherent hostility toward them in their 
international policy. So one can anticipate that they will also 
begin to utilize the new alliance in order to present 
themselves, as before, as "hostages" of their Eastern neighbor. 
And then appeals will follow to fill the existing "security 
vacuum" with the assistance of the Western states. 
  As for Lithuania, while submitting a request for entry into 
NATO, it especially stipulated in advance that its desire is not 
directed against third countries. But even Baltic military 
integration, in which Lithuania has been quite definite, will 
inevitably affect the displacement of the Baltic region states' 
cooperation with the West in the military sphere. And this can 
already be considered to be a challenge to Russia. 
<H6>  The First Measures For the Creation of a Military Alliance: </H6>
  -- establishment of a "hot line" between the ministers of 
defense; 
  -- obligations to strengthen the states' eastern borders; 
  -- the exchange of military attaches; 
  -- the conduct of joint exercises (February 1994 -- on the 
territory of Estonia, July 1994 -- on the territory of 
Lithuania; October 1994 -- on the territory of Latvia) in the 
context of creating a unified "Baltic Battalion"; 
  -- monthly meetings of the heads of the main staffs (in the 
beginning of January 1994 in Tallinn, they discussed the 
specific problems of the formation of the "Baltic Battalion" and 
they will next meet on 14-15 February in Riga).

Abkhazia and Georgia flared up once again on the morning of 6 
February. Georgian troops opened artillery fire on positions of 
the Abkhazian armed forces. This was reported by the press 
service of the plenipotentiary of the Republic of Abkhazia in 
the Russian Federation. 
  At the same time bands from Georgian formations stepped up 
their activities in Galskiy Rayon. 
  In the meantime the press center of the Republic of 
Georgia's 
Ministry of Defense has issued its own assessment of the events. 
According to the Georgian side, under the pretext of combatting 
bands from the formations, Abkhazian formations numbering up to 
2,500 men are engaged in actions against the civilian population 
in the region, continuing their ethnic cleansing in the 
territory under their control. According to the same source, 
Georgia's government troops have not yet taken action in 
response. 
  The latest exacerbation of the situation has demonstrated 
once again that the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict cannot be 
resolved without a political settlement. Nor can one fail to 
consider the possibility that the events of 6 February could 
have been undertaken by forces on both sides of the Inguri which 
do not like the idea of establishing normal bilateral relations 
between Georgia and Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Baltic Fleet Vice-Admiral Viktor Kravchenko </F>
by Captain First Rank V. Gromak under the "Pressing" rubric; 
place and date not given: "Used Combat Ships Come Under the 
Hammer" -- first paragraph is KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA 
introduction; questions published in boldface] 
  [Text] The beginning of this year witnessed an auction of 
obsolete military assets -- one medium-sized warship and three 
smaller ones. I opened my conversation with Vice-Admiral Viktor 
Kravchenko, first Deputy Commander of the Baltic Fleet, with a 
question concerning this particular event. 
  [Kravchenko] In line with the decision of the Main 
Directorate for Material Resources at the Defense Ministry, the 
Baltic Fleet was allowed to hold a closed auction of outdated 
equipment -- one medium-sized and three smaller warships. Four 
firms participated in the auction. The initial bid increased by 
one-and-a-half times by the end of the auction. The three small 
ships were purchased by a St. Petersburg firm, which will break 
them up for scrap. The medium-sized warship was also sold to 
the St. Petersburg firm. After it is revamped in accordance 
with the requirements of the register, the medium-sized ship 
will acquire a second civilian life. 
  [Gromak] Viktor Andreyevich, how will the money that was 
raised be distributed? 
  [Kravchenko] Sixty percent of the money will be transferred 
to the Baltic Fleet Command's current account. This share will 
go toward the construction of military housing, while the 
remaining 40 percent -- to the Main Directorate for Material 
Resources at the Defense Ministry. 
  [Gromak] Who was allowed to participate in the auction? 
  [Kravchenko] All those who wished to do so. We had only one 
condition: To sell the ships on the domestic market alone. 
  [Gromak] Please tell us about the need to sell the fleet's 
property in the Baltic states, which has been going on for 
several years now. It is only now that we had the first event, 
but only as an experiment.... 
  [Kravchenko] We lost two years in selling all our obsolete 
ships. If the fleet commander had had permission (and there is 
no shortage of inspection bodies) to market all unnecessary and 
outdated hardware at prevailing prices for the region, we would 
have sold everything long ago. At the same time, we would not 
have requested a nickel from either the government or the 
Defense Ministry for the construction of housing for the troops 
and the fleet withdrawn from the Baltic states. Our estimates 
prove this. Until now, however, the Central Administration for 
Material Resources has held this issue in its fist, and the 
fleet has been permitted very little. Only some insignificant 
deals.... 
  [Gromak] As far as I know, the Main Directorate has its 
representatives in the Baltic states who engage in the sale of 
fleet property.... 
  [Kravchenko] Yes, it does. However, the situation in the 
Baltic states is paradoxical. Riga, Liepaja, Paldiski, Tallinn 
-- the Baltic Fleet will stay there for only four more months. 
A special representative for the sale of movable property was 
appointed by decree of the Russian Defense Minister last year. 
He arrived in August very eager to work. He promised to sell 
all the outdated ships in three-months time. Thus far, he has 
been selling them without success. Several contracts for the 
sale of certain vessels were concluded last year, but none of 
the ships were sold. The reason is that the prices determined by 
the Main Directorate for Material Resources were too high for 
this region. Now the Lieutenant-Colonel has concluded a deal for 
the sale of two used surface ships. I do not know, however, 
whether it will be accomplished. The representative is also 
negotiating the sale of all obsolete vessels in the Baltic 
states with a U.S. firm. Time flies, however. The fleet 
command has prepared a letter to Colonel-General Toporov, deputy 
Defense Minister, with its proposals and a request to make this 
process more dynamic....

<F P=106> ["Topical interview" with Gennadiy Voronin, chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation State Committee for Defense Sectors of 
Industry, by Vladimir Gundarov; date and place not given: 
"Russia's Naval Prestige Bound To Sink Below `Red' Line" -- 
first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Gennadiy Petrovich Voronin is an academician of the 
International Engineering Academy, a doctor of economical 
sciences, a member of the British Institute of Naval Engineers, 
an Honored Machine Builder of Russia, and a State Prize winner. 
He is Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee 
for Defense Sectors of Industry. 
  [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, you have devoted all your 
life to shipbuilding and you are well acquainted with all the 
stages of boom and decline in the Russian Navy's history. In 
your opinion, what kind of stage is it going through now? 
  [Voronin] A stage of decline, of course. It takes time to 
do what we have to do to overcome this stage in accordance with 
the new military doctrine -- with smaller numbers but higher 
quality, as the saying goes. But so far there has not been 
enough time for the Navy to acquire new qualities, that is for 
it to obtain new, high-precision weapons, more modern ships and 
command and control systems, and so on. Speaking in broad 
terms, we currently have no military equipment program, whereas 
in the past we had plans for 10-15 years in advance. 
  [Gundarov] Just how long do we still have to wait? 
  [Voronin] We have been waiting for a program for over 18 
months. It has now been finalized and signed, but it is not yet 
an official document which could be sent to our plants. I think 
it will be approved in the first quarter of this year. But the 
program is not dogma. Obviously it will still be subject to 
amendment, hopefully in the direction of increasing the fleet's 
combat strength. 
  [Gundarov] The press has repeatedly expressed the opinion 
that the current reduction in the number of Naval ships is the 
consequence not only of the USSR's geopolitical disintegration 
and the economic crisis in Russia, but also of mistakes made in 
drawing up the preceding shipbuilding programs.... 
  [Gundarov] Everything can be doubted and criticized with the 
benefit of hindsight. For example, many people say that we 
should not have built aircraft carriers; they say it was too 
expensive. But what is cheap? At that historical stage, given 
the military doctrine and given the confrontation with NATO and 
in particular with the United States, our shipbuilding program 
designed to take us through the year 2000 was, I believe, 
correct. It was elaborated and approved at collegiums of 
various ministries: Defense, Shipbuilding, and others. 
  I do not deny that mistakes are made in any business. We 
sometimes philosophize that everything should be decided 
collectively: By some kind of oblast committees, soviets, or 
collegiums. Nevertheless, the role of the individual will, I 
think, always influence specific decisions. Recently I went to 
America and England and saw how things are done there. There 
the role of the individual, judging by what happens, is simply 
staggering. Although outwardly it is less noticeable, maybe 
because everyone there has more freedom. 
  [Gundarov] We are now in Russia, where there have always 
been people with a preference for certain types of ship. So it 
would be interesting to find out which ships you have a 
preference for. 
  [Voronin] I have a preference for the Navy as a whole. I 
have carefully studied U.S. naval doctrine. By the year 2000 
their combat effectiveness will have increased 100 percent. Not 
through the number of ships but through the quality of new 
weapons and power-generating systems; in short, through science. 
Everything there is resolved in a comprehensive manner. At the 
same time it should be noted that many countries have decided to 
build small aircraft carriers designed to take 15-20 
Harrier-type aircraft. I believe that we too should have these 
aircraft carriers in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. They 
could be built in St. Petersburg or Severodvinsk. We have the 
ways on which to do that. 
  But I am concerned by what the Americans are doing now while 
we are doing nothing. We have started work to salvage old ships 
and submarines. While the United States is practically ceasing 
its involvement in salvaging and is converting old ships into 
training ships. A ship can be made ready for combat again 
within a month or two. 
  [Gundarov] Do you yourself believe that? 
  [Voronin] Generally it is hard to believe in something 100 
percent. But I know that the work is being done. I do not 
think that they will be able to convert all old ships into 
training ships, but here we often write off even quite new ships 
for scrap. 
  [Gundarov] For example, the aircraft carrying cruiser Kiev? 
  [Voronin] Its fate has still not been decided, but it is 
predetermined. 
  [Gundarov] Why can we not take the same road as the 
Americans? 
  [Voronin] We are probably prevented from doing so by a kind 
of "special Russian genotype." All the time we are trying to 
make economies without investing money in anything. In two 
years we have not built a single surface ship. But the problem 
of repairing old ships is not being solved either. So far, only 
the salvaging of submarines has been "stoked up" because 
ship-repair plants, which have no other orders at present, have 
clutched at this work like a straw. 
  [Gundarov] What is in store for the Navy in the near future? 
  [Voronin] We have worked out a program through 2003 in which 
we have taken account of the new military doctrine's demands. 
The program is based above all on the real situation in 
industry. Every plant has a so-called "red" technological line 
below which the plant must not go, in order to prevent the 
disintegration of production sectors. The illogical thing is 
that conversion has proceeded apace, that is, it has been 
several times greater than that originally planned. For 
example, we have enterprises where the main production decreased 
80 percent in one year. In this situation no economic formula 
works any more. That is why, when elaborating the economic 
program, we took as our basis the task of maintaining 
production. But even our minimal program, it turned out, costs 
four times as much as the budget available to the Defense 
Ministry. I know that the Defense Ministry is currently 
battling with the Finance and Economy Ministries. To avoid a 
total collapse we have been forced to take a risk: To put new 
systems, instruments, and units into production without having 
official documents for doing so. 
  [Gundarov] Are you not afraid that in five years or so 
people will at best start criticizing you for building ships 
without a program and therefore for making more mistakes? 
  [Voronin] There is something else that we have to fear: 
Being accused of doing nothing. After all, science cannot be 
stopped, but what we are doing is not essential. We know how 
and on what a potential enemy is working, how a process is 
proceeding throughout the world, and what new systems, component 
base, and new technologies are being developed. Of course, we 
too are compelled to carry out this work, but, it turns out, 
with our eyes shut. 
  [Gundarov] Still, is it not easier to work with our eyes 
open, even if on a minimal program? 
  [Voronin] I do not want to reveal all our secrets. I will 
merely note that an enterprise which has been able to get into a 
foreign market and make a dollar profit uses it not for its own 
social needs but for finding solutions to state tasks, including 
scientific developments. We are hard-put to compete with the 
Japanese, who already have the fifth generation of radio 
electronics in production -- molecular electronics and 
biocomputers. But should we not at least keep our finger on the 
pulse? Irrespective of whether the new parliament gives money 
or not. That is life. 
  [Gundarov] At the moment Russia has no enemies, politicians 
claim. Maybe the need to build new ships intensively has also 
ceased? 
  [Voronin] Sometimes I am asked a simple "peasant" question: 
Why can U.S. submarines dart around Severodvinsk while we cannot 
do the same near their country? Moreover, the opposing side 
refuses to hold any talks on cutting naval forces, considering 
itself a great naval power and guarantor of peace. Not only the 
United States is looking after its fleet. Work to build up 
China's naval forces has now been launched as never before. 
Hundreds of representatives of various firms and departments in 
that country are coming to us. I have met many of them and 
formed the conclusion that they have set themselves the task of 
making their country one of the most powerful naval powers in 
the near future. Recently I visited South Korea, where I met the 
president of the "Khala" [as translaiterated] firm. In 18 
months they intend to construct a new state-of-the-art shipyard. 
South Korea is currently the world's second biggest shipbuilder 
and will probably soon be the biggest. Even that small country 
intends to begin building submarines -- diesel submarines for 
the time being. While China is already interested in 
nuclear-powered submarines. Those two countries' strategy is to 
invest colossal amounts of money in their own naval forces. We 
have already sensed this during business contacts. 
  [Gundarov] Do you notice a desire on the part of our 
government to maintain Russia's naval might? 
  [Voronin] No. In our country, as is often the case, words 
are at variance with actions. Judging from the state orders 
which shipbuilders now have, our main customer is foreign rather 
than our Defense Ministry: Forty percent of domestic shipyards' 
capacities are starting to work for the West. 
  [Gundarov] In that case, what awaits the industrial complex 
which works for the Russian Navy? 
  [Voronin] We are waiting for the state to settle accounts 
with shipbuilders. I will cite just one figure. The state owes 
the "Sevmash" production association 130 billion rubles. For 
several months we have been promised that this money would be 
paid, but the debt has not yet been cleared. Hence, the 
enterprise has no circulating capital and the production chain 
is being destroyed. In short, all this is a string of truisms 
about which a considerable amount has already been said. 
  [Gundarov] Do you have specific proposals as to how to 
maintain production? 
  [Voronin] The matter is complicated by the fact that, on the 
one hand, conversion programs apparently exist but, on the 
other, they are not being implemented because finance for them 
is lacking. Therefore we are not elaborating proposals but 
specific subprograms for every plant. They do not have to 
choose right now. They are getting to work fulfilling any 
orders: Whether they be for peasants, oil or gas industry 
workers, or along ecological lines. 
  [Gundarov] And at the same time shipbuilding technology is 
being destroyed? 
  [Voronin] Yes, from the viewpoint of shipbuilding 
construction we are, of course, losing out. 
  [Gundarov] Maybe this is a consequence of the fact that 
there is no Navy lobby in the government? 
  [Voronin] To some extent I agree with you. There are many 
lobbyists of various persuasions. But as far as the Navy goes I 
do not see its lobbyists. Yuriy Yarov has a better grasp of the 
Navy's problems than others in the government. But 
unfortunately he is engaged in resolving other questions. But I 
do not sense in certain other people who have reached the 
crucible of power any understanding of the tasks facing the 
production complex, which in particular provides for the Navy's 
needs. This occurs because these people have not passed through 
the plant school. The moment has now come when nobody wants to 
hear the exhortations of practical people, and they themselves 
are called antireformists. But practical people would not have 
made the colossal mistakes we are now observing in the 
management of industry. The problem of cadres, I believe, is 
now the most pressing. Incidentally, I am for reforms, but they 
must be carried out in a more evolutionary way. 
  [Gundarov] What would you do first of all if the situation 
in which the Navy found itself depended entirely on you? 
  [Voronin] It is just the same as asking a mechanic at a 
technical servicing center what he would do first of all with a 
broken machine. First he would probably have a look at it. If 
we start at the beginning, I am convinced that industry could 
withstand 5 percent or a maximum of 10 percent conversion. 
Foreign experience demonstrates this. As conversion increases 
the production process becomes unmanageable, because it comes 
into conflict with science and economics. It is therefore hard 
to say what should be done first of all when everything has 
disintegrated. 
  Wars are raging all over the world. The situation in the 
Near East is complex, and it is becoming acute in Asia. The 
brake has been taken off the U.S. Navy. I think I would review 
the shipbuilding program and adopt a more careful attitude to 
reducing it. Obsolete ships, which are not combat-effective in 
a modern war, can be cut. But in fact we are cutting ships 
which have been in service only 15 years instead of 25. 
  Second, whether we like it or not, plants must not be 
allowed 
to fall below the "red" line. Otherwise, no edicts or orders 
will save production from collapsing. 
  [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, in ending our conversation, 
what would you -- the man who is building the Navy -- like to 
wish the Navy's sailors in the new year of 1994? 
  [Voronin] It is hard to find more optimistic people, 
although figuratively speaking they have to "fight" every day: 
When cruising, on combat service, or on alert status. I would 
like to wish that their optimism never deserts them. I am 
convinced that better times are ahead for the Navy, because we 
have a demonstrable trump card enabling us to be a naval power. 
And no political battles can take it away from us.

  Despite all the decisions issued by the President and the 
government, funds have not yet been allocated for liquidating 
the debt on the State Order for 1993 and the initial financing 
of the State Order for 1994. At the same time, the Ministry of 
Defense believes that payment of the debts presently constitutes 
one of the most important state priorities. 
  In connection with this, Russia's Ministry of Defense has 
issued another report to the government on the extremely 
difficult situation which has developed at enterprises which 
filled defense orders for 1993, but have still not received the 
money earned.

<F P=106> [Unattributed news item: "Minister of Defense of Ukraine </F>
Visits KB imeni Antonov"] 
  [Text] Minister of Defense General of the Army of Ukraine 
Vitaliy Radetskyy yesterday visited the Experimental Design 
Bureau [KB] imeni Antonov and was familiarized with its 
prospects and capabilities. The Antonov KB, as is well known, is 
the leading scientific-production base in Ukraine engaged in 
projects in the sphere of aircraft construction. The AN-124 
Ruslan and An-225 Mriya aircraft are well known around the world 
today. 
  But economic difficulties have not bypassed the 
"Antonovites" 
either. There are not enough funds, and the disruption of 
economic ties is having a negative effect. The task for the 
future, however, remains the same for the Antonov KB: Work for 
the benefit of Ukraine, and for the benefit of its armed forces. 
The discussion concerned just that, among other things, during a 
meeting of Minister of Defense General of the Army of Ukraine 
Vitaliy Radetskyy with Antonov KB General Director Petro 
Balabuyev. 
  An account will appear in an upcoming issue.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Senior Lieutenant </F>
Serhiy Zhurets: "Ukrainian Aviation Has Solid Wings"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, Minister of 
Defense General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy, Deputy 
Minister of Defense for Armaments and Armaments Chief of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk and 
Directorate of Industrial Orders and Industrial Liaison Chief 
Major-General Viktor Vashchilin visited the aviation scientific 
and technical complex (ANTK) imeni Oleh Antonov, which is the 
leading scientific and production base of Ukrainian aircraft 
construction. 
  The level of development of science and industry of a nation 
has traditionally been defined, and is defined, by achievements 
in aviation as well -- both civil and military. The Ukrainian 
aviation scientific and technical complex imeni Oleh Antonov has 
reason to be proud. It is enough to mention the An-124 Ruslan 
and An-225 Mriya aircraft, well known around the whole world. 
The "Antonovites" have also done a great deal for the 
development of military and military-transport aviation. A whole 
family of "An's" has served and is serving in the army: The 
An-2, An-8, An-12, An-26. An-30, An-72 and An-124. 
  But new times advance new demands. The building of effective 
and mobile Ukrainian armed forces is simply impossible unless 
the army is provided with contemporary models of hardware, 
including aviation hardware. That is how to explain the 
attention that the leadership of the Ministry of Defense is 
devoting to the emergence and development of the Ukrainian 
military-industrial complex, with an important place in it 
occupied by the ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov. 
  The deep traditions of aircraft construction, the widespread 
use of computer technology in the work and the adoption of new 
technologies are providing an opportunity for the Kiev 
specialists to develop aviation products that are the equal of 
the most advanced international demands. The representatives of 
the military department were convinced of that with their own 
eyes. 
  The Minister of Defense devoted considerable attention, 
while 
being familiarized with the prospects and capabilities of the 
ANTK, to the new transport aircraft with the working name of the 
An-77. The development and construction of this model is one of 
the few examples of very close collaboration between Ukraine and 
Russia, based on an international agreement. The An-77 surpasses 
the capabilities of analogous aircraft, both civil and those of 
military-transport aviation, in both freight capacity and in 
speed, altitude and range. Less than half of the necessary 
funds, however, were directed toward the requirements of the 
An-77 project, as was emphasized by ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov 
General Designer Petro Balabuyev. Moreover, the lion's share of 
that money was funds that the design bureau had earned through 
its own efforts. That is obviously insufficient. The first model 
of the new transport aircraft is planned to be ready to go out 
to the airfield for trials by the end of the month, and another 
model will have to be built and tested for objective results. It 
is difficult to say when this will be done. The Ukrainian 
aircraft-building industry, after all, is experiencing far from 
its best times: Skilled specialists are leaving because of the 
poor pay, and the disrupted business ties provide no opportunity 
for the timely performance of the necessary work. 
  Kiev has been visited more than once this year, however, 
both 
by representatives of the ministries of defense of Great Britain 
and France and by representatives of the FLA--an organization of 
countries in the European Community to which France, Germany, 
Great Britain, Italy and Spain belong. FLA specialists have been 
engaged for a long time in the development of a design for an 
analogous aircraft; they have not even begun the design 
engineering. The Ukrainian aircraft builders, however, have 
built the first aircraft, which virtually conforms to the FLA 
requirements. 
  The Kiev ANTK, by the way, can offer the nation and the 
armed 
forces more than a new transport aircraft. The arsenal of the 
design bureau has many more innovations, from a powered hang 
glider to an aerospace system based on the widebody Mriya 
aircraft as a launch platform. This system provides the 
opportunity to put a satellite into space with the assistance of 
rockets launched from the An-225 during aircraft flight. 
Furthermore, the cost of such a method is only one seventh that 
of a conventional vertical launch. And there is no need to 
explain the importance of our own satellites for the development 
of civil and military space. 
  Also discussed at the meeting was the fact that the ANTK 
imeni Oleh Antonov has an opportunity to take up the resolution 
of such problems as the development of trainer aircraft. General 
Designer Petro Balabuyev indicated that attention should be 
turned to the training of American military pilots. They first 
fly for thirty hours on trainer aircraft at the first level of 
difficulty, and then 75 hours on aircraft of the second level of 
difficulty; only after that do the pilots begin to master the 
combat aircraft directly. That way is both safer and more 
economical, which is very important under contemporary 
conditions when fuel is scarce. 
  "We are ready to develop such trainer aircraft for the needs 
of our military aviation," said Petro Vasylovych. "The need for 
them will arise sooner or later, after all." 
  So then, time will tell what problems they will be able to 
solve on the road to a modern, truly effective and mobile army. 
But we need to rely on two solid wings--industry and science--in 
order to attain that goal as quickly as possible, the more so 
with the intelligent expenditure of state funds.

Exists!"] 
  [Text] The new An-70 transport aircraft could be considered 
the latest achievement of the Ukrainian aircraft builders, 
following the An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya aircraft. President 
of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev decided to become personally 
acquainted with the first model of that aircraft, visiting the 
Kiev Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex imeni Antonov 
together with President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. The 
leadership of the military departments of Russia, Ukraine and 
Uzbekistan, meanwhile, have displayed an even greater interest 
in the new aircraft. And that is not surprising. The chief 
customers for the An-70 aircraft, after all, are the ministries 
of defense of Russia and Ukraine, who are ready to put this 
aircraft into service. All the more so as the development and 
construction of the new transport aircraft is one of the few 
examples of very close collaboration between Russia and Ukraine, 
based on an international agreement. President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk pointed out on that score that economic integration is 
an objective necessity in the international relations of the CIS 
countries. 
  It was pointed out that the An-70 transport aircraft has 
capabilities surpassing those of all existing transport 
aircraft. (The editors will talk about the An-70 in more detail 
in an upcoming issue.) This aircraft is planned to be 
manufactured at aviation enterprises in Ukraine, Russia and 
Uzbekistan. The first series-produced An-70 aircraft, however, 
will appear in the skies, at best, only in 1996.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Security Committee, by Valentin Maslennikov; date and place not 
given: "Without Bias or Timidity" -- first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] In 20 years Viktor Ilyukhin progressed from 
ordinary investigator in a Penza backwater to First Deputy Chief 
of a USSR Procurator's Office Main Administration; he headed the 
administration overseeing the application of laws on state 
security. He became politically known after he instituted 
criminal proceedings against Gorbachev, General Secretary of the 
then-ruling CPSU, for which he was dismissed from the 
Procurator's Office. He is now Chairman of the State Duma 
Security Committee. At the editorial office's request Viktor 
Ivanovich shares his thoughts on the plans and prospects for the 
work of this most important section of the new parliament: 
  [Ilyukhin] Many people are troubled by my party membership: 
How come a communist has been elected to such a responsible post 
in a legislative organ of a democratic state? But I do not see 
that this interferes in any way with a collegial organ's 
fruitful work. Incidentally, all three of my deputies belong to 
different parties which society also regards equivocally. 
Viktor Pimenovich Mironov represents "Russia's Choice," Sergey 
Semenovich Boskholov the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and 
Nina Viktorovna Krivelskaya the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia. They are all first-class jurists and professionals in 
the best sense of the word. 
  From the very first steps in our joint work we have set 
aside 
our party bias and sought a common language and mutual 
understanding. The committee has a total of 20 members and the 
volume of work is enormous. It is encouraging that the other 
committee members are also highly qualified jurists. We have 
expert lawyers, people with experience of working in courts and 
internal affairs organs, and attorneys with a wealth of 
practical experience. 
  At our very first session we found out that a collective of 
like minds is forming and that everyone is concerned about one 
thing: The lack of a clear concept of the country's national 
security, thought out in the finest detail. So first of all we 
will be working hard to elaborate one. 
  Not an easy task, because we are faced with a whole range of 
interconnected problems which are difficult to solve. Taking 
national security to mean first of all the consolidation 
of a state's territorial integrity and unity, we are 
singling out four main facets. They are borders, customs, 
federal security services including border troops, and, of 
course, economic security. All this needs to be clearly 
enshrined in legislation. 
  The next set of pressing problems is legal support for 
the fight against crime on the basis of a long-term, 
wide-ranging program which includes scientific substantiation, 
finances, cadre policy, and many other things. 
  The implementation of this program is also directly linked 
with the direct protection of the person and his 
individuality, which we are wont to talk about a lot but 
which we in fact push into the background. So an urgent change 
of emphasis from words to deeds is needed. Incidentally, what 
is required in this respect is a review of the state of 
emergency legislation, which must also protect people first and 
foremost and not be reduced to sharing out authority. 
  Finally, the fourth set is an expert criminological 
assessment of all draft laws passing through the Duma, 
irrespective of who has prepared them. It is up to us to detect 
all the flaws in legislative acts which could substantially 
complicate the criminogenic situation in the country. 
  Of course, the committee will not be able to cope with this 
volume of work alone. We plan to bring in expert specialists 
and scientific subdivisions of practical experts. Discussion 
papers are already available. We are finding good understanding 
in other Duma committees. 
  At the very first session we defined our priority tasks. 
They include finalizing work on the Law on Combating 
Corruption. The attention to this question is easily explained: 
The crime rate is increasing, there is a tidal wave of illegal 
acts, and bribery and mercenary string-pulling have corroded the 
entire state executive mechanism, including the law-enforcement 
organs. This retards any healthy transformations in Russia. 
  Mafia clans are already dictating their policy not only at 
the neighborhood level but also in entire cities and oblasts, 
and in some places they are even taking control of legislators' 
activities. This will continue as long as an official at any 
level is dependent on his boss' will and whim. He must obey 
only the law and must serve it faithfully and truly. 
  The law had already been prepared by our predecessors and 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet, but it was not signed by the 
president. In my view, the reason is not the shortcomings it 
undoubtedly contains but the struggle between several schools of 
law, whose representatives were unable to agree among themselves 
but were able to persuade the president to postpone the law's 
adoption. Through the efforts of two committees -- ours and the 
one on legislation and judicial reform -- we have already held a 
first hearing on the law and we will soon be submitting it for 
consideration at a Duma session sitting. It cannot be postponed 
any longer. 
  Two other draft laws are next in line -- "On the State 
Protection of Judges and Employees of Law-Enforcement and 
Control Organs" and "On the Protection of Witnesses, Victims, 
and Other People Assisting in Legal Proceedings." They brook no 
delay either. Because judges and MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] employees are being murdered, witnesses and victims are 
being intimidated, and their families are being kept in fear. 
How can a judge or court official who is besieged, totally 
dependent, and lacking life's essentials be objective? What is 
the use of a militiaman who does not feel that he is backed up 
by state protection? How can the evidence of a witness be 
relied on if, outside the precincts of the court, he is not 
protected from the criminals he is accusing? 
  We predict that these laws will not have an easy passage 
through the Duma. Not because deputies do not understand their 
importance and timeliness but because some legislators will 
think that the state cannot afford them at the moment. 
Nevertheless, this expenditure must be made if we seriously 
intend to fight crime and really protect people. 
  The committee has extensive plans. We have a great deal to 
do to improve the criminal and criminal-procedure codes and we 
will be taking part in the drafting of laws on the Prosecutor's 
Office, the legal profession, the Constitutional Court, and many 
other things. 
  I want to single out especially the upcoming work to 
legislatively enshrine the new status of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. This is a difficult question 
which will certainly provoke many disputes and disagreements. 
In my opinion, the president exceeded his powers by disbanding 
the Security Ministry. The new Constitution does not give him 
the right to autonomously destroy and reform institutions of 
state authority. In place of what is, especially now, a vitally 
essential part of the law-enforcement system yet another 
presidential special service has been formed. There are too 
many of them as it is. 
  Something similar can be observed with the MVD. Essentially 
the enforcement structures are being removed from Prosecutor's 
Office oversight and judicial and parliamentary control, and 
levers of authoritarian power are being strengthened. During 
its reorganization the FCS lost its investigation apparatus. 
This is a blow to its capability. The shield remains but the 
sword has been taken away. 
  I grant that some people will not agree with me, but I will 
defend my opinion both inside and outside committee sessions. A 
considerable number of these complex debates lie ahead of us. 
  Just take the question of borders. It is no longer possible 
to put up with the large-meshed sieve into which they have now 
turned. But to construct new ones will require at least five to 
seven years of intensive work and expenditure equal to twice or 
three times Russia's annual budget (without drinking, eating, or 
spending a cent on anything else). There is one solution: To 
agree with our close neighbors on a single external CIS border. 
  They cannot protect it by themselves -- as eloquently 
demonstrated by Tajikistan's experience. That means that we 
must form joint border troops -- which requires an interstate 
accord. We must not shy away from each other but act hand in 
hand. What is of help here is both our historical experience 
and the recognition of the prospect of the inevitable 
unification of the collapsed Union on a new basis. 
  West Europe's experience indicates the same: Strength 
through unification. Most of our countries' inhabitants think 
the same: Because they were cut for real when they were 
separated, borders were drawn through families and futures. In 
my opinion, the only obstacle now is leaders' political 
ambitions. 
  I by no means want to switch the conversation about our 
committee's plans to the political plane. But when national 
security is being discussed there is no escaping politics. Our 
committee does not consider itself to be exceeding its powers in 
putting forward some urgent demands and recommendations to the 
Federal Assembly, the country's government, and the Russian 
president. In particular, in order to achieve our national 
security the country's and the Foreign Ministry's leaders must 
urgently agree with all CIS countries that the latter will not 
wholly or partly join any military bloc opposing Russia. And I 
believe that a strict demand should be put to our Baltic 
neighbors: One of the mandatory conditions for the withdrawal 
of our troops from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is a pledge on 
their part not to join any military bloc with other states and 
not to allow foreign military bases to be located on their 
territory. 
  So, the tasks facing our committee are complex and crucial, 
just like the concept of security itself.

  [Abstract] Until recently, trajectory designs have involved 
a single-stage, one-impulse flight to halo orbit near libration 
points L[.sup]1[/] and L[.sub]2[/] of the Sun-Earth 
system. Launch parameters were chosen so that after boost near 
Earth, the spacecraft would enter a trajectory passing rather 
close to the libration points, with halo orbit C = 0. Farquhar 
has proposed a design that reduces the orbit-size parameters 
("Halo-Orbit and Lunar Swing-by Missions of the 1990's," 41st 
Congress of the IAF, October 1990, Germany) and that recommends 
a rendezvous with the Moon not immediately after launch, but 
after a given number of revolutions in a highly elliptical orbit 
whose perigee is near the Earth and whose apogee distance is 
greater than the radius of the lunar orbit. There is yet to be 
any published data, however, on the possible use of such a 
trajectory to perform the Relict-2 mission in the context of the 
constraints on the control system that is to be used in the 
mission. Analysis shows that a design with two revolutions in 
intermediate orbit is best for trajectories involving a lunar 
swing-by. The researchers here analyze the control 
characteristics for only the segment before lunar rendezvous. 
Their analysis considers launch errors, as well as measurement 
and correction-execution errors. Fuel expenditure at the 
velocity typical for performing control during entry into halo 
orbit is the principal criterion for quality of control. Control 
parameters are calculated for flight trajectories based on 
launches in October and November 1994. Figures 4, references 5: 
3 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] In earlier works, the researchers examined 
optimal transfers between the lunar surface and lunar orbit for 
a spacecraft with a rocket engine of high, but limited thrust, 
with landing and liftoff sites not fixed. Those studies focused 
on fastest transfer, as well as transfer with a minimum value 
for the compromise functional of time-mass expenditure. The 
transfers were set in a central Newtonian gravitation field in 
the plane of orbit of an artificial lunar satellite, with thrust 
vector controlled. This paper builds on the earlier work, but 
involves the spatial characteristics of the transfer of the same 
spacecraft in the same lunar context. The researchers discuss 
the numerical solution of boundary value problems for 13th and 
14th-order systems of the usual nonlinear differential equations 
that appear when the solution of the problems of optimal control 
of motion of the center of mass of the spacecraft is based on 
the maximum principle. In the current context, solution that 
involves shooting requires selection of 4-6 unknown initial 
conditions. Figures 5, references 33 (Russian).

  [Abstract] A great deal of practical value attaches to the 
study of the propagation in the Earth's atmosphere of x-ray 
emissions from deep-space nuclear explosions and the secondary 
physical phenomena produced by such explosions. This paper 
examines the possibility of ground-based recording of uneven 
light emissions excited in the Earth's atmosphere by an x-ray 
beam whose parameters are typical of an x-ray laser with pumping 
from a nuclear explosion. Since uneven light emissions in the 
atmosphere are isotropic, they can be recorded at great 
distances from the beam axis. The researchers here examine the 
process associated with the light signal generation and 
calculate the amplitude-time characteristics of a light signal 
that comes about when an x-ray beam from a cosmic source 
interacts with the atmosphere. The light emissions achieve 
maximum intensity within 10[.sup]-8[/]-10[.sup]-5[/] sec. 
That time is a function of the position of the recording site: 
the farther the site is from the beam, the greater the time. 
Pulse width is also a function of recording-site position: the 
closer the site is to the beam, the faster the intensity grows 
(10[.sup]-5[/]-10[.sup]-4[/] sec). Figures 2, references 
18: 11 Russian, 7 Western.

523.037:525.7] 
  [Abstract] The search for phenomena tying anomalous 
variations in certain physical characteristics of near-Earth 
space to geoseismic activity has, to some extent, been 
successful in that satellite studies have uncovered anomalous 
low-frequency electromagnetic radiation in the upper ionosphere 
over the epicenters of earthquakes just before the ground 
activity begins. The source of the radiation is believed to be a 
ULF/ELF wave generated by seismoelectric transformations in the 
earthquake focus. The considerable spread of the parameters of 
the anomalous radiation in near-Earth space and the episodic 
nature of the phenomenon point to the variety and ambiguity of 
the generation and propagation of the seimoelectromagnetic 
radiation. The movement of such radiation into the ionosphere 
and the magnetosphere could cause variations in certain physical 
characteristics of charge particles of near-Earth plasma. Such 
has been the conclusion of research that studied the 
relationship between short-term sporadic deviations in the flux 
of high-energy particles trapped by the geomagnetic field and 
geoseismic activity. Analysis of the relationship between number 
of earthquakes and difference between the time of main shock and 
time of deviation of particle flux has produced a figure of 
t 
as approximately 2.5 hours. The researchers here set out to 
either confirm that finding or refute it by examining data 
obtained for the period of 16 June to 16 July 1990. They studied 
variations preceding the lithospheric earthquakes by 1-5 hours 
and focused near the L parameter corresponding to a projection 
of the earthquake coordinates to an altitude of 100 km. 
Sixty-four percent of the earthquakes occurring within the 
stated time frame were in a region whose center had the 
coordinates of 37N lat, 49.5E long. The researchers 
confirmed a space-time correlation between earthquakes with a 
magnitude of 3 or greater and the anomalous variation. Figures 
3, references 13: 11 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] According to radio astronomy data, many cosmic 
radiation sources have a spectrum in which F(_n_) is 
proportional to _n_[.sup]-_a_[/] in the frequency range of 
10[.sup]6[/]-10[.sup]9[/] Hz, with F(_n_) representing the 
radiation intensity. The spectral value of the radiation, _a_, 
is usually 0.5-1. Its distribution is gaussian, with a mean 
value of 0.75 and a standard deviation of 0.15. Since that type 
of spectrum cannot be attributed to thermal radiation, the 
nonequilibrium cosmic radiation is generally described with a 
synchrotron model. Particle polarization and the spatial 
coincidence between the system of cosmic magnetic fields and the 
sources of the nonequilibrium radiation point to the verity of 
such an approach. In proposing a new mechanism for the origin of 
the power-law spectrum of the cosmic radio emissions, the 
researcher demonstrates that, under the right conditions, the 
power-law spectrum can be a consequence of the fractal geometry 
of the spatial distribution of radiating relativistic electrons. 
Fractal dimensionality D of the distribution is related to 
spectral value with the formula D = _a_ + 1/3. As obtained from 
an analysis of observed values of the spectral values, the 
distribution was found to be 1.08 +/-0.15 in the range of 
10-10[.sup]5[/] cm. References 10: 6 Russian, 4 Western.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Smirnov: "A General Cleanup of Space Must </F>
Begin"; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Who does not know the words from the "Little Prince" 
by Saint-Exupery: "He got up in the morning, washed up, put 
himself in order and immediately brought his planet into order! 
We know very well what must be done for the purity of the 
oceans, forests, cities and the atmosphere. We do a poor job of 
monitoring, to be sure. But it is not suspected that space also 
must be brought into order. Meanwhile the accumulation of space 
debris hides a danger which is in no way less dangerous than 
that from the `ozone holes.' This was told to me by Lidiya 
Rykhlova, a department head at the Astronomical Institute, 
Russian Academy of Sciences." 
  Too frequently people concentrate on the lesser evil, not 
seeing that right here, alongside, a different and greater 
misfortune is taking shape. For example, how many now speak of 
the meteorite danger for cosmonauts! But now the Americans have 
carried out the following experiment: on a returned satellite 
they counted the number of impacts from bodies of cosmic and 
artificial origin. There were far more of the latter. Scientists 
assert: the total mass of natural bodies in near space now does 
not exceed 200 kg. And that they and we have littered there 
about 3 million kilograms. So in actuality are cosmonauts 
threatened? 
  The first task of the new world space "service" is to 
monitor 
the unplanned falling of artificial space objects. But there 
also are other cases. The objects do not fall to the surface, 
but without warning explode in space and this may cause a 
precipitous increase in fragments on the "falling domino" 
principle. 
  For example, our Proton booster is one of the most reliable 
in the world. For this booster virtually all the shots into 
orbit have been "without a miss." But now it has been clarified 
at the conference on space debris: the last stage of the Proton, 
when after it has put a satellite into orbit, continues to 
"dangle" in space and after several years may explode. Six such 
cases were discovered. If it is taken into account that there 
already have been about 200 Proton launchings (and 6- 7 are 
still being planned annually), you can visualize how these 
"cleanest" rockets will increase the danger. 
  Now through the joint efforts of our and American 
specialists 
the reasons for the explosions seemingly have been clarified and 
will be eliminated. But in any case there also is one more 
common reason: attention has been concentrated on current 
launches and what will happen there after five years with the 
spent parts gives no one concern. 
  In this connection the problem acutely arises of stationary 
satellites, in particular, meteorological communication 
satellites. These are vehicles which are launched to such an 
altitude that at all times they hover over the very same point 
on the Earth, revolving together with it with the same angular 
velocity. Since the orbit of these satellites is unique and 
individual, a small "window" has been allocated to each country 
with an admissible deviation from it of only 74 km. 
  Upon exhausting its useful life, the satellite remains in 
this "small window." It would be good to have it removed from 
there in order not to hinder new launches. But this will cost as 
much as its operation for a month. When the dilemma arises of 
removing a satellite from orbit a month before exhaustion of its 
useful life or receiving valuable information for a month more, 
the latter choice is usually made. But, indeed, ever-newer 
satellites are being launched there. 
  True, there already have been precedents for more long-range 
solutions. Already in 1979 the Soviet Union removed the first 
such satellite from orbit. Some other countries took the same 
step. But in most cases stationary satellites remain in their 
orbits, concentrating into very small space "clusters." 
  Visualize that in this dense clustering of satellites there 
is an unplanned explosion of a spent vehicle. Indeed, already 
about 4500 satellites of different countries have accumulated in 
this orbit. Incidentally, there have already been such 
explosions, but up to this time we do not know how many 
fragments they have generated. Observations from the surface 
make it possible to see only fragments which are larger than a 
meter. 
  It is clear that observation methods and instruments must be 
improved. But something else also is clear: there must be strict 
international laws restricting and preventing space 
contamination, in this respect regulating both the launch of 
vehicles and their return to the Earth. 
  How to contend with space debris? It is possible to find a 
traditional way: by strengthening the skins of ships, their 
resistance to meteorites and the fragments of man-made vehicles. 
But it also is possible to decrease the number of launches 
without thereby reducing the amount of equipment put into orbit. 
Indeed, the principal component of space debris is cast-off 
rocket stages and the common task of all the space powers is 
"cleaning up" their technology in order that it be accompanied 
by the fewest parts so that fewer of them will be "dumped" in 
space. Unfortunately, for the time being there are no impressive 
projects for the cleanup of space anywhere in the world; perhaps 
this is in the imagination of science fiction writers. Mankind, 
as before, lives in this respect in accordance with the Russian 
proverb: "as long as the thunder does not burst forth, the 
peasant does not cross himself." 
  But the time for crossing oneself has long passed. For 
example, orbiting the Earth at a relatively low altitude there 
are 54 satellites with radioactive energy sources aboard. In 
principle it is assumed that when their active existence ceases 
there will be sufficient time for the nuclear fuel to 
"deactivate" to a safe level. But, indeed, here also there were 
unpredictable, unmonitorable accidents. Misfortune could be 
prevented through the common efforts of different countries. 
Incidentally, the last such case became the direct reason for 
the first meeting of space "cleaners" in Germany, at Darmstadt, 
in 1992. 
  The second conference of the International Coordinating 
Committee on Space Debris was held recently in Moscow. 
Absolutely new business and for the time being four 
organizations are participating in it: the Russian, European and 
Japanese Space Agencies and NASA. Working groups on 
observations, measurements, compilation of catalogues, research 
on the environmental impact, on tests and protection and on 
reducing contamination are already in operation. In short, the 
"reduction of space to order" has begun. For the time being work 
is for the most part with modeling. But the time is coming when 
in circumterrestrial space there will be gigantic vacuum 
cleaners, debris collection machines, debris containers and 
conductors. 
  Scientists and specialists are sounding the alarm. Even 
astronomers are complaining: space debris is hindering 
observations and more and more often it is being mistaken for 
meteorites and novae. But people throughout the world will sleep 
calmly, that is, until a manmade fragment crashes onto their 
heads.

Market Is Interested in the `Know-How' of Russian Aerospace 
Materials Science"; the first paragraph is an introduction; the 
last three paragraphs provide general information] 
  [Text] The development of new materials with stipulated 
properties is now considered throughout the world as one of the 
key directions in technological progress, comparable in 
importance information science and communication. The "leading 
edge" of this development work is intended for aviation and 
rocket-space machine building. Russian development firms have 
strong technological positions in this field, which enabled them 
relatively successfully to carry out the first stage of entry 
into the world market: about 20% of the financing of the 
programs is now accounted for by foreign contracts. The 
representatives of the leading Russian enterprises -- NPO VIAM, 
NPO Kompozit and others -- became frequent guests of Western 
colleagues: in particular, a delegation of the NPO VIAM during 
the past week held scheduled consultations with the Dassault 
Company and other French partners. Our reviewer Sergey Morgachev 
and our expert Igor Vershinin comment on the situation in this 
market. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-USP-001C-10A>           World market for aerospace materials </FIG>



<H5>  Results of Technological Race </H5>
  Russian enterprises have a general advantage over Western 
competitors with respect to metallic materials for aerospace 
technology. In the case of ceramics one can speak in general of 
parity, although the relation of capabilities with respect to 
different types of materials is different. With respect to 
composite materials, the United States has the general 
advantage, although in this field as well some Russian 
developments are entirely competitive. 
  Specialists point out the leadership of Russian firms with 
respect to the strength and plastic qualities of alloys based on 
aluminum, molybdenum and niobium with their high melting points, 
as well as intermetallide compounds, and heat-resistant nickel 
alloys. The All- Russian Institute of Aviation Materials (NPO 
VIAM) stands out as the leading firm for conceptual development 
work, whereas experimental production is for the most part 
concentrated in the All-Russian Institute of Light Alloys (both 
in Moscow). 
  Nowhere in the world is there an equal to Russian heat- and 
erosion- resistant protective ceramic coverings based on silicon 
and zirconium compounds and heat-shielding ceramics based on 
quartz and carbon-carbon compounds. Many of these technologies 
were developed in their time within the framework of the Buran 
program. The principal enterprises working along these lines are 
the NPO VIAM and the NPO Tekhnologiya. The United States, on the 
other hand, leads the way in another key direction in work in 
the ceramics field: development of construction materials for 
engines. 
  Finally, Russian composite materials of the carbon-carbon 
and 
carbon- silicon carbide type, used for heat shielding of 
construction elements, are of equal quality to American 
products. The methods for producing these materials are 
technologically more feasible, simpler than the corresponding 
American methods. The key Russian firms working in this field 
are the NPO Kompozit and the State Scientific Research Institute 
for Graphite-Based Materials.

<H5>  Russian Technologies Flowed Across the Boundary </H5>
  Unfortunately, Russian firms for the time being are 
operating 
for the most part using old technological development methods. 
New work requires thoroughly adequate financing which can be 
ensured only when the entire aerospace complex emerges from its 
crisis and its domestic and foreign markets are restored. Direct 
foreign contracts for the sale of technologies concluded during 
the last year or two by Russian firms have proven their 
practical worth but are no more than a tactical solution for the 
problem of retaining their place among the world leaders of the 
branch. 
  Among the partners who have already concluded contracts are 
the following: NPO VIAM and the ONERA company in France 
(coverings based on carbon and carbon-carbon materials); NPO 
VIAM and Dasso in France (attachment parts from niobium alloys 
with antioxidation coverings); NPO VIAM and the SEP company in 
France (intermetallide materials of the nickel-aluminum and 
titanium-aluminum type); NPO Tekhnologiya and the ONERA company 
in France (fibrous quartz-based heat-shielding materials); NPO 
Kompozit and the CSIRO company in France (carbon-based 
composites); NPO VIAM, NPO Tekhnologiya and Beijing Institute of 
Aviation Materials (nickel and titanium alloys, including 
equipment for their production, construction ceramics). It is 
assumed that the financial receipts from foreign contracts in 
1993 will amount to about 1/5 of total amount of income for the 
firms engaged in development work on aerospace materials. 
  Negotiations and consultations are now underway for 
concluding contracts between the NPO VIAM, NPO Kompozit, NPO 
Tekhnologiya and Rolls Royce in Great Britain, Goldschmidt G.A., 
MTU Munchen (Germany), United Aircraft, United Technologies and 
Dow Corning in the United States, and the Indian Space Agency. 
In addition, Russian developers of such materials evidently will 
receive subcontracts in connection with the Russian- American 
project for the orbital station Alpha. For the time being it has 
not come to the handing out of these orders, but hypothetically 
the priority in such awards will be to the Kompozit enterprise 
as the firm traditionally belonging to the rocket-space complex. 
  The Russian presence in the world market is gradually 
expanding. American companies, not interested so much in Russian 
technologies as in the economic optimization of their projects 
by cooperation with Russia, are ready to place orders in Russia 
for finished products, including the development and production 
of materials. With respect to West European companies, they 
specifically covet Russian technologies (which they need, in 
particular, in connection with work on the HERMES and HOTOL 
spaceplanes). 
<H5>  World Market </H5>
  The world market for materials for aerospace machine 
building 
by the beginning of the 1990's was about 15 billion dollars 
(including Russian production in world prices); about 1/3 of the 
volume of this market was accounted for by Russia. This share, 
unquestionably, has now undoubtedly decreased due to the general 
economic crisis in Russia. The United States is taking the 
leading role in the market. The principal group of goods, as 
before, remains metallic materials, despite a tendency to their 
being squeezed out by ceramics and composites (see diagram). 
<H5>  Aerospace Materials </H5>
  The creation of modern types of aviation and space equipment 
requires the development of materials having enormous resistance 
to mechanical loads, high pressures, aggressive media, high 
temperatures and multiple changes in operating mode. 
  Most of the market is accounted for by metallic materials: 
based on aluminum (covering of wings, structural and reinforcing 
components), nickel (heat-resistant components of gas turbine 
engines), iron (reinforcing components), titanium (structural 
components, skin and attachment components, lines), materials 
with a high melting point -- molybdenum, niobium, tungsten 
(nozzles, control surfaces, structural and attachment 
components), intermetallide compounds (high-temperature units). 
Ceramic materials (based on graphite, oxides, carbides, borides) 
are used as coverings of metals for their protection against 
oxidation, wear and erosion, and also as heat-shielding 
elements, and in the future -- as engine components. Composite 
materials (a combination of materials of the type metal-ceramic, 
ceramic-ceramic, polymer-polymer) are used as components of the 
skin, propellers, compressor blades, ailerons, other control 
surfaces and chassis, for the skins of rockets and in structural 
components of fuel tanks.

Single Step From Cosmic to Comical. Curious End to Discredited 
Offspring of the Cold War Era"] 
  [Text] Five years have elapsed since the day of the first 
Buran flight. And the last: all work on the ill-fated shuttle 
has ceased and one of its three copies has been delivered to 
Gorkiy Culture Park where in the spring of the coming year the 
presentation of a new space attraction should occur. This 
mind-boggling stunt puts an end to 20 years of efforts of 
several hundred enterprises of the military-industrial complex 
in creating an aerospace complex costing the state over 20 
million rubles in the old preinflation prices. There's no doubt 
about it: the Buran, as the world's most expensive attraction, 
was guaranteed entry into the Guinness Book of Records. It 
appears that it is but a single step from cosmic to comical... 
  Is such a curious end legitimate? How could it happen that 
the work of hundreds of thousands of highly skilled designers, 
engineers and workers was necessary to no one and will go only 
to please the unexacting tastes of latter-day multimillionaires 
seeking "nonterrestrial sensations?" 
  Many responsible leaders of our rocket-space industry even 
today assert that the Energiya-Buran complex is a major 
scientific-technical achievement and the discontinuation of its 
further development was caused only by financial difficulties 
arising with the onset of the changeover to a market economy in 
the country. But if the Buran is so good as it has been made out 
to be, why was it impossible for it to replace the Soyuz ship 
already created in the 1960's? 
  It is time to acknowledge that the Buran, only once flying 
into space in an automatic mode on 15 November 1988, is a 
discredited offspring of the cold war era when the Soviet 
government allocated the lion's share of the state budget to 
direct and indirect military expenditures, being guided by the 
principle: "We will spare no cost..." 
  This same principle was naturally followed by the creators 
of 
our first aerospace complex supposedly with multiple 
reusability. By order of the Ministry of Defense they designed 
and constructed an orbital glider (on the Buran there is no 
propulsion engine, in contrast to the Shuttle -- the American 
orbital aircraft). But a glider, as is well known, cannot take 
off by itself. And then it was decided that the putting of the 
Buran into orbit would be delegated to the superpowerful and 
ultraexpensive Energiya booster, both stages of which tumble to 
the ground in heaps of scrap metal several minutes after the 
launch. 
  The result was astounding: the cost of one flight of the 
multireusable shuttle was ten times greater than the 
expenditures on launching of the single-use Soyuz. Moreover, 
even prior to the Buran flight it had become clear that in the 
foreseeable future there would be no call for its 30- ton 
payload capacity. For regular communications with the Mir 
station and even for the construction of an orbital station of a 
new generation it is entirely adequate to have a ship with a 
load-carrying capacity not greater than 10 tons. 
  In the history of national cosmonautics the undertaking with 
the Buran enters as a very important engineering blunder -- the 
second after the failure with the sorrowfully remembered N-1 
lunar rocket, all four experimental launches of which ended with 
enormous explosions. It is important not to allow new 
miscalculations in the stage of conceptual designing of 
aerospace systems of the future. Unfortunately, the 
prerequisites for such miscalculations are already in place. 
  The MAKS project was developed at the very same NPO Molniya 
where the Buran was constructed: it is proposed that this sort 
of "Little Buran" orbital aircraft, three times smaller in size 
and mass, be sent into space from aboard the giant Mriya 
transport aircraft. One has to ask: is the game worth the 
candle? Indeed, the speed to which the Mriya will be able to 
propel the orbital aircraft does not exceed 3% of first 
cosmic 
velocity. 
  Whereas the MAKS is oriented on the use of a two-stage 
complex, which although low velocity is an already existing 
entity, as the first stage, in a number of other projects 
reliance is on accelerating aircraft, which for the time being 
still remain mythical. From time to time even completely 
irresponsible calls are made to proceed to the technical 
designing and construction of an experimental copy of a 
single-stage spaceplane not having any parts separable in flight. 
  In such projects, whose first variants were proposed about 
30 
years ago, provision is made for a too light-weight approach to 
the problem of creating highly efficient and reliable hypersonic 
air-jet engines, involving primarily the development of 
adjustable hypersonic air intakes and ensuring a stable process 
of hydrogen combustion in a supersonic air flow. For the time 
being it has not been possible to solve this problem fully, even 
theoretically. But from the practical point of view it must be 
admitted that air-jet engines, capable of reliably operating 
under the enormous thermal and mechanical loads of hypersonic 
flight, can be created only on the basis of 21st-century 
materials and technologies. 
  As indicated by experience in aircraft construction in our 
country and abroad, from 8 to 15 years will be spent on the 
designing, construction and testing of an aircraft engine -- two 
or three times greater than on the development of a new 
aircraft. Therefore, one should not think in terms of 
realization of projects for a two-stage (much less a 
single-stage) spaceplane in the years immediately ahead. 
  The multiply reusable aerospace system most promising with 
respect to the possibilities of its embodiment in metal with the 
use of already mastered technologies must be considered a 
two-stage complex whose first stage is a rocket plane, that is 
an aircraft carrier with liquid-propellant jet engines. In such 
a system a vertically launched rocket plane carrying an orbital 
aircraft (second stage) is propelled to estimated hypersonic 
velocity, after which it descends in a gliding flight and makes 
a landing like an aircraft at a stipulated airfield, whereas an 
orbital aircraft outfitted like the Shuttle has its own 
liquid-propellant jet engine and is prepropelled to first cosmic 
velocity. Performing its assigned task in orbit, the orbital 
aircraft returns to the place of landing of the rocket plane for 
preparation for a repeated flight. 
  A reasonable question may arise: do we have to be concerned 
at all with aerospace systems during such difficult times? 
  We will not delve into profound reasonings on the subject of 
the irreversibility of scientific-technical progress. We will 
simply recall how the cosmonauts returning from a regular 
expedition to the Mir station were retrieved from the Soyuz 
ship. Over the landed ship the search team set up a step ladder 
with a block and tackle, by means of which the cosmonauts were 
extracted through the narrow hatch. Debilitated in the course of 
the Soyuz descent by the operation of 8-g acceleration after 
prolonged exposure to weightlessness, with forced smiles on 
their faces they sat down in the seats prepared for them... 
  But now the astronauts flying in the Shuttles in all flight 
stages need not experience accelerations greater than 3 g. And 
it must be surmised that they leave their ship after landing 
almost with the same ease with which passengers of a modern 
airliner descend along the stairs. They are to be envied!

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Lomanov: "Aerokosmos Will Be Launched in </F>
Two Years. Sea-Based Missiles Also Are Launchable From Aircraft"] 
  [Text] All modern Russian ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with 
which navy submarines have been outfitted have been constructed 
at the state missile center Design Bureau imeni V. P. Makeyev 
(Miass). With the reduction of strategic arms good possibilities 
are being afforded for the transformation of military into 
commercial carriers. The bureau has proposed two fields for use 
of naval submarines for putting peaceful research or 
technological satellites into space or into the upper layers of 
the atmosphere. 
  The Priboy project (BMN N 39) was oriented on the launching 
of missiles from the sea surface. The Aerokosmos project 
proposes that heavy aircraft, especially the An-124 "Ruslan," 
and in the future, the An-225 "Mriya," be used as launch pads. 
The rocket engine (it is proposed that reoutfitted SS-N-23 and 
SS-N-20 engines be used) is fired only after the launch pad, 
together with a parachute system, descends from the aircraft to 
an altitude of about 12 km. The launches can be made at a 
distance up to 4000 km from airfields (superclass or first 
class). 
  Despite such different launch methods the Priboy and 
Aerokosmos projects combine a high operability, mobility and 
total autonomy. They do not require a cosmodrome and these means 
that there is no need for alienating extensive areas beneath the 
zone of falling of spent stages. 
  An extremely important circumstance is that an object can be 
attached to a rocket on vessels or aircraft directly at the 
bases of the client (in some cases this will help in avoiding 
COCOM restrictions). 
  As reported by Rem Kanin, head of the KBM laboratory, the 
commercial operation of the Aerokosmos system will presumably 
begin in 1996-1997. The Shtil-3A (SS-N-23) rocket can be put 
into an equatorial orbit with an altitude from 200 to 700 km 
with a payload 730-950 kg. 
  BMN: The AO Aerokosmos (founders -- State Rocket Center 
Design Bureau imeni V. P. Makeyev and the Chelyabinsk 
association Tekhnopolis) was established for realization of the 
project. The association RAM-KON, AO Volga-Dnepr and a number of 
design bureaus and scientific research institutes participating 
in the reoutfitting of SLBM intend to take part in the project.

  This original development of the body of institute 
scientists 
and designers is intended for putting satellites and scientific 
modules into orbit and removing them from orbit and has the same 
many degrees of freedom as the human hand. The length of the 
space "arm" is 15.3 m, its mass is 350 km and the rate of 
movement of a load weighing up to 30 tons (in space) is about 4 
cm per second. The principal model of "arm" control is 
automatic, but a manual mode, with the operator's intervention, 
also is possible. 
  The photograph shows finalization of spatial tests of the 
manipulator.

  [Abstract] Nimbus-7 TOMS data collected daily over a 
13-year period (January 1979 to January 1992) was used to 
analyze total ozone variability over St. Petersburg. Average 
monthly total-ozone values were subjected to Fourier analysis in 
order to calculate the amplitude, phase, and relative 
contribution of each of the three first harmonics to the overall 
total-ozone variability. The principal conclusion reached by the 
researchers is that heterogenous chemical reactions result in a 
modification of the usual chemical processes in the Arctic 
circumpolar vortex, which in turn enhances total-ozone depletion 
of anthropogenic origin. The effect is also seen in the middle 
latitudes as a result of the movement of air masses from the 
polar latitudes when the circumpolar vortex breaks down. A 
negative gradient obtains for active chlorine away from the 
pole, and the movement to the middle latitudes stimulates 
processes that destroy ozone. Figures 3, references 21: 4

  [Abstract] Images produced in the sensing of the Earth's 
surface with active and passive space-based systems are 
represented in binary form, with subsequently preliminary 
processing. Part of that processing involves local filtration. 
The work reported here examines procedures for recursive 
nonlinear filtration. A mathematical model of the procedures is 
constructed, and the probability efficiency of a recursive 
filter is compared with that of a nonrecursive filter (maximum 
probabilities of events are y = 1 and y = 0. With p = 0.1, the 
recursive filter produced a probability value of P(y = 1) = 
0.0122, whereas the nonrecursive filter produced a value of P(y 
= 1) = 0.28 &gt;  0.0122. With p = 0.9, the values changed to P(y 
= 
1) = 0.9882 and P(y = 1) = 0.972 &lt; 0.9882, respectively. By 
and 
large, a (2/3)[.sup]3[/] recursive filter produced better 
values than those of a similar nonrecursive filter. References

  [Abstract] Reliable absolute calibration of microwave 
radiometers is critical to the solution of inverse problems of 
satellite-based passive microwave sensing. Two techniques are 
used for absolute calibration -- onboard calibration (which uses 
radiation either from manmade sources or from natural sources 
unrelated to the target being sensed, or both) and external 
calibration (which uses contrast areas of the Earth's surface). 
The sources in the first technique are called standards; those 
in the second technique, references. Since both techniques have 
merits and drawbacks, the researchers chose to combine their use 
in a technique based on precise knowledge of equivalent 
brightness temperatures of the standards and geophysical 
parameters of the reference areas. In the context of the 
estimation of accuracy associated with the determination of 
ocean-surface temperature and total water vapor mass in the 
atmosphere, they demonstrated that the new technique makes it 
possible to relax the requirements associated with onboard 
standards in achieving acceptable accuracy in determination of 
geophysical parameters. With external calibration based on 
reference areas alone, estimates of calibration factors were 
stabilized. When onboard standards were highly accurate, their 
use made it possible to raise the precision associated with the 
determination of absolute values of geophysical parameters.

  [Abstract] The Space-Based Natural-Resource and Ecological 
Research Section of the Russian Academy of Sciences Space 
Council met on 15 March 1993, in Moscow. The meeting was devoted 
to a discussion of the results of scientific research conducted 
aboard the Almaz-1 station and to the prospects of further 
research in the Almaz program. V. V. Viter, first deputy general 
designer at NPO Mashinostroyeniye gave the keynote speech, in 
which he recounted the history of the Almaz spacecraft, the 
first of which was launched on 25 July 1987, under the name 
Kosmos-1870. Almaz-1 lifted off some four years later, carrying 
an improved radar complex, whose resolution had been brought 
down to 10-15 m. The next in the series, Almaz-1B, is being 
readied for launch in 1996. The new spacecraft will carry a 
radar complex that consists of three sets with wavelengths of 
3.6 cm, 9.6 cm, and 70 cm. Resolution of the sets will be down 
to 5-7 m. The spacecraft will also be outfitted with 
high-resolution electrooptical equipment, spectroradiometric and 
electron-scanning gear in the visible and IR ranges, and a lidar 
set. It should be about five years ahead of similar craft in the 
West. Almaz-2, which is slated for launch in 1999, will be 
multifunctional in that it will study the Earth and its 
atmosphere and will serve to produce general models of the 
ocean-atmosphere system, global biosphere dynamics, and the 
effect of land energy budget on climate. Papers were read on the 
following programs: Briz (study of coastal waters and inland 
water bodies; identification of pollution sources); Geos-A 
(geoecological study; geological mapping; geological 
monitoring); Almaz-Agro (studies of soil fertility and crop 
conditions); Resurs-A (study of natural resources); Okean-I 
(development of radiophysical techniques for studying the ocean; 
study of propagation of surface and internal waves).

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Morgachev and Ilya Neyman: "The World </F>
Must Be Viewed From Above"; the first paragraph is an 
introduction and the last six paragraphs provide general 
information] 
  [Text] Images of the Earth's surface obtained by space 
monitoring, once of interest only to the military, have now 
become the object of an extremely large-scale business whose 
scope, according to a number of estimates, already exceeds a 
half-billion dollars. Monitoring data are valuable for 
organizations and enterprises engaged in exploration for and 
production of mineral resources, agriculture and the fishing 
industry. They are needed by all who are associated with 
ecological problems, prevention and elimination of the 
consequences of natural and man-induced catastrophes. 
  Space photographs, which "in color" are rather impressive, 
were on display at the International Exhibition "Oil and 
Gas-93," which ended yesterday in Moscow, including in displays 
of the Priroda and Soyuzkarta enterprises. The situation in the 
world market for these products is discussed by our reviewer 
Sergey Morgachev and our expert Ilya Neyman. 
<H5>  Photograph Business; Four Points of Reference </H5>
  Four factors can ensure success in this specific market: low 
costs for the launching and production of satellites, high 
quality of the images themselves (equipment resolution and a 
number of other special characteristics), high quality of 
equipment and technologies for the interpretation and processing 
of images and, finally, the presence throughout the world of a 
well-developed network of points for the reception and 
processing of telemetric information (this ensures routineness 
in the client receiving the desired product). In the first and 
second links of this chain Russia has completely competitive 
positions, in the third the situation is uncertain, but in the 
fourth Russian enterprises for the time being have not moved 
from the starting line. 
  Production costs and the cost of launching a payload into 
orbit in Russia, as is well known, are an order of magnitude 
below the world level. If one speaks of the equipment carried on 
satellites operated by civilian organizations, Russian 
technology has superior characteristics (see table). With 
respect to military satellites for visible reconnaissance, there 
are no precise data on Russian capabilities (the American 
photosatellite KN-11 ensures a resolution up to 15 cm, whereas 
the Lacrosse radar satellite ensures a resolution up to 60 cm). 
However, here it is not the technical level in general which is 
important, but the characteristics specifically of that 
equipment which is used for commercial purposes. According to 
the specifications of the Russian government (August 1992), for 
commercial purposes it is possible to use equipment with a 
resolution up to 2 m, which unquestionably will provide Russian 
users of this technology advantages in technical 
competitiveness. However, it is unknown how long this advantage 
will persist: in the United States the possibility of 
declassifying photographs with a resolution up to 1 m is already 
being considered. 
  The general backwardness of Russia in computer technology is 
greatly limiting its capabilities for creating image processing 
outfits. If one speaks of the processing of optical information, 
for the time being there are no alternatives to the use of 
imported equipment. The situation is more encouraging with 
respect to the processing of radar information: at the NPO ELAS 
a highly productive processor has been developed and already is 
in use in which a number of original technological solutions 
have been introduced. 
  The only Russian foreign terminal for the reception of 
satellite information is located, evidently, at the Military 
Technical Reconnaissance Center operated at Lourdes (Cuba), but 
it is only possible to make proposals on the incorporation of 
this terminal into commercial operations. 
<H5>  A Foreign Network Must Be Established </H5>
  Insofar as is known, in Russia there are now four 
organizations engaged in the processing and commercialization of 
satellite images: the Almaz enterprise (founder -- NPO 
Mashinostroyeniye, Reutov, Moscow Oblast), working with radar 
images from the Almaz station; the Sovinformsputnik enterprise, 
working with photographs from military satellites (founders -- 
Central Special Design Bureau, Samara, and two other government 
agencies which the authors promised not to mention); the AO 
Soyuzkarta (founders -- private individuals; this organization 
inherited the functions of the former VO of the same name) and 
the State Center Priroda as part of the Russian Federal Service 
for Geodesy and Cartography. Priroda and Soyuzkarta are 
commercializing photographs of satellites of the Resurs-F series. 
  The scales of activity of these enterprises constitute a 
commercial secret, but it can be assumed that real business for 
the time being is going on only at the latter two organizations, 
long concerned with this business and having the experience and 
the clientele. Taken together, with an optimistic estimate, 
their annual sales may now be about a half-million dollars. A 
primary product (copies of photographs) and its derivatives 
(photoplans, photomaps) are produced. As a rule reference is to 
a low degree of processing, although there also are orders for 
preparation of a complex product. The activity of 
Sovinformsputnik and Almaza for the most part is of a publicity 
nature and evidently their transactions do not exceed the limits 
of tens of thousands of dollars annually. In general, however, 
the share of Russia in the primary world market for satellite 
photographs and their derivatives in any case does not exceed 
1%. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USP-001C-17A>           World (primary, commercial) </FIG>




  There are several reasons for this. First of all -- the 
stiff 
opposition of American and West European competitors who control 
the market; this applies to both the sale of the "raw product" 
and to a still greater degree to the processed product (Russian 
enterprises began to work in the Western market only several 
years ago -- earlier their activity was restricted to the 
socialist countries). Second, the incompatibility of processing 
standards, making the sale of the processed material very 
difficult. Finally, the problem of a foreign network. 
Accordingly, the approach to success lies in the broad use of 
imported interpretation equipment and the adaptation of Russian 
analogues to Western technologies, agreement with Western 
partners on the organization of a unified network of surface 
complexes and changeover to work with information in digital 
form. And, finally, simply through stubborn marketing. This 
activity scarcely will bring success in Western Europe, where 
the influence of France and the United States is too great; the 
most likely chance is to exploit old and new connections in the 
developing countries. If Russia has pretenses to broadening its 
share in the world market, it must also incorporate the strictly 
technical trends in this sphere -- for example, the use of 
systems of light artificial earth satellites launched by light 
inexpensive boosters. Such a project is now being developed by 
the Alenia Spacio Company (Italy) and in Russia by the NPO 
Energiya.

  The optical equipment for satellite monitoring systems is 
produced in Russia by the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant (Moscow 
Oblast); development work is carried out by the State Optical 
Institute (St. Petersburg). The developers and producers of 
radar apparatus are the NPO Vega, Scientific Research Institute 
for Precise Instruments, Special Design Bureau EI (Moscow) and 
the NPO ELAS (Zelenograd). 
  What is Space Monitoring? It includes exploration for 
minerals; monitoring of the state of agricultural areas, 
forests, ice, the world ocean and its resources, and in general 
the state of ecosystems; warning of and elimination of the 
consequences of natural misfortunes (drought, floods, fires) and 
industrial catastrophes (tanker accidents, toxic effluent, etc.). 
  Monitoring is carried out using optical and radar apparatus 
aboard space vehicles. The information is "dumped" through radio 
channels to surface telemetric complexes or in the form of a 
film, passes through a greater or lesser number of computer 
processing stages and is trasmitted to the client, usually along 
communication lines in digital form. 
<H5>  Who's Who in the World Market </H5>
  The world market for space monitoring products is, according 
to approximate estimates, 50-100 million dollars annually. This 
is the primary market, that is, sales of companies which have 
access to the initial information from satellites. Their 
products pass through several processing stages and then the 
price may increase in comparison with the initial cost by an 
order of magnitude or more. As a result, according to estimates, 
the market attains 500 million dollars, although here there is 
evidently repeated recalculations involved. 
  In the market the leader is the French company Spotimage, 
operating the SPOT satellites. In contrast to the LANDSAT and 
ERS projects (see diagram), to a considerable degree oriented on 
the finalizing of technologies, the initiators of the SPOT 
project from the very beginning took measures for active 
advertising, establishment of a strong information-technical and 
commercial network. 
  If one reckons the final costs and revenues in this 
business, 
it is unprofitable: the expenditures on the development of 
satellites, their launching and operation, are too great. But 
the government (both in the United States, in France and in 
Russia), pursuing strategic goals, is assuming a large part of 
these expenses, which makes possible profitable operation of the 
commercial firms.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson: "Russian Cosmonautics: Ordered </F>
To Concentrate. The Need Has Arisen for Restructuring"] 
  [Text] A resolution of the government of the Russian 
Federation entitled "State Support and Protection of Space 
Activity in the Russian Federation," dated 11 December 1993, was 
published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on 11 January 1994 and thus was 
put into official force. 
  The resolution was adopted against the background of 
developing work on construction of the joint Russian-American 
orbital station, the Alpha. Finally, the Russian Space Agency 
(RSA), it appears, has found its place amidst the giants of 
national rocket building. From now on it is planned that all 
funding of the Russian Federal Space Program be through the RSA. 
For this purpose it is proposed that the agency be allocated an 
antedated 164.8 billion rubles for 1993, and for 1994 -- 274.8 
billion. Other than the RSA, only the military space forces are 
designated as users of space vehicles. 
  It must be said that considerable work on the development of 
the juridical base of national cosmonautics was carried out in 
the Commission on Communications, Information Science and Space 
("Adrov Commission") of the former Supreme Soviet. Without 
question the preparers of the new resolution made use of the 
accumulated experience. However, for the first time a number of 
interesting innovations are appearing in such a high official 
document. 
  Although the situation with the Baykonur cosmodrome has been 
normalized for some time and agreements have been reached with 
the Kazakhstan side and although the funding of the principal 
cosmodrome of the former USSR is especially provided for, the 
new document proposes to interested organizations that in a 
month's time they present to the government proposals on the 
further development of Russian Plesetsk and on establishing a 
new cosmodrome in the Russian Far East. 
  Thus, there has been official continuation of the 
"Blagoveshchensk Project." Since due to purely physical reasons 
it is possible to put considerably lesser loads into space from 
northern Plesetsk than from the lower latitudes, and since 
Baykonur seems none too attractive from the political point of 
view, the civilian and military rocket users of Russia are 
unified in their desire that something new be constructed. All 
the moreso since launchings of the heaviest (other than the 
stillborn Energiya) Russian rocket, the Proton, are impossible 
from the Plesetsk test range, making it is quite necessary to 
construct launch facilities. It is assumed that if they are to 
be built, it is better that it be done to the southeast. The 
spent stages in this case will fall in the ocean and the 
protests from Kazakh, Yakut and Nenets herders should probably 
cease. If two launch sites are constructed for Protons in the 
Blagoveshchensk region in the Far East, then naturally a 
duplicating center of Russian cosmonautics will take shape, 
taking into account the only station in Russia for the 
monitoring of distant space with the 70-m antenna at Ussuriysk 
and the reserve airfield for the Buran at Khorol. It is true 
that it is a long way to transport Protons from Moscow. 
  In addition to the Far Eastern project, there is the quite 
exotic project of the NPO Energiya, which has been kicked around 
in its time, the construction, on the basis of the model and 
similar to the Italian San Marco, of a floating platform for the 
launching of rockets from equatorial waters. The payload, to be 
sure, is increased, but there is a corresponding increase in the 
load on the long-suffering space budget. It is probably 
necessary to forget the platform for the time being. 
  Reading between the lines in the new documents, one can 
visualize the direction of further restructuring and 
concentration of national aerospace. Fully in accordance with 
market conditions an individual item provides for the allocation 
of preferred conversion credits for ensuring the production of 
technology in conformity to a specific list. If this list is 
comprehensive and if survival of the enterprises and 
organizations not included in the list is not contemplated, the 
fate of a number of facilities and projects becomes clear -- 
they will die. Reference, in particular, is to the construction 
of solid-fuel boosters, including those based on ballistic 
missiles from submarines (Machine Building Design Bureau at 
Miass in the Southern Ural); to the further production of the 
light Kosmos booster at the Omsk Polet Production Association; 
finally, to the Buran system and in general winged spacecraft. 
The Tushino NPO Molniya, building the Buran spaceplane, is not 
named in the list, but the Buran, together with the Energiya, on 
the other hand, were mentioned in a "requiem" press conference 
of Yuriy Koptev, RSA director, at the end of the year. The Buran 
is not to be. The only thing which can be recommended to the 
devotees of romantic spaceplanes is to await the opening of an 
elite restaurant in Gorkiy Park which will be placed aboard one 
of the Burans. 
  However, some of the projects will probably be taken over by 
the military. A number of their main organizations are not 
mentioned in the document, but without their support the 
projects are unlikely to survive. With respect to the "civilian 
segment," it is evident that the giant established by 
Academician Korolev, the NPO Energiya, now bearing his name, as 
before has a special status in Russian space plans. 
  Although the NPO (strictly speaking, it is unknown on whose 
initiative, up to now specific individuals are either 
dissociating themselves or whitewashing themselves after the 
fact) in my opinion has somewhat lost its initiative and dynamic 
character, in the mid-1970's getting itself involved in the 
venture with the Buran, the continuing cooperation with the 
American NASA on the orbital station is again advancing the 
enterprise at Podlipki into a privileged position. The several 
hundred million dollars to be received from the Americans is 
entirely comparable to the entire Russian space budget for a 
year or two. In addition, the NPO Energiya traditionally has 
carried out such functions and also has had such subdivisions 
which throughout the world have usually been regarded as 
governmental. The cosmonaut detachment, for example. Most of the 
directors of national cosmonautics and the military-industrial 
complex in general (including Aleksey Adrov, the former chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet commission, and Yuriy Baturin, the newly 
designated presidential assistant on national security) came 
from Podlipki. The latest resolution strengthens this special 
status even in details -- the next to the last item in the 
resolution allows the RSA to have the additional post of deputy 
general director. This post is set aside specially for Yuriy 
Semenov, the present-day general designer of the NPO Energiya. 
  Whatever you say, the structure of the space complex in 
Russia has taken on a monstrous form. Bad enough that a number 
of enterprises of the once unified military-space complex are 
now located abroad, primarily in the Ukraine, but also in 
Kirgizia and in Uzbekistan, not to mention Baykonur. The 
responsibility for clear-cut implementation of the government 
space program has been capriciously distributed between the 
state RSA and industrial enterprises (Energiya) which are being 
privatized. The very same American NASA, unquestionably a 
government agency, but having in its makeup very well-developed 
research and planning centers, is able to turn to private 
enterprises of the aerospace industry only with specific 
government orders. This is funded by a budget approved by the 
congress. Therefore, the time has come for a restructuring of 
the Russian space infrastructure. However paradoxical it may 
seem, the guardians of government interests in most cases are 
the directors and specialists of privatized 
scientific-production enterprises rather than a new generation 
of oversight people from state offices. It must be assumed that 
despite all the swingings of political vanes the hand on the 
pulse of Russian cosmonautics will continue to be held by the 
chief designers and the heads of design sections, and not only 
by managers and administrators. 
  Although many specialists, even at this same NPO Energiya, 
and particularly in the "outer circle," consider that it would 
be useful to establish a Russian NASA. This dream was mentioned 
once again during the monthlong period, but the dream evidently 
died on 11 January. It must be assumed that soon we will learn 
what direction the restructuring of national cosmonautics will 
take. It can be assumed that in Moscow, and probably in 
Krasnoyarsk (communication satellites), several federal space 
centers will be established, as stated in the resolution, for 
the concentration of efforts. 
  The legendary Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy prophesied the arrival 
from space of "mountains of grain and unlimited power." 
Present-day rocket specialists prefer a bird in the hand to two 
in the bush. It is best to remind our excessively pragmatic 
comrades once again how at one time such pragmatism forced 
Isabella of Castile to finance the voyage of Columbus.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Borodulin: "Space Expenditures Enter </F>
the Budget as a Separate Item. Oriented on Large-Scale 
Prestigious Manned Flights, Russian Cosmonautics May Repeat the 
Errors of the Soviets"] 
  [Text] The government of the Russian Federation, in 
approving the federal space program for the period up to 2000, 
allowed the RSA (Russian Space Agency) to make advance payment 
for purchase of standard space complexes in an amount of 
30% of 
their cost (as is the practice in the defense industry). The 
Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Finance in preparing 
the 1994 budget were told to put all space expenditures in a 
separate item. The RSA will receive 167 billion rubles of 
appropriations for research, development, testing and 
engineering work, 16 billion for the maintenance of surface 
services, 10 billion for capital construction and 81.8 billion 
for the purchase of standard- produced equipment. And in 1993 
(in actuality antedated) the branch was allocated 164.8 billion 
rubles. In essence this money represents the state debt for 
research, development, testing and engineering work already done 
and for purchased equipment, compensation for expenditures for 
the maintenance of cosmodromes, etc. A resolution of the 
Council of Ministers provides for preferred conversion credits 
for only 16 branch enterprises. Budgeted funding can only 
ameliorate, but not fundamentally improve the difficult 
financial situation of the RSA. The RSA is accordingly laying 
great hopes on cooperation with NASA and the ESA (European Space 
Agency). The agreement signed in December by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Albert Gore, jvice president of the United 
States, provides for the launching of the Russian-American 
orbital complex Alpha (in addition to work on the androgenous 
docking units and the joint manned flights in 1994-1997, which 
will cost 100 million dollars annually, etc.). In the words of 
Vladimir Pivnyuk, a government space expert, the American 
project for the launching of the Freedom orbital stations 
experienced a failure -- the Bill Clinton administration has 
sharply reduced the appropriations, although 10 billion dollars 
had already been invested in the project. A similar situation 
arose with our Mir 2 space station, all work on which was frozen 
due to an insufficiency of funding. The total value of the 
contracts under the Alpha project is 2 billion dollars, of which 
it is proposed that 400 million be allocated to the Russian 
side. The RSA has already received 1 million dollars from the 
Americans for the matching of interfaces (this program is part 
of stage I of work on the Alpha, also including joint flights in 
the Shuttle, construction of the Spektr and Priroda biomedical 
modules and putting them into orbit). In the second stage work 
will begin on assembly of the station, and in stage III -- its 
outfitting with special equipment. Yuriy Koptev, general 
director of the RSA, feels that work on the Alpha project in 
cooperation with NASA will be twice as cheap for our country 
than finalizing the Mir on our own efforts. These computations 
skirt a fundamental question -- is it necessary at all for 
Russia to participate in this project? In the opinion of many 
leading scientists (in particular, Academician Roald Sagdeyev 
has written about this more than once, about 97% of the 
research and practical information is from unmanned automatic 
vehicles; the contribution of manned flights to science is small 
and the contribution to the economy is virtually nil. Most 
likely Russia, recovering from the sharp criticism of purely 
prestigious space expeditions into orbit, will again return to 
this direction. The motives are understandable -- Russia wants 
to retain the personnel and technology of a powerful complex, 
and finally, the status of a great space power. But tactical 
advantages may be defeated by a strategic miscalculation which 
the USSR allowed many years ago -- concentrating its efforts on 
the race for the greatest duration of manned flights and the 
chalking up of records of little significance for science and 
the economy and disregarding the generous budgetary infusions 
the branch ignored commercial cosmonautics.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Baranovskiy: "TsAGI Has Reduced the </F>
Volume of Aircraft Tests By Two-Thirds. Foreign Aerospace Firms 
Provide One-Third of the Orders for the Largest Aviation 
Scientific Research Institute"] 
  [Text] The TsAGI (Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute) in 
Zhukovskiy in the Moscow region and its Moscow affiliate in the 
former USSR carried out virtually all the theoretical work and 
static tests of aviation technology. The institute has an 
entirely modern and the world's largest ensemble of wind tunnels 
(more than 60) for the wind tunnel testing of aircraft and their 
models. Now, when orders from the principal client, the Ministry 
of Defense of the Russian Federation, have ceased, the volume of 
these tests has been reduced by a factor of three. Research 
related to the Buran spaceship, for which TsAGI had constructed 
unique test stands such as even NASA does not have, has been 
stopped in its tracks. 
  Nevertheless, today the institute is supplied with resources 
adequate for carrying out research, development, testing and 
engineering work at the very highest technical level (40% 
of 
the TsAGI orders are received from the Russian space and defense 
industry, the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy and the 
Russian Space Agency, 27-30% of the work is funded by 
agreements with aviation design bureaus and the rest is earned 
by filling orders from foreign aerospace companies). 
  Among the foreign partners the first place is occupied by 
the 
Boeing Corporation, with which the institute has been 
cooperating since 1991. Major orders have been placed by French, 
but also by German, Indian, Japanese, South Korean and British 
companies (research on the An-226 "Mriya-Hotol" aerospace 
transport system has already been carried out in collaboration 
with British Aerospace for more than 2.5 years). 
  Cooperation with Chinese enterprises is developing in three 
directions: testing of models of civilian aircraft, 
modernization of the aerodynamic base of the Chinese People's 
Republic, reoutfitting of plants producing helicopters. 
  In the words of German Zagaynov, TsAGI director, there is an 
extremely high probability that some foreign producers of 
passenger aircraft will turn to the institute for carrying out 
tests and certifications of those planes which may be in demand 
in the Russian market. 
  The TsAGI also is developing industrial equipment for 
agriculture, fuel and energy complex branches, medicine and 
metallurgy. Solar cells for the heating of cottages enjoy a 
great demand. The institute has served as an organizer for 
establishing the "Regional Scientific-Industrial Association of 
the Southeast Moscow Region," which is concerned with the 
conversion of defense technologies. It is proposed that it will 
include aerospace enterprises located at Zhukovskiy, Ramenskoye, 
Lyubertsy, Lytkarino, Reutovo and Balashikha.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Chernyshov: "`Seriuses' Descend From </F>
Orbit. But Life in Orbit Continues"] 
  [Text] Once each of our space attainments was broadly 
discussed in the smallest detail. Now, probably, there are few 
who remember, other than relatives and workers in the 
corresponding services, that in orbit -- aboard the Mir station 
-- the "Siriuses" have already been working for several months: 
these are the cosmonauts Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr 
Serebrov. In the course of the first two weeks after the New 
Year a different crew will take up the servicing of the station. 
This time it will consist of three persons. Most likely the the 
inhabitants of the celestial dwelling will be Viktor Afanasyev, 
Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov. In the event of unexpected 
events three backup cosmonauts have been trained: Yuriy 
Malenchenko, Tolgat Musabayev and German Arzamazov. 
  In the course of the impending (number 15) main expedition 
the world record for spaceflight duration should be broken. The 
crews will include two physicians: Valeriy Polyarkov and German 
Arzamazov. They have long specialized on the problems involved 
in prolonged flights. They know the complexities associated with 
such expeditions. Valeriy Polyakov in the late 1980's already 
had spent 241 days aboard the station. Most likely he is to 
become a new space record holder. If everything goes as planned, 
the physician-researcher will work on the Mir not only during 
the entire fifteenth expedition, which is to end in June, but 
also on the next shift. A total of more than 420 days. 
  For what purposes are such complex experiments carried 
out? Sooner or later new flights will be made to the moon and 
Mars will be conquered. This means that it is necessary to know 
the capabilities of the human body. Well, among other things, it 
is assumed that such multisided research will advance 
fundamental science. Not so long ago in Arizona eight Americans 
spent two years in a closed surface complex. This was the major 
Biosphere 2 experiment. The American "bubble" is a gigantic -- 
measuring more than a hectare -- glass dome beneath which about 
4000 species of plants and animals were placed. The expected 
grandiose discoveries, as the specialists have written, for the 
time being have not been realized. Nevertheless, new research 
cycles under conditions of an almost closed biosphere are being 
planned. 
  Russian science leads with respect to space life support 
systems, today having the richest experience in individual 
record flights. This, incidentally, is one of the factors 
inciting the Americans and other Western countries to cooperate 
with us in the field of creating an international orbital 
station. In any case the American astronauts, not having the 
capability for particularly long flights on the Shuttles, 
already in the next few years are intending a total 24-month 
experiment with work under weightlessness conditions, 
participating in research on the Mir. 
  The agreements signed in December in Moscow by the Russian 
prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the American vice 
president Albert Gore signified, it is generally held, a 
changeover from the Mir program to the Alpha stage. According to 
the testimony of Daniel Goldin, NASA administrator, as a result 
of implementation of the project the United States will save 2 
billion dollars and approximately two years in the time required 
for construction of an international orbital station. The 
participants in the project, in addition to Russia and the 
United States, also will include the countries of Western 
Europe, Japan and Canada; they note that none of them 
individually could construct a station. Now there is definite 
evidence that the circle of participants in the project, as it 
is implemented, will possibly expand. The Alpha station, having 
the Mir 2 module as its basis, will gradually begin to be 
overgrown with other components, being transformed into a major 
orbital laboratory. The duration of its operation will be 
approximately from 1997 to 2010. 
  According to the testimony of Russian government and space 
experts, those 400 million which Russia will receive in the 
first stage of work on the project will facilitate us in keeping 
the now-operating Mir in a working state and second, to some 
degree will smooth out those "troughs" which were formed in the 
fairly long drawn-out restructuring of the Russian space 
industry. 
  Vladimir Pivnyuk, an expert of the government of the Russian 
Federation, is convinced that we have no need, for example, of 
keeping up nine gyroscope plants. Nowhere in the world does such 
a thing exist. This means that it is necessary to select only 
one such plant. But it must be supplied with the most modern 
equipment, supported by government orders. All the remaining 
enterprises must become joint stock companies. 
  A search for market niches both within the country and 
abroad, however, involves great difficulties. Only a very few 
companies, such as the Khrunichev plant, the NPO Energiya and 
Prikladnaya mekhanika (communication satellites), to some degree 
can ensure themselves with ruble and a very small hard currency 
earnings. There has been no broad entry of the Russian 
rocket-space industry into the external market. 
  An international air show has just been held at Bangalore, 
where great interest on the part of potential purchasers was 
manifested, in particular, in Russian military aircraft and 
helicopters. The Indian press writes in a considerably more 
restrained manner about Russian space technology. The cracks 
arising after the unsuccessful "cryogenic deal" still exist, 
India, convinced by local space experts, may rely only on their 
own boosters, such as the Agni rocket (in its capabilities it 
already is approximately equal to the American Pershing). A 
network of enterprises has been established in the country and 
includes more than ten plants and research centers. 
  The Russian side feels that the renewal of normal trade 
relations with India in the "space" field is possible; it is 
only necessary to adhere more strictly to the terms of the 
nuclear proliferation agreement. Without question, there must be 
a special competence in this sphere: both legal and juridical. 
In Russia a large excess of intermediate- and low-thrust rockets 
has been formed, including those which can operate from mobile 
launchers. The experts feel that there is a large market in the 
world for these rockets.

Leave Space Than to Remain"] 
  [Text] Should Belarus continue its participation in space 
research programs? An answer to this question has been sought in 
the republic for 1 1/2 years. Precisely for such a time our 
country, acquiring independence, has "twirled" the space 
heritage of the former union, not being able to make up its mind 
what to do. Not without hesitation was it decided to use it for 
its direct purpose. In other words, such resources were 
earmarked under the earlier signed Intergovernmental Program for 
Space Research and Use, which Belarus decided to carry out 
together with Russia, the Ukraine and other countries of the 
Commonwealth. 
  Boris Beregov, deputy director of the Technical Cybernetics 
Institute, Belarus Academy of Sciences, chairman of the republic 
conference on space, states: Only at first glance does it seem 
that getting out of the expensive space game means the saving of 
money. Over the course of many decades a unique 
scientific-industrial capability was formed in the republic 
which was oriented on the development and production of space 
systems, instruments and equipment for research on the Earth's 
surface and atmosphere and the solution of other technological 
and scientific problems related to the mastery of the universe. 
To break up the formed infrastructure, to seek a new place for 
application of the knowledge of specialists (most frequently 
with a very narrow field of specialization) and to redirect 
well-organized production to something else is possible only at 
an enormous cost. An example of this is the Gomel Electronics 
Plant. It is outfitted with the most modern equipment, including 
a supercomputer, and has specialists of the highest class who 
were brought together from the entire Union. Some mathematicians 
brought about a hundred families from the Novosibirsk 
Akademgorodok. And now they are mastering the production of 
lamps and other consumer goods! The Novopolotskiy Izmeritel 
plant, an enterprise which formerly was so secret and 
extraterritorial that not many even in the government of Belarus 
knew of its "space specialization," has found itself in a 
similar situation. A reasonable owner must not think about how 
to rid itself from what had been built up over the course of 
many years, but how to use this wealth in order to bring it 
income. Thank God we were able to convince the government of the 
republic of this. 
  Just what is the nature of the contribution of Belarus to 
the 
intergovernmental program? The most important contribution is a 
fractional participation in the funding of individual projects, 
the sequence of which is embodied in a special agreement. Sums 
will be allocated only for tasks to be performed by institutes, 
design bureaus and industrial plants in Belarus. 
  In addition to sums taken from budget appropriations for 
science, in accordance with the corresponding intergovernmental 
agreement, for the Belorussian share for maintenance of 
facilities in the space infrastructure, the government of 
Belarus has allocated money from the Ministry of Finance 
reserve. For this sum Belorussian standard-produced equipment 
and materials will be supplied for ensuring the normal operation 
of cosmodromes. Thus, jobs and production facilities will be 
preserved. 
  The program for Belarus includes 32 themes which the 
institutes and enterprises of the republic had begun to work on 
(and in most cases have simply continued). It must be noted that 
the program is being carried out jointly with the Russian Space 
Agency and this is so-called peaceful space. The military people 
have their own cooperation and their own plans. 
  With respect to Russia, it is interested in such a joining 
of 
efforts: for the development of such research it would require 
not only additional appropriations, but also three or four years 
for organizing corresponding scientific groups and bringing them 
up to an acceptable level. Well, what is the interest of Belarus 
in this? Is it only striving to preserve its space intellectual 
and production capabilities or is it also counting on some 
return? 
  "To be sure, we are counting on a return," explains Boris 
Beregov. "It must not be forgotten that our republic is in a 
more advantageous position because the principal financial 
burden for space is not on our shoulders. Much of that which is 
being done in the space field moreover is of a purely national 
character and is directed to satisfaction of our own needs. In 
addition, today possibilities are appearing for making formerly 
secret technologies available to `nonspace' production 
facilities, which also will bring an economic return. 
  In agriculture, for example, a space survey includes a 
high-quality evaluation of the condition of soils and monitoring 
of the fertilization of plants, as well as more successful 
contending with weeds and predators and reproachless monitoring 
of the development of sown crops and calculation of yields by 
species. 
  Belarus has everything necessary for the processing of 
satellite information. It is only necessary to organize this 
work into a system. The first steps in this direction have 
already been taken. But it is the opinion of scientists that 
serious work will be possible only with the appearance of a 
satellite information center and with the raising of this entire 
service to a state level."

Accent"] 
  [Text] The Ukraine wants to be in space. It has all the 
prerequisites to make a breakthrough into space. We have the 
Yuzhnoye Design Bureau at Dnepropetrovsk and the Yuzhmash, which 
is known to just about everyone. There are many of its special 
facilities with different capabilities, a National Space Agency 
has been established and there is a fairly good record of 
scientific accomplishments. In the not distant future plans call 
for putting a Ukrainian satellite, the "Sich," into orbit. There 
is least of all any desire to be exotic or to surprise the 
world. What is most important is the implementation of a 
grandiose project for remote sensing of the Earth. 
  "Recently the method for aerospace monitoring of the state 
of 
the environment is being used more and more widely," says Vadim 
Lyalko, corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences, director of the Center for Aerospace Study of the 
Earth of the Geological Sciences Institute, Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences. The scientists of the Ukraine, within the framework of 
the "Ukrkosmosresursy" and "Kosmos" projects, have developed and 
tested original methods and equipment which during sensing in 
the ranges from ultraviolet to microwave make it possible to 
solve many ecological problems. These include, for example, an 
estimate of water saturation of the soils, rise of the water 
table and salinization of soils, detection of active fault 
zones, sectors of damage to oil, gas, heat and water pipelines, 
lands and water bodies polluted by heavy metals, nitrates and 
petroleum products, search for underground water sources, 
oil-gas and ore deposits, weather prediction and much else. For 
the complete space monitoring of the Ukraine it is necessary 
that the photographs carry multisided information on the 
geoecological state both of its territory and the territories of 
other countries. The members of the Scientific Council for Study 
of Natural Resources by Remote Methods, Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences, are dreaming of the implementation of such a project. 
  Right now, however, as reported by V. Lyalko, specialists on 
remote sensing of the Earth have gone further. A survey from a 
satellite, even our own, is still not enough. In order to have 
complete information it is necessary to establish a network of 
surface stations for the reception and processing information 
because geoecological conditions constantly change. Accordingly, 
within the framework of the national space program five centers 
are being established, each of which will carry its own 
functional load. The developers were supported by the government 
of the Ukraine, purchasing and distributing modern computers and 
processing equipment to the centers. Surface stations have 
received the capability, for the time being in research and 
experimental modes, for testing space information processing 
methods. The work is held back by the fact that it is necessary 
to "hire" satellites from Russia and the United States and these 
services are expensive. But in the future, when the 
"surface-space-surface" ring is closed, the routine information 
collected by the "Sich" satellite will certainly become as 
necessary as statistics. The developers, like all the people, 
are dreaming and ideally see a picture such as this: at each 
oblast center (initially, but later in a still denser network) 
there will be a display from which specialists will receive not 
only necessary information on the geoecological state of the 
region, but also recommendations on the adoption of decisions in 
the case of accidents, calamitous events, etc. 
  For the time being the project can be carried out only to 
the 
extent that funding or the availability of a material base 
allows. However, foreign countries also are highly interested in 
these "scraps." Professor Lyalko stated that fairly good 
cooperation is being organized with American and French 
specialists and the Arab countries, for example, have been 
interested in the end product of routine remote sensing. Israel 
would not mind receiving assistance from the Ukrainians in the 
search for deep (up to 100 meters) water. To put it briefly, 
cash on the barrel head is being asked. It remains to get it, 
that is, for developing and introducing unprecedented technology. 
  However, the mastery of space by oneself is an expensive and 
slow business. The cooperation of countries here has very good 
possibilities. Understanding this, specialists at the Center for 
Aerospace Study of the Earth are striving to organize mutually 
advantageous contacts with Russia and other foreign partners. 
Together with Russian colleagues and with the participation of 
scientists in the United States and ten other countries in the 
world the Ukrainians are working on the implementation of the 
very interesting "Priroda" project. It provides that in late 
1994-early 1995 a module with the most modern and perfected 
instrumentation will be constructed which will link up with the 
Mir orbital station and with which with time a solution will be 
found for mankind's problems of space monitoring of the Earth.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Tomashevskaya: "Will Space Yield </F>
Dividends?"] 
  [Text] Space research in Belarus is under the direction of 
the Technical Cybernetics Institute, Belarus Academy of 
Sciences. At first glance at the interior of the institute you 
feel a slight disenchantment: the old walls and the decrepit 
furniture have nothing in common with those nickel-plated, shiny 
Hollywood surroundings which you involuntarily visualize when 
the word "space" is mentioned. However, one should not be 
surprised by the fact that heroic figures in spacesuits are not 
strolling along the corridors of the institute in spacesuits, 
but by the fact that Belarus space has received state funding at 
all. This happened this autumn. The first funds, allocated by 
the Belarus government for four months of research, by space 
standards was modest: 350 million rubles. 
  Boris Beregov, the deputy director of the institute, 
chairman 
of the republic Space Council, had few hopes for that. This, to 
be sure, has not been reflected in that uncommon stubbornness 
with which he has confronted all possible government agencies, 
striving to obtain support for the ill-understood, costly and 
little-profitable program. Under the conditions prevailing in 
impoverished Belarus Boris Beregov achieved the most significant 
miracle. 
  Despite the existence of a republic council, for the time 
being there is neither a centralized leadership nor a uniform 
clear-cut program for the several institutes, enterprises and 
laboratories working in this field. They all, independently of 
one another, are engaged in development work, approximately half 
of which is for the needs of the republic and half for 
participation in the CIS intergovernmental program for 
investigation and use of space. 
  The Soviet Union and Europe have carried out parallel 
military development work which later, also in a parallel 
fashion, has experienced conversion. As a result, in some 
respects our level was higher, in other respects that of the 
West was, but neither Europe nor America in the immediate future 
will become our clients. 
  With respect to third countries, they (such as the recently 
arriving Indians) have already expressed their interest in 
Belarus research. However, as Beregov acknowledges, this is 
inadequate for the sale of our developed products -- it is 
necessary to broaden and somehow further improve our products. 
  The production relationships of the countries of the former 
USSR, which are linked to ours, is a different matter. They have 
proposed the purchase of systems developed in Belarus, which are 
inexpensive in comparison with European products. In addition, 
the specialists who are installing, repairing and adjusting 
equipment are readily available. We, in turn, are interested in 
the former Soviet republics for the very same reasons. Around 
Beregov's desk, as in the good old days, there is a gathering of 
Russian, Ukrainian, Baltic, Uzbek, Turkmen and Tajik specialists. 
  Belarus scientists are participating in the work of the CIS 
Intergovernmental Space Council. Its activity is organized on 
the principle of the European Space Agency. All the countries 
participating in one project or another are contributing 
resources to it proportional to their gross national product. 
But money is not being directed to some abstract treasury, but 
to research in one's own territory. For example, funding was 
recently obtained for the work of the Institute of Heat and Mass 
Exchange of the Belarus Academy of Sciences for study of the 
thermal insulation of satellites and spaceships. Providing the 
Russian agency with their results, our specialists receive 
information on the research carried out in other countries which 
are members of the agency. Now there is partial funding for work 
on developing the MK-94 multiband camera for satellites of the 
Resurs system and payment is being received for work on 
developing special apparatus for studying the ozone layer. 
  And nevertheless, what reason does Belarus, with its 
poverty, 
have for spending money on space? After all, government 
expenditures on space research are not paying for themselves in 
any, even superhighly developed country of the world. 
  "In actuality, such research seems suspicious to all who 
recognize only direct profit," says B. Beregov. "They do not 
understand that by not sensing the Earth's surface more is lost 
than is saved in the funding of this work. When in the spring 
the Pripyat has overflowed and the Polesye has been inundated, 
the only thing which we could do, insofar as I know, was to go 
out into the disaster regions and estimate the inflicted losses. 
But if we had organized a systematic procedure for the 
collection of information from special radar satellites it would 
be possible to trace in advance how the water is spreading and 
accordingly, make predictions. Proceeding on the basis of this 
information, the government would take measures knowing 
precisely what had to be done: construct dams or dig trenches, 
relocate or not relocate the people." 
  Using satellites it is possible to predict the weather and 
crop yields, find minerals and evaluate ecological conditions. 
Incidentally, the sole space research in Belarus in which the 
entire world is interested is probably related to the 
consequences of Chernobyl. Having survived the accident, we 
became a unique region where it is possible to monitor the 
fission of radionuclides, their propagation and their effect on 
the environment. 
  "With what is space science in Belarus now occupied?" 
  "We have developed special system for processing the 
information received in sensing the Earth. After all, it is 
insufficient simply to have photographs in our hands. In order 
to assess the content of an image it is necessary to use special 
mathematical methods. We are buying equipment and developing 
mathematical methods and technologies for the processing of 
images and are adapting equipment for solving definite problems. 
We are doing all this by order either of organizations in 
Belarus or those countries which are interested in such work."

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin, under the rubric "Cooperation </F>
Between Russian and the US in Space": "Russia Intends To Work 
Out an Equitable Partnership"; first paragraph is source 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian-American collaboration in space is 
gradually moving to a plane in which specific projects are being 
undertaken. During the U.S. visit that was wrapped up at the end 
of last week -- a visit by the Russian Space Agency (RSA) 
delegation, which was headed by the agency's director, Yuriy 
Koptev -- a detailed plan was coordinated for the creation of an 
international space station, which for now is being called 
Alpha. That plan was made public by the RSA head at a press 
conference yesterday, and it will go into effect after the 
signing of the agreement in December, when U.S. Vice President 
Al Gore visits Moscow. At the same time, the RSA and the 
American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
will conclude a similar agreement, as well as a basic contract 
worth $350-370 million. 
  The new plan will replace two projects that existed 
independent of each other -- the American Freedom project, which 
in fact was closed down because of financial difficulties, and 
the Russian Mir-2, which Russia, too, lacks the money to 
complete by itself. Mr. Koptev noted that the participation in 
the creation of the Alpha station will be 2- to 2.5-fold cheaper 
for Russia than would the Mir-2 project. The first stage alone 
of the creation of Alpha (in which the Russian Protons and the 
American Shuttles will deliver to the Mir station additional 
equipment, and in which joint flights of Russians and Americans 
will take place) will enable Russian enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex to receive contracts worth $400 
million. The U.S. administration has promised to allocate that 
money to pay for the services of Russian firms in 1995-1997. In 
the second and third stages (the station is to be completed by 
the year 2001), the RSA head estimated that the figure may grow 
to $900 million. The plan, signed by the heads of the RSA and 
NASA in Washington, has already been sent for review to Congress 
and to the Russian government. 
  Mr. Koptev brushed aside the fears that the Americans would 
be the proprietors of the station. Russia is contributing to the 
project its own technologies and services, and, in his opinion, 
the overall balance will be in favor of Russia. In addition, the 
head of the RSA is convinced that the project itself is 
impossible without the equal participation of Russia in the 
creation of the station. It's true that for now, Russia is 
participating in it only as a partner. The European governments, 
as recently as October, were reviewing the question of the equal 
participation of Russia -- a final decision is to be issued in 
early December, and it is expected to be positive. Apparently, 
the Europeans are supported by their colleagues, the heads of 
the Japanese and Canadian space agencies, which, on the basis of 
the intergovernmental agreements of 1988 and the bilateral 
agreements of those agencies with NASA, are regarded as equal 
participants in the project for the international space station. 
  Russia must also resolve a number of specific questions with 
the European [Space] Agency regarding, for example, the flights 
of European astronauts on the Mir station. As for another aspect 
of the participation of Russia in international space programs 
--commercial launches of satellites -- Mr. Koptev noted that 
there are already a number of precontract proposals -- 
specifically, for the launch of the European satellite Astra 
atop the Proton launch vehicle. The Lockheed firm will handle 
the marketing for that.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. I. Sevastyanov, USSR pilot-cosmonaut, </F>
twice Hero of the Soviet Union, and USSR State Prize laureate, 
by Valentina Nikiforova: "Once He Told a Parable"; first 
paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] Vitaliy Ivanovich Sevastyanov -- twice Hero of the 
Soviet Union, USSR pilot-cosmonaut, and USSR State Prize 
laureate. Little mentioned, but such dear, splendid titles. And 
a recent title -- people's deputy of Russia. And the current 
title --candidate for people's deputy of the Federal Assembly, 
and together with G. Zyuganov and V. Ilyukhin, he is heading the 
list of the preelection association, the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation. 
  PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, you saw with your own 
eyes the tragic end of the Supreme Soviet. And once again, 
you're going into politics. Why? Because of dissatisfaction with 
your personal life and your social position, or because of a 
desire to be high profile? 
  Sevastyanov: I'll tell you frankly: out of a sense 
of social responsibility. And four years ago, which I plunged 
into my first preelection campaign, I was doing it with that 
same sense. I didn't have any experience in politics, I just 
learned it as I went. I knew this: the most important thing is 
to be honest. Now after three and a half years of work in the 
Supreme Soviet, I feel an acute need to use the platform of the 
highest organ of representative authority to explain to the 
people where we're being taken and what lies ahead. 
  PRAVDA: You could explain without being a member 
of parliament. You have fame and authority. 
  Sevastyanov: But the possibilities are 
considerably fewer. And the main thing is that in parliament, 
you can have a direct effect on the fate of Russia, that is, the 
actual possibility of either adopting or rejecting a given law. 
And just look at how many harmful laws we've managed to reject! 
For example, when they were discussing the legislation on 
jurors, I told a parable. One great visionary brought to his 
country a sundial, and the people learned what time it was. They 
began to appreciate time, they worked better, and the country 
flourished. The people idolized the dial and decided to erect a 
temple to it. They raised the walls, and then imbricated the 
cupola. The sun went away, the shadow disappeared, and the dial 
didn't work. The people lost track of time and again became 
disorganized -- devastation came, and the country fell apart. 
  The parable was timely. Seven percent voted for the law on 
jurors. There it is -- with a majority you can make sensible 
decisions. The parliament, after all, is not simply a publicist 
platform -- it's a platform for unification and for promoting a 
sense of social responsibility for the future of the country 
among deputies of varying political persuasion. 
  PRAVDA: What would you like to start your work in 
the State Duma with? 
  Sevastyanov: With a reform of the government. I 
don't know when the Duma is to assemble, but that has to be done 
right away. Second, the course of the reforms has to be adjusted 
in order to stabilize the economic and political situation. 
Otherwise, a social explosion is unavoidable. And third, 
perhaps, is parallel to the first two steps -- restore the 
Fundamental Law (the Constitution) and the laws that were 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet. The state is the law. If there's 
no law, there will be repression. 
  PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, do you still have ties 
with NPO Energiya? 
  Sevastyanov: Of course. I'm still in the cosmonaut 
corps. I work as an instructor and as an experimenter-cosmonaut. 
We have these slots: a plain cosmonaut, an 
experimenter-cosmonaut, and a researcher-cosmonaut. In terms of 
work experience and length of service, there are cosmonaut 
candidate, cosmonaut, and cosmonaut instructor. And since I've 
long been an experimenter in the cosmonaut corps, I hold an 
instructor's position. 
  PRAVDA: Has the political and economic instability 
also had an effect on the space program, a sector that is so 
favored by the public, is prestigious, and is, in fact, 
profitable? Has it affected the Energiya association. Or have 
they noted no changes there -- things going the way they always 
did? I mean, our people are still going aloft. Could it be that 
the talk of difficulties is just a matter of habit, to get a 
little more from the state for the growth of the sector? 
  Sevastyanov: What? No changes? The funding for the 
space program has been cut by more than 60 percent. The funding 
difficulties have forced us to let go several thousand of the 
most skilled specialists from the enterprise. 
  PRAVDA: Several thousand? 
  Sevastyanov: Yes, several thousand. In our sector, 
38 percent of the candidates of science and doctors of science 
have been let go; they went to commercial structures or went 
abroad. The Mir station, which has already worked through three 
service lives, exists and operates to this day as a result of a 
colossal repair-and-restoration program. But it can't last 
forever. And they haven't put up a new station -- there's no 
money. And if the funding isn't opened up in the near future, 
our consistent work in space will cease. 
  PRAVDA: And that's why it is with such sadness 
that we recall past records and feats. You, after all, went into 
space for the first time in 1970, right? 
  Sevastyanov: With Andriyan Nikolayev. Aboard 
Soyuz-9. We were aloft for 18 days. At that time, after the 
five-day missions, that was the first long-duration mission; it 
was an absolute world record for three and a half years, and, in 
that class of spacecraft, it is a world record to this day. The 
second time I went aloft was with Petr Klimuk, aboard the 
Soyuz-18, in 1975; we docked with the Salyut-4 orbital station. 
We saw the Soyuz-Apollo docking -- we were 110 kilometers above 
them. And then we returned to the ground after them. 
  PRAVDA: You were born in the Urals and finished 
school in Sochi. What brought about such a change in location? 
  Sevastyanov: In December 1945, my father was 
demobilized, and he took me and my mother to Kuban. At first we 
lived in Maykop, and then in 1948 we moved to Sochi. My parents 
stayed there. My father died five years ago, and my mother 
didn't want to move away. 
  PRAVDA: Did your father ever tell you stories 
about the front? 
  Sevastyanov: Of course. He left on the third day. 
And spent the entire war in the same 150th Separate Tank Brigade 
of the High Command Reserve. He fought on several fronts -- near 
Konev, near Zhukov. He finished the war in Prague. 
  PRAVDA: Did he hold a high rank? 
  Sevastyanov: He was an ordinary enlisted man -- 
senior sergeant. He drove a tank the whole war. He had the full 
set of enlisted man awards. That's the history of my father and 
his fellow soldiers, and I won't allow it to be defiled. That's 
why I've volunteered to defend the CPSU in the Constitutional 
Court. 
  PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, you're being asked 
about a lot of things in the preelection meetings. But I would 
like to ask about the logo of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation in the elections: a crisp, elegant drawing of the 
hammer and sickle is surrounded by the words "Russia. Fairness. 
Labor. Power to the People." 
  Sevastyanov: The person behind the logo is the 
science-fiction artist Andrey Sokolov. I've known him for some 
25 years, since he first entered the cosmonaut corps, in which 
Aleksey Leonov worked. The logo is rectangular. You won't get it 
mixed up with any other.

<F P=106> [Article by Lev Kamanin, candidate of technical sciences, </F>
docent, and instructor at the Military Air Academy imeni N. Ye. 
Zhukovskiy, under the rubric "Documents": "Theft in Orbit, Or 
How Our `Space Achievements' Are Being Put Onto the World 
Market"; figure of possible configuration of international 
station not reproduced here] 
  [Text] The crisis situation in our aerospace industry, 
which has been cast to the whims of fate by the Russian 
government, is approaching a point beyond which its resurrection 
will, in the near future, be impossible. We're reassured by the 
fact that the Russian Space Agency, in attempting to avert an 
impending catastrophe, has managed some big successes in the 
commercialization of that most important sector of the 
military-industrial complex. 
  According to the American-Russian agreement that has been 
adopted, Russia, until the end of the century, can conclude no 
more than one contract a year for the launch of geostationary 
satellites, whereas contracts for the launch of low-orbit 
satellites must be examined on a case-by-case basis. U.S. 
businessmen are taking care of Russia's revenues: the payout for 
each commercial launch of the Proton vehicle cannot be lower 
than 92.5 percent of the price asked for similar launches by 
U.S. or Western European companies. 
  U.S. congressmen and representatives are playing the role of 
"good patrons," supposedly defending Russian interests against 
the encroachments of the "bad Western European merchants." The 
latter guys, of course, are not ecstatic about the attempts of 
the "Russian agency" to enter the "trade ranks" on the world 
space market. But the Americans, in turn, are concerned about 
the considerable share held by Western Europe in the revenues 
from commercial launches of satellites, while, in their view, 
their own share is small (at 35 percent). That is why the United 
States is striving to dictate its own strict requirements for 
the conclusion of trade deals to its new competitors, as well as 
to its old competitors. Assistant U.S. Commissioner for Trade 
Peter Olzier [Olzhiyer] declared this: "Representatives of 
Western Europe are trying to coordinate an agreement that 
determines such rules (essentially, fettering for Russia and 
other potential competitors -- L. Kaminin), with simplification 
of the procedure for producing with them sanctions of the 
American government against launches." 
  What kinds of revenues are stipulated for us in that 
agreement? Russian Space Agency director Yuriy Koptev says that 
participation in commercial launches of launch vehicles and the 
sale of aerospace hardware will being Russia no less than 
$200-220 million a year. Is that a lot? We know that in 1992, 
the worldwide total for revenues from the commercial use of 
space hardware reached $13.2 billion. With that, the revenues 
from the use of launchers did not exceed $1.2 billion, that is, 
10 percent of the total revenues. That means that the country 
that was the first to open the path to space will be allowed to 
receive for offering its launchers no more than one-sixtieth of 
the worldwide total of "space revenues." And that until the end 
of the century. 
  Against the backdrop of that "space theft" announced 
beforehand, the ultimatum presented by the United States to 
Russia in connection with the contract concluded in 1991 for the 
delivery to India of cryogenic motors for a measly $2 million 
simply pales. And yet it is in force. True, that was only after, 
in exchange for refusing the little blue bird in the hand -- the 
agreement to "freeze" the contract with India -- they promised 
us the crane in the sky: they promised to better the chances of 
Russia to participate in the building of the Freedom orbital 
station. 
  President Clinton approved a limit of $10.5 billion for the 
spending associated with the creation of the Freedom station up 
to the end of the 20th century. Russian Prime Minister V. 
Chernomyrdin, as he was departing recently for talks in the 
United States, announced that the participation of Russia in the 
realization of the Freedom project will enable the Americans to 
"earn" more than $2 billion. The prime minister was modestly 
quiet about how much we would earn. Either he was hiding that 
intentionally, or he didn't know what we would earn. 
  But in the words of Yu. Koptev, we will be paid $600-700 
million for the help Russia will give the United States in 
building the station. We should note that if a joint three-way 
project is adopted, a good half of the station modules will be 
units being developed for our future Mir-2 station, whereas the 
American laboratory will take up no more than one-fourth of the 
total space of the structure. 
  Why, we ask, do we place such a low price on our labor and 
our scientific and technical achievements? After all, the 
minimum cost of the American "quarter" of the future station is 
estimated by U.S. specialists to be $10.5 billion, whereas the 
Russian "half," if we are to believe our prime minister, is only 
$2 billion, which is saved by the Americans as a result of the 
use of Mir-2 units. And why, if we are to believe Mr. Koptev, 
will we be able to get only a third of that clearly understated 
amount? 
  You arrive at some uncomfortable conclusions. Neither the 
Western European wholesale space merchants, nor our transoceanic 
patrons are really burning with the desire to have another 
competitor on the "free and uncontrolled" market for space 
technologies and services. And that's why, in the discussion of 
joint plans and programs of cooperation in space, they're 
addressing us not as equal partners, but as poor relatives 
patiently awaiting the next pittance from a bar stool.

"Dreaming About the High Heavens, TsAGI Is Busy Making Its Own 
Boots"] 
  [Text] Throughout its entire 75-year history, the N. Ye. 
Zhukovskiy Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) -- the 
leader and head institute of domestic aircraft building -- has 
been proud of its contribution to "everything that flies in the 
skies over our country." Today, it is concerned with its needs 
on the ground. 
  Things are not easy in the current conditions for the one 
who 
for so long was the country's favorite brainchild, to whom 
nothing was refused, and whose requests were a top priority. In 
the years of shortages, lines, and product cards, Zhukovskiy's 
aviation center was in no need "in the field" or at home. Now 
TsAGI is learning not only to count money, but also to earn it. 
  Before, fundamental scientific advances, high-tech aerospace 
hardware, and defense products were fully ordered, financed, and 
used by the state. Now, in crisis conditions, the state accounts 
for only 40 percent of the TsAGI budget. The actual situation, 
in the estimation of TsAGI director German Zagaynov, is that, in 
the near future, society will be unable to support a 
considerable portion of the intellectual potential and high-tech 
research that have been accumulated. 
  The problem is not just in the expensiveness of a commodity 
whose affordability is limited to only the state or, in the 
extreme, large firms who need the product. TsAGI's misfortune is 
that it used to be far in the lead in the technical standards of 
our society, which is still incapable of making skillful and 
full use of the scientific-technical wealth created in the 
institute. The institute has to survive on its own: the state 
hasn't proposed any special conversion programs or any policy 
stimulating internal or foreign investment to support basic 
research. 
  With Russian partners, TsAGI has built and is the proprietor 
of a factory that has already begun series manufacture of ... 
men's and women's shoes. All the staff members of the institute 
will, within a year, be shoed in boots of their own making. 
Other commercial enterprises that have been created at TsAGI and 
that produce metal tiles, lining panels, mixers, ceramic dishes, 
lamps, wood-drying chambers, etc., are also operating 
successfully. 
  A special commercial-conversion service has been created in 
the institute to coordinate the new types of activity. It 
organizes investment and holding companies and institute banks 
and insurance structures; it sets up shareholding; and it is 
involved in privatization. The funds attracted in connection 
with contracts with domestic industry represents 27-30 percent 
of the institute's budget today. 
  TsAGI's commercial activity is not just a means of becoming 
independent in the absence of the customary trusteeship of the 
state. It is a means of saving its unique personnel from being 
sold off as state orders are cut back and wages drop to low 
levels (they are more than twofold lower than the average in the 
country). Overall, over 5-6 years, up to 30 percent of the 
institute's staff members are expected to be hired by contract. 
The fall of 1993 saw the introduction of a system of grants for 
young specialists who are developing promising advances, wages 
increases of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles [R] for those who enter 
master's programs, and awards of a half a million rubles for who 
defend their dissertation. 
  In the opinion of German Zagaynov, to survive, the economy 
today needs "monsters" -- powerful multiprofile, multifunctional 
corporations capable of combining science and applications, 
i.e., basic advances, experimentation, and production. That is 
why, at the initiative of TsAGI, the Association of Aerospace 
Enterprises and Institutions of the Southeastern region of 
Moscow Oblast was formed in October of this year. The operating 
program of that consortium involves not only conversion measures 
capable of creating and maintaining new markets, but also the 
solution of a long-existing, painful problem -- how to raise the 
standards of production rapidly. 
  The initiators of the project feel that it can become a 
fragment of the scientific-industrial policy of Russia and that 
it will at the same time make it possible for the institute to 
"become integrated into the region, work for it, and get results 
from the region." There is a hope that the regional corporation 
will help to develop and transform for the internal and external 
market TsAGI's high-level technologies, which, in return, will 
give to the institute its former high professional standing and 
to Russia, an economic dynamism, a high standard of living, and 
prestige in the world.

"TsAGI and NASA Have Signed a Memorandum on Cooperation: The 
American Side Is Interested in the Russian Intellect and 
Technologies"] 
  [Text] A delegation of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) visited Moscow for a working meeting with 
officials of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) and 
in connection with the anniversary celebrated by its TsAGI 
colleagues. The head of the delegation, Wesley Harris -- the 
deputy director of NASA -- is the immediate head of all four of 
its research centers. The intensive two-day talks between Harris 
and the deputy chairman of the State Committee on Defense 
Sectors of Industry of Russia, Anatoliy Bratukhin, resulted in a 
memorandum on cooperation between Russia and the United States 
in the field of basic aviation research. 
  The document is to serve as one of the appendices in an 
agreement on cooperation between Russia and the United States 
that is supposed to be signed on 16 December 1993 at a meeting 
between Vice President Albert Gore and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. On behalf of the Russian government, the appendix 
will be countersigned by the chairman of the State Committee on 
Defense Sectors of Industry, Viktor Glukhikh. The document is to 
expand the possibilities for joint work that were alluded to in 
the August agreement on cooperation in space. 
  It will be primarily TsAGI and the Central Institute of 
Aviation Materials (VIAM) that will actively interact with NASA 
on the research program outlined. 
  The American partners are interested primarily in the 
Russian 
intellectual potential, our methods of basic research, and a 
number of "high-level technologies" that, in the United States, 
are less effective or don't exist at all. 
  For TsAGI, in the words of its director, German Zagaynov, 
the 
signing of the agreement during the anniversary was profoundly 
symbolic -- the document was initialed in the same room in which 
A. N. Tupolev designed his first airplanes.

<F P=106> [Article by Petr Yevseyev, FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA </F>
correspondent: "International Spaceport Uses Russian Technology"] 
  [Text] Russian space industry is receiving a chance for 
strengthening its positions in the world and broadening its 
share in the commercial launches market. The directors of the 
key enterprises of the national space complex in November were 
familiarized with the sites of the proposed construction of a 
new international privately operated spaceport. It will be 
located on one of the islands of Papua-New Guinea and Russian 
specialists will play the leading role in its construction. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-USP-001C-30A>           nnot&gt; Key: 1. Equator 2. Papua-New Guinea </FIG>



  The idea of establishing a spaceport arose in Australia and 
initially its construction was proposed precisely there, on Cape 
York. However, in the course of elaborating the project the 
Space Transportation Systems (STS) concern, organized for this 
purpose, came to the conclusion that it was more feasible to 
construct it in Papua-New Guinea. The islands proposed by the 
government of this country are closer to the equator (Emirau 
Island -- 1 degree 40 minutes from the equator, Manus Island -- 
2 degrees) and make it possible to increase the mass of the 
payload put into a geostationary orbit by a Proton booster by 
more than double. 
  In March five of our enterprises signed a preliminary 
agreement with the STS. The Australians are taking upon 
themselves the concerns about the financing of the project and 
construction, together with Papua-New Guinea, of the 
infrastructures of the future spaceport. Our task is supplying 
technological equipment for the spaceport and the performance of 
the principal assembly work. 
  Five years ago, when the idea of the construction had just 
come up, American, French and British companies offered their 
services. However, Russia was selected as the principal partner 
and the Zenit first, and then the Proton, was selected as the 
basic booster. Nikolay Pismennyy, department head at the Main 
Administration for Rocket and Space Technology of the State 
Committee for Industrial Defense Branches, attributes such a 
choice to the fact that the Proton is now the most reliable and 
has the greatest capabilities of any rocket in the world. This 
booster has been launched more than 200 times. 
  Under the agreement, by the end of the first half-year of 
1994 the Design Bureau for General Machine Building, with the 
participation of other Russian enterprises, should have 
developed a rough draft of the spaceport. It is proposed that 
the first launch of a booster from the new spaceport will take 
place in 1998. 
  The work done by our companies will be paid for at once, 
regardless of the further operation of the constructed 
spaceport. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of the 
spaceport will be from 900 million to 1 billion dollars. Half 
will be the cost of the technological equipment and half will be 
the cost of construction. Thus, the cost of deliveries of 
equipment and one technological booster will be from 400 to 500 
million dollars. 
  But Aleksey Krysanov, department head at the Design Bureau 
for General Machine Building, feels that the profit from these 
deliveries will be small, so that the preservation of jobs at 
production plants will be the most significant attainment. The 
principal income for Russian enterprises, which will probably be 
combined into some consortium, such as the Australians have, 
will come from subsequent sale of Proton boosters for launches 
from the new spaceport. 
  In addition, the Australians propose and even insist on our 
participation in its subsequent operation. And they propose that 
the Russian side become a co-owner of the spaceport, which will 
make it possible to obtain a profit not only from the sale of 
boosters, but also from the results of its commercial use. Our 
contribution to the international consortium will be in the form 
of "know-how." 
  However, the scales of the project and the intensification 
of 
the project during its realization, even without the stiff 
competition in the world commercial launches market, do not make 
it possible to consider the construction of the new privately 
operated spaceport in Papua-New Guinea to be an already 
accomplished fact. It is sufficient to recall the experience of 
such cooperation between Russia and Brazil, where all work 
ceased due to pressure from the American side.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Chernyshov: "Mir + Freedom = Alpha. The </F>
Americans Pay and Profit"] 
  [Text] In the middle of December Russian prime minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and American vice president Albert Gore most 
likely will sign an agreement on the construction of an 
international space station. 
  The two countries for a long time and with great efforts 
went 
as far as they could go to acquire absolute supremacy in the 
manned space sphere. As a result, Russia will not have a new 
gigantic Mir and the United States will not begin construction 
on the Freedom station. But nevertheless an intricate structure 
designated Alpha will appear in orbit. This orbital complex will 
be a "cluster" of several laboratory modules. In addition to 
Russia and the United States, Western Europe, Japan and Canada 
are participating in the project. The cooperating participants 
assume that with minimum financial expenditures -- due to the 
sharing of expenses -- each will have the opportunity to carry 
out research in a unique celestial center outfitted with the 
most modern technology. 
  In the first stage the technique for joint flights is being 
perfected and the capabilities of the vehicles developed for the 
project are being clarified. 
  In the two subsequent stages work will begin on station 
assembly. It will be made up of living and specialized modules, 
solar panels of enormous area and docking units making it 
possible to dock ships of different types (Soyuz, Progress and 
Shuttle) to the orbital scientific research institute. If 
everything goes OK, by the beginning of the coming century the 
international station will constitute a permanently operating 
orbital structure designed for six researchers. The useful 
volume of the living and research compartments is 1200 cubic 
meters and the electric power produced by the sources is 120 kW. 
  At first glance the project is attractive. In the opinion of 
Yuriy Koptev, director of the Russian Space Agency, station 
Alpha is much like a straw which by grasping Russian manned 
cosmonautics will be able to survive. His optimism is 
attributable to the fact that in the first stage the United 
States intends to spend 400 million dollars on the project. A 
large part of this money will go for paying for the services of 
Russia, because this stage involves the intensive use of 
elements of Russian rocket and space technology. 
  To be sure, there also must be an increase in allocations 
"for space" from the Russian federal budget. 
  For the sake of correctness it must be noted at once that 
this project has not only its vigorous proponents, but also not 
less equally opinionated opponents. This applies to virtually 
all the participating countries. 
  Not so long ago the NEW YORK TIMES published interesting 
calculations applying to the American space program. They 
indicate that NASA is still receiving considerable funding from 
the federal budget: over 14 billion dollars annually. Much of 
this sum will go for the construction of an orbital station and 
flights of multiply reusable ships. But these two cost items 
have recently been those most severely cut back. Private space 
business, already today, incidentally, earning good money, has 
moved to the forefront. According to an estimate of the American 
Department of Commerce, five billion dollars of profit were 
earned in this sphere during last year. Most of the income has 
been from communication satellites and space information used in 
environmental research. 
  The largest commercial project is now considered to be the 
Iridium project, carried out by Motorola. Its cost is three 
billion dollars. By the end of the century several tens of 
satellites of this system will provide clients with wireless 
telephonic communication with any point on the planet. NASA is 
not participating in the project, but the Russian enterprise 
Khrunichev is involved, to be sure, with a very modest role. In 
general, however, the very fact of financing of such a 
large-scale scheme completely with private capital, in the 
opinion of analysts, definitely indicates that there have been 
fundamental changes in approaches to space in the United States. 
  In Russia there has been a strong outflow of personnel. The 
branch has aged in a blink: those have remained who have no 
place to go. The production of many components of rocket-space 
equipment without which the implementation of long-term space 
programs is impossible has been put on the shelf. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin visited the Flight Control Center at 
Kaliningrad, near Moscow. He advised a "downsizing." However, 
now at the very top, according to Mr. Koptev, proposals have 
been made which should fundamentally improve the situation in 
the branch. The wage is being increased eightfold in comparison 
with the present-day minimum. Provision also is being made for a 
number of other payments. Alas, even with such a sharp "jump" in 
wages the salary will remain much lower than the earnings not 
only of people from commercial organizations, but even workers 
in many ordinary production fields. But as long as the stage of 
regularization continues, inflation will succeed in reducing 
everything to the former level. 
  In order for Russia to participate in the Alpha project it 
will be necessary to restore connections among tens of 
enterprises not only in Russia, but also in nearby foreign 
countries. That is, return to the same circles from which we 
just emerged. How much will participation in the project cost 
Russia? No one knows the answer. But it is clear that this will 
be hundreds and hundreds of billions of rubles. 
  Western participants see in the project a sort of locomotive 
which will favor further advance in many branches of science and 
technology: medicine, biology, materials science and use of the 
environment. Will Russia be able to use space attainments as 
effectively as our partners? All earlier experience in national 
cosmonautics forces us to doubt this. Just consider space 
environmental science. It earlier remained a "thing unto 
itself." Now environmental surveys, if we speak of the territory 
of Russia, are becoming virtually impossible. 
  Alpha will be put into an orbit with an inclination of 
approximately 52 degrees, traditional for our stations. It is 
advantageous from the energetics point of view, but the northern 
territories will not fall in the station field of view. Earlier 
we settled for this: nevertheless the most populated southern 
part of the USSR was clearly observable. Now from aboard the 
station it will be possible to observe only 7% of the 
territory 
of Russia.

States"; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Academician Roald Sagdeyev scarcely requires 
introductions. For many long years he was the leader of space 
science in the USSR and was at the center of development in our 
country of the most modern types of rocket technologies. Now 
Roald Sagdeyev is an honorary professor in the Physics 
Department of the University of Maryland and is living and 
working in the United States. We asked him to evaluate the 
present-day status of Russian-American space and rocket 
cooperation. 
  Sigov: Over the course of many years the USSR and 
the United States actively cooperated in the cosmonautics field. 
How are these relationships developing now? 
  Sagdeyev: The breakup of the USSR also had a 
negative effect on the development of space science in our 
country. The number of launches has been reduced to one-third 
and there are neither workers or clients for space programs. The 
political stimulus also has fallen away: it is clearly 
unrealistic to participate in a space race with America in order 
to prove the superiority of our social system. 
  Cooperation with the United States is today helping Russia, 
in a time difficult for our country, to maintain its positions 
in the world market in those sectors where for the time being 
they are still strong: in rocket construction and cosmonautics. 
However, mere programs for space cooperation with America will 
not save us. The Americans have cooperated in only a few 
programs, which cannot begin to cover even a small part of the 
capabilities of our space complex. 
  With respect to Russia's use of its commercial potential in 
the space field, the demand for such services in the world 
market is now shrinking. For Russia, even now under the pressure 
of the leading world space powers, quotas have been set which 
simply cannot be changed. Precisely for this reason the contacts 
between NASA and the Russian Space Agency (RSA) and the creation 
of a unique Russian-American space station, which may carry our 
cooperation to new limits, are encouraging. 
  Sigov: Russian opponents of cooperation between 
NASA and the RSA say that we seem to be selling our leading 
space technologies to America for a pittance. Is this actually 
the case? 
  Sagdeyev: To think that America is buying us for a 
pinch of snuff is oversimplified and erroneous. It is impossible 
to give America things free -- that is opposed by the American 
aerospace business, which in the case of Russian dumping loses 
its own orders. It was precisely American companies which were 
successful in setting quotas for Russia in order not to allow 
inexpensive Russian space technologies on the world market. 
  Sigov: It is assumed that under pressure from the 
United States Russia has reexamined or frozen many of its 
projects with other countries. In this sphere to what degree is 
Moscow actually dependent on Washington? 
  Sagdeyev: I feel that there is no political 
pressure by the United States on Russia along these lines. To be 
sure, there is the form of conclusion of exclusive deals between 
companies in the two countries from which Russia, when something 
is disadvantageous to it, has the right to refuse. However, 
there also are extremely advantageous proposals. For example, a 
joint enterprise was recently established with the participation 
of Russian, American and French companies for the development, 
sale and production of a new generation of plasma engines. 
  Such contracts will help Russia to enter the world market 
with the minimum losses to it. But at the same time Russia today 
is simply obligated to cooperate with the United States also in 
another direction -- nonproliferation of rocket technologies, 
especially those which can be used for military purposes. 
Precisely this cooperation also in the last analysis exerted an 
influence on the fate of the Russian-Indian contract for 
cryogenic engines. 
  Sigov: Did not Moscow sell out by breaking the 
extremely advantageous contract with Delhi and how, in general, 
will such Russian behavior be interpreted in other "third world" 
countries desiring to cooperate with Russia? 
  Sagdeyev: With respect to the Indian contract 
there was no simple and unambiguous solution. In Moscow, 
evidently, it was decided that in comparison with the 
"friendship of a friend" (with India), the principles 
(nonproliferation of rocket technologies) were more precious. 
International strategic stability also is preserved due to these 
principles. 
  Unfortunately, the protocol on the nonproliferation of 
rocket 
technologies was signed by the seven leading world powers, but 
Russia was not among its initiators, although we had a moral 
right to this as the homeland of cosmonautics. 
  In the case of the Indian contract I feel that Moscow acted 
correctly, although that type of cryogenic engines which we 
promised India is too exotic for real application in military 
technology. It also is necessary to take into account the fact 
that at the height of the debates on the contract India, with 
the assistance of France, launched its own communication 
satellite, letting it be understood thereby that it had no 
intention to be oriented only on Russia in space cooperation. 
  Looking at this example, the countries of the "third world," 
potential clients of Russia, wishing to receive its rocket 
technologies for use for military purposes, probably have been 
frightened away, which is good. But since in Russia there is 
much which can be proposed for the world market other than 
cryogenic engines, there will be no shortage of customers. For 
example, plans are now being made for a deal between Russia and 
China for the sale of our rocket technologies to them. 
  Sigov: And what other countries are showing an 
interest in Russian rocket technology? 
  Sagdeyev: There is now an oversupply of space 
services on the world market. Russia, the United States and 
France scarcely will allow newcomers from the "third world" to 
enter this market. In addition, as experience shows, these 
countries are striving to acquire specifically military rocket 
technologies (China, Iran, Iraq, and to a lesser degree 
Argentina and Brazil). They all have their national rocket-space 
programs and may potentially be interested in broad-scale 
cooperation with Russia. 
  Sigov: How necessary, in general, are large-scale 
space projects with foreign partners to Russia when the economy 
is in crisis and there is insufficient money even for the most 
insistent needs? 
  Sagdeyev: Today Russia does not have its own 
resources, nor customers abroad, which could "feed" our space 
complex even equal to a third of the former capabilities of the 
USSR. But the creation of a joint orbital station with the 
United States may assist in solving some problems. 
  Sigov: What is the attitude in the United States 
toward space cooperation with Russia? Insofar as I know, many 
American congressmen have an extremely skeptical attitude toward 
it... 
  Sagdeyev: For the time being there is no unanimity 
of opinion with respect to space cooperation with Russia. NASA 
directors feel that cooperation with Moscow is advantageous and 
necessary (although there also is criticism there of such a 
partnership). The White House also is supporting the idea of 
cooperation with Russia in space. At the present time NASA has 
no other recourse than cooperation with Russia. 
  With respect to congress, senators are speaking out who fear 
that cooperation with the Russians will result in a loss of jobs 
and orders for American aerospace complex enterprises. But the 
Americans, I repeat, have no alternative (and they understand 
this): either there will be a station with the Russians or there 
will no station at all. 
  In America there is also the fear that long-term cooperation 
in the space sphere with Russia may become a pawn of political 
instability in our country. But in any case this cooperation is 
not only advantageous to both countries, but also is in the 
interests of world science. 
  Can Russia fully participate in this cooperation with 
America 
when in our country there are many plants on the verge of 
closing, state orders are being lost and functioning of the 
Baykonur cosmodrome is being threatened? I believe that the 
revitalization of our space complex is a matter of honor for 
both the government and each of us individually. Now there is no 
longer need for lofty slogans, but specific actions. 
  Sigov: On what, in our opinion, should the Russian 
leadership be oriented: on commercial gain from the development 
of space and rocket technology or on obtaining political 
dividends in the international arena? 
  Sagdeyev: In my opinion these concepts are 
inseparable. Without effective agreements making it possible to 
exercise control over rocket technologies it is difficult to 
cooperate with the civilized world. But it also is necessary to 
take into account the difficult economic situation in which 
Russia finds itself and therefore where this is possible it also 
necessary to fight for foreign exchange. 
  The strengthening of the positions of Russia in the world 
space market requires close cooperation of all our concerned 
departments -- diplomats, rocket builders, scientists and 
practical workers. Only in such a way will we not only be able 
to maintain already existing positions, but also to reach new 
limits of space partnership with the leading world powers. 
  Postscript. The interview with Academician Roald Sagdeyev 
scarcely is the last word in the discussion of priorities of 
Russian rocket-space diplomacy. In any case the agreements 
signed in the United States on the joint development of the 
orbital station Alpha (successor of the Freedom station, which 
is not to be) give no basis for such an unchallenged evaluation. 
The contribution of Russia to the Alpha project is virtually 
everything which has been developed for the Russian Mir-2 
station and all this work has cost us a sum far greater than the 
400 million dollars allocated by the American side for three 
years. If we ourselves are not going for manned cosmonautics, 
why then should we continue this work no longer for ourselves, 
but for others?

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Cosmonautics in a Beggar's Orbit"; the </F>
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Defense and the Russian Space Agency 
have sent to the government a draft decree of the Council of 
Ministers entitled "Measures for State Support of Russian Space 
Activity and Maintenance of the National Rocket and Space 
Industry." 
  The document is a reaction of the two departments to the 
promise of Viktor Chernomyrdin to provide government support to 
"Russian space," which he made during a visit to the NPO 
Energiya. The draft decree proposes the allocation to the 
Ministry of Defense of 120 billion rubles for settling debts and 
paying for standard deliveries for space hardware, scientific 
research and experimental-design work... 
  It is noteworthy that in the indicated paper provision is 
made for so- called "selective" state support. Seven enterprises 
which are participating directly in the production of Russian 
boosters, the most competitive in the world market, are 
receiving preferential credits. However, observers note that the 
government is considerably watering down the draft decree and it 
is significantly reducing the credits. If this happens, Russian 
cosmonautics will remain in an orbit of a beggarly existence. 
The plan for creating (on the basis of key space enterprises) 
corporations capable of realizing high-technology development 
work in such important branches as electronics, instrument 
making, high-speed railroad transport, aircraft construction, 
etc. is collapsing. The Ministry of Defense cannot update space 
systems for early warning of nuclear attack, satellites for the 
monitoring of the movement of armed forces and space 
communications, which to a high degree have been degraded. 
  Experts feel that this sort of economy (120 billion rubles 
are needed in space; 100 billion were spent on reconstruction of 
the "White House") may finally destroy the space production 
branch.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Pokrovskiy: "What Will It Be Called </F>
Now? Three Continents Are Slated To Meet in Orbit"] 
  [Text] With complicated configuration and a complex fate, 
this international space station has gone through the 
fundamental design studies, but still hasn't gotten a name. 
Either it will be Alpha the first letter of the Greek alphabet 
-- to mark the first step in that direction, or it will be 
Sigma, a symbol of integration, or it will be something else. 
God only knows what will happen and what the name will be. What 
is much more important is that the project opens new prospects 
for the development of a world space program. 
  It was several years ago that Academician Boris Raushenbakh, 
one of the participants in the founding of the our space 
program, observed that the romantic period of its development, 
when every new step in near-Earth space was taken with 
enthusiasm and with not always well-founded hope, has ended. The 
time has come when any and all of the multitude of space 
projects are assessed soberly and in a businesslike manner. 
  And recently, the current director of the Russian Space 
Agency, Yuriy Koptev, sighed heavily about that same period of 
"romantic dreams": 
  "Do you know the most horrible sin that a space firm could 
have committed back then? To not use up by the end of the year 
all the monies allocated to it." 
  Koptev's sighs are understandable to any Russian. What is 
more surprising is that sighs no less heavy are emanating from 
across the ocean. America's NASA, after calculating the 
prospects of the operation of long-duration orbital stations -- 
and that includes on the basis of our Mir -- clearly couldn't 
manage the development of its own Freedom station within the 
time and monetary constraints set by Congress. 
  Then the Alpha project appeared. 
  What does it consist of? Briefly put, in the conditions that 
exist today, it is best to design and build a permanently 
inhabited international space station with an inclination of 
51.6, i.e., with the same inclination at which Mir is now 
flying. The same stock of completed research gathered in our 
country for the Mir-2 will be used for the station, as well as 
the American, European, and Japanese modules. 
  The first stage of this grandiose program calls for the 
joint 
work of crews from Russia and the United States on the Mir 
station and the Space Shuttle. Missions of the American shuttles 
to the Russian station will begin in 1995 and will be used for 
outfitting Mir with equipment that will include solar arrays 
that are more productive. The Russian party will supplement the 
station with the Spektr and Priroda modules, which will house, 
in addition to our equipment, two and a half tons of American 
instruments. 
  Some $370 million have already been allocated for that, and 
the financing will begin this coming year. Thus, in addition to 
expanding the research possibilities of the station, valuable 
experience will be garnered for creating and using the new 
international space facility. 
  The second stage, which begins in mid-1997, will involve the 
startup of the assembly of the station out of individual units, 
including the American living module and our towcraft, which 
will be put into orbit by the Shuttles and the Protons. And 
finally, in 1998, the complex will grow with a European and a 
Japanese module and three more Russian modules. The station will 
function for 10-15 years. 
  "And what will the average taxpayer get out of all that?" 
our 
journalists love to ask, following the Western example. Let's 
discuss it the way they do in the West. For a start, our space 
firms, which have absorbed the intellectual and technical 
flowering of Russia, will get guaranteed contracts, and that 
means that jobs and "brains" will be kept. Just what the 
intellectual wealth is, is indicated directly by the example of 
the birth of the international space station project. The 
Russian experience in the operation of long-duration orbital 
facilities in this case have made it possible, in the estimates 
of specialists, to shorten building the station by three to 
three and a half years and cut expenses considerably. 
Consequently, even if they wanted to (and that desire exists 
among some of our rivals), they couldn't get along without 
Russia on the world space market. 
  Generally, we need to give proper due, it seems to me, to 
the 
skillful commercial policy of the Russian Space Agency. Step by 
step, systematically, it is getting around the obstacles that 
--both officially by the COCOM ban and, so to speak, quietly -- 
are being placed in the path of getting our hardware to the 
market. One after another, individual agreements are being 
arranged for the use of the Protons to launch a number of 
satellites and for the creation in Papua New Guinea of a launch 
facility for commercial launches. And now the project for the 
international space station, more than anything else, is 
providing for the conclusion of such a political agreement with 
Russia (most likely during the forthcoming visit of U.S. Vice 
President Gore), which will open the road to Russia to a 
full-fledged partnership. 
  That is especially needed now, when the space program is, 
more and more, turning to us not its "celestial" [illegible], 
but its "early" [illegible]. It's no secret to anyone that the 
Earth is ill. It's ill with civilization, as a child is with 
chickenpox. The abscesses of the industrial megalopolises are 
spread across the body of the planet, poisoning it with 
industrial waste, polluting its water and air, reducing its 
forests and making its soil barren, thinning the ozone layer, 
and changing the gene pool. All those attacks can be seen best 
from space. And in space, the antidotes to them can be made. 
Already planned is the production there of biomedical 
preparations, the growth of especially pure semiconductors, and 
the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy. Much can 
be found there by the researchers from the various countries 
gathering in orbit in the name of our common cradle.

"Extending One's Hand From the Mir to Mars; The Next Space 
Expedition Leaves in January. It Includes a Physician Who Will 
Spend a Record Time in the Station: 427 Days"] 
  [Text] The principal hero of the experiment is 
cosmonaut-researcher Valeriy Polyakov, deputy director of the 
Biomedical Problems Institute, candidate of medical sciences. He 
already has been in the orbital station. He worked there for 241 
days with Aleksandr Volkov and Sergey Krikalev. 
  "Yes, we need this flight primarily as a record," states 
Polyakov. "It is impossible for us to let go of our first-place 
standings with ease. In addition, it will afford us the 
opportunity for the first time to rehearse the medical support 
for what in essence is an expedition to Mars." 
  "But a record time is not an objective in itself. The flight 
will be saturated to the limit with an interesting scientific 
program. It will enable us to rise to a new level in 
understanding all that which transpires in the human body in 
space. The project has been supported by all those countries of 
Western Europe whose astronauts have flown in the Mir and which 
are actively participating in realization of the new flight." 
  "Valeriy and I will set to work," says Colonel Viktor 
Afanasyev, the crew commander, joining into the conversation. We 
calculated: the crew literally each day will participate in 
medical research. The active work of a physician will determine 
the character not only of our expedition, but two others as well 
which it will meet and live with in orbit. But we also have 
planned other experiments: in the fields of material science, 
bioengineering and astronomy. 
  Viktor Afanasyev also is no novice in space. When he went 
before the interdepartmental state commission for admission to 
special training he was scheduled for flight under the Buran 
program. Then he was transferred to the group of pilots for 
spaceships of the Soyuz-TM series. He made his first flight in 
the Mir station together with Musa Manarov in 1990-1991. 
  The ship's engineer, Yuriy Usachev, is the youngest in the 
crew and perhaps the youngest among those who are today 
preparing for flights under different programs. To my question 
as to how he feels psychologically prior to the launch, whether 
he is ready, he became thoughtful: 
  "I do not know what to say. It is probably necessary to sit 
first in the ship, enter orbit and work for at least a half-year 
in the station, and so it is possible to philosophize for a long 
time. I will go with quite experienced cosmonauts and I would 
not want to feel myself such a schoolboy. During the time of the 
expedition I will strive to `get educated,' to better study all 
the systems and equipment on the station. It is necessary to fly 
more than once." 
  At any rate, we wish good success to the cosmonauts.

  [Abstract] Most satellite IR radiometers used for remote 
sensing of the atmosphere and the underlying layer have systems 
of onboard absolute calibration of measurements of outgoing 
radiation. For various reasons, however, the instruments must be 
calibrated independently for the different periods of their 
operation. As a rule, such calibration consists of calculations 
of the absolute values of the intensity of outgoing radiation on 
the basis of the use of modern radiation models of the 
atmosphere, information on the physical and optical state of the 
atmosphere and the underlying layer in the areas of calibration, 
and the spectral characteristics of the radiometers. There are 
inherent difficulties in objectively assessing the accuracy of 
such calibration and in factoring various kinds of information 
into the calibration algorithms. The researchers here use the 
statistical regression method in the calibration, guaranteeing 
the smallest rms error of prediction and making it easy to 
consider arbitrary sets of controlled variables and arbitrary 
measurement modes. An adequate radiation model for statistical 
modeling of emission variations is used for given variations of 
parameters of an optical-meteorological model of the atmosphere. 
The radiation model (an integral equation of thermal emission 
transfer) is linearized in the vicinity of some standard 
atmospheric state satisfying the average climatic or seasonal 
conditions for a given region. References 7: 3 Russian, 4

"Astronomy": "The Ultraviolet Universe: Space Telescope Studies 
New Stars"] 
  [Text] A new space-based ultraviolet telescope designed and 
built in Israel will make it possible to penetrate the mysteries 
of the universe. That telescope -- the result of the joint 
efforts of Tel-Aviv University, the Israeli Space Agency, and 
the firm ELOP -- will be the "all-seeing eye" of a spacecraft 
that will be launched in 1995. Israel has received permission to 
participate in an international project involving the first 
science mission for the study of celestial objects in the 
ultraviolet range of the spectrum. 
  "We have all the necessary basic infrastructure for space 
technologies," said Ethan Reys (Eytan Reys), the head of the 
space developments division of the firm ELOP. 
  The TAUVEX telescope (TAUVEX stands for Tel-Aviv University 
UV Explorer) was developed to fill the considerable gap in our 
knowledge of the universe. Astronomers have successfully 
observed stars in a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
to include the visible, radio, x-ray, and infrared ranges of the 
spectrum. The ultraviolet range, however, remains accessible in 
only individual fragments. 
  "It is impossible to perform sufficiently precise 
observations in the UV spectrum from the ground, because of the 
severe scattering of UV radiation in the atmosphere," said Reys. 
"The only way to get images of distant or weak stars is to take 
the science instrumentation into space." 
  TAUVEX will be pointed at "white dwarfs" (new stars that 
emit 
high-energy UV radiation), binaries (binary stars), galaxies, 
and quasars (extremely bright objects at the edge of the 
universe). "We expect the search for quasars to be more 
productive than any other search every undertaken," said Dr. N. 
Brosh, an astronomer at the Weiss [Vays] Observatory of Tel-Aviv 
University. That observatory is the most active observatory in 
the Eastern Mediterranean. "We expect to catalog more than 
10,000 new quasars, which will be identified from their UV 
spectra. At present, only about 4,000 quasars are known from 
ground-based observations." 
  The information that will be obtained in the course of the 
mission will help scientists to have a better understanding of 
the physical nature of high-energy sources such as neutron stars 
and black holes. Using the broad-range UV telescope, scientists 
will have a unique opportunity to get to the heart of the 
process associated with the formation of stars and to ascertain 
their makeup, velocity, size, age, emittance, and position. All 
that information not only expands our knowledge of the current 
state of stars, their origin, and history, but will also help to 
predict their future. 
  The images will be obtained with three telescopes: two of 
them designed for scientific research, and the third serving as 
a position and velocity sensor for the spacecraft itself. Those 
data are very important in that producing images requires 
lengthy exposures. "The data of the third telescope will make it 
possible to reconstruct images that are blurry because of the 
long exposure while the spacecraft is moving. The information on 
direction and velocity makes it possible to produce images as if 
from an immobile platform," said Reys. 
  The spacecraft will be launched into an elliptical orbit 
with 
a maximum distance from Earth of 200,000 km and a revolution 
period of three days. Low-orbit satellites usually complete a 
revolution in an hour and a half. The satellite will function in 
orbit for three years. 
  One other unique feature of the TAUVEX system is that it 
provides a field of view that is 500 times greater than the 
field of view of the wide-angle camera of the Hubble Space 
Telescope. 
  The satellite is to be launched from the CIS. The data will 
be received at sites in Russia, but will be made accessible to 
all scientists participating in the project.

  [Abstract] In work reported earlier (Smirnov et al., 
"Geocentric Boost Trajectory for Spacecraft With Solar Sail," 
KOSMICH. ISSLED., 1993, Vol 31, No 3, pp 74-90), the researchers 
here studied boost trajectories that took spacecraft from low 
geocentric orbit to outside the Earth's sphere of influence. 
Trajectories with the fastest boost included a perturbation 
maneuver near the Moon and consisted of three legs, the first 
and the third using a locally optimal principle for controlling 
the sail, and the second being a passive leg. The times for the 
beginning and end of the passive leg are chosen such that they 
ensure swingby of the Moon and optimize the perturbation 
maneuver. The modulus for the geocentric velocity of the 
spacecraft after swingby must be maximized. During the swingby, 
if the angle between the planes of orbit of the spacecraft and 
the Moon is large, then the spacecraft can be sent to any point 
of the rather small environs of the Moon on the picture plane 
via selection of the beginning and ending times of the passive 
leg. If the angle is 2-20, however, the small environs of 
the Moon in the picture plane may be unreachable, which limits 
the possibilities of a perturbation maneuver. In the earlier 
work, to expand the perturbation maneuver possibilities, the 
researchers suggested reducing the angle to less than 1 by 
making a minor correction in the locally optimal principle of 
control in the first and third boost legs. Here, they suggest a 
different method for optimizing the perturbation maneuver, i.e., 
inserting an additional leg just before swingby. In the new leg, 
the locally optimal control is replaced by optimal control that 
maximizes the geocentric boost of the spacecraft after swingby. 
The length of the new leg is the problem parameter. If the 
length is large, the efficiency of the maneuver is increased 
considerably and total boost time is reduced somewhat. Figures 
1, references 9 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The high-energy charged-particle fluxes that 
accompany solar flares are a focus of study because of their 
effect on biological objects and hardware during spaceflight. 
The danger associated with such events depends on the frequency 
of the events, the magnitude of the flux, and particle energy 
spectrum. Based on acquired experimental data, solar cosmic ray 
events are classified here by magnitude of total proton fluence. 
At proton energies of more than 30 MeV, power-law functions of 
particle rigidity serve well to describe the averaged energy 
spectra of peak proton fluxes and proton fluences that 
characterize solar cosmic ray events of varying magnitude. 
Average energy events become steadily more rigid as event 
fluence magnitude grows, and average magnitudes of peak flux 
remain proportional to fluence across the entire range of 
fluence variation. The averaged energy spectra of anomalously 
large and very large events do not contain anomalies in terms of 
probability of occurrence or type of energy spectrum. The 
average energy spectra of solar cosmic ray events differ from 
those of CREME in that they establish the presence of rather 
large, high-energy particle fluxes in the solar cosmic events. 
Such particle penetrate spacecraft shields, or, after passing 
through the Earth's magnetic field, they penetrate to lower 
geomagnetic latitudes in the Earth's atmosphere and to the 
near-Earth orbits of satellites with small inclinations. Figures 
7, references 15: 3 Russian, 12 Western.

Shestopalov; UDC 581.521] 
  [Abstract] Sources of radiation in interplanetary space are 
essentially three: galactic cosmic rays, solar-flare cosmic 
rays, and recurrent fluxes of low-energy particles from the Sun. 
The most dangerous of the three are solar-flare cosmic rays, on 
which there exists the smallest volume of data. Forecast methods 
associated with a search for flare precursors in the optical, 
radio, and x-ray ranges are unreliable in predicting solar 
proton events. The work reported here is a continuation of 
earlier work by Shestopalov et al. in which the researchers 
demonstrated that proton flares arise in the course of processes 
that encompass not only various layers of the solar surface, but 
also interplanetary space. Moving a step farther, the 
researchers here show that the preflare period involves not only 
changes on the Sun and in interplanetary space, but also a 
disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere and magnetic field and 
a generation of particles in near-Earth space. Active regions 
are observed on the Sun during the period, as are coronal 
formations and their ejection into interplanetary space. Large 
proton- and electron-filled ordered magnetic structures appear 
in interplanetary space, and the flux of galactic cosmic rays 
diminishes. On Earth, magnetic activity increases, causing in 
turn an increase in the amplitudes of magnetic storms in those 
areas. In addition, magnetospheric protons with energies of 40 
MeV or greater are recorded in interplanetary space. Figures 5,

  [Abstract] One of the principal objectives associated with 
the study of the Martial surface in the Mars-94 mission will 
involve study of the cryolithosphere of the planet and its depth 
structure. An orbiting vehicle will probe the surface with radar 
in the frequency range of 0.5-5 MHz with the emission of pulsed 
radio signals and measurement of the strength of the signals 
reflected off the nightside surface. Interpretation of the 
signals will be unusual in that the cryolithosphere is a 
multicomponent medium with a nonuniform structure that results 
from, among other things, considerable depth variation in ice 
content and the possible presence of saline ice and briny 
solutions. In light of that, the work reported here involves a 
technique for calculating the depth profiles of the dielectric 
permeability of the mixtures of the various materials in the 
cryolithosphere based on the temperature and frequency 
relationships of the dielectric permeability of ice. The 
technique assumes that the frozen ground can contain either 
freshwater ice or saline ice, and it enables calculation of the 
dielectric permeability of two- and three-phase 
ellipsoidal-particles mixtures, depending on the volumetric 
content of the soil components and their dielectric 
permeability. The dielectric permeability of ice is calculated 
in the context of the theory of orientation polarization of 
dielectrics with typical relaxation times. The researchers 
concluded that the skin layer may be hundreds or thousands of 
meters thick, depending on the soil composition. Figures 4,

  [Abstract] The probability of a collision between the Earth 
and an asteroid such as Amor, Apollo, or Aton is not at all 
small. The work reported here consists of the results of a 
preliminary analysis of the use of various methods for 
preventing such a collision, all of which involve changing the 
asteroid's orbit: space vehicle impact; delivery and attachment 
of a large-thrust engine to the asteroid; attachment of 
low-thrust electroreactive engines; attachment of a solar sail; 
and changing the color (thus, the reflective properties) of the 
asteroid's surface. Prevention of the collision is considered to 
be guaranteed if the flyby distance is at least 1 million 
kilometers. The asteroid, in the calculations, is taken to be a 
sphere with a density of 3 g/cm[.sup]3[/]. Estimates are made 
for asteroids with radii of 5 m, 50 m, and 500 m and masses of 
1.57 x 10[.sup]6[/] tons and 1.57 x 10[.sup]9[/] tons. 
After a comparative analysis of the methods, the researchers 
chose the impact method as the most effective method and a 
method that could be performed with existing technology. 
Numerical estimates are given for the asteroid Toutatis, which 
flew by Earth in December 1992. The work was performed in the 
context of an agreement with the International Institute of 
Problems of Asteroid Hazards under the Toutatis-B2 grant.

  [Abstract] In a survey of the history and background of 
"asteroid hazard," the researchers here define such danger as 
the threat of collision with Drobyshevskiy cometoids or 
comet-shower comets from Oort's Cloud, asteroids near the Earth 
(primarily of cometary origin), asteroids with chaotic orbits, 
and short-period comets. We are, they conclude, in a period of 
minimal cometary activity and asteroid hazard because the last 
cometary shower caused by disturbance of the cometary cloud 
ended long ago, and the next such event will not occur for at 
least 10 million years. Nor are there at present any objects 
near the Sun that could cause such a shower. Finally, the 
unexpected and unpredictable cometoid activity described by 
Drobyshevskiy and resulting from an explosion of the Jovian moon 
Callisto is virtually impossible. At the same time, the 
statistically unpredictable fluctuation in asteroid hazard 
dictate that we refine our theoretical research of the problem 
and set up observation programs. The objective of the first 
stage of such research would be to move asteroid collisions from 
the ranks of random, unpredictable phenomena to the ranks of 
predictable, calculable events. References 17: 13 Russian, 4

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Yemelyanov: "This Yar Wasn't So Easy to </F>
Come By: Our First Space Launch Facility Hears the Roar of 
Rockets Less and Less Often"] 
  [Text] When the United States got its hands on the German 
V-2s in '45, it was soaring high in the sky. The USSR managed to 
get only the crumbs from the German rocket pie, but we had S. 
Korolev and V. Glushko and the pride of the victors. 
  On October 18 of '47, the first Soviet rocket, the R-1, flew 
its first 207 km. It launched from the top-secret testing 
grounds of Kapustin Yar. Out of 10 proposed sites strewn across 
the Union, a piece of the Volga steppe the size of a small 
European state was chosen. They say that Lawrence Berry 
[Lavrentiy Beriya] himself kept tabs on the project. 
  They didn't allot much time to hammer out the country's 
missile shield, throwing three engineering-construction brigades 
from the front to Kapustin Yar. V. Voznyuk, the katyusha 
specialist who had rocketed from major to general in one year of 
the war, created a super testing ground on the barren spot at 
Stalin's command. The railroad to it from Stalingrad didn't go 
through a single population center. 
  The military watch began with the R-2, the absolute favorite 
of the testers for the 6 tons of alcohol that went in to make up 
the fuel. The R-5 was the first missile with a nuclear warhead 
to rush to the east. They say there that, to this day, no one 
knows whether it exploded or not, or where it could have 
happened. The famous R-12s, which were hauled to Cuba in order 
to settle the Caribbean crisis, stood "cocked" for a full 30 
years and were regarded as the strongest of the fingers of our 
nuclear fist. True, the alcohol in them was long gone, but the 
parity with the Yankees wasn't shaken. The RSD-10 (SS-20), which 
was born in '73 and shocked all our enemies, had no match for 
many years. When the United States got wind of them, it decided 
right then and there to make peace with the "evil empire." 
  The road was carved out for Gagarin by 48 dogs launched from 
Kapustin Yar. The first to go aloft, in the summer of '51, were 
not Belka and Strelka, who were also prepared here, but Dozik 
and Tsygan. Later one pioneer died, and a second lived with S. 
Korolev's family. A dog by the name of Otvazhnaya [Brave] went 
up four times. But not all of them were drawn to the stars -- 
one animal decided to run away just before the launch, right 
from the launch pad, and they had to send the nearest mongrel up 
into space in its place. But it didn't matter, they got the job 
done for the party and the government. 
  At Kapustin Yar, they built the first artificial Earth 
satellite, which was put into orbit from Baykonur. At Kapustin 
Yar, they worked the bugs out of the space television, radio, 
and telephone communications. 
  The heaviest fog of secrecy had barely lifted in '73, when 
we 
helped the Poles lift their first, the Copernicus-500, to the 
proper altitude. We launched the friendly Indian Ariabata series 
in '75, and after that, even the French were allowed to go to 
orbit from there. 
  Buran, which engendered a flurry of enthusiasm when it took 
off and landed in Kazakhstan, was painstakingly built in the 
Volga region under the supervision of German Titov. 
  But in the '80s, we got "caught up," as it were, in big 
space. The USSR had another space jacket -- Baykonur 
  Hit over the Urals on the first of May in '60, the American 
pilot Powers had been quite [illegible] as he bailed out of the 
cozy U-2. His superiors had not warned him that the Russians had 
the Volkhov S-75 antiaircraft missile complex, which laughed at 
the high-altitude jet capabilities of the reconnaissance plane 
from the States. They didn't warn him because they didn't know 
the Russian had it. 
  The antiaircraft testing grounds had broken away from its 
strategic missile brother in '51, and within less than two 
months, it roared with the first vertical-launch surface-to-air 
missile. The multichannel creation was outfitted to protect the 
motherland's capital. Within three years, the surface-to-air 
missile complex was firing at 20 targets at once. In May of '55, 
first Moscow, and then other important centers and borders were 
bristling with the arrows of SAMs. 
  The first mobile SAM unit, the Dvina, was combat ready in 
late '57, near Brest. A version of it, the Volkhov, not only 
interrupted the spy flight over the center of the Soviet 
military-industrial complex, but also let the United States know 
that the USSR was ahead of everyone else on the planet in air 
defense, which meant that it was hazardous to flit about 
perniciously over one-sixth of the land surface. 
  The Volkhov, and later the Pechora, made their way to 40 
countries and didn't do badly in the confrontation with Phantoms 
in Viet Nam and Mirages in the Near East. 
  In just two years at Kapustin Yar, they "rolled out" the 
first automatic system for controlling SAMs. The mid-60s saw the 
appearance of radar systems for detecting enemy aircraft. 
Finally, unique simulator systems were created in the '70s. That 
is, by turning on a computer, but without launching aircraft or 
rockets, they were able to work out the bugs there in combat 
with any air attack that might happen. The Americans were 
gnashing their teeth with envy. And in February of '93, all they 
could do was hold on to a pillar in Abu Dabi: in the Arabian 
sky, Russian-made S-300s on the fly knocked out two cruise 
missiles. The sheiks gave a standing ovation. 
  Do you remember the story about the "submarine in the 
Ukrainian steppes?" It's not altogether a myth. In Kapustin Yar, 
in an immense basin, is a sub in which they used to test 
sea-launched missiles. Generally speaking, Kapustin Yar is 
replete with legends. The burst of myth-making began between '88 
and '91, when 654 intermediate-range SS-20 missiles were being 
destroyed here. 
  Legend No. 1: nuclear explosions occur in the Volga steppes. 
In fact, the warheads have been removed in other places, and 
here they've only exploded batches of airframes. 
  Legend No. 2: as a result of the explosions in Kapustin Yar, 
windows have shattered, walls have cracked, and, in Volgograd, 
homes have been demolished. On August 30 of '90, Academician Ye. 
Velikhov reported in an analysis that the seismic vibrations 5 
kilometers from the explosion site do not exceed 3 on the scale. 
It's 28 kilometers to Kapustin Yar, the windows in the local 
department store shattered only once, when a fighter plane broke 
the sound barrier over the city. 
  Legend No. 3: a massive die-off of sheep was associated with 
the missiles. A commission of the main directorate, 
veterinarians, and a scientific research institute found sulfur 
and arsenic in the wool and livers of the sheep that died. The 
lab head from the All-Union Scientific Research Institute, G. 
Kashfutdinov, suggested that "the main reason for the deaths 
was, apparently, the rocket-fuel combustion products of unknown 
composition." We could brand the fleecing missile-people, but 
the "rocket fuel products" of the SS-20 contain neither sulfur, 
nor arsenic; the emissions of the Astrakhan Gas-Condensate 
Combine, however, does contain those products. 
  The keys to the Kapustin Yar, a city of 32,000 closed off by 
three checkpoints, are held in two hands -- that of the garrison 
leadership and that of the city government. And although the 
small Astrakhan Oblast Council pointed out on May 17 of this 
year that, according to current law, the civilian executive body 
is supposed to reign in Kapustin Yar, the real boss of that 
settlement is Gen. V. Tonkikh. 
  But that doesn't mean that the missile arm of authority and 
the civilian arm of authority are locked in battle under the 
carpet. Last April, the local police, together with the 
military, averted a massive action of youth that was meant to 
"run out of town" Kavkaz people who had been attracted to 
Kapustin Yar to revive trade. It was averted without any 
injuries. Over all of '93, there was only one murder. 
  The initial impression that it's mainly sports figures and 
top models who live there was confirmed in a visit I made to the 
sports complex, which has a pool, a shooting range, and a 
stadium. 
  Today, the leasing of launch pads in Kazakhstan, which may 
be 
seeing their last winter, costs billions, and their equipment 
and people can and should be transferred to a re-outfitted 
Kapustin Yar, where products and fuel don't have to be brought 
in by plane. 
  And if Plesetsk, planted in the northern bogs, can be 
regarded as the Russian equivalent to the Kapustin Yar missile 
testing grounds, then the air-defense testing grounds in 
Zavolzhye is the only one in Russia. We no other sites where we 
can do a professional job of testing antiaircraft systems that 
tomorrow would protect both the country and its interests in 
local conflicts. Where else is it possible to be demonstrating 
to hard-currency buyers, on a permanent basis, new SAM complexes 
in all their glory (China has already bought a batch of S-300s, 
Kuwait is thing about it, although what's there to think about 
-- the Patriots are more expensive and not as good)? In the 
opinion of V. Korolev, the deputy chief for science of the 
air-defense testing grounds, any and all kinds of weapons from 
any of the combat arms could be tested in Kapustin Yar. 
  Whatever the military doctrine, it would be stupid to not 
preserve the Kapustin Yar testing grounds after having made them 
into a base for the country's armed forces and having abandoned 
expensive foreign launch pads.

  [Abstract] In studying the danger of asteroid collisions 
with Earth, one must identify the objects whose orbits will 
intersect with that of Earth. At present, those objects comprise 
asteroids of the Apollo, Amor, and Aten groups; asteroids of the 
X group; short-period comets; and large fragments of meteor 
trails. This paper examines only asteroids of the Apollo, Amor, 
and Aten groups, primarily because we have precise data 
describing their orbits. It focuses on 114 asteroids. The 
researchers perform numerical integration of the equations of 
motion of those objects via a method advanced by Everhart. 
Orbital elements were calculated, as were minimum distances 
under 0.05 au between the asteroids and Earth. A total of 89 of 
the asteroids were found to be candidates for a collision. The 
line of apsides of the asteroids has a rotational-translational 
motion, completing a full revolution over a period of tens of 
thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Over a period of a 
full revolution, the asteroid orbit can intersect with that of 
Earth at four points. The researchers computed the mathematical 
probability _t_ of such an event as a function of asteroid 
velocity and orbital inclination and then calculated the time 
period in which the asteroid could collide with Earth. Although 
it could take 6-10 million years before an asteroid could 
collide, the overall danger of collision is considerably greater 
than is the danger associated with one asteroid, mainly because 
there may be many asteroid still undiscovered. References 8: 6

  [Abstract] Trajectory designs have traditionally involved a 
single-stage, one-impulse flight to halo orbit near libration 
points L[.sup]1[/] and L[.sub]2[/] of the Sun-Earth 
system. Launch parameters were chosen so that after boost near 
Earth, the spacecraft would enter a trajectory passing rather 
close to the libration points, with halo orbit C = 0. Other 
researchers have proposed designs that reduce the orbit-size 
parameters, with a rendezvous with the Moon not immediately 
after launch, but after a given number of revolutions in a 
highly elliptical orbit whose perigee is near the Earth and 
whose apogee distance is greater than the radius of the lunar 
orbit. The researchers here study the possible use of such a 
trajectory to perform the Relict-2 mission in the context of the 
constraints on the control system that is to be used in the 
mission. Analysis shows that a design with two revolutions in 
intermediate orbit is best for trajectories involving a lunar 
swing-by. The maximum size of the halo orbit for an October 
launch would be 250,000-310,000 km; for a November launch, 
180,000-220,000 km. Height of perigee for the first launch date 
would be less than 320 km; for the November launch, lower than 
300 km. The spacecraft would probably not be in the Earth's 
shadow for the first year. Figures 2, references 5: 3 Russian, 2

<F P=106> [Report by TRUD correspondent Nikolay Kishkin: "The First </F>
Test of Strength"] 
  [Text] Over the past week the State Duma has generally 
completed its internal self-organizing. Eight factions and one 
deputy group, made up of slightly more than 400 deputies, have 
been formed. Some remained "on the loose"--those who could not 
form their own groups because of the high "threshold" 
requirement but did not want to join the existing ones. Russia's 
Choice became the largest faction, with 76 deputies; 
interestingly, Zhirinovskiy's faction was pushed back to third 
place by the New Regional Policy group of 65 deputies elected 
from one-seat districts. The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia] was two deputies behind in numbers. Now the faction and 
group leaders together with the speaker form the Duma Council. 
  The setting up of parliamentary committees also proceeded 
without particular cataclysms. Actually, all the struggles took 
place behind the scenes: Even before the session the factions 
divided the portfolios by striking deals as to who would get 
which committee, and then took to the plenary session a 
coordinated draft distribution of responsibilities to be adopted 
as a package. Which it was. Zhirinovskiy's dream of becoming 
chairman of the International Affairs Committee did not 
materialize--the chairmanship went to V. Lukin. Two 
committees--defense and national security--attracted special 
attention. S. Yushenkov (Russia's Choice) and V. Ilyukhin 
(Communist Party of Russia), respectively, were elected 
chairmen. M. Zadornov (Yavlinskiy's bloc) took charge of the 
Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance Committee. V. Isakov, a 
former Supreme Soviet deputy and one of the leaders of the 
irreconcilable opposition, on the other hand, essentially kept 
his old job as chairman of one of the key committees--on 
legislation and judicial and legal reform. 
  So what is the current disposition of forces? There will be 
a 
total of 23 committees in the Duma. Five of them are headed by 
LDPR representatives; four by Russia's Choice; three each by 
representatives of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] 
and New Regional Policy; two each went to the APR [Agrarian 
Party of Russia], KPR [Communist Party of Russia], and YaBL 
[Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]; and one each to Women of 
Russia and the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]. This 
distribution more or less corresponds to the proportional weight 
of Duma factions, which did not keep one group of deputies, 
among whom the best known was S. Baburin, from lodging a 
protest. They did not like the fact that nine committees went to 
representatives of reformist blocs. Overall there is a 
perceptible desire on the part of a certain group of deputies 
who brought to the Duma their old confrontational attitudes to 
push these blocs aside. Although it is quite obvious that with 
the current disposition of forces only an effort to work 
together and take into consideration the opinion of others will 
enable the Duma to function normally. 
  At the same time the first votes showed that three 
factions--APR, KPR, and LDPR (165 votes)--clearly form a bloc, 
at least when it comes to personnel appointments. It is hard at 
this point to judge the leanings of the New Regional Policy 
group--they will become clear only when political and economic 
problems come up for substantive discussion. In any case, the 
reformist blocs (which are not all that united among 
themselves), which account for only 133 votes, should be 
interested in cooperation with these factions, as well as with 
Women of Russia faction.

<F P=106> [Report by TRUD correspondent Nikolay Dorofeyev: "Deputy </F>
Baburin's Car to the Entrance!"] 
  [Text] While members of the Federation Council took a short 
recess from their activities, State Duma deputies continued to 
work. There probably would be no reason to delve into the 
subject of the Duma today had it not been for one somewhat 
alarming aspect of its activities. 
  Among other documents presented for the consideration of 
Duma 
members was the Statute on Material Support of the Activities of 
the Deputies to the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly. The deputies came up with a lot of comments and 
amendments. What is it that the parliament members are not happy 
about? The list of amendments indicates that it is mostly the 
level of their own material support. It came out, for instance, 
that Duma members are not happy with a salary that amounts to 90 
percent of a federal minister's salary plus bonuses for the 
special nature and intensity of the job, as well as for length 
of service. It does not look much compared to commercial 
structures, and, judging by all signs, they feel insulted at 
being equated to ministers. 
  There was a multitude of proposals, including this: to set a 
Duma member's salary at $3,000 paid in ruble equivalent... In 
the end they finally agreed on the following: to set a Duma 
member's salary as equal to that of a federal minister plus 
bonuses... Somewhere on the plus side of half a million. And 40 
days vacation. 
  A lengthy discussion ensued on the topic of the size of 
reimbursement for various expenses such as telephone calls and 
other unforeseen deputy expenses. The discussion reached its 
peak when the matter of providing Duma members with 
transportation came up. Parliament members were not about to 
accept a motor pool service on request. Some insisted on having 
a phone in the car. The majority, however, were most pleased 
with the proposal of S. Baburin, veteran of Russian 
parliamentary life, to assign an official car to each deputy. 
  It is easy to visualize: 450 cars (one for each member of 
the 
State Duma) idle the entire workday around the parliament's 
perimeter waiting for a call like this: "Deputy Baburin's 
car--to the entrance!" 
  It is, of course, both convenient and prestigious. I think, 
however, that Deputy N. Travkin was right in trying to explain 
to his colleagues what kind of blow to their reputation such 
decisions produce. They did not listen to him, however. 
  In short, the entire course of the discussion on the matter 
of deputies' material support graphically demonstrated how 
strong among us is the conviction that it is so much better to 
champion people's interests on a salary no lower than that of a 
minister and to look at the outside world from the window of a 
personal chauffeured car...

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Sargin under the rubric "Scandal": "A </F>
Soft Landing to You, Mr. President!"] 
  [Text] It is interesting whether the president of 
Russia will be able to endure aerobatic maneuvers, such as 
"loops" or "rolls," and still retain his ability to work. It 
appears that we will not have to wait long for the outcome of a 
bold experiment. However, let us have everything in proper 
order. 
  Few people know that the plane carrying B.N. Yeltsin has 
already repeatedly been on the brink of crashing, and that this 
has not been arranged for him by his foreign partners but rather 
by his own pilots. 
  The first case. Returning from Yakutsk on 18 June 
1993, chief pilot A. Larin, the commander of a separate aviation 
detachment of civil aviation of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Transportation, landed the plane in Vnukovo flying 1,350 
meters further than prescribed. B. Yeltsin was on board the 
plane at the time. The second case. Without 
restricting himself to what had already been achieved, A. Larin 
flew an excessive 1,400 meters at the already mentioned Vnukovo 
when returning from Warsaw on 24 August 1993 (the president was 
on board the plane on this occasion, too). Incidentally, if 
excess flight by an Il-62 comes to no more than 800 meters, the 
pilot receives a grade of "three" for such a blunder in the 
flight critique. There is no need to say what the aforementioned 
numbers "merit." The length of the runway at Vnukovo is 3,050 
meters; the flight operations manual for the Il-62 says that the 
runway for its landing should be no shorter than 2,700 meters. 
Therefore, had it not been for good meteorological conditions, 
the presidential liner would have plowed into the fields of 
Vnukovo. To be sure, B. Yeltsin is already accustomed to this; 
he experienced hard landings as early as 1990, and in Spain, 
when he was "disgraced." Apparently this is what the culprits in 
these emergencies counted on, as they concealed the emergencies 
from the leadership of the country. Prior to these cases there 
had been no flight accidents in "detachment No. 1." 
  The crews of the Separate Aviation Detachment of Civil 
Aviation of the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation 
have carried everyone on their liners! After all, this 
enterprise, known as detachment No. 235, is intended to carry 
specifically "the powers that be." Naturally, the professional 
standard of the flight personnel in the detachment is 
exceptionally high. Pilots are prepared to fly to any point in 
the world with the highest degree of flight safety. Cadres for 
the "Tsar's stable" were selected from the entire USSR, and 
subsequently Russia. Pilots considered it an honor to work here. 
Unfortunately, they do not consider it so at present. 
  When the new commander A. Larin came in on 6 November 1992, 
the detachment changed course in the direction of commerce. Of 
course, the times are now such that one has got to "hustle." 
Here are some examples of the new approach. 
  Recently, the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company acquired the 
French 
plane Falkon-900-B (the total amount of the contract was $32 
million; operating the plane costs $300,000-400,000 per month). 
Gazprom leased the Falkon-900-B to "detachment No. 1" so that 
this 14-passenger superliner, which Saudi sheikhs like in 
particular, would also work for Gazprom. Of course, it is 
pleasant to fly a farewell circle on such a plane over the 
undernourished, strike-bound Nadym and fly away, say, to Vienna, 
which is where representatives of the aforementioned joint-stock 
company indeed went aboard the plane. However, the same amount 
of money could have bought eight or 10 domestic planes of the 
Il-62 or Tu-154 types. 
  A. Larin liked the Falkon so much that he went to France 
together with his wife in order to learn to fly planes of this 
type, too. The president's personal pilot got carried away by 
the miracle vehicle to such a degree that he remained in that 
hospitable country through the dramatic days of 1-5 October 1993. 
  In the recent past one civil aviation directorate mastered 
one type of plane per year. Under the new management the 
"government aviation detachment" intends to master four types in 
half a year. So, highly rated specialists have been quitting the 
detachments in the belief that this is adventurism (during the 
past year more than 30 people have left, and there have been 
cases of entire crews quitting. These are the flying elite!). 
They used to think that "high turnover" and this detachment were 
two incompatible things. 
  The management of the Rossiya airline is seeking truly royal 
funding from the state. For example, 18 billion rubles have 
already been paid for two An-124's. The justification for their 
acquisition was to "develop new equipment," although at present 
the detachment operates planes of six or seven types, and it is 
not necessary to spend this kind of money on new aircraft. Seven 
billion rubles have been requested to purchase a Tu-204 plane. 
The management of the Rossiya airline intends to carry out 
service tests on the plane, although this is a function of 
service enterprises and by no means of the special aviation 
detachment. Funds have also been requested for a few Il-96's for 
scheduled rather than special flights. 
  As is known, on 3 December 1993 B. Yeltsin signed an edict 
on 
reorganizing the detachment into the Rossiya state 
transportation company, having agreed "with the proposal of the 
management and the council of the labor collective" of the 
detachment. Thereafter A. Larin announced that Rossiya does not 
report to either the Air Transportation Department or the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation, but solely to the 
president. Of course, one may not be subordinated to the 
department but one cannot fail to be guided by its documents 
concerning control and, finally, safety. This is fraught with 
consequences! We will not get away with just a "plowed field" in 
this case. 
  Where does A. Larin's "clout" come from? From his crying 
from 
the rooftops that he is a man appointed personally by the 
president. This appears to be so. As we have learned, he was 
appointed detachment commander for personal devotion to the 
president. It is interesting to know what is more important to 
B. Yeltsin: his life, which depends on a lack of 
professionalism, or servility, on which, it seems, nothing 
depends?

<F P=106> [Interview with unidentified "high-ranking officer of the </F>
former Ministry of Security" by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY special 
correspondent V. Savichev; place and date not given: "The Snail 
Effect: Former Ministry of Security Staff Must Be Cut by 42 
Percent"] 
  [Text] It is probably not necessary to explain one 
more time how difficult it is to get any information from 
"competent organs." Especially in these troubled and unstable 
times we live in. Even the anonymous interview our special 
correspondent V. Savichev held with a high-ranking officer of 
the former MB [Ministry of Security] is only one personal 
opinion regarding the processes taking place in this sphere. 
  [Savichev] In your opinion, why was the decision made to 
disband the MB? 
  [Answer] In his speech the president called the MB the last 
bulwark of totalitarianism. We have to keep in mind, however, 
that all enforcement structures in all times were created in 
accordance with the existing state model and worked for that 
model. 
  [Savichev] One gets the impression that lately they have 
been 
working in an autonomous mode. 
  [Answer] We work for the state; the consumers of our 
product--information--are concrete people in the leadership of 
that state. It is up to them to decide which part of this 
information to put to use and which to bury. 
  [Savichev] So which is it: Too little produced, or poor use? 
  [Answer] I think in the current situation it is both. 
  [Savichev] So it follows that enforcement agencies remain a 
state within a state? 
  [Answer] We have always been and will be a state within a 
state. It is a sort of a snail effect: When democrats, deputies, 
the press, or anyone else attempt to touch the soft feelers, it 
immediately instinctively retracts part of its body into its 
shell. 
  The genius of communist leaders was precisely in that they 
succeeded in creating self-contained, self-reproducing 
structures, be it the system of the party nomenklatura or 
enforcement agencies capable in a critical moment of switching 
to an autonomous mode of operation. 
  [Savichev] Then perhaps the president's decision to disband 
the MB was caused precisely by this factor? 
  [Answer] I think that the reasons for this decision were 
somewhat different. It is no secret that relations between 
enforcement structures have always been rather complicated. Each 
tried to get ahead, or sometimes even upstage colleagues from 
the neighboring agency, in order to demonstrate to the masters 
greater loyalty and get a bigger piece of the pie. This is true 
not just in our country but anywhere in the world. 
  Now, after the October events and the latest elections, the 
president has realized that he does not have a base of support. 
There is not a single more or less serious political force in 
Russia today. But there are other forces, ostensibly not 
political, that are beginning to quietly exert pressure on him. 
  The reorganization of the MB, in my opinion, indicates a 
desire to bring this agency closer under his wing in order to 
create a counterbalance to those pressuring him. 
  [Savichev] All right, B. Yeltsin made the decision, as a 
result of which half of the staff will lose their jobs. At the 
same time, the structure possesses a certain share of state 
power. Will this system be willing to self-destruct? 
  [Answer] Of course not. But at the same time the MB is not a 
political organization that puts forward ideas and attempts to 
implement them. The MB protects what already is--this is the 
specificity of its work. Besides, this system has over the past 
few years sustained considerable damage, and I do not think it 
is capable of adjusting the current external environment to meet 
its needs. More likely it will adapt to a new environment. 
  The MB is such a complex organism that amputation of any of 
its components--that is, relegating it to carrying out the 
functions enumerated in the president's decree--will have the 
most negative consequences for national security. 
  [Savichev] But the MB in the form in which it existed truly 
is a monster, and society is simply scared to live with it... 
  [Answer] People get scared when they see a huge dog only 
when 
it is not restrained, hungry, and vicious. We are an instrument 
of the state, but there is no state yet. And no idea. What are 
we to do? Yes, we are a monster. The MB of such a huge country 
should be a monster. But one has to know how to manage this 
system. 
  [Savichev] A very rich acquaintance of mine recently found 
himself in a situation of being "shoved" quite badly. So badly 
that he was not able to fend it off with the help of regular 
"specialists." The help came, through an intermediary, from 
counterintelligence professionals, who first ascertained how 
solvent he is. Well, they very quickly identified, and then 
simply squashed like flies, those racketeers. After that, they 
found their boss and warned him that, well, you are a good guy; 
we respect you and will leave you alone, but leave our people 
alone, or we will no longer respect you... Do you not think that 
if they can decide whom to respect and leave alone in the 
criminal world, they can do the same in other spheres--for 
instance, in politics? 
  [Answer] I would probably agree with you, but if we want to 
discuss this more or less seriously, one needs the facts... 
  [Savichev] I am sure there are people among your 
acquaintances who will not be hired into the new structure. What 
are their plans for the future? 
  [Answer] Plans are different, but no one intends to take a 
job in a government structure. 
  [Savichev] This leaves commercial ones. 
  [Answer] Mainly, yes. And mind you, the people who being are 
forced to take this step are quite good. 
  [Savichev] And the decisive factor, of course, is money. 
  [Answer] There is an equally important factor of resentment. 
Resentment of the way they have been treated; of what has been 
done to the great power, for whose sake they at some time risked 
their lives--and these are not just pretty words. You see, in 
the past there was at least some ideology, ideals, if you wish; 
now it is a vacuum. 
  When I cannot buy my son an expensive toy, and I see 
someone's Mercedes parked next door, I begin to think: Why do I 
need this job? I am fluent in three languages; I know how to 
work with people--take my word for it... I support democracy, 
but I fail to understand why it is that the more democracy we 
have, the more disadvantaged a man feels. 
  Still, the material factor for most people I know is not the 
goal for which they would sacrifice honor and loyalty to 
motherland... Otherwise there would be many more of those 
defections that are such a fashionable subject to write about 
these days. When I worked there, my driving force, my main 
professional instinct was to protect you all.

Russian politicians in recent years has not bypassed Vladimir 
Volfovich. But as distinct from others, he has written his, but 
he dictated it without worrying about editing and without being 
at all concerned about style or even grammar. This kind of work 
is commonly called "stream of consciousness." But this is also 
what makes it interesting. 
<H5>  The Essence of His Brain </H5>
  "This is an analytical narrative intermingled with the 
biographical canon, the quintessence of my philosophical and 
geopolitical views on modern reality. This is the essence of my 
brain, the limit I have reached in my 46 years"--this is how 
Zhirinovskiy begins his book, which he called "the last rush to 
the south" and published precisely on the eve of the December 
elections in an edition of 75,000 copies. 
  Introducing himself to the reader, Zhirinovskiy immediately 
touches upon a spot that is sensitive for him--the question of 
his paternity: "My first name is Russian--Vladimir, but my 
father was named Volf, and that is what was written on my 
father's birth certificate and passport. But mama called him 
simply Volodya and it would have been simpler for me to be named 
Vladimir Vladimirovich, but because of bureaucratism or red 
tape--I do not know, one or the other--I am Vladimir Volfovich. 
I am proud to bear any name since it is my father's name, 
although it sounds a little strange to the Russian ear." 
  Sensitivity to the "Russian ear," for which passive 
anti-Semitism is no rarity, has distinguished Zhirinovskiy since 
the very beginning of his political career. Extreme nationalism 
has also distinguished certain of his "party comrades" with whom 
he went through the early stages of the establishment of the 
LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Those who know 
Zhirinovskiy assert that in reality he has a very vulnerable 
soul and he was offended when journalists grabbed on to his slip 
of the tongue, when he said that his "mama is Russian but father 
is a lawyer." 
  The problem is that Zhirinovskiy is trying to please 
everyone 
at the same time. In a recent interview in the Israeli newspaper 
MAARIV he stated that his late father was a Jew. The leader of 
the LDPR added: "Jews are in a special position in Russia. 
Ninety percent of the Leninist party were Jews and 90 percent of 
the members of my party are Jews as well." 
  In general Zhirinovskiy's book could serve as an ideal aid 
for people studying psychoanalysis. Here is a little example of 
his recollections of day nurseries in Almaty: "I recall how we 
were awakened at 2300 in the evening. They put us to bed at 2100 
and awakened us at 2300 to make sure that we urinated in the 
bucket. The boys went to urinate in one bucket and the girls in 
another. And that was perhaps the first time, at three or four 
years of age, that something sexual stirred in me, when I saw 
girls completely naked." 
  And here is how political thinking awakened in the young 
Zhirinovskiy: "I ran through the corridor of the kindergarten 
and saw the attendants standing by the loudspeaker...they were 
standing there and weeping. It seemed that they had just 
received information that somewhere in Moscow a certain Stalin 
had died. And to me, a child, of course, who still knew 
absolutely nothing about politics, it was quite incomprehensible 
why so far from Moscow, in the corridor of the kindergarten, 
adult people, attendants, nurses, teachers--were standing there 
and weeping...perhaps this was my first flash of political 
awareness, my first protest against the personality cult." 
<H5>  The Institute </H5>
  Since childhood the young Volodya was pursued by the dream 
of 
getting away from the backwater Almaty, from his family, where 
he was the sixth child, to run away from his stepfather whom he 
did not like (his father died when the boy was less than a year 
old). Zhirinovskiy wanted to become a diplomat or at least an 
officer. "Ultimately...I decided to go to Moscow and enter if 
not the MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International 
Relations] then its Eastern version--the Institute of Eastern 
Languages under Moscow State University." 
  In 1964 when the 18-year-old Zhirinovskiy crossed the 
threshold of the Sovetskiy Rayon Committee of the VLKSM 
[All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] of Almaty in order to 
obtain a character reference for admission to Moscow State 
University, he assured the Komsomol leaders that he would still 
"become the pride of Kazakhstan." True, he received average 
marks on his entrance examinations to the Institute of Eastern 
Languages at Moscow State University, where he was assigned the 
Turkish language, which is not difficult to study and not very 
promising on the level of further work. 
<H5>  Dark Spots in the Biography </H5>
  Zhirinovskiy was a good student, even excellent, and 
therefore it is not surprising that he was sent for temporary 
duty in Turkey for the construction of the metallurgical combine 
in Iskenderun. We do not know precisely what happened there. 
Zhirinovskiy himself in a conversation with one of the authors 
said the following in this regard: "The Turks wanted to accuse 
me of disseminating communist propaganda because I gave a Turk a 
badge on which, they thought, was a picture of Karl Marx. And 
when they understood that they were mistaken and that the badge 
depicted Pushkin, they apologized to me." But that is his 
version. 
  And although Zhirinovskiy asserts that he never spent time 
in 
a Turkish jail, it was with considerable difficulty that he was 
rescued from the clutches of the Turkish authorities. To be sent 
out of a country at midnight for any reason meant, at the 
beginning of the seventies, the end of one's career, even if it 
had not begun. According to recollections of Zhirinovskiy's 
teachers and fellow students, before this trip he was a cheerful 
person and a joker, but he returned anxious and morally broken. 
  Zhirinovskiy had no hope of any more trips abroad, even as a 
translator, but nonetheless he found the strength within himself 
to graduate from the Institute (with honors), after which he was 
drafted into the army for two years and sent to Tbilisi, where 
he served as a staff officer. 
<H5>  Was Zhirinovskiy a Member? </H5>
  With his reverent attitude toward communist ideals even 
today, God himself willed Zhirinovskiy to be in the party, but 
still he remained a "nonparty communist." Why? People who know 
him say that he tried to enter several times, but...his grim, 
quarrelsome disposition and his squabbles with those around him 
made it impossible for him to do this even in the army where it 
was not difficult to enter the party, especially for an officer 
working in specialized propaganda. And after that, when he 
became a "private citizen," working in institutions where there 
were long waiting lists to enter the CPSU, he could not even 
dream about it. 
  The fact that he was not in the party served as an excuse 
for 
him to leave the Committee for Defense of Peace, where he worked 
for two years as a translator after leaving the army. 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy and the KGB </H5>
  The fact that the future leader of the LDPR was not in the 
CPSU predetermines the answer to the question of whether or not 
he was a "combatant on the invisible front." At least he was not 
a staff worker. This required going through training in a secret 
KGB school, which Zhirinovskiy did not manage to do in spite of 
all his attraction to training. 
  Here is what one of his former deputies and close advisers 
in 
the LDPR, Leonid Alimov, has to say about this: "I do not think 
he could be a KGB worker. For some reasons which only he knows, 
he is extremely afraid of the committee. But Zhirinovskiy has 
met with its workers repeatedly. When he went to Vologda and 
Chita during his election campaign, the first place he went was 
to the local KGB division." 
  Zhirinovskiy, however, considers all discussion of his work 
in the KGB to be intrigues of bearded journalists and members of 
Democratic Russia: "They are all bedeviled by the fact that I 
was in neither the party nor the KGB nor the nomenklatura! This 
bedevils them because they themselves all came from insane 
asylums, jails, or out of immigration. I am a rare bird among 
them." 
<H5>  Diagnosis: Political Figure </H5>
  Zhirinovskiy has apparently always been a "rare bird." Even 
as a second-year student he went to the rector of the institute 
with a plan for reorganizing all Eastern studies education in 
the USSR. They slapped him on the shoulder and sent him back to 
study some more. But he was not satisfied with this. "On 15 
April 1967," he writes in his book, "I sent a letter to the CPSU 
Central Committee and in an address to the country's leaders I 
suggested conducting reforms in the areas of agriculture, 
education, and industry." In the view of psychiatric specialists 
who have observed Zhirinovskiy's career from the very beginning, 
this person needs "light psychiatric treatment or consultations 
with a psychoanalyst. One can state with a great deal of 
confidence that his difficult childhood and lack of a father 
were subsequently manifested in the development in the 
personality of delusions of grandeur and a fervor for reform. 
  "In principle the desire to be known and the wish to reform 
society are not in and of themselves a manifestation of a 
psychological illness. But their sharply expressed form and an 
inclination to exaggerate indicate psychological deviations 
inherent in a given individual." 
  His hysterical behavior, which is especially marked in his 
speeches in the Duma, and the physical violence that has begun 
to attract him recently are causing alarm even among his 
supporters. Zhirinovskiy himself when speaking with one of the 
authors of this article answered a question about this as 
follows: "I am prepared at any time to undergo an official 
examination of my health. I suggested having this done even 
before the presidential elections. Let the best doctors of 
Russia give a complete diagnosis from head to toe. I am ready. 
All these insulting tricks do not affect me." 
  The problem, however, is that Zhirinovskiy is constantly 
changing his image. First he is a communist by conviction, then 
a democrat, first he is in favor of the State Committee for the 
State of Emergency, then he is against it, first he is for 
peace, and then he is for war.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Dikun: "Lukava To Open the Duma"] </F>
  [Text] According to the new Constitution of the 
Russian Federation, the first sitting of the State Duma will be 
opened by the most senior deputy in terms of years. This is 
Georgiy Lukava, a candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  BIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE. Georgiy Grigoryevich Lukava was 
born in 1925 in Tbilisi, in an office worker's family. As he 
himself says, "My name is Georgian, my upbringing, Russian." He 
graduated from the Lenin Military-Political Academy and also 
completed graduate work at the academy in philosophy. He is a 
professor and doctor of philosophical sciences. The subject of 
his thesis was "The Nature of the Contradictions in Armed 
Struggle Involving the Use of Nuclear Weapons." The subject of 
his doctorate was "Dialectics of the Theory and Practice of the 
Art of War." He worked in the Philosophy Department of the Lenin 
Military-Political Academy and was for 16 years deputy head of 
the Frunze Military Academy Social Sciences Department. He is 
currently head of the Department of Liberal Arts and 
Sociopolitical Sciences of the Moscow University of Civil 
Aviation Engineers. He is married with two children. 
  My first question concerned the professor's party 
affiliation. He is a member of the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation, apparently, not a "Zhirinovskiy hawk." His 
Majesty Chance brought Lukava and the Liberal Democratic Party 
together. Several months ago the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
held the conference "Russia's Economic, Political, and Spiritual 
Crisis, and Solutions to It." Lukava was invited to speak also 
(it should be mentioned that he is a person well known around 
political teach-in's and does not, as he himself acknowledges, 
pass up a single roundtable or activity of various parties and 
movements "in order to be au courant with the debate and with 
what is said on this issue or the other by Baburin, Isakov, 
Umalatova, and Shakhray"). Georgiy Grigoryevich delivered a 
report on the subject "Spiritual Readiness and Its Role in 
Surmounting the Crisis." His speech went down well, by all 
accounts. "Leader Zhirinovskiy himself shook my hand and thanked 
me," Lukava warmly recalls. "True, he had nothing else to say, 
nor did I ask any questions. I am a tactful sort." 
  Meanwhile, the LDP's ideas struck home with Lukava, so to 
speak, and he set about studying its rules and program 
documents. "I, like many communists, had a superficial idea of 
this party, mainly from newspaper articles and television 
programs, but I learned here that the LDP's program coincides 70 
percent with the programs of the Communist Party, the Russian 
National Union, and other patriotic organizations." 
  Nor, for their part, did the Zhirinovskiyites forget Lukava. 
When the campaign began, Georgiy Grigoryevich received a call 
from LPD headquarters: "We have been conferring here and have 
decided to ask you to be a candidate for deputy from our party." 
Lukava thought about it for two days, after which he agreed. 
  The professor shares far from all of Zhirinovskiy's views. 
He 
believes, for example, that "there is an element of insufficient 
balance" in certain pronouncements of the LDP leader on foreign 
policy matters, Finland's annexation to Russia, say. But Georgiy 
Grigoryevich categorically disagrees that Zhirinovskiy is 
preaching fascist ideas. In his view, some people want simply 
from a feeling of envy to discredit Vladimir Volfovich's good 
name. 
  Lukava sees as one of his tasks the building of a bridge of 
friendship between the Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov camps. "I would 
like all that is strong in the Liberal Democratic Party to be 
linked with the same strong aspects and representatives of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation." That Communist Party 
leader Zyuganov recently declared for all to hear the readiness 
of the communists to interact with the healthy forces of the LDP 
he considers his contribution, to some extent. 
  Today all Lukava's thoughts are taken up with what he will 
say to his deputy colleagues on the opening day of the Duma. 
Georgiy Grigoryevich has not yet set about writing his speech, 
but he has some advance ideas in mind. "I will, of course, 
confer with those who nominated me for parliament, with Vladimir 
Volfovich included. Elementary decency on my part implies this." 
No recommendations from Zhirinovskiy have been received as yet. 
  The professor intends in his speech to appeal simultaneously 
to both the intellect and the feelings of the deputies. "I want 
by the method of emotional impact to create a certain intensity 
in the hall." Lukava is thinking of employing as a means of 
emotional impact "elements of spiritual culture," including 
musical works. "It pleased me greatly that at the Soviet Embassy 
reception at the time of the Genoa Conference, Chicherin, 
people's commissar for foreign affairs, played Beethoven's 
[begins italics]Apassionata and Chaykovskiy's 1812 
Overture." 
  Georgiy Grigoryevich feels little awkwardness at the sorry 
fate that befell the previous parliament. To the question as to 
whether he expected a similar end for the present Duma, he 
replied in purely philosophical terms: "From the standpoint of 
the great Leibniz, historical analogies do not recur within the 
framework of the absolute." 
  It is pleasant talking with a man of depth....

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriya Novodvorskaya, leader of the </F>
Democratic Union of Russia Party, by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY 
correspondent A. Sargin, under the rubric "Lady in Politics"; 
place and date not given: "V. Novodvorskaya: `I Would Become a 
Nun, but There Are Other Things To Do First'"] 
  [Text] A two-room Khrushchev-era "slum" on the 
outskirts of Maryina Roscha. The entire furnishings consist of a 
bed, a bookcase, and a desk. Portraits on the walls: Christ, 
Yeltsin, Gamsakhurdia. Books everywhere, especially on the desk. 
Also there--a small Colt. This was the setting of a meeting 
between our correspondent and the Democratic Union of Russia 
Party's leader, Valeriya Novodvorskaya. 
  [Sargin] Valeriya Ilyinichna, what is the meaning of this 
Colt in a cozy home environment? 
  [Novodvorskaya] When the KGB used to come time and again to 
arrest me, I would immediately grab this gun. I carried it to 
rallies and I remember how an officer in the militia cordon 
laughed when he checked my purse and found out that this Colt 
was just a plastic toy. 
  [Sargin] Can you tell us a little about your family? 
  [Novodvorskaya] I have lived in this "slum" with my mother 
and grandmother since 1966. My mother is a physician, my 
grandmother--a former medical assistant; all are fiery 
supporters of the president. We also have a cat named Stas. 
Stasik, naturally, does not have any party affiliation, but I 
remember that he used to react very nervously to Khasbulatov 
whenever he was on television. The cat would begin to growl 
unpleasantly (at that moment Stas walked into the room and 
started making mischief. V. Novodvorskaya picked him up and 
said: "Do you not see we are working? Leave us alone; what are 
you, some communist?"--A.S.) 
  [Sargin] Pardon me, do you have a friend or a girlfriend? 
  [Novodvorskaya] My God, are you trying to ask me whether I 
am 
a lesbian? No. I am quite indifferent to both homosexual and 
heterosexual love. 
  I recognize normal human friendship, normal human relations. 
That is, when it comes to chastity, I would probably meet the 
standards of the creators of the young builders of communism 
code of conduct. I can say with certainty that sex does not 
exist. If not for Russia, then at least for me and my immediate 
circle. I am not interested in it. I think under different 
circumstances a person with such Christian principles would 
retire to a monastery, because for me this would be a perfect 
thing. It is just that other things have to be done first. 
  [Sargin] Who are you by education? 
  [Novodvorskaya] A philologist, in Roman-Germanic languages. 
Actually, a "catacomb" historian, because although formally my 
education is in philology, my knowledge of history is of course 
much greater. Therefore at Afanasyev's university, at RGGU 
[expansion unidentified] I teach history and philosophy rather 
than philology. I know Latin, ancient Greek, French; can read 
German, English, and Italian. To learn to speak these languages 
I would need to have spent less time in prison and more time in 
contact with foreigners. 
  [Sargin] Have you been arrested often? 
  [Novodvorskaya] Well, let us start with three rounds under 
Article 70 alone, which was quite a rarity in the Soviet Union. 
After all, I am 43, not 60. Then some small stuff like Article 
190 Point 2--defacing the state flag. This was under Gorbachev. 
Then if you count just arrests for participation in rallies--17 
instances of 15-day detentions over two years, this alone adds 
up to more than eight months. 
  [Sargin] Did they beat you in prison? 
  [Novodvorskaya] They no longer do that in the post-Stalin 
times. In Lefortovo they do not engage in beatings at all--they 
have other ways of talking to you. Those who ended up in special 
prisons such as "Kazan" were simply tortured, but in a much more 
sophisticated way--for instance, the dental drill, oxygen 
injection under the skin, or electroshock. They do not use such 
primitive methods as beating. 
  [Sargin] What is it--a "dental drill"? 
  [Novodvorskaya] This is a classic: They drill healthy teeth 
until the drill bit pierces your jaw. 
  [Sargin] Valeriya Ilyinichna, did your family say to you 
when 
you ended up in prison time after time: "See! Did we not warn 
you: Live quietly!"? 
  [Novodvorskaya] At first they did, then they stopped, 
because 
it was useless. My first arrest was in 1969. And the whole thing 
started in 1968. 
  [Sargin] Your credo is opposition. Now you are loyal to the 
current authority. Why such a dramatic turn? 
  [Novodvorskaya] Our credo is not opposition--it is freedom. 
If freedom and authority diverge, we are in opposition. If 
freedom and opposition diverge, we are with the authority. 
Russia is indeed a unique country. I think this is the first 
time in history that freedom's ways have diverged from those of 
the opposition rather than those of the authorities. Now the 
authority is in opposition, We have to take reality into 
account. If one goes blindly like a bull for the red cloth, for 
the sake of going in the direction of opposition, we may end up 
with red brigades. 
  [Sargin] Will the elections in Russia have an effect on the 
fate of CIS republics? 
  [Novodvorskaya] If the CIS countries have power over their 
own fate, then of course the elections would have an impact. But 
I question very much their ability to control their destiny, 
because in Ukraine those who make the decisions are not Khmara 
or Chornovil--who could indeed make an impact on the destiny of 
their republic--but rather "homo sovietica" from southern and 
eastern Ukraine who voted for Kravchuk. 
  What is the Union of Independent States? On the one hand, a 
democratic Russia; on the other--Ukraine, which is also "more or 
less;" Belarus is a communist preserve but in a presentable 
form; next comes feudal Turkmenistan; and next--routine 
communism in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. What kind of union is 
this? Georgia, which is in a state of civil war, is being 
dragged into the CIS. What are we going to get from it except 
trouble? Is Karabakh not enough for us? We should not drag 
anybody anywhere. We need to sign mutually profitable agreements. 
  [Sargin] Perhaps for Shevardnadze this was the last chance 
to 
stop war. 
  [Novodvorskaya] Shevardnadze should know his people a little 
better. This is not Azerbaijan, which calmed down under G. 
Aliyev. Last year I visited Georgia, and I now know their 
attitude toward Russians. I conducted rallies and discussions 
there; I had a gorgeous transparency in Georgian: "Shevardnadze 
Is the Butcher of Georgian People" and "Down With Shevardnadze's 
Fascist Junta." 
  [Sargin] Did you end up in prison there as well? 
  [Novodvorskaya] How can you fail to get thrown in prison in 
Georgia? In Georgia you end up either dead or in prison; no 
other options. 
  During my 21-day stay in Georgia I was arrested four times 
and beaten up three times (the last time they kicked me with 
their feet until I lost consciousness). I never had a concussion 
while in Russia. I spent the day of the free elections there, in 
which 30 percent of population participated and which under 
Shevardnadze was held under the sights of submachine guns, in an 
underground prison. 
  [Sargin] Is it true that you were nearly raped there? 
  [Novodvorskaya] No. I do not think that I would satisfy the 
taste of Georgian Mkhedrioni. Thankfully, I am not that young 
and not that good looking, so I do not think there is any such 
danger for me. Sazhi Umalatova is the one who is always afraid 
of being raped because she is beautiful, slim, and blond. 
  [Sargin] What is your reaction to report about Z. 
Gamsakhurdia's death? 
  [Novodvorskaya] Zviad died in battle. I know him: Suicide is 
250 percent impossible. If he did not kill himself in the 
seventies and eighties, why do it now? He has a greater safety 
margin than Solzhenitsyn. Z. Gamsakhurdia's suicide would mean 
destroying with his own hands the cause of his entire life. I 
will never believe that he would throw down the drain such a 
wonderful opportunity as his own death. 
  I think that what is involved here is a design on the part 
of 
the Georgian and what remains of the Russian special services. 
Shevardnadze did not have a guarantee that if necessary Russia 
would not trade him for Zviad. Suicide is an elementary trick of 
special services, although in our country Pugo managed to put 
his gun on a night table after he killed himself, and Akhromeyev 
hung himself with a gun on hand. 
  What happened in Georgia is precisely what our dear friends 
in civilized Western countries advise us to do now. Gamsakhurdia 
followed their advice and... Western advice comes from 
incompetent and weak people. When they give us advice on 
economics, we should listen, because they are knowledgeable in 
this subject. However, with respect to our political affairs, 
the destiny of Russia, they will never understand anything. 
Russia's special road is a very sudden route of building a 
liberal society. 
  Russia was hurt most by the "wedding feast" in the Kremlin 
Palace of Congresses on election night. I cannot think of an 
adequate punishment for the organizers of this stupidity. One 
cannot sit down at the same table as fascists and communists. 
Because those who sit down with them later are sent to gas 
chambers. And in principle for a good reason--for cowardice, 
weakness, spinelessness, and lack of principles. 
  [Sargin] Was this not an attempt on the part of the current 
authority to reconcile with the new opposition? 
  [Novodvorskaya] There cannot be a reconciliation between 
reds 
and whites in Russia during civil war. We must win now and not 
think about the price. We have pulled the genie out of the 
bottle; now we have to learn to control it, because genies do 
not listen to the weak. In Russia they shoot exhausted horses; 
and in Russia people do not resign--they fade into oblivion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Fedorov, president of Chuvashia, by </F>
ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentina Ivanova, place and date not 
given: "Chuvashia Can Only Develop as a Part of Russia"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Fedorovich, 35-year-old former minister of 
justice of Russia elected president of Chuvashia at the end of 
December of last year, gives his first interview in his new 
position. 
  [Ivanova] Nikolay Vasilyevich, now we have behind us the 
fierce election campaign which crowned a two-year presidential 
marathon in Chuvashia. Now you stand one on one facing the 
urgent problems of the republic. On a purely human level, is it 
not somewhat frightening to be taking on such an unbelievably 
heavy load? 
  [Fedorov] Why talk about this now? The choice has been made. 
By me--prior to entering the presidential marathon. And by the 
people of the republic--on election day. The president must bear 
this load proceeding from the fact that the stage of destruction 
of Russia has long since "passed" historically and it is time to 
shift over to construction. Secondly, we must not take more 
people hostage to the political and personal confrontation 
between these and those people. I have therefore accepted the 
post of president of Chuvashia and am proposing accord and 
professional compromise with all movements and social groups in 
the name of the survival of society. 
  [Ivanova] In your view, where are the greatest "sore points" 
in Chuvashia? 
  [Fedorov] There are very many of these, as there are 
throughout Russia. Sociological surveys show, however, that 
first place is occupied by the problem of crime and citizen 
safety. Here fate itself commands me--as a legal specialist--to 
get seriously and fundamentally involved in this business. It is 
a universal problem which would seem to be outside the realm of 
economics, but it is precisely here where matters involving 
corruption and the intricate processes of privatization, for 
example, come together, and everywhere we must see to it that 
the law and strict compliance with it stand paramount. 
  We will fight especially hard for the interests of our 
land's 
(both Russia and Chuvashia) commodity producers as they face 
foreign competitors. Chuvashia has traditionally been considered 
an agrarian republic, but in recent decades we have developed a 
powerful industry capable of competing on the world market in a 
number of items. We simply have to assist it appropriately by 
adjusting federal government policy through our initiatives. 
  Can it be considered normal, for example, that the 
Cheboksary 
Industrial Tractor Plant, built some time ago by the entire 
country, is almost idle due to problems with the marketing of 
the powerful steel machines, while Russia purchases American 
tractors, exporting Russian raw materials and obtaining credits 
from the West? I see my own responsibility in safeguarding from 
destruction the Cheboksary Tractor Plant, and the chemical 
sector, and the enterprises of instrument manufacture, 
electrical engineering, and machine building. This is task 
number one--and not just for the industry of Chuvashia itself. 
Protecting the competitiveness of the economy is extremely 
important for Russia's tomorrow as well, for its might and 
dignity as a great power. 
  Our plans call for attracting into the Chuvash 
economy--primarily into its agrarian sector--both Russian and 
foreign investments, in order to create joint enterprises with 
competitive technologies which yield swift returns in storing 
and processing agricultural output, more than half of which is 
presently being lost. One of the programs coming soon which will 
help the republic better carry out economic reform and enter the 
market more quickly is the beginning of construction, jointly 
with federal organs, of a modern road system and telephone 
network in the republic. The accomplishment of these tasks will 
also help us maintain job positions, push unemployment into the 
background, and hold on to individuals with unique specialties. 
  One additional "categorical imperative" for me is the 
protection of buildings and culture. We will put our material 
resources, minimal at present, primarily into the spiritual 
sphere, into education. And we will pursue this course even at 
the expense of certain tasks of the moment. I am convinced that 
these expenditures will tomorrow pay us back a hundredfold. 
  [Ivanova] But is the president able to handle all this? 
After 
all, he must act under conditions of a complex system of 
separation of powers, being guided by the Constitution of 
Chuvashia and the Russian Constitution. 
  [Fedorov] We will be able to resolve a great many problems 
if 
it is not the president governing what we do, but the law. Much 
depends also on the ability of politicians to view history in 
perspective, to reach agreement with their partners and avoid 
turning personal problems into political ones. 
  [Ivanova] Nikolay Vasilyevich, I cannot help but ask a 
question which was posed to you at meetings with voters during 
the presidential elections: Will the fact that you voluntarily 
resigned the post of minister of justice of Russia and seem to 
have come into conflict with the Russian president not have a 
negative effect on the Russian attitude towards the republic? 
  [Fedorov] My departure was a protest against illegal methods 
being used in the resolution of many state issues. And of 
course, this did not come easy for me. After all, I was 
completely preoccupied with the reforms, being the most "senior" 
in tenure, appointed four times in a row as minister of the 
Russian Government. What can you do? This kind of thing happens 
in politics too--Boris Nikolayevich and I split over what was 
permissible in politics and what was not. He and I have always 
had a frank and equal relationship on the purely human level, 
and it remains so today. Herein lies the value and worth of our 
mutual relations. 
  Something else says a great deal, I believe--the fact that 
he 
sent me a kind telegram, congratulating me upon having been 
elected the first president of Chuvashia and expressing the 
expectation of "constructive work together." So we should not be 
talking about any confrontation here. And with regard to 
questions of economic reform, and of strengthening the 
constitutional system and genuine federation in Russia, Boris 
Nikolayevich has my steadfast support. 
  [Ivanova] In other words, Chuvashia continues to be an 
entity 
of the Federation and has no intention of separating in any way? 
  [Fedorov] There can be no discussion in this regard. He who 
fights for separation will not resolve a single problem for his 
people, and will create thousands of new explosive problems 
instead. We must not turn national into nationalistic. I myself 
was born in a large Chuvash family and I proudly relate to this 
everywhere I go. We will continue to support national pride and 
dignity, continue to develop the culture and traditions of the 
Chuvash people. But in doing so we will not permit people of 
other nationalities to feel uncomfortable--this too is the 
political, legal, and moral responsibility of the president. 
  Chuvashia has a fine national custom: nime (mutual 
assistance, mutual support). We would like to revive and protect 
this custom. But I am confident we can only do so along the path 
of accord. I am convinced that Chuvashia can develop, can truly 
prosper, only if it is a part of Russia. Just as Russia remains 
strong by virtue of the power of republics, krays, and oblasts 
that comprise it, through the unity of their diversity.

<F P=106> [Report by INTERFAX: "Yakutia Will Establish a Diamond </F>
Exchange Before the End of January 1994"] 
  [Text] An edict on establishing a diamond exchange in 
Yakutia (a republic belonging to the Russian Federation in the 
northeastern part of Siberia) will be signed by President of the 
Republic Mikhail Nikolayev before the end of January. Vyacheslav 
Shtyrov, vice president of the republic and chairman of the 
Yakutia Government, informed INTERFAX of this. 
  In November 1993, the Yakutia Government and 16 producers of 
cut diamonds, jewelry, and tools in which diamonds are used 
agreed to set up a diamond exchange which, according to 
documents, is being established to "hold trading sessions, 
auctions, and wholesale and retail sale of products made of 
cuttable and industrial diamonds, precious metals and stones, 
and as a secondary market for the sale of rough diamonds." 
According to Pavel Andreyev, the president of the exchange who 
heads the republic association of exporters, Sakhaeksport, it is 
planned to hold the first session on the exchange, which will be 
located in the capital of the republic, Yakutsk, in February of 
this year. 
  Experts from Yakutia project that the volume of sales on the 
exchange in 1994 may come to $50 million. It is planned to sell 
cut diamonds and jewelry worth $15 million at the first trading 
session. 
  All diamonds for the first trading session will be 
manufactured by cutters especially brought in from Belgium, as 
well as from Kiev and Smolensk. They have been commissioned to 
manufacture up to 10 cut diamonds, the cost of each of which may 
reach $1 million. 
  The Yakutia diamond exchange has been founded as a privately 
held joint-stock company with the statutory capital of 1 billion 
rubles [R] (the republic accounts for virtually the entire 
volume of diamond production in Russia). However, the initial 
statutory capital will be smaller by a factor of two--R500 
million. This is due to the fact that most producers of 
diamonds, jewelry, and tools using industrial diamonds do not 
have sufficient financial resources at present. 
  According to Prime Minister Vasiliy Shtyrov, the delay in M. 
Nikolayev's edict (it was expected as early as the end of 
November 1993, after a meeting of the founders of the 
exchange--note by INTERFAX) has been caused by the desire to 
coordinate the actions with the international association of 
diamond exchanges. According to charter documents of the 
exchange, the Yakutia Government will receive 30 percent of the 
stock, the face value of which will come to 5 million rubles. 
The rest of the founders will hold 3 to 7 percent of the stock.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chechen Republic President Dzhokhar Dudayev </F>
by Vakhtang Dzhanashiya, under the rubric "Separatists"; place 
and date not given: "The Dark, the Secret, the Imperial... 
Dzhokhar Dudayev Unmasks the Culprits in All Troubles"] 
  [Text] [Dzhanashiya] Dzhokhar, the situation in Chechnya is 
very aggravated... 
  [Dudayev] We have operational data to the effect that the 
secret chancery has prepared a scenario that will unfold within 
days. Here, in Groznyy, they kill, slash, and bayonet, and do 
nothing else. We should make a choice: Either to lead the 
nations to rebuff any aggression that the personnel of the 
secret, dark imperial chancery are preparing, or surrender 
voluntarily into colonial slavery for yet another century. There 
is nothing in between in this instance. The supreme command of 
all special services, including the Armed Forces, and Yeltsin's 
team have developed a scenario for a blockade and stepped-up 
terrorism and subversion within Chechnya, with combat action 
beginning subsequently. There are some young gung-ho generals 
who are saying: "I will enter Chechnya!" However, they should be 
asked how they will withdraw. They have already entered Chechnya 
and Afghanistan many times, but they have withdrawn badly. They 
have withdrawn very badly. 
  [Dzhanashiya] With some justification, they are apprehensive 
about the "first shot" in Chechnya, where the blood-feud 
tradition is strong and there are many weapons. 
  [Dudayev] An assessment of the situation, a projection, an 
analysis, and a civic position--and in this case, there should 
be no shooting, no woes, and no tears. This is the strongest 
weapon of the time. Moscow is stuffing all republics of the 
Caucasus with weapons on all pretexts for subversion and for 
fueling wars. Later, disinformation is spread to the effect that 
the weapons came from Chechnya, as if they were produced here 
rather than in Russia. Chechnya itself fights the importation of 
weapons, fights thousands of units of weapons, drugs, and funds. 
These weapons are being spread in precisely the same manner 
throughout the Caucasus--everybody is being stuffed with nuclear 
charges. The secret chancery is perfecting the fueling of enmity 
between peoples along national, territorial, ethnic, cultural, 
and spiritual lines. There will be no mercy, just as there has 
been none to date. The last aggressive forces of the imperial 
chancery have put everything at stake to maintain 
totalitarianism at any price, to break the will of democracy for 
a normal life among the nations in this imperfect world by the 
methods of intimidation, physical violence, terror, subversion, 
and provocations. This is my position, and may the Almighty 
grant us that everything will be brighter then I expect. 
  [Dzhanashiya] Do you have specific, substantiated complaints 
about the leadership of Russia? 
  [Dudayev] We should grasp clearly that methods used by the 
so-called "new democratic forces" are so sophisticated and 
perfidious that the mentality of a Soviet man is not prepared 
for them. When Yeltsin and his team fought the empire of the 
USSR, all nations of the Caucasus, and not just the Caucasus, 
supported these endeavors. This is how democracy won. The 
nations of the Caucasus stood in the same ranks with democracy, 
and many manned the barricades. It was a most profound delusion 
that days of a democratic thaw would come as soon as the Supreme 
Soviet, which was so easily and simply shot up, became a thing 
of the past. It turns out that a draft of the new constitution, 
new far-fetched elections were being prepared in the dark 
offices contrary to all common sense and laws of human 
community. These elections are not legitimate in any way based 
on a multitude of attributes of international law, absolutely 
not legitimate. Their objective is simple: to suppress the will 
of Caucasians through the force of physical pressure so that 
they will obey the dictatorship of power of the new empire. It 
is no accident that a few days ago a film about the training of 
the internal troops was shown on TV in which it was 
blasphemously announced that these guys had been in Khodzhaly, 
Tajikistan, and Ingushetia. There were the same painted mugs, 
the same bad element, the same brutal faces covered from the 
camera, the same scenario. We should decide: either civil 
courage, or slavery; and we should make this decision in the 
most severe times of provocations, subversion, and terror on an 
immense scale, emanating from the secret black chancery of the 
former empire. This chancery has no intention of sparing the 
nations, including the Russian, in order to once again throw the 
people on their knees at any price, and onto the path of a 
totalitarian regime in a new cycle of so-called democracy. I 
will venture to assure you--no mercy will be shown. Such are the 
realities. 
  [Dzhanashiya] Do you have specific constructive proposals 
for 
improving relations with Russia? 
  [Dudayev] My specific proposals are outlined in the book 
Thorny Path to Freedom, which has been published. The 
main point is the recognition of the independence of Chechnya. 
  [Dzhanashiya] What is your attitude toward the CNC 
[Confederation of the Nations of the Caucasus]? 
  [Dudayev] This is the only force that has stabilized the 
situation in the entire Caucasus to some degree, and I attach 
great hopes to it. I raised at a CNC congress the issue of 
granting the status of Supreme Soviet deputies of their 
republics to members of the CNC parliament in the republics of 
Northern Caucasus. 
  [Dzhanashiya] Most nations of the CNC are in favor of 
staying 
within Russia. At the same time, you are resolutely fighting for 
independence. Is there not a contradiction? 
  [Dudayev] Oh no. The expression of the will of the people 
should be the foundation. If a nation wants to belong to 
Russia--Godspeed! If the Chechens do not want to, there should 
be "Godspeed" too! However, it is very hard to be together with 
the current Russia, in which subversion, terrorism, and 
provocation have been elevated to the rank of a state policy. I 
do not know who voluntarily wants to go there, into such a 
Russia. Let Russia achieve legitimacy and democratic legal 
institutions, let it become capable of respecting its own laws, 
primarily within itself, and later it will be possible to 
conduct a dialogue with it concerning mutual relations. 
  [Dzhanashiya] To your mind, what are the prospects for the 
development of the Caucasus situation? 
  [Dudayev] The Caucasus is, after all, the oldest 
civilization 
on the globe in the last 50 million years. The civilization of 
the future should belong to it. It is precisely the nations of 
the Caucasus that have preserved the ages-old traditions of 
morality, spirituality, humanity, philanthropy, tactfulness, and 
intellect. The Almighty is preserving this genetic pool in order 
to regulate normal relations in the future. The stimulator of 
mutual relations for the world is here, in the Caucasus. All of 
this through freedom. Freedom is the loftiest possession of man.

<F P=106> ["Program of the Government of Moscow for 1994"] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  The government of Moscow notes that as a whole the tasks 
defined by the program for 1993 were resolved successfully. 
  The main systems of the city administration worked in a 
stable manner (power industry, transport, water supply, and 
housing and municipal services). 
  Sufficiently high investment activity and volume of housing 
and social-cultural construction were continued in the city. 
Housing area input totaled 3 million square meters, and 25 
schools, two elementary class units, 27 kindergartens, 15 
polyclinics, and five hospital buildings were put into 
operation, 68 stores and 218 public catering establishments were 
built and have started to function, 12 hothouses were put into 
operation in the sovkhoz of the Moscow Soviet, the Palace of 
Justice building was built, and the crackers plant was put into 
operation. 
  Moscow celebrated Victory Day on Poklonnaya Hill, where the 
first section of the memorial complex was built. 
  The Kazanskiy Cathedral was reconstructed on Red Square in 
1993. 
  Construction began on the center of the city, where more 
than 
800,000 square meters of buildings were put into operation. 
  The volume of capital repair of roads, which totaled 18.5 
million square meters, was overfulfilled by 23.3 percent. 
  Major repairs were accomplished on 2.0 million square meters 
of living space, and the volume of construction and 
reconstruction of engineering networks increased. 
  Social protection of Muscovites was a subject of special 
attention on the part of the Government of Moscow. In accordance 
with a special purpose program, various types of social 
assistance were provided to 3,614,500 persons. This is every 
third Muscovite. 
  On the whole in the last year more than 92 billion rubles 
[R] 
was expended for these purposes (of this amount, R62 billion 
came from the budgetary resources of the city). 
  The largest sums were directed to differential supplementary 
pension payments to nonworking pensioners--R25 billion, and to 
food subsidies for pupils of grades 1-11 at Moscow schools--R15 
billion. 
  During the year, expenditures on the conduct of sanitary 
measures with children increased substantially in comparison 
with the initial proposals, totaling more than R7 billion. 
  Assistance unprecedented in scale was rendered in 1993 to 
organs of internal affairs. More than R45 billion and $8 million 
were expended on reinforcing the material base of the militia 
and fitting it out with modern equipment. Thirty-seven 
facilities were built, including 21 militia offices, which makes 
it possible to require that personnel of the GUVD [Main 
Administration of Internal Affairs] make qualitative changes 
regarding the fight against crime and control over public order. 
  Economic reforms were conducted more actively than in 1992. 
The share of nonstate enterprises at present totals more than 85 
percent in trade turnover and motor vehicle freight shipments, 
in construction--more than 90 percent, and in industrial 
production--50 percent. 
  With all the complexities of the budgetary-financial 
situation, the Government of Moscow financed all the measures 
planned in the 1993 program. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  The conditions for the development of the economy of the 
city 
and the functioning of city services will be more complicated in 
1994. The economic crisis and drop in production continue, and 
inflation is being maintained at a high rate. However, the 
Government of Moscow believes that the city has a stable system 
of administration, resources, and reserves for continuing and 
developing positive trends, stabilizing the city's economy, and 
resolving worthwhile socioeconomic tasks. 
  The measures outlined by the program of the government of 
Moscow for 1994 are directed to this end. 
<H5>  III. </H5>
  In the social sphere, the government intends: 
  --to develop the system existing in the city for social 
support of the low income strata of the population by indexing, 
in accordance with inflation, the scales of allowances for 
pensioners, students, and children, and subsidies for food and 
medicine in schools, preschool institutions, and hospitals. It 
is planned to increase the share of the budget allocated for 
these purposes by a factor of 1.5; 
  --to assign 1.3 million square meters of housing area in new 
home construction sites for the free improvement of housing 
conditions for those on waiting lists in prefectures and the 
city administration; 
  --starting 1 January 1994, to begin the conversion of city 
health services to the principles of budgetary-insurance 
medicine on the basis of the medical insurance fund established 
in 1993. At the same time, to increase expenditures on the 
maintenance of medical institutions. 
  --to develop the projected trend in reducing the gap in the 
wages of workers in public education, health services, and other 
branches of the city economy; 
  --to continue the policy on rendering financial support to 
cultural institutions and also implement a program for the 
restoration and reconstruction of the Bolshoy Theater, the State 
Fine Arts Museum, the Russian State Library, the Tretyakovskaya 
Gallery, and the Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Hill; 
  --to render every kind of support to law enforcement organs 
in the fight against crime and continue implementation of the 
program for the development of their material base and technical 
equipping; 
  --despite the significant increase in expenditures and 
reductions in budget capabilities, to continue subsidizing a 
large part of the costs of the operation of the housing fund, 
passenger transport, and municipal services. 
<H5>  IV. </H5>
  In the investment complex, provision is made to 
ensure continuation of the scope of housing construction and 
also social facilities and engineering infrastructure associated 
with it. Three million square meters of housing area, 20 
schools, 25 kindergartens, 11 polyclinics, and three hospital 
buildings will be built. 
  Work will be continued on reconstruction of the center of 
the 
city, where it is planned to erect a building with a total area 
of 1.5 million square meters, including 200,000 square meters of 
residences. 
  It is planned to continue reconstruction of the buildings of 
the Moscow Kremlin, construction of a business center on 
Stankevich Street, reconstruction of Manezhe Square and 
buildings of the Manege with the organization of an underground 
space, a multifunctional business center on Tverskaya-Yamskaya 
Street, and reconstruction of Stoleshnik Lane and zoo facilities. 
  Construction will be continued on new subway lines. 
  In the first half of the year, the Bibirevo-Altufyevskaya 
line will be put into operation, and construction of the 
Lublinskaya and Mitinskaya lines will be accelerated. 
  For the purpose of increasing the amount of telephone 
numbers 
and improving the quality of telephone communications, it is 
planned to build four ATS [automatic telephone exchange] 
buildings in the Central, Southeastern, Western, and 
Southwestern administrative districts. 
  To finance the investment program under conditions of an 
acute shortage of budgetary resources the government intends to 
expand the use of nonbudgetary sources. For these purposes there 
will be continuation of the practice of selling at investment 
auctions parts of newly built housing areas, "unfinished" sites, 
and also trade and everyday service facilities whose 
construction has been completed. 
  For the purpose of reducing the periods and lowering the 
cost 
of housing construction, competitions will be conducted between 
contracting organizations for the right to perform the work. 
  The government is actively starting to implement the 
concepts 
of the administrative districts to replace obsolete housing 
assets at the expense of investor resources, first of all 
five-story buildings. 
<H5>  V. </H5>
  The government believes that an increase in the reliability 
of the life support systems of the city is the paramount task of 
municipal services. 
  For this purpose, it is planned: 
  --to increase the volume of major housing repairs and 
complete up to 2.5 million square meters (including 0.5 at the 
expense of investor resources); 
  --to increase the volume of major and routine road repairs, 
and to complete up to 20 million square meters; 
  --to conduct repair, reorganization, and reconstruction of 
engineering networks: 
  heating system--350 kilometers 
  central heating centers--300 units 
  waterline system--89 kilometers 
  sewer system--93 kilometers 
  gas system--100 kilometers 
  streetcar lines--70 kilometers 
  --to acquire not less than 680 units of rolling stock for 
the 
system of overland passenger service. 
  In the consumer market sphere the government plans to 
support 
the ongoing system of providing incentives for delivery of basic 
food products to the city, to strengthen direct ties with 
regional producers of agricultural products, and to switch to a 
system of contracts with wholesale suppliers of foodstuffs. 
  Through its tax, credit, and investment policy, the 
government intends to promote stabilization and a reduction in 
Moscow's industrial slump. The food industry, the production of 
building materials and building structures, and the production 
of consumer goods will remain priorities. Economic incentives 
will be implemented to attract nonstate investors to these 
branches. 
  The fund for support of small business will be used to 
stimulate small business, first and foremost that which produces 
goods and services for the population. 
  It is planned to continue implementation of the city program 
"Conversion," shifting emphasis to financing the preparation of 
production of machines and instruments developed in the defense 
complex of the city of Moscow for municipal services. 
<H5>  VI. </H5>
  The government will strive in 1994 to make changes in the 
conditions of privatization of state enterprises so that 
privatization will promote an increase in the efficiency of 
production, improvement in the efficiency of services to the 
population, and attraction of additional resources for 
stabilization of the economy and the reconstruction of 
production. 
  The Government of Moscow also intends to actively use its 
right to retain for itself part of the package of shares of 
stock (including "gold" shares) of enterprises being privatized 
that are most important to the city. 
  In the sphere of lease relations and land payments, a 
complex 
of measures has been outlined to increase the profitability of 
these budget articles. 
  In the sphere of tax policy and the budget process, it is 
planned to prepare a number of legislative initiatives aimed at 
reducing taxes on profits and increasing taxes on real estate 
and resources, and also at achieving more just proportions of 
distribution of city and federal incomes and expenditures. 
  In the sphere of improving administration, it is planned to 
continue the policy for further optimization of the distribution 
of functions between city and territorial organs of 
administration for the purpose of reducing the share of 
administrative decisions on the part of the government. 
  It is planned to develop and conduct measures for the 
development of local public self-government. 
<H5>  VII. </H5>
  In adopting this program, the Government of Moscow believes 
that in the course of its implementation there must be a 
continuous search for reserves to improve city development 
indicators, first and foremost in the resolution of social tasks. 
  The Government of Moscow, realizing that successful 
implementation of the program in many ways depends on the 
formation of the income part of the city budget, calls on the 
Government of Russia to make decisions within its power on 
immediate support of the economy of Moscow through deductions 
from taxes being paid by administrative systems on the territory 
of the city and also payment in full of subventions for the 
performance of capital functions. 
  Taking into account the preparations for the celebration of 
the 850th anniversary of Moscow, a special program has been 
adopted as a supplement to the government's annual program. 
  In the interests of the prosperity of the capital of 
Russia--Moscow--and the well-being of its residents, and in the 
interests of social peace, the Government of Moscow calls on 
trade union organizations and social movements, political 
parties and blocs, entrepreneurs--everyone who holds a position 
of creativity and stability in society--to cooperate.

<F P=106> Article by Igor Arkhipov, observer of the weekly CHAS PIK, </F>
for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA: "Sobchak Has Given It to the St. 
Petersburg Soviet Via Moscow"] 
  [Text] A long-standing dream of the mayor of St. 
Petersburg has, finally, come true--the St. Petersburg Soviet 
has been dissolved. Anatoliy Sobchak now governs the city 
single-handedly. 
  In St. Petersburg, the essence of the opposition of the 
representative and executive authorities, which went as far as 
the surprise conflict of Aleksandr Belyayev and Anatoliy 
Sobchak, amounted by no means to the question of whether new 
soviet elections were necessary. The problem lay elsewhere--who 
would draw up the statutes governing the municipal authorities 
and elections. The deputies feared that were the initiative to 
pass to the mayoralty, the successor of Soviet power in 
Petersburg could be a "pocket" city duma, which would not be 
permitted to control the administration. 
  On the final day of the city soviet's existence, 22 
December, 
the deputies displayed miracles of efficiency, adopting within 
90 minutes, practically without time-outs for debate, their 
rules of the game. In accordance with these, the city was to 
have a council consisting of 124 deputies working on a 
professional basis. This figure was unexpectedly deduced by the 
Democratic Russia deputy Vasyutochkin on the basis of 
mathematical calculations, modern management theory, and world 
experience (in accordance with his system of methods, 
incidentally, the duma in Moscow should consist not of 35, but 
of almost 200 deputies). The mayoralty took this as an insult. 
In addition, the council acquired the right to appoint and 
dismiss senior functionaries of the administration and express 
no confidence in it, dismiss (following a court ruling) the 
mayor himself, even, and conduct a referendum in the city! 
  When the deputies' intentions became clear, the edict, 
signed 
by the president, "Reform of the Organs of State Power of the 
City of St. Petersburg" appeared. It was no secret that the 
author of this edict was none other than Anatoliy Sobchak. The 
mayor took account of his recent gaffe: He had at the end of 
November attempted to eliminate the Inner Council by his 
directive and was accused of having broken the law and of having 
appropriated the prerogatives of the president. This time, 
Anatoliy Aleksandrovich resolved not to ignore the chief of 
state. 
  The St. Petersburg situation is an example of how the model 
of behavior adopted by the federal executive, forcing the 
structural reorganization of the political system of the state, 
is being carried over to the regional level. The impatience with 
the statutes being prepared by the Petersburg Soviet on a reform 
of the authorities was reminiscent of the charges leveled at the 
Congress of preparation of a constitution "for itself." The 
mayor's presentation of his version of a municipal 
"constitution," on the other hand, is proving to be analogous to 
the "phased constitutional reform." 
  St. Petersburg's mayor has now for certain reasons been 
forced to show that he is no less royal than the king. In the 
course of the parliamentary elections, Sobckak involuntarily 
criticized Yeltsin and Russia's Choice, imitating the 
"constructive opposition" (Mikhail Poltoranin, who showed up in 
St. Petersburg two days prior to the elections, discovered with 
horror that "the city is headed by an opponent of the 
Constitution"!). After the defeat of the Russian Democratic 
Reform Movement, which obtained in St. Petersburg only 8.66 
percent, and after the local "Democratic Russians" ostracized 
Sobchak as a "splitter" of the democratic movement, the mayor 
had by way of moral and political rehabilitation to demonstrate 
his "decisiveness." More precisely, concern himself with 
avoiding early elections and become, essentially, "president" of 
St. Petersburg. 
  The town governor is now not only head of the executive in 
the city, but also "arbiter." "Arbiter," what is more, between 
himself (that is, the administration) and the City Assembly. The 
representative authority is generously endowed with truly sham 
functions--50 deputies working on a part-time basis, meeting 
once a week, have the right to vote on the budget proposed by 
the mayoralty and stamp the mayor's directives; a two-thirds 
vote is needed to override his "veto." The "Statute on the 
System of the Organs of State Power" proposed by Sobchak, which 
Yeltsin approved as a supplement to the edict, was drawn up with 
a manifest claim to parody. The deputies' draft, for example, 
had contained the following provision: If the Council has 
rejected the candidacy of an official, the mayoralty may not 
offer it for a second time within six months. In Sobchak's 
version, this appears as follows: Following a lack of confidence 
expressed in an official by the deputies, the mayor may retain 
him "in a personal capacity," and the City Assembly is not 
entitled to return to this matter for six months! 
  Aleksandr Belyayev, chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet 
and 
now a deputy of the Federation Council, reacted negatively to 
the recent initiatives of the executive and even promised on 
behalf of the deputies to bring an action against the president 
in the Supreme Court. Belyayev believes that a city assembly 
working on a "volunteer basis" would, most likely, be formed 
from government officials. His forecast seems more convincing to 
many people than the mayor's claims that such a reform does not 
signify a return to the soviets of the times of the CPSU but a 
resurrection of the traditions of the pre-revolution city duma, 
with class representation. 
  The position of Aleksandr Belyayev, incidentally, who has 
traditionally been inclined to leave himself room for maneuver, 
has been distinguished by a firm consistency as of late. 
Belyayev condemned many representatives of Russia's Choice for 
political extremism, warning: "If the `Choice' continues the 
policy of procedural stunts, during preparation of the work of 
the Federal Assembly included, and to fan hysteria over 
Zhirinovskiy, an effective majority against the `Choice' and the 
Liberal Democratic Party as extremes will take shape"....

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, Russian ambassador to the </F>
United States, by Denis Molchanov; place and date not given: 
"Fate Leads Those Who Agree With It, and Drags Along Those Who 
Do Not: Russia's Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin 
Appraises the Results of President Bill Clinton's Visit to 
Moscow"] 
  [Text] [Molchanov] Vladimir Petrovich, do you agree that 
for the first time in a long while a Russian-American summit did 
not result in us giving up positions in some or other area of 
national interests? 
  [Lukin] I would appraise this visit as a success. And its 
results as normal, predictable, and even inevitable. 
  Of the entire package of documents signed, I would single 
out 
first and foremost the trilateral agreement on nuclear arms in 
Ukraine. Even taking into consideration the difficult political 
situation in that country, I think that President Kravchuk's 
actions will be met with understanding on the part of both the 
Ukrainian people and its parliament. So I believe that the 
agreement will be ratified by Kiev. As a last resort, history 
knows some instances when documents signed by presidents but 
never ratified by a legislative body of that country still were 
observed (for instance, the SALT treaty proposed by Jimmy Carter 
but rejected by the U.S. Congress). 
  Another important event is the agreement on uranium. The 
American bureaucracy is one of the most talented in the world, 
and the fact that this agreement was pushed through is an 
unquestionable success of our diplomacy. In other words, the 
American market is being gradually opened for us, too. 
  Another one--the Moscow Declaration. A statement aimed at a 
mature partnership without illusions. Practically for the first 
time we are saying that we can cooperate as equals in areas of 
mutual interest. 
  [Molchanov] Does this mean that Russia finally has shed the 
demeaning image of "Mr. Yes" it has acquired over the past few 
years? 
  [Lukin] I would even say that this was a "Mrs. Yes" image. 
In 
our desire to follow other people's advice, we went too far. 
Today there is an indication of a return to the normal practice 
of international relations. Some call it the "old mentality," 
some--"new thinking..." I believe that there can only be right 
and wrong thinking. 
  The right thinking now is letting our neighbors that Russia 
is an elephant, not a yapping lapdog, and it should not be 
barked at as some do. Difficult times happen in the history of 
any country, when it suddenly finds itself at a crossroads. Our 
choice is a democratic civilized society, ready for full-fledged 
cooperation with its partners on an equal footing. Yes, we do 
have problems, but Russia is a great power, and it will resolve 
them. 
  President Clinton showed sensitivity and tact in his grasp 
of 
our problems. And this is another important result of his visit.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Kalashnikov and Marina Kalashnikova: </F>
"Russia as a Mirror of the American Revolution: Bush's Legacy 
and Clinton's Reform Ambitions"] 
  [Text] There has always been for the Russian observer 
an element of the enigmatic in the actions and fate of American 
presidents. An anxious looking back at their domestic concerns 
has arisen every now and then behind the natural and 
understandable great-power character of their foreign policy. 
Soviet propaganda with its anti-effectiveness did much to 
contribute to intra-American problems being perceived with us 
ultimately as contrived. All the more odd and implausible did it 
seem that omnipotent occupants of the White House were after 
triumphs in the world arena deprived of office on account of 
discrepancies in budget accounting and insufficient concern for 
the "needy strata" or following the discovery of a "bug" in the 
headquarters of political opponents. 
<H5>  President Learning on the Job </H5>
  In this sense Bill Clinton is a complete enigma. Barely 
having assumed office, he made his wife and himself hostage to a 
very risky broad-based reform of health care (the point at issue 
is the introduction of uniform medical insurance and general 
preventive medical examination). Major programs for upgrading 
the system of education, improving highways and communications, 
and combating crime and unemployment are in the offing. There 
will hardly be sufficient time for tangible returns from such 
designs before the next elections. On the other hand, like any 
major restructuring, they promise at the first stage higher 
taxes, the resistance of the bureaucracy, and immense and daily 
organizational problems. 
  Clinton has dealt in highly distinctive fashion with the 
groundwork in the creation of a "new world order" inherited from 
Bush. Instead of digging in on the Somalia beachhead and 
introducing "law and order" on Haiti on the basis of the 
experience of Desert Storm and the intervention in Panama in 
1989, he has in fact left these situations to their inner logic. 
The lowering of the plank of losses and risk to which the United 
States might now accede in "crisis regions" has been 
demonstrated to the world. It will be more difficult after this 
to count on the unquestioning loyalty of the allies and the 
sincere partnership of UN leaders. 
  True, a simplified version of the former global ideas geared 
to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
has recently been released. But this concept also will, most 
likely, be advanced without any particular energy in view of the 
quite exotic counteralliances (like that of Pakistan and North 
Korea) between "threshold" states which have already emerged. 
  On the whole, the geopolitical takeoff run of previous U.S. 
administrations is not today switching to ascent thrust. The 
words of Helmut Schmidt of two years ago: "Some people today 
take America to be the sole superpower. I consider this a 
delusion or, at least, an exaggeration; in a few years this 
euphoria will disappear," are being confirmed, evidently. 
  The capacity of the President and his team for maneuver and 
their readiness for the necessary tactical retreats merit 
attention under such conditions. Clinton is avoiding drastic 
steps with unpredictable consequences. This reflects both his 
recognition of the imperfection of methods that were effective 
18 months ago even and more profound factors. 
<H5>  It Is a Good Thing That There Is a Zhirinovskiy </H5>
  Inasmuch as there is more freedom, as distinct from 
democracy, in Russia than in America, radicals are the main ones 
engaged in earnest in ascertaining the potential of discontent. 
Within the framework of election and other political campaigns 
they at their expense bring to the surface the scale of 
rejection of the authorities by the populace and identify the 
real reserve of strength of the system. The simple and 
inexpensive indicator of social tension operates in good time. 
  In the United States there are costly means of ascertaining 
and suppressing the radicals themselves. For this reason the 
authorities have to rely more on the estimates of research 
services, intuition, and the criticism of respectable political 
opponents. All the more unexpected are instances where the seals 
and valves on the American social boiler fail, and one can see 
for oneself the real tension brewing within. 
  The two days of disturbances in Los Angeles, the second 
biggest city of the United States, in 1992 cost 53 lives and 
half a billion dollars' worth of physical damage. TIME Magazine, 
which is not usually given to socioeconomic determinism, 
acknowledged a year later that it was a question of 
unemployment, which in the "black" neighborhoods amounted to 50 
percent, the catastrophic shortage of funds for social needs, 
and the fact that the poverty level was in places higher than 
the indicator of 1965--the time of the previous large-scale 
unrest. Nor did TIME overlook the consequences of the drastic 
cutback in military production: this was the reason for the loss 
of over 150,000 jobs in the city. And the ethnic clashes and the 
violence, which got out of control, should be seen merely as a 
consequence of these circumstances. The gangs operating in the 
city have up to 130,000 combatants "under arms." For comparison: 
The United States intends to leave approximately as many in 
Europe to maintain the "balance of forces." 
  The events in Los Angeles were a kind of apotheosis of the 
preceding decade marked by Reaganomics, an arms buildup, the 
show and use of force, and the victorious conclusion of the cold 
war. The social results of this policy are as follows: In 1979 
some 19 percent of wage workers doing a full day's work received 
wages below the poverty criteria, at the start of the 1990's the 
proportion of these was in excess of 25 percent. Real wages 
declined constantly and the gap between the rich and poor groups 
of society grew in these same years. According to Harvard 
economist Richard Freeman, "the United States is evidently 
developing in the direction of a 'class-based society' of the 
type that exists in Latin America, with severely uneven income 
and unstable governments." 
  While drawing a distinction between social processes and 
econometric statistics, many American experts affirm that 
poverty under the present conditions could grow even with an 
increase in production. According to FORTUNE Magazine, what is 
frightening for millions of Americans is not the loss of their 
jobs themselves but "being condemned to work their whole lives 
without hope of achieving an acceptable living standard." In 
fact, it is in all this that the budget deficit and national 
debt which are being debated on Capitol Hill are manifested. In 
the figurative comparison of the well-known Russian America 
specialist V.S. Vasilyev, the national debt of the United States 
today (more than $4.5 trillion) is reminiscent of a vast 
man-made lake, which is at maximum potential being contained in 
the foundation area by a dam in the shape of the top federal 
leadership. The main component of the dam is the Bill Clinton 
administration. It is forced to constantly replenish this 
bottomless "lake," aware of the growing and almost irreversible 
threat to an economy situated in a "valley." Under these 
conditions it is excited less and less by overseas adventures or 
the ambitions of the "new democracies." 
<H3>  The Fall of the `Iron Curtain' Has Separated Russia and the 
United States Even More </H3>
  The level of geopolitical confrontation with Russia has been 
reduced, it would seem, to warnings against the suppression of 
its own democracy and half-hints at the undesirability of an 
undermining of the sovereignty of its CIS partners. For many 
people in Russia this serves as the best proof of the 
insidiousness of Washington's new policy. Some people simply 
cannot endure the absence of the former two-dimensional 
reference points: "We will not, they say, let the Poles, Czechs, 
and Hungarians into NATO, Russia must not be isolated." The 
response of the former enemy surprisingly does not contain an 
ultimatum: "Nor do we intend admitting them, particularly 
against your wishes. This is for us a secondary issue, and we 
will not cause any aggravation for the sake of it. You 
yourselves wanted to join, for that matter, as we recall?" 
  The winding down of the entire zone of military rivalry, 
where the bulk of the contacts and mutual attention between the 
United States and Russia was in fact concentrated, is 
objectively reducing the overall extent of their relations and 
the degree of urgent interest in one another. Inasmuch as 
bilateral economic, scientific, and cultural relations between 
them remain negligible, the contours of the United States on the 
horizon of the Russian world perception are being eroded, as it 
were. By virtue of the decline in the significance of the 
Russian and American military arsenals, the immense 
socioeconomic gap is now at the forefront as the measure of 
comparison: by a factor of six in terms of GNP, by a factor of 
10 in terms of inhabitants' car ownership, and so forth. All 
this is perceived and is essentially a giant barrier, which, as 
it might seem, has separated our countries forever. We are 
moving further away from one another in our national priorities. 
We should at least avoid losing an adequate understanding of the 
problems and aspirations of the other side. 
<H5>  How Might the Former Rivals Help One Another </H5>
  Russians were for a long time raised in fear of the 
well-nigh 
invulnerable transatlantic monster. Today the domestic media are 
steeped in an inordinate piety in respect to American power and 
its boundlessness. In actual fact, the emphasis on constant 
economic growth and the military rivalry have thoroughly 
undermined this power. The greatest damage has been done to the 
social sphere, where a significant charge of instability and 
conflicts has arisen. A recognition of the seriousness of the 
accumulated socioeconomic problems is prompting President 
Clinton toward a serious modernization of American policy not 
only overseas but primarily within the country. His main role at 
the present stage of the development of the United States 
consists of this attempt, possibly. 
  There are certain parallels between the domestic condition 
of 
the United States and Russia. If it is true that the less 
developed countries see the foremost countries as their future, 
it is just as true that the problems of the foremost have become 
particularly serious in the less developed countries. The 
factors of instability in Russia could be manifested in the very 
near future in the United States also. 
  The United States is not in a position to render Russia 
significant economic assistance, and Russia will hardly in the 
foreseeable future become an equal partner for America. But they 
could help one another, exchanging models and experience of the 
accomplishment of specific tasks, primarily in the sphere of an 
improvement in people's living conditions. It is obvious that an 
intensive accumulation of such experience has already begun in 
the United States under the leadership of Bill Clinton. Moscow 
would be making a big mistake were it to underestimate this 
aspect of the American President's activity. Washington's new 
policy could be an important reference point and opportunity for 
Russia, if the depth and similarity of many American and Russian 
problems are recognized.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Ostrovskiy: "Is Optimism Justified?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The man in the street is bored with 
meetings of "giants." Today a summit like the one in Moscow is 
not likely to evoke the almost hysterical excitement of 
journalists which relatively recently marked the negotiations of 
the leaders of Russia (or the USSR) and the United States. 
  Although the problems discussed are no less significant. 
Take, for example, the decision that the strategic missiles of 
Russia and America will no longer be aimed at any specific 
target. In essence this means that both powers in practice have 
rejected the possibility of launching a preventive nuclear 
strike. Can you really not call this a true breakthrough in the 
area of international security?! [passage omitted] 
  In my view, the Russian audience did not get much food for 
thought about the content of the Moscow summit. At least if one 
is to judge from the newspaper reports. The American public, on 
the contrary, as always, had no shortage of commentary from 
qualified specialists. The majority of them confidently 
anticipated the agenda, which consisted of three main points, 
including recommending economic aid to Russia, the problem of 
nuclear weapons, and expansion of NATO. The only variations were 
in the degree of attention which, in their opinion, would be 
paid to one issue or another. I decided to compare the opinion 
of American international affairs specialists with the 
viewpoints of their Russian colleagues. One of them, and a 
fairly well-informed and extremely experienced one at that, 
suggested these topics (in order of importance): discussion of 
the American vision of partnership relations with Russia, a 
comparison (and for the Kremlin also a definition) of the 
national and vitally important interests of the two countries, a 
clarification of the understanding of the role of Russia in the 
CIS, problems related to NATO, and, finally, questions of 
disarmament. 
  As we can see, the preliminary assessments of the experts 
are 
extremely similar to one another and do not differ greatly from 
the actual agenda in its generally accepted form. But still I 
will risk making a prediction which, in Russia at least, has not 
been given constant attention. When speaking about the fact that 
Bill Clinton made a visit to Moscow one should not forget that 
the Russian capital was not the only point on his route. The 
American President's tour was European and involved various 
aspects of ensuring the security of primarily the United States. 
It would seem that this is the perspective from which one should 
consider the negotiations between Yeltsin and Clinton if one 
wants to understand the logic of the behavior and approaches of 
the American President. 
  Clinton's European trip came at a fairly critical moment. 
Literally a couple of days before his departure from Washington 
they announced the completion of the work on the adjustment of 
the White House's foreign political course. After not very 
successful attempts at leadership in resolving regional 
conflicts, the American administration was to have proposed to a 
nation accustomed to world leadership an updated strategy and 
tactics for actions in the international arena. Hardly anyone 
would argue with the idea that the world has changed recently. 
The problem is to determine how the world has changed. So far 
these changes have not been detected precisely enough in the 
United States, since they have too many of all kinds of misfires 
and blunders. 
  Nonetheless Bill Clinton, like any other descendent of the 
conquerors of the Wild West, does not want to show weakness. 
Therefore he has made every effort to push through his program 
"Partnership for Peace" and stem the tide of the growing new 
antagonism between West and East, on the one hand, and, on the 
other, retain his influence in NATO, which is in need of 
reconstruction and is getting out of control. The master of the 
White House also had to respond to attacks from Republicans, who 
were accusing him of political shortsightedness with respect to 
the turns of events in Russia. The reception arranged for 
representatives of various political parties in Spaso House was 
to have confirmed the postulate that Clinton is able to learn 
from his mistakes. And the fact that Zhirinovskiy was not on the 
guest list meant that the strong America had no intention of 
concealing its sympathies when the fate of democracy was being 
decided in Russia. And then the economic aspect of the 
negotiations in the Kremlin, including in the trilateral 
agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, may 
be regarded as a kind of attempt to "buy them off." It is clear 
and quite understandable that the American government had no 
intention of sliding into the Russian economic quagmire. But, on 
the other hand, it is impossible to view the entire world from 
on high; sometimes it is necessary to descend to earth to get a 
point of reference. 
  For President Yeltsin the meeting with his colleague from 
the 
United States in his home represented a truly unique opportunity 
to demonstrate the stability of his position and loudly demand 
equal rights--if only officially--in bilateral relations and 
joint actions. This position, as certain observers have noted, 
reflects the real state of affairs much more than narcissism and 
self-glorification do. 
  Nonetheless it is still not altogether clear whether Russia 
will succeed in gaining real equal rights in partnership with 
the United States, which, at the concluding news conference, 
Boris Nikolayevich discussed with a sly expression on his face, 
apparently intending to convince those in attendance once and 
for all. 
  In spite of the assessments contained in certain 
commentaries 
to the effect that the Moscow negotiations were unproductive, 
one should avoid an extremely pessimistic or excessively 
optimistic perception of the results of the meeting of 
Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton. Judging from the number of 
agreements signed, the pessimists are right. If one were to try 
to interpret the hour's delay of the concluding news conference 
as related to the "unplanned conversation" of the leaders of 
Russia and the United States, optimism is justified. It would 
seem that the presidents could have achieved impressive results 
in Moscow. The question is one of how correctly they dispose of 
these fruits.

Conditions of the Russian Federation Government: "On the 
Commodity Structure of Exports and Imports"] 
  [Text] The Center for Economic and Business Conditions of 
the Council of Ministers--Government of the Russian Federation 
has used official reporting data from state statistics organs to 
conduct an analysis of the dynamics of the physical and cost 
indices of exports and imports of the most important commodities 
in Russia's foreign trade turnover with the states of the far 
abroad for the period January-October 1993. 
  It follows from the analysis conducted that in comparison 
with the period January-October 1992: 
  --exports, amounting to $31.4 billion, were maintained on 
the 
level of the same period of 1992, this basically due to the 
influence of extensive factors; 
  --an increase in export production was observed in: 
  --ferrous metallurgy--by $1.34 billion; 
  --timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry--by $0.37 
billion; 
  --fresh and frozen fish--by $0.2 billion; 
  --a reduction took place at the same time in the export 
production of: 
  --the fuel and energy complex--by $0.7 billion; 
  --uncut diamonds--by $0.66 billion; 
  --machine building--by $0.47 billion; 
  --chemicals and petrochemicals--by $0.16 billion; 
  --nonferrous metallurgy--by $0.16 billion; 
  --imports, amounting to $15.5 billion, decreased by almost 
46 
percent, 3 percent more than for January-September 1993; 
  --in absolute terms, the reduction in imports came to $13.2 
billion; 
  --proportion of the total reduction in imports attributable 
to specific commodity groups: 
  --machinery and equipment--45.4 percent; 
  --foodstuffs--28.1 percent; 
  --nonfood consumer products--10.2 percent; 
  --medicines--5.1 percent; 
  --other products--11.2 percent. 
<H6>  EXPORTS </H6>
<H5>  Production in the Fuel and Energy Complex </H5>
  A weak but steady trend toward diminished percentages of 
commodities representing fuel and energy production output was 
observed in 1993. Thus, in January-August of 1993, this index 
amounted to 53.2 percent; in January-September it was 52.7 
percent; and in January-October it was 52 percent, approximately 
2 percent lower than the levels seen for the same period of 1992. 
  Aggregate deliveries of fuel and energy complex output in 
physical terms (taking into account gas converted to standard 
tonnes) increased by 23 percent in January-October 1993 as 
compared with the same period of 1992, at the same time that 
hard currency proceeds decreased by 4.1 percent. The total 
reduction in export production output in the fuel and energy 
complex from the level of January-October 1992 amounted to $695 
million. 
  Oil shipments in January-October 1993 increased 30 percent 
over the level of the same period of 1992. The contract price 
for oil over this period was established at the level of $105.10 
per tonne, 18.9 percent lower than the January-October 1992 
price. The rate of decrease of contract prices for oil in 1993 
correspond to the price decrease rates on the world market. In 
spite of the increased volumes of oil shipments due to the drop 
in contract prices, hard currency proceeds increased by just 5.8 
percent. 
  The rate of increase in deliveries of oil products (in 
physical terms) continues to grow. In January-August 1993, as 
compared with the same period of 1992, this rate comprised 36.8 
percent, in January-September it was 40.7 percent, and in 
January-October--45.2 percent. While the average weighted 
contract price in January-October 1993 amounted to just $95.70 
per tonne, having decreased by 42.4 percent from the level of 
the same period in 1992. As compared with the contract price 
level for January-September 1993, the January-October price was 
reduced by another $7.50. 
  In this manner, the average weighted cost of a tonne of oil 
products in 1993 was almost $10 lower than the cost of a tonne 
of crude oil. The price ratio for these products in 1992 was 
contradictory in nature: In January-October, the price of a 
tonne of oil was fixed at the level of $129, while the price of 
a tonne of oil products came to $166.30. The emergence in 1993 
of the situation outlined here is related primarily to a 
significant change in the structure of oil product shipments due 
to increased exports of the less expensive products in this 
group, in particular--fuel oil. 
  This process is showing a trend toward more active 
development in 1993. 


Changes in the Coefficient Indicating Ratio of the Average Weighted Price of 
One Tonne of Oil Products to the Price of Oil 

Year    January-March    January-June    January-September    January-October 

1992    1.22             1.26            1.29                 1.29 

1993    1.14             1.04            0.96                 0.91 


  In January-October 1993, shipments of natural gas increased 
over the January-October 1992 level by 2.7 percent. However, 
hard currency proceeds over this period decreased by $411 
million (6.7 percent). This can be explained by the average drop 
of 9 percent over this period in the contract price. 
  The physical volume of coal shipments in January-October 
1993 
increased by 11.6 percent over the same period of last year. The 
rate of increase of the export of coal is gradually 
diminishing--in January-August 1993 this was 19.6 percent; in 
January-September it was 14.2 percent. 
<H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy Output </H5>
  In January-October 1993, the share of total production 
output 
export volume attributable to ferrous metallurgy was 8.8 
percent, as opposed to 4.5 percent in January-October of 1992. 
  The main increase in hard currency proceeds from the export 
of commodities representative of this sector is directly 
attributable to the ferrous metals group (rolled metal, steel), 
which provided for 98 percent, or $1.3 billion, of the increase 
in sector exports. In cost terms, the export of rolled metals 
and steels in January-October 1993 increased by a factor of 2.3 
over the January-October 1992 level, amounting to $2.3 billion. 
  The rate of growth of cast iron exports in physical terms 
over January-October 1993 was 29 percent greater than the 
January-October 1992 level, while the contract price over this 
period decreased by 27 percent. As a result, hard currency 
proceeds were reduced by $10.4 million. 
  The rate of reduction of hard currency proceeds from the 
export of ores and concentrates--amounting in January-October 
1993 to a 16 percent drop from the level of January-October 
1992--is slightly outpacing the rate of reduction of their 
shipment volumes--13.2 percent. 
<H5>  Nonferrous Metallurgy Production Output </H5>
  The share of nonferrous metallurgy output commodities 
(aluminum, nickel, copper) of the total export volume in 
January-October 1993 amounted to 4.8 percent, or $1.5 billion, 
as opposed to 5.3 percent in January-October of 1992. The same 
indices for January-September 1993 were at the level of 3.2 
percent, or $0.9 billion. The significant increase in export 
volumes for October 1993 (of $0.6 billion) is related primarily 
to insufficiently exhaustive statistical information for the 
previous months, especially with respect to the export of copper 
and nickel. 
  The share of nonferrous metals exported in January-October 
1993 attributable to aluminum increased to 63.5 percent, as 
opposed to 56.4 percent in January-October of 1992. 
  In physical terms, the volume of aluminum exported increased 
by 50.6 percent. However, the growth of hard currency proceeds 
from the export of aluminum in January-October 1993 was just 2 
percent greater than the January-October 1992 level--caused by 
the sharp drop (32.4 percent) in average contract price. 
Preliminary estimates indicate that aluminum exports amounted to 
about 172,000 tonnes in October, while more precise data for 
September show a level for that month of 125,000 tonnes.

                                                              January-September

  In January-October 1993, the export of nickel in physical 
volume terms decreased by 27.5 percent from the January-October 
1992 level, while the contract price dropped by 10.4 percent. 
  The export of copper in physical terms in January-October 
1993 was reduced 12.6 percent from the January-October 1992 
level, while the contract price increased by 19.2 percent. 
<H5>  Uncut Diamonds </H5>
  The share of total export volume attributable to uncut 
diamonds in January-October 1993 dropped to 1.5 percent, as 
opposed to 3.6 percent in January-October of 1992. This is the 
result of a 59 percent reduction in shipment volumes and a 27 
percent reduction in contract prices. 
<H5>  Chemical and Petrochemical Production Output </H5>
  The share of total export volume attributable to chemicals 
and petrochemicals in January-October 1993 amounted to 3.3 
percent, as opposed to 3.8 percent in January-October of 1992. 
  The structure of export of representative commodities of 
this 
sector in January-October 1993 changed somewhat compared to the 
same period of 1992: 
  --the proportion of fertilizers of all varieties decreased 
from 75 to 66 percent; 
  --the share of ammonia exports increased from 12 to 18 
percent; 
  --the share of synthetic rubber exports increased from 8 to 
10 percent. 
  The aggregate export in physical volume of fertilizers of 
all 
varieties decreased by 16.2 percent in January-October 1993, as 
compared with the same period of 1992, while hard currency 
proceeds decreased by 23.2 percent. 
  Significant changes are being observed in the export 
structure for fertilizers. The export in physical terms of 
nitrogen and potash fertilizers decreased by 37.1 and 30.4 
percent, respectively, while the export of compound and 
phosphoric fertilizers increased by 98.6 and 10.7 percent. 
Contract prices dropped from 1992 levels for all varieties of 
fertilizers, except nitrogen fertilizers. 
<H5>  Timber, Woodworking, and Pulp and Paper Production </H5>
  The rate of increase (in physical terms) of shipments of 
sector commodities under observation in January-October 1993 
slowed down somewhat as compared with January-September of 1993, 
amounting to: 
  --52.3 percent for unprocessed timber shipments, as opposed 
to 73.2 percent; 
  --43.5 percent for plywood shipments, as opposed to 103.1 
percent; 
  --113.7 percent for pulp shipments, as opposed to 137.6 
percent. 
  The trend toward increased deliveries which was 
characteristic of previous months continued only with respect to 
newsprint--240.4 percent, as opposed to 219.9 percent. 
  In addition, the gap between 1993 and 1992 contract prices 
narrowed somewhat, as 1993 contract prices tended to converge 
gradually upon the 1992 level. Thus, whereas in 
January-September of 1993 prices for unprocessed timber amounted 
to 81 percent of the level for the same period of 1992, this 
ratio for the January-October period came to 98 percent. With 
respect to plywood, the figures were 57 and 65 percent, 
respectively, and for pulp--60 and 64 percent, respectively. 
<H5>  Machine-Building Output </H5>
  The share of total export production volume attributable to 
machine building in January-October 1993 decreased by 7.3 
percent, as compared to 8.7 percent for the same period of last 
year. 
  Recent months show a continued augmentation of the drop in 
machinery and equipment shipments as compared with last year. In 
January-October 1993, the decrease reached the level of $473 
million, as opposed to $394 million in January-September. At the 
same time that export volumes of civil-sector machine building 
have been decreasing in 1993, certain changes in its commodity 
structure are also being observed. However, means of ground 
transportation (excluding railroad transport) continue to occupy 
the leading position--with 47.7 percent of the total export 
volume of this sector, along with technological equipment 
(excluding electrical equipment)--38.8 percent. In this regard, 
the share of total shipments attributable to these equipment 
varieties increased by 1.5 and 4.2 percent, respectively, as 
compared with 1992 levels. It is significant that the share of 
export of aircraft decreased by 2.2 percent. 
  The only product group in the machine-building sector that 
showed a slight increase in the share of production over the 
period in question was shipbuilding. In addition, hard currency 
proceeds increased by $4.5 million as compared with 
January-October 1992. 
  For the remaining production groups in the machine-building 
sector, a drop in share was observed, ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 
percent. These include optical instruments and devices, 
electrical machinery and equipment, railroad equipment and 
rolling stock. 
  In assessing the influence of various types of production 
output on diminished export volumes in the sector, we note that 
$185.8 million (39.2 percent) of the reduction took place due to 
reduced exports of means of ground transportation, $102 million 
(21.5 percent)--due to aircraft, and $69.3 million (14.6 
percent)--to technological equipment and machinery (excluding 
electrical). The share of reduction in hard currency proceeds 
with respect to the remaining varieties of machine-building 
output fluctuates within the 6-10 percent range. 
<H5>  Fish and Fish Products </H5>
  The share of shipments of fish and fish products in 
January-October 1993 came to 1.7 percent, as opposed to 1.1 
percent for the same period of last year. 
  The shipment increase in physical volume terms amounted to 
33.1 percent. The total increase in hard currency proceeds over 
this period reached $197 million, contributing factors here 
including a growth in contract prices--amounting to 57.6 percent 
in January-October 1993. 
<H6>  IMPORTS </H6>
<H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy Production Output </H5>
  The share of imported representative products of the ferrous 
metallurgy sector increased significantly in January-October 
1993, amounting to 3.5 percent, as opposed to 2.0 percent in 
January-October of 1992. 
  Despite the overall decrease of 45.9 percent in import 
purchases in general seen in January-October 1993 as compared 
with the same period of 1992, import volumes of ferrous 
metallurgy production remained virtually at last year's level. 
Purchases of production output in this sector amounted to $541 
million, as opposed to $560 million in January-October of 1992. 
The reduction in expenditures for imports came to just $19.3 
million. 
  It must be noted that the structure of imported production 
in 
this sector also changed in January-October 1993 as compared 
with the same period of 1992. Thus, the percentage of sector 
import volume attributable to pipe increased from 54.3 to 76.3 
percent, while the share attributable to ferrous metal imports 
(rolled metal, steel), on the contrary, decreased, amounting to 
23.7 percent as opposed to 45.7 percent in January-October 1992. 
<H5>  Machine-Building Production </H5>
  The import of machinery, equipment, and means of 
transportation in January-October 1993 was virtually halved, 
amounting to $5.2 billion as opposed to $11.2 billion in 
January-October of 1992. 
  The rate of decrease in the import of machine-building 
production is rising. Thus, in January-October 1993 
machine-building output amounted to 53.2 percent of import 
production--4 percent lower than was the case for 
January-September 1993. 
  We note that the share of rolling stock purchases was 
reduced 
from 8.3 to 5.1 percent, and of electrical machinery and 
equipment--from 20.1 to 14.8 percent, while the share of 
purchases of all types of ships increased from 1.2 percent to 
5.4 percent, and that of ground transportation means--from 11.9 
to 13.3 percent. 
<H5>  Foodstuffs </H5>
  Food product purchases continue to diminish. Their share of 
the total volume of imports decreased from 21.5 percent in 
January-October 1992 to 15.8 percent in January-October 1993. In 
cost terms, food product purchases were reduced from $6.2 
billion to $2.5 billion. The rate of decline of food 
purchases--reaching 60 percent--is significantly outpacing the 
rate of decline of imports on the whole (45.9 percent). 
  Food products totaling just $110.7 million were purchased in 
October--this comprises just 5 percent of the import volume 
increase for October 1993.

  It is evident that the change in state policy in the sphere 
of centralized import purchases has exerted a significant 
influence on the dynamics of the structural indices of food 
product imports. 
<H5>  Medicines </H5>
  The share of import purchases attributable to nonfood 
consumer products in January-October 1993 amounted to about 7.6 
percent, as opposed to 8.8 percent for January-October 1992. 
  The rate of decline in the import of a number of commodity 
groups is significantly outpacing the overall rate of decline of 
imports (45.9 percent), constituting: 
  --79.6 percent, for synthetic fabrics; 
  --74.2 percent, for footwear; 
  --70.3 percent, for cotton fabrics; 
  --62.4 percent, for leather clothing; 
  --59.8 percent, for knitted articles.

  Insofar as these commodities are being imported mainly 
through the funds of commercial structures and enterprises, the 
factor of effective demand exerts a decisive influence on 
changes in their structure.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX-SEGODNYA report: "Russia: Foreign Trade in </F>
1993--Oil Exports Increased by 20 Percent"] 
  [Text] In 1993, Russia's foreign trade turnover, taking 
into account approximate estimates of exports and imports by 
private parties, amounted to $76.2 billion (U.S.) and increased 
by 0.3 percent in current prices as compared to 1992. 
  Exports amounted to $45.9 billion and increased by 13 
percent, while imports fell off by 15 percent--to $30.3 billion. 
  Russia's main trading partners were industrially developed 
countries, which in 1993 accounted for 59 percent of total 
Russian exports--$27.2 billion, which is 14 percent more than in 
1992. Exports to Germany amounted to $5.9 billion (100 percent 
as compared to 1992), Italy--$3.2 billion (107 percent), Great 
Britain--$2.2 billion (97 percent), United States--$2.1 billion 
(297 percent), and Japan--$2.0 billion (125 percent). 
  Exports to developing countries amounted to $6.4 billion and 
increased by 54 percent. Exports to other countries (former CEMA 
countries, the republics of former Yugoslavia, China, the DPRK, 
and the Baltic countries) amounted to $12.3 billion (a 3 percent 
decline); only exports to China increased to $3.3 billion (by 20 
percent). 
  In 1993, Russia exported 21 percent more oil than in 1992 
(18.2 percent of the total volume of exports), 3 percent more 
natural gas (15.1 percent), and 36 percent more petroleum 
products (7.5 percent). Export of machinery and equipment 
dropped off by almost a factor of four (6.1 percent of the total 
volume). 
  In 1993, Russia imported $30.3 billion worth of products, 
which is 15 percent less in current prices than in 1992. 
  The total value of goods imported from industrially 
developed 
countries in 1993 was $18.5 billion, or 18 percent less than 
1992, including from Germany--$6.9 billion (a 2 percent 
increase); from the United States--$2.2 billion (a 16 percent 
decrease); from Japan--$1.8 billion (a 5 percent increase); from 
Italy--$1.4 billion (a 54 percent decrease); and from 
France--$1.2 billion (a 7 percent decrease). 
  Imports from developing countries increased by 22 percent to 
$5.5 billion, and those from other countries declined by 23 
percent to $6.3 billion. China was an exception: Imports of 
Chinese-produced goods increased by 55 percent to $2.6 billion. 
Imports from Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech 
Republic, and the republics of the former Yugoslavia fell off by 
a factor of two or more. 
  Grain imports fell to a record low for the past few 
years--11 
million tonnes (5.2 percent of the total volume); purchases of 
machinery and equipment dropped off almost by half (21.7 
percent). Clothing comprised 3.2 percent of all imports, and 
sugar--2.7 percent. 
  Foreign trade balance was positive in 1993 and amounted to 
$15.6 billion (in 1992 it was also positive and amounted to $5.3 
billion). 
  Russia's total trade turnover with the republics of the 
former USSR amounted to 22.5 trillion rubles [R]. The positive 
balance in Russia's trade with CIS partners amounted to R5.249 
trillion (in current prices). The greatest disbalance has 
developed in trade with Ukraine--R3.7 trillion, Kazakhstan--R972 
billion, and Belarus--R239 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korotkova and Leonid Zavarskiy: "The </F>
State Regulates Private Imports: A Customs Committee 
Instruction"] 
  [Text] The much-discussed Government Decree No. 1322 
of 23 December, which establishes the rules for import and 
export of goods by private parties, has been taken one step 
further. The Russian State Customs Committee [GTK] issued an 
Instruction No. 553 "On Temporary Urgent Measures Regarding 
Implementation of the Government Decree." And although a 
concrete mechanism of its implementation is still under 
development, according to this customs document, new rules for 
moving goods and means of transportation by individuals, in the 
part of value quotas and amount of duties, were introduced on 1 
January. As we were told in the Customs Committee, the new rules 
so far do not extend to those who left for abroad before 31 
December. Nevertheless, it is expected that the new rules will 
begin to apply to their full extent in February, and therefore 
we believe that it would be useful to learn about its basic 
provisions and to prepare for possible consequences of the 
upcoming innovations. 
  First of all, while reducing the value quota of duty-free 
importation of goods by private parties from $5,000 to $2,000, 
the government set a single rate of custom duties for 
individuals in an amount equal to 60 percent of the customs 
value of imported goods. Duties at this rate will be applied 
only to amounts exceeding $2,000. This measure undoubtedly is 
aimed first and foremost against "shuttle" business and is quite 
justified from the standpoint of replenishing the state budget, 
since the main flow of goods comes into the Russian market 
precisely through these uncontrolled private imports. 
Nevertheless, people who have nothing to do with commercial 
imports may fall under this "shuttle" category, while customs 
officials get another source of income. The point is that a 
customs official is a person vested with the power to determine 
for what purpose an item is being brought in and to agree with 
the declared customs value--which, as is known, in a number of 
instances may differ considerably from base prices used by the 
customs (catalog prices of leading Western companies). 
  The greatest troubles are in store for foreign car lovers. 
In 
order to bring in a new car duty-free, one now has to have spent 
at least six months abroad. However, if the engine displacement 
volume is greater than 1,800 cubic centimeters, there is a 
mandatory duty of 5 ECU per 1 cubic centimeter of engine 
displacement value. Also, an automobile is considered new if it 
is less than one year old or has a mileage of less than 20,000 
km. As Vladimir Chuvayev, chief of the GTK's nontrade turnover 
customs control department, explained to KOMMERSANT, when cars 
with lesser displacement value are brought in, the terms of 
import depend only on the length of the individual's 
uninterrupted stay abroad. According to the GTK's official 
version, the new customs barrier will facilitate combating 
illegal and semilegal import of foreign cars, since in the past 
"gray" importers paid a considerably smaller customs duty than 
official dealers of foreign companies. Now this difference will 
disappear. KOMMERSANT experts believe, however, that new duties 
are a strictly fiscal measure. As to foreign car dealerships' 
retail prices, in their opinion, for automobiles with more than 
a 2-liter engine alone it will almost double. Another blow will 
be dealt to sales of foreign cars.

Federation the corresponding agreements limiting exports of 
Russian commodities.

enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership whose 
unfair trade practices, as established by an investigation 
conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the

of the Russian Federation, have led or could in the future lead 
to the adoption by other countries or integration groupings of 
antidumping and other restrictive measures in respect to Russian 
exports. 
  That the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the 
Russian Federation shall in conjunction with the Ministry of 
Economics of the Russian Federation and other interested 
ministries and departments present within a three-month period 
proposals concerning the procedure of the corresponding 
investigation.

Russian Federation shall, in the event of the adoption of 
commitments to limit exports in accordance with the agreements 
specified in clause 1 of this decree, issue in the established 
procedure export licenses such as to ensure that supplies for 
state needs be realized as a priority. 
  4. That the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the 
Russian Federation shall in conjunction with the interested 
ministries and departments adopt measures for fulfillment of the 
Russian Side's obligations ensuing from the agreements limiting 
Russian commodity exports specified by this decree.

department chief at the All-Russia Institute for Market Trends 
Research of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations: 
"The Year 1994: Basic Directions in the Formation of Foreign 
Trade Policy"] 
  [Text] The Russian system of state regulation of 
foreign economic activities has undergone a difficult two-year 
period of formation. On the whole, developments moved in the 
direction of strengthening economic methods of regulating one of 
the most important spheres of the national economy, albeit not 
always consistently. In the second half and toward the end of 
last year the first normative documents were adopted, on the 
basis of which the basic provisions of national foreign trade 
policy for 1994 were formulated. We will see how optimal and 
well-considered the combination of economic and administrative 
methods of control on the part of the state over the activities 
of Russian importers and exporters in foreign markets is over 
the current year. 
  At the editors' request, our regular author, Candidate 
of Economic Sciences V.A. Oreshkin, department chief at the 
All-Russia Institute for Market Trends Research of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, reflects on this 
subject. 
  The basic document that defines the main directions of 
nontariff regulation of exports from Russia in the current year 
is the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation 
Decree No. 1102, issued on 2 November 1993. Like last year, this 
system envisages first and foremost quota restrictions and 
licensing of exports of certain categories of products and a 
special policy regarding exports of strategically important raw 
materials (SIRM). 
  In 1993 the licensing policy set by Government Decree No. 
854, dated 6 November, was on the whole relaxed: Ammonia, 
synthetic rubber, phosphate fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, 
methanol, calcium phosphates, and some varieties of timber and 
sawn lumber were removed from the list of goods to which quotas 
applied and which constituted the bulk of Russian exports--fuel 
and electric power and raw materials, although later this list 
was expanded by adding grain and the products of its processing, 
oil-yielding crops, ethyl alcohol made from edible raw material, 
meat and milk products, casein, and wax. Beginning 1 January 
1994, in keeping with Decree No. 1102, the list of goods that 
require export licenses within established quotas included 12 
items: fuel and electric power, hydrocarbon raw materials, 
certain categories of nonferrous metals and raw materials for 
their production, cellulose, wheat, soy and sunflower seed, 
nondenatured ethyl alcohol, fish, crustaceans, and caviar. 
Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation Decree 
No. 2213-r, dated 10 December 1993, added to this list 
coniferous varieties of commercial timber and wood ties for 
mainline railroads. 
  First put into effect on 1 July 1992, the original SIRM list 
included 13 commodities; in September it was expanded to 15, and 
after 1 April 1993 it was modified to include fish and fish and 
marine products, while certain varieties of timber and paper 
products, sodium, and household items made from aluminum were 
dropped from it. Thus, the SIRM list became virtually identical 
to the list of commodities subject to quotas, with the exception 
of rolled ferrous metals, exports of which were unrestricted. 
This identification generally remains effective for 1994, 
although the SIRM list defined by aforementioned documents Nos. 
1102 and 2213-r is somewhat broader than the list of commodities 
subject to quotas due to the inclusion of some varieties of 
nonferrous, alkaline, alkaline-earth, and rare metals and 
materials for their production, fertilizer, raw diamonds, and 
sawn coniferous varieties of lumber. 
  Government Decree No. 1103, dated 30 October 1993, made 
effective as of 1 November new export duty rates for goods 
exported from the territory of Russia, and GTK [State Customs 
Committee] of Russia Directive No. 479, dated 11 November 1993, 
set the procedures for their calculation and collection. 
  In 1992-1993 export duties applied to about three-quarters 
of 
Russian exports. Exports of fuel and raw materials, foodstuffs, 
and industrial semifinished products were subject to duty. Of 
finished industrial goods, tariff regulation applied to exports 
of aviation equipment and arms. New export tariffs differ from 
those previously in effect first and foremost in the following 
respect: 
  --the list of goods subject to export duties has been cut 
almost by half (to 29 items) due to the exclusion of animal 
husbandry products and the products of their processing, certain 
varieties of food-processing output, alcohol, paper and 
cardboard, printed material, and textile raw materials and 
semifinished products; 
  --duties vary by item and range from 2 to 64,000 ECU per 
tonne of exported commodity (in the past the maximum rate was as 
high as 80,000 ECU); ad valore custom rates--from 3 to 25 
percent (5 to 70 percent, respectively). The most noticeable 
reduction in duties occurred with respect to agricultural 
products and foodstuffs, to which high export rates were applied 
in the past at a "proscriptive" level in order to limit exports, 
since exports of such products from Russia in 1993 were to a 
considerable extent made possible by state subsidies, which 
later dropped off sharply. There has been a perceptible 
reduction in duties with respect to certain varieties of 
nonferrous metals and raw materials for their production. 
According to Decree No. 1102, exports of goods for state needs 
and exports of commodities from Russia to CIS countries on a 
clearing or interrelated basis are exempt from export duties in 
1994, as they were in 1993. 
  Policy in the area of tariff regulation of exports in 1994 
will be formed taking into consideration the same factors as the 
policy in the area of administrative regulation. Exports of a 
number of raw materials that previously fell under the 
government's administrative and economic control currently no 
longer have to be restricted, either directly or indirectly: 
Domestic prices for them have reached the world level or even 
exceeded it, which leads to practically identical results 
regardless of whether these goods are sold on the domestic or 
foreign market. I want to remind you that in keeping with the 
Law "On Customs Tariffs" quantitative restrictions on exports 
and tariff regulation expire on 31 December 1995. 
  Liberalization of foreign trade policy with respect to 
Russian exporters in 1994 does not mean that the state forfeits 
control over their "civilized" conduct in carrying out 
deliveries of products to the foreign market. Strengthening of 
this control will be aimed first and foremost at the timely 
repatriation of foreign currency earnings to Russia. On 12 
October 1993 the Central Bank and the GTK of Russia issued Joint 
Instruction No. 19 and 01-20/10283, which sets the procedure for 
hard currency control over repatriation to the Russian 
Federation of foreign currency earnings from exports of goods. 
For SIRM exports it goes into effect on 1 January 1994, for all 
other goods--on 1 March 1994. 
  As is known, over the past two years similar documents had 
been adopted at different levels of legislative and executive 
authority on numerous occasions. The aforementioned instruction 
is probably the first appreciable step on the road to creating a 
real working mechanism of control over repatriation of foreign 
currency proceeds by exporter enterprises. The control structure 
is quite complex, since it must tie into a single chain all the 
Russian components of an export deal: "exporter--customs--bank." 
In keeping with the instruction, control documentation has been 
introduced allowing the passage of goods over the border to be 
traced, and foreign currency proceeds to then be repatriated. In 
these circumstances the role of authorized banks increases 
dramatically, since now they will in fact perform the functions 
of foreign currency control agents, especially when possible 
sanctions and penalties envisaged by the instruction are applied. 
  Another direction of strengthening export control on the 
part 
of the state is necessitated by factors of an "external" nature. 
On 2 December 1993 Government Decree No. 1248 was issued "On 
Measures of Settling Trade Disputes Arising in Connection With 
Exports of Russian Goods." In keeping with this, the government 
will implement control over the activities of exporting 
enterprises whose dishonest trade practices lead or may lead to 
importing countries imposing antidumping or other restrictive 
measures with respect to Russian goods. Such control will be 
exercised in the form of establishing additional quotas for 
exports of commodities with respect to which importer countries 
introduce restrictions; requiring their licensing; setting 
minimum export prices; and limiting the actual number of 
exporters. The MFER [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] has 
the right to revoke the export licenses of Russian 
exporters--regardless of form of ownership--that are identified 
as "violators." 
  Russian exporters should be aware of the preferences they 
may 
be eligible to claim in exporting goods to the countries of the 
European Community [EC], which unites 12 states in Western 
Europe. The point is that the General System of Preferences of 
the European Communities (GSP EC) has been in effect since 1971, 
which envisages customs and tariff preferences in importing into 
EC countries goods from a state to which the preferential 
(favored) treatment is extended. 
  In order for a commodity exported from Russia into EC 
countries to qualify for this preferential treatment, the 
Russian exporter has to present in these countries a Form "A" 
certificate of the origin of goods issued by MFER authorized 
representatives in the regions in keeping with departmental 
instruction No. 452 dated 24 June 1993 "On Procedure of Issuing 
Certificates of the Origin of Goods for Selling Within the 
General System of Preferences of the European Community (GSP 
EC)." Otherwise, "nonpreferential" rates of European Community 
customs duties will be applied to imports. 
  The system of regulating imports in 1994 includes the same 
instruments as last year--procedures for determining the customs 
value of imported goods and control over their safety, 
procedures for establishing the country of origin, tariff and 
tax regulation of imports, etc. 
  However, in keeping with Government Decree No. 985 dated 30 
September 1993 and GTK of Russia Instruction No. 445 dated 1 
November 1993, on 11 October 1993 new rates of excise taxes on 
imported goods went into effect, which are higher compared to 
those in the past. Then excise tax rates were once again 
modified in keeping with Government Decree No. 1185 dated 19 
November 1993 and made effective by GTK of Russia Instruction 
No. 501 dated 26 November 1993. Currently excise tax rates in 
effect range from 10 to 250 percent of the customs value of 
imported goods. 
  Letter No. 01-13/11649 of the GTK of Russia dated 22 
November 
1993 establishes the procedure for importing goods by physical 
persons. The main provision of the document is to set general 
provisions for regulation of imports of goods, including payment 
of duties, value-added tax, excise tax, customs fees, and so on, 
for both legal and physical persons if these goods are imported 
with the intention of their subsequent use for production or 
commercial purposes. 
  The tightening or liberalization of import policy in the 
future will depend to a large extent on new import tariff rates, 
which are now at the stage of approval. 
  In the current year work will continue on the formation of a 
normative base which will define the contents of customs 
regulations set by the Customs Code, and the finalization of 
trade regulations governing trade with all countries that are 
former USSR republics. 
  The MFER has completed work on analyzing the reports of 
enterprises, sectors, and regions in utilizing the means 
received as a result of preferences granted in 1992-1993 in 
their conduct of foreign economic activities. In the future the 
ministry, which has always advocated an integrated system of 
state regulation of foreign economic activities, will strengthen 
record-keeping and control over the receipt and targeted use of 
such means.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Vasin: "Steps Toward the Throne. Kim </F>
Il-song: Who Is He?" Names in parentheses as transliterated] 
  [Text] The "Great Leader" of the Korean people was created 
and cultivated and exists not in accordance with the wishes of 
the people of North Korea, but in accordance with a design of 
the CPSU Central Committee Politburo planned in advance and of 
the leader of all the peoples personally. 
  A whole system of authorities formed north of the 38th 
parallel was involved in his formation, elevation, and 
confirmation in the role of military commander, theorist, and 
leader. Here is a rough sketch of these authorities: Colonel 
General Shtykov, the direct representative of the Central 
Committee Politburo responsible for the entire situation on the 
ground and former secretary of the CPSU Leningrad Oblast 
Committee; the 25th Army's Military Council, Major General 
Lebedev; the 25th Army's Special Propaganda Section, Major 
Kovyzhenko, chief, who subsequently came to be called senior 
official of the CPSU Central Committee; the newspaper CHOSON 
SINMUM; and Pyongyang Radio, whose programs were produced by 
representatives of our country. The University of Pyongyang, 
which was formed in accordance with a decision of the CPSU 
Central Committee, and its provost, Pak Il, a Soviet scholar. It 
was he who taught Kim Il-song the rudiments of Marxist-Leninist 
science. The Soviet military administration--Major General 
Romanov and Colonel Ignatov, his deputy for political affairs. 
And, of course, the KGB (Army counterintelligence), headed by 
Major General Anokhin. 
  Your author was working in the Army's Special Propaganda 
Section as assistant section chief. According to the listed 
establishment, this section was in wartime to work among the 
troops and the populace of the enemy. 
  The branch had 14-15 officers of Korean extraction. We 
created Kim Il-song from scratch, virtually, and performed this 
work "crudely and visibly," without embarrassment or pangs of 
conscience--as the party ordered. I more than others, possibly, 
dealt with Kim Il-song on a daily and weekly basis in the first 
five or six months. Then, as Terentiy Fomich Shtykov's staff 
grew, the section's role was scaled back. Nonetheless, the work 
that enabled Kim to become not only a military commander but 
also a leader was performed in the first two years. 
<H5>  The Situation From 18 Through 23 August 1945 </H5>
  The decree of the Japanese emperor on capitulation was 
announced in the morning of 15 August. Units of our 25th Army 
were pushing forward through Manchuria in the direction of the 
Korean borders. In the night of 16 August they entered Yanji, 
where the headquarters of the Japanese 5th Army were located. On 
17 August the commander of our 25th Army, Colonel General 
Chistyakov, the celebrated hero of the battle of Stalingrad, 
accepted the surrender of the Japanese from Major General 
Hachiro Iketani, chief of staff of the Army. The Japanese 
general reported that Japan had observed all the terms of the 
surrender and that only one subunit was, in view of its 
isolation from headquarters, putting up resistance to our 
advance, for which General Iketani apologized. 
  The higher command ordered General Chistyakov personally to 
deplane at Pyongyang. Immediately! He ordered that the trains be 
loaded up and that they make full-speed for Pyongyang. Others 
followed at their own pace. 
  I know that there were no national formations in our Army's 
units. And had there been, we would have been well aware of it. 
Our section was required to look after such subunits and rely on 
them in its work. There was no detachment of Kim Il-song or the 
Chinese Wang Song on the Korean salient. This "presence" of 
national subunits was designed subsequently as camouflage for 
the future leader. 
  Chistyakov's aircraft touched down at Pyongyang Airport. 
Accompanying the general was a group of submachinegunners, a 
radio operator, and a signals officer. Koreans and Japanese were 
awaiting the appearance of the Soviet forces. Several cars were 
made available to Ivan Mikhaylovich, who set off directly for 
the residence of Shoji Furukawa, governor of the northern 
provinces. But this building had at four in the afternoon been 
taken over by a people's committee, which had arisen 
spontaneously. But the official acceptance of the surrender took 
place here, in the former office of the Japanese general. 
  Colonel General Chistyakov as yet knew nothing of Kim 
Il-song. He and many others had simply not been notified, and he 
acted as prudence dictated. Moscow had not yet chosen the person 
whom it would back. 
  Cho Man-sik? A leader of the national liberation movement of 
1919. He had together with Syngman Rhee led the 1 March 
uprising. The difference between them was that Cho Man-sik had 
spent from 1919 through 1945 in jail. Syngman Rhee, on the other 
hand, had been in exile. Cho Man-sik was released from prison in 
accordance with the emperor's capitulation decree, and Syngman 
Rhee arrived in South Korea on 17 August from Hong Kong. 
  Representatives of the people's committees had since 21 
August been coming to our command headquarters, and from there 
they were sent to us, to our Special Propaganda Section. People 
came in a stream to express gratitude for the liberation, to 
register, to present a complaint, to communicate something or 
other of importance, and so forth. 
  Such people in our section were former members of the 
All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) who had been infiltrated 
into Korea in the 1930's by a decision of the Communist 
International Executive Committee and the Profintern. On 15 
August they also had been released from prison. About 10-12 
persons were the most active. They included (Pak Den Ay) (Vera 
Tsoy. She would subsequently become vice chairman of [Yezheni 
Kotton's] International Organization of Women), her husband, 
(Kim Yem Bom), and others. It was they and their comrades who 
notified all provinces that the First Communist Party of Korea 
Congress would be held in Pyongyang on 28 August. They 
themselves on the very first day went to the former governor's 
residence and together with Cho Man-sik joined the Provisional 
People's Committee of North Korea. Cho Man-sik perfectly 
naturally occupied the post of chairman, and he was at this time 
supported by the Communists. 
  Some special propaganda officers made, as we were told 
later, 
a mistake. They visited without permission the People's 
Committee building and congratulated Cho Man-sik on the 
liberation. This was on 21 August 1945. The mistake was caused 
by the fact that we did not know Moscow's intentions. Not just 
we, but Lebedev, member of the Military Council, did not these 
first two days know on whom to rely and whom to recognize and 
whom not to recognize. 
<H5>  Kim Il-Song Comes to Us </H5>
  Kim Il-song showed up at our section on 22 August 1945 in 
the 
latter part of the day. He said, if I am not mistaken, that 
General Lebedev had recommended that he report here. 
  Kim arrived without any soldiers or an adjutant. Our khaki 
field uniform, service cap of the rifle troops, box-calf boots, 
and the Order of the Red Banner. The young Korean officers of 
the section clustered round him. Questions, cross-questioning. 
  Kim Il-song really was part of a guerrilla detachment 
operating in the areas of Manchuria bordering Korea. Prior to 
this he had lived in a rural locality on the territory of China. 
There, according to him, he completed seven grades of a Chinese 
rural school. The officers of the section observed that he did 
not, evidently, have a great command of Korean, although they 
themselves were far from perfection. 
  As Kim himself told me, he and a group of Korean and Chinese 
citizens had, under pressure from Japan's punitive detachments 
endeavoring to clean up the rear areas in connection with the 
country's entry into the war against the United States, crossed 
our border. An international brigade, which numbered 
approximately 300 Chinese and Koreans, was formed from such 
defectors in 1942. They were quartered in the village of 
Vyatskoye near Khabarovsk. Kim Il-song was appointed commander 
of this brigade, and Wang Song, whom I had met twice, commissar. 
The rank of captain was established for Kim Il-song, and for 
Wang Song, major. According to the establishment, the brigade 
was called 1st Battalion, 88th Brigade. 
  This Korean-Chinese international subunit organized drills 
itself, under the supervision of counterintelligence officers. 
Political classes and political information sessions were held, 
and combat training was performed. Much time was allotted for 
domestic chores. 
  There had been no orientation toward Kim prior to the start 
of the war with Japan. No one knew who would be the head of a 
liberated Korea. Everyone was kitted out for the march. Wang 
Song and Kim Il-song were presented with the Order of the Red 
Banner. Only subsequently would these decorations be formalized 
by an order of General Purkayev, commander of the front (almost 
a week after Kim, wearing the decoration on his chest, arrived 
in Korea). 
  After General Chistyakov's departure, the headquarters staff 
loaded up the cars. Our section traveled in the first train. Kim 
Il-song and a group of Koreans, in the second train, this group 
having been pushed forward by the officer who had been assigned 
to it. The Soviet Army uniform, the decoration, and the 
assistance of the SMERSH officer enabled Kim to enter Pyongyang 
on 22 August. 
  The myth that he had for 14 years been in command of a large 
formation, kept virtually all Japanese forces in Manchuria on a 
state of alert, smashed enemies on land, stormed ports, and 
commanded an armored formation on an offensive was needed to 
elevate Kim to the level of hero in order to use him for work in 
Korea. The Soviet propaganda authorities not only did not 
prevent these rumors, they encouraged them and augmented them in 
the press and on the radio. 
  On 23 August 1945 Section Chief V.V. Kovyzhenko received the 
order--disguise Kim, get the Order of the Red Banner as far away 
as possible. 
  Work was in full swing. We were rendered inestimable 
assistance by (Pak Den Ay) and her husband (Kim Yem Bom). They 
procured two suits: one was clearly too small, the other fit. I 
said: "Well, try sitting down!" Kim sat down, and his pants 
split below the fly. (Pak Den Ay) cheered us up: "Never mind! 
I'll solve the problem in a flash," and she sewed up the fly. A 
normal, everyday occurrence. 
  In the yard I took a photograph of Kim Il-song in this suit, 
sporting a striped necktie. This was the first photograph of Kim 
in Korea. It was in this suit that he attended the Communist 
Party congress. 
<H5>  First Communist Party of Korea Congress </H5>
  Kim's first step en route to the throne was the Communist 
Party of Korea congress held on 28 August 1945 in Pyongyang. For 
some reason or other, our historians have little to say about 
this congress; the Koreans, on the other hand, are simply silent. 
  We had not shown up in Pyongyang as yet, but the date of the 
congress had been fixed. Moscow knew nothing about the congress 
that was being convened. Those who initiated the convening of 
the first congress were the Communists who in the 1930's had 
been sent into Korea along Communist International Executive 
Committee, Profintern, and Communist Youth International lines. 
(Kim Yem Bom), Vera Tsoy, and their comrades may be put in this 
category. They joined this work as soon as they were released 
from prison, and their actions were perfectly justified; they 
were of the sole conviction that Korea should be together with 
the Soviet Union. 
  The Korean Communist Party had been distinguished by 
factionalism and was dissolved in 1919 by a decision of the 
Comintern Executive Committee. Now Moscow remained silent: 
Banning it was impossible; the mechanism of the convening of the 
congress had been engaged. 
  General Lebedev, member of the Military Council, demanded 
that we get Kim Il-song ready for the congress and present the 
Russian text of his speech on 25 August. Three days remained. We 
set about writing the speech. The text was ready in half a day. 
The approximate contents of Kim Il-song's speech which I handed 
over to the Korean Workers Party History Institute 40 years 
later are as follows: "The role of the Soviet Army in the 
liberation of Korea, urgent tasks of the Communists for creating 
and strengthening the organs of power, the land issue, and 
Lenin's theory of the building of socialism and its application 
under the conditions of the Korean revolution." 
  General Lebedev approved the contents. "Get Kim ready," he 
said. We began to translate the speech into Korean, then gave 
the speech to Kim for him to study it (it was approximately five 
typewritten pages). We were well aware that he had while in the 
international brigade studied Marxism-Leninism for three years 
and that this speech would not be very difficult for him. 
  The congress opened in a red-brick home. It was arranged 
that 
(Kim Yem Bom) would nominate Kim Il-song for the Presidium and 
give a brief description of his services to the people. 
  And here was Kim in the Presidium. He spoke on day two. A 
section officer from the ranks of our Koreans who had checked 
his speech against a second copy notified me: "All is in order. 
He interposed only a few words." I asked Kim in the future to 
insert fewer of his own words. 
  We received the instruction: No decisions to be adopted at 
the congress, no working bodies to be elected, elect an 
organizing bureau, and work on the program and rules. Kim 
submitted precisely these proposals. They were adopted. Moscow's 
hand was being felt already. Moscow's decision to form an 
alternative party was adopted subsequently and transmitted here, 
to Korea. The formation of this party was entrusted to Kim's 
best friend--(Tsoy Yen Gen). 
  Subsequently a joint congress of the two parties was 
convened. The Communist Party and the People's Party united. The 
Workers Party of Korea was formed. Kim Il-song was elected 
general secretary of the party. 
  Moscow evidently believed that by manipulating the names of 
the parties it could fog the brains of its ideological 
adversaries. Such party conversion became the fashion. 
<H5>  The Next Step </H5>
  Following a recommendation of Vera Tsoy, in this third week 
of August we selected for ourselves apartments in homes that had 
previously belonged to Japanese. 
  Kim Il-song took up quarters opposite (Kim Yem Bom). My 
apartment--next door to Kim's--was separated from his house 
merely by a low fence and a slope. Further on, behind me, was 
(Tsoy Yen Gen)--the future minister of defense--and next to him, 
(Mu Den)--commander of the new military formations of Koreans. 
So we rubbed shoulders with the future leader daily. 
  Moon (I forget his last name), who had been released from 
prison and who had a good knowledge of Russian, became infected 
with the idea of the immediate formation of a youth union of 
Korea, although he was already around 35-40. We reported this to 
higher levels. Colonel General Shtykov, who had assumed the 
office of ruler of Korea on the part of the CPSU Central 
Committee Politburo, gave the go-ahead, and the work began. 
  I was entrusted with preparing the Democratic Youth Union 
Rules. I did not spend long thinking about it and took as the 
basis the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] 
Rules. Moon and I got together in my apartment, extracted from 
the VLKSM Rules what, in our opinion, was unnecessary, and added 
what could impart to the new union a national coloration. It was 
reported to Shtykov. He approved. We prepared a very brief 
speech for Kim Il-song. It was decided: Let the delegates say 
all that they want. 
  The congress opened at the end of October (at the start of 
November, possibly). Moon delivered a prepared report. Then, to 
applause, Kim Il-song spoke. A bureau and bureau 
secretary--Moon--were elected. The young people accepted Kim as 
planned. 
  The press and radio gave the congress and Kim Il-song's role 
in the formation of the Youth Union extensive coverage. Kim 
Il-song ascended one further rung of his Olympus. 
<H5>  KGB General Anokhin Made the Decision </H5>
  A prominent place in the history of the national liberation 
movement of Korea belongs not to Kim Il-song but to Cho Man-sik, 
whom Lieutenant General Furukawa, fulfilling the decree of 
Emperor Hirohito, had been forced to release from confinement. 
  General Chistyakov accepted the surrender in premises in 
which the occupant for four days had been Cho Man-sik. The faith 
in him and the respect for him were noticeable. By the end of 
August the Pyongyang People's Committee had become the central 
committee and had brought all the provincial committees under 
its jurisdiction. The question arose: Whom to support? Moscow 
finally rested its choice on Kim Il-song, and to firmly 
establish Kim Il-song the machinery of the KGB was set in motion. 
  General Lebedev proposed that I present myself to Major 
General Anokhin, chief of counterintelligence of the 25th Army: 
"He has something going on there. He is requesting assistance in 
work with the captive Lieutenant General Furukawa." I reported 
to General Anokhin; he was interrogating Furukawa. Anokhin was 
seeking an answer to the question of how Cho Man-sik was 
released. The Japanese general had allegedly told Cho Man-sik: 
"People's committees are already being organized there. Go and 
take the position of committee chairman." 
  I expressed doubt. Furukawa had simply let fall the words: 
"People's committees are being formed there." "I will write 
down," Anokhin told me, "that Furukawa installed Cho Man-sik as 
chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee." I did not at that 
time believe that the KGB could operate so crudely. This is 
precisely what happened. After this entry, Moscow sent for 
Furukawa, and Cho Man-sik was declared an agent of Japanese 
imperialism. Thus began the displacement of the hero of the 
national liberation movement. 
  It subsequently became known that Cho Man-sik had in recent 
days been conversing by telephone with Southern Korea, Seoul, 
Syngman Rhee, his associate in the struggle. All this was in the 
press and on radio. The hero of Korea had become its enemy, and 
Kim Il-song, whom we had installed, a hero. 
  In the latter half of October (?) Cho Man-sik was placed 
under house arrest, and I do not know what happened to him 
subsequently, but it is firmly believed that he was removed as 
an obstacle to the development of our candidates. 
  All means were employed to discredit a person who had lost 
his health and who had renounced all earthly blessings for the 
sake of the freedom of Korea. It was impossible for anyone to 
raise a voice of protest. The KGB operated crudely, but 
productively. 
  Kim Il-song stepped over the rung over which the corpse of 
Cho Man-sik was draped and ascended to a third, higher rung. 
Moscow's will was done. 
<H5>  The Main Test for the Office of `Great Leader' </H5>
  The decision was made at the top: Prepare and stage a mass 
meeting, at which Kim Il-song is presented to the entire Korean 
people. This meeting was scheduled for 14 October 1945. Its 
venue--the stadium at the foot of Mount Moranpong. All the 
provinces were invited. 
  It was necessary by the time of this meeting: 
  --to have shown that Kim Il-song was a real person, that 
Paektu Mountain tiger about which the press was speaking; 
  --to have widely publicized the venality of Cho Man-sik; 
  --to have staged a meeting between Kim and his relatives (to 
have found them, wherever they were, and to have brought them to 
the village of [Mangende], which is 13-14 km from Pyongyang); 
  --to have exposed the "false" information of the South 
Korean 
press and radio to the effect that Kim Il-song was not Kim 
Il-song but someone else--a figurehead; 
  --to have proven that Kim had been engaged in active 
fighting 
against the Japanese aggressors and had liberated the 
motherland. To have shown at the same time that Syngman Rhee was 
a puppet of the United States and lackey of the American 
imperialists. 
  There was a great deal of work--the entire machinery had no 
time off. There were sleepless nights also, but we coped and 
sharpened the teeth of the Paektu Mountain tiger. 
  In the embassy lobby, (Kvon Khi Gen), ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the DPRK in the USSR, 
showed me a huge portrait of Kim painted on the wall. Alongside 
was a blue lake, and behind the lake there was a village with 
little houses in the style of a Buddhist retrospective. I said 
that I had not seen anything like that at that time. "This is 
(Mangende)!" he said. I visited this (Mangende) twice. Some 
relatives were brought to the village, correspondents were 
summoned, and the squalid peasant houses were photographed. This 
went on until 14 October 1945. We asked our superiors: "What 
should we do? They are putting Kim's portraits in the columns in 
front of Stalin's." "Let them put them in front of Marx's, 
even," was the response. 
  I would like to explain in advance that my comrades and I, 
everyone who worked with Kim Il-song at that time, did their 
duty knowingly and with a will on preparing him for work--it was 
impossible to do otherwise. In addition, our attitude toward 
him, as a person for whom it was difficult getting into the 
part, was good! 
  As of 1 October, it was announced on the radio several times 
a day that a meeting would be held at Moranpong Stadium. The 
words: "It is possible that Kim Il-song will be present at the 
meeting!" "It is possible that Kim Il-song, the leader of our 
people, will be present at the meeting!" "It is possible that 
our legendary hero will be present at the meeting!" and so 
forth, were inserted in every announcement here. 
  The speech, on which not only we but also the superior 
authorities worked, was of a program nature. It was not one of 
those hastily concocted speeches that our section used to 
prepare, but a considered, serious speech, which had even been 
perused in Moscow, possibly. The meeting was more than 
successful. We had taken a larger step toward Kim Il-song's 
ultimate assumption of the office of chairman of the People's 
Committee. Cho Man-sik had gone. In two months we had made Kim 
the leader, and subsequently, several years later, he would 
become "Great." 
<H5>  The Grenade's Flight Trajectory </H5>
  One further large-scale political demonstration was planned: 
holding a mass meeting devoted to the friendship of the Korean 
and Soviet peoples. It was decided to time it to coincide with 
National Liberation Day. 
  In the columns, on the viewing stand, and on the buildings 
adjoining the railroad station were appeals for the eternal 
friendship of the two peoples. A letter from the Korean people 
to the Soviet people was read out from the stand. It contained, 
as we had thought when we were preparing this letter, the 
felicitous thought suggested by Senior Lieutenant Cho Ki-chong, 
who worked on the newspaper CHOSON SINMUM: "As long as the 
shining waters of the Tumen River flow and as long as the 
magnificent Paektu Mountain stands, the friendship of the Korean 
and Soviet peoples will grow and strengthen." 
  I wrote in my recollections for the Workers Party of Korea 
History Institute: "I was getting ready to take my amateur 
closeup. I heard a hissing and saw smoke. A grenade, which by 
chance did not make it into this shot, in which representatives 
of the province of Sinuiju were seated on the steps of the 
viewing stand, was flying toward the stand. Junior Lieutenant 
Ya.T. Novichenko, who had with his platoon been assigned to the 
detail maintaining order and looking out for the security of the 
persons on the viewing stand, was standing next to me. In a 
split second he had climbed over the two steps and grabbed the 
grenade, but was not in time to hurl it away from the stand. The 
grenade exploded. He survived. I raised up him slightly. Two 
soldiers of the Korean People's Army and his platoon sergeant 
took hold of the wounded man and dispatched him to the hospital. 
  The viewing stand was no less than 30 meters long. Section 
Chief V.V. Kovyzhenko was standing on the platform three meters 
from the explosion. The authorities, including Kim Il-song, were 
30 meters away, in front of the left microphone. This explosion 
of the home-made grenade could be heard by a negligible part of 
the participants in the meeting standing in front of the 
platform. The powerful voice of (Kim Yem Bom) conveyed this 
incident to the inhabitants of the whole city. The entire blame 
was heaped on Syngman Rhee and the American imperialists. The 
explosion of the grenade added, as it were, to our arguments in 
the anti-American propaganda. 
  Illustrating this action earlier had been impossible. 
Everything was classified. The propaganda wave was raised later. 
Particularly when Kim Il-song made his first tour of the 
countries of the socialist camp from 16 May through 1 July 1984. 
  Novichenko's exploit became an exploit in the name of Kim 
Il-song and the salvation of Kim Il-song. 
  It was written that Novichenko, standing on the platform, 
had 
jumped up and grabbed the grenade, which was allegedly flying 
toward the place where Kim Il-song was standing. I looked into 
this version with Yakov Tikhonovich himself: We established that 
there had been no such trajectory--the grenade was flying toward 
the area in front of the stand, to its right. It was then that 
doubts and questions arose with us: 
  Why had we stuck to the version to the effect that the 
grenade was flying straight toward Kim Il-song and that the 
junior lieutenant had leaped up (Colonel General Chistyakov, 
commander of the Army, was not present on the viewing stand but 
describes the scene such as to indicate that he saw the way the 
grenade was flying and how Novichenko had leaped up)? 
  Why was the home-made grenade thrown by the agents of 
American imperialism so feeble? If it had not been picked up, 
the officer could have gotten away with a lighter wound. A woman 
standing alongside sustained a slight leg wound, and elderly 
people sitting next to her, back injuries, but those who were 
two or three strides away on the viewing stand (Major Kovyzhenko 
included) were not injured. There was no intention to shoot to 
kill, evidently. 
  Were the opponents of the new system unable to find if only 
one real grenade for Kim Il-song? 
  There is no clear proof that the explosion was staged. Nor 
was this in any way apropos at that time. The trajectory was 
changed. Was this really important? What was important was that 
the trajectory of the entire course of social development of the 
DPRK was warped, just like that of the grenade. 
  I would observe that at meetings held prior to this the 
leadership had always been at the center of the platform. On 
this occasion it was for some reason or other on the left side 
of the lengthy stand. And the grenade was thrown at the right 
side of the stand, where the guests or minor officials were 
positioned. So the action did not pursue the aim of 
assassination of the "leader of the Korean people," the aim was 
to create a big political outburst among the people and rouse 
them to hatred of the American and Syngman Rhee regimes. And, of 
course, to exalt Kim Il-song. The KGB's action produced 
"positive" results. 
  The explosion of hatred for the Syngman Rhee regime in Korea 
was for our country undoubtedly more valuable than the right 
hand of a junior lieutenant. 
<H3>  How the `Great' Kim Il-song and K.U. Chernenko, General 
Secretary of the CPSU, Made a Film About the Great Friendship </H3>
  From May through July 1984 Kim Il-song paid visits to all 
countries of the socialist camp. A meeting with Yakov Novichenko 
had been prepared for him on the platform of Novosibirsk 
Station. "He warmly embraced the Siberian" and...."called him a 
symbol of Korean-Soviet friendship." Prior to this, a decree on 
the conferment on him of the title of Hero of Labor of the DPRK 
had been registered. 
  At the talks with Chernenko, Kim Il-song proposed the 
shooting of a two-part feature film, the basis of which was to 
be Novichenko's exploit. The proposal was joyfully accepted, 
and....the wheels were set in motion. Features on Yakov 
Tikhonovich's exploit had appeared in SELSKAYA ZHIZN, SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA, and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA by this time. The shooting of the 
film was entrusted at the Mosfilm [Moscow Feature Film Studio] 
to the famous director Eldor Urazbayev. 
  Since it was impossible for the film not to contain 
operations of our troops in the liberation of Korea, I expressed 
my doubts in a letter to Shauro, head of the CPSU Central 
Committee Culture Department, dated 23 January 1985 as to the 
possibility of a correct illustration of our Army's operations 
and declared plainly that Korea would in the film, evidently, be 
liberated by Kim Il-song himself. I received a reply, the 
meaning of which was that it was not my business and that I 
should keep my nose out of these matters. But since my brief 
essays had been carried in two newspapers, Mosfilm decided to 
invite me for a consultation. At an enlarged session of the 
Mosfilm Party Committee, I and Novichenko were asked many 
questions about Kim Il-song and the action of Yakov Tikhonovich. 
In the end I declared: "The film will not be a success. Our 
Korean comrades will make it such as to suit Kim Il-song." 
  In a private conversation with Director Urazbayev, I had 
asked that the filming of the mass meeting show hanging on the 
viewing stand a poster about Korean-Soviet friendship, although 
I knew in advance that it would not contain even this trifle 
either. Kim Il-song's national socialism expressed in his Chuche 
philosophy was too strong. 
  The film was made. Kim Il-song routs the Japanese forces on 
land and at sea. The Soviet Army appears indistinctly somewhere 
here and there. He fights his way to Pyongyang. Victory! The 
shots of the operations of our troops and others taken by 
Urazbayev were not found suitable. 
<H5>  Who Are These `Bad People' and How Many Are There of Them </H5>
  At a dinner given by (Kvon Khi Gen), ambassador 
extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary of the DPRK in the USSR, the guests and the 
host were seated at a round table. Behind each guest was a young 
Korean woman in national dress. Accompanying us was an agent of 
the KGB. This had long been the custom, evidently--any visit to 
any embassy would be accompanied by the attachment to the guests 
of a KGB agent. In this case he was called a representative of 
Mosfilm. 
  In the course of the dinner, the ambassador invited us into 
the film hall to view a film on the great leader's visit to the 
socialist countries. In color and with skillfully chosen camera 
angles, it made a dispiriting impression on me. Kim Il-song in 
splendor, one foot forward, his face radiant, his mouth, as 
always, half-open, his service jacket of the Stalin-Mao Zedong 
cut. Chernenko looked frail and bowed. He looked the same next 
to Honecker, Zhivkov, Ceausescu, and others. 
  At table, after the showing, I was asked: "Whom else did you 
know?" I replied: (Kim Yem Bom, Pak Den Ay). "They are bad 
people!" (Kvon Khi Gen) said. I recall Kim Tu-pong, who became 
chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium. "What do 
you mean, what do you mean? He is a bad person!" the ambassador 
said. All right, I thought, I'll talk about (Tsoy Yen Gen), 
Kim's best friend. They ate cabbage soup together for three 
years at Khabarovsk, and, in addition, in the Korean adventure 
of 1950-1953 he held the position of secretary for defense.... 
He proved to be a "bad person" also. 
  "And what did you like in the field of art and culture?" I 
recalled a wonderful ballerina, about whom our press was writing 
at that time--(Tsoy Syn Khi). I attended her concerts. Star of 
the East was what she was called even in Southern Korea. I had 
not finished speaking about her before the embassy secretary 
interrupted: "No, no! She is an enemy!" 
  No one knows how many "bad people" there were in the DPRK. 
Perhaps there were even more relative to its population of 11 
million than with us. 
<H5>  Parameters of Honor and Conscience </H5>
  In 1946 at mass meetings in Pyongyang in honor of May Day 
and 
the anniversary of the Great October, balconies, fences, and 
walls of houses were covered with posters devoted to the 20 
years of generalship of Kim Il-song. We subtract from 1946 the 
year in which Kim Il-song was born. We are left with 34. We take 
20 from 34 and are left with 14. This is the age at which the 
military commander was born. In our times he is a 
generalissimo.... Mankind has yet to devise a higher rank for 
Kim Il-song. But what is most interesting is that at the age of 
14 he had not even completed the seventh grade of the Chinese 
rural school and could not read and write properly. 
  I have in front of me a work of his son, Kim Chong-il, 
written on 17 October 1982, a work of that same Kim Chong-il, 
who, still in short pants and seated on his father's lap, took 
aim at me with a pistol in 1946. The work is called "The Workers 
Party of Korea--the Chuche Revolutionary Party--Inheritor of the 
Glorious Traditions of the Anti-Imperialist Alliance." This 
"study" was devoted to the "56th anniversary of the founding by 
Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader, of the Anti-Imperialist 
Alliance--AIA." 
  We subtract 56 from 1982. We are left with 26. We subtract 
the year in which Kim Il-song was born, we are left with that 
same 14. He was at this 14, apparently, not only a military 
commander but also a great politician. Where did Kim get all 
this from? It all came from us. We taught him to lie. In 1945 he 
was unable to put together decent notes for a speech at the 
political classes, despite the program's demands for the study 
of Russian, and had not in three years mastered the basics of 
Marxism-Leninism, and 19 years before this he was the 
outstanding founder of the AIA. 
  "In 1926, having formed the AIA, he took" (as his son's work 
says) "the helm of the revolution and transformed Northern Korea 
into a country of model socialism." 
  In the meager pamphlet Kim Chong-il calls his father the 
"Great Leader" 60 times. In an illustrated magazine in 
Russian--KOREYA--the authors of various articles call the 
leader's son, Kim Chong-il, "beloved leader" 40 times. 
  They outdid us. We had this also, but somewhat less. They 
are 
from that same CPSU Central Committee Politburo mold loaded with 
the ready-made cadres necessary for the victory of communism 
throughout the world. 
  Speaking about the role of the philosophy of Chuche, Kim 
Chong-il, the son of the great one, writes: "It is essential 
that we continue to move steadfastly forward along the 
revolutionary path, which starts from Paektu Mountain, and 
brilliantly complete the Chuche revolutionary cause, the cause 
of socialism and communism." 
  In addition, Chuche philosophy, in the opinion of the son, 
"should be the theoretical basis for the victory of communism 
worldwide and should raise the value of man to the highest 
level" (Kim Chong-il. "Conversation with party officials dealing 
with questions of theory, 2 April 1974"). 
  What, in fact, is the point of reproaching Kim Il-song and 
gauging the parameters of his honor and conscience? He is, after 
all, copied from us. He is as we used to be. We had the same 
military commanders and theorists. We extolled him and praised 
him in such a way that he did in actual fact decide that he was 
great. It is hard now to persuade him that he with his 
mumbo-jumbo--Chuche philosophy--is an ignoramus. 
  General Shtykov ordered me by telephone to take in at my 
quarters Kim's friend--Wang Song, commissar of the international 
brigade--and not let him out. But Wang kept asking and asking to 
see Kim. I reported to the general that Wang was dying to see 
Kim. "All right," the general said, "take him, but have him back 
by nightfall." 
  ....We drank vodka, then wine, by the glass. We switched to 
tumblers. Kim's wife and soldiers served appetizers. At my 
request we all switched to Russian. Wang, a head shorter than 
Kim, animated, agile, spare, drank and did not become 
intoxicated. But Kim turned sour.... "They will get to know 
about us yet.... We will be appreciated yet!" he said. He was 
not mistaken. We got to know, we cultivated, and we appreciated. 
So who is he? Not, of course, a military commander, not a 
theorist, and not a philosopher, and a leader in the broad 
meaning of this word even less. A simple and obedient 
border-crosser who came within the sights of our intelligence 
authorities. More precisely, he was more obliging, far from 
having any ideas of his own, and capable of repeating what was 
suggested to him. 
  In the European socialist countries, the leaders were 
selected the same way. If they went wrong, they were replaced, 
and new ones were picked and installed. But here, forever, and 
with Asian singularities and brutality. 
  In Korea we were frequently asked about other Kims, and 
names 
were cited. But this was no longer any use to anyone. The choice 
had been made. The raw "product" was polished up and brought to 
a shine. And, as you can see, we produced quite a shine! 
  Well, all right, I thought at that time, we have glorified 
him in order to have our man in foreign parts. But we now we 
must stop. Let his own nation, his own people, appreciate him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serik Shayakhmetuly Aqymbekov, recorded by </F>
Seydakhmet Mukhametshe: To Establish the Power of the Nation.] 
  [Text] [Mukhametshe] Serik Shayakhmetuly sir! Four months 
have passed since you took over the administration of the 
oblast. Have you been able to make plans for the tasks you plan 
to accomplish? What have investigations of the present status of 
the oblast economy shown. 
  [Aqymbekov] It is true that time moves on. A great deal of 
time passes before you know it. Present difficulties are 
well-known to the people. We cannot say that the economic crisis 
in our country has left our oblast untouched. Conditions are in 
truth nothing to feel at ease about. During the last seven 
months, production of industrial products declined by 4.8 
percent compared to the same period in 1992. Conditions in 
agriculture are likewise poor. 
  [Mukhametshe] The primary wealth of the oblast lies in 
cattle 
and crops. These two sectors are also in difficulty. Increases 
in livestock and production are below 1990 levels. What is the 
reason? 
  [Aqymbekov] This is a good question. The smaller increases 
in 
livestock and in production are alarming us. In particular, 
during the last year 15,800 fewer large cattle, 86,300 fewer 
sheep and goats, 3,200 fewer horses, and 30,300 fewer pigs were 
produced. These are not good signs. When we talk about 
agriculture, we must not forget that, above all, this is the 
sector which provides food to the people. If the economic crisis 
continues, it is doubtful that we will be able to get out of our 
circle of difficulties. Today complacency and irresponsibility 
have become endemic. There is no profit where there is no order. 
This being the case, what should we do? We must put our efforts 
into unwavering fulfillment of the edicts of the president of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan. We must do this if we are going to 
put a forceful halt to the deficiencies and the inadequacies 
which have arisen in our society. We, for our part, are not 
sitting on our hands: we have taken in hand some specific 
measures for the development of animal husbandry. We are in the 
process of carrying out important measures in the delivery and 
the storage of agricultural products. It will not be possible to 
put things to rights in a single day. We are thinking in terms 
of gradually restoring balance. However, it is important that 
the economic independence of agriculture and industry be 
protected. We will need the active assistance, above all, of 
organizations protecting rights in dealing with questions of 
order. 
  [Mukhametshe] It would seem as if you have formed your own 
shadow government in the area of agricultural management: rural 
areas are now managed simultaneously by the Agricultural 
Inspectorate and by the Awyl Industrial Corporation. Just how 
efficient is this? 
  [Aqymbekov] At one time everything was in the hands of a 
totalitarian system. At that time the administrative organs were 
the support of a command system. Now times have changed. 
Property has gradually moved from state supervision into the 
hands of labor organizations and of individuals. Giving orders 
to them as was once done by administrative organs is contrary to 
law and is not much needed. We must change and reform 
administrative organs in accordance with the needs of the times. 
Based upon just this principle, we divided the former 
agricultural administration into two parts at the beginning of 
the year. We went over to an oblast agricultural administration 
and an oblast inspectorate for the agro-industrial complex. A 
second structure, the Agro-Industry Commercial Corporation, 
provides services to enterprises and is involved with organizing 
their work. Such changes in organizational efforts will 
certainly be producing results soon. In any case, a great deal 
depends upon the carrying out of economic reforms. 
  [Mukhametshe] We think that the primary way of getting out 
of 
the economic dead end which is exhausting us is the market 
economy. However, we are encountering managers who are taking 
advantage of the difficulties for their own benefit. When others 
are lacking for housing, such people have colluded, purchased 
houses, and rushed out to buy foreign cars. In particular, they 
seem to have taken advantage of the first stage of privatization 
for all kinds of tricks among the people... 
  [Aqymbekov] The requirements of law were not completely 
observed during the first stage of privatization. It is now 
becoming clear what kinds of deficiencies there were. Due to a 
shortage of financing and a lack of building materials, 
construction of residential housing by the government was halted 
entirely. Residential housing was privatized. However, some 
persons in managerial positions got control of many goods at 
that time. If there were managers concerned about the people, 
they were in difficulty and unable to look after themselves. It 
is not proper to be extremely smug and to say that this is what 
was involved in privatization. There is always a need for a 
sense of civil honor, humanitarianism, and humane intentions. Do 
not our people say: people live with people. 
  [Mukhametshe:] In order to raise the level of the oblast 
economy we have no choice but to carry out exchanges and trade. 
In this connection, what can you say about external economic 
connections? Are there goods which you can export? 
  [Aqymbekov] We must systematize our external economic 
connections. With this goal in mind a special coordinating 
committee has been formed in our oblast. There are now 
functioning in the oblast 26 consolidated industries. We are in 
the process of establishing profitable and effective 
relationships between our oblast and countries such as China, 
Turkey, Korea, and Italy. There are some enterprises which have 
emerged as a consequence. Specific plans are being drawn up 
regarding various projects, including the construction of a 
paper combine in Taldyqorghan City. One thousand hectares of 
sugar beets were planted this year using advanced French 
technology, 600 hectares were planted using German technology. 
Likewise, we plan to grow grain on 15,000 hectares using 
Hungarian methods. Great assistance is being rendered on the 
part of the government of the Republic with regard to the 
introduction of advanced technology designed to increase 
agricultural productivity. 
  Our oblast in economic terms has an agrarian character. For 
that reason, we import much more than we export. There are 
outstanding export products. Among the various kinds of 
products, demand for storage batteries and sugar beets is the 
greatest. We can meet, at certain levels, demand for onions, 
meat, and milk products. We are seeking new channels of 
communication in our efforts to deliver needed goods and 
implements to the people of the Zhetisu, utilizing all our 
existing resources. 
  [Mukhametshe] It is proper that foreign investors have been 
brought in. However, Taldyqorghan is a border oblast. It is 
possible that among those flowing into the oblast from outside 
are certain other persons along with those with friendly ideas. 
In particular, the people have been extremely alarmed by the 
news that many from our great neighbors to the east are settling 
in the oblast. 
  [Aqymbekov] We must rely on foreign investors for the 
development of the oblast economy. The geographic position of 
the Zhetisu is very convenient for external relations. We must 
utilize this productively. I understand that there are things 
alarming the people. However, should we fail to take advantage 
of favorable circumstances? There are the appropriate 
authorities: they will look into the circumstances of the 
question. There are rumors that persons from a neighboring 
country have been entering illegally. This is not true. To be 
sure, there are people entering the country. Most of them are 
involved in commerce. In short, we are looking into this 
question carefully. It is proper to avoid raising the alarm 
among the people or stirring things up with idle words and 
lending credence to every rumor we hear. 
  [Mukhametshe] There is another question which I am dying to 
ask. In recent years our relatives and kinsmen in foreign 
countries have migrated. Among them are masters of various 
specialties. However, we have been unable to place those 
newcomers in their chosen specialties. Why have they been sent 
out to herd sheep? Is there no other possible occupation for a 
Kazakh than herding sheep?... 
  [Aqymbekov] It is to be sure a joy that our kinsmen in 
distant places are returning to the homeland. What Kazakh is 
there who is not rejoicing about this when they encounter one 
another? Is there not the proverb: if one extra sheep is born, a 
little bit more wormwood will grow?... Since 1991 more than 850 
families have moved to our oblast from Mongolia and the CIS 
countries. Just recently 126 families from Iran have settled in 
the Zhetisu. We are doing everything we can to help them. We are 
providing them aid in the form of housing, livestock, material 
goods, and money. We are providing a work placement for our 
migrant kinsmen. We try to place them in area of their 
specialty. Placing those with the specialties of teacher or 
doctor is not very difficult. However, it is not easy to place 
our relatives with specialties in the agricultural sector. 
Second, everywhere workers are being laid off in connection 
withthe transition to a market economy. For that reason we have 
taken in hand the retraining and preparation of our migrant 
kinsmen in needed specialties. Just now 76 persons are acquiring 
new specialties in the oblast. As for sending them off to herd 
sheep: herding sheep is our traditional occupation. Have we not 
for generations, when asking how are you, first about the cattle 
and then about the person. It is not proper to denigrate this 
occupation or to detract from it. You understand that your 
question is out-of-date. In those days did we not scare a child 
who was poor at his school work with the occupation of 
herdsmen?.. In my view there are no good and bad jobs. 
  [Mukhametshe] In any case, when the president named you 
governor, he gave you all [necessary] powers. The new governor 
has the right to form a new administration. You are working with 
the old apparatus. Are you satisfied with their work? What 
changes have you made in cadre matters? 
  [Aqymbekov] I was born in the oblast. I knew from before not 
only the circumstances in the Zhetisu region and the state of 
the economy, but most of the cadres in the administration. The 
spirit of the times and the changes taking place require 
competence from managers and specialists, new thinking and a 
carefully considered citizenship. For that reason, in choosing 
and in placing persons to govern the nation, my first priority 
was whether or not they embodied such characteristics. During 
part of last year I held an official post in Almaty. It is now a 
time of rapid social change. During these times the lives of 
most of us and out views of life have changed. During the time 
that I have been governor of the oblast, I have looked with very 
critical eyes on some serving with me. I wanted to determine 
what kinds of changes had taken place in themselves, in their 
views, and in their work styles. I noticed that many cadres were 
unable to work at levels demanded by life. In any case, it seems 
as if some citizens have not put down their foundations distant 
from what is old. For that reason it is clear that changes are 
being made in the composition of cadres. Relying on those able 
to meet the demands of the times, I am making an effort to 
fulfill the great tasks which stand before me. I am putting new 
thinking young people into the positions of cadres who learned 
their lessons from yesterday. 
  [Mukhametshe] You are a regular reader and regular author of 
YEGEMEN QAZAQSTAN. You have given many interviews. You have 
written articles on specific problems. We thank you for your 
activism. As you know, there is the rubric in the paper: Be a 
Governor Close to the People. Do you like these words? 
  [Aqymbekov] If I can go a little more deeply into your 
thought: a governor is only a person who holds a leading public 
office. But how far from the people is that official personage? 
Only after becoming part of the people was he named governor. 
Thus, I think it natural that a governor should remain close to 
the people. From that point of view, I think that I am never far 
from the people. However, everything else depends upon the 
person in power. For example, are we not products of the trials 
of life along with such characteristics as thought, knowledge, 
ideas, humanitarianism, and control. I think that your papers 
rubric aimed at a new time, at a new point of view. 
  [Mukhametshe] Governor Aqymbekov, what should the 
Kazakhstans 
state ideology be like? Recently we have become embroiled in 
history and are taking all periods into consideration. Whatever 
the circumstances, Kazakhs are divided into clans and are 
endeavoring to praise their ancestors. What do you say to this? 
  [Aqymbekov] It is a social law that there should be a 
national state ideology for a sovereign country. However, what 
should this ideology be like? If we begin the discussion of the 
question from this point of view, and, if we look primarily at 
the past, we will commit a great error. This is the same as not 
tying up the lattice work of a felt yurt and letting an old tent 
rot. For that reason our national ideology must develop from our 
Constitution, from the supreme law of the land. If we are unable 
to establish a new national-state worldview, if our thoughts are 
full of a hodgepodge of ideas, it is possible that we will 
encounter a spiritual crisis. If we do not think now about 
future generations, then our struggle for independence, and all 
our good intentions, will be in vain. The riches of Kazakhstan 
are not just for present generations. They must become the 
property of future generations too. A Republic of Kazakhstan 
ideology will open the way for universal Kazakhstan feelings of 
pride. To this end, it is right to support properly all of those 
with good intentions in the formation of ideas. 
  We must know our history. Our wise people have said: if a 
horse is driven away, it is the enemy; if it pounds, it is the 
wind. For that reason, we must reject division into clans and 
put effort into making our independence constant. There were not 
a few occasions in the past when we were divided from one 
another. Let us somehow become a powerful nation with strong 
unity. For that reason it is proper that we devote our entire 
lives to this goal. 
  [Mukhametshe] Thank you!

<F P=106> [Article by Seyilbek Shawkhamanov, governor of Qyzylorda </F>
Oblast, Kazakhstan peoples deputy: We Have Planted Seeds in the 
Garden of Sovereignty. 
  [Text] The Kazakhs have said: it is easy to get married, 
difficult to establish a household. We have obtained our 
sovereignty. Now we must think about becoming a nation and 
forming a large country which, on a basis of equality and on the 
same level with all the civilized nations, will be able to 
express itself politically and produce economically. That is no 
easy task. To achieve it we must renew our thinking, renew way 
we organize, and renew the way we carry out our tasks. It is a 
wonderful thing that all the internal and external policies of 
the head of the state and of the government are being directed 
at such objectives, and that ways are being sought for getting 
out of the crisis through economic reform. It is a good thing 
that an effort is being made at the presently ongoing session of 
the Supreme Kenges to look in detail at drafts of laws suggested 
for the agenda of parliament members, to discuss them carefully, 
and to look at problems from the point of view of the people. 
All of this is the result of the freedom and liberation which we 
have attained. It is a great achievement and a great spiritual 
victory that the people have gained the right to think about 
their own affairs, to collect themselves, and to look at the 
present and the future. 
  The special quality of sovereignty is that our nation has 
been awakened, that we have returned to our language and our 
religion, and that we have obtained freedom in regulating our 
lives and in going about our businesses. It was no secret that, 
during the time we were under the rule of the former Soviet 
Union, we had to keep our peace in the face of the disorders of 
a planned economy, that we were hesitant to oppose it, and that, 
when we gave a blessing at the head of the table, we were unable 
to console ourselves and we carried a burden in our hearts. The 
demands of independence broke those chains once and for all. 
Now, as is completely obvious, we have taken the economic reins 
into our own hands, and have acquired power as a result of laws 
on local self-government. We are revitalizing the important 
customs and traditions of our nation. This means that no one can 
slap our hands. What else do we need? We must know how to 
organize. We must think about efficient ways to achieve this, 
and we must seek practical means for raising living standards. 
In any case we cannot say that we have solved all the critical 
and difficult economic questions, and that we have eliminated 
all the difficulties plaguing the people during two years. That 
was not possible. However, it is true that we have accomplished 
noteworthy things in strengthening the nation and in laying the 
foundations for tomorrow. 
  Le us take my oblast as an example. When Qyzylorda was once 
mentioned, the image of rice flashed before peoples' eyes. It is 
true that the foundation of our economy is rice growing. This is 
because this was the way it was before. It was decided from 
above what a given region was to be involved in. Instructions 
came down from above as to what crops were to be planted and 
what products produced. This is the value of independence: now 
we ourselves decide what we need, and how to produce it. This 
year we obtained an increase of 105 from every hundred adult 
animals in the oblast and have become one of the leaders. We 
have harvested 47 centners from every hectare of rice. Likewise, 
we are undertaking measures to supply the inhabitants of the 
oblast with local vegetables, fruit, and berry products. At the 
end of the harvest we had threshed 60,000 tons of golden grain. 
By way of comparison, this was 100 kilo each for every 
inhabitant of Qyzylorda, from the crawling baby to the bent old 
man. All of this, in a word, we understand as the fruit of 
freedom provided by sovereignty. 
  Everything, in addition to its positive side, has its down 
side too. We still do not understand the meaning of democratic 
processes. We are not managing economic reform exactly right, 
and we have made erroneous decisions restraining energetic 
development. Difficult days have now begun to be experienced in 
agriculture. Products are being produced, economic indicators 
are high, but this is having a limited effect on maintaining 
living standards. There is disorganization in the pricing 
system. Wages are becoming worthless, and there is looseness in 
finances and in banking. There are deficiencies in the policy of 
social protection. All of this makes any fundamental change in 
agriculture impossible. We are independent. Whatever the 
decision, we have the right to take it into our own hands as we 
see fit and according to circumstances. While this is the case, 
up to the present we have been unable to liberate ourselves from 
the lasso of higher powers. Nonetheless, the view has been 
expressed by those managing the state that we are free to use 
agricultural surplus for state needs at the rayon and oblast 
level. In fact this is not so. The reason is that there are 
licenses and quotas set by the state. We cannot avoid them. Is 
that freedom? Rather than benefiting by such limitations, which 
free us on the one hand and tie us up on the other, we are, in 
my view, being harmed. We have truly gone over to market place 
relationships. Is it not proper then that we should now be 
totally free in all ways? To tell the bitter truth, things like 
trying to solve the agrarian cadre question from a central 
authority is obstruction of the old type. If we cannot free 
ourselves from such a stereotyped psychology, it is doubtful 
that we will be able to strengthen our sovereignty, mobilize 
local people, and gain their understanding. I think that, while 
there should be supervision from afar, there is too much direct 
intervention in [local] administration. No one must have any 
doubts that managers of a region and local people know best the 
situation in local areas. 
  There are 32 sovkhozes in our oblast concerned with sheep 
raising. As I mentioned above, they are among the leaders in 
raising livestock. Compared to last year, there was little loss 
and livestock increased. Nonetheless, we must increase the 
profits of sheep herders and the income of enterprises. However, 
more specifically, the problem is not this at all. The 
sheepherders and enterprises achieved such high rates of 
increase, but ended up at the end of the year with a debt to the 
state of 2 billion rubles. Likewise, there was no way to repay 
on time a loan of 20 billion rubles obtained by the government. 
Why? The reason the loan was late was because of problems 
arising from failure to take agricultural production costs into 
account and because of price instability. What must we do now? 
The 32 sheepraising sovkhozes makeup about half of the state 
enterprises in our oblast. Should we rely on privatization to 
break them up? These days there is little to be gained by 
privatization. For that reason special attention to agriculture 
must be shown by the government. Nonetheless, it would be no 
surprise if, under present circumstances, we should choose to 
deprive ourselves of things which we now have in hand in the 
blink of an eye. It is no secret, tomorrow some sheepherders 
(and they are almost all Kazakhs) will be at the limit of their 
endurance. If we throw away their prop, what will we do then? On 
the contrary, while we express our thanks to them for looking 
after themselves and for their work of mercy on behalf of 
others, are we not forced to consider well-thought-out plans for 
restoring them morally, materially, and linking their 
enterprises? 
  Time is both judge and jury. Our present labor at the very 
beginning of independence will, as time passes, receive 
appropriate evaluation and be judged. One thing is already 
clear, the Declaration of Sovereignty, ratified three years ago, 
opened a new path for Kazakhstan. We have begun to exonerate our 
history which was for a long time dragged in the dust. We have 
renewed vanished spiritual riches. We have made a place in the 
hearts of the masses for the names of our khans, heroes, who 
guarded our nation in a time of difficulty, and who long ago 
knew the entire people. One thing should be mentioned in this 
regard: there have been pronouncements from the mouth of some to 
the effect that these [anniversary] celebrations are getting out 
of hand. At a time that is already difficult enough why are we 
wasting money here and there? In my view this is a sign of 
limited understanding. In fact, through our celebration of the 
festival of some hero are we not honoring the spirits of all the 
people who lived at that time and bowing our heads to all the 
people who suffered the vissitudes of a time? If our people take 
examples from the past, what fault is there in that? Whatever 
nationality a person is, they have a duty to defend their native 
land. It is fact that the heroism of our ancestors, who did not 
give in to hostile enemies, who faced them on all sides, is a 
lesson and a model for us. 
  In short, we have planted seeds in the garden of 
sovereignty. 
The roots are now striking deep, and we must struggle for an 
abundant harvest. The path we have to tread is, in any case, a 
long one. However, if we travel a distant road, will we not draw 
close [to our goal]? For that reason we will achieve something 
by pressing forward without considering the difficulty.

"Dustum's Air Force Drops Bombs on Tajik Refugee Camps in 
Afghanistan"] 
  [Text] HORASAN information agency, set up by Tajik refugee 
journalists in Afghanistan, distributed a report on two air 
raids on Tajik refugee camps in Kunduz--Davra and Maydoni 
Khavoi. According to the reports, aircraft without identifying 
markings conducted air raids on 6 and 16 January, which resulted 
in the death of a woman with a child and tens of wounded. The 
Tajikistan Resistance Council's headquarters confirmed that 
there had been deliberate air bombing attacks on the camps 
which, according to Western journalists' data, are home to about 
20,000 refugees from the former Kurgan-Tyuba Oblast. 
  This essentially is the first armed attack on the refugees. 
There was an incident in the spring of last year, when an 
attempt was made to poison the people in the Sakhi camp near 
Mazar-e Sharif. As a result of this action about 100 people died 
and 500 were brought to Afghan hospitals. A man who had poisoned 
the water, which was brought to the refugees in cisterns, was 
apprehended. He turned out to be a Tajik doctor, who said on 
Afghan television after being apprehended that the action had 
been conceived by Tajik special services. In just one year a 
cemetery set up near the Sakhi camp, which is located in the 
steppe, grew to about 1,000 graves. A correspondent of the 
Japanese newspaper ASAHI, who had visited the Sakhi camp, told 
of the extreme hardships of refugee life. 
  Nevertheless, conditions at least are tolerable for the 
refugees in the Sakhi camp since it is the only camp monitored 
by the UN mission and the International Red Cross. Other camps 
in Afghanistan get their supply of food and necessary medical 
supplies from Muslim countries and organizations. 
  However, the situation that emerged in connection with the 
bombardment of Tajik refugee camps in Kunduz is quite 
explainable. After the unsuccessful storming of Kabul undertaken 
in the early hours of 1 January, General Dustum's units, which 
represent Afghanistan's Uzbek population and are actively 
supported by the Government of Uzbekistan, are trying to shift 
the strike onto the camps. Most likely it is tied to a 
large-scale action conceived with the purpose of liquidating 
Tajik opposition in Afghanistan. It is possible that the air 
force that conducted the raids on the camps does not belong to 
General Dustum, since it is known that his helicopters and 
airplanes are on territory controlled by Dustum's adversary, 
Afghanistan's former minister of defense, Ahmad Shah Massud. 
This happened after General Dustum ordered an air raid on Kabul 
but the pilots--mainly Tajiks and Pashtuns by ethnic 
origin--sided with President Rabbani. According to Tajikistan 
Resistance Council information, the aircraft without identifying 
markings come from the north, from behind the former 
Soviet-Afghan border. 
  The coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in 
the CIS countries has protested this action. The document 
distributed by it describes this as an attempt to derail the 
process of preparation for negotiations between the opposition 
and the current government in Dushanbe. There is no other 
explanation for terrorism against refugees. If this is the case, 
it becomes clear now that General Dustum has always supported a 
pro-communist coup in Tajikistan. The Tajik opposition believes 
that the United Nations and the entire world community should 
urgently investigate this incident and protect the refugees from 
an encroachment on their lives, whoever it comes from.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sh. Odilov, deputy minister of grain </F>
products of the Republic of Tajikistan, by N. Vanichkin; place 
and date not given: "Bread Passion, or Someone's Misfortune"] 
  [Text] A neighbor of mine, a woman in her declining 
years, called Auntie Vera in everyday life, was an inveterate 
optimist. Even the harsh consequences of last year's events 
which are known to all did not shake her faith in a bright 
future. Nothing could shake her: neither the empty shelves in 
the stores nor the long waiting lines in front of the bakeries. 
And I, who am younger, could only envy the unshakable faith of 
this elderly person. And once when I met Auntie Vera with a 
stool in her hand, of course, I could not help but ask her where 
she was setting out for at the break of day. 
  "To look after the grain," was my neighbor's answer. 
Our oldtimers' conversations in the entryway have now moved 
closer to the window where bakery items are sold. We get up a 
little earlier, we get in line, and we share all the news at the 
same time. And you might even end up without any bread. 
Sometimes a "sit-in" in front of the store for a whole day does 
not even help. Not a single bun makes its way to us poor 
pensioners. Everything is snatched away by the "good 
fellows"--young people. And what is surprising is that they take 
it away in sacks and God only knows why they need so much. 
  [Vanichkin] What is the real reason for the severe 
interruptions in the supply of bread for the population that 
have occurred recently? 
  We asked this question of the deputy minister of grain 
products of the Republic of Tajikistan, Sh. Odilov. 
  [Odilov] The situation with bread has indeed become 
critical. 
And there are many reasons for this. Because of the higher cost 
and shortage in the food stores of meat and dairy products, the 
population has begun to consume more bakery items. The situation 
is exacerbated by the lack of small-denomination coupons at the 
trading points. When they are unable to obtain change from 
R5,000 or R10,000 banknotes, many people are forced to buy bread 
in excess of the norm. Panic buying is also stirred up by the 
so-called "wheeler-dealers" in independent trade who speculate 
in bread along with workers in the store. Much of it is acquired 
by owners of private farms to feed their livestock. And while in 
past years internal affairs organs did a certain amount of 
preventive work with those who use bread for other than food 
purposes, today, as you have noted, they cannot impose order 
even in the waiting lines in front of the bread stores. The 
situation is extremely critical with fuel and lubricants as 
well. Because of all this only about 40 percent of the city's 
trade points are supplied with bread products. 
  Enterprises of our branch, in spite of the shortage of yeast 
and other components, are over-fulfilling the daily norm for 
bread baking. And this--believe it or not--is more than 170 
tonnes. We are producing even more than trade is ordering from 
us. We have adequate raw material and capacities. There are even 
possibilities of increasing production. The question hinges on 
the problem of prompt delivery of bakery products to the 
consumers. At the same time in the extremely difficult 
conditions with a shortage of the main food product one must be 
reasonably thrifty and use bread for food purposes. And trade 
workers and also buyers must be conscientious and prevent cases 
of violations in the sale of bakery items. One wishes to hope 
also that internal affairs organs will turn their attention to 
the operation of bread stores and also the illegal actions of 
certain wheeler-dealers in the speculation market. Otherwise it 
could happen that we would end up without enough supplies of raw 
material. And then panic buying could indeed lead us to a bread 
shortage. 
  [Vanichkin] Sharifdzhon Olimovich, you mentioned that there 
are possibilities of increasing the production of bakery 
products. In this connection I do not think it would be out of 
place for you to tell us about how things are going with the 
construction of the new capital bakery, whose production 
capacities, as was anticipated previously, were to be introduced 
at the end of this year. How realistic are these expectations 
today? 
  [Odilov] So far there is nothing to boast about. Although we 
did intend to start up a plant by the New Year and make a kind 
of gift to residents of the capital, this is not likely to 
happen. And here it is not the collective of the enterprise 
under construction or the general contracting organizations 
involved in the construction of this facility who are to blame. 
The builders are working, one might say, day and night. And I am 
not saying this just to sound good. You yourself saw how they 
brought mattresses and blankets to the construction site for 
workers on the second shift. Now everything is set up so that at 
least one line with a capacity of 20 tonnes of rectangular 
loaves of bread a day will go into operation by the end of the 
year. Its startup will make it possible for us to relieve the 
critical strain in supplying the population of the right-bank 
zone with bread products. Of course, this is with stable 
operation of the bread and confectionery combine. 
  [Vanichkin] What is the reason for the adjustment of the 
earmarked plans? 
  [Odilov] The main one is the failure to make payments to 
Russia. Since April of this year we have been unable to settle 
accounts with our suppliers under agreements concluded 
previously. All the equipment we need is ready to send, the 
containers and railroad cars have been ordered, and considerable 
penalty payments are being "accumulated" because of their idle 
time. Naturally, our associates are becoming more mistrustful, 
and this, as you yourself understand, threatens our established 
relations. For example, the warehouse for bulk storage of flour 
today is in urgent need of solid-drawn tubes with an internal 
diameter of 75 mm and wall thickness of 2.5 mm. There are none 
in the republic. We signed a contract with the Moscow Tube Plant 
but we cannot pay for the deliveries. The payments are not going 
through. Thus because the money did not go through for an air 
compressor, 24 units of standard equipment have not been 
delivered. And what can you say. With a normal finance-credit 
system the plant would have gone on-line three months ago. 
  Workers of the main construction administration are letting 
us down too. We do not yet have the blueprints for the boiler, 
although they were to have been turned over on 15 October. I 
understand that the developers are now having difficulties with 
skilled specialists, but since they promised to prepare the 
documentation, they should be so kind as to do it by the 
earmarked deadline. 
  [Vanichkin] Sharifdzhon Olimovich, if the boiler is not 
working, no heat or steam will go to the production facility. 
Consequently even the one production line you plan to start up 
at the end of the year will not go into operation. 
  [Odilov] It is practically impossible to envision ahead of 
time the stage of construction readiness at which the failure 
would come. And there is no one to solve our problems for us. 
But I can assure you with complete confidence that one bread 
baking line will be in operation. The steam and heat will be 
produced according to a temporary plan from the currently 
existing boiler at the Dushanbe bakery-confectionery combine. We 
have also solved the problem of the air compressor. Instead of 
the air collectors that are in short supply we plan to use 
receivers--the Pamir production association promises to deliver 
them to us. True, the work front is still not large, but in the 
next few days we intend to complete all the startup and 
adjustment work on the fourth technological line for bread 
baking. To do this we have organized brigades which are now 
inspecting all the equipment and working on two shifts. 
  The desire of the construction workers to solve the bread 
problem is commendable. But now they too need help. They are in 
extreme need of solid-drawn steel tubes, nonrusting electrodes 
or nonrusting welding wire, and bronze and brass faucets. 
Possibly certain enterprises or organizations have the 
aforementioned equipment. It would be good if any of them would 
help the construction workers. And we will agree to any payment 
conditions: transfer, cash, or barter. I hope that this request 
will not go unnoticed. The entire city needs the bakery, and 
this means that each one of us should be interested in its 
startup.

  [Text] An entire kaleidoscope of different parties 
and movements, each of which is proposing its own strategy of a 
way out of the economic and social and political crisis, has 
appeared in the political arena at this time. 
  We offer for readers' attention the strategy of a way 
out of the crisis formulated by the Organizing Committee of the 
People's Party of the Republic of Tajikistan and the Executive 
Committee of the Tajik Association of Furtherance of the 
Cooperation and Progress of the Peoples of Central Asia (TASS 
PNTsA). 
  This strategy was formulated on the basis of specific 
features based on a scientific historical analysis of all the 
conditions of the real life and a recognition of the cultural, 
national, and historical traditions and customs of the peoples 
of Tajikistan and the use of what is best from the experience of 
the world community. It proceeds from the fact that there are 
real opportunities--the scientific and technological potential, 
the major industrial base, competent personnel--for overcoming 
the crisis in the republic. 
  The Organizing Committee of the People's Party of the 
Republic of Tajikistan and the TASS PNTsA Executive Committee 
believe that it is possible with prudent and professional 
government to considerably replenish the domestic market and 
increase the export potential and that it is still possible to 
halt the outflow of the Russian-speaking population and the 
interconnected processes of the impoverishment of society and 
the decline in production. It is essential to this end to 
undertake in practice economic reforms and privatization in 
order that they serve the emancipation and recovery of the 
economy; to transfer ownership, of the land included, to those 
who are capable by honest labor and economic enterprise of 
enriching society and themselves; by means of economic, 
political, ideological, law enforcement, and all other measures 
permitted by law to eliminate the omnipotence of bureaucratism 
in the organs of power and administration and to put a stop to 
the orgy of crime and corruption; to ensure glasnost for 
decision-making on questions of the formation of the Armed 
Forces, the National Guard, the National Security Service, and 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and also of the use of 
material resources; to actively contribute to the preservation 
and strengthening of the all-around ties of the Republic of 
Tajikistan to the independent states, which have taken shape 
over many decades, and to the establishment of equal, mutually 
beneficial relations with countries of all continents. 
  The denationalization of property and privatization could 
serve to revitalize production, preserve the existing and create 
new jobs, lift the restrictions on the growth of wages, and 
realize the right of the participants in the economic process to 
the results of their labor. 
  The first step on a way out of the crisis should be the 
restoration both of the intrarepublic market and the common 
economic space. All production and service structures may 
function normally only with mutually acceptable agreements on 
prices and tariffs providing for guarantees of their fulfillment 
and penalties for those who violate them. Everyone should grasp 
the obvious fact here that for a way out of the crisis and the 
all-around recovery of production, the imposition of world 
prices on the domestic market would be the final blow to the 
economy and the reduction of the population to total poverty. 
  The organs of power and administration must draw up and 
implement specific (in terms of sector and time frame) and 
long-term programs of the enlistment of producers in the market 
economy. Required for this are the reorientation of the 
production structures and the infrastructure connected with them 
toward commercial success, consideration of the requirements of 
the consumer, an expansion of the market, the emancipation of 
the distribution mechanism, advisory and research services and 
technical assistance, long-term bank loans on justified terms, 
and the introduction of the progressive taxation of profits from 
the products of monopoly enterprises, for which free prices are 
established, and also a system of taxation that does not fetter 
enterprise. State support for small and medium-sized business 
and the development of new forms of ownership in the countryside 
are needed likewise. 
  On the whole, it is impossible to accomplish the economic 
tasks without a solicitous attitude toward the production 
potential created by many generations. It is essential to this 
end to restore to an economically and socially justified level 
the working capital of the state-owned enterprises, which has 
been reduced in recent years; establish maximum prices of energy 
and products of the structure-forming sectors; determine the 
criteria and procedure of the computation of production costs; 
put an end to the flawed practice of the establishment of "free 
prices" of products in short supply, imported products included, 
merely with regard to the growing demand for them, but without 
consideration of their prime costs and transport and 
merchandising outlays. 
  The program of enterprise privatization should provide for 
the competition of privatization scenarios (projects), including 
guarantees of an increase in product competitiveness, and 
conditions of the employment and remuneration of the work force. 
Employees who have actively contributed to its privatization may 
enjoy preferential terms for the purchase of stock. And the 
enterprises should be authorized to sell their products 
themselves, bypassing the commodity markets. 
  With any diversity of forms of ownership in the Republic of 
Tajikistan, the land, water, major hydraulic engineering works, 
mineral resources, and enterprises of defense significance shall 
for the transitional period be property of the state. The 
highest representative body--the Supreme Council--should ensure 
the firmness of the proposition that no law may be adopted and 
no tax may be imposed without its consent. 
  Evaluating the present position of the unions of the 
republic, we believe that they are failing to display due 
persistence and scrupulousness in the defense of the interests 
of the working people and the unemployed, and in assuring high 
employment and higher pay, with regard to the galloping rate of 
price rises for consumer goods and services, and also on matters 
of an improvement in work conditions. The traditional collective 
contracts between the employers and the unions have become an 
empty formality. A reform of the unions would be expedient under 
these conditions. 
  Structural policy, whose purpose is the development of the 
consumer sector and an increase in export potential, should be 
flexible and "sparing" in order to preserve the structures whose 
elimination or reduction would cause a sharp increase in 
unemployment. Power engineering and the branches of the economy 
without which effective structural changes are impossible 
require serious government support. Investments here should be 
tax-exempt, and the public sector should for the transitional 
period be determined as a percentage. 
  Agrarian policy is determining in the surmounting of the 
food 
and raw material crisis, in an improvement in society's dietary 
ration and the environmental situation, and in the recuperation 
of the social position of the countryside. A diversity of forms 
of land ownership should be established in the countryside to 
ensure that agrarian policy really serves these goals. It is 
essential to free the high-income kolkhozes and sovkhozes from 
administrative-economic interference, and they should be 
reorganized only in accordance with the wishes of the employees, 
farmers, and other structures. 
  It would be expedient to submit for public consideration the 
question of the differentiated (in terms of the natural and 
climatic zones of the republic) transfer of the land to the 
peasants, but without the right to purchase or sell it for 20-25 
years. The state is called upon to ensure the parity of the 
price of food and agricultural raw material on the one hand, and 
goods for the inhabitants of the countryside and agricultural 
production on the other. 
  The social policy of the transition to a market economy 
should prompt the citizens to socioeconomic activity, preventing 
the formation of dependent sentiments among the able-bodied part 
of the populace. 
  A system of material and spiritual support for those who 
objectively are incapable of ensuring by their own labor 
satisfaction of a minimum of consumption and cultural 
requirements should be created in the republic. 
  Henceforward, until the economy has recovered and the social 
position of the populace has strengthened, the state is required 
to regularly (not less than quarterly) index wages, pensions, 
allowances, lump-sum payments, and grants and the public's 
savings bank deposits. 
  Pensions should be paid on the basis of fair 
differentiation--with regard not simply to length of service but 
also to previous labor contribution and services to society and 
the republic. Mother and child, particularly in environmentally 
unfortunate areas, are in need of serious social protection. The 
economic costs of the transitional period and the manifestly 
insufficient attention of the state authorities have 
predetermined the extremely calamitous position of institutions 
of public education, health care, and research. 
  We consider urgent an increase in government appropriations 
to these spheres, thanks to a reduction in the swollen 
administrative machinery of the organs of power and 
administration and thousands of contrived positions in the 
national economy included. A society in which institutions of 
public education, health care, research, and culture and their 
employees are tied to the residual principle of distribution 
cannot be morally healthy. 
  Employment policy, being geared not only to a solution of 
problems of the training, retraining, and improvement of the 
employees and jobs for the able-bodied part of the population 
which is not in work, should serve as a factor of the relaxation 
of social tension, a reduction in the level of crime, and a 
strengthening of public morals. For this reason, it is essential 
together with the measures that are being implemented currently 
for the creation of jobs in the republic to legislatively offer 
the enterprises the opportunity to provide with jobs young 
people, mothers, the handicapped, and retirees who did not work 
earlier. The resources allocated for social programs shall be 
tax-exempt. 
  Inasmuch as, by virtue of a number of factors, the problem 
of 
jobs for all the unemployed cannot be resolved in the republic 
itself, the Republic of Tajikistan should acquire the status of 
a developing state. This would give the unemployed the right of 
travel from the republic (on a contract basis for work in 
foreign countries, with their remuneration by international 
standards). 
  Foreign economic policy should serve as an appreciable 
support in the recovery of the economy and the social sphere of 
Tajikistan. But foreign economic relations should not be of any 
ideological focus here. 
  It is expedient to undertake national-state building in 
multinational Tajikistan on the basis of a balance of the real 
interests of the republic and the oblasts of Tajikistan. 
  We support a clear separation of the legislative, executive, 
and judicial authorities, with the unconditional supremacy of 
the law. We believe together with this that realization of the 
commonly accepted right of the peoples to self-determination 
should not conflict with civil rights or stimulate trends toward 
national-state exclusiveness or a one-sided orientation in 
foreign policy and a weakening and severance of economic and 
spiritual ties to the states that are members of the CIS. 
  The spiritual potential and cultural wealth of the Republic 
of Tajikistan are of world significance and an integral part of 
general civilization. But Tajikistan's integration in the world 
civilization process is impossible without the imperative of 
social reforms in the sphere of education, science, culture, and 
health care. The state is required to materially support the 
employees of these spheres and the scientific-pedagogical and 
artistic intelligentsia in their struggle against the onerous 
and humiliating consequences of the economic crisis and the 
uncontrolled transition to market relations and adopt effective 
measures to stabilize the situation and consolidate all 
political parties and public organizations of the republic and 
adopt constructive measures that will contribute to the 
speediest development and formation of a democratic secular 
state.

<F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Starukhin, </F>
special for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Tickets to Satiety: On the 
Distribution-by-Coupon System in Voronezh Oblast"] 
  [Text] Voronezh--As usual, the doorbell rang in the 
evening: "Here are your coupons for this month." And now I hold 
in my hand pale-green chits: "Margarine products--250 g, 
vegetable oil--9.5 kg, sugar 1 kg, eggs--10." 
  Thank you! Thank who? Naturally, the Voronezh Oblast 
administration. Just now I was sitting in front of the TV, 
absorbing the program, "The Executive Branch Hour," which, 
following an established pattern, once again featured the 
oblast's governor, Aleksandr Yakovlevich Kovalev. A considerable 
part of these communications, which as a rule are broadcast 
live, deals with food prices. The substance of exhortations from 
the screen: We are trying to contain price rises; we cover a lot 
by subsidies; we will not let anyone live in poverty, and our 
Voronezh Oblast always has and will look probably better against 
other regions in Russia. 
  These days, populism is a word that is somewhat insulting to 
those at whom it is directed. For what is meant in this instance 
is a simplistic game with the popular masses. But let us go back 
to the freshly issued coupons. For the so-called "margarine 
products," whether sold with or without coupons, the price 
differential is negligible. Especially considering that it is 
usually not sold for these coupons. "Vegetable oil"--these 
coupons have sat like especially valuable securities in a vase 
since who knows which month. They have not been used, for the 
simple reason that it is unknown who sells this substance in 
exchange for chits printed in a printing house, and when and 
where that might be. Finally, "sugar" coupons are total 
nonsense: it costs 570 rubles [R] a kilogram with the coupon, 
and R520, or sometimes even R500, without it. 
  The system of ration cards or coupons works with a market 
only at its initial stage, when there are still not enough basic 
necessities for everyone. What is happening in this particular 
case, however? Oblast warehouses are overflowing with sugar. We 
talk to Viktor Kodentsev, the director of Yevdakovskiy fats and 
oils combine: this major enterprise is ready to ship margarine 
and vegetable oils to America if necessary. By railcar, by the 
trainload. Or perhaps hens no longer lay eggs?--not at all; 
while in some places agricultural output has declined, Voronezh 
poultry breeding is on the rise. 
  Until recently, vodka also was sold for coupons--but the 
local liquor industry cannot find enough of a distribution 
market, and for this reason is holding back the production line. 
The root of the problem is prices. Somehow, foodstuffs 
production cost is very high, and the producers present a 
critical price ultimatum, which the buyer is unable to accept. 
What to do--wait for the desired market self-regulation? In 
Voronezh, they do it differently: they ban selling the products 
outside of the oblast. There have been long, heated arguments 
regarding the expediency, and most importantly, the legality of 
this decision between the oblast administration and its 
opponents, the product owners. Naturally, the strongest one 
wins. There are bans whichever way you turn; the roads are 
littered with checkpoints. 
  At one of the largest consumer cooperatives' food processing 
complexes in Russia, which is located on the outskirts of 
Voronezh, I was told a bitter tale: they have to curtail 
production of sausage because their own cities and settlements 
have an adequate supply, and to sell it outside--to the 
northern, solidly industrial regions--is strictly forbidden. 
Another lament worthy of sympathy: guest workers from the very 
near abroad came to Voronezh villages to earn money; they worked 
hard, and were paid in kind, that is, in potatoes, but those at 
the top forbade taking the potatoes out. And honest workers had 
been sitting on their sacks until mid-winter. 
  What has the distribution-by-coupon and simultaneously 
proscriptive system produced? Reports are coming from the 
extensive network of checkpoints about detaining transports with 
eggs, flour, margarine, and butter. Is the system working? 
  I go to Voronezh's central market and join a line for cheap 
flour; my neighbors run to a truck from which someone is selling 
unexpectedly affordable sugar. Where are the goodies from? 
From.... Volgograd! Does this make sense? Gasoline alone costs a 
fortune! "It pays," they reply. The populist myth that Voronezh 
foodstuffs are the cheapest of them all develops a perceptible 
crack in the eyes of the public at the market, in whose pockets 
there are more coupons than money. And on top of that, Central 
Television reports sternly impartial statistics: the most 
expensive eggs in Russia are in the Central Chernozem region; 
neither are prices for other foodstuffs quite affordable, while 
average wages of, for instance, Voronezh residents are close to 
the bottom. The myth, alas, explodes. 
  So what is it--are the actions of the oblast leadership in 
this direction completely void of good intentions? On the 
contrary, they ooze with the most sincere concern for the 
people. What is questionable is something else: Is the intensive 
shifting of levers of the old machinery, familiar to everyone, 
constructive? At all times, bans and leveling-type distribution 
did not require especial economic acumen, a deep analysis of the 
state of affairs, or, finally, honest and careful control over 
production and price formation. Are the lamentations of goods 
producers always justified when they point out their superhigh 
production cost and thus justify "biting" prices? And what goes 
into this production cost? Are increasingly new taxes--both 
federal and local--justified if they are becoming a noose around 
the neck of food processing and other enterprises? Why only in 
Russia, and not at the best time of its life at that (are we 
again ahead of the entire planet?), and in particular in 
Voronezh Oblast salaries of high officials can be simply 
mind-boggling, not subject to any control or restrictions, and 
exceed labor remuneration of lower-ranking "ordinary consumers" 
by a factor of 26 (according to the same statistics)? To solve 
at least these problems, one has to work assiduously and think 
things through. 
  Until then, they keep ringing my doorbell. Handing out 
coupons.

"An Attempt To Expel the Chairman of the Free Trade Unions 
Central Committee From Russia: Vladimir Klebanov Escapes 
Detention"] 
  [Text] Russian trade unions have issued an appeal to Moscow 
Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and Vladimir Yerin, Russian Federation 
minister of internal affairs, expressing "serious concern 
regarding the arbitrariness" of actions with respect to Vladimir 
Klebanov, chairman of one of the largest trade union 
associations--which has grassroots organizations in all sectors 
of national economy--the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions, 
and member of the Constitutional Conference. As follows from the 
appeal, on 10 January Vladimir Klebanov was detained by officers 
of the 58th militia precinct in the apartment where he lived 
(which also houses the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions 
headquarters) for violating the capital city mayor's directive 
on visa regulations: Klebanov did not have a residence permit. 
  According to eyewitness Tatyana Sevryukova, the arrest was 
conducted rudely. Vladimir Klebanov was yelled at and not 
permitted to use the telephone; after being brought to the 
precinct he was put in a preliminary detention cell along with 
criminals. Tatyana Sevryukova also reported that currently 
Vladimir Klebanov is not in possession of his passport, since 
back in August officers of the same precinct confiscated this 
document for living in the city without a residence permit and 
still have not returned it. Therefore the trade union leader, 
much as he would not want to, could not avoid violating the visa 
regulations. 
  Nikolay Klimov, passport desk chief at the 58th militia 
precinct, confirmed that the trade union leader "was kept for 
some time in the preliminary detention cell," from where he was 
sent to the city reception center. "I do not know what happened 
to him after that," said Mr. Klimov. As it turned out, the staff 
at the reception center also remembers Vladimir Klebanov. "The 
point is that Mr. Klebanov, member of the Constitutional 
Conference and chairman of the Central Committee of Free Trade 
Unions, does not have a job, is not engaged in socially useful 
activities, does not have a passport in his possession, and 
therefore is no different from any vagrant. And since he was not 
born in Russia, the decision was made to expel him from the 
country," said a ranking staff member at the reception center. 
True, in the process, in his words, "the expulsion instruction 
was not carried out exactly." Instead of delivering Mr. Klebanov 
to Belarus, where he was born (although he does not have either 
citizenship or a residence permit there), he was sent to 
Ukraine. Whether he was actually delivered there, the reception 
center staff does not know. 
  According to Free Trade Unions, however, Vladimir Klebanov 
"escaped his escort during deportation." According to the 
statement of Eduard Baykov, member of the Central Committee of 
Free Trade Unions, Vladimir Klebanov, a noted human rights 
activist and former prisoner of the Soviet GULAG, experienced in 
underground work, was able to outwit his escort and once again 
set himself free. The trade union leader is currently living 
covertly in Moscow. It is not safe for him, however. At any time 
there may be another attempt to grab Vladimir Klebanov and try 
to deport him again. 
  In this connection a number of Russian trade unions issued 
an 
official statement that Vladimir Klebanov is a noted human 
rights activist of the "stagnation" era and the organizer of the 
first free and completely independent trade union structures in 
the USSR, for which he was persecuted at the time. He has now 
been completely exonerated. Persecution, however, continues, as 
we can all see. This fact, the statement emphasizes, is not only 
alarming but also an outrage. Especially considering that the 
recently adopted Constitution proclaims broader than ever human 
rights. 
  Russian trade unions demand that Vladimir Klebanov be 
granted 
"the legitimate right to carry out his public duties." Trade 
union leaders expect the mayoralty and the Russian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs to conduct a principled appraisal of the 
incident. And at the same time guarantee to Mr. Klebanov, who 
has been elected to his position by members of Free Trade 
Unions, complete safety from a repetition of such arbitrariness 
and finally resolve the issue of his residence permit.

"Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia Fights Against 
U.S. Influence--and Defines Social Utility of a Individual"] 
  [Text] The central coordinating council of the Federation 
of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR] adopted a decision 
"to boycott the Association of Independent Trade Unions of 
Russia and its foreign `coaches' represented by American AFL-CIO 
trade unions." The reason, as the FITUR statement said, is that 
"lately the American AFL-CIO representation in Russia has been 
increasingly intensifying its fight against the independent 
trade unions of Russia with the purpose of destroying those 
trade unions that take a position of independence and defend 
both the interests of the workers and the national interests of 
the country." In the process, in the opinion of federation 
members, the American trade unions' representation is 
"searching" for those among the Russian trade union leaders who 
"can be bought for dollars," artificially creating "shell" trade 
union organizations that could feed on the difficulties of the 
stage of formation of the independent trade union movement. In 
the opinion of the statement's authors, "the role of the 
so-called Association of Independent Trade Unions of 
Russia"--recently created within the framework of the 
Russian-American Foundation for Trade Union Research and 
Education and financed by the U.S. Congress--"is precisely 
this--to imitate such `trade union' activities whereby the 
workers, instead of fighting for their rights, would blindly 
follow the American policy course in our country." 
  In this connection the leadership of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia asserted that the actions of 
the American AFL-CIO representation in Moscow "are aimed at 
undermining the national interests of Russia." 
  As Aleksandr Alekseyev, FITUR chairman, told the SEGODNYA 
correspondent, the central coordinating council of his 
federation currently has information regarding "several Russian 
trade union leaders already having been bought by Americans." 
This, in turn, in Aleksandr Alekseyev's opinion, will lead in 
the near future to a situation whereby the activities of a 
number of Russian trade union organizations may end up "under 
U.S. control." 
  In this situation, FITUR--one of the major trade union 
associations which includes representatives of metallurgical, 
oil, and machine-building industries, pilots and military 
servicemen, among others--intends to take response measures. 
Among them is creating on the basis of their trade unions the 
National Labor Party, which was registered several days ago with 
the Ministry of Justice. "We have one goal--to strive for the 
maximum participation of workers in the political life of the 
country for the purpose of building a `socially-oriented 
state,'" said Mr. Alekseyev. According to him, members of the 
party will act on the assumption that the basis of any state is 
labor; labor is the primary source of human rights and defines 
an individual's social freedom. Thus, in Mr. Alekseyev's 
opinion, labor for the good of the nation should become a social 
obligation of any citizen and the only criterion for determining 
social utility both of an individual and of various social 
groups.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Sinitskiy under rubric "Plans of Russian </F>
Companies for 1994": "Rostelekom Receives Ministry of 
Communications License"] 
  [Text] 
  [begin boxed item] The history of the Rostelekom [Russian 
Telecommunications] open-type joint-stock company began with the 
first Soviet joint-stock company Sovtelekom, which was 
established in June 1990. Its main function was to coordinate 
the activity of the Ministries of Communications of the Union 
republics in the sphere of organization of intercity and 
international communications. After the breakup of the USSR, 
Sovtelekom was reorganized into Intertelekom, whose founders 
remained the Ministries of Communications of the CIS countries. 
However, Intertelekom did not last long--until the Minsk 
conference of the heads of state of the CIS in December 1993. 
The reason for its "demise" was the registration in September of 
that same year of the joint-stock company Rostelekom, which the 
Russian part of Intertelekom joined. In the words of Mr. Belov, 
general director of the Rostelekom joint-stock company, the 
three stages of the development of the company personify the old 
Russian saying: "The first son is for God, the second is for the 
Tsar, but the third is for my support." [end boxed item] 
  Yesterday in Moscow's President Hotel, Vladimir Bulgak, 
minister of communications of the Russian Federation, awarded 
the Rostelekom joint-stock company a license to provide 
intercity and international communications services on the 
territory of Russia. The baptism of the new enterprise, which 
was registered in September of last year, was held in the 
Uspenskaya Church of the Novodevichiy Monastery. Rostelekom 
acquired priority right to the development of a digital 
communications system in Russia. 
  In the words of Mr. Bulgak, the Ministry of Communications 
preferred the Western path of development of the industry, in 
which all the company operators that provide communications 
services function on a commercial basis, and the ministry 
retains for itself only regulatory functions. About 20 
international operators are now functioning in Russia. In 
addition, Rostelekom enjoys the obvious preference of the 
Ministry of Communications. As Mr. Bulgak declared, "all flowers 
should grow, but Rostelekom will be the main bunch of flowers in 
the flower bed planted by the ministry." Thus, given sensible 
protectionism on the part of the Ministry of Communications, 
great prospects obviously await it. 
  It would be possible to bring the Russian communications 
system up to the world level by means of a gradual replacement 
of the existing analog network by a modern digital network; 
however, in the words of Mr. Bulgak, the construction of a 
parallel digital network will be cheaper by a factor of four to 
five. In the first stage of the creation of a modern Russian 
digital system of international communications, Rostelekom in 
April 1993 built its western Moscow-St. Petersburg-Copenhagen 
sector. As Rostelekom's General Director Oleg Belov reported, 
the joint-stock company is now performing work on the eastern 
and southern sectors of this system. To complete the eastern 
project by the end of 1994, which includes the construction of a 
Russia-Japan-Korea submarine fiber-optic cable line, a main 
Nakhodka-Khabarovsk line, and an international telephone station 
in Khabarovsk will require more than $50 million and 30 billion 
rubles [R]. The southern project will connect the fiber-optic 
lines of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Italy (the volume of 
investments will total about $50 million and R70 billion). The 
establishment of the Moscow-Khabarovsk digital line will unite 
the western, eastern, and southern sectors, and will guarantee 
the receipt of income from the international traffic between 
Europe and Asia. The construction of this line will cost $220 
million and R125 billion. It is planned to complete all projects 
in 1996. In addition, for the general "digitization" of Russia, 
the Rostelekom joint-stock company plans to build 50 new 
international stations and 50,000 kilometers of digital 
fiber-optic and radio relay lines starting in 1995. This 
project, which has been given the name "50 x 50" is calculated 
for 10 years and will require $15 billion and no less an amount 
of rubles. In the words of Mr. Bulgak, the joint-stock company 
is the structure that is capable of attracting such resources, 
inasmuch as no one will invest in a state company other than, 
perhaps, the government. 
  After the presentation in the President Hotel, its 
participants (including guests from 27 foreign firms) set off 
for Uspenskaya Church where a church service was held in honor 
of Rostelekom's being granted a license. It is possible that 
this is tied in with the date of the event--13 January--although 
the license itself absolutely fortuitously has the lucky number 
777.

Yelena Razgon, members of the Central Scientific-Research 
Institute for Nonferrous Metallurgy Economics and Information: 
"Priorities in Nonferrous Metallurgy"] 
  [Text] Moscow--Development of domestic nonferrous 
metallurgy will be defined by the Federal Program of Technical 
Modernization and Development of Russian Metallurgy. This will 
require money. And a lot of it. 
  The share of capital investment in Russian nonferrous 
metallurgy comprises about 4 percent of the total investment in 
industry, while the proportional capital intensity of producing 
a tonne of various metals fluctuates between 800,000 and 1.2 
million rubles [R]. This is greater than the same value abroad, 
because we use poorer raw materials, place enterprises in 
undeveloped regions with difficult access, and so on. Besides, 
nonferrous metallurgy (especially its ore base) also is a 
high-inertia sector, where the investment cycle stretches up to 
16 years (up to 10 years abroad). 
  The need to develop nonferrous metallurgy under the 
extremely 
difficult conditions of a transition to market relations assumes 
the following investment policy priorities (see diagram) 
[diagram not reproduced]: 
  --increasing investment in the development of the raw 
material base, including greater investment in nonferrous 
metallurgy reprocessing, since scrap and waste are important 
components of the raw material balance; 
  --increasing the share of new construction in the total 
volume of investment; 
  --increasing investment in the development of nonferrous 
metallurgy in the Far North, Siberian, and Urals regions; 
  --stabilizing the share of investment (at the level of at 
least 50 percent) for reconstruction and technical modernization 
of nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, while at the same time 
increasing the share of capital investment going into creating 
competitive products and increasing the environmental safety of 
production. 
  The chronic shortage of capital investment in the 
development 
of nonferrous metallurgy over the past 10 years and the 
diminished share of investment into the raw material base (from 
40-45 percent in the 1970's to 35 percent in the beginning of 
1990's) have brought this base into a critical condition. 
Development of new deposits is being delayed; anticipatory 
construction has been sharply curtailed; construction in 
progress has been suspended on number of objects. 
  Taking into account the raw material orientation of 
nonferrous metallurgy, for which the strengthening of the ore 
base is possible mainly through construction of new mining and 
processing enterprises (frequently based on mineral deposits 
located in sparsely populated areas of Siberia and the Far 
East), the share of the raw material component in the total 
investment must be increased to 45-50 percent. The Federal 
Program of Development of the Raw Material Base for Nonferrous 
Metallurgy for 1993-1995 envisaged investing R4.9 billion (in 
1991 prices) in the development of priority objects of the ore 
base. 
  The disintegration of the USSR, which has led to a 
disruption 
of production ties in nonferrous metallurgy, has created extreme 
difficulties in keeping many Russian metallurgical enterprises 
supplied with raw materials that were traditionally mined in 
other republics of the former Union. This requires new 
construction of not only mining but also of some metallurgical 
capacities in order to organize production of items whose 
manufacture in Russia had been limited. 
  Reconstruction and technical modernization of enterprises 
along the entire production chain in nonferrous metallurgy and 
reduction of ecological hazards of this production remain an 
important direction of investment policy. The share of this part 
in the total investment must be preserved at the level of 52 
percent. 
  It is envisaged that the bulk of capital investment (more 
than 70 percent) is to be used in the base raw material 
subsectors--aluminum, copper, lead and zinc, and tungsten and 
molybdenum. This reflects the existing ratios of industrial 
construction and is necessitated both by the large scale of 
these productions and by their high efficiency, as well as the 
fact that these subsectors' enterprises (especially mining) are 
located predominantly in regions that have difficult access and 
are not well developed, and where capital intensity of 
production is 2.5-3.5 times higher than that in the European 
part of Russia. 
  Implementation of the measures envisaged by the draft 
Federal 
Program of Technical Modernization and Development of Russian 
Metallurgy (1993-2000) will require capital investment in the 
amount of R14.9518 billion (in 1991 prices) and $3.2052 billion 
(see diagram) [diagram not reproduced]. 
  It is envisaged that investment will come from enterprises 
(stockholders), private capital, budget financing, and foreign 
capital. 
  In carrying out the privatization program, capital from 
issuing stock should become the main source of financing. A 
potential volume of investment from this source is estimated at 
the level of 30-33 percent of the total volume of investment in 
1993-1995. In the future, as more nonferrous metallurgy 
enterprises are denationalized, the share of stockholder capital 
may increase to 60-70 percent. 
  The sphere that may attract private capital, which should 
account for 3-5 percent, includes nonferrous metallurgy 
reprocessing, certain metalworking productions, and development 
of rich mineral deposits with insignificant content of ores. 
  Investment from attracting foreign investors money and 
creating on this basis transnational-type companies is estimated 
to account for 5 percent. 
  It should be emphasized that development of such a sector as 
nonferrous metallurgy, which operates in objectively difficult 
conditions necessitated by proximity to natural resources, 
cannot and should not evolve without state protectionism--budget 
financing. The share of state money in the investment in 
nonferrous metallurgy development is envisaged at the level of 
25-27 percent, which corresponds to foreign practices where 
state subsidies comprise about 25 percent of the total 
investment volume. 
  Implementation of measures envisaged in the federal program 
will ensure a more balanced and effective development of 
nonferrous metallurgy as a whole, liquidating disproportion 
between the main segments of the production chain, progressive 
changes in terms of enterprise location and product 
nomenclature, less dependence on importing raw materials and 
components, and increased effectiveness in export operations. It 
is expected that annual savings by the year 2000 will amount to 
more than R890 billion, including R270 billion from setting up 
production that will replace imports, and about R60 billion from 
increased effectiveness of imports. A return on capital 
investment is expected in seven years.

<F P=106> [Report of Viktor Gritsayev, deputy chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones, at 
all-Russia conference of managers of gold-mining enterprises, 
under the general heading: "Gold Mining: An Inside View": "It Is 
Not Easy To Resolve the Industry's Problems"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, an all-Russia 
conference of managers of gold-mining enterprises took place 
16-17 December 1993. The conference discussed in detail the 
results of the sector's operations in 1993 and the problems 
gold-mining enterprises are encountering. Today we are 
publishing materials from this conference. 
  "The sector has fulfilled the 1993 plan"--with these 
words Viktor Gritsayev, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones, 
began his report, a rendition of which is published below. 
  Quoting a number of figures on various aspects of gold 
production, he noted that in the current difficult conditions 
many regions have increased production of the precious metal. 
Among them are first and foremost Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk 
Krays, Irkutsk and Amur Oblasts, and the Evenk Republic. 
  At the same time, there are many problems interfering with 
the operations of gold-mining enterprises and gold-prospecting 
cooperatives. The sector has shifted to transactions at world 
prices. This improved the economic situation of enterprises in 
the first half of the year somewhat. However, in the second half 
of 1993 inflation caused a sharp rise in prices for fuel, food, 
and material and technical resources, and put gold-mining 
enterprises in a difficult situation. This was exacerbated by 
the introduction of a score of taxes and levies, totalling 30-40 
percent of the value of gold produced. Investment in 
reconstruction of existing and construction of new enterprises 
was curtailed sharply, and material and technical supply 
worsened, especially in the Far North regions. 
  The fact that the existing structure of associations has 
been 
destroyed and settlements were left without financial support 
had a serious impact on the work of gold prospectors. Most of 
the skilled cadres are leaving the Far North regions. 
  It was pointed out in the report that the decision to 
transfer gold-mining industry enterprises to the jurisdiction of 
the Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones was made by the government in May of this year, but the 
sector is still being managed by a number of ministries and 
agencies. For instance, the raw materials base is under the 
jurisdiction of the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources and local 
administrations; property relations and structural 
transformations are the prerogative of the Russian Federation 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property; credits 
are the sphere of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry 
of Finance. Price formation and receipt of the final products 
are the competence of the Russian Federation Committee on 
Precious Metals and Precious Stones together with the Ministry 
of Finance and the Russian Federation Committee on Price Policy. 
  The first six months of work in the new conditions showed 
that despite all the difficulties, the gold-mining enterprises 
have not reduced production of the precious metal and a certain 
foundation has been laid for normal work in 1994. 
  Noting the positive points, the speaker nevertheless dwelled 
on the shortcomings in special detail. 
  Construction of enterprises on the new Sukhoy Log mineral 
deposit is proceeding at a very slow pace. 
  With respect to the level of technologies used, the 
gold-mining industry has been and remains among the best in the 
world so far, the speaker said. Without purchasing a single 
license, we possess a modern system of resource-saving. Our new 
enterprises over the past 10 years have been designed and built 
on the basis of tested scientific development. Unfortunately, 
because centralized financing has dried up, science services in 
the sectors have deteriorated dramatically. Especially with 
respect to finding solutions to major scientific and technical 
problems. Work has been practically suspended on improving the 
existing and creating new, more efficient domestic equipment. 
  Even the largest enterprises cannot support new research on 
their own. We will be able to handle it only if we combine our 
resources. 
  The president and the government of Russia, the speaker 
said, 
have made a decision to set up a nonbudget fund to finance 
scientific-technical and R&amp;D work in the sector. This 
decision 
was in effect in 1993, and we asked the government to extend it 
to 1994. I want everybody present to understand that all of us 
need it, said Viktor Gritsayev. 
  He expressed particular concern over the curtailment of 
geological prospecting work. In 1993, the report said, the 
Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of 
Mineral Resources allocated us 9 billion rubles [R] for this 
purpose instead of the R130 billion it was supposed to allocate 
on the basis of the volume of commercial product produced in the 
sector. The figures are incommensurate. 
  What awaits the sector in the future? In 1990, said the 
speaker, the Main Administration for Diamonds and Gold, with the 
participation of a broad range of scientific organizations and 
representatives of the territories, developed a concept for the 
development of the gold-mining industry to the year 2010. For 
well-known reasons its implementation has been curtailed since 
1992. Today, in order to implement this program, we need to 
invest at least R140 billion annually. Quite clearly, 
enterprises do not have such money, and the budget cannot issue 
such credit. Therefore, the task for the sector is to attract 
domestic and foreign investors. The Russian Federation Committee 
on Precious Metals and Precious Stones is developing a 
gold-mining program for 1994-1995 and up to the year 2000 in the 
new environment. 
  In conclusion, the speaker said that at a conference 
organized by the Central Council of the Trade Union of the 
Russian Federation Mining and Metallurgical Industry Workers on 
28 November, the question of establishing in the sector honorary 
titles and awards for many years of unblemished work and 
considerable contribution to the development of the gold-mining 
industry was brought up with some urgency. 
  The Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and 
Precious Stones and the Russian Ministry of Labor have been 
instructed to prepare appropriate proposals on this subject. 
Meanwhile, today, said Viktor Gritsayev, on behalf of the 
collegium I would like to thank all those who worked 
conscientiously in 1993 and wish them success in the year to 
come.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasiliy Stekolnikov, chief designer of </F>
Russia's nuclear reactors, by Vladimir Gubarev; place and date 
not given: "A Nuclear Island"] 
  [Text] Nekos Studio. Chief Designer of Reactors, 
Vasiliy Stekolnikov, on the past, present, and future of 
Russia's nuclear power plants. 
  Vasiliy Vasilyevich granted only one interview in his 
life and that was in America. When he arrived, the chief 
designer, naturally, was at the center of the attention not only 
of his colleagues but also of newspapermen. One of them managed 
to "get Stekolnikov talking." The interview was published the 
next day and, much to Stekolnikov's surprise, he read in it 
things he had not said! That is when he made a pledge: "No 
interviews!" And since Vasiliy Vasilyevich is an acerbic person 
and does not mince words, he added a couple of "strong 
expressions" and since that time has had no contact with 
journalists. 
  Our relations with him were different. We have visited 
the nuclear power plants several times and attended various 
conferences together and we have discussed the vicissitudes of 
life over a glass of vodka. But I never once asked him for an 
interview, and ultimately Stekolnikov could not help asking: 
"Why not?" I admitted honestly: I do not want to spoil our good 
relationship. He hemmed and hawed a while and never returned to 
the "problem of the interview." 
  But this was the anniversary of Atomenergoremont--an 
organization that does perhaps the most difficult and dangerous 
work at nuclear power plants. So it turned out that we spent a 
good deal of time together. And ultimately Vasiliy Vasilyevich 
"waxed generous": He agreed to speak frankly about the problems 
related to nuclear energy engineering and his work in it. 
  [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, who are you? 
  [Stekolnikov] An interesting question...but I myself do not 
know: perhaps a Russian, perhaps Veps...those who were not 
conquered by Genghis Khan. My ancestors are from around Pskov, 
areas that have always been considered "Russian land from time 
immemorial"; that is where our village is. I was unable to go 
there for a long time--I did not have the time, and then when I 
managed to get to these parts--there are most beautiful 
landscapes...but that does not interest you and so I will give 
you a straightforward answer: Since 1962 I have been the chief 
designer of Gidropress and director at the same time. Over 25 
years we have created it with our own hands and that is why the 
firm now looks extremely representative--there are only 48,000 
square meters of production area, 19 buildings with 100 
apartments each, two kindergartens...We did some real work! 
  [Gubarev] A strange name, Gidropress.... 
  [Stekolnikov] It is arbitrary...or rather--secret. Which we 
have been since 1946 when we began to work on reactors. Speaking 
of the "bare essentials," not including trifles, it is a number 
of research reactors, the first steam generator in the world, we 
make steam generators for Siberian combines--in Krasnoyarsk and 
Tomsk, and then VVER's [water-moderated power reactors], 
particularly 35 "440's," 19 "millions," and modifications of 
reactors for submarines. The Americans called them "alpha," and 
a turmoil even began in their Congress at that time: Why have 
the Russians gotten ahead of us? Incidentally, for these 
reactors I was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor. 
  [Gubarev] It is strange that for military reactors you are 
designated a Hero, but not for VVER's. 
  [Stekolnikov] I was a prize winner...Gidropress was the 
first 
circuit, that is, a "nuclear island." We are in charge here. In 
general we work where there is radioactivity, and we are not 
interested in places where there is none...other people are in 
charge there. 
  [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, how did you become chief 
designer? Did you start from "scratch".... 
  [Stekolnikov] I graduated from the tekhnikum in Kaliningrad. 
I had always been interested in diesel engines and steam 
engines. But I went into power machine building, to the boiler 
department for another reason: the stipend there was larger and 
by that time I was alone--both my mother and father were dead. 
So in terms of my higher education I am a boiler worker. I was a 
fairly good student and almost graduated with distinction. 
  After the institute we were sent to Nefteapparatur. We were 
not asked--at that time they needed fuel for jet aircraft. That 
was in Podolsk. We began to draw up blueprints. And my friends 
became section chiefs, things turned out very well! We received 
excellent training...and the first thing they said was: "Forget 
about what you have learned before! You have a head on your 
shoulders--so use it!" In the section we graduated from two 
universities--no, I am exaggerating! 
  In November 1954 after two months of testing I was 
transferred to Gidropress although, true, at that time it had no 
name--it was simply an enterprise with a number...and I was 
immediately assigned as a senior engineer. My wages were 
high--180 rubles. For some reason I began to rise rapidly--soon 
I was a section chief. 
  [Gubarev] And what was your first job working with the 
"nuclear subject"? 
  [Stekolnikov] Cooling channels on submarines. If I came up 
with something new I was immediately given a prize. Although, to 
be honest, I was not very interested in this subject 
matter...but at that time there was the concept of "necessity" 
and therefore we did everything that was required of us, the 
more so since I was the chief of the water reactor section and 
the other guys were in charge of ship installations...but 
nonetheless they put me on the ships, and the curious thing is 
that it worked out! At that time I invented a compact apparatus 
which I think is still used to this day...it would be nice to 
know this.... 
  And in general my first design was a column 28 meters high 
weighing about 800 tonnes. It was for petroleum processing. It 
took perseverance to calculate it, the stiffening ring, etc. I 
calculated everything according to the formulas and then I 
looked and saw that something was wrong. I added something of my 
own. And I turned out to be right! No, it was not a matter of 
playing it safe, it was engineering intuition. In our business 
you cannot get by without that. 
  In those days we acted like hooligans. We made a pipe for an 
oil refinery that was 40 meters high. We came up with a new 
"reamer" for it--we saved a great deal of metal. And do you know 
why we did all this? We were not paid very much and from 
efficiency proposals we [passage illegible] very useful in real 
design work--we had no stereotypes in our heads, we were always 
trying to think of something new. As it were, this was training 
for real work. 
  [Gubarev] And this time came? 
  [Stekolnikov] Of course. The atomic submarine. Seventeen 
years of my life. Imagine how many chiefs have come and gone?! 
And difficulties? First vibration, then excessive weight...but 
still we managed! In the Kremlin at a meeting of the 
military-industrial commission when I was asked: "Well, how is 
the ship?" I answered: "It will be done! I believe we will end 
up with a first-class submarine." We achieved it through sweat 
and blood... But when we lowered it, we wept. Not just me--many 
people...perhaps from happiness, perhaps from what we had been 
through, but we wept...snow was falling, it was night--that was 
so the enemies could not locate us!--and we lowered the ship 
into the water and wept because we had devoted some 17 years to 
it. 
  I have never told anyone about that before--even my wife, 
but 
I am telling you so that you will understand how difficult it is 
to get the star of a Hero. It is only fools who can say that 
they give out these stars left and right. Perhaps some people 
have received them without justification, but we designers and 
scientists have earned each one of them with many years of sweat 
and blood, coronaries and pain, sleepless nights and everything 
we have missed out on in life in order to do what was necessary 
for the country and the people. 
  [Gubarev] But why was it so difficult for you to make this 
ship? 
  [Stekolnikov] There was a great deal of competition. 
Dollezhal was working, as were other chief designers. But they 
were already academicians, Heros, and enjoyed a great deal of 
authority. People listened to their opinion, and then here was 
this Stekolnikov...we had to prove that we had come up with 
something better. 
  [Gubarev] Was this something principally new? 
  [Stekolnikov] Of course. Water is one thing, but we had 
something altogether new. This had to do with the compactness of 
the installation, the absence of noise, and a great deal of 
power. A completely different kind of reactor. But the ship was 
"clean"--it could be received in any port. 
  [Gubarev] Were there any accidents? 
  [Stekolnikov] Well, how do you avoid them! But if there was 
an accident one day, the next day I crawled in there myself: I 
wanted to know what happened. But that was possible only in our 
own reactor; you could not get inside anybody else's reactor, 
those of the competitors. We had "alpha" activity; you cover it 
up with a newspaper and it is safe. There was no gamma radiation. 
  [Gubarev] And you were working on civilian reactors more or 
less "as a sideline?" 
  [Stekolnikov] To my "personal account" I credit the boiling 
reactor, BOR-60; done entirely by our department. It ended up a 
compact reactor... submarine [reactor]--order [figure illegible] 
... steam generators for Shevchenko and heat exchangers as 
well... VVER-440, VVER-1000, and some other things. And I am 
proud of all this; after all, it was not in vain that I spent 40 
years in the nuclear industry. 
  [Gubarev] [passage illegible], for example, from the 
automobile? 
  [Stekolnikov] Actually nowhere. Physicists and mechanics 
have 
the same law. The only peculiarity is the nuclear part--residual 
heat release, that is, after the reactor is shut down it 
continues to release a great deal of heat. If an ordinary 
furnace is shut down it becomes cold within an hour or two, but 
a reactor will remain "warm" for another hundred years. The 
residual quantity of energy is extremely great and it must be 
controlled. 
  [Gubarev] I thought you would talk about radiation. 
  [Stekolnikov] Of course the danger of radiation exists. This 
is a reality that must be dealt with and necessarily taken into 
account. But, I repeat, there are laws of physics, and this 
means that we must not fear them but take them into account. 
That is why science exists. And we must create reliable designs. 
  Unfortunately, I have now come to the conclusion that we 
cannot see the degradation of material in time. There is no such 
science. I would call this branch the "life of materials." Why 
does graphite function for only 40 years? It will not work any 
longer than that...in general, materials, like man, get old and 
go out of commission. We live for 70 years, but we will never 
get to 200. Why? There is no answer to this question yet--either 
for man or for material. 
  [Gubarev] You have apparently forgotten about Chernobyl. Is 
this not the main thing in atomic engineering? 
  [Stekolnikov] I am not to blame for Chernobyl...of course 
one 
must look into the causes and effects of the catastrophe, but 
not in the way your fellow journalist sometimes does. Why write 
about a goat with two heads if it was born before Chernobyl?! Or 
about the fact that he, the journalist, is prepared to watch 
television--and this was printed!--in candlelight?! A great 
tragedy occurred in Chernobyl, very great, but we must not 
capitalize on tragedy, we must not! 
  [Gubarev] Those are the consequences...but nonetheless the 
accident occurred, did it not? 
  [Stekolnikov] That is hooliganism...the same thing as riding 
in a car without brakes. You may make it home once, but the next 
time you will definitely get into an accident. Unfortunately, 
nuclear energy workers frequently drove without brakes, hoping 
that everything would turn out all right.... 
  It is clear to me that the people in charge of the reactor 
in 
Chernobyl were at fault. There should be no argument here. But 
the reactor itself, of course, had great shortcomings. It 
accelerated; that is, when the safety rods were released, 
instead of shutting down the reactor began to pick up speed. The 
designers and scientists are to blame for this. And this too 
must be admitted...but still the main thing is that they should 
not have been careless with the reactor. It is dynamite. 
  [Gubarev] Is the same thing possible with yours? 
  [Stekolnikov] No. 
  [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, what will become of nuclear 
engineering in 50 years, what do you think? 
  [Stekolnikov] I think that the "fast reactors" that produce 
their own fuel will occupy their proper position in energy 
engineering. But I have doubts about thermonuclear installations 
where it is possible to obtain a large amount of energy as well. 
There are problems with materials there and not everything 
works. A great deal has been done in nuclear energy; the 
necessary base has been created--from prospecting for uranium to 
various kinds of installations. This is mainly to the credit of 
Yefim Pavlovich Slavskiy, who for many years was in charge of 
our nuclear industry and was able to think about the future. 
  [Gubarev] Is the nuclear infrastructure being destroyed now? 
  [Stekolnikov] A very stupid thing is being done. We are not 
living and working efficiently...of course the question of 
questions in nuclear energy engineering is safety. You are not 
afraid when you drive in a car or travel on a ship even though 
you may get into an accident and die. And yet the probability of 
having a collision or sinking is much greater than suffering 
from nuclear energy. People must understand this and then make 
their choice. 
  [Gubarev] How do you assess the present state of nuclear 
energy? I have in mind its division--into Russian, Ukrainian, 
Lithuanian, etc.? 
  [Stekolnikov] Pardon me for being so blunt, but it is a 
crime! What we are doing with nuclear energy today is a crime 
against people, against ourselves. What are we afraid of? It is 
thought that genetic mutations will occur under the influence of 
radiation, that is, mankind will begin to degenerate. Are there 
data or precise conclusions for this? No. So why are we so ready 
to work with them and use questionable theories? Large doses of 
radiation--that is understandable. Six hundred roentgens--and 
you are no more...but small doses, I am convinced, cause no 
harm. The entire history of mankind--since ancient times!--has 
proceeded with stronger radiation than the norms we establish 
for nuclear power plants. So we should be speaking about 
psychology and not about the real impact of radiation. 
  [Gubarev] I asked about the condition of the nuclear power 
plants in Russia and Ukraine. 
  [Stekolnikov] We have become accustomed to babbling about 
safety: they say it begins with the mining of ore and ends with 
the burial of the waste, and the nuclear power plant is 
somewhere in between. So we talk a lot about safety but we deal 
with it only when forced to; we do nothing without orders and 
directives from the higher leadership...let me give this 
example. In Germany in Nord we worked with an active zone. We 
had to look at 30 cassettes showing what was going on there. We 
took six or seven of them. I looked at them and it became clear 
to me. I said: We do not need any more...but the German was 
persistent: no, we will continue to work until I get all of the 
cassettes--those were his instructions... Essentially he was 
right, but I threw up my hands and left. It turns out that 
people perceive one and the same thing in different ways. We 
Russians still probably need the "stick," but we are beginning 
to "dodge," shameful as it is to admit it.... 
  [Gubarev] As a chief designer have you frequently had to use 
the "club"? 
  [Stekolnikov] It has happened...I have driven my close 
comrade to tears a couple of times. I tell him to do this or 
that. And he responds: That is not my job, it is the job of 
another department chief. I insist, and he agrees. Then I 
explain to him that I cannot--and we are friends!--work with a 
person who does not obey my orders, and therefore I dismiss him 
from his duties. 
  [Gubarev] And did you fire him? 
  [Stekolnikov] Of course...and he is a respected person, a 
prizewinner...well everyone protected him and defended him. Then 
he came to me and started crying. I withdrew the order. 
  [Gubarev] And does your conscience still bother you? 
  [Stekolnikov] I no longer have one. But discipline is 
necessary in our business, and responsibility as well. And that 
is why the orders of the chief designer have to be carried out. 
Unfortunately, we, that is, the chief designers, have to make 
"intellectual" decisions that are sometimes unusual. And they 
must be implemented, even though frequently many people do not 
agree with them. Therefore, we must be "strict"; otherwise, 
nothing will work. 
  [Gubarev] Where are your reactors in operation now? 
  [Stekolnikov] Let us try to list them. We will begin with 
Bulgaria--there are six blocks there. Hungary--four blocks. 
Czechoslovakia--four. Four blocks have been in operation in 
Germany and a fifth was started but now they have been removed. 
In Finland--two blocks. We now have in Kola--four, 
Voronezh--two, Rovno--two, well and there are others...quite 
unfortunately, the construction of new blocks has been 
postponed, and these are the reactors that are the most perfect. 
We have taken into account all mistakes from the past, created 
reliable machines, but these are the ones that the public 
attacked. I think a great mistake is being made. Oh, how we will 
regret this mistake in the near future! 
  [Gubarev] Are you familiar with foreign reactors? 
  [Stekolnikov] Of course. I have seen them in Italy, France, 
Belgium, Japan, Germany, and the United States. And I have 
crawled into all of them, felt them with my own hands, and 
inspected each unit down to the details--I always wonder whether 
they have thought of something better than ours. The designer 
has a terrible enemy--vibration. In Hungary I even talked the 
leaders into letting me go down under the reactor--I had to feel 
precisely how the vibration was occurring in the pipelines. They 
objected for a long time but I finally persuaded them--I crawled 
down there and felt it. There was one problem with it.... 
  [Gubarev] Can you compare them and us? 
  [Stekolnikov] We began to design reactors literally "from 
scratch." At least I did. About four people knew what had to be 
done--Kurchatov and his closest colleagues. As scientists they 
had calculated everything and we were supposed to make the 
concrete designs. With time came experience and a deeper 
understanding of the processes that take place in a reactor. 
  Today it seems to me that our scientists and designers are 
just as good as the Western ones, who have travelled the same 
path as we have. In some things they have achieved successes and 
outpaced us, but there are many areas where they have something 
to learn from us. So I cannot and will not bow to the West. We 
will cooperate with them on an equal basis; everyone stands to 
gain from this. And if someone wants to prove that they are 
"better" or we are--these people have no notion of science or 
technology. Most frequently this is the way politicians think. 
And bad ones at that.... 
  I know for sure that in the history of the development of 
nuclear energy over the decades we have not fallen behind anyone 
at any time. And we have the right to be proud.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Trubitsin: "Military Aircraft Were </F>
Acquired; the Process of Creating New Airline Companies Is 
Proceeding in Civil Aviation"] 
  [Text] Anxiety compelled Muscovite Nikolay Mitin to plan a 
long trip--to Uzbekistan. His mother, who lives in Chukuduk, 
wrote that she was very sick. But the main thing is that she 
wanted to see her son very much. 
  There were no problems with tickets: put up R96,000 for a 
one-way ticket, and then wait for the departure of a flight 
along the route Moscow-Tashkent-Chukuduk. There is one piece of 
bad luck: flights to Tashkent were postponed for the time being. 
One day followed another, the information service could not 
report anything instructive on dates for renewal of flights and, 
in the end, Nikolay Vasilyevich was compelled to turn in his 
ticket, losing R10,000 in the process. 
  I learned a lot in the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Transportation Department of Air Transportation to which I went 
to inquire about what was happening to our civil aviation. For 
example, about ticket prices. In comparison with December of 
last year, they increased by a factor of 31.5! The volume of 
passenger trips decreased by one-third for this reason, but 
Russia's civil aviation, nevertheless, got an opportunity to 
make ends meet. The aviators had no other way: the price of 
aviation fuel was increasing, but its share in the cost of 
passenger trips was lagging by 40-50 percent. The TU-154M is not 
a bad, as the specialists say, long-range aircraft, and it now 
costs almost 5 billion rubles [R], but in the near future, 
apparently, it will even reach 7 plus billions. But the aviators 
are not even guessing how much the new Il-96, Tu-204, and Il-114 
aircraft will cost. 
  Nonetheless, aircraft are being purchased. Just in this 
year, 
46 aircraft and 52 helicopters entered civil aviation. And what 
is interesting is that only three percent of the aircraft were 
acquired with state resources, and aviation enterprises also 
laid out their own money for three. The rest of the equipment 
was financed by nonstate structures. 
  Aviation is by no means a hopeless sphere for investing 
capital. If we are talking about property, there are no 
obstacles in this branch now to conversion into joint-stock 
companies and privatization. Just in nine months of this year, 
the department of air transportation rendered opinions on 97 
aviation enterprises that were subject to destatization. 
Twenty-two joint-stock companies were registered, and 11 of them 
are already selling shares of stock. The process proceeded, but 
the fact that it was slow has its own reasons. 
  Petr Petrovich Pasichnik, an acquaintance of mine who is an 
aviation engineer and a person with everyday common sense, 
thinks the following on this score: 
  "I do not particularly understand the subtleties of 
privatization. I know that there are three variants. Well, let 
us assume that we privatized and that I became a kind of coowner 
of my own aviation enterprise. But, tell me, what kind of 
capital can I invest in the business? Besides wages, I have 
nothing. My comrades also have nothing." 
  What also can be added to this fact is that a 
structural restructuring is taking place in the bosom of the 
aviation enterprises themselves, along with privatization. The 
aircraft go to the aviation companies, but everything that is on 
the ground remains the property of the airport. This is the way 
it is throughout the world. But we lived in our own way for 70 
years, and now we have to break a very strongly embedded system, 
and this process is painful. Indeed, even the former once 
monolithic Aeroflot disintegrated: civil aviation in the CIS 
countries is being established on its basis. New contacts and 
relations are still only being developed. For this reason, N. 
Mitin was unable to get information on a flight from Moscow to 
Uchkuduk, and how many other passengers remain uninformed about 
flights to neighboring foreign countries. 
  Civil aviation is truly undergoing birthing pains now. A 
majority of the companies that are being established on the 
basis of state aviation enterprises are in a bad way with 
investments. But, on the other hand, runways, the technical 
maintenance base, and personnel are under their jurisdiction, 
finally. Although private companies have money, they have to 
resolve problems with basing locations, they have to find their 
own niche on the market, acquire appropriate equipment, and 
attract the necessary personnel. 
  All of these problems also faced the founders of the Pilot 
Company in Krasnodar. It was headed not by a pilot, but by Yuriy 
Fedorovich Azarov, a lawyer. Something like this could not have 
even occurred to the leadership of the former Ministry of Civil 
Aviation. Only aviators were placed at the head of aviation 
enterprises at that time, inasmuch as a monopolist did not have 
to concern himself about financial effect: it did not matter, 
the money went into the common pocket. But now only a person who 
is enterprising, strong, and energetic can become the head of 
the company. 
  In planning their business, Azarov and his confederates 
tried 
to provide for everything. The bountiful Krasnodarskiy Kray is 
rich in agricultural products, a substantial part of which is 
exported. It is logical to deliver it where it is highly 
valued--to the north, for example. The Krasnodar aviation 
enterprise cannot cope with this alone, because it does not have 
heavy cargo aircraft. 
  Of course, the incipient company did not have such aircraft. 
At first it was decided to lease them in order to scrape the 
capital together for the purchase of a cargo plane. It invited 
the Krasnodar aviation enterprise with its facilities and the 
Kubanskiy kolkhoz, a strong producer of agricultural products, 
to be cofounders. 
  After earning the money, the company did not spend it on the 
purchase of Mercedes, but acquired an An-12 cargo aircraft from 
the military. True, it was "somewhat beat up," and the owners 
did not expect to get rid of it, and already had even agreed 
with the producer plant to place the aircraft on a pedestal 
along an avenue of the plant. The Krasnodar residents considered 
it more sensible to prepare it for flight, considering that it 
had a long expected life. After the An-12 was repaired, it began 
to perform a new service. And it performed the service not like 
state aircraft that spent a great part of the time standing on 
the ground, "Time is Money." 
  After accumulating more cash, Pilot leased an Il-76, which 
is 
capable of transporting up to 40 tonnes of cargo. The next stage 
will be the purchase of such an aircraft. 
  "We are now able to perform three to four trips abroad 
per week," explained Yuriy Fedorovich. "Entrepreneurs are also 
not averse to contacting us. To transport cargo abroad by sea 
takes a long time. It is far quicker and more convenient by air. 
We are receiving proposals from countries in Eastern Europe and 
the Near East." 
  Other aviation companies that appeared recently operate 
similar to Krasnodar's Pilot. The founders make the invested 
money work and aircraft fly and not stand idle, as happened in 
Aeroflot. Also beginning to compete successfully with state 
aviation enterprises are companies that strive to ensure good 
service and not permit unforeseen flight delays that are 
disadvantageous to themselves as well. It is a pity that Nikolay 
Vasilyevich Mitin did not have the opportunity to use those 
R96,000 for the services of another air line company. 
  An aircraft is a sign, a symbol of a society's civilization. 
That is the way it was here at one time, until Aeroflot slipped 
into a lack of culture. It remains to be hoped that the new 
times will restore the normal order of things. The kind of order 
under which a passenger does not expect a tolerable attitude 
toward him, as a good deed, but rather the aviators see in him a 
valued and desired customer.

<F P=106> [Article by Ruslan Ignatyev: "Specialists Investigating the </F>
Causes of the Tragedy Talk About the Air Crash Near Irkutsk"] 
  [Text] The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial office was 
visited yesterday by representatives of the Ministry of 
Transportation of the Russian Federation and the Aviation 
Scientific-Technical Complex imeni A.N. Tupolev, who are taking 
part in the work of the governmental commission on investigating 
the causes of the air crash in the area of the airport of the 
city of Irkutsk. They arrived from the site of the tragedy and 
gave us reliable information on what happened. 
  Present at the meeting were: Viktor Gorlov, deputy 
director of the department of air transport of the Ministry of 
Transport of Russia; Aleksandr Yemtsov, the chief of a section 
of the same department; Yuliy Kashtanov, first deputy general 
director and technical director of the Aviation 
Scientific-Technical Complex imeni A.N. Tupolev; and Valentin 
Shubin, chief of a section in the complex. Gennadiy Matyushov, 
deputy minister of transport of the Russian Federation, took 
part in the discussion. 
  We will elaborate the circumstances of the crash. On 3 
January 1994, passenger flight No. 130 on the Irkutsk-Moscow 
route was taking off from the Irkutsk city airport. The Tu-154 
aircraft, which belonged to the aviation company Baykal, took 
off at 0657 hours. It climbed to an altitude of 4,000 meters. 
When the liner was at a distance of 31 kilometers from the 
airport, the crew reported a fire in the second engine. This 
happened at 0702 hours. A decision was made to return. 
  Fire extinguishers were employed immediately to localize the 
fire. However, the pressure fell in all hydraulic systems. The 
aircraft went virtually out of control, which the crew reported. 
Afterward, contact was cut off, and the image of the aircraft on 
the radar scope disappeared. A total of six minutes passed from 
the moment of the report of the emergency. 
  The aircraft fell in the area of the village of Mamon, 15 
kilometers from the airport. When it hit the ground, it broke up 
and burned. According to established data, the aircraft was 
carrying five flight crew members, four air stewards, and 115 
passengers, including 16 citizens of foreign states 
(Germany--eight, PRC--four, India--one, Japan--one, 
Austria--one, France--one). Everyone was killed. During the 
crash, livestock farm buildings were damaged. There were three 
workers in them. One of them died, and two sustained burns. 
  As is known, by a directive of the Government of the Russian 
Federation of 3 January 1994, a government commission headed by 
Vitaliy Yefimov, the minister of transportation of Russia, was 
established to investigate the cause of the crash. 
  Specialists were attached to its work from civil aviation, 
the aviation industry, organs of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Procuracy 
General of the Russian Federation, and ministries of the Russian 
Federation on matters of civil defense, emergency situations and 
the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters, and 
also experts of other departments. The search and accident 
services have been working at the site of the tragedy. 
  Work is continuing at the present time on the evacuation of 
aircraft wreckage, and on cleaning up and tidying the area. The 
engines and a number of units were submitted for analysis. 
Experts of commissions and subcommissions are continuing the 
study of flight and technical documentation; they are analyzing 
data on systems for the objective monitoring of the condition 
and operation of aircraft systems and the actions of the crew 
during flight. Analysis is being conducted on the technical 
condition of the aircraft and its systems, and the nature of the 
destruction of the aircraft and its power plants is being 
investigated. A check is being made on the status of the 
organization of flight operations and the engineering and 
technical support of flights in the aviation company Baykal and 
in the Irkutsk airport. In a word, everything is being done that 
is necessary to establish the real cause of the crash. 
  As the discussion participants noted, a number of articles 
that have appeared in the mass media are puzzling. In 
particular, the press reported that allegedly the service life 
of the engines and the Tu-154M aircraft No. 85656 had expired 
long ago, and that the liner was produced in the 1970's and was 
obsolete. Moreover, it is being claimed that in the summer of 
last year during the termination of a passenger flight to China, 
it was on this aircraft that the second engine failed on the 
approach to Hangzhou. In addition to other things, journalists 
are already giving an evaluation of the crew's behavior; 
accusations are coming from newspaper pages that are directed at 
various departments and individuals, and working versions are 
being promulgated even though the investigation has not been 
completed. Frequently, outright disinformation is given. 
  These are the indubitable facts in this regard. The Tu-154M 
aircraft No. 85656 was produced by the Samara aviation plant on 
5 May 1989. Since the start of operation, it logged 10,358 
hours--this is only half the time that is prescribed for the 
operation of an aircraft of this kind. The liner could have 
flown 12,000 hours before overhaul. 
  The D-30KU-154 second-series engines produced by the Rybinsk 
enginebuilding association were mounted on the aircraft. Engine 
No. 2 had logged 4,835 hours. But the service life permitted it 
to be operated up to 5,600 hours. A check showed that both the 
aircraft and the engines were operated according to technical 
documentation within the limits of the prescribed service life. 
Aircraft overload was not established. Tu-154M No. 85656 did not 
perform the aforementioned flight to China. 
  To date, the onboard flight recorder--it records all crew 
conversations inside the cockpit and also all outside talk--has 
been found and decoded. At the present time, this so-called 
black box is in a special laboratory, where voice identification 
is being conducted. Also found was the magnetic recorder-memory 
device that measures aircraft movement parameters and system 
operations. Its case and magnetic tape were damaged; therefore, 
specialists are conducting a restoration of the recording. A 
third black box was also delivered to the laboratory. 
  Aircraft parts are being laid out in accordance with their 
onboard designation. A large part of them are undergoing 
analysis, and some have yet to be sent to special scientific 
analysis institutes in Moscow. There also are plans to ferry the 
engine. It is necessary to determine exactly why the fire 
occurred. 
  A program has already been developed to model the flight in 
special computer complexes. That is, the flight of the perished 
aircraft will be reproduced in accordance with the real 
conditions. 
  As for the actions of the crew in the situation that 
developed, nothing can be said unequivocally at the present 
time. G. Padukov, the aircraft commander and a pilot first 
class, graduated from the Civil Aviation Academy in 1973; he 
worked as the commander of An-2, Il-14, and Tu-104 aircraft. His 
flying time totals 13,600 hours, including 5,600 hours as a 
Tu-154 commander. A. Zhavoronkov, the copilot, also a pilot 
first class, graduated from the same educational institution, 
but 10 years later than the commander. But he also went through 
the same kind of practical schooling. Navigator V. Mollar has a 
total flying time of 14,900 hours, and of these 8,500 are on a 
Tu-154. Flight engineer I. Karpov, like his colleagues, is an 
experienced pilot. O. Likhodiyevskiy, chief navigator of the 
East Siberian Regional Administration of Air Transport, was a 
member of the crew on a planned inspection check. In general, 
all crew members had adequate training and a lot of experience. 
  The press is making complaints about the Tu-154 aircraft. 
They say that it is unreliable. At the present time, 397 Tu-154 
aircraft are in operation. Two hundred aircraft of this type are 
being used in the CIS [as published]. More than 50 percent of 
the passenger air traffic is being conducted on Tu-154's. In 22 
years of operation, 12 crashes were registered, and only one of 
them occurred because of aviation equipment failure. This was in 
1984 in the area of the city of Krasnodar. 
  It must be said that aircraft whose service life has expired 
are not operated. Today there is a large number of aviation 
companies with various forms of ownership. However, not one of 
them has the right to conduct flights without special 
authorization and special documents issued by the appropriate 
departments. Therefore, discussions that commercial structures 
are using old and irreparable aviation equipment are incompetent. 
  According to the assurances of Vitaliy Yefimov, the chairman 
of the government commission, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be able to 
acquire full information concerning the air crash at Irkutsk 
after completion of the investigation.

<F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA staff correspondent Nikolay </F>
Kireyev, Tula: "Smugglers Are Revealing Incognito Who Is 
Discrediting the Profitable Contracts of Russian Weapons Makers"] 
  [Text] At the end of last year, given in a number of 
sectors of the mass media as a sensational item was the report 
about the fact that members of the Main Administration for 
Combating Economic Crimes of the MVD RF [Russian Federation 
Ministry of Internal Affairs], together with their colleagues 
from the St. Petersburg service, "stopped an attempt by foreign 
commercial structures to export illegally 21,000 Makarov pistols 
and 4.5 million combat cartridges." What followed later was even 
more curious: "In order to make unlicensed shipments of weapons, 
the smugglers had drawn up phony documents for the pistols and 
ammunition, assigning them to the category of hunting and 
sporting items." 
  Having read in the newspaper and heard on radio and 
television such information which, in its time frames, coincided 
with the visit of President B.N. Yeltsin to Tula and its defense 
enterprises, I immediately began to seek out the "guilty 
parties" among the weapons and ammunition makers. 
  It turned out that, back in November, V. Shiryayev, the 
general manager of an ammunition plant, had sent a memorandum 
addressed to O. Soskovets: "Dear Oleg Nikolayevich. The AO 
[Joint-Stock Company] Tula Ammunition Plant is one of the 
largest producers of small-arms cartridges in Russia. As a 
result of conversion in the years 1989-1992, the output of 
various products has been curtailed by 50-100 percent. In order 
to find additional financial resources for conversion needs, in 
1993, the company started producing sporting and hunting 
cartridges intended to be fired from Russian-made and 
foreign-made sports pistols: IZh-70, IZh-75, Parabellum, 
Brunner, Walther, Luger, and Beretta. Testing of the cartridges 
and their certification have been conducted in full conformity 
with the requirements of the standards and regulations of 
Gosstandart RF [Committee on Standardization, Metrology and 
Certification]. These cartridges are being produced solely for 
export shipments and conform to international specifications and 
world-class analogs." 
  "The plant's specialists have studied the sales markets. As 
a 
result, contracts have been signed with the largest firms of the 
USA, Canada, Germany and Austria for the delivery in 1993-1994 
of sporting and hunting ammunition in the amount of 350 million 
rounds at a price of $20 million, American." 
  "At the present time, 10 million rounds have already been 
shipped to one of the American firms, which has sent us the 
end-use certificate issued by the U.S. State Department. 
However, as of 14 September, 1993, the shipping of sporting and 
hunting ammunition has been stopped at the request of the RF 
State Customs Committee [GTK RF]. Despite the authorization of 
the RF State Committee on the Defense Industry of 9 November 
1993, and MVES RF [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of 10 
November 1993, the AO Tula Ammunition Plant is carrying out the 
exporting of sporting and hunting ammunition without licenses 
and without the approval of the RF State Customs Committee." 
  "The company is incurring direct losses from the exporting 
ban in the amount of $275,600, and from the non-execution of 
contracts during the fourth quarter in the amount of $1,285,930." 
  "I earnestly request that you instruct the State Customs 
Committee to give our company authorization to export sporting 
and hunting ammunition without having to obtain a license. This 
would make it possible not only to straighten out the 
enterprise's financial situation, to develop the production of 
products capable of competing in the world market, to maintain a 
mobilization potential and to retain highly skilled specialists, 
but also to enrich Russia's treasury significantly." 
  Attached to the memorandum was an addendum: 
  "In conformity with Decree No 854 of the RF Government of 6 
November 1992, the exporting and importing of sport and hunting 
weapons and ammunition for them shall be carried out without a 
license from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, 
as well as on the basis of the RF Law "On Weapons" of 20 May, 
1993 (Articles 5 and 17): 
  "1. The Tula Ammunition Plant shall be authorized to export 
sporting and hunting ammunition... to do this without a license 
from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. 
  "2. It shall be established that a decision on matters 
involving the exporting of sporting and hunting ammunition shall 
be made after the exporter has submitted to the RF Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations the contracts and their accompanying 
documents and they are examined by an Interdepartmental Council 
of the interested ministries. 
  "I.S. Materov, RF deputy minister of foreign economic 
relations. 
  "Yu.N. Starodub, deputy chairman of the RF State Committee 
on 
the Defense Industry." 
  After familiarizing himself with these documents, O. 
Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the government, passes a 
resolution: 
  "To the RF State Customs Committee (A.S. Kruglov), 
  "I request that you consider and give approval within the 
framework of the existing legislation." 
  This was on 7 December 1993. And, after a few days, the 
printed and electronic mass media informed the world about the 
fact that "contraband has been seized." 
  "And who will have dealings with us after this?" V. 
Shiryayev 
asks with righteous indignation. "I do not know who would profit 
from bringing us to our knees. The government leaders are on our 
side. Even the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The Main 
Rocket and Artillery Directorate has concluded that the 
cartridges we sold are not combat ones, but ones with lead 
cores. The entire world trades in such `slippery items.' For us, 
however -- this is a no-no! It is unthinkable that, in caring 
about the honor of the dress coat, any one should forget about 
its cleanliness." 
  It is hard to disagree with one of the oldest and most 
experienced defense industry workers. It is fitting to recall 
that, in 1988, there was established in our country a powerful 
industry for the production of ammunition, which was equipped 
with unique domestic equipment automatic rotor and 
rotor-conveyor lines. As a result of conversion, the production 
of various types of cartridges has been curtailed by factors of 
10-18, which has led to a sharp decrease in funds and the flight 
of skilled personnel. The specialists associate the retreat from 
traditional sales markets precisely with the production cutback. 
  In order to look for practical ways of preventing the 
sector's collapse, it is necessary to engage in selling 
ammunition for civilian use abroad. We have entered a market 
which is the most promising and prestigious for Russia -- the 
USA, where, annually, the retail trade network sells from 9 to 
14 million rounds of ammunition, which are produced not only by 
American firms, but are also imported from China, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia and Poland. While our cartridges remain out 
of the running. But, apparently, someone does not like this: he 
says, let the ammunition makers continue to produce bicycle 
chains, photo enlargers, toys and thermoses. Let them cram the 
warehouses with finished products. Let a mighty sector perish. 
  It turns out that, now, even the arguments of the president 
of Russia may be ignored. Not to mention the first deputy prime 
minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Komov, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management, by 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Gavrilyuk: "Land Can 
Be Sold... if Roskomzem Permits It"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] At the end of last year, there occurred an 
event which was remarkable, if not to say outstanding. We are 
talking about the president's Edict "On a State Land Registry 
and the Registration of Documents on the Rights To Own Real 
Estate" and, following that, the government-issued Statute "On 
the Holding of Competitions and Auctions for the Sale of Land 
Parcels and Other Land Transactions." 
  A land registry is the pride of any country. In the former 
USSR, it arose over a long period of time and with difficulty 
and its basis was the rated appraisal of the land's fertility. 
Today, however, all these efforts have proven to be of little 
use. Nikolay Komov, the chairman of Roskomzem [Russian 
Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management], 
expressed his opinion on this matter quite definitively: "The 
state is the property and the property is the registry." 
  So, the former system could not ensure the rights of an 
owner 
to the land -- there was no actual owner. And if the leadership 
demanded that a birch grove appear on the registry instead of a 
clearly existing field, then the land managers did what was 
desired, in any event, on paper. 
  I will not conceal the fact that it was strange to hear this 
from the head of Russian land management. But it is precisely 
such revalations which are giving rise to a certain optimism -- 
now, if the leadership were to demand that a ravine be called a 
plain, the Russian Federation [RF] Committee on Land Resources 
and Land Management, we would hope, would not permit this. And 
1.7 million hectares of Russian land will be described and, 
consequently, appraised accurately and impartially. The only 
cause for concern is the fact that, now, the appraisal of the 
land's fertility is going, as it were, on the back burner. 
  Meanwhile, the specialists' opinions on the matter of the 
Statute "On the Holding of Competitions and Auctions for the 
Sale of Land Parcels and Other Land Transactions" have been 
sharply divided. 
  For example, the experts from Minselkhoz [Ministry of 
Agriculture] believe that a number of statutes, adopted 
government decrees and ones currently in preparation on matters 
involving the buying and selling of land substantially infringe 
on the rights of citizens and lay a foundation for turning the 
RF Committee on Land Resources and Land Management into the 
largest land speculator in the country. The document may 
stimulate a surge of bribery and, in the final tally, discredit 
the idea of a land market, in particular, because local land 
committees, along with the functions of monitoring land use, 
have received the right to buy land and to resell it. And the 
mechanism for holding the competitions and auctions is also 
adding problems. For example, "when there are buyers who have a 
preferential right to purchase a land parcel," a closed auction 
is held and only in the remaining instances can a seller sell a 
parcel independently or at a public auction. 
  Since the document does not distinguish lands by categories, 
this means that any transaction involving the sale of land, 
including even a vacation parcel, will require authorization 
from the organs of the RF Committee on Land Resources and Land 
Management. The granted right to sell land, the Ministry of 
Agriculture's experts conclude, is giving rise in Russia to "one 
more area of corruption" and is curtailing the rights of 
individual types of owners. 
  Such harsh assessments make it necessary to turn for a 
commentary to the chairman of the RF Committee on Land Resources 
and Land Management, Nikolay Komov. 
  [Gavrilyuk] The edict on the land registry and the 
government 
statute on the holding of competitions and auctions for the sale 
of land parcels went into effect simultaneously. What kind of 
connection is there between these documents? 
  [Komov] The president instructed the government to prepare, 
in all, around 10 documents and it is impossible to consider any 
of them separately. I would call all this a mechanism for the 
implementation of the president's edict on the regulation of 
land relations. And the government statute is, if it can be put 
this way, just a fragment. It will not, for all practical 
purposes, pertain to lands under agricultural cultivation. 
Worthless land falls into its domain. Indeed, just as before: 
the head of an administration decided to give someone a land 
parcel -- and no one can prevent him from doing this, to build 
for free a house or a cottage. Now, however, the land will be 
shown off at auctions. They are already being prepared in the 
Krasnogorsk, Odintsovsk and Podolsk rayons of Moscow Oblast. 
Quite a bit of money will go into the treasury. Even now, in 
some rayons, a plot of land with a cottage being built on it 
costs several million rubles [R]. Just in Moscow, we are 
receiving around R40 billion for the right to lease. 
  [Gavrilyuk] What is the special feature of the Edict "On a 
State Land Registry and the Registration of Documents on the 
Rights To Own Real Estate"? 
  [Komov] This is an historic document, first of all, because 
now relations between a citizen, a legal person and lands will 
be regulated by the Civil Code. It has already been prepared for 
consideration in the State Duma. The land has been declared real 
property and, likewise, everything located on it. Prior to the 
emergence of this edict, land parcels were registered in the 
land committees and structures in the housing and municipal 
services organs and everything was broken up, which made it 
impossible to determine the true value of the land parcel: some 
got the land and others got the structures on it. Now both have 
been declared real property and will be appraised together. 
  We will register not just the land, but also everything 
which 
has been built on it. For example, in Moscow, the amount of the 
land tax is being raised by tens of factors. In the near future, 
a presidential commission on real property matters will be 
established. 
  [Gavrilyuk] And who will appraise this real property? 
  [Komov] We have two alternatives. First, a special agency 
for 
appraising both the land and the structures on it, that is, the 
real property, will be established. Second, the currently 
existing technical inventory bureaus will work for us under 
contract or will transfer into the system of the RF Committee on 
Land Resources and Land Management. Now, however, in many 
territories, outright deception of the peasants is occurring, 
since no one knows the true value of the land and it is being 
purchased at times for next to nothing. 
  [Gavrilyuk] What will the appraisal mechanism be like? 
  [Komov] A person who wishes to find out the value of his 
land 
should turn to us, to the committee, where he will find out the 
approximate value of the land and the approximate registry for 
the entire country, but soon it will be precise. 
  The president has already approved a sample copy of a 
certificate of the right to own land, there will be 80 million 
of them and all the landowners will receive them in the first 
half of 1994. Only this document gives the owner of the land 
parcel the right to lease it out, to mortgage it, to exchange it 
or to sell it. 
  And so, now, many kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock 
companies are buying up from the pensioners their land shares. 
But what can be bought up when their owners do not have the 
document for the right to own these shares? Such transactions 
will not be valid. 
  [Gavrilyuk] Yet, all the same, when will the Russian Land 
Registry be ready? 
  [Komov] We are introducing it in 1994-1995, but the 
registration process is very lengthy and, in essence, it is 
constant. 
  [Gavrilyuk] Why is real property linked with the registry? 
  [Komov] Because not only in our country, but throughout the 
entire world, no other mechanism has been devised: when land is 
registered, everything on it is also appraised. And later, 
supposedly, a data base will be created so we can know what is 
on the land and under the land; otherwise, it will be absolutely 
impossible to manage the entire infrastructure. 
  [Gavrilyuk] Let us return, however, to the statute on public 
and closed auctions. What is the difference here? 
  [Komov] Whereas, with public auctions, everything is clear, 
who is profiting and who is paying more, when closed auctions 
are held, there are certain special features. To illustrate, I 
will cite an example. 
  In Moscow, quite a few gasoline service stations are being 
opened now. But look -- a third of them, if not half, are not 
operating -- there is no gasoline. So now, in order to obtain 
land to lease for that same gas station, the person wishing to 
open it has to produce during a closed auction a quota, 
certified in the Ministry of Economics, which certifies that the 
gasoline service station will be supplied with gasoline, oil and 
everything needed for normal operation.

"On One-Time Compensation for Russian Federation Savings Bank 
Depositors Who Held Deposits as of 1 January 1992"] 
  [Text] In order to provide partial compensation for 
citizens' depreciated savings on deposit in the Russian

grounds of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Russian Federation

  1. That the Russian Federation Savings Bank is to add 
one-time compensations for deposits held by Russian Federation 
citizens and persons of equivalent status in the bank concerned 
in the amount of three times their deposits as of 1 January 1992. 
  Payment of the compensations indicated is to be made to 
depositors who are pensioners and disabled beginning 1 February 
1994 and to the other depositors beginning 1 July 1994. 
  2. For the financial resources needed to provide for 
implementation of the measures stipulated in Paragraph 1 of this 
Edict: 
  a) The Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and 
Precious Stones is to release assets valued at 400 billion 
rubles [R] in the State Fund of Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones of the Russian Federation for their sale in the procedure 
established, in accordance with the decision by the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers and Government, on the foreign 
market, as well as to commercial banks, with the transfer of the 
funds obtained to the Russian Federation Savings Bank; and 
  b) The Russian Federation Central Bank is to make a 
proposal, 
to a general meeting of Russian Federation Savings Bank 
stockholders, on the allocation of R200 billion from the profit 
received by this bank in 1993 to pay for the one-time 
compensations. 
  3. The Russian Federation Savings Bank is to provide 
information no later than 15 January 1994 to the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Finance on distribution of the funds 
earmarked to provide the one-time compensations for deposits 
among the territorial institutions of the Russian Federation 
Savings Bank. 
  4. In the event that insufficient funds are acquired in 
conformity with this Edict to pay the one-time compensations for 
deposits, the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance is to 
submit proposals to the Russian Federation Council of Ministers 
and Government before 1 February 1994 on the sources of 
additional funds. 
  5. Taking into consideration the need to restrain possible 
inflationary processes as a consequence of implementing the 
measures stipulated by this Edict, it is recommended that organs 
of executive authority of republics in the Russian Federation, 
krays, oblasts, and autonomous okrugs in cities of federal 
importance, as well as organs of local self-government, grant 
persons receiving the one-time compensations, when the entire 
sum of the compensation is transferred during January 1994 to a 
separate interest-free deposit account, the right to pay within 
the limits of these funds for municipal and housing services 
provided to them at the rates (assessments) in effect as of 1 
November 1993 
  Banking institutions are to transfer the funds accumulated 
by

<F P=106> [Interview with Levon Ter-Petrosyan by Armen Khanbabyan; </F>
place and date not given: "The Formation of the CIS Enabled Us 
To Avoid the `Yugoslav Scenario': Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan Believes That Russia and the CSCE Should 
Consolidate Efforts for a Settlement of the Karabakh Conflict"] 
  [Text] 
  [Khanbabyan] You are the sole head of state of the 
Transcaucasus who has right from the start participated in the 
work of bodies of the CIS: Aliyev and Shevardnadze joined their 
colleagues only in Ashgabat. To what extent will it be possible 
to harmonize positions now, when the easiest part of the path 
has already been covered? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Armenia, the first of the former Soviet 
republics to subscribe to the Belovezha Treaty, proceeded from 
the obvious fact that the Soviet Union was falling apart. It was 
important to lessen the danger of its uncontrolled collapse, and 
the CIS accomplished this mission brilliantly. We prevented the 
"Yugoslav scenario" and did not allow local intrastate conflicts 
to grow into a large-scale war, and this is to the credit of all 
countries, primarily Russia. 
  A second important fact: the former Soviet republics had to 
consider that they could be left out of world systems, security 
systems primarily. The fact of the new states' acquisition of 
independence did not in itself increase their essential options, 
either political or economic. Under these conditions the CIS was 
and still is the sole system guaranteeing the security of the 
former Soviet republics. 
  And the third--economic motives. We proceeded from the fact 
that while a search for new economic relations, new markets, and 
new world and regional structures was still under way, it would 
be beneficial for all states to have or, at least, try to 
preserve the economic relations and markets that existed in the 
time of the Soviet Union. This factor will exert a pronounced 
influence on the behavior of all states for the coming decades. 
  [Khanbabyan] The Armenian premier observed in Ashgabat that 
we have created something unprecedented--all current unions are 
united by rich countries; we, however, have a union of poor 
countries.... 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Whatever you say, whatever new relations are 
established, the reality is that the "intra-CIS" market remains, 
for all that, the priority for all the republics. But this is a 
very distinctive market. 
  There is no economic union in practice as yet. 
Implementation 
of its basic principles--a common tax and financial policy, a 
harmonized budget deficit, single customs tariffs--will take a 
great deal of work and a long time. We have signed hundreds of 
documents and will sign hundreds more, but no multilateral 
treaty regulating the relations of several members of the CIS is 
operating. Everything is supported at the present time on 
something entirely different--exclusively on bilateral 
intergovernmental agreements. Private business also operates 
mainly on a bilateral basis, but there is greater cooperation 
there currently than at the interstate level. Free enterprise is 
less dependent on political relations between countries. We 
should be developing multilateral cooperation at the state level 
also. It is very important now, for the period of formation of 
the economic union, to create new mechanisms. 
  Proceeding from these considerations, Armenia made a 
specific 
proposal at the Ashgabat meeting. Its essence is as follows: 
there is as yet no common financial entity, an interstate bank, 
which could make payments in the national currencies, and we 
need to create a payments union--a practical mechanism that 
would under no circumstances contradict the idea and principles 
of the Treaty on Economic Union. Clearing, which we perform 
currently on a bilateral basis, needs to be made multilateral. 
This would afford an opportunity for alleviating reciprocal 
payments. I am pleased that our proposal was received with great 
enthusiasm in Ashgabat, and this matter will be on the agenda at 
the next meeting of heads of government. 
  [Khanbabyan] Nonetheless, there was one decision which 
affected everyone and which adjusted somewhat the mutual 
relations of the members of the CIS--Russia's decision to "end" 
the ruble area. It was, by all accounts, the cause of economic 
problems in the republics and weakened the political positions 
of regimes "friendly" toward Moscow. 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Under no circumstances am I about to accuse 
Russia. A very serious internal debate on the strategy of the 
Russian state was, truly, conducted for a long time there. On 
the one hand a team of new politicians and brilliant reform 
economists, which took as the basis purely economic 
considerations.... 
  [Khanbabyan] Pragmatic.... 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] No, this was not opportunist, their position 
was based on a very serious analysis, and I understand them full 
well. 
  On the other hand, there is in Russia also a purely 
political 
current which originated in traditional-state considerations. 
The struggle between these two currents of political and 
economic thought is of an objective nature and is not dependent 
on Russia's sympathies for or antipathies toward other states. 
It is hard to say which considerations will be predominant in 
the future, but it had become clear to everyone last fall 
without declarations and without any explanations that Russia 
had at that moment adopted a decision in support of its own 
economic interests. After which the other states had no choice 
but to take their own action. 
  [Khanbabyan] Was Armenia prepared for such a turn of events? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] We anticipated it, and not only us--all the 
states had ahead of time been keeping their own, already printed 
currency in their safes. But it was not we who chose the moment. 
Had anything been up to us, Armenia would not be introducing its 
own money at this time. We needed to prepare for this step, 
preserve mechanisms of normal trade with our partners, and 
gently, preparing currency and commodity reserves, move toward 
such radical reform. 
  [Khanbabyan] You believe that the debate in the Supreme 
Council of Armenia to the effect that the dram should have been 
introduced earlier, in a more propitious economic situation, was 
without foundation? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Yes, it was. It was not in our interests to 
sever the common ruble space with Russia, there would in this 
case have been great difficulties and more complications than 
there are now. 
  [Khanbabyan] Have the "model" Armenian-Russian relations 
changed as of late? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] There has been essentially no change in our 
relations. I have already cited one factor--proceeding from 
economic considerations, Russia made its choice, which had 
negative consequences for the economy of Armenia, but I do not 
believe that this step was aimed against our country. 
  And, the second: problems arose for us with Russia, as, 
equally, with other countries, in connection with the Karabakh 
conflict. Naturally, the world community and Russia, which is a 
part of it and which, in addition, has its own interests in the 
region, are concerned at the development of the conflict. They 
recognize that its continued escalation threatens the danger of 
a wider international conflict, which is in no one's interests. 
  [Khanbabyan] Did the incident involving Ambassador Kazimirov 
influence the situation in any way? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] No, not in the least. The incident involving 
Kazimirov was ultimately seen by everyone as an annoying 
misunderstanding. 
  [Khanbabyan] Let us return to Ashgabat, where you met with 
Aliyev and Shevardnadze--a kind of small regional conference. 
What was the discussion about? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Armenia is concerned first and foremost for 
the possibility of normal freight shipments, and for this reason 
we have many day-to-day problems connected with Georgia. We are 
inclined to believe that these problems are not a consequence of 
an official policy pursued by the leadership of the neighboring 
republic. It is simply that the state in Georgia is not strong 
yet and that the authorities are not in control of the situation 
in the country. There are no political problems with Tbilisi, we 
have full mutual understanding. The discussion with Shevardnadze 
was only about him, considering our difficult situation, doing 
everything he can to normalize transportation. 
  As far as Aliyev is concerned, this was not our first 
meeting. I do not say that it will have any practical results. 
Until Azerbaijan switches from words to deeds and until it 
substitutes a realistic policy for propaganda, all negotiations 
and meetings are useless. But I support a continuation of 
contacts, in any event. What do I mean by a realistic policy? 
There are two long-suffering plans of a settlement of the 
Karabakh problem. The plan of the CSCE and the Russian plan of a 
settlement, which, in terms of content, the phased nature of 
fulfillment, mechanisms, and satisfaction of each party's 
requirements does not differ from the CSCE plan. The sole, but 
appreciable, difference between the two documents is that the 
Russian plan contains a clear-cut mechanism guaranteeing a 
nonresumption of military operations--the presence of a 
peacemaking force. This is a powerful argument. 
  The CSCE plan is the result of a compromise, and each side 
has its complaints about it, naturally. That is the point of a 
compromise. Armenia and Karabakh agreed to this plan; 
Azerbaijan, on the other hand, rejected it. 
  Armenia and Karabakh also consent to the Russian version, 
even in the preliminary form presented by Russia. Azerbaijan is 
evading this also. At the Ashgabat meeting Aliyev delivered the 
customary statement, propaganda, rather, at which I proposed a 
switch from words to deed: "You have rejected the CSCE plan, let 
us sign the Russian proposals, getting together in a few days 
with Boris Nikolayevich in Moscow--you, I, and Robert 
Kocharyan." Yeltsin supported me.... 
  [Khanbabyan] Aliyev agreed? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Aliyev once again put forward conditions. 
The 
fact is that Azerbaijan is not yet prepared to accept this plan 
either. But we agreed to work at it, and working meetings of the 
presidents' personal representatives will, most likely, begin in 
January. If they are successful, a meeting of foreign ministers 
is envisaged, and the culminating stage will be a meeting of the 
presidents, at which an agreement could be signed. 
  [Khanbabyan] And what is the explanation for the existence 
of 
two plans--rivalry? And will work on the CSCE plan continue? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] They are not mutually exclusive so it should 
not be thought that this is a counterpoise. Disagreements have 
arisen, and there is no need to conceal this, but currently both 
Russia and the CSCE are seeking opportunities to consolidate 
efforts, the efforts of the parties involved in the conflict 
included, for the formulation of a single plan of settlement of 
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
  The existence of two plans is in itself pushing back the 
start of a solution of this problem because it affords both 
Karabakh and Azerbaijan opportunity for maneuver. But, as I have 
already said, a paradoxical situation has now arisen: Karabakh 
and Armenia are prepared to agree to both plans, implying that 
in time they will merge because they do not contradict but 
complement one another. But Azerbaijan rejects them. I am 
convinced that Russia and the CSCE will find a way to unite 
their efforts, and sooner or later Azerbaijan will be forced to 
agree. 
  [Khanbabyan] If agreement is reached, how, in this case, do 
you evaluate the prospect of a normalization of relations with 
Azerbaijan--several years, several generations? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] No, this will happen very quickly if peace 
is 
established and a compromise is found. And compromise means that 
the solution should more or less satisfy all parties. 
  [Khanbabyan] But there would continue to be forces in 
Armenia 
and in Karabakh and in Azerbaijan which a compromise would not 
satisfy. 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Handling them is the duty of the state; 
otherwise, it will perish. It should be remembered that there 
cannot be a common opinion in a normal society; there will 
always be those unhappy with the authorities and with this 
decision or the other of theirs. 
  [Khanbabyan] But I do not recall alternative solutions of 
the 
Karabakh problem having been seriously discussed in Armenia, 
there has been debate.... 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] We have two problems connected with 
Karabakh--a cease-fire and its status. The first is discussed 
daily at all levels--it is a problem of war and peace. The 
second we have deliberately taken off the agenda, and we have 
sought to ensure that the question of status not be broached in 
a single international document--not in resolutions of the 
United Nations, not in documents of the CSCE, not in the Russian 
plan. 
  We have proceeded from the fact that the efforts of the 
parties concerned need to be channeled primarily into the 
achievement of peace. After this a lengthy negotiating process, 
where legal problems, primarily, of course, the question of the 
status of Karabakh, will be resolved, will begin. 
  [Khanbabyan] A regime has been created in Karabakh which 
differs greatly from the one that exists in Armenia--a military 
regime. How will it be possible to harmonize positions when 
there are two different systems of power? And how subsequently 
can this military state be adapted to peaceful life? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] What you say really is the case--different 
regimes and different forms of government in Armenia and 
Karabakh. There is a wartime regime there, and this is justified 
as yet: everything is centralized, everything is subordinated to 
the requirements of wartime. If the war ends, civilian 
authorities will be formed there, naturally. 
  In Armenia there is a civil state, which under these 
difficult conditions is endeavoring to preserve all the 
structures of peacetime. Although this is creating certain 
difficulties. 
  [Khanbabyan] Have there been proposals for application of 
the 
Karabakh experience here? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] The opposition is demanding stringent 
measures. But even in the present situation we are managing 
without this, thank God. We have no such intention. 
  [Khanbabyan] But in voting in 1990 the people hardly 
suspected what ordeals awaited them. What will they vote for 
next time--for light, gas, and transportation that operates 
normally or for strict authorities? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] I fear nothing that is constitutional. If 
some political force comes to power by having mustered a 
particular number of votes, this choice has to be respected. 
  [Khanbabyan] Levon Akopovich, the Russian experience has 
shown that even such a democratic procedure as the adoption of a 
constitution and new elections leads in a difficult economic 
situation to the electorate voting for people on the political 
fringe--in expectation of change. 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Unfortunately, no one, not a single person, 
or entire peoples even learn from the mistakes of others. If 
this is a mistake of the people, it is they who will rectify it. 
The main thing is that we under no circumstances permit an 
illegitimate change of power. This always ultimately damages the 
state. I am prepared to accept the results of any elections, but 
do not consent to the assumption of office of the worthiest 
people unlawfully. 
  [Khanbabyan] During discussion of the government program the 
opposition once again demanded the resignation of the cabinet 
and a reallocation of competent authority. You once said that a 
coalition government is the result of compulsion. 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] The opposition's demands are entirely 
sincere--it believes throughout the world that it is more fit to 
run the country than those who are in power. But in saying that 
there are circumstances that compel a coalition I did not mean 
that the opposition should compel it. If there arises in 
parliament a situation where no one force can form a government 
and the president cannot get enacted a single law or a single 
decision--a situation threatening total paralysis of the 
executive--two possible paths of a solution remain. Either the 
creation of a coalition government in accordance with the 
percentage representation of the parties in parliament or the 
president dissolves parliament. These mechanisms exist in many 
countries, they are constitutional. They are lacking in Armenia 
as yet, as were they in Russia also, which led to the tragedy of 
3-4 October. 
  As far as the claims of the opposition are concerned, it is 
its right to criticize, but it is my right to disagree with its 
assessments. In the language of mathematics, I am not required 
to take into account what the deputies say until they muster a 
majority of votes and parliament adopts decisions with which I 
am obliged to reckon. This is the language in which we should 
converse with one another. At the state level there are two 
mechanisms for determining the truth--elections and the voting 
of the elective bodies. 
  [Khanbabyan] You rule out the "Georgian" or "Tajik" options 
in Armenia? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] I am convinced that this will not happen. 
The 
people of Armenia, despite the most difficult living conditions, 
recognize that the sole guarantee of the preservation of an 
independent state is society's internal stability.

<F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "Armenian Army Has Food, Uniforms </F>
and Authority"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] It is obvious by now that 
[former minister of defense] Vazgen Manukian played an important 
role in finally converting the various Armenian armed units into 
a regular army during the 9 to 10 months (October 1992 through 
July 1993) he was in office. That interval also coincides with a 
period of relative peace on Armenia's borders, the recapture of 
Maghavuz and Martakert in Artsakh and the success in Kelbajar. 
Evidently the work that [Manukian] started has continued in the 
same direction: As encouraging news reported by the NOYAN TAPAN 
news agency on 17 December suggests, problems associated with 
antagonisms that could be caused by the formation of the 
Armenian army have been set aside. 
  A meeting was held at the conclusion of the fall 
conscription 
campaign to tally up its results. Vazgen Sargsian, a former 
minister of defense and currently the minister of state 
responsible for defense affairs, says that the conscription has 
concluded successfully everywhere except in the two large cities 
of the earthquake zone, Gumri [formerly Leninakan] and Vanadzor 
[formerly Kirovakan]. So far 511 conscripts are missing in Gumri 
and 244 in Vanadzor. The deadline for reporting to duty has been 
extended by 7 to 10 days in those cities. 
  Problems associated with conscription were one of the 
principal reasons delaying the formation of the army for a long 
time. A not so insignificant proportion of the youth in cities 
tried every means to dodge the draft. Their parents also did 
everything necessary to make their children's task easier. Both 
the youth and their parents had forgotten the conditions of 
serving in distant locations in the Soviet army in the past. 
That led to demonstrations and hunger strikes on Yerevan's 
squares, with the demand that Armenian soldiers serve their 
terms in Armenia. Ironically, when those seemingly unrealizable 
dreams came true so suddenly, those subject to the draft sought 
ways of dodging it rather than rejoice. The report cited above 
does not offer details of the methods employed in the gratifying 
correction of this problem, but the important point is that a 
shameful and extremely dangerous situation has ended. That is 
affirmed most strongly by the following statement: "Incidents of 
administrative action to ensure the normal progress of the 
conscription campaign are becoming steadily rarer." 
  Of course, all this does not mean that the process of 
building the army no longer faces any difficulties or that there 
are no deficiencies to correct. For example, sometimes it is 
difficult to determine the permanent residences of young men who 
have migrated from Azerbaijan. It is also said that barracks 
buildings are insufficient. V. Sargsyan says that a new census 
must be taken in Armenia. The last one, taken in January 1989, 
immediately after the [December 1988] earthquake, cannot be 
considered reliable because it could not provide a true picture 
of the population. The most rejoicing element of the said report 
is that the meeting underscored the following despite the 
complex problems facing the country: "The army is fully stocked 
with food and uniforms." 
  The NOYAN TAPAN report provides other details also. 
Armenia's 
military academy will begin operating next year and will train 
officers. At present Armenian officers are trained in Russia. 
Some of the current conscripts serve in the ranks of Russian 
border forces on Armenia's borders with Turkey and Iran, as well 
as the Russian 127th division, which is based near Gumri. 
  Despite the many positive signs, V. Sargsian is far from 
being fully satisfied. He says: "Although many observers 
consider the Armenian army the most combat-ready in the region, 
the Armenian leadership itself is viewing the national army 
critically, finding that much more must be done to consolidate 
the army's combat readiness and that the weakness of the armed 
forces of Azerbaijan and Georgia are temporary." 
  It can be gathered from the report that there is something 
more than the statement that "the army is fully stocked with 
food and uniforms." The reality of a successful conscription is 
proof that the problem of authority has been resolved. Those two 
points are sufficient to confirm that the army of independent 
Armenia has successfully overcome the basic hurdles of the 
initial period.

  [Text] The report prepared by Turkish security circles 
about relations between the PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party] and 
Armenia--about which we wrote based on material from ZAMAN--is 
the subject of a front-page article in today's CUMHURIYET. The 
article notes that the PKK, in collaboration with ASALA 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] will launch 
an attack on Turkey next spring. The article also says that 
Armenian villages near the Turkish border offer support of all 
types to the PKK. 
  Goksel Polad writes [in CUMHURIYET] that the Turkish 
security 
circles assume that PKK guerrillas trained in camps in Armenia 
will launch attacks against Turkey from the Armenian border in 
the spring of 1994, together with ASALA militants. The report by 
the Security Directorate General notes that the PKK has 
established camps in Armenian villages near the Turkish border 
inhabited by Armenians of Kurdish ancestry hostile to Turkey. 
  PKK militants train in camps in the Bekaa in Lebanon and 
Zeli 
in northern Iraq, together with ASALA militants. The said report 
provides the following information about Armenian-PKK relations: 
  ASALA militants are trained in PKK camps in Jordan and 
Syria. 
Trained ASALA militants recruit new guerrillas and procure 
armaments [for the PKK]. This assistance continues today. 
  [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan [Apo], who receives aid from 
Armenia and ASALA, conducts ties with Armenia personally. He has 
established training camps in Armenian villages near the Turkish 
border, and training is under way in those camps today. These 
activities are carried out with the knowledge and complicity of 
the Armenian government. The camps are in villages inhabited by 
Armenians of Kurdish ancestry hostile to Turkey. 
  The PKK and ASALA militants trained in these camps will 
attack Turkey from Armenia's borders in the near future, 
probably in the spring of 1994. 
  The report also enumerates the names of the villages that 
support the PKK. Those are: Mirek, Reya, Taze, Elegez (Alagiaz), 
Shengani, Derik, Afshin, Suphan, Chumushvan, Senger, Amritaze in 
the Aragadz region; Barazh, Hako, Delto, Sorik, Kabaktepe, 
Tellik, Sichanli, Baysich in the Talin region; Ferik in the 
Echmiadzin region; and Shamran in the Ashtarak region (these 
names are given as published in CUMHURIYET).

  In January-September of the current year, national income 
comprised 71.6 percent of that for the corresponding period of 
last year; in the first quarter it comprised 50.6 percent, and 
over half-year--58.8 percent. 
  According to preliminary data, the population of the 
Republic 
of Armenia as of 1 October 1993 was 3,743,200 people. 
  In January-September 1993, 1,544,000 persons were engaged in 
the republic's economy, which constitutes a 0.6-percent decline 
as compared to the corresponding period of last year, including 
a 8.9 percent decline in the state sector. 
  As of 1 September 1993, 106,800 persons applied to, and were 
registered with, employment centers in search for jobs; of them, 
96.4 percent were not employed at the time. The status of 
unemployed was granted to 93.1 percent, or 95,900 persons. Since 
the beginning of the year the number of unemployed has increased 
by 34,100, or 55.2 percent, and as compared to September of last 
year--2.7-fold. Unemployment benefits were paid to 33,800 
persons, or 35.3 percent of the unemployed. Overall in the 
republic, the unemployment rate (the proportional share of 
unemployed in the total economically active population) in 
September stood at 5.8 percent, which constituted an increase of 
two percentage points as compared to January, and an increase of 
3.5 percentage points as compared to September 1992. 
  Over the period since the beginning of the year, 3,861 
persons found work with the help of employment services, 
including 564 persons in September. 
  According to reports, the average monthly wage of one worker 
employed in the state sector of the economy over the period of 
January-August 1993 amounted to 6,386 rubles [R] and increased 
as compared to the corresponding period of last year by a factor 
of 6.7; in August of the current year it amounted to R11,642 and 
increased as compared to January by a factor of 4.2, and as 
compared to July--by 11.2 percent.

Expenditures </H3>
  In January-August 1993, the profit of state enterprises and 
organizations (not counting agricultural enterprises, consumer 
cooperatives, and the State Insurance Company) amounted to 
R33.714 billion and had increased fivefold as compared to 
January-August of last year. 
  According to the data of the tax inspectorate as of 1 
October 
1993, revenues from taxes and levies amounted to R48.308 billion 
instead of envisaged R56.339 billion, or 85.7 percent.

<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  The Decree of the Government of the Republic of Armenia No. 
440, dated 31 August 1993, modified the state order with respect 
to capital construction for the current year envisaged to 
utilize R35.33 billion of state capital investment. Over 
January-September, R28.9757 billion of state capital investment 
was utilized, which amounts to 82.0 percent of the state order. 
  The volume of construction-election work performed amounted 
to R21.1681 billion, of which production facilities accounted 
for R5.3659 billion. State capital investment in production 
facilities amounted to R7.6741 billion, or 104.1 percent of the 
state order. 
  Enterprises and organizations utilized R4.2562 billion of 
capital investment from their own resources, of which production 
facilities accounted for R3.3674 billion. Construction-erection 
work accounted for R2.9233 billion and R2.3368 billion, 
respectively. 
  Utilization of capital investment envisaged by the state 
order for capital construction in the Republic of Armenia for 
1993 by national economic sectors is characterized by the 
following data (in current prices; million rubles):

  Technical retrofitting and reconstruction of functioning 
enterprises in January-September accounted for R1.9045 billion 
of state capital investment. 
  Capital assets worth R4.0086 billion were put into 
operation, 
including R1.1879 billion worth at production facilities. 
  In real terms, in January-September only 115,800 square 
meters of total (usable) housing area were put in operation 
(40.3 percent of the annual order), as well as general education 
schools for 5,523 pupils (63.2 percent), and preschool 
facilities for 370 children (72.5 percent). In addition, without 
the state order the executive committee of the Yerevan City 
Council put in operation preschool facilities for 320 children. 
  Through the use of personal means and state credits, 82,600 
square meters of usable housing space were built, as compared to 
105,900 built last year. 
  Of the total volume of capital investment in the earthquake 
zone, of R14.874 billion envisaged for the year, R11.9566 
billion, or 80.4 percent of the annual order, was utilized. 
  In the current year, it is envisaged to build in the 
disaster 
zone with state capital investment 202,700 square meters of 
general (actual living space) housing, general schools for 7,956 
pupils, preschool facilities for 510 children, outpatient 
facilities for 300 visits a shift, and a hospital with 50 beds. 
In January-September, the following were put in operation: 
102,600 square meters of general (actual living space) housing, 
or 50.6 percent of the state order; general education schools 
for 4,739 pupils, or 59.6 percent of state order; and preschool 
facilities for 370 children (72.5 percent). 
  The republic's construction organizations performed R37.7681 
billion worth of contract work, R33.4453 billion of which was 
with their own resources. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  In January-September 1993, 2.7552 million tonnes of cargo 
were transported, which amounted to only 19.2 percent of the 
volume transported in January-September 1992, including 0.7875 
million tonnes, or 33.7 percent, by rail and 1.924 million 
tonnes, or 16.0 percent, by automotive transport. Air transport 
accounted for 43,700 tonnes, which exceeds by a factor of 3.7 
the volume of shipping during the corresponding period of last 
year; as a result, the proportional share of air transport in 
the total volume of shipping in January-September 1993 comprised 
1.6 percent as compared to 0.1 percent during the corresponding 
period of last year. 
  In September 1993 freight transportation by general use 
transport increased as compared to August by 17.4 percent. 
  Passenger transportation in air travel in January-September 
1993 amounted to 847.8 million passenger-kilometers and declined 
as compared with the corresponding period of last year by 47.2 
percent; in September passenger transportation amounted to 101.0 
million passenger/km and declined as compared to August by 11.1 
percent. 
  Common carrier buses and shuttle taxicabs transported 58.0 
million persons, which is 60.1 percent less than over the 
corresponding period of last year. In September, 3.9 million 
persons were transported, which constituted a 40.9-percent 
decrease as compared to August. 
  There were 664 accidents involving moving stock at highways 
and streets over January-September of 1993, which was 36.8 
percent less than over the corresponding period of last year, 
and in which 225 persons died and 715 were wounded. 
  Income from main activities of communications enterprises 
over January-September 1993 in current prices amounted to 
R11.0313 billion, including R1.1347 billion from services to the 
population as compared to R668.8 million and R133.1 million over 
the corresponding period of last year. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  According to freight customs declarations, foreign trade 
turnover of the Republic of Armenia over nine months of 1993 
amounted to R134.2 billion (in current prices) or $137.9 million 
(conversion from rubles into dollars is made on the basis of the 
average monthly rate set by the Central Bank of the Republic of 
Armenia), of which R33.3 billion or $37.0 million was with 
foreign countries and R100.9 billion, or $100.9 million, with 
the countries of the former USSR, including R87.2 billion ($87.2 
million) with the CIS countries, of which a considerable 
part--R67.5 billion ($67.5 million), or 77.4 percent--was with 
Russia. The volume of exports over the past nine months amounted 
to R75.7 billion, or $77.3 million, and imports--R58.5 billion, 
or $60.6 million). The trade balance was positive in the amount 
of R17.2 billion, or $16.7 million. 
  In reality, taking into account fuels and electric power 
received through barter and clearing, as well as grain purchased 
with international credits and received as humanitarian aid, in 
the estimate of the State Administration for Statistics of the 
Republic of Armenia, foreign trade turnover over nine months of 
1993 amounted to R216.1 billion (in current prices) or $232.0 
million, of which R75.8 billion ($77.5 million) were exports and 
R140.3 billion ($154.5 million) were imports, and the trade 
balance was negative by R64.5 billion, or $77.0 million, 
including a negative trade balance of R24.3 billion or $30.5 
million with foreign countries, and R40.2 billion or $46.5 
million with the countries of former USSR. 
  Trade relations were carried out predominantly with Belgium, 
Iran, the United States, Cyprus, France, Russia, Ukraine, 
Turkmenistan, Georgia, and Kazakhstan. The Republic of Armenia 
had a positive trade balance with Belgium, Cyprus, Iran, France, 
and Ukraine, and a negative one with Russia and the United 
States. 
  Over the past nine months, the Republic of Armenia exported 
mainly measuring instruments, equipment, machines and 
mechanisms, textile and sundry goods, products of the chemical 
and related industries, precious stones, and metals and items 
made of them; it imported products of food processing industry, 
products of animal husbandry and plant-growing, and fuels and 
electric power. 
  As of 1 October 1993, 166 joint enterprises were registered 
in the republic. Investment of participating parties amounted to 
R216 million, $2.556 million, 300,000 French francs, and 10,000 
Austrian shillings. 
  According to the Customs Administration data, over 
January-September 1993 33,660 tonnes of cargo arrived in the 
Republic of Armenia as humanitarian aid, of which 20,692 tonnes 
were foodstuffs, 791 tonnes--medications and medical equipment, 
700 tonnes--potato seed, 5,664 tonnes--boiler oil, and 5,813 
tonnes--other cargo.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valter Shoniya, Russian ambassador to </F>
Azerbaijan, by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA staff correspondent Elmira 
Akhundova; place and date not given: "`I Did Not Receive 
Instructions on Whom To Place My Bets' Says Valter Shoniya, 
Russian Ambassador to Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] 
  [Akhundova] Valter Aleksandrovich, how would you evaluate 
the 
current status of bilateral relations between Azerbaijan and 
Russia? 
  [Shoniya] Recently, these relations have undergone not just 
substantial, but we might say fundamental changes. Mutual 
alienation, which at times prompted us to look at each other as 
virtual enemies, has disappeared. As early as October 1992, 
Azerbaijan and Russia signed a treaty that laid the legal 
foundation for relations of friendship and cooperation between 
the two sovereign states. However, it soon turned out that, 
putting it bluntly, they took this step for the sake of 
appearances. At present, the new Government of Azerbaijan is 
having to scrupulously restore everything that was so quickly 
and "expertly" destroyed at the previous stage. 
  [Akhundova] Do you blame only the Azeri side for severing 
relations? 
  [Shoniya] Perhaps some of the blame also devolves on Russia. 
However, there is a reason why they say: "Love cannot be 
compelled." The Russian leadership heard nothing but rebukes 
from the lips of the former leaders of Azerbaijan--this was 
still the same Soviet empire, it wanted yet again to "swallow 
up" Azerbaijan, strip it of its independence, and so on, and so 
forth. As I observed how anti-Russian sentiment was fueled in 
the society, I became convinced at the same time that this 
sentiment did not reflect public opinion. In this regard, a trip 
to Agdam shortly before its occupation became a particular 
revelation for me. As I socialized with common Azeris, I 
understood that these people have a very good attitude toward 
Russia and Russians. At the end of 1992 and the beginning of 
1993, I understood that some kind of change was coming. 
  [Akhundova] Leaders of the People's Front have a different 
point of view on this. They believe that in June 1993, a quite 
commonplace coup d'etat occurred in which the hand of Moscow 
clearly shines through. 
  [Shoniya] This is absolutely absurd. Russia strictly adhered 
to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of 
Azerbaijan. I speak in all sincerity: personally, I did not 
receive any instructions to support someone, to place my bets on 
someone, etc. 
  [Akhundova] Recently, representatives of the opposition have 
written that the admission of Azerbaijan to the CIS has failed 
to produce the desired results. The war in Karabakh goes on and, 
allegedly, will go on until Azerbaijan accepts all conditions 
set by Russia, the main condition being for Russian troops to 
return to the original lines in Azerbaijan. 
  [Shoniya] Nobody ever set such conditions for Azerbaijan 
when 
it joined the CIS. Besides, what kind of raising of the issue is 
this: we joined the CIS, but this accomplished nothing for us. 
Allow me to ask: What did the policy of the previous authorities 
accomplish for Azerbaijan--a policy of alienation from Russia, 
from other republics of the Commonwealth? Strained relations 
developed even between Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Did this 
policy accomplish anything for the people of Azerbaijan? 
  [Akhundova] Do you believe that the introduction of Russian 
troops to the zone of the Azeri-Armenian conflict under the 
aegis of peacekeeping forces could play a positive role? 
  [Shoniya] Russia will assume the burden of responsibility if 
the two sides ask it to. That is, if you want assistance we will 
provide it; if you do not want it, we are not going to impose 
ourselves; you sort it out yourselves. At times, we hear 
absolutely absurd assertions: Since the issue is not being 
resolved, it means that Russia is getting in the way in order to 
allegedly force Azerbaijan to make concessions. I beg your 
pardon, but it was Azeri troops that were defeated in Karabakh, 
and not Russia. The myth about military assistance allegedly 
being provided by Russia to Armenia is by now obvious to all. As 
far as the so-called "wild" assistance from mercenary 
adventurers is concerned, we are aware of the facts: Russians 
have also taken part in combat operations on the Azeri side. 
  [Akhundova] A few words about the most acute problems of the 
Russian-speaking population.... 
  [Shoniya] The seizure of apartments is one of the "painful" 
problems of the Russian-speaking population of the republic on 
which I indeed work thoroughly. A person leaves home for an hour 
or two, but when he returns he finds his apartment taken. In all 
of this, it is extremely difficult to evict those who have 
seized someone else's living space. Local authorities do 
nothing, make excuses, and some hide behind the refugee problem, 
which is altogether not noble. Refugees are the most pressing 
problem in Azerbaijan. However, it will not be solved by 
replacing one set of refugees with another. Numerous apartment 
seizures inflame and destabilize the situation in the republic. 
I understand that the rights of not just the Russian-speaking 
but also the indigenous population are being infringed upon. Can 
you imagine that Azeris sometimes approach me with complaints 
about the arbitrariness of the authorities? However, when 
interests of the Russian-speaking population are affected this 
assumes a different coloring, and a problem of daily life is 
frequently elevated to the level of an interethnic problem. 
  [Akhundova] You maintain continuous contacts with the 
Russian-speaking citizens of Azerbaijan. What is their mood at 
present? 
  [Shoniya] At a certain point, some kind of hopelessness 
appeared in the community of Russian-speaking residents, hence 
the mood of having their bags packed. Many left the republic 
literally with tears in their eyes. Azerbaijan is their 
motherland, the motherland of their fathers and grandfathers. 
The people became very hopeful following the change in the 
political situation in Azerbaijan. However, I am apprehensive 
about the feeling of hopelessness reemerging if the authorities 
fail to make timely and specific decisions concerning specific 
issues. 
  On occasion, the powers that be openly tell the people whose 
apartments have been seized: We will help to have your living 
space vacated, but for this or that amount of money. The people 
throw up their hands, lose hope, and head for the embassy to 
either file for citizenship or ask for assistance in leaving the 
confines of the republic. Therefore, the main point at present 
is to overcome the indifference and criminal negligence of local 
authorities because at the level of the government we find full 
support and mutual understanding. 
  [Akhundova] My last question: What are the prospects for 
state-to-state relations between Azerbaijan and Russia in the 
new year? 
  [Shoniya] They give us hope, but we will have to work very 
much and very hard. I would not be telling the truth if I said 
that I view state-to-state relations as divorced from the 
Karabakh problem--this festering wound on the body of your 
republic. The position of the Russian leadership is unambiguous: 
it advocates most resolutely the unconditional and unqualified 
return of all the seized territory. As far as Nagorno-Karabakh 
is concerned, the parties should find a mutually acceptable way 
to settle the conflict.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valerian Advadze, ambassador extraordinary </F>
and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Georgia to the Russian 
Federation, by I.M.; place and date not given: "Gamsakhurdia's 
Death"] 
  [Text] 
  [I.M.] The death of Zviad Gamsakhurdia is shrouded in 
mystery; rumors and different versions abound. Why has 
everything happened in such a strange way? Why did we learn 
about his death only several days later? 
  [Advadze] Because he himself lied all his life. And so his 
death also ended up wrapped in lies. 
  [I.M.] Did Gamsakhurdia's wife ask that he be buried in 
Tbilisi, on the territory of the estate? 
  [Advadze] I do not know. There were such reports in the 
Moscow press, but to the best of my knowledge nobody made such a 
request officially to the government of Georgia. Again, 
everything is on the level of rumors. The same rumors have it 
that Manana Gamsakhurdia allegedly said that she is afraid that 
his grave in Tbilisi would be defiled and therefore wants to 
move his body and rebury it in Groznyy. 
  [I.M.] This dragging the body from one grave to another 
resembles Abuladze's famous film. It looks as if the director 
had a tragic foresight regarding the future of his people. If 
Gamsakhurdia is indeed buried in Tbilisi, would it have any 
repercussions on the political situation? 
  [Advadze] No. The funeral may attract a crowd of gawkers and 
people who remain fanatical supporters even after what he has 
done to Mengrelia, after the fratricidal war he plunged Georgia 
into, after the rampage of his gangs. There are not too many 
people left, however, who would even die shouting "Zviad! 
Zviad!" and they will no longer be able to influence anything. 
The Georgian government learned of his death from Russian 
information, and this also says a great deal. First of all that 
his own confederates--the people who most likely did him in 
anyway--kept a lid on the news of his death. His entourage got 
tired of his whims and of the defeat. It appears that those who 
had been counting on coming back to power on his coattails, 
whose hopes were dashed, eventually disposed of him. 
  [I.M.] Which peculiarities in the popular psychology, in the 
nation's historic fate, was Gamsakhurdia able to exploit? 
  [Advadze] There are two kinds of nationalism. There is 
constructive nationalism, capable of taking a nation on the road 
of progress. This is the sense of national dignity. And there is 
an aggressive, animalistic, destructive one. It is the latter 
kind that Gamsakhurdia exploited, and, unfortunately, many fell 
for it, for the slogan "Georgia for Georgians!" One can find an 
explanation for it: when people over a period of two centuries 
are deprived of statehood, dream of it, and suddenly get a real 
opportunity to attain it, speculative ideas easily gain support. 
Time helps us see their real value. 
  As to the "recognized leadership," these figures--some say 
95, some say 87 percent--that constantly are being brought up 
with respect to his election as president, are also a complete 
lie. It was an unprecedented falsification. Ballots were 
switched, voting took place under submachine guns aimed at 
people, and many other things occurred. Even on the wave of the 
prevailing mood there could not be more than half of the 
population who would have voted for Gamsakhurdia. We, the Union 
of National Accord and Revival of Georgia, published a 
memorandum, "Democratic Elections: Myth and Reality," in the 
TBILISI newspaper on 20 April 1992, in which we proved that no 
democratic election could possibly take place, and that all the 
so-called data are a result of skillful falsification. On 5 May 
we reprinted it in SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA--the most popular 
newspaper in Georgia--and invited opponents to disprove our 
arguments. Nobody responded! Nobody! His one-year rule proved 
that both he and his Roundtable were simply incapable of running 
the state. Suffice it to recall the absurd economic policy--for 
instance, declaring an economic blockade of the USSR? Can you 
think of anything more stupid? And when he was already on the 
run, the entire campaign of civil disobedience, all the 
explosions, sabotage, the war against his own people? Who could 
still harbor any illusions? Then the march on Samtredia and 
Kutaisi--bringing with them foreign marauders, together with 
whom his "army" plundered, killed, and destroyed. 
  [I.M.] Some commentators--Yevgeniy Kiselev of "Itogi" among 
them--say that with Gamsakhurdia dead, the idea of, so to say, 
an official opposition on which much could be blamed also died, 
and now Shevardnadze will have to deal with a real and strong 
opposition in the parliament, which has its own score to settle 
with the authorities. 
  [Advadze] The current parliamentary opposition has long lost 
its "Gamsakhurdia" colors. Many of them retain, however, what I 
would call a "Roundtable" mentality: anti-Russian leanings; 
rejection of the idea of joining the CIS; the hope that the West 
will show concern over the fate of Georgia, despite the fact 
that the West is in no hurry to open its arms to us--or to 
Russia for that matter. I think that to a certain extent this 
opposition can be explained by the desire to stand apart, to 
"shine" in the public background, to not get lost. Most of the 
time their complaints about the authorities are vague, their 
proposals not thought-through, and they still do not have any 
idea how the economy functions and why we need ties with Russia. 
This is not serious. For instance, Natadze, chairman of the 
parliament's commission on defense and security, says we should 
declare a war on Russia over Abkhazia and that we could even win 
it. 
  [I.M.] There was this funny Georgian joke about Guria 
deciding to declare a war on China, and how the next morning all 
the women in the little Guria put on their mourning clothes and 
got ready to bury a billion Chinese. It is frightening when a 
joke holds the threat of becoming a tragedy. That the tragedy is 
real, that the situation is unstable, one can see from the 
constant clashes taking place, for instance, in Tbilisi. 
  [Advadze] These are clashes between mafia groups who are 
dividing the spheres of influence and redistributing profits. To 
call things by their proper names, this is rampant gangsterism. 
We have to put an end to this runaway gangsterism, plundering 
and violence against the civilian population. 
  [I.M.] How? 
  [Advadze] By force. 
  [I.M.] The army? 
  [Advadze] The army. But a hired one. Since a Georgian 
militiaman finds it difficult to shoot a Georgian gangster, and 
since everybody is armed to the teeth, we have to invite those 
who will be able to bring it under control. 
  [I.M.] The Russian Army, for instance? 
  [Advadze] The Russian military, but on a contract basis. 
This 
is not the Russian Army. 
  [I.M.] But this will only complicate relations between 
Russians and Georgians inside the country. 
  [Advadze] No. If they work on contract, and on top of that 
in 
tandem with the Georgian militia or army, this is normal. 
  [I.M.] A new round of negotiations has begun in Geneva. What 
is your forecast? 
  [Advadze] I do not expect anything to come of it. The 
Abkhazian side behaves like the winner; they are intent on 
attaining Abkhazian independence. The world community--and not 
even the world community, but specifically Russia--can stop 
them. Russia must openly recognize the territorial integrity of 
Georgia and demand the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. 
But Russia is still behaving in a vague manner. Actually, it is 
difficult to demand a firm position of Russia right now, and I 
understand this. And while everybody is vacillating and 
negotiating, the Georgian population in Abkhazia is being 
literally exterminated in the physical sense. True genocide. 
  [I.M.] Georgia is not going to reconcile to the loss of 
Abkhazia. Does this mean war? 
  [Advadze] There is a political solution to this problem. The 
key to it is in the hands of Moscow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ye. Gaydar, first deputy chairman of the </F>
Government of Russia, by Tatyana Korostikova; place and date not 
given: "What Will They Berate the Authorities For in the New 
Year: Ye. Gaydar's Departure Facilitated an Abrupt Fall of the 
Exchange Rate of the Ruble"] 
  [Text] This was the last interview which Ye. Gaydar 
gave to ARGUMENTY I FAKTY before resigning from the position of 
first deputy prime minister. However, he has not given up his 
reformist plans, which he intends to implement in the position 
of chairman of the Russia's Choice faction in the State 
Duma. 
  [Korostikova] What will Russians have to go through in 1994? 
  [Gaydar] The perception of an ordinary person is always much 
more critically disposed toward what is happening than a 
detached, remote historical assessment. This is why events 
should not be measured by whether they will praise or berate the 
authorities (of course, it will be the latter), but rather what 
they will berate the authorities for. 
  If they berate the authorities for: 
  --prices still growing, although the rate of inflation has 
dropped; 
  --there being goods in the stores, but us being nowhere 
close 
to Warsaw yet, to say nothing of Brussels; 
  --the problem of employment becoming more acute; 
  --having to restructure production and master new products 
with some difficulty; 
  --the peasants having difficulty selling their products 
because of growing competition, 
  this will mean that the authorities are moving in the 
right direction. 
  If they berate the authorities for: 
  --there being no goods at any price; 
  --money being worthless again; 
  --the ruble once again depreciating quickly against the 
dollar; 
  --not being able to save money in rubles and having to 
convert the money into dollars; 
  --the above being impossible to do because strict procedures 
for currency operations have been introduced; 
  --no one filling state requisitions, despite their 
reintroduction, 
  this will mean that the authorities are advancing along 
a dangerous path. 
  In December we had a 12-percent inflation rate (the target 
was 5-7 percent by the end of the year). This is why the 
inflation control measures we have planned for 1994 do not 
appear explosive to me. To be sure, we will have to pay for such 
a monetary policy by a harsher reduction in the output of 
uncompetitive products, but no unthinkable growth of 
unemployment is expected, at least not in 1994. Unemployment 
will increase gradually. Here is the experience of Estonia and 
Latvia: at present, prices are growing there at the rate of less 
than 1 percent per month, whereas unemployment does not go into 
dozens of percentage points; it is the same as here. 
  [Korostikova] Yegor Timurovich, you are talking about 
everything as if the Duma will not restrict the reformers in 
anything. Compared to the Duma, the old parliament might seem a 
cherished dream. 
  [Gaydar] No, the old parliament was no cherished dream. I 
will remind you that in September we had a harsh conflict 
between the parliament and the president; everything was moving 
toward a political crisis. All edicts of the president were 
immediately canceled. There was no budget for the fourth 
quarter. A power vacuum emerged in the regions because all the 
decisions of the center were torpedoed by the other branch of 
power. In general, the power structure in Russia was paralyzed. 
  [Korostikova] Indeed, but at the time you had the 
use-of-force scenario to fall back on, and now you do not. 
  [Gaydar] There is the constitution instead, which 
establishes 
the natural framework for the separation of powers, which 
previously was not the case. 
  Of course, we (Russia's Choice) are a minority in the 
parliament; however, with the help of the president's veto we 
will be able to block the adoption of the most irresponsible 
decisions that pose a danger to the country. 
  [Korostikova] What is the threat to Russian consumers from 
new customs tariffs on imports? There was panic in Moscow before 
New Year's day; they swept away even the most expensive 
merchandise sold for foreign exchange. 
  [Gaydar] The adoption of new import tariffs has been 
postponed until March. The tariffs need additional work. New 
import duties should restrict imports we do not need, but they 
should not be prohibitive in nature. 
  [Korostikova] Will they restrict imports of foodstuffs, too? 
  [Gaydar] Why should we, unlike all other countries of the 
world, fail to protect our own agriculture? The issue is 
different: To what extent should these duties be introduced, and 
at what levels? The position of the agrarians, headed by 
Zaveryukha, is: make the tariffs prohibitive, so that they will 
teach everyone a lesson about importing anything at all to our 
country. A majority of other ministries and departments advocate 
a different point of view: tariffs should be made normal, that 
is, presupposing a certain revenue for the budget and elementary 
protections for domestic agricultural production, but by no 
means prohibitive. 
  No matter what import duties are adopted, they will not 
apply 
to goods from CIS countries. We have signed free trade treaties 
with them. This means an enormous amount of foodstuffs. 
  [Korostikova] Will there be any assistance for the producers 
of goods that are needed? 
  [Gaydar] Several substantial preferences for them are found 
in the Edict on Taxation which was recently signed by the 
president. For example, if a small enterprise engages in a 
priority type of activity, its profit tax will be reduced. Tax 
relief will be provided for the profits of banks from long-term 
credit extended for investment purposes. 
  Restructuring of the system of state support for the 
investment activities of enterprises is planned. Money will not 
be given for nothing to those who have managed to get through to 
the necessary office, but rather to support promising projects 
through either credit guarantees, stock purchases, or 
supplemental state financing, in addition to internal and 
private investment, and so on. The Ministry of the Economy has 
already developed such a concept.

<F P=106> [Press conference given by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy reported by </F>
Radmir Kilmatov: "Yavlinskiy Suggested That the Dollar's 
Exchange Rate be Increased"] 
  [Text] At his press conference yesterday, Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy, people's deputy and head of the EPItsentr [Center 
for Economic and Political Research], provided an assessment of 
the current economic situation in Russia and the new composition 
of the cabinet. He said the government does not have a program 
and will not be able to overcome the crisis. Yavlinskiy said he 
has such a program himself, and one of its elements is the 
establishment of "a real dollar exchange rate." 
  In Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's estimation, the current situation 
is 
characterized by the practically complete lack of investments in 
1993, the danger of granting preferential loans and budgetary 
investments in 1994 ("the temptation is very great to become a 
good and kind government"), the continuing production recession, 
and by the dollar's exchange rate being held back by the 
government when prices are rising (in the EPItsentr head's 
opinion, the real exchange rate is 3,000 rubles to the dollar at 
present). 
  In Yavlinskiy's opinion, there is "a vast inflationary 
spring" of unpaid debts to farmers, the VPK [military industrial 
complex], and budgetary organizations in the economy today (in 
the view of the EPItsentr, the total indebtedness amounts to 5 
percent of GNP). The attempt to resolve the problem of 
nonpayments by credit methods led to the point that vast amounts 
of credit funds did not reach the enterprises and "accumulated 
in commercial banks," which engaged in conversion, as a result 
of which $20 billion went abroad. A new negative factor has made 
its appearance--"collectivization of industry," as the result of 
40 percent of the property being turned over to labor 
collectives in the privatization. 
  The government personnel approved by the president's edict 
yesterday cannot solve Russia's economic problems, in 
Yavlinskiy's opinion, inasmuch as it is "a typical government of 
the Silayev type" which has no program ("only Chubays will be 
working until the last voucher"). "We do not know whether it 
visualizes the current situation in the economy or not," 
Yavlinskiy said, noting that the entire concept of government 
must be changed, transformed from a sectorial concept into one 
which takes the federal system of Russia into account. 
  In Yavlinskiy's opinion, the scenario for economic 
development in 1994 under the current government will be as 
follows: in the first quarter, inflation wil reach 30 percent 
monthly and the ruble's exchange rate will fall faster than 
prices rise. A critical point will be in the spring, when the 
production recession will reach 50 percent of the 1989 level and 
inflation will increase even further because of the money added 
in the first quarter; as a result of state purchases and the 
rise in prices for energy resources, the budget deficit will 
increase sharply. The summer should be comparatively stable, 
since "the main recession will be under way already." The 
EPItsentr manager is very concerned about months in the fall, 
since "the risk of losing control over inflation, which may 
exceed 50 percent per month, will increase." 
  Yavlinskiy said he has his own program, which will make it 
possible to hold inflation at the level of 20 percent monthly. 
He said increasing the dollar's exchange rate "to the real rate" 
is a top priority in such a program. In conformity with this 
program, the government should assume responsibility for the 
dynamics of the exchange rate--for example, by concluding 
transactions in futures, compensating for fluctuations in the 
exchange rate. The government should also reject any forms of 
preferential credit and subsidization and put an end to trade 
with import credits in the currency market. Institutional 
changes in the structure of the economic system and a structural 
and technological industrial policy are among the program's 
measures requiring prompt attention.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Arifdzhanov: "Economic Advisers of the </F>
Gorbachev Era Offer Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin the New Life 
Old-Style"] 
  [Text] Venerable academicains have just completed work on 
the new approaches to the socioeconomic transformations in 
Russia. IZVESTIYA was first to obtain a copy of this bulky 
report prepared by the Academy of Sciences' economics department 
and the international foundation, Reform. 
  Ten of the most well-known economists gathered around the 
same table to work on this document in the final stage. We have 
highlighted three of them solely because Stanislav Shatalin was 
director of this work, while Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov 
were recently named chief advisers to a government which is 
renewing its course. There was even talk of instructing first 
deputy chairman Oleg Soskovets to draw up a program of essential 
changes. 
  Nevertheless, Stanislav Shatalin told your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent that the notion of a special "Abalkin-Petrakov" 
program is a myth. All that they have to offer the government 
is this report and it is this joint document which is now lying 
before the president, the chairman of the government, and the 
deputies in the Federal Assembly. Well, we are reading this 
undoubtedly interesting work slightly earlier than the president 
and all the rest. 
  We shall omit the detailed criticism of Gaydar's reform. It 
was voiced fairly often when the reform was being implemented 
and its opponents became even more active after the retirement 
of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov. The Shatalin team's main 
conclusion is this: The scale of the present crisis, which has 
increased as a result of shock therapy, and its internal 
structure are having an extremely dire effect on the solution of 
social tasks and threaten the irreversible destruction of the 
country's economic, scientific, and technical potential. 
  After expressing the ritualistic criticism of the 
monetarists, and moreover expressed in sometimes well argued 
criticism, the academicians move onto the basic principles of 
the development of their strategy. There are six. To summarize 
briefly, first there is the "definition of the social indicators 
of the reform" -- a guaranteed subsistence minimum, an 
employment threshhold, the proportion of expenditure on 
education, health care, and so forth -- limits which may not be 
exceeded under any circumstances or for any reason. 
  Second, they are demanding the abandonment of the "naive 
belief in the automatic improvement of the economy by impersonal 
monetarism" and demand the restoration of state regulation. 
Material production must be supported, the competitiveness of 
Russian goods must be increased, and reliable economic 
legislation must be adopted. 
  The third principle is financial stabilization. How? The 
measures include the mobilization of domestic sources of 
accumulation using the population's money savings. While 
proclaiming a rigid financial and credit policy, the 
academicians nevertheless believe that the priority spheres and 
production units must be supported. They propose the regulation 
of prices and incomes. And so forth. 
  The fourth principle is the guideline toward the single 
Russian market. But here they utter the traditional phrase 
about switching the focus of the reform "from the center to the 
regions." 
  Fifth. Reliance on one's own efforts. A reappraisal of the 
role of foreign aid. We will cope by ourselves. 
  Sixth and last. The transformation of the relations of 
ownership. This is the main area. Every form of ownership, and 
that includes state ownership, must have an owner. The economy 
is multi-tiered. Attracting investments is the main criterion 
in the decision on privatization. Switching the focus from the 
privatization of property to the privatization of management 
(eternal glory to the directors!). And a sweeping blow: the 
"consistent curtailment of voucher-based privatization as a 
populist measure, which is incapable of resolving the problem of 
social injustice but can intensify the rise in inflation and the 
collapse of the production potential." The old guys know how to 
swear eruditely. 
  There are three stages to the "new" reform. In the first 2-3 
years we will achieve stabilization. We will stop the slump in 
production and reduce the rate of inflation. We will highlight 
the "crucial areas" (housing, food, and medicines) and place the 
emphasis on them. In stage two -- 10 years -- we will embark on 
the structural reorganization of the economy. We will achieve 
the pre-crisis volume of gross product and ease the 
stratification of property so that in the third stage we can 
join the ranks of the world's economic leaders. 
  But that is in the future. In the first half of this year it 
is planned to settle all the wage debts. To establish in 
legislation a subsistence minimum and within a year raise the 
minimum wage to that level. 
  "But that means the money supply," I said to Shatalin, "it 
means increasing the money supply again. " "Yes, it means the 
money supply," the academician agreed, "which in its pure form 
leads to a rise in inflation. But if the extra money leads to a 
growth in production and extra goods, this will reduce 
inflation. You have to do your calculations. That is what I 
told Boris Fedorov -- you have to do your calculations." 
  The authors of the report argued among themselves most about 
prices and customs policy and the attitude toward hard 
currencies. This is how it turned out in the end. 
  The liberalization of prices, first and foremost prices for 
energy resources, can only restrict the market and lead to a new 
spiral of inflation, a further slump in production, and the 
collapse of whole sectors if the commodity producers retain 
their monopoly, the authors believe. This means that it is 
necessary to use the traditional stabilization measures. In 
other words, to regulate prices. The sequence goes like this -- 
first prices for certain raw materials and transport charges are 
fixed. The state pays the debt to the sectors. Then within the 
framework of this set of measures the ratio between prices and 
pay levels are normalized by agreement. Prices will be indexed 
by means of special funds created from tax receipts from 
above-norm profits. This tax will be paid by those who sell 
output at deregulated prices. The aim is that a certain 
rational correlation of prices will be fixed initially using 
administrative measures and then within a few months an entire 
system of economic regulators will be built to "underpin" these 
correlations. 
  The academicians' dream is that inflation will then be 
around 
3-5 percent. As a consumer of their economic plans I can 
foresee empty shelves in the stores. Just like before. Empty 
shelves will be the result of the proposed principle of the 
protectionism of this country's producers primarily through a 
customs import tariff. The course aimed at the convertibility 
of the ruble is acknowledged to be long-term and is effectively 
postponed indefinitely. But the task right now is to regulate 
the system of the internal convertibility of the ruble. The 
auction rate ceases to be official. The Central Bank fixes the 
price of the dollar. 
  After that it is like it used to be in the old days. The 
course of the reintegration of the former republics of the USSR, 
although, admittedly, on the basis of national currencies. The 
restoration of the manageability of the economy. That is, the 
direct management of state enterprises. State control of the 
process of privatization. The appointment of leaders. The 
participation of local organs in the direction of joint-stock 
and holding companies. "It can no longer be tolerated that 
ministries and departments are removed from the processes of the 
reform of enterprises.. from influencing the consumer market".... 
  Shatalin himself admitted honestly: He knows how things must 
not be done but he only half knows how things ought to be done. 
Nevertheless, instead of surgical intervention, the ailing 
economy is being offered the old, tried and tested medicines 
whose effectiveness is only half guaranteed. 
  The point, it seems to us, is not whether the prescriptions 
are old. The point is that even if you wrap them in a new 
package, they passed their use-by date long ago.

<F P=106> [Declaration of Russian Commodity Producers, adopted by the </F>
Congress of Representatives of Members of the Federation of 
Public Associations of Russian Commodity Producers: "Plow, But 
Without Seeming To"] 
  [Text] For some reason, this event was left unnoted by most 
of the newspapers. Essentially, only PRAVDA and NEZAVISIMAYA 
spoke out fully and sincerely about this congress. After all, 
the congress, held in Krasnoyarsk, was a meeting of virtually 
all the workers in Russia -- directors of the country's 
industrial enterprises, who were tired of the fact that some, 
pardon the term, condom dealer was living better than the 
Worker, the Plowman or the Laborer. 
  PRAVDA has already written about the sort of congress this 
was. About 300 directors of enterprises from 43 regional 
organizations and 8 federal unions, headed by Yuriy Skokov, 
decided how things were to be and how to go on living. 
  Today we are publishing the DECLARATION on the rights of 
Russian commodity producers, adopted at this congress. With 
respect to its style, perhaps, this document looks conventional. 
Essentially, though, it is a cry, an SOS shout, a powerful voice 
in defense of the workers of our land. 
  Commodity producers, managers (directors) and entrepreneurs 
-- everyone who is employed in the sphere of commodity 
production, regardless of the form of ownership, type of 
economic activity and political orientation, stated: 
  The chosen model of radical economic reforms in Russia has 
led to a progressing recession in commodity production and the 
growth of the crisis. No consideration is made of the fact that 
the entire infrastructure of the country's industrial, 
technological and scientific-technical potential has formed 
under conditions different in principle, and that a transitional 
period is needed to adapt to a truly market milieu. The main 
goal of the reforms -- raising the people's standard of living 
-- has been sacrificed. 
  The Federation comes out in favor of carrying out reforms, 
and sets its goal as achieving the recognition and protection of 
the rights of commodity producers on the basis of 
self-organization and coordination of their interests in the 
process of reforming the economy. 
  THE FEDERATION OF COMMODITY PRODUCERS, AWARE OF ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY AND SOCIETY, PROCLAIMS: 
  --its right to conclude a general agreement with the 
Government of the Russian Federation that secures a 
qualitatively new system of mutual relations in the 
implementation of economic reforms, for the purpose of creating 
efficient commodity production; 
  --its right to draw up and sign, in the shortest time 
possible, regional agreements with the organs of state authority 
of the subjects of the Russian Federation, on working out the 
optimal mutually acceptable mechanisms for carrying out economic 
reforms in the provinces; 
  --its right to participate in the drawing up of all 
legislative and normative acts pertaining to commodity 
production, and to submit them for the consideration of the 
Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and other organs of 
state authority, in accordance with existing legislation; 
  --its right to state guarantee of protection of the vitally 
important interests of commodity producers as a necessary 
condition for preserving and strengthening Russia. The state's 
attempt to evade solving the problems of supporting domestic 
commodity production is inadmissible; 
  --its right to state guarantee of the priorities of domestic 
commodity producers in the process of privatization. We are 
against hasty redistribution of the national wealth, to the 
detriment of the interests of the overwhelming majority of the 
population; 
  --its right to a long-term state protectionist policy in the 
interests of domestic commodity producers. We are for Russia's 
active entry into the world market in the interests of the 
national economy, but we are against turning our Motherland into 
a raw-materials appendage of the developed countries; 
  --its right to participate in the creation of a complete 
system of social protection of commodity producers. 
  The Federation will try to vindicate and protect the rights 
of domestic commodity producers within the framework of existing 
legislation in interaction and cooperation with the organs of 
federal and regional authority and administration and with all 
the domestic organizations and movements which express the 
interests of business circles and work collectives.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov: "Nonmonetary Jugglers"] </F>
  [Text] The "group of experts" formed under First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets is planning to refute one of the basic 
postulates of current macroeconomic theory, which establishes a 
strict functional and cause-and-effect relationship between the 
size of a monetary emission and the rates at which prices 
increase. 
  The former specialists in "the dialectics of socialism" and 
"optimum planning" have declared their readiness to carry out 
the prime minister's directive on "adjustment of the course of 
economic reforms" and to curb inflation by "primarily 
nonmonetary methods." 
  It is no coincidence that the strange combination of words 
(similar to "fighting a fire by nonfire methods," "rescuing 
someone who is drowning by not pulling him out of the water," 
and the like) has become part of the vocabulary of Council of 
Ministers officials. A common economic dilemma for any country's 
government--inflation or a production recession 
(unemployment)--has become exacerbated to the limit because of 
the extremely deformed structure of the economy and the absence 
of developed market institutions. 
  For this reason, it is still impossible for the voters to be 
pleased by the good condition of even one of the two key 
macroeconomic parameters. Everything that was accomplished in 
1993 was to lower inflation by one-third (to 900 percent 
annually) and slow the rate of recession by a factor of 1.7 (to 
11 percent). However, the voter, like the president and his 
prime minister and the financial institutions, has not finished 
and wants to see a global result right away. 
  And those who want to meet all the voters' demands at once 
(the hypnotists, lawyers, academicians, and those who are simply 
crazy) make their appearance right away. While the first two 
categories of political illusionists received a vote of 
confidence in the 12 December elections, the academicians' hour 
of triumph came during the government crisis in mid-January. 
  There is no question that statements by the "group of 
experts," which promises to cope with both the recession and 
inflation right away, are aimed at pleasing the premier, who is 
naturally worried to death about both problems. The guarantees 
are being given by persons who are quite reliable--the 
academicians. It is unlikely that they will really be lying. 
  However, the premier would not have become the head of the 
government if he had not learned from his own mistakes and been 
insured against possible political traps. Viktor Chernomyrdin is 
well aware what the first attempt to make use of the services of 
the "reputable" economist Leonard Vid cost him. After the 
former deputy chairman of the USSR Gosplan [State Planning 
Committee] provided Mr. Chernomyrdin with his written concept of 
the reform, the press accused the prime minister of attempts to 
revive the system of directive management of the economy. Mr. 
Vid disappeared completely from the political scene as a result 
of the economic experiment in the spring. 
  This time, Viktor Chernomyrdin is being cautious, and "the 
experts" have been attached to his first deputy, who will assume 
full responsibility for the work's unavoidable failures. It has 
also not been ruled out that the government order to the 
academicians is a budgeted grant for the economic NII 
[scientific research institutes], which are at death's door and 
whose staffs are comparable with the work force of associates in 
large corporations. However, regardless of the true motives for 
enlisting the services of these persons in the Council of 
Ministers or how long they are held in the White House, the 
damage inflicted on the Russian economy by the use of 
"nonmonetary methods" will be enormous. After all, each 
"nonmonetary" day will cost the country the inflation, measured 
in percentages that are entirely monetary, which is being 
generated by the increased productivity of the printing press.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Bobkov, chairman of the Central Committee </F>
of the "Trade Unity" Trade Union: "The Course: Transformations 
and Reforming"] 
  [Text] To work so that every trade-union member is 
convinced: professionals sincerely devoted to their jobs and 
capable of protecting the economic, social, and labor rights of 
their members work in our trade union. 
  However, I will not hide the fact that every forward step 
will not come easy. The plenum took the course of reforming the 
entire activity of the trade union, determining the basic 
directions in reform: personnel, organizational structure, 
social partnership, receipt and use of membership dues, and 
information support. Therefore, we will have to work, as the 
saying goes, rolling up our sleeves and not complaining about 
difficulties. Everyone will have to work--from the chairman of 
the trade-union central committee to the chairman of a republic, 
kray, and oblast trade-union committee and of a primary 
trade-union organization. 
  The plenum of the trade-union central committee did not 
become an ordinary event held according to the traditional 
scheme. In my opinion, the speeches by my colleagues are 
interesting and their thoughts and deeds are not standard. 
  The following is the plenum's special feature: having given 
recommendations and having adopted decisions, the plenum--and 
this is the basic thing--developed the mechanism of reforming 
and the principles of transforming and changing trade-union 
activity. The plenum also gave the following advice: to work 
more actively with government structures, using only a 
constructive and reasoned dialogue. Applying this form of mutual 
relations, we have already solved a number of problems in favor 
of the sector's workers. I will recall the recent one: jointly 
with Russia's State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property an agreement on principles of interaction under 
privatization was signed. What does this document give? First of 
all, it makes it possible to more efficiently protect the 
interests of labor collectives against arbitrary decisions of 
the local administration and regional committees on property and 
to carry out privatization on the basis of law and order. You 
will agree that this is not all that little. 
  The following opinion has existed since time immemorial: 
there is a central apparatus, let it think. And if something is 
amiss in the trade union, it will be made responsible for this. 
The plenum posed the question differently. In no way relieving 
the trade-union central committee of responsibility for work on 
protecting the interests and rights of trade-union members at 
the federal level, the plenum, proceeding from the objectively 
existing situation, considered it necessary to increase the 
responsibility of republic, kray, and oblast committees in the 
solution of socioeconomic problems affecting the vital interests 
of workers in regions and in the establishment of an equitable 
system of social partnership. 
  Is this necessary? Yes. I will say openly: the sector does 
not have an efficiently operating system of social partnership. 
  An analysis shows that at almost every second enterprise 
collective contracts are drawn up formally, almost one-half of 
our workers do not know at all that at present the collective 
contract is the only legal form of collective regulation of 
mutual relations between entrepreneurs and workers at 
enterprises, and only 10 percent of the workers effectively 
realize their rights through collective contracts. Statistics on 
territorial and sectorial agreements are also distressing. They 
were concluded in only 10 regions! What did the plenum decide? 
What life itself and the interests of trade workers demand under 
market conditions: in 1994 it is necessary to regulate relations 
and social guarantees through collective contracts of 
enterprises and to ensure the signing of territorial tripartite 
agreements. A complex task? It is not simple, but we must 
accomplish it in order to serve our purpose. 
  The trade-union central committee made proposals for the 
general agreement for 1994 concluded among the government, 
trade-union associations, and Russia's entrepreneurs. All of 
them were examined and taken into account. The composition of 
the Russian Tripartite Commission was formed. More than 70 
all-Russian trade unions and associations have formed the 
trade-union unit of the Russian Tripartite Commission out of 28 
trade-union leaders. It also includes a representative of our 
trade union. 
  What is my forecast? Work in the commission will make it 
possible to raise our problems before the government and to seek 
ways of solving them. 
  The plenum also approved the position of the trade-union 
central committee with respect to elections to the State Duma. I 
will recall that we not only actively supported the political 
movement "Russia's Women" during the preelection campaign, but 
also concluded an agreement on cooperation. Today candidates for 
deputies from the movement "Russia's Women" have received more 
than 20 mandates. A working meeting with the leaders of this 
movement--A. Fedulova and Ye. Lakhova--was held. The principles 
of our relations were refined and a program of actions was 
outlined at it. 
  The plenum also made the following conclusion: the trade 
union will be able to operate only if it is strong financially. 
What must be done for this? First of all, it is necessary to 
reform the entire system of collection and expenditure of 
trade-union dues and to create financial stability from the 
primary trade-union organization to the trade-union central 
committee, concentrating the bulk of the funds at the 
territorial and sectorial level in special trade-union funds. If 
we do not do this, we will be doomed. Of course, the essence of 
the problem lies in how to do this. It is impossible to ignore 
the settled traditional view of the role of the trade union as 
an organization where one can receive some social and material 
benefits (passes, places in children's preschool institutions, 
and so forth). Such an attitude toward trade unions is not 
speculative. Not long ago about 60 percent of the members 
confirmed it when they were questioned at the Moscow Oblast 
Regional Trade Union of Trade Workers. It is impossible not to 
take this into consideration, as well as the fact that the 
financial situation in the trade union is critical. Many primary 
organizations have not developed a system of monthly collection 
of membership dues and of control over the completeness of 
collection with due regard for the total income of trade-union 
members and spend trade-union funds inefficiently. The 
possibility of receiving income from the deposit of temporarily 
free balances of monetary assets in banks is not utilized. There 
are numerous cases (especially where chairmen are not exempt 
from primary jobs) of delay by the administration in deductions 
of dues and their use for economic needs. Many primary 
organizations transfer part of the funds to republic, kray, and 
oblast trade-union committees irregularly and, moreover, not in 
a full volume. 
  The plenum determined the basic directions in the 
strengthening of the trade union's financial stability--rise in 
the level of organizational work and permanent control over the 
course of collection of membership dues and over prompt 
deductions into trade-union committees. Gradually, while 
constantly informing primary organizations of the results 
attained by the trade union with respect to the protection of 
workers' interests, to strive for the redistribution of funds 
between the primary organization and oblast, kray, and republic 
trade-union committees. 
  Are we on the correct path? The plenum answered: Yes! Today 
there is no other path. 
  Under market conditions the role of the trade union is 
changing fundamentally. A new financial policy should correspond 
to this change. Now finances are needed not so much in order to 
provide assistance to primary organizations for conducting all 
kinds of cultural activities (although this is important in 
itself) as to train trade-union workers, to establish a strong 
legal and economic service, and to form special funds. 
  The plenum approved the practice of a number of trade-union 
committees, which use the collective insurance of trade-union 
members at the expense of part of the trade-union dues for the 
establishment of a real mechanism for their social protection, 
redistribution of trade-union dues, and increase in the 
motivation for membership in the trade union. Among the reform 
paths of development of the trade union, for the purpose of 
increasing the mutual responsibility of primary trade-union 
organizations, republic, kray, and oblast trade-union 
committees, and the trade-union central committee for the 
fulfillment of statutory requirements, the plenum considered it 
useful to change over to a system of contractual relations. The 
trade-union central committee worked out and sent a draft 
contract on mutual relations to all trade-union 
committees--membership organizations. 
  The establishment of a single information field is one of 
the 
basic directions in reform. It is extremely important that the 
trade-union aktiv and every trade-union member know their rights 
and the forms and methods of protecting their interests. For 
these purposes a plan of publications by specialists of the 
trade-union central committee was worked out. TORGOVAYA GAZETA 
constantly acquaints you with their materials. The issue of an 
information bulletin of the trade-union central 
committee--TORGOVOYE YEDINSTVO [TRADE UNITY]--was organized. The 
issue of our first number--GOLOS PROFSOYUZA [VOICE OF THE TRADE 
UNION]--was prepared. 
  Will we fulfill what has been envisaged? I am confident that 
we will, if in the new year we work a great deal and with 
efficiency. It is impossible otherwise. Trade, public catering, 
consumer cooperative, and entrepreneurship workers must have a 
strong authoritative trade union. Our duty is to justify their 
trust.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Gorodetskaya under the rubric </F>
"Projections"; based on reports by INTERFAX and POSTFACTUM: 
"Experts Believe That the Ruble Will Fall Still Lower, but 
Because of the Council of Ministers Rather Than Gaydar"] 
  [Text] Sergey Pavlenko, first deputy chief of the working 
center for economic reforms of the Russian Federation 
Government, believes that Gaydar's resignation may certainly be 
viewed as "a prologue to a general retreat from the course of 
the reform and a transition to forming a `Soviet Government.'" 
However, on the other hand, Mr. Pavlenko believes that the 
departure of the first prime minister will "bring to the surface 
the polarization of forces that exists within the government, 
and will make the government more controllable--through the 
parliament, through political pressure." Nonetheless, as Mr. 
Pavlenko states, the fact of Gaydar's resignation will entail a 
new cycle of inflation in any event, and the exchange rate of 
the dollar will increase to 3,500-5,000 rubles [R] or perhaps 
more. In his opinion, there are no financial causes for 
inflation; it has been caused by "the mood of panic among 
small-, medium-, and a proportion of large-scale entrepreneurs, 
and in commercial structures" in conjunction with the departure 
of Yegor Gaydar and general political instability. 
  In the opinion of Sergey Pavlenko, the departure of Yegor 
Gaydar from the Cabinet of Ministers and the expected 
resignation of Boris Fedorov, who attempted to pursue a firm 
financial policy and came out in favor of reducing state 
subsidies to industry, the military-industrial complex, etc., 
means that inflation will not be contained successfully because, 
to this end, members of the government "must have personal 
courage and not be members of the social group of industry 
managers, but rather be a separate political force." In his 
opinion, there are no such people among the expected new members 
of the cabinet. Besides, at present "it is not even the change 
of government that poses the greatest danger, but rather its 
passivity in the environment of cadre and geographical 
movements. At present, officials are not working, but rather 
battling over slots in the new government building, the White 
House," said the first deputy chief of the working center for 
economic reforms. 
  In general, Sergey Pavlenko thinks that an enhancement of 
the 
reform is out of the question in the immediate future; the main 
task is "to hold on to what has been accomplished by Gaydar, in 
particular, to prevent the redistribution of property and 
hyperinflation." 
  Meanwhile, a highly placed government expert who did not 
wish 
to be identified stated that a sharp drop in the exchange rate 
of the national currency is not due to Gaydar's resignation at 
all because the rate of inflation in 1994 was preordained by 
decisions of the Russian Federation Government, made in November 
and December 1993, concerning the almost twofold increase in 
salaries for the employees of the budget-financed sector, the 
payment of budget arrears on social programs going into 
billions, and the allocation of subsidies to the coal industry. 
All of this, in the opinion of the expert, "generates a powerful 
inflationary charge for the coming months." The expert believes 
that the growth of prices may be spurred on the most by the 
indexation of fixed assets carried out effective 1 January. The 
book value of funds acquired before 1 July 1992 is being 
increased by factors of 26 to 44, those purchased in the fourth 
quarter of 1993 by a factor of 1.4, and so on. As a result of 
this, amortization allowances and, correspondingly, the producer 
cost of all products will increase sharply. Besides, Russian 
Federation Minister of Agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha is 
demanding state investment exceeding the sum of R27 trillion for 
the impoverished agro-industrial complex, intimidating the 
government with the failure of spring field work (to be sure, 
for now he has been promised R9 trillion for 1994, which is a 
sizable amount, too). 
  A major increase in prices for services took effect on 1 
January; transportation tariffs were raised. To the expert's 
mind, it is absolutely obvious that all of these actions will 
cause, in response, a wave of social demands to increase wages, 
and will create yet another inflationary detonator. 
  In conjunction with this, the expert suggested that at a 
minimum, the growth of prices by a factor of seven lies in store 
for Russia in 1994 (the growth of prices by a factor of 4.7, 
which is lower than in 1993 by a factor of two, is projected 
officially). The expert doubted the reliability of official data 
indicating a decline in the rate of price inflation in December 
to 13 percent; he said that inflation had not dropped below 20 
percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kokorin, economist: "Viewpoint. A </F>
Pseudodemocracy and a Pseudomarket"] 
  [Text] Moscow--Entering the market in our right mind, 
we have the right to lay claim to at least one of the stages of 
the capitalist cycle. And taking into account society's hopes 
that are related to it, we would like at least to end up in the 
stage of invigoration. Alas! Even depression is inaccessible to 
us. The bitter crisis determines the democratic reality. Reform 
ideologists have been forced to look for people to blame. Again 
the directors are frequently the ones they choose. 
  Not so long ago the Western economy would periodically 
experience crises, which included mass bankruptcies of 
enterprises. But nobody made any attempt to look for the causes 
of this in the incompetence of the entrepreneurs. The capable 
ones were being destroyed as well. Just as good, productive 
equipment was being destroyed and skilled workers were ending up 
out on the street. A crisis is a crisis. Although no two are 
alike. 
  Ye. Gaydar and his team are placing most of the blame for 
the 
Russian crisis on the planned nature of our previous system. But 
why does the system approach betray them when it comes to the 
crisis that is occurring before our very eyes? Why not assume 
that the cause lies in the imperfection of the economic model of 
the transition period? Because, of course, then the very 
strategy of reform would come under attack, and the authors of 
this strategy along with it. And in order to deflect suspicion 
from their own incompetence, they point to the incompetence of 
the directors. 
  Any new economic system must retain all that was positive in 
the old system. That is the law. It is a guarantee that only in 
the worst case would it be possible to have an insignificant and 
short-lived slump followed by rapid growth. The peculiarity of 
our radical reformers consists in that they see nothing positive 
in the old system of management. At the same time they are 
dividing up the wealth gained under the old system. And they are 
dividing it up with great enthusiasm, wanting to take as much as 
possible as quickly as possible. They even reach the point of 
quarreling. 
  But where did this wealth come from? Why is it that 70 years 
after the institution of private property was eliminated it has 
turned out that we have something to divide up and appropriate? 
How did it happen that, even without private property, public 
wealth multiplied, and by extremely large amounts? Why is it 
that over 40 years, from 1921 through 1961, Russia, backward and 
destroyed by war, became an industrial and even a space power? 
  The answer is obvious. The most advanced economic 
mechanism--planning--lay concealed under the totalitarian cover. 
This is what our radical democrats do not want to, and cannot, 
understand. It was not the planned economy but the totalitarian 
regime that led the country into the swamp of stagnation. The 
totalitarian regime undermined the economy and the planning 
system saved it. If in addition to the political regime our 
economic mechanism had been no good, the department of Mr. A. 
Chubays could not have started to work because there would have 
been no property. 
  The planning system saved the economy as long as the 
advantages of integration covered the costs of bureaucratism. To 
be sure, bureaucratism is a property of any large organization. 
But most frequently it is generally quite tolerable. It is 
possible to fight it successfully. Which is being done in the 
West. But bureaucratism is terrible and invincible when it is 
conditioned by a strict political system that precludes any kind 
of legal basis for fighting against state arbitrariness. 
  The planning mechanism in its final form, as the only 
instrument for management of the economy, of course, is 
inseparable from its totalitarian covering. But not because the 
totalitarianism grows out of the planning, or because the GULAG 
follows from the Gosplan [State Planning Committee], and only a 
market and private property can guarantee democracy. The 
opposite is logically correct. A market system and private 
property inevitably appear under the conditions of democracy in 
the given stage of development. Economic reform as a continuous 
process of improvement of the economic system should consist not 
in completely refraining from planning but only in augmenting 
the planning principle with the market principle. The 
planning-bureaucratic mechanism is the thesis, and the market is 
the antithesis. But where is the synthesis, Mr. radical 
democrats? The synthesis consists in a combination of planning 
and the market, in democratization of planning and gradual 
introduction of the market mechanism, which in general is what 
was discussed at the beginning of perestroyka. 
  Any coordination of actions of producers, that is, direct 
ties, is no longer a market principle but the principle of 
planning. Historically the edifice of planning is constructed on 
the basis of direct ties. If direct ties encompassed all aspects 
of the activity of all producers without exception we would have 
a uniform economic plan, and not a bureaucratic-centralized one 
but the democratic version. Of course, reformers do not deny the 
significance of direct ties. But when under the banner of 
monopolization large production associations are destroyed, the 
system of direct ties, which is impossible without associations, 
is destroyed as well. 
  A market regulated by the state is not the synthesis; it is 
essentially the antithesis in which the concept of the "planning 
principle" is lacking, and the market will always be the basis 
of the economic mechanism. The planning principle means the 
state and corporations, that which makes up the basis of the 
economic mechanism of Western countries, where the market is 
only an auxiliary, secondary instrument. But both state and 
corporate management are being undermined during the course of 
reform. This is ultimately what causes the decline of 
production. This is also where the threat of mass bankruptcies 
comes from. Bankruptcy of the enterprises means bankruptcy of 
the economic strategy of the radical reformers who lived here 
and looked to the West and therefore understood neither what was 
happening here nor what was happening there. 
  The circumstance that the plan and not the market makes up 
the basis of the economic mechanism of developed countries that 
are traditionally called market-based and capitalist countries 
is no secret to a number of economists of the West. The eminent 
American economist, J.K. Galbraith, for example, wrote about 
this 30 years ago. But we hold in esteem economists of the old, 
classical school like J. Sachs, whose ideas are too conservative 
to be applied in our homeland. This category of economists, like 
our radical reformers, does not want to recognize the 
fundamental changes in the sphere of management of the economy. 
  This is also partially where the idea of Russia's special 
path comes from. In Russia the planned economy was created 
through revolution--while the West is proceeding toward it 
gradually, carefully reforming its economic mechanism. But there 
is just one path: from the market to the plan, from private to 
public property. What, for example, is the property of 
corporations where hundreds of thousands of shareholders all 
have insignificant shares of the total capital? This is not 
private or even private group property. It is private-group 
property that is gradually becoming public. 
  It is not a matter of Russia's special path but merely the 
peculiarities of the movement along one and the same path. 
Discussions about Russia's special path are the best gift to our 
radical reformers. Try and show us now that we should not 
destroy but transform, that it is possible to reform the economy 
without curtailing production and without destroying productive 
forces. 
  The reformers have not succeeded in retaining the positive 
that existed in the old system. Moreover negative processes were 
further developed. The arbitrary behavior of state bureaucrats 
has exceeded all conceivable and inconceivable limits. As a 
result, a mafia-bureaucratic market has also been created. Such 
a market cannot exist under the conditions of democracy. It is 
either-or...

Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and 
Support of New Economic Structures: "Support for 
Entrepreneurship: Helping Those Who Help Themselves"] 
  [Text] For the Russian economy, which is traveling 
the difficult path of reform, the task of development and 
support of entrepreneurship, mainly small-scale forms of it in 
the production sphere, is one of the state's main tasks. Another 
year has passed--it is time to sum up the results. What have we 
managed to accomplish here? The editorial staff asked 
specialists of the GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy 
and Support of New Economic Structures] of Russia to answer this 
question. 
  Readers of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN know, of course, that, in 
keeping with the law "On Competition and Restriction of 
Monopolistic Activity in Commodity Markets," the Fund for 
Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition was 
finally created under the GKAP of Russia. With the irony of 
fate, the decree of the Council of Ministers-Government of the 
Russian Federation on its formation came out on 1 April 1993. 
Now the fund's activity is in the stage of establishment. Among 
the problems being solved, it is necessary to single out the 
approval by its supervisory council of the "Temporary Statute on 
the Procedure for Disbursement of the Monies of the Fund." It 
has been established that of the projects and programs already 
submitted to the Fund (for a total of 400 billion rubles [R]) 
the ones to be submitted for financing in 1993 will be those 
that meet the following conditions: the fund's credit rate is 
from 100 to 200 percent; no more than 50 percent of the overall 
cost of the project is to be financed through the fund; credit 
is to be repaid within a period of up to 1.5 years; credit funds 
may not be used to repay debts of enterprises. 
  The rest of the projects are to be included in the budget 
proposal for 1994. 
  It should be stated that more than 50 regional funds for 
support of entrepreneurship have been created on the territory 
of the Russian Federation. Territorial administrations of the 
GKAP of Russia are included on supervisory councils of the 
majority of these funds and are the initiators of their 
creation. The money in the funds ranges from R4 million (in the 
Penza fund for support of entrepreneurship) to R1 billion (the 
Nizhniy Novgorod fund for support of entrepreneurship and 
development of competition). Regional funds in local commodity 
markets have already rendered significant assistance to small 
business enterprises, including in the creation of facilities of 
the infrastructure for the development of entrepreneurship. 
  Thus, Yaroslav Oblast created a Social-Entrepreneurial 
Center 
with the participation of the territorial administration of the 
GKAP of Russia. Its purpose is to render a wide range of 
services for the development of the region's small business. And 
one of the center's features is the fact that it operates in 
direct contact with the Committee on Employment and is called 
upon to partially solve problems of social rehabilitation of the 
unemployed in the oblast (including rendering assistance in the 
organization of their own business). Within the framework of the 
center, it is intended to create a network of store-incubators, 
in which it will be possible to carry out several tasks at the 
same time: on-the-job training of students, training of 
entrepreneurs in commercial activity, and selling of products of 
local small enterprises. 
  Another of the innovations of this center is the creation of 
an incubator--a farmer-run farm based on the rural lyceum for 
orphan children in Gavrilov-Yamskiy Rayon. 
  It is also intended to open a branch of the center based on 
enterprises undergoing conversion in Rybinsk. A priority here is 
the creation of additional jobs in the sphere of production of 
consumer goods and services, introducing new technologies in the 
production sites released as a result of conversion. 
  On the basis of "Youth Housing Cooperatives" in Tula Oblast, 
also with the participation of the local antimonopoly 
administration, a business incubator has been created in which 
entrepreneurs receive all the necessary information about how to 
start their own business and where they can receive help in 
filling out all the necessary founding documents and a business 
plan. 
  In Pskov Oblast a training-entrepreneurial center with a 
business incubator and a technological park has been created on 
the basis of the Pskov training center. In 1993 about 2,000 
specialists in more than 50 occupations were trained here, 
including about 150 entrepreneur-managers of small enterprises 
and bookkeepers. Enlisting Dutch specialists, they trained a 
group of female entrepreneurs. This center is now selecting two 
groups of students (on a competitive basis) for subsequent 
employment in entrepreneurial structures. Classes will be 
conducted by teachers from Holland and Sweden. It is assumed 
that the Pskov business incubator will render assistance to 
entrepreneurs in construction, personnel selection, information 
on consumers of products produced by the small-business 
enterprises, and other questions. 
  The Far Eastern International Center for Policy in the Area 
of Small Business was created with the participation of Japanese 
business circles. A similar center is to be created in the 
northwestern region. Negotiations are already being conducted 
with representatives of state and financial structures of 
Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and administrations of the 
northwestern oblasts for the creation of an international 
business park. 
  Interesting work in this area is being done in Moscow on the 
basis of MGU [Moscow State University]. The construction of an 
innovative incubator is now being completed. The MGU Science 
Park is oriented toward support of small science-intensive 
enterprises and firms working in the area of ecology, 
biotechnology, laser and optical technologies, and information 
technologies. As of today, the selective competition has been 
completed, as a result of which 30 scientific and technical 
projects and science-intensive firms have become active members 
of the MGU science park. 
  It is planned to create a large support infrastructure in 
it, 
particularly a telecommunications center based on two satellite 
communications stations that will interact with international 
communications systems. 
  A "Tekhnopark" has been created, with the main goal of 
providing for effective development of the large Siberian region 
in Tomsk Oblast. It is a regional interdepartmental center for 
new technologies, commerce, and international relations. 
  These are only a few of the examples of organization of 
support and development of small entrepreneurship in the regions 
with the participation of the Antimonopoly Committee and its 
local administrations. Unfortunately, the significance of this 
work is not yet being matched by the necessary volumes of 
financing. In this connection, one of the areas of the activity 
of the GKAP of Russia is the organization of interregional 
interaction in the sphere of support for entrepreneurship in 
large economic regions, which makes it possible to utilize 
objects of the infrastructure and limited financial means more 
effectively. 
  In our opinion, it is most effective to render priority aid 
to those regions where the local authorities are already 
pursuing an active policy for support of entrepreneurship. This 
is not only justified from the standpoint of the effectiveness 
of the utilization of federal resources, but it also motivates 
other regions to develop this work independently.

<F P=106> [Interview with S. Belyayev, head of the Federal </F>
Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Cases, by NOVOYE 
VREMYA commentator Galina Kovalskaya, under the "Special to 
NOVOYE VREMYA" rubric; place and date not given: "If You Are 
Afraid of Bankruptcy, Do Not Venture Into a Market Economy"] 
  [Text] That the planned economy is bankrupt is clear 
by now to more than just the specialists. "Giants of socialist 
industry" have the hardest time fitting into the new environment 
of market relations. How are they to survive and, on top of 
that, operate to benefit our society and the people? How to 
avoid bankruptcy? These are issues not only for "giants," but 
also for every labor collective. The state tries to regulate 
these processes. 
  Sergey Belyayev, general director of an administration, has 
answered questions put by NOVOYE VREMYA commentator Galina 
Kovalskaya. 
  Sergey Belyayev is well known in St. Petersburg as a deputy 
of the Leningrad Soviet, chairman of the Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon 
Soviet, and subsequently deputy mayor of the city. He was in 
charge of issues of property management and privatization. He 
has things to boast of: approximately 70 percent of all 
enterprises in the city have been privatized. 
  Soon the entire country will start talking about this man. 
After all, he heads the recently created Federal Administration 
for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Cases. The administration has 
ministerial status; the subject matter it will handle is about 
the most vital and painful that there is. 
  Why is state regulation needed for what would appear to be a 
purely market-based institution, for bankruptcy? What does the 
bankruptcy of an enterprise mean under current conditions, when 
everyone owes money to everyone else, and no one pays anything 
to anyone? Will bankruptcy bring about the complete stoppage of 
production? Will half the population be left without jobs? 
  [Kovalskaya] What has the administration been established 
for? What tasks do you intend to accomplish in the immediate 
future? 
  [Belyayev] Our main goal is to prevent the complete 
liquidation of insolvent enterprises. Under legislation 
currently in effect, bankruptcy does not necessarily presuppose 
liquidation. It presupposes first of all a recovery 
(restructuring) of such production. Its complete closure is an 
extreme measure which is, of course, the most painful both for 
the owner and the labor collective. 
  By now, a large proportion of enterprises in Russia are 
either covered by bans on privatization or have not yet been 
converted to joint-stock operations. Their share comes to about 
70 percent. The notion "bankruptcy" is hardly appropriate in the 
case of the state sector. It would be strange if the owner-state 
were to appeal to some other echelons for an improvement in its 
own economic unit. What use would it have for a court of 
arbitration that would defend its rights as an owner against its 
own self, for its own credit? 
  The state has enough instruments and opportunities available 
to it to rescue its plants, banks, and mines. Privatization is 
one of the main instruments. For an enterprise, it may become a 
way to attract capital and to motivate, or if need be replace, 
the manager in the absence of all pressure from the courts. 
Besides, the state has an opportunity to support through grants 
and subsidies those of its enterprises which, as it believes, 
are necessary to keep and in the absence of which it will not 
survive. 
  There is the mechanism of state credit. Finally, there are 
state requisitions, which perhaps should be distributed 
primarily among state enterprises so that the state will act as 
a guarantor of social protection for its hired employees. 
  [Kovalskaya] It looks as if the state is doomed to 
"nourishing" state enterprises in one way or another, be it 
through easy credit, grants, or requisitions. Will the budget 
endure this? 
  [Belyayev] As far as I am concerned, I started with 
privatization. Let us draw a distinction. If an enterprise in 
its entirety fills state requisitions and receives 100 percent 
grants from the state, this is no longer an enterprise, but 
rather a state office, even if it produces goods or technologies 
in all of this. There are few of those in our country. If 
everyone is interested in these offices, and the budget has 
money to maintain them, insolvency is out of the question. 
Besides, as a rule, it is forbidden to privatize such 
enterprises. 
  However, a much greater number of enterprises are not 
covered 
by bans on privatization but are in no hurry to do this, because 
they hope for various types of support in the form of grants or 
easy credit. Well, there is not going to be easy credit any more. 
  Besides, let us grasp this: as we extend credit to 
enterprises through commercial banks, we thus provide credit to 
the banks, too. Meanwhile, virtually all of them are no longer 
state-owned, because their founders, as a rule, have become 
joint-stock companies in which the share of state property is 
declining rapidly. It turns out that the state extends easy 
credit to commercial banks without rhyme or reason. Therefore, 
the state should raise the issue of the need to privatize as 
soon as possible before an unprofitable enterprise. We are 
talking here about special privatization procedures: through an 
investment competition. Our administration is now working on a 
relevant statute. 
  Here it is for you, restructuring before court proceedings. 
The enterprise will be helped with funds, but those of private 
investors rather than the state. The interests of the labor 
collective should be taken into account in the process. That is 
to say, the new owner will have to ensure all social guarantees 
that were given by the previous owner, i.e., the state. Perhaps 
in most cases it is necessary to ensure, for a period of time, 
the preservation of jobs and the labor collective itself in 
order to prevent a social explosion, not only at enterprises, 
but in the territories. 
  Of course, it may be resolved to entirely liquidate an 
unprofitable state enterprise. However, we would like this to 
occur only with the consent of a collective if it is meant to 
happen. 
  [Kovalskaya] All of this is about state enterprises. What 
about those converted to joint-stock operations? 
  [Belyayev] In cases in which the state retains the 
controlling share or holds the golden share, it may, just as it 
has previously initiated the privatization of this enterprise, 
force through structural changes at the enterprise now through 
the procedure of declaring it bankrupt--of course, in the event 
that a continuing drop in production, indebtedness, and so on 
are evident. 
  Who will initiate bankruptcy in this case? Shareholders are 
still frequently unable to understand in a timely manner that 
they have encountered genuine insolvency. In this instance, our 
administration may display initiative by filing documents with a 
court of arbitration. Declaring an enterprise bankrupt does not 
at all mean that jobs will be liquidated. Apparently, it will 
just have to change either the manager or the output mix, or 
both, and in addition find an investor. In this situation, our 
initiative constitutes sufficient grounds for the consideration 
of the case by a court. 
  [Kovalskaya] What about enterprises that are privately owned 
in their entirety? 
  [Belyayev] In this instance, we are a powerful supervisory 
organ. That is to say, we verify to what degree the bankruptcy 
procedure conforms to legislation, how precise the decisions 
made are, and to what degree they are in line with the 
documentation filed. We may act as experts, we may become 
guarantors for documentation submitted to courts. 
  However, perhaps the foremost task of our administration is 
that we must write a number of regulatory acts for enterprises 
of all forms of ownership from which courts and creditors will 
proceed. As of now, there is no proven bankruptcy procedure; 
there are not even any criteria by which it would be possible to 
judge whether a particular enterprise needs state support by 
reason of its having statewide significance, or whether 
restructuring is necessary. 
  We would like to help private enterprises to learn to figure 
out for themselves by what criteria they can make a judgment as 
to their solvency or insolvency. We count on developing some 
sort of test questionnaire and obligating enterprise managers, 
at state and private enterprises alike, to fill it out 
periodically, so that the sore spots and dynamics of development 
will be obvious to managers themselves or shareholders. This may 
prepare them for the decision about the need to voluntarily 
declare themselves bankrupt or take other measures urgently. 
  Bankruptcy does not mean punitive actions with regard to the 
production potential of the country, but rather steps in the 
direction of its recovery. Structural changes in the economy may 
and should occur through the institution of bankruptcy. 
  [Kovalskaya] Still, while regulatory documents are lacking, 
can you say even a few words about the criteria from which you 
will proceed in developing them? 
  [Belyayev] I do not want to waste your time. Each sector 
will 
have its own criteria; virtually each sector has its 
peculiarities. Nonpayments are the common, traditional 
criterion. However, under our conditions we will have to 
consider each specific case: By and large, an enterprise is a 
debtor, while other enterprises owe still greater sums to it. 
  Or else, this example: virtually everyone owes to the energy 
industries. Perhaps this has to do with the power industry 
personnel, who build literally all outlays into the producer 
cost of power, including social security until the year 2050. 
  In addition to our administration, a few more ministries are 
working on the criteria at present, including the Ministry of 
the Economy and the Ministry of Finance. 
  [Kovalskaya] You have mentioned the possible "voluntary" 
bankruptcy and even "voluntary liquidation" of an enterprise. Do 
you indeed believe that this is realistic? 
  [Belyayev] If this is a state enterprise, the task comes 
down 
to the owner (the state) persuading the labor collective not to 
oppose such a decision. It is just that it should be explained 
to the people that it is better for them to agree to liquidation 
themselves, and in this case the state will be obliged to 
guarantee certain social welfare to the employees. Otherwise, 
the enterprise may die its own death, that is, this time around 
without any guarantees: it is just that machine tools will stop 
because there will be no raw materials, and wages will no longer 
be paid.... 
  If the collective is not at all prepared to go for 
liquidation, it might want to try rescuing the enterprise on its 
own, given that the state has acknowledged its impotence in the 
matter. In this case, the collective may lease its enterprise, 
but under a different law. I think that this particular scenario 
will be frequently followed at small enterprises. 
  It may so happen that a creditor will show initiative, and 
an 
enterprise, without taking things all the way to court, will 
agree to a voluntary bankruptcy. Our administration acts as the 
owner on behalf of the state and must find an outside manager 
for the enterprise. 
  [Kovalskaya] That is, a new director? 
  [Belyayev] That is not important. The outside manager may 
replace the director or keep the old one, but under his control. 
It is important that crucial decisions will now be up to the 
manager: for example, changes in the output mix of the 
enterprise, the sale of some assets, and so on. 
  We are planning to hold a series of "exhibition 
bankruptcies" 
in order to make the experience gained the foundation for 
regulatory documents. We are now receiving information from 
various regions concerning the state of affairs locally. We will 
soon complete the collection of information, select a few 
unpromising enterprises, and take them step by step through all 
the necessary stages, up to the court ruling. 
  [Kovalskaya] Why "exhibition"? For the edification of the 
obstinate, so to say? 
  [Belyayev] So that they will not be afraid. Our most 
important goal may be to prepare society psychologically. The 
people should understand that bankruptcy is an ordinary economic 
procedure; they should get used to the word. After all, 
bankruptcy does not mean either that the lives of enterprise 
employees are shattered or that the career of the entrepreneur 
is finished. 
  The insolvency of an enterprise does not necessarily 
indicate 
the resourcelessness of the owner or manager. It may be a 
consequence of absolutely outside, random things: for example, a 
coup d'etat has occurred in the country that was the principal 
importer of the products of the enterprise. The same 
entrepreneur may be commercially successful another time, in 
another place. Of course, the procedure presupposes that each 
hired employee who is affected by bankruptcy will enjoy social 
protection. 
  [Kovalskaya] Nonetheless, all kinds of terrifying statistics 
of the projected growth of unemployment are being given. How can 
one not be scared? 
  [Belyayev] Actually, unemployment has already become a 
reality: while not technically laying off employees, many 
enterprises operate two to three days per week, or altogether 
suggest that employees take forced leaves. This hidden 
unemployment is particularly dangerous because it is precisely 
the one to criminalize our society to the greatest degree, to 
bring about the outflow of the most flexible and capable people 
from enterprises, and to hamper structural changes. So, what 
else is there to fear? 
  The bankruptcy procedure as such will not boost the number 
of 
the unemployed. Things should not be painted in such a way that, 
supposedly, enterprises sustaining cities will be closed by 
court rulings tomorrow, and millions of people will be left with 
no food or a roof over their heads. No one intends to throw 
anyone out onto the street: nobody is suicidal, either in the 
government or among the economists. 
  Be so kind as to tell me: Can you imagine not even a few 
thousand, but a few dozen people being just thrown out onto the 
pavement in our country? It is not just our society, it is our 
entire nation that has social orientation. Besides, we do want, 
after all, to adhere to an international convention on the 
protection of the rights of the working people, under which each 
country must guarantee a certain social status to each employee 
affected by a bankruptcy. 
  However, if we are in no hurry to have bankruptcies and to 
allow insolvent enterprises to die a natural death little by 
little, the explosive growth of unemployment is unavoidable, and 
a social explosion is quite likely. 
  [Kovalskaya] This is hard to understand: If bankruptcies 
presuppose, among other things, liquidations of insolvent 
enterprises, how can the state offer guarantees against 
unemployment? Where are the people to go? 
  [Belyayev] Social guarantees may also take the form of 
instruction and new skill acquisition free of charge. We lag 
badly in the area of cadre retraining. The country is 
experiencing an acute shortage of employees in the service 
sector: it employs between 20 and 30 percent of the population 
in developed countries, but barely 5 percent here. Meanwhile, we 
are afraid of unemployment! Labor released in production shall 
be siphoned off into the service sector, into small businesses, 
instead of frightening the people with talk that they will end 
up unemployed and impoverished tomorrow. 
  When we talk about guarantees, we are not preparing sops for 
the population. Our task is to help the people in 
psychologically accepting the change in their status and 
technically mastering a new business. The experience of 
Scandinavian countries and Germany, in which the retraining 
system is highly developed, indicates that retraining may be 
established even at operating enterprises. Among other things, 
our administration must work in this area together with trade 
unions, regional employment centers, and the Ministry of Social 
Protection. 
  [Kovalskaya] You will not touch enterprises sustaining 
cities 
for now, will you? 
  [Belyayev] We definitely will. 
  [Kovalskaya] Are you not afraid? 
  [Belyayev] We are afraid of not touching them and leaving 
them to die. 
  [Kovalskaya] What are you going to do with them? 
  [Belyayev] We will decide this in each specific case. The 
output mix may be changed in some cases, but, for example, the 
unprofitable mines of Vorkuta--there is no way to change their 
output mix. Obviously, the people will have to be moved from 
there. 
  [Kovalskaya] Incidentally, about mines. This is an industry, 
one of the few, in which a genuine influential workers' movement 
exists. It is precisely this movement that comes out against 
unprofitable mines being converted to joint-stock operations. 
Leaders of the Independent Trade Union of Miners are saying: The 
industry should be brought to a certain level of profitability 
first, and privatization should be carried out next. 
  [Belyayev] Actually, it is the other way around: the path to 
profitability leads through privatization. The state will not be 
able to cope with the industry without bringing in investment. 
However, a number of mines will, of course, have to be closed. 
  [Kovalskaya] In which industries do you plan to begin 
testing 
the bankruptcy procedure? 
  [Belyayev] Our position in principle--in various industries, 
perhaps, at first in those best prepared, in those where we find 
understanding at the level of ministries and enterprise managers. 
  [Kovalskaya] Does this happen? 
  [Belyayev] Naturally. We have established a good, 
businesslike relationship with the Ministry of Transportation 
and the Ministry of Machine Building. In the immediate future, 
we will certainly establish such relationships with others. It 
is completely wrong to believe that some kind of anti-reformist 
reactionaries have ensconced themselves there. 
  Do you recall that initially the community of directors and 
ministerial functionaries received privatization poorly? By now, 
many have become its supporters, and even champions. The same 
will happen with bankruptcy as soon as it becomes obvious that 
it furthers the recovery of the industry and the entire economic 
mechanism.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Tkachenko, chief of the </F>
administration of policy for the labor market and the population 
of the Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation, by Inna 
Rozanova, under the "Employment" rubric; place and date not 
given: "Specialists To Be Called For. A View of the Problem of 
Hidden Unemployment"] 
  [Text] Assuming that the drop in production is a 
temporary phenomenon, the leaders of many enterprises are 
striving in their favorite ways to avoid massive layoffs. For 
which they are using several tried methods: a short workday or a 
short work week, leave without pay, or partially paid leave. 
This has helped some. Especially those whose work stoppages 
occurred as a result of disruptions in the delivery of raw 
materials and supplies. As soon as the previous relations were 
put in order, the collectives began to work at full speed. 
  But there also are many of those who have been frozen 
in uncertainty. There are no orders, but there are personnel. 
How long this will last is unknown. What is to be done in this 
case? We talk about this with Aleksandr Tkachenko, chief of the 
administration for policy for the labor market and the 
population of the Ministry of Labor of the Russian 
Federation. 
  "Unfortunately, there are no formulas," says Aleksandr 
Aleksandrovich. "The fact is that hidden unemployment is an 
unprecedented phenomenon. It never existed previously in the 
history of our state. For example, in the period of the 
development of capitalism in Russia, there was simply 
unemployment. But hidden unemployment arises in enterprises 
interested in retaining personnel, but this is possible only 
when the workers are highly skilled. Only a part of all of those 
employed in production in the years 1913-1914 possessed a high 
level of skill. Therefore, the need could hardly have arisen 
among employers to keep a skilled worker on a short day, while 
paying him compensation for the unused work time. But the 
unskilled were simply dismissed as unnecessary during any 
reduction in production. Although, however, some large plant 
owners granted workers who had children one free day a month. 
However, it is impossible to say that this is not full 
employment; rather, it was a social privilege." 
  [Rozanova] But how did the matter stand during stagnation? 
  [Tkachenko] That was the kingdom of fictitious employment. 
Extensive development of the economy was a rather characteristic 
feature of the period. Where one person could handle a job, five 
were on the payroll. For all practical purposes, labor 
productivity did not increase, and it was falling in individual 
branches. An enormous army of managers was engaged for a large 
part of the day in an imitation of activity. And, still, it is 
impossible to call this hidden unemployment. That appeared only 
in the course of the radical economic reform. It was the result 
of a reduction in subsidies and favorable credits to enterprises 
that became accustomed to receiving subsidies from the state. 
Now they all have to pull through by themselves, which not all 
of them are able to do. But last year the Goskomstat [State 
Committee for Statistics] for the first time conducted an 
analysis of calculated hidden unemployment as a mass phenomenon, 
and it is now doing this systematically. We do not have 
sufficient data at present to draw any kind of fundamental 
conclusions. 
  [Rozanova] And nevertheless, what kind of picture has been 
evolving to date? 
  [Tkachenko] Although a catastrophic drop in employment has 
not occurred, the process of accumulating hidden unemployment is 
continuing. It constitutes approximately 8-17 percent of the 
number of the employed in the national economy, and it is 
present in both state and in privatized enterprises, in many 
ways removing the acuteness and social danger of mass 
unemployment. But the imbalance between manpower supply and 
demand has not only failed to abate, but has gotten stronger. 
  In August of last year, according to the findings of the 
first Goskomstat investigation, there were about 2 million 
workers who were partially unemployed (9 percent of the total 
number). Eight hundred thousand persons were working under 
conditions of a short work week; moreover, the week was cut on 
the average by eight hours. More than 1 million persons were on 
leave at administrative initiative. The length of forced leaves 
in August, for example, reached an average of 12 days and, in 
addition, 45 percent of such people on leave did not receive 
even a partial wage. 
  In the first half of this year, almost 3.8 million persons 
in 
enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, 
transport and communications, everyday services, and science and 
scientific services were working in a routine of part-time 
employment on the initiative of administration (12 percent of 
the total number of workers of these branches), of which 933,000 
were switched to a short workday or a short work week. More than 
2.8 million workers were on additional leaves without the 
provision or with partial provision of wages. The total period 
of administrative leaves was 51.3 million man-days, or 18 days 
per worker, on the average. 
  [Rozanova] What branches of the national economy were hit to 
the greatest extent by this ailment? 
  [Tkachenko] Light and food industry enterprises, because of 
a 
lack of supplies of material resources, and enterprises of 
nonferrous metallurgy and the chemical and petrochemical 
industry, because of difficulties with sales. I am not even 
talking about the military-industrial complex; there it is the 
most difficult of all. 
  [Rozanova] But in what regions is the situation the worst? 
  [Tkachenko] Hidden unemployment has particularly hit the 
republics of the North Caucasus and the regions of Central 
Russia. According to data of the CIS statistical committee, 
30-32 percent of those employed in industry in Chuvashia and 
Mordvinia were partially unemployed. A high level of hidden 
unemployment was also noted in other territories of the Russian 
Federation: in Pskov, Vladimir, and Novosibirsk Oblasts, the 
republics of Mari El and Kabardino-Balkaria (21-24 percent); and 
in Tver, Kursk, Kirov, Bryansk, Kaluga, and Ryazan Oblasts 
(17-19 percent of the workers). In the southern regions of 
Russia, agricultural hidden unemployment--the so-called agrarian 
overpopulation--becomes especially noticeable. 
  More and more primary family providers are falling into the 
ranks of the unemployed and those who have been compelled to 
take part-time employment (this is men in the defense 
industries, and it is women in areas where female employment is 
prevalent). The hardest hit were oblasts with a single industry 
development--Ivanovo, Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk. 
  [Rozanova] But, after all, by keeping workers in the work 
force, enterprises are getting deeper and deeper into debt.... 
  [Tkachenko] Unquestionably. This affects the textile 
industry 
particularly. The provision of textile cotton fiber in Ivanovo 
Oblast this year amounts to about 70 percent of the requirement 
determined by the production capacities of the enterprises. Of 
course, it will not be possible to restore the previous volumes 
of fabric output. Thus, it is inevitable in the textile industry 
that there will be a release of manpower that will be equivalent 
to the level of the lack of supplies of raw material resources, 
and, according to forecasts, it will amount to not less than 
20,000-30,000 persons (according to enterprises of the 
joint-stock company IVTEKS). 
  It will be necessary on a state level to develop a special 
program for this region to reorient textile enterprises to the 
output of sewn and knitted articles and other products. At the 
same time, there will be a need to support state organs (in the 
plan of interbranch cooperation), social guarantees in the 
retraining of workers, and currency investments. According to 
the calculations of specialists of Ivanovo Oblast, expenditures 
for the implementation of these measures will total 200 million 
rubles [R]. It is possible to fulfill the entire program in two 
to two and a half years, on condition that resources are 
allocated. A similar situation is developing in the cotton 
enterprises of Vladimir Oblast. 
  [Rozanova] The number of unprofitable plants and factories 
is 
increasing, production is coming to a stop, and bankrupt 
enterprises have started to appear. Will this also make the 
ailment worse? 
  [Tkachenko] Of course, about half the losses of work time 
now 
are due to difficulties in the sale of products because of the 
insolvency of consumers, and 39 percent of the losses are 
associated with the failure to provide enterprises with raw 
materials, supplies, replenishment articles, and fuel. 
Employment cuts are expected in the chemical and petrochemical 
industry, in machinebuilding and metal processing, and 
especially in instrument building, lumber, woodworking, and the 
pulp and paper industry. An increase in the number of employed 
is expected in the coal and the oil and gas industry, and 
ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. But the number of vacancies 
will be less than the number of dismissals. 
  [Rozanova] This means that a social catastrophe is not far 
off: At any moment, millions of people could end up thrown 
outside the gates of their enterprises. Are plant directors 
really standing by and not doing anything in such a situation? 
  [Tkachenko] There are enterprises that are succeeding, as 
they say, in pulling out of the spin. There already are quite a 
few. I will name just some: The Lyuberetskiy carpet combine, the 
capital shoe factory Paris Commune, the Kosinskaya knitwear 
factory (now the Kosino joint-stock company), the Moscow 
Trekhgornaya factory, the Norilsk ore mining and processing 
combine, several aviation machinebuilding enterprises, and also 
combines for diamond processing. They were able to find and 
interest foreign investors, who supplied their own equipment. 
Part of the finished product goes to cover subsidies, and the 
rest is for the domestic market, and it has a demand because it 
is competitive. Part-time employment is reduced practically to 
zero. 
  There are successes in converted enterprises; moreover, in 
rather unexpected directions; for example, the Kirov plant in 
St. Petersburg started to produce knitted wear instead of tanks, 
and the business turned out to be quite profitable. 
  [Rozanova] How in your view does policy influence the 
problem 
we are discussing? 
  [Tkachenko] If we are talking about the policy on the labor 
market, our ministry holds to the line that the process of 
changing hidden unemployment to open unemployment should not be 
speeded up. At least for the reason that we are not prepared to 
maintain a huge army of the unemployed: after all, the norms of 
deductions for the employment fund, according to our 
calculations, make it possible to support no more than 2.5 
million unemployed. 
  In connection with the drop in production, the Goskomstat 
predicts that by the end of the year hidden reserves of manpower 
will be transformed into open unemployment. It is possible that 
the situation will be influenced to a great degree by the "Law 
on the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," which at the 
present moment is practically not functioning. It is possible 
that the decision of the Central Bank of Russia on prohibiting 
the sale of goods for foreign currency on hand after January 
will change the situation for the better. This will certainly 
reduce the importation of foreign goods and will lead to an 
increase in prices for them, but, on the other hand, a powerful 
incentive will appear for the development of a market for 
domestic goods, and, of course, domestic production also.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA economics </F>
columnist: "A Hole in the Budget Is Not a Hole in a Bagel; An 
Attempt Is Being Made To Patch It Up With Workers' Wages"] 
  [Text] The consumer price index for yet another month has 
been published. It reminded many of us, even those who rarely go 
to stores, that our income was once again cut almost in half 
just in the fourth quarter alone. 
  The supporters of radical reforms, citing statistical data, 
claim that one of the primary positive results of the shock 
therapy in 1993 was the lowering of inflation rates in 
comparison with 1992. Almost in half! But this is a deceptive 
figure. 
  Let us look into it: Due to what did inflation "get lower?" 
And did it become easier for the people to live because of this? 
  First, the general excess of the inflation in 1992 over 1993 
is linked to the January shock increase in prices by a factor of 
3.5. If it is "removed," then the average monthly inflation 
index of last year immediately becomes higher. But if two sharp 
price jumps (spring and autumn) in energy sources, of which 
there were none further on, are also excluded, then the claims 
of the reformers about lowering inflation are generally not 
corroborated by anything. 
  In addition, the startling stability of the inflation 
coefficient, which did not exist the year before last, invites 
attention: for 10 of the 12 months, it held steady in the range 
of 120-126 percent, and in only the last two months did it get 
somewhat lower. 
  This aspect is especially interesting. The trend toward a 
lowering of inflation, which appeared in September and obviously 
showed up in November-December, very accurately coincided with a 
complex of draconian measures on the regulation of financial 
mutual relations. First of all, this is expressed in the sharp 
increase in indebtedness of enterprises to one another and, as a 
consequence, in the nonpayment of wages. 
  It is difficult to estimate the true scale of indebtedness 
to 
workers of industrial enterprises. Perhaps it is even 
impossible. According to my estimates, it reaches a half 
trillion just in the industrial sphere. 
  Add the debts to "those who are paid out of the budget"--to 
workers in health services, education, science, culture, and 
state institutions. The indebtedness to students of some higher 
educational institutions is also not fully paid off. 
  There simply is no mention concerning the introduction of a 
"new" December minimum wage in the sum of 16,000 rubles [R]. It 
is clear to everyone that the question in this case concerns an 
actual half-yearly freeze on wages of workers of the budget 
branches. 
  This kind of an "anti-inflationary lever" makes it possible 
for the Ministry of Finance to uncontrolledly manipulate unpaid 
wages. 
  They are intimidating us intentionally or through 
incompetence, claiming that, apparently, the indexation of wages 
is the main factor in inflation. The explanations are crude. 
After all, it turns out: supposedly, the less indexation there 
is, the lower inflation will be, and the lower the inflation is, 
the more stable will be the budget-financing system and 
production in the economy. And there, you see, it will become 
easier for the hard worker as well. If, of course, he lasts that 
long and does not die. 
  It is necessary here to look back, to recall certain facts 
and figures, which we have already "gone through." As far back 
as a year and a half ago, the Ministry of Finance conducted at 
least two experiments with our wages. At the beginning, the 
half-yearly delay in the payment of money for wages for 
practically all enterprises and organizations of the state 
sector paralyzed the work of entire branches of the national 
economy. Many millions of workers were left without the means 
for existence, and they were forced to use up their accumulated 
savings, sell property, and even eat up the stores of "Ryzhkov" 
macaroni of blessed memory. But when this financial action was 
of necessity cut short, the government switched to another 
experiment--the actual freezing of yet another minimum wage and 
social compensation payments to the poor. 
  The second experiment also lasted about a half year. As a 
result of such "fruitful" activity of the financiers, at least 
the state budget held for all of 1992. But on the other hand, 
the people's standard of living rolled back in this period to 
some 30-40 years ago. 
  But how did inflation "behave," which, according to the 
logic 
of the reformers and stabilizers, was supposed to decrease? 
  Inflation in 1992 grew by a factor of 30 even according to 
the official statistics, and wages--by a factor of 10. Moreover, 
every month the highest rates of inflation occurred precisely in 
the periods of the declared stabilization--the fourth quarter of 
1992 and the first in 1993. Nevertheless, everyone remembers the 
triumphant speeches of all of our leaders in congresses and 
showcase meetings. 
  A similar experiment in the regulation of wages is also 
picking up speed this year, but now on a new basis--under 
conditions of a deepening crisis of the entire financial system 
that is associated first and foremost with the insolvency and 
mutual indebtedness of enterprises. We felt its appearance, 
because in the third quarter of last year there was no revision 
in the periods stipulated by law of the scale of rates of the 
Unified Wage Scale. It was revised only in September, and R8,000 
was established for the first category. 
  In addition, even the wage rates, which were changed in 
accordance with the Law on Indexation of the Minimum Wage, were 
not backed in the second quarter by corresponding budgetary 
financing. This led to many months of delays in wages. Millions 
of people went on leave without pay. 
  It will be recalled that the cost of manpower in the first 
place should at least guarantee its simple reproduction and not 
drop lower than the subsistence minimum. But in the present 
economy, the cost of manpower constitutes less than one-fourth 
of the subsistence minimum. 
  It is necessary to learn not only from someone else's 
mistakes, but also from one's own. It is necessary to pay off 
debts. Honestly and on time. I would like to offer one more 
piece of advice: we should not patch up the hole in the budget 
with workers' wages. This usually ends up badly.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Novikov: "Quite Official; It Is Easy To </F>
Become a Citizen in Our Country"] 
  [Text] In connection with making changes to the law of the 
Russian Federation "On RSFSR Citizenship," the president of 
Russia signed an edict that concretely defines the procedure for 
the examination of questions of citizenship in the Russian 
Federation. 
  This document does not affect the interests of Russians who 
are residing permanently on the territory of the Russian 
Federation and who have the passport of a citizen of the USSR 
that indicates Russian Federation citizenship. No kinds of 
additional documents will have to be drawn up for them. It 
concerns only those who desire to become Russians or to acquire 
the citizenship of another state. 
  Those who have Russian relatives will have to submit an 
application to the organs of Internal Affairs for acquiring 
citizenship, a copy of their birth certificate, and also 
confirmation of the relationship with the Russian citizens. To 
become Russians, foreigners and persons without citizenship must 
submit an appropriate petition addressed to the president of 
Russia. Parents who are citizens of different states, in 
selecting the citizenship of their child submit to the organs of 
Internal Affairs a copy of the birth certificate and written 
agreement on one or another citizenship of the child. 
  Those who desire to drop their Russian citizenship can 
submit 
an appropriate petition addressed to the president and, in 
addition, a declaration that there are no property claims 
against them on the part of physical and juridical persons of 
Russia. Draft-age youths must also have a certificate from the 
military commissariat, which corroborates that a notice on 
callup into the Army was not sent to them. 
  Verification of documents concerning a change of citizenship 
will be conducted by organs of Internal Affairs, and also by the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service of the Russian Federation. 
They will arrive at a reasoned conclusion and report their 
decision to the persons concerned.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report based on data of the Russian Federation </F>
State Committee on Statistics: "Results of Russian Industry 
Operations for 11 Months"] 
  [Text] In January-November 1993 the volume of industrial 
production as compared to the analogous period of last year 
declined by 16 percent, including by 15 percent in November. 
  The output of sectors producing for the consumer market 
declined by 12 percent, and of those manufacturing producer 
goods--by 18 percent, which to a certain extent is the result of 
diminished investment demand. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical, timber, woodworking, pulp 
and paper, and light industry, output fell by 18-25 percent as 
compared to 11 months of last year; in the fuel and raw material 
sectors (power generation, gas, coal, ore mining for ferrous 
metallurgy), output fell by 6-9 percent. 
  During the last few months, in the fuel and energy complex, 
one sees a characteristic increase in output of major energy 
resources. 
  Over 11 months the output of gas amounted to 560 billion 
cubic meters; coal--277 million tonnes; and oil--314 million 
tonnes (including gas condensate), which is less than over the 
analogous period of last year by 4 percent, 10 percent, and 13 
percent, respectively. The volume of power generation declined 
overall by 5 percent, and at thermal electric power stations by 
8 percent. 
  In ferrous metallurgy as compared to 11 months of last year 
output of finished rolled metal dropped off by 7 percent, and of 
steel pipe by one-quarter. At the same time, certain structural 
changes are taking place in the sector. While total steel 
smelting fell off by 12 percent, output of converter steel 
declined by 3 percent. The share of this advanced method in the 
total volume of production currently is 38 percent as compared 
to 34 percent in 1992. 
  In machine building, over January-November 1993 as compared 
to the same period of last year, production of construction 
cranes declined by almost one-half; freight railcars and large 
electric machinery--by one-third; main line diesel 
locomotives--by more than one-quarter; and metal-cutting machine 
tools and alternate current electric motors--by almost 20 
percent. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry over 
January-November of 1993 the output of chemical fiber and thread 
amounted to 74 percent of that for last year, and automotive 
tires--89 percent; the output of mineral fertilizer has not 
exceeded 80 percent of the level of the corresponding period of 
last year. At the same time, positive structural changes are 
manifesting themselves in their production: The share of mineral 
fertilizer in granulated form has increased from 58 percent to 
63 percent. 
  In 1993 there were structural changes in the production of 
chemical fiber and thread. The share of artificial thread and 
fiber requiring less expenditure of material resources increased 
(from 43 percent in January-November 1992 to the current 49 
percent), as did the production of those closest in quality to 
natural thread and fiber--rayon textile thread (from 6.5 percent 
to 8.1 percent) and rayon fiber (from 28 percent to 34 percent). 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry over 
the elapsed 11 months, output of cardboard and sawn lumber 
declined by one-quarter; of woodchip board--by 12 percent, and 
plywood--by 18 percent. There was also a decline in the 
production of window and door units, mine props, prefabricated 
homes and sets of home-building components made of wood, and 
wood containers. 
  Despite the seasonal increase in the production of 
commercial 
wood that began in November, its monthly output ended 27 percent 
below that of last year, and over January-November overall--28 
percent. 
  At the same time, the decline in paper production slowed 
down 
somewhat--from 25 percent in the first half of the year to 13 
percent in July-November. The output of writing and notebook 
paper, as well as some varieties of printing paper produced 
predominantly for the domestic market, declined by 25-43 percent. 
  In light industry the output of footwear declined by almost 
one-third as compared to January-November of last year; of 
fabrics, knitwear, and some varieties of sewn items (coats and 
short coats, jackets, and shirts)--by 25-29 percent; and of 
hosiery--by 13 percent. Production of items for children 
declined to a greater extent--by 31-49 percent. 
  In the cultural, personal, and household goods market the 
situation is more favorable. To a certain extent due to new 
capacities being brought on line and conversion of defense 
enterprises, production of a number of complex appliances and 
machines increased over January-November 1993 as compared to the 
analogous period of last year; this includes freezers, two- and 
three-chamber refrigerators, kitchen food mixers, color 
television sets, goods for use on private farms and auxiliary 
and garden plots--modular engines, motorized cultivators, and 
mini-tractors. At the same time, the low degree of 
attractiveness of domestically produced goods as compared to 
imported ones and the population's limited buying power resulted 
in a reduction of output in the communication industry--such as 
video cassette recorders, radio receivers, and tape recorders 
(18-38 percent), and of photo cameras by instrument-making 
industry enterprises (by 46 percent). 
  In the food processing industry output of basic foodstuffs 
is 
characterized by the following data: 


Product          Production                          November (average 
                                                     daily output) as %

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and </F>
Industry President S. Smirnov, by EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN 
correspondent B. Rachkov: "Russia Will Be Reborn Through 
Entrepreneurship"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the new year, Stanislav 
Alekseyevich Smirnov, president of the Russian Federation 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry [TPP], talked with our 
EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN correspondent. The conversation began with the 
most important event to occur in the life of the Russian Chamber 
this past year. 
  [Smirnov] This important event was, of course, the 
establishment of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as 
a public organization representing entrpreneurship in our 
country. Public, not state, as it essentially had been before. 
An organization expressing and defending the interests of 
entrepreneurs of all forms of property, not exclusively state 
property, as in the past. 
  At the same time we are not repudiating everything positive 
accomplished by the former union chamber and its structural 
subdivisions. I want to emphasize, however, that under 
conditions of transition to the market, even the best of the 
former chamber has nearly always been turned into its opposite 
and has yielded to bureaucratic turnpikes on the new roads to 
initiative and independence. On the other hand, any independent 
energy and initiative from new market structures cowered before 
the shadow cast by the old official grandeur of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry. The chamber's former administrative skill 
had to be placed firmly in the service of the enterprise being 
born among us. Enterprise in all its forms, from large, medium, 
and small enterprises, from juridical and physical persons, from 
the leaders of state industrial giants to private entrepreneur 
just starting out. 
  Bear in mind that the first stage in the establishment of 
the 
chamber came about in a legislative vacuum. Many factors 
hindered the actual legislation of the Russian chamber's new 
functions, which are the same as those generally accepted 
throughout the civilized world. The tension of the political 
struggle around economic transformations in Russia also took its 
toll on the reforming of public entrepreneurial organizations, 
the highest link of which are the chambers of commerce and 
industry. Actually, sticks have been thrust into the wheels of 
reform frequently just out of ordinary incompetence and 
sloppiness. Otherwise, how can we explain the impartial facts of 
looting and pilfering--if not by local authorities then by local 
"bosses"--of the bulk of what was created by the union chamber. 
  By March 1993, however, the presidential edict "On the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation" had 
put a great deal in place. It not only put a stop to anarchy in 
the interpretation of the federal chamber's role under market 
conditions, it also defined the chamber's new functions as an 
important public entrepreneurial organization. The edict 
stimulated the passage of an even more necessary document, the 
corresponding law, which was also drafted under rather 
contradictory circumstances. Without going into depth, I will 
cite one telling detail: the bill's opponent, representing 
primarily the interests of yesterday's command system, unable to 
block passage of the law in parliament, actually drafted a 
presidential veto. It didn't work out, though. The law "On the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation" laid 
down precise legal bases for all lines of activity of the main 
public union for our country's entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, a 
new law was drafted "On International Commercial Arbitration," 
which, along with the first law, lent Russia's system of 
chambers of commerce and trade and their functions new meaning, 
like that generally accepted in world practice. 
  [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Stanislav Alekseyevich, the difficult 
path and the drama of initiating the activities of the Russian 
TPP are similar to what is going on in general in our country's 
economy. What do you think, will the chamber in its new capacity 
be able to introduce any kind of organizing principle into the 
rebirth of the Russian economy? 
  [Smirnov] Yes, we are not functioning in isolation from the 
country's economy. We are experiencing along with it and the 
people as a whole the same economic successes, losses, and 
failures. The definite advance toward a civilized market is our 
success as well. The colossal drop in production and foreign 
trade circulation for the country has had a negative effect on 
our activities as well. Most Russian Federation TPP members and 
many of its foreign partners agree that "shock therapy" has 
proved itself an inadequate means for pulling the economy out of 
its stagnation, that it did not take into consideration the 
country's social, ethnic, and cultural characteristics. Under 
these conditions, we see our chief task as introducing more 
common sense and social principles into the reforming of the 
economy. We are striving to do this on all levels--locally, in 
the various regions of Russia through the more than 60 
territorial chambers of commerce and trade, and also at the 
highest level, in the capital, using our own legislative 
initiative, entrusted to us by the law, and also using our 
authorization to participate in the activities of the structures 
of executive power. 
  Most importantly, we are directing our main efforts toward 
protecting and representing the interests of our country's 
entrepreneurship in the center and in the locales, in our own 
country and abroad. For the federal and territorial chambers, 
there are no higher interests than the interests of 
entrepreneurship in general and of each entrepreneur in 
particular. 
  Our work has been complicated by continuing attempts to push 
the chamber away from economic creation, to nudge it onto the 
path of political confrontations. No farther back than at the 
recent session of the Russian Federation TPP, in December 1993, 
another attempt was made to draw entrepreneurs into a harsh 
political struggle. A corresponding resolution was even 
introduced. 
  [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Yes, that was a dramatic episode toward 
the end of the congress. We journalists waited with impatience 
and alarm for your reaction to the next political maneuver 
within your representative forum for business people. After all, 
this was happening at the height of the Russia-wide election 
battles for the Duma and the Federal Assembly. 
  [Smirnov] The chamber's administration and I as its 
president 
recognize full well how important it is for Russia to have 
effective legislative organs. That is why when it came to 
supporting candidates for the new parliament we bore in mind not 
so much their party affiliation as their potential ability to 
adopt a balanced reformist position and actively facilitate the 
development of Russian entrepreneurship. Nor did the TPP stand 
on the sidelines during the pre-election struggle. We held 
meetings with leaders from several blocs and parties, as a 
result of which we were able to clarify for ourselves the 
illnesses and tasks of young Russian business. In other words, 
our chamber is scarcely an apolitical organization. 
  The only thing we are against is extremism, not only in the 
economy but also in politics. Extremism in any form is 
contraindicated for entrepreneurship. History teaches us this, 
too. 
  [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Our weekly, and you are well aware of 
this, regularly and from time to time sheds detailed light on 
the specific lines of activity of the federal and territorial 
chambers of trade and commerce. I would like to take advantage 
of this conversation with you and report to the more than 
half-million subscribers to EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN your opinion on 
several other problems. 
  [Smirnov] I think that none of us have any common problem 
more important than achieving Russia's rebirth. I am deeply 
convinced that this rebirth lies through the normal development 
of our country's entrepreneurship. For the time being, 
specifically through the development and logical shaping and 
organization of modern, competitive structures, and then through 
them prospering. 
  An understanding of this mission permeates all links of the 
Russian Federation TPP, the territorial chambers, and our member 
organizations. It is gratifying that their number is constantly 
growing. Today the chamber comprises about 20 Russia-wide branch 
associations of entrepreneurs and nearly 90 local unions and 
associations of business people. 
  If we were to talk about the most critical problems shared 
by 
all entrepreneurs, then they are obvious. The main problem is 
that the reforms carried out so far have not created auspicious 
conditions for the development of our country's 
entrepreneurship. Due to the pressure of taxation, our 
undeveloped legal base, and the miscalculations of privatization 
and stock distribution, our country's productive and 
scientific-technical potential are being undermined. 
Entrepreneurs have been forced to concentrate their activities 
in the sphere of circulation and are not risking investment in 
production with a long cycle or in the infrastructure. The 
permit-ridden, very complicated system for opening new objects 
of economic life is fettering entrepreneurial initiative and 
simultaneously expanding the ground for corruption and graft. 
Isn't the high inflation, the lack of advances in structural 
perestroika, and the looming unemployment that threatens to turn 
not 5 million but 15-20 million Russians into unemployed even 
more alarming? 
  The committees and commissions of the Russian Federation TPP 
and the scientific, industrial, financial, and other economic 
institutions that are collaborating closely with them are 
actively involved in resolving those critical problems cited 
here as well as others. I assure you, this work is not 
pointless. Our proposals and drafts are always awaiting the 
attention of the legislative and executive structures now 
forming. So that our work does not find itself out in the cold 
with legislative institutions again, we are acquiring the ways 
of civilized lobbying as we go--naturally, in the interests of 
our country's entrepreneurship. 
  [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Earlier you touched on the problem of 
employment. It's somehow unusual to associate this problem with 
the activities of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  [Smirnov] You are not the only one to think that. This is 
one 
more stereotype bequeathed to us from the times when employment 
here was given out as a per capita statistic, and so there was 
no one and no reason to worry about unemployment, especially for 
the chamber. In a developed modern market society, though, 
successful entrepreneurship and robust employment are two sides 
of the same coin. You can't have one without the other, as many 
chambers of commerce and industry in the West have clarified for 
themselves long since. Anyone in the know is aware that in 
Japan, Germany, Italy, Austria, and many other states, economic 
prosperity and civil stability are grounded specifically in a 
literate social partnership, which is significantly ensured by 
the well-regulated cooperation of the chambers of the trade 
unions, entrepreneurs, and the state. 
  This is why our chamber's representatives are taking an 
increasingly active part in the activities of the Russian 
Trilateral Commission's working group on the regulation of 
social-labor disputes. 
  [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] We have not had time to touch on several 
other lines of activity specific to the chambers. But your 
affairs are just unfolding, and the year has only begun. I look 
forward to meeting with you again. 
  [Smirnov] I am always happy to get together with the readers 
of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, who, as I have been told, together with 
subscribers total more than 3 million. One has to assume that 
these are all people of business and primarily "decisionmaking," 
as people say nowadays, in economic life. It is a worthwhile 
audience for representatives of the chambers of commerce and 
industry.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Druzhinina, DELOVOY MIR correspondent: </F>
"By Its Own Path -- the Privatization Process in Petersburg Is 
Developing"] 
  [Text] Petersburg remains the leader in Russian 
privatization. Some 350 enterprises, already registered as open 
joint-stock companies, passed through municipal and all-Russian 
check auctions last year. A real basis has therefore been 
created for a second securities market. 
  Mikhail Manevich, chairman of the Committee for Municipal 
Property Management (KUGI) of the municipal council, informed us 
that out of 854 -- the total number of enterprises subject to 
privatization -- the documents for 487 were examined and 
approved at KUGI. In the course of last year, check auctions 
were intensive (held several times a month) in the city, and 
5,328,545 vouchers were accumulated at them. This amount exceeds 
the number of inhabitants in the city. Since we know that not 
all the Petersburg citizens have parted with their vouchers yet, 
this means that there is a process of drawing in checks from 
other regions. This makes it possible to draw a conclusion as to 
how attractive Petersburg's enterprises are to potential 
shareholders. 
  An analysis of the choices of privatization variants in 1993 
reveals the following picture: over 120 enterprises preferred 
the first variant, 330 liked the second and 15 were privatized 
according to the third variant. In a percentage ratio, choice of 
the first variant of privatization (the most "capitalistic") was 
higher in Petersburg than in other regions of Russia. 
  Investment marts (a constituent link to privatization 
complexes) began only last year. There are no grounds as yet for 
talking about their mass success. Manevich thinks that the 
reason why investors do not display the desired activity at the 
marts is the lack of high-quality business plans worked out in 
detail. Nevertheless, as an example of the successful holding of 
investment marts, he mentioned the experience of the Samson 
Meat-Processing Combine Joint Stock Company and of the 5th Dairy 
Combine, in which the well-known Parmolat firm acquired a block 
of shares. Re-outfitting these production facilities with modern 
equipment had already yielded results in the form of new meat 
and dairy products. According to plans approved in KUGI, another 
10 investment marts will be held in Petersburg in the next two 
months. Specialists feel that marts like these are the optimal 
variant for changing the form of ownership and are really 
contributing to drawing funds into the production sphere. 
  Petersburg's leading position is established not only by its 
quantitative indicators, but also by the "running-in" of new 
investment schemes. The charter documents of a number of 
enterprises specify a 50-percent increase in charter capital 
after part of the investment programs are fulfilled. An investor 
acquiring 20 percent of the shares in alliance with the 
initiative group of enterprise workers, actually turns out to be 
the owner of the controlling block. 
  Almost a year's experience in carrying out "large-scale" 
privatization in Petersburg makes it possible to speak of 
certain special features in it, and of the general stabilization 
of the privatization process. One stabilizing factor is the 
presence of a legislative state and normative-regional base, 
lacking at the start of privatization. Among the special 
features is the appearance of a competitive market in 
Petersburg. Today the owner of a voucher can choose from 
enterprises producing goods of the same description and invest 
in its stock. A second feature is the appearance of really 
active investment institutions: banks, brokerages and financial 
investment companies. A third feature lies in the change in the 
psychological climate surrounding the process of privatization. 
While at the beginning of last year, notes Manevich, the 
associates of KUGI and the municipal property fund had to 
convince enterprise directors and workers of the advantages and 
need for shareholding, the picture is now just the opposite. 
Representatives of enterprises are pressing KUGI to be included 
in the privatization plan. Moreover, practical experience in 
stock-holding increasingly proves the inefficiency of the second 
variant of privatization, according to which the controlling 
block of shares should theoretically belong to the work 
collective. In reality, the shares are bought from the workers 
by outside parties, and the enterprise loses control over the 
production and also the possibility of attracting sound 
investors. 
  Privatization of privatization itself has become another 
special feature. A system is forming in Petersburg of check 
auctions being held, not by a property fund, but on the 
instructions of banks, financial-investment companies or other 
middlemen. In this way, separation of the privatization process 
from the state is observed. 
  Mikhail Manevich also noted that the method, adopted at the 
start of privatization, of evaluating the property of an 
enterprise by the residual value has proven itself and has not 
affected the sale of stocks. Nevertheless, despite the widescale 
distribution of privatization, it is still too early to talk 
about the economic efficiency of enterprises which have changed 
the form of ownership. Investment marts, which must be regarded 
as post-privatization support of enterprises, are still in store 
for many of them. 
  The formation of the municipal program of privatization-94 
is 
ending in Petersburg. Since, according to the federal program of 
privatization-94, the functions and powers of the regions are 
expanded, the Petersburg program has its own special features. 
In particular, privatization according to the first variant only 
is permitted for hotels. The allotting of a "golden share" for 
the state is specified in the privatization of publishing and 
printing enterprises and book traders. One must also include 
among the special features the permission to buy up built-in and 
added-on facilities, for which long-term lease contracts are 
concluded according to the results of competitions and auctions.

<F P=106> [Article: "Will We Have Enough To Eat?"] </F>
  [Text] In the last few years, despite the semblance 
of well-being, the situation with the food supply for the 
population has deteriorated sharply. Russia has never had enough 
food. In 1989 the need for basic agricultural products was met 
by only 58 percent. In 1993 this indicator dropped to 37 
percent. What awaits us in 1994? 
  These figures were mentioned at a board meeting of the RF 
Committee on Trade, where the food problem was discussed. 
  During 11 months, as compared with the same period of last 
year, the volumes of sales of livestock and poultry for 
slaughtering decreased in 67 out of Russia's 77 regions, of 
milk, in 61 regions, and of eggs, in 35 regions. The reduction 
in the stock of cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats, owing to its 
considerable discarding on kolkhozes and sovkhozes, is 
compensated for only partially by the increase in the number of 
animals in private homesteads. The breeding stock has also 
decreased in many regions, which undermines the foundations of 
animal husbandry over the long term. 
  During 11 months of 1993, as compared with 1992, the 
production of basic foodstuffs decreased as follows: of meat, by 
16 percent; of butter, by 4 percent; of sugar, by 5 percent; of 
vegetable oil; by 34 percent; of whole milk products, by 16 
percent. 
  In Russia in the middle of December the average price per kg 
of first-category beef was 1,949 rubles. Throughout cities the 
situation with prices looked as follows: in Kemerovo, 2,800 
rubles; in Murmansk, 2,622 rubles; in Ryazan, 1,784 rubles; in 
Belgorod, 1,440 rubles; in Ulyanovsk, 561 rubles. Milk prices 
also differ very substantially: in Arkhangelsk, 390 rubles; in 
Kemerovo, 360 rubles; in Kirov, 248 rubles; in Tula, 192 rubles; 
in Ulyanovsk, 61 rubles. There is a big "spread" in the cost of 
bread. The most expensive is in Kemerovo--311 rubles. The 
cheapest is in Ulyanovsk--47 rubles. Sugar: in Tyumen, 900 
rubles; in Kemerovo, 311 rubles; in Belgorod, 581 rubles; on the 
average throughout Russia, 708 rubles per kg. 
  A reduction in livestock products is expected this year. The 
state purchase of [refined] and raw sugar is not envisaged, 
whereas only one-third of the needs of the Russian Federation 
for sugar are met by its own production. Vegetable oil and milk 
products will not be sufficient. There will not be enough 
vegetable oil and milk products. In 1994 it is difficult to 
forecast the import of foodstuffs purchased by state and other 
organizations and enterprises in connection with the lack of 
clarity about customs duties for their import. 
  It should be stated that the per-capita delivery of basic 
food products has decreased annually and in 1993, in relation to 
the 1991 level, comprised the following: of meat products, 58 
percent; of milk products, 64 percent; of vegetable oil, 38 
percent; of sugar, 84 percent. 
  In 1993, as compared with 1992, the sale of fish declined to 
45 percent. And this, despite the fact that the fishing fleet 
came to a standstill--ships were filled with products. The 
volumes of export of fish products from the country exceed the 
consumption inside the country, although everyone knows that the 
demand of the Russian people has not been met. With regard to 
this year resources are quite sufficient. However, the 
exorbitantly high transport rates spoil everything. For example, 
the delivery of every kilogram of fish from the Far East costs 
240 rubles. The price of fish products in retail trade has long 
outstripped meat products. 
  A reduction in the production of canned goods is not 
expected. There are no problems with salt. Its remainders in 
warehouses are increasing. Vodka is the only product, the sale 
of which proceeded "with a plus" last year, making up 106 
percent of the 1992 level. Things are not going too well with 
tobacco. The domestic industry is capable of meeting only 50 to 
60 percent of the need for tobacco products. Previously, imports 
rescued us. Now the excise on tobacco greatly hampers deliveries 
from abroad. And so, if nothing changes, it will not be possible 
to meet the population's demand. 
  As was noted at the last board meeting of the RF Committee 
on 
Trade, with the shortage of food resources in Russia the 
creation of insurance food volumes is simply necessary for a 
guaranteed supply for servicemen and residents of the Far North 
and of ecologically polluted territories of large industrial 
centers, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, and for the 
fulfillment of state goal-oriented programs adopted by Russia's 
government--"Children of Chernobyl," "Children of the North," 
"Protection of the Russian Federation Population Against the 
Effect of the Chernobyl Catastrophe," and others. 
  The RF Committee on Trade advocates the preservation of 
federal food stocks for this year at last year's level. However, 
the draft decree of the Council of Ministers "On Food Deliveries 
for Federal Needs for 1994" provides for a significant reduction 
in the volumes and number of consumers of these stocks. It 
proposes that they be formed only in order to provide the 
military and categories of consumers equated with them, to 
replenish state reserves, and to create operational government 
reserves--and only of several types of foodstuffs at that. 
  In this case federal stocks are envisaged in the following 
volumes: of grain--9.6 million tonnes, or 96 percent of the 1993 
level; of meat products--633,000 tonnes, or 37 percent; of dairy 
products--3,349,000 tonnes, or 26 percent; of 
vegetables--466,000 tonnes, or 48 percent; of sugar--839,000 
tonnes, or 20 percent; of vegetable oil--166,000 tonnes, or 15 
percent; of eggs--1,445 million, or 9 percent. 
  In order to provide incentives for rural commodity 
producers, 
it is planned to make advance deliveries amounting to no less 
than 70 percent of the value of contracted products. Despite the 
fact that Russia's Ministry of Agriculture, the RF Committee on 
the Food and Processing Industry, the RF Committee on Fishing, 
and the Roskhleboprodukt Joint-Stock Company insist on the 
preservation of previous volumes of federal stocks, the Ministry 
of Economics considers it possible to allocate funds only if the 
number of federal recipients is reduced. 
  Recently, a special subdivision engaged in problems of 
commodity supply for Moscow has been established in the RF 
Committee on Trade. How to feed the city of many millions? This 
question has always been quite acute. The committee has prepared 
a draft decree of the Council of Ministers "On Measures To 
Provide the Population of the City of Moscow With Food During 
the First Half Year of 1994," which determines the volumes of 
basic food products at the 1993 level. However, the fair on the 
sale of food products held in the capital on 16-17 December made 
it possible to conclude contracts for their delivery in 1994 
from Russia's regions as follows: of meat--75,000 tonnes, or 62 
percent of the volumes, which, according to our calculations, 
are needed; of butter--7,500 tonnes, or 75 percent; of dry 
milk--2,000 tonnes, or 67 percent; of vegetable oil--0,100 
tonnes, or 0.2 percent. Only cheese (5,700 tonnes, or 190 
percent) and sugar (60,000 tonnes, or 120 percent) will be 
sufficient until July. Undoubtedly, Moscow is a special city 
both in terms of the number of its residents, its status, and 
other indicators. The RF Committee on Trade advocates that the 
country's capital also be included among federal recipients. 
Unfortunately, the Ministry of Economics has another opinion. 
  To all the above-stated I would like to add that the new 
customs duties on many key food products greatly aggravate the 
food situation. The RF Committee on Trade asked the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations not to apply customs duties to meat, 
meat products, milk, dairy products, sugar, vegetable oil, and 
baby food at least for contracts concluded before 1 January 1994. 
  Thus, all forecasts can be made only tentatively, except for 
one: under conditions of the increase in inflationary processes, 
the crisis of insolvency and financial instability of 
enterprises, and the unbalance of previous trade relations a 
saturation of the market with food at prices within the reach of 
the basic population is not foreseen.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Vladimir </F>
Belyanov: "There Is No Upsurge in Sight: Enterprise Directors 
Appraise the Situation in the National Economy"] 
  [Text] DELOVOY MIR regularly publishes the results of 
monthly surveys of Russian industrial enterprise directors, 
conducted by the independent bulletin ROSSIYSKIY EKONOMICHESKIY 
BAROMETR [THE RUSSIAN ECONOMIC BAROMETER]. The survey's regular 
respondents consist of about 150 directors of industrial 
enterprises in different regions of Russia. The specificity and 
the value of the observation sample is in that it represents the 
most typical entities. It consists of medium-sized enterprises 
(800-1,200 employees). Naturally, they produce first and 
foremost for the domestic market and know the state of it well. 
  These enterprises do not possess any monopoly privileges. 
Although a considerable number of them have gone through the 
crucible of privatization (the share of state-owned enterprises 
has declined over nine months of 1993 from 52 percent to 30 
percent), they have not experienced (so far) any perceptible 
effect of it. The respondents' answers are notably uniform. The 
spread of opinions is minimal. All of this indicates a 
sufficiently high level of competency and precision of the 
directors' observations. 
<H5>  The Protracted Decline </H5>
  What do the directors think about the situation as a whole? 
  Last time we compared the results of the first six months of 
1993 with respective forecasts of the respondents. Now, 
following the same pattern, let us look at the data of another 
six-month period--April-September 1993 (see Table 1). 


Table 1. Some Summary Indicators for April-September 1993 and the Forecast 
for March 1994 (in percents) 

                          September 1993 as % of March      Forecast: March 
                          1993                              1994 as % of 
                                                            September 1993 

                          Forecast made     Actual

1. Real volume of         99                101             98 
output, contract work, 
services 

2. Number of employees    96                97              97 
(including 
supernumeraries, 
contractors, part-time 
employees, etc.) 

3. Real volume of         35                49              46 
capital investment 

4. Average prices of      193               259             239 
the output produced 

5. Average prices of      233               304             293 
purchased products 

6. Employees' average     175               260             193 
monetary wages 


  The data in this table show again that the directors' 
forecasts are quite precise. They undoubtedly appraise correctly 
the trends in the economic situation. 
  The fact that the directors register a relative stability of 
the real volume of production, contract work, and services 
(which contradicts official data of the State Committee on 
Statistics) is somewhat puzzling. Additional analysis shows that 
this is primarily the result of the fact that the respondents 
represent medium-sized enterprises. The latter turn out more 
stable in the environment of general economic instability than 
their largest and smallest colleagues. Actually, this stability 
means only, figuratively speaking, running in place. No more 
than that. 
  This time the directors again showed themselves to be both 
pessimists and optimists. Over six months, investment at 
enterprises has fallen not by a factor of three (as they had 
anticipated) but only by half. On the other hand, the directors 
just cannot overcome their timidity in judging inflationary 
expectations. The real rise in prices considerably exceeded the 
directors' forecasts: over six months, prices for enterprises' 
output rose by a factor of 2.6 (instead of 1.9, as forecast); 
prices of purchased products--threefold (instead of 2.3, as 
forecast); and the price of labor (wages) rose over this period 
by a factor of 2.6 (instead of 1.75, as forecast). 
  On the main subject, the directors' evaluation was entirely 
correct: as they had predicted, production is falling slowly or 
is in a state of stagnation; investment is declining swiftly; 
prices of purchased products are running ahead of selling 
prices; wage increases do not keep up with the rate of 
inflation, which signals a continuing decline of real income of 
workers at industrial (in this case, average, typical) 
enterprises. 
  Such negative stability is revealed by many other indicators 
as well. 
  According to the respondents' monthly appraisals, the degree 
of utilization of enterprises' production capacities remained 
within the range of 71-74 percent of the level they consider as 
normal for the corresponding period (in the first half of the 
year the appraisal produced an indicator of 72-78 percent). The 
share of enterprises where the degree of production capacity 
utilization has increased fluctuated during the third quarter 
within the range of 6-13 percent (in the first half of the year, 
8-14 percent), while the share of enterprises where this 
indicator remained unchanged in the third quarter fluctuated 
within the 46-60 percent range (58-66 percent within the first 
half of the year). The share of barter deals in enterprises' 
turnover remained stable--9 percent. The level of inventories of 
unsold products also remained stable as compared to the "normal 
level"--86-97 percent (82-99 percent in the first half of the 
year) and the backlog of orders--79-83 percent (79-92 percent in 
the first half of the year). 
  At the same time, there are visible signs of the continually 
worsening financial situation of enterprises: In September, only 
20 percent of the respondents evaluated it as good (in January 
there were 4 percent, and in June--1 percent); 64 percent 
considered it bad (52 percent in January and 59 percent in 
June); and 34 percent appraised it as normal (44 percent in 
January and 39 percent in June). The share of enterprises where 
the financial conditions of operations have improved measured in 
the third quarter as follows: with respect to conditions of 
obtaining bank credit--0-2 percent (2-6 percent in the first 
half of the year); with respect to the ratio of selling prices 
to prices of purchased products--2-3 percent (1-7 percent in the 
first half of the year). On the other hand, 24 percent of the 
respondents expressed hope that in six months (by March 1994) 
their enterprises' financial situation would improve (but in 
January 1993, 33 percent of the respondents still had that 
hope). Respondent enterprises' debt to banks in September 1993 
was 77 percent greater than in March 1993 (in June 1993 it was 
57 greater than in December 1992, and in March 1993, 38 percent 
greater than in September 1992). 
  One may consider as a certain indicator of directors' 
expectations the answers to the question: "Is a threat of 
bankruptcy real for your enterprise within the next one to two 
years?" In February 1993, 15 percent of the respondents answered 
affirmatively; in May, 23 percent; and in August 1993, 28 
percent. 
  Looking six months ahead, the directors did not find it 
expedient to adjust their expectations. They envision March 1994 
much the same as compared to September 1993: real volume of 
output--98 percent; the number of employees--97 percent; real 
volume of capital investment--46 percent; selling prices--239 
percent; prices of purchased products--293 percent; and the 
average wage--193 percent. 
  As before, directors persist in the opinion that economic 
growth will resume only in five or six years. 
<H5>  Such Familiar Reasons </H5>
  As before, the respondents were asked to name three out of 
12 
possible choices among the primary factors holding back the 
development of production over the preceding six months. Replies 
are summarized in Table 2.

  The picture has remained practically unchanged: the 
situation 
in the sphere of turnover--the situation in financial and 
commodity markets--is leading the pack. The only perceptible 
trend worth noticing is an increasing weight of financial 
problems in 1993: the pressure of insufficient financial means, 
and especially the tax burden, has increased. 
  The influence of the enterprises' own financial factors is 
so 
great that they seem to be beginning to exert an essentially 
antimarket pressure on the economy. The evidence of this is the 
strange (from the market standpoint) situation whereby demand 
for products and prices for production factors (raw materials, 
component parts, semifinished products, labor, transportation, 
information services, and so on) have an increasingly 
diminishing effect on the producer. 
  The situation in the labor and investment goods markets 
remains one of the lesser concerns for enterprises. The impact 
of the privatization process on enterprises is completely 
negligible. It looks as if the predominantly monetarist approach 
to stimulating a market is beginning to kill the market itself. 
  Another indication of the causes for the decline are the 
answers to another question: What does the enterprise need first 
and foremost in order to adapt faster to the current situation? 
(see Table 3). In this question, too, the respondents were asked 
to choose three out of 12 possible options. The data received in 
March and June of 1993 have already been published; the replies 
received in August are being published for the first time.

fine as is 


  Of course, the replies to this question add color to the 
total picture, make it more graphic: The concentration of 
singular factors is much less prominent here. 
  There are no grounds, however, to change the general 
conclusion above. The impact of the monetary factor has 
increased, first and foremost as a result of nonpayments on the 
part of customers and difficulties in paying debts to suppliers. 
The impact of indebtedness to banks has attenuated somewhat, 
although, as noted above, the total volume of such debt has 
increased. Apparently, this is a relative decrease--the impact 
of other factors is stronger. 
  Quite abnormal is the weakening of influence of such 
strictly 
market factors as the need to search for new distribution 
markets and changing the mix of the output produced. 
  One could cheer a greater weight of the need to expand 
production capacities had it been accompanied by increased 
investment and demand for the enterprise's output. 
Unfortunately, most likely this reflects the sad fact that the 
existing production apparatus is fast becoming obsolete and the 
beginning of its decline in absolute terms. 
  Only two out of 100 directors felt safe to report that 
"everything is fine as is." 
<H5>  Accent on Production </H5>
  In this connection, of unquestionable interest are the 
answers to the new question included in the September survey 
(see Table 4). 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It is worth noting that there are very few who hesitated to 
answer this question. The directors' position was clear: 
Two-thirds of them placed emphasis on factors related to 
stimulation of production. Of course, this does not mean that 
they are against slowing down inflation. It is just that the 
people who know the practice of economic life do not believe in 
the effectiveness of managing the Russian economy solely through 
operations in the monetary market. 
<H5>  Investment Needed </H5>
  In the investment sphere, the third quarter of 1993 has not 
brought any perceptible changes, either. As one could see from 
Table 1, the respondents appraised the real volume of capital 
investment in September 1993 as 49 percent of the March 1993 
level and predicted 46 percent for March 1994. They put the 
level of realization of the production plans for April-September 
1993 at 54 percent, which is not different from similar 
appraisals made in March and June 1993 (53-55 percent). More 
than half of the enterprises (52-56 percent) have not purchased 
any equipment at all in the third quarter of 1993 (in the first 
half of the year this indicator fluctuated between 47 and 57 
percent). 
  Neither was there practically any change with respect to the 
reasons causing the decline of investment. In evaluating the 
reasons that had been primarily responsible for hampering 
investment at the enterprise, the respondents, as before, were 
asked to mark no more than three of the reply options listed 
(see Table 5). The data in this table, received in January, 
March, and June 1993, have already been published, but the 
replies received in September are being published for the first 
time. The set of questions in the questionnaires has been 
changed somewhat, but it does not affect the summary results.

15. Other reasons    6              8            3           8 


  In this respect, too, the causes of the decline have 
dramatically shifted into the financial sphere: investment 
growth was increasingly hampered by money 
barriers--upward-creeping prices of investment goods, interest 
rate on credit resources, the growing shortage of ruble means 
and the increase in enterprises' aggregate debt. The weight of 
impact of these four factors follows the lead of the rising cost 
of credit. Other factors clearly do not have any perceptible 
influence. 
  It is probably worth noting the absolutely absurd phenomenon 
of an increase in the share of the respondents (from 5 to 12 
percent) in whose opinion increased investment is hampered by 
existing excess production capacities. In September 1993 about 
one-third of the respondents (32 percent) declared the presence 
of excess production capacities in relation to the volume of 
demand expected within the next 12 months. This was in the 
environment of a decline in an absolute volume of production 
apparatus (in September 1993 it was 8 percent smaller than a 
year ago); in the environment where the share of capital 
investment in the total volume of enterprise turnover amounted 
in April-September 1993 to only 4 percent, where 13 percent of 
existing production capacities had been unprofitable over the 
past six months, where 7 percent of currently existing 
production capacities most likely would never be used, and where 
only 15 percent of credit obtained is being directed into 
capital investment. 
  Thus, the "excess" production capacities undoubtedly merely 
represent idled equipment that have ended up being such as a 
result of a crisis-induced stoppage of production. 
<H3>  Degradation and Primitivization of Economic Structure 
Continue </H3>
  During the period under consideration, there have been no 
serious changes in the investment structure, either (see Table 
6). 


Table 5. Some indicators of enterprises' capital investment structure over 
the past six months (as % of total volume of capital investment) 

Possible factors          Time the reply was received 

                          March 1993       June 1993       September 1993

(buildings, structures)

production capacities 

b) replacement of         56               59              65 
expended assets, 
modernization, repairs 


  Of course, in the environment of a sharp decline in 
investment, one cannot judge reliably the dynamics of its 
structure. This conclusion is also supported by fluctuating 
numbers in the table above. Still, an increasing share of 
investment in passive elements of production assets (an increase 
from 42 to 54 percent) and a low share of expenditures on 
expansion of production capacities (30-33 percent) evidence a 
continuing degradation of the production apparatus and the 
accompanying primitivization of the economic structure. 
<H5>  Innovation: A Rollback to Primitivism </H5>
  The same primitivization processes take place in the sphere 
of innovation as well. The June questionnaire contained a number 
of questions characterizing the process of innovation at 
enterprises. 
  It turned out that in 1992-1993 almost two-thirds of the 
respondent enterprises (65 percent) introduced innovations (new 
or improved production or technology). However, also in almost 
two-thirds (63 percent) among these innovations, the change 
amounted predominantly to changing production rather than 
technology. The result was that 26 percent of the products in 
the total structure first came on the market in 1992-1993. 
  The analysis of respondents' replies shows a clear increase 
in the elements of primitive methods in introducing innovation: 
ninety percent of the respondents indicated that the bulk of the 
research and design work with respect to innovations had been 
done in-house; only 6 percent said that this work had been 
carried by a state research institute, and 4 percent--by private 
research organizations. Also, let us not forget that the 
respondents do not represent large and major enterprises. This 
means that economic realities force even the "mid-level" to 
develop "homegrown" research and development capabilities. 
  Of course, the experience of many foreign companies presents 
quite a few examples of highly effective work of small 
collectives, who draw in their work on the achievements of 
strong basic research concentrated in academies and 
universities, which are reasonably well financed by the state 
and major companies. But the Russian disintegration of research 
and development is taking place in an environment of the 
catastrophic decline of the prestige and the impoverishment of 
national basic science and the system of higher professional 
education. 
  The editors of ROSSIYSKIY EKONOMICHESKIY BAROMETR asked 
whether enterprises attempted to obtain credit for 
innovation-related investment projects in 1992-1993. The replies 
showed that more than half of all respondents (54 percent) had 
attempted to obtain targeted state loans for these projects, but 
only one out of four had succeeded. Forty percent of respondents 
were bold enough to turn to a commercial bank for help, but only 
one out of three got it. As a result, a majority of the 
respondents who had introduced innovation had neither a targeted 
state loan (85 percent) nor a commercial bank credit (86 
percent). 
  The replies to the same July questionnaire enable us to form 
a certain idea of the goals pursued by enterprises in the 
process of innovation introduced in 1992-1993 (see Table 7).

  As we can see, these undertakings are essentially of an 
accidental nature and apparently are necessitated by the 
imperative to somehow stay afloat. 
<H5>  Economic Reform </H5>
  As already noted, 70 percent of the respondent enterprises 
are no longer owned by the state. In October 1993 two-thirds of 
the respondents (62 percent) reported that their enterprises 
already have been privatized. On average, this has happened nine 
months before the survey. Twenty-nine percent of respondents 
replied that they were planning to privatize within the current 
year; 6 percent did not have such plans; and only 3 percent of 
the respondents replied that their enterprises were not subject 
to privatization. 
  The recent nature and incompleteness of the processes make 
the evaluation of how the respondents perceive the government's 
current economic policy very difficult. Even more so since it is 
far too early to make unequivocal conclusions on what kind of 
impact privatization has on the economic life of enterprises. 
  The program that tabulates the survey data enables us to 
differentiate replies received from directors of both privatized 
and nonprivatized enterprises. We hope to present the results to 
DELOVOY MIR readers at a later date. 
  Right now we will show an updated (as compared to the report 
on the results of the first half of 1993) summary of enterprise 
directors's replies regarding their attitude toward the current 
economic policy of the government (see Tables 8, 9, and 10). 
Please note that in the previous report (DELOVOY MIR, 28 August 
1993, p. 10) the months in these tables had been moved one 
forward (for instance, the March column showed February data, 
the June column--May data, and so on).

Table 10. What has been the result of the economic policy of the government 
for your enterprise as compared to other Russian enterprises? (% of

gained (or lost less 
than others) 


  Let us repeat: So far, there is clearly too little data to 
produce a reliable judgment with respect to the opinion of 
directors of medium-sized Russian enterprises. Also, as the 
replies above show, the spread of opinions among the respondents 
on this issue is quite considerable. 
  In August 1993 the share of those who did not understand the 
economic policy of the government has increased perceptibly (to 
32 percent as compared to 15 percent in May), as well as of 
those who do not believe this policy is correct (to 30 percent 
as compared to 17 percent in May). At the same time, the share 
of those who understand this policy (8 percent) and consider it 
correct (2 percent) remained very low. 
  However, among the same respondents, the share of those who 
lost because of implementation of this policy has declined 
somewhat (to 42 percent in August as compared to 46 percent in 
May and 51 percent in February), and the share of those who 
"held their ground" has increased (to 46 percent in August as 
compared to 35 percent in May and 41 percent in February). 
However, the share of those who believe they have gained was 
lower in August (12 percent) than in May (20 percent), but 
higher than in February (8 percent). 
<H5>  Brief Conclusions </H5>
  1. The directors' responses on the results of the third 
quarter of 1993 have not brought anything substantially new in 
the appraisal of the economic crisis situation. The spectrum of 
their opinions showed increasingly clearly the stagnant nature 
of the decline. 
  2. At the same time, as the elements of structural changes 
noted above have shown, enterprises are somehow adapting to the 
new economic environment. This looks more, however, like a 
struggle for survival on the road of increasing primitivization 
of production and "relying on internal resources." 
  3. The results of the third quarter of 1993 survey do not 
detect an approaching economic pick-up, which is evidenced first 
and foremost by the decline in investment and degradation of the 
production apparatus. 
  4. The directors' appraisals clearly register a progressing 
financial crisis. One may also state that a majority of 
directors of monitored enterprises lean toward the conclusion 
that the search for a way out should go in the direction of 
giving priority to stimulation of production and shifting the 
accent into this sphere from the monetary policy by itself. 
  5. Finally, one cannot fail to notice that in their 
forecasts 
several months ahead, the directors consistently err in their 
evaluation of the future financial situation. Such repeated 
errors lead us to different generalizations. One could, of 
course, accuse the directors corps of a collective lack of 
competency. But one may also approach it differently: Do not 
these persistent errors reflect a certain artificial nature of 
forming the current financial situation, its conflict with the 
real state of affairs and the needs of the real Russian economy? 
Perhaps those who form the financial policy should look more 
attentively at themselves in the collective mirror of directors' 
opinions.

"Russian Industry in January 1994: A Forecast"] 
  [Text] In appraising the situation in Russian 
industry in January 1994, we have first and foremost to take 
into account that, first, there are only 19 working days in this 
month; second, that many enterprises have decided to extend the 
New Year holidays to 10 January; third, that most enterprises 
have not yet signed contracts for deliveries of raw materials, 
fuels, parts, and components for 1994 and deliveries of finished 
products; and fourth, that the level of production in January 
1993 was extremely low, which will make it possible for a number 
of production sectors to surpass this level in 1994 while still 
not reaching the level of 1992, let alone 1989. 
  Production of more than 80 percent of varieties of the 
output 
produced will decline in a majority of sectors. An especially 
significant decline in output (by more than 20 percent) will 
take place in a number of sectors in the metallurgical complex; 
machine building; the chemical industry; the timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industry; production of complex 
home appliances; and light industry and the food processing 
industry. 
  The index of the physical volume of industrial production 
will measure in January at 0.854 in Russia as a whole (in 
November it measured 0.847, as compared to the forecasted value 
of 0.853--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 November 1993); that is, 
production will decline by 14.6 percent. The average daily 
volume of production will decline by 16.8 percent as compared to 
January 1993 (in November it declined by 17.3 percent as 
compared to the forecasted 16.7 percent--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 
November 1993). 
  In continuation of the trend of the second half of 1993, 
enterprises' financial instability caused by the payments crisis 
remains the most important factor causing production decline. 
  For instance, according to a Goskomstat [State Committee on 
Statistics] of Russia report, as of 1 November 1993 past due 
arrears on the part of customers in paying their suppliers 
amounted to 6.371 trillion rubles [R] and increased over the 
month by 22.3 percent. In December, according to preliminary 
estimates, past due arrears also increased. There is no reason 
to assume that the volume of past due arrears will stop 
increasing in January 1994. Moreover, one may predict with a 
high degree of certainty that it will increase. 
  If we look at expected volumes of main categories of energy 
resources (see table), one may get the impression that the 
situation emerging in the fuels and power generation sector in 
January 1994 is somewhat better than that in January 1993. 
  And it is true that electric power generation at 
general-use power stations will increase by 1.2 billion kw/hr (1 
percent) as compared to January 1993. This entire increase will 
come from increased power output at nuclear power stations--by 9 
percent. Power output at thermal and hydroelectric power 
stations will remain at the 1993 level. In the total volume of 
power generation, the share of its output generated by thermal 
power stations will decrease from 72.3 percent in January 1993 
to 71.6 percent in January 1994; at hydroelectric power 
stations--from 15.8 percent to 15.6 percent; and at nuclear 
power stations it will increase from 11.9 percent to 12.8 
percent. One may hardly say in all seriousness, however, that 
production decline in electric power generation will be halted 
and growth will begin. As already noted above, the level of 
January 1993, against which comparisons are being made, was 
extremely low, and therefore this only appears to be going well. 
If we compare electric power generation forecasted for January 
1994 with the volume produced in January 1989, we will see a 
10-percent decline instead of growth. 
  Oil production will decline as compared to January 1993 by 
3.5 million tonnes (12 percent) and will amount to 26.2 million 
tonnes. This will be precipitated to a considerable extent by a 
decline in production in Tyumen Oblast (by more than 13 
percent), which accounts for almost two-thirds of the entire oil 
production in Russia. 
  The decline in the volume of oil production will lead to a 
7-percent drop in primary oil refining, which will cause a 
decline in the production of automotive gasoline by 14 percent, 
diesel fuel--by 13 percent, and boiler oil--by 9 percent. It 
should be noted that the depth of oil processing declined 
somewhat in 1993 and measured at 62.8 percent as compared to 
63.9 percent in 1992. 
  In the gas industry, the volume of production in 
January 1994 will drop off by 2 percent and will amount to 56 
billion cubic meters. The trend of a decline in gas production, 
which has manifested itself since May 1993, had been caused to a 
considerable extent by the insolvency of many consumers in the 
near abroad countries. In appears that this trend will continue 
in 1994, at least through the first half of it. Because of the 
lack of money, the volume of work on construction of surface 
facilities at Urengoy, Yamburg, and other fields has been 
curtailed considerably, which probably will affect the state of 
affairs in the industry in the beginning of 1994. 
  The coal industry began to gradually pull out of a 
pre-strike state, in which it had lingered for more than a month 
and a half (in the beginning of December, a three-day strike 
took place in Vorkuta). The industry's instability in 1993 will 
produce aftereffects in the first half of 1994 as well. An 
especially great impact on the state of affairs in coal basins 
comes from very substantial arrears in consumer payments for 
coal already shipped, which is unlikely to diminish in the 
beginning of the year. Overall, in January coal production will 
amount to 26.9 million tonnes (99 percent of the 1993 level). 
Production of coking coal will increase over the month by 4 
percent. 
  The level of production in ferrous metallurgy in 
January 1994 will be affected the most by the shortage of raw 
materials and fuel resources. Iron ore production will decline 
by 5 percent. Scrap metal deliveries will amount to no more than 
50-55 percent of normal needs. Coke burning will decline by 12 
percent, despite the fact that the output of coking coal will 
increase, as already noted above. Because of metallurgical 
enterprises' considerable arrears in paying coal producers, the 
latter are in no hurry to ship coal to consumers. The state of 
affairs in the sector also will be affected by a reduced demand 
for metallurgical output on the part of the machine building 
industry, the VPK [military-industrial complex], and the 
construction complex. As a result, in January 1994 pig iron 
smelting will fall off by 20 percent, that of steel--by 22 
percent, production of finished rolled metal--by 16 percent, and 
steel pipe--by 49 percent. In continuation of the 1993 trend, 
production of many advanced varieties of metal products will 
continue to decline, since the demand for them is steadily 
declining because of extremely high prices. 
  The situation in machine building in January 1994 
will be extremely hard. Over the past months there has been a 
tremendous decline in solvent demand for many--first and 
foremost science-intensive--varieties of output. For instance, 
production of metal-cutting machine tools and drop forges with 
the numeric program control over 11 months of 1993 declined by a 
factor of four to six, since prices for these items increased 
several-fold while qualitative characteristics remained the 
same. The industry is in an extremely difficult financial 
situation: As of 1 November, customers owed to machinebuilding 
enterprises R1.2721 trillion. 
  Production decline will occur with respect to most varieties 
of the output produced. For instance, the output of 
metal-cutting machine tools will drop off by 41 percent, drop 
forges--by 57 percent, spinning machines--by 13 percent, 
looms--by 17 percent, bulldozers--by 41 percent, excavators--by 
13 percent, main line freight railcars--by 80 percent, main line 
passenger railcars--by 44 percent, trolley buses--by 28 percent, 
trucks--by 34 percent, buses--by 11 percent, tractors--by 76 
percent, tractor-drawn attachments--by 84 percent, grain 
harvesting combines--by 76 percent, and friction-free ball 
bearings--by 52 percent. 
  The situation with respect to production of main line 
electric locomotives should be noted separately. In 1993 there 
have been months when not a single main line electric locomotive 
was produced. We forecast a similar situation for January 1994, 
with zero output of electric locomotives. 
  As before, production of passenger cars will be on a rise: 
In 
January, it will increase by 1 percent. Also, the output of main 
line diesel locomotives will double. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry in 
January 1994 the situation will continue to worsen. Because of 
the difficult financial situation (as of 1 November customers 
owed the industry enterprises R1.0195 trillion) and shortage of 
components and raw materials, including those obtained through 
imports, production of most varieties of the output produced 
will continue to decline. This will affect first and foremost 
the output of most important producer products. For instance, 
the output of synthetic ammonia will drop off by 16 percent; 
sulfuric acid, by 25 percent; calcinated soda, by 49 percent; 
and caustic soda, by 22 percent. 
  Production of mineral fertilizer continues to 
decline; its output will fall off by 24 percent in January. 
Financial difficulties experienced by enterprises because of 
nonpayment on the part of consumers, shortage of mineral and 
chemical raw materials resulting from depletion of mineral 
reserves, the decline in demand caused by rapidly rising prices, 
as well as a number of other reasons have led to a steady 
decline in production over a lengthy period of time, which is 
unlikely to be overcome in the near future. 
  The output of chemical thread and fiber will 
decline by 30 percent. 
  A difficult situation exists at enterprises producing 
microbiological fodder protein, whose output will 
decline in January by 46 percent. Enterprises producing 
microbiological fodder protein out of oil hydrocarbons and 
timber material were on the verge of stoppage at the end of the 
year. 
  The situation is unlikely to improve in the timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industry. So far, attempts 
to stabilize the situation with respect to supply of timber 
input materials to woodworking sector enterprises have been 
unsuccessful. At the end of 1993, timber logging enterprise so 
far have been unable to take advantage of the most favorable 
period for logging. The outtake of round timber continues to 
decline, to the point of 33 percent in January, which will lead 
to a 35-percent reduction in the output of commercial wood. 
Shortage of raw timber necessitates cutbacks in the production 
of sawn lumber, which will decline by 32 percent; plywood which 
will decline by 29 percent; wood-chip board--by 11 percent; 
paper--by 15 percent; and cardboard--by 30 percent. 
  In the construction materials industry a certain 
pick-up has been observed over the past several months. It is 
related to a considerable extent to a rise in individual housing 
construction, which resulted in an increased demand for cement, 
construction brick, etc. In January the output of cement will 
increase as compared to 1993 by 11 percent; asbestos-cement pipe 
and couplings, by 50 percent; and pliable roofing materials, by 
4 percent. The output of construction brick will remain at the 
1993 level. In this respect, we have to keep in mind that in 
January 1993 the output of many varieties of products was 
extremely low. Therefore, an increase in the output of some or 
other product in January 1994 as compared to January 1993 does 
not always signal a trend of overcoming the decline. At the same 
time, the output of preassembled ferroconcrete will decline by 
12 percent; construction brick, by 10 percent; asbestos-cement 
sheeting, by 30 percent; and window glass, by 22 percent. 
  In January 1994 the trend toward a decline in the output of 
most categories of complex home appliances will 
persist. Production of washing machines will decline by 35 
percent; electric vacuum cleaners, by 46 percent; tape 
recorders, by 40 percent; radio receivers, by 36 percent; sewing 
machines, by 60 percent; and bicycles, by 48 percent. The output 
of television sets, which had increased in 1993 over several 
months, will drop off in January by 14 percent. And only the 
output of refrigerators and freezers will increase, by 10 
percent. 
  To a considerable extent, the decline in the output of home 
appliances stems from the diminished demand for it, due to high 
prices and the fact that imported goods of higher quality are 
widely available. 
  In light industry production of cotton fabrics 
will continue to rise in January, increasing overall by 71 
percent. This is contingent on the assumption that the contracts 
for cotton deliveries from Central Asia will be fulfilled. As to 
the demand for items made of cotton fabric, it is quite stable. 
Production of other most important industry products will 
continue to decline, however: woolen fabrics, by 32 percent; 
silk fabrics, by 27 percent; knitwear, by 16 percent; hosiery, 
by 2 percent; and footwear, by 26 percent.
