<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma's </F>
Committee for Economic Policy and doctor of economic sciences: 
"Prospect for Harmony: Sergey Glazyev's Proposals for Restoring 
Civil Peace in Society and Improving Russia's Economy"] 
  [Text] Achieving broad social harmony is an important 
condition for the success of large-scale social and economic 
changes. The government's unexpected reorganization opens up 
definite opportunities for restoring civil peace and achieving 
social harmony on the main social and economic policy avenues 
for the sake of the population and the state. 
  It cannot be ruled out that this is the last chance which, 
if 
not used, will put us into the irreversible process of 
unleashing an avalanche of social conflicts and the 
disintegration of society. 
  The executive branch, which has put itself above society and 
the law since September of last year, should take the first 
step. Only one true avenue exists for this step and creates the 
preconditions for achieving success. It is made up of the 
following components. 
  First. The government should propose a program to 
get the country out of its crisis -- a program that could become 
the basis for achieving social harmony and consolidating the 
efforts of a majority of the population's active layers. Such a 
program should provide for concrete measures understood by 
everyone and aimed at reviving economic activity and increasing 
responsibility for effective management. 
  First of all, order should be introduced in the state 
administration itself. It is necessary to establish control over 
the management of state property, the use of natural resources 
and state finances, the observance of foreign trade laws, and 
the functioning of the infrastructure. Establishing control 
assumes not only overcoming mismanagement and corruption but 
also introducing clear-cut and rather strict responsibility for 
the efficient use of state property and the proper performance 
of state control functions. 
  Introducing order in the management of state property and 
finances and establishing control over the use of natural 
resources and the observance of foreign trade laws will permit 
the state's income to be increased considerably and the 
discipline of state expenditures to be raised. It will provide 
an opportunity to understand once and for all the real 
redistribution flows of resources and national wealth. This will 
permit opportunities to be found for conducting an effective 
policy in the area of stimulating the development of scientific 
and industrial potentials and a social and structural policy. 
Such a policy could include: determining the priorities in 
structurally reorganizing the economy, adopting state programs 
for their realization, establishing special financial 
development institutions to stimulate investment activity, and 
rationalizing the tax system and the existing social insurance 
system. 
  This set of measures should replace the cellular 
distribution 
policy for preferential credits and budget appropriations, which 
is extremely convenient for those who love to fish in troubled 
waters and which is inaccessible to any honest examination. 
Credit emission should be put in order and formalized so that 
credits to finance the national economy will reach production 
facilities and contribute to realizing the priorities of the 
economy's structural reorganization and not whirl around in 
commercial bank accounts, incredibly enriching the people 
participating in their distribution. 
  A clear and sound structural policy should replace the 
present vague practice of granting benefits and privileges to 
court firms and branches and the administration of state 
expenditures according to the principle: "We will give to this 
but we will not give to that." State purchases and the granting 
of benefits should be done clearly in accordance with structural 
reorganization programs and in accordance with a clearly tested 
and dependable procedure that excludes the arbitrariness of 
bureaucrats. 
  Conducting an effective policy to revive the economy assumes 
not only introducing order into the executive branch system but 
also establishing the appropriate preconditions in industrial 
production organizations. 
  The extraordinarily rapid and massive privatization of a 
large part of the state enterprises has brought about the 
destruction of the large production associations, which produced 
complicated types of products, and the formation of an eroded 
and extremely ineffective structure of property relationships. 
Today, the country's economy consists of barely viable 
production and economic units, which are poorly linked with each 
other and which are being formed in place of large production 
associations. They do not possess the production flexibility 
required to survive on their own and belong to a nebulous group 
of stockholders consisting of labor collective members, the 
enterprise board of directors and the retainers of the local 
bodies of authority. 
  If one considers that the overwhelming majority of banks 
belong to state and privatized enterprises, it is not difficult 
to diagnose -- as a result of the massive privatization, we have 
received a property relationship structure that is closer to the 
Yugoslav model of the 1970s than to that of a developed country 
with a market economy. This model is characterized by economic 
inefficiency (the eating away of profits, low investment and 
innovation activity, strong pressure for an increase in credit 
emissions, and high inflation) and political danger (the 
economic foundation for separatist movements and the 
disintegration of the country's economic space). 
  The set of measures required to rationalize the industrial 
production structure and correct the violations in production 
cooperation and the gaps in the technological chains for 
manufacturing complicated products, which have occurred as a 
result of the adopted privatization model, includes: eliminating 
limitations on vertical integration and the reintegration of 
related enterprises (including amalgamations, cross-ownership of 
stock shares, liquidations, the organization of holding 
companies, etc.), removing the ban on participating in the 
privatization of enterprises with more than a 25-percent share 
of state ownership, and stimulating the establishment of 
financial industrial groups. 
  The same thing pertains to the state's import and export 
operations. Strict implementation of already adopted decisions 
concerning the competitive distribution of export orders for 
state needs and the competitive determination of firms to 
deliver centralized imports and strict observance of currency 
laws and export control norms must be achieved. A situation 
where government departments, which are responsible for 
purchasing and distributing centrally imported goods, delay 
transferring the earnings from their sale to the budget for 
months, essentially concealing an embezzlement of state property 
in enormous amounts, is intolerable at a time when the payment 
of wages to doctors, scientists and teachers is not being done 
and defense orders are not being paid for under the pretext that 
there are not enough budget revenues. 
  There is no possibility here to expound in detail on 
recommendations for forming a wise economic policy responsive to 
the interests of the population and the state. Its elaboration 
will take quite a bit of time; however, it is already important 
to take decisive steps now that will demonstrate the executive 
branch's firm intention to introduce order -- if only in its own 
departments -- and to stop the embezzlement of state property 
and violations of the law, which are prevalent both in the 
machinery of the federal bodies of power and in the local areas. 
  Second. Along with the adoption of anti-crisis 
measures and the introduction of order into the management of 
state property and finances, the government should demonstrate 
the ability and will to solve the more acute social problems. 
This, first of all, concerns protecting the vulnerable layers of 
the population against hunger and illness (especially children, 
half of whom live in conditions below the subsistence minimum 
and are malnourished), supplying the population with housing and 
reconstructing available housing, preventing the destruction of 
the secondary and preschool educational system, maintaining 
large-scale medical support at an acceptable level, and 
preparing for refugees from the former union republics. It is 
also important to begin reforming the social insurance system 
immediately. 
  Third. The state's leaders should formulate an 
understandable idea of national rebirth, which is close to 
everyone. The population cannot be satisfied with abstract ideas 
of freedom and democracy and suffer appreciable losses for the 
sake of implementing poorly understood reforms. In order to 
achieve broad public consent and the consolidation of efforts to 
overcome the crisis, a popular ideology is needed -- one which 
would reveal the nation-wide goals of the social and economic 
development which the state is following in its domestic and 
foreign policy. 
  Along with the ideas of freedom and the welfare of the 
individual, the following should be included in these goals: 
  -- the building of a powerful Russian state capable of 
defending its citizens against internal and foreign threats and 
pursuing in the world an independent policy to protect its 
national interest; 
  -- the maintaining of Russia's leading position in the area 
of scientific and technological development, industry, energy, 
and agriculture; 
  -- the development of a national self-consciousness and the 
rebirth of national culture; the acquiring of a sense of 
national pride and historic continuity in the mass consciousness. 
  The state's leaders should demonstrate their devotion to 
these goals and the ability to achieve them. 
  The Federal Assembly, in which all major political movements 
and almost all subjects of the federation are represented today, 
should take on the main work to achieve broad social harmony 
regarding the prospective avenues for the country's social and 
economic development and the extension of the reforms. 
  The main obstacle on this path is the ruling political 
grouping's line for radicalizing public opinion and splitting 
society, which has been in effect until recently. Right up to 
the 12 December elections, this line helped the radicals in 
government to maintain their power despite the evident failures 
in the social and economic policy and the pauperization of a 
large part of the population. The spreading of the myth of a 
communist threat and the lack of an alternative to the policy 
being conducted permitted the radicals to maintain power in 
1993, successfully slip the referendum in and fire on a 
parliament, which the people had elected, with impunity. The 
elections, however, clearly demonstrated the development of a 
social consciousness which gradually acquired an immunity 
against the actions of political propaganda that would make a 
fool of one. The next attempt to introduce a split in society by 
intimidating politicians with a fascist threat also fell through. 
  The main threat to the country and its population comes from 
continuing the adventurist and insufficiently considered policy, 
which has given birth to chaos and discord and which has led to 
an unprecedented drop in production and the lowering of the 
standard of living in peacetime. It is clear to everyone, who 
has not lost the ability to think soberly, that it is not the 
resistance by some conservative political forces to the 
progressive reforms but the inability to make these reforms 
correctly and the errors in the economic, social, regional and 
cultural policy that were the main reason for the swiftly 
deepening crisis. In order to rein in this crisis and begin to 
gradually extricate ourselves from the abyss, it is necessary to 
stop looking for enemies, admit errors, eliminate animosity, and 
unite the forces of all political and public organizations for 
the sake of preserving the main thing -- a sovereign Russian 
state and people. Today, the irreversible destruction of the 
state and the degradation of the population really threaten 
Russia. This process has already embraced a significant portion 
of the country's scientific, industrial and cultural potential. 
The sharpness of this threat is not a bit less than that of the 
threat in the time of the Great Troubles during the 16th century 
or, if one looks for analogies in modern history, during the 
time of the civil war from 1918-1919 or the winter of 1941-1942. 
  Opposing this threat should be the main subject of concern 
for all authority structures and political and public movements 
today. The risk is too great to continue rocking the boat any 
more and arousing social conflicts in order to maintain power. 
It is necessary to extinguish political and economic radicalism 
of any stripe and suspend heartless radicals, adventurists and 
embezzlers of state property from making decisions in the 
executive power structures. Then, the road will be open to 
achieving national harmony on the general approach to carrying 
out social and economic transformations in the interests of the 
population.

"Arbitrary Rule Will Not Go!"] 
  [Text] Social Insurance. Is it necessary to mention 
what an enormous role this has been called upon to play in 
providing assistance to the working individual, improving his 
health and treating him? As long as trade unions managed 
Russia's Social Insurance Fund, it completely coped with these 
goals. 
  Last year, as is known, an edict of the Russian Federation's 
president transferred the fund's management to the government 
"with the participation of the all-Russian trade unions." 
  At the time, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA and other publications warned 
the people: This document unties the hands of the executive 
branch's civil servants to patch holes in the state budget using 
social insurance, as has already occurred with the pension fund. 
  Seemingly, this forecast has started to come true. On 17 
January, Yuriy Shatyrenko, the fund's chairman, adopted a decree 
without considering the opinion of the trade unions and the 
board of directors. It ordered them to abolish the fund's 
separate central branch departments and transfer the property, 
which had been acquired using social insurance assets, to the 
fund's central executive board of directors. On 21 January, this 
same Yu. Shatyrenko sent a teletype message to the heads of the 
regional administrations about suspending the issuing of joint 
stock in the trade unions' sanitarium and health resort system. 
  It is impossible to call the actions of the Social Insurance 
Fund's leadership anything other than arbitrariness since they 
were completely contrary to a whole series of legal acts. We 
will mention only the main ones. In the new Russian Federation 
Constitution, it is written: "Any normative legal acts affecting 
the rights, freedoms and duties of the individual and citizen 
cannot be applied if they have not been published officially for 
general information." The Social Insurance Fund decree has not 
been published. 
  Let us also recall the president's edict, according to 
which, 
first, the new procedure for managing social insurance is called 
a temporary one -- until the Federal Assembly adopts special 
legislation. Second, management was entrusted to two subjects 
possessing equal rights: the government and the trade unions. 
Third, it was also ordered that "the existing procedure for 
paying state social insurance and for financing expenditures for 
these purposes should be retained in enterprises, 
establishments, organizations, and other economic agencies 
regardless of the form of ownership until legislation is 
adopted." In other words, the procedure for paying through 
branch and regional departments of the Social Insurance Fund of 
the all-Russian trade unions should exist even today because 
nothing else existed at the time the president's edict was 
published. 
  Conclusion: The fund's new masters have displayed not only 
an 
extreme lack of respect for the country's constitution, which 
has direct effect, but also for their management partners -- the 
trade unions -- and, in them, for millions of workers also. 
Mikhail Shmakov, the chairman of the Federation of Independent 
Trade Unions of Russia, and Vyacheslav Goncharov, his deputy, 
who were alarmed by this development of events, met with Yu. 
Shatyrenko, chairman of the Russian Federation's Social 
Insurance Fund. A joint teletype message was sent to the heads 
of the local administrations and the directors of the regional 
trade associations as a result of the discussions. It informed 
them that the fund was retracting its claims to the property of 
the trade unions' sanitarium and health resort installations. 
  The directors of the branch trade unions, which are in the 
Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, unanimously 
spoke out in their meeting also for abrogating the fund 
chairman's decree of 17 January. 
  Word for Word 
  Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent 
Trade Unions of Russia, said during the discussion of the 
critical situation that had been created: 
  "The leadership of the Social Insurance Fund and its 
chairman, Yu. Shatyrenko, assume that trade union activists have 
been so occupied with current social insurance matters on social 
principles that they will not continue further. No, it is 
necessary to continue the situation to the end: If the 
reorganized fund assumes all management and threatens another's 
property -- let it not count on us. Let it establish a new 
machinery whose size will increase by far. It will barely live 
on the percentages, which are withheld from wages for social 
insurance. Nothing will remain for payments. 
  "Let them know in the fund that our protest is not a mutiny 
by the Federation of Independent Trade Union of Russia leaders. 
The boycott will be universal -- from the top to the bottom. 
  "We will invite Yu. Shatyrenko to visit us and we will put 
the question to him point-blank: Either he revokes his decrees 
or we will be forced to look for other ways."

Economic Problems of the Transition Period Laboratory of Current 
Trends Surveys: "Expectations of Continuing Decline Persist"] 
  [Text] Another December survey of directors of 162 
industrial enterprises in Moscow and Moscow Oblast using a 
unified European testing methodology have not revealed any 
optimism. Production is folding fastest at enterprises in the 
light and woodworking sectors. Dissatisfaction with the volume 
of output has reached a record level of 83 percent in December. 
For 81 percent of enterprises the demand in December was 
inadequate.

<H5>  Production, Demand, and Inventories </H5>
  In December the surveyed enterprises mainly reported an 
accelerating decline of production. The balance differential 
(the indicator of the speed of change in the process) fell over 
one month from -37 percent to -41 percent. The general 
acceleration of the decline was fueled mainly by enterprises in 
the woodworking and light industries, where the balances 
registered at -56 percent and -50 percent. At the same time, the 
pace of decline remains stable at machine-building 
enterprises--about -40 percent. 
  The continuing production decline resulted in increased 
dissatisfaction over the state of affairs at enterprises. The 
share of "below norm" answers reached a record level of 83 
percent in December. In December 1992 this indicator stood at 66 
percent. The traditionally high dissatisfaction with the 
December volume of output in machine building (80-91 percent) 
was "fortified" by an increase in the share of "below norm" 
replies at enterprises in the woodworking (from 61 percent to 89 
percent) and light (from 68 percent to 83 percent) industries. 
The situation has improved somewhat in the construction 
industry--the result of our construction workers' habit for 
shock labor in the end of the year. Another positive (although 
unclear for how long) factor was an increased hope for 
production growth among enterprises that consider their level of 
production "below normal." While in November the share of such 
hopes registered at 7 percent, in December it was 12 percent. 
However, this category of respondents also displayed a certain 
degree of pessimism--further decline in production has been 
forecast at 46 percent of such enterprises (38 percent in 
October and 40 percent in November). 
  A decline in satisfaction with the demand for the output 
produced continued in December. The share of "below normal" 
replies set a new record (81 percent). A decline in demand has 
been noted by enterprises in all industry groups, with the 
exception of the construction materials industry and printing. 
The maximum number of "below normal" replies was received in the 
light (89 percent vs. 73 percent in November), machine-building 
(87 percent vs. 85 percent in November), and woodworking (67 
percent vs. 62 percent in November) industries. 
  Demand limitations are beginning to exert a corresponding 
influence on the behavior of an increasingly greater number of 
goods producers--already 49 percent of the enterprises that 
consider the demand for their output unsatisfactory foresee 
cutbacks in production (the analogous indicator for November was 
40 percent). The neutral reaction to insufficient demand also 
declined--in December only 40 percent of the enterprises with 
insufficient demand intended to sustain the current level of 
production. Previously, this indicator stood at 54-57 percent. 
  A sharp decline in demand, noted by enterprises in 
October-November 1993, immediately resulted in the increase of 
excess inventories of finished products. However, cutbacks in 
production, which did indeed follow the decline in demand, 
permitted enterprises in general to halt the growth of excess 
inventories. Nevertheless, the share of "above normal" replies 
reached 78 percent in the light industry (63 percent in 
November), 56 percent in woodworking (38 percent in November), 
and 50 percent in the construction industry (40 percent in 
November). At machine-building plants excess inventories 
declined from 56 percent to 49 percent, and in the food 
processing industry the "below normal" replies are more frequent 
than "above normal." Still, only about one-half (48 percent) of 
the enterprises with excess inventories plan to cut back 
production in the next few months. 
<H5>  Expected Changes in Production and Prices </H5>
  In December increasingly more enterprises expected a 
production decline. The share of "will decline" answers reached 
42 percent--a record level for the past 15 months. The hope of 
maintaining the existing level of production declined to 46 
percent (54 percent in November). The highest expectations of 
cutbacks have been registered in the petrochemical industry (63 
percent of enterprises), machine building (50 percent), and the 
light industry (39 percent). At enterprises in the 
metallurgical, food processing, and printing industry the 
prevalent answer was "no change." Production growth is possible 
only in the woodworking industry, where the share of "will 
increase" answers (44 percent) is higher than that of "will 
decline" answers (23 percent). 
  The expected changes in the volume of production affect the 
producers' pricing policy. Enterprises that foresee an increase 
in production are less likely to plan to raise prices on their 
products than enterprises that expect a decline in 
production--74 percent as compared to 84 percent. 
  Since the beginning of the fall, surveys register a decline 
in inflationary expectation in industry--the forecast of price 
increases for the output produced has dropped from 96 percent in 
September to 81 percent in December. A lower level of 
inflationary expectations was last registered in October 1992 
(79 percent). The smallest expectation of prices rising within 
the next few months are in the food processing industry (where 
the balance of "will increase"-"will decline" measured at 56 
percent), the construction industry (67 percent), and machine 
building (78 percent).

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Irina Demchenko: "The Ukrainian Is Becoming </F>
a Foreign Worker"] 
  [Text] By presidential decree, the Statute "On Recruiting 
and Utilizing Foreign Manpower in Russia" was introduced 
effective mid-December, in accordance with which citizens of any 
foreign state, including states of the near abroad, may receive 
jobs only by license and according to the quotas of each region 
for recruiting foreign manpower overall and by occupational 
specialty. Quotas have not been allocated, however, as the 
Russian Federal Migration Service has noted. 
  In the words of Vladimir Volokh, deputy director of the 
service, foreign workers, including Ukrainians, who are 
presently working in Russia must be "licensed" and appropriately 
registered. Otherwise they face threat of eviction. When job 
vacancies arise, priority in filling them now goes to Russian 
citizens according to the law; next in priority are refugees 
from the near abroad, then persons who reside permanently in 
Russia, and lastly--foreign workers. According to the new 
statute, the dumping of a national labor force is not permitted, 
i.e., a foreign citizen must receive no less for his labor than 
what a citizen of Russia would be paid in his position. True, as 
Vladimir Volokh noted, this international regulation is 
routinely violated in all countries, especially by small-scale 
private employers. A foreign worker has the right to receive the 
same types of medical, cultural, and sports-related services as 
do his Russian colleagues, as well as the same right to all 
types of social benefits, including accrued labor tenure by 
occupational specialty, compensation for injury incurred during 
the course of labor activity, and so forth. All these provisions 
apply not only to the worker himself, but to members of his 
family residing with him as well. 
  However, not a single Ukrainian traveling to Russia to earn 
money has to date been registered with the Directorate on Labor 
Migrant Affairs of the Federal Migration Service. The only 
exception is the rotating work crews that traditionally work at 
oil production enterprises in Siberia and the Far East. In 
Tyumen Oblast alone, according to the clearly understated 
assessment of directorate chief Grigoriy Barabanov, about 
150,000 Ukrainians are working at present, and in no way do all 
of these comprise rotating work crews. In total, the directorate 
believes, not fewer than 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians are working 
in Russia, and this number is increasing every day. No one in 
state organs knows--or, more accurately, they prefer not to 
know--what kind of discrimination these people are subject to on 
the job and in everyday life, and how dangerous for 
Ukrainians--and for Russians as well, incidentally--the chase 
after the "easy Russian ruble" is becoming, a pursuit that has 
encompassed the near abroad. 
  The migration service explains that the requirement for 
mandatory licensing does not apply to foreigners engaged in 
science or culture who are working at institutions established 
in Russia by intergovernmental agreement, crew members on ships 
at sea and river vessels, students undergoing on-the-job 
training at Russian enterprises, accredited journalists, 
lecturers, instructors, and certain other categories of citizens.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Kalinin, National Consumer Protection </F>
Fund general director, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent M. Gelman: 
"Rabkrin Is Returning . . . : Consumer Protection Is a Matter 
for Consumers Themselves"] 
  [Text] The law is the law. For it to work, the 
appropriate means for its implementation are required. For 
example, the vitality of the Criminal Code is supported by the 
police, the prosecutor's office, and the courts. But who is 
going to ensure the implementation of the Russian Federation's 
law "On Consumer Rights Protection," and how? Violations of 
those laws frequently bear the nature of criminally punishable 
acts. In practice, however, oversight over those rights falls 
out of the field of vision of the lawkeeping organs for some 
reason. And of the executive authorities as well. Therefore 
public organizations are compelled to be involved in oversight 
as well. 
  This may just be right. State organs alone could scarcely 
manage here. There is similar experience in the country at hand: 
at the dawn of Soviet power, a worker-peasant inspectorate for 
oversight over anything and everything was created--Rabkrin. In 
the recent past, a people's control committee functioned, for 
better or ill. 
  On the problems of consumer rights protection, which affects 
the country's entire population, DELOVOY MIR correspondent 
Moisey Gelman interviews the general director of the recently 
organized National Consumer Protection Fund, Aleksandr 
Kalinin. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, with what purpose was 
your fund created, and what are its functions and legal base? 
  [Kalinin] The Consumer Rights Fund is an extrabudgetary, 
independent, noncommercial, charitable organization with a 
social orientation. Its chief task is to unify the financial and 
intellectual potential of organizations and enterprises of all 
forms of property in order to implement the Russian Federation 
[RF] law "On Consumer Rights Protection." 
  The fund was created at the initiative of the RF State 
Committee on Antimonopoly Policy and the Support of New Economic 
Structures. It functions under the good offices of Russia's 
leading ministries and departments, which are under instructions 
to ensure state protection for the rights of consumers of goods, 
jobs, and services. The fund is financed out of institutional, 
membership, and sponsor contributions, as well as investment 
funds from its members. 
  The fund's founders and members include the RF Committee on 
Standardization, Measurement, and Certification [Gosstandart], 
the State Inspectorate for Trade, Goods Quality, and Consumer 
Rights Protection of the RF Committee on Trade, the RF Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, the Russian Goods and Raw Materials 
Exchange, the Moscow Goods Exchange, the Dialog-Bank, the Estra 
Financial-Industrial Company AO (joint-stock company), the 
Energogarant insurance joint-stock company, the Norilskiy Nikel 
concern, the Germes-Tsentr bank, the Soyuz-Germes AO, the 
Certification VNII (all-Russian scientific research institute), 
and others. 
  At present, the fund is implementing three programs: 
financial-economic, informational-propaganda, and 
organizational-methodological. It is trying to attract monetary 
funds and financing for its protection activities for the rights 
and legal interests of consumers and the support of the consumer 
movement, while taking into account the multiplicity of its 
forms and structures. It is also creating in Russia centers and 
laboratories for the independent consumer expert analysis and 
certification of goods, jobs, and services, the compilation of a 
list of goods that do not meet mandatory safety requirements, 
the organization of counter-advertising for the producers of 
those goods, the organization of consumers' legal defense, and 
the financing and implementation of programs for the training 
and retraining of specialists and expert auditors working in the 
organized consumer movement. 
  Moreover, the fund is participating in international 
programs, preparing proposals for Russia's government and goods 
producers on common state and regional programs for the 
development of the production of goods, jobs, and services, as 
well as facilitating the development of entrepreneurship and the 
formation of a competitive environment in the consumer market. 
  In order to carry out the tasks identified by the fund, 
centers have been organized for the assortment and quality of 
goods and services, technical expertise, and certification of 
items of automotive and tractor machine-building, as well as the 
training and retraining of personnel. An independent 
international center for the certification of goods and services 
for radiation safety and an information rights center for the 
protection of consumers are being created, as are centers for 
the independent consumer expert analysis of foods and the raw 
materials used in them, technical expertise, and certification 
of flammable fabrics, and others. 
  Departments and branches of the fund are also being created 
in various regions of Russia. Over the next couple of years, 
more than 80 are slated for creation; as of now there are 9. 
Their appearance has been facilitated by local organs of power 
and commercial structures. Contacts are being established with 
partners from the countries of the CIS and elsewhere abroad. 
After all, such funds abroad are actively defending the rights 
of consumers. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] What guides those wishing to join your fund or 
to help it? Are they moved by altruism or economic interest? 
  [Kalinin] There has always been some tension with 
"altruism." 
The market is forcing people to strive for checks and balances 
of mutual interests. Their motivations differ, however. For 
example, it is profitable for banks to support financial 
relations with us. The Norilskiy Nikel concern has an interest 
in social protection for its 170,000-person collective working 
under difficult conditions above the Arctic Circle. The 
difference between our fund and the various other consumer 
associations is that only juridical persons can be members of 
the fund; however, we render assistance, above all legal, to all 
consumers. With our small staff of nine, we are helped in this 
by more than 300 experts free of charge, among them scientists, 
economists, and jurists. 
  The main reason behind the fund, however, was to facilitate 
the implementation of consumer rights laws, above all through 
financing various programs (and in this it differs from other 
consumer associations), for which we attract funds from various 
sources. Right now we are conducting negotiations about this 
with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the 
Commission on the European Communities, and several other 
organizations. 
  Since our fund is charitable, our sponsors and investors are 
accorded the benefits envisioned by legislation if they invest 
their funds in charitable projects, which is what the programs 
carried out by the fund for certifying children's toys and 
children's food are, as are the separate funds for protection 
and safety (there are more than a thousand types, and their 
production employs about 800 enterprises in the country). 
Whereas the certification of items of automotive and tractor 
machine-building is not considered a charitable act. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] What part of the spectrum of consumer rights 
covers the activities of your fund? Do you defend the rights of 
enterprises as consumers of various output? 
  [Kalinin] We protect the rights of consumers--physical 
persons. As defined by the corresponding law. The rights of 
consumers--juridical persons--are safeguarded by state organs, 
as well as courts of arbitration. The spectrum of their rights 
is extremely broad, from political to economic. The sphere of 
our interests comprises primarily the economic rights of the 
individual as a consumer of goods and services. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Despite the diversity of violations of the 
rights of our country's consumers, the main cause is the 
monopolization of markets, which engenders the decreeing of 
prices and the low quality of goods and services. What measures 
should be undertaken to minimize the negative consequences of 
the economy's monopolization? 
  [Kalinin] Price decrees were engendered by the poorly 
thought 
out state policy of price liberalization. This policy must 
undergo cardinal change. As for the quality of output, given the 
monopoly nature of production, it must be constantly monitored 
from the outside. It has worked out that the quality of output, 
its certification, and the reliability of the funds for 
measurement are controlled basically by a single department, the 
RF Gosstandart. True, one other organization is involved in 
matters concerning expert analysis of consumer goods, the 
all-Russian association Soyuzekspertiza, under the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry. This is obviously insufficient. Life 
demands the creation of an extensive system of consumer expert 
analysis and certification, including nonstate, in order to 
eliminate the monopolism that exists in this sphere. Today 
foodstuffs and the raw materials used in their production are 
the most dangerous items on the consumer market. If foods are at 
least somewhat monitored for safety for the individual, then the 
initial raw materials remain outside the attention of the organs 
of certification and oversight. It is important to obtain 
certification and oversight for the technologies of production 
of all foods, beginning with the places of cultivation and the 
receipt of the initial components. A poisoned field cannot yield 
a good product. Therefore, we must achieve the introduction of 
complex systems of certification and oversight. Not only for 
foods but for all consumer goods and services within the 
framework of a system of state and independent consumer expert 
analysis. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] The solution to this problem is connected with 
the need to conduct a state policy of ensuring a uniformity of 
certification and oversight, similar to the old policy of 
ensuring the uniformity of measurements. Uniformity of 
certification and oversight allows us to obtain identical and 
reproducible results anywhere in the country. However, this 
requires us to solve several problems of a methodological, 
measurement, organizational, legislative, and technical nature. 
In particular, it is essential to obtain uniformity of 
standardization of measurement profiles and an evaluation of the 
accuracy of the means of oversight. As it is done for the means 
of measurement. For instance, scales and weights are the same 
throughout the world. This allows us to weigh a kilo of potatoes 
identically in Moscow and Nyu-Vasyuki. 
  [Kalinin] We have already run into these problems. Questions 
arise, for example, about how to certify banking services. 
Therefore we support the idea of creating both a common 
methodological center for certification and technical expert 
analysis and also specialized methodological centers, in 
particular, a center for the monitoring and certification of the 
radiation safety of consumer output. Several specialized centers 
mentioned above have already been created with our support. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Isn't it obviously just as important to 
monitor 
safety in the operation of machines and mechanisms utilized in 
rendering various services? Especially the means of transport, 
for which it makes sense to have built in a permanently 
functioning system of oversight, and possibly certification as 
well, with sensors at all danger points. Such systems make it 
possible to avert catastrophes at the early stages of their 
conception, when deviations of parameters from norms arise only 
at discrete points and their number does not exceed a certain 
level of danger. Apart from safety, this makes it possible to 
increase significantly the intervals between capital repairs of 
technical means and, consequently, the resource of their work 
will grow, which will also create a significant economic effect. 
  [Kalinin] The creation at one site or another of permanent 
systems of oversight and certification also must become the 
concern of the corresponding independent methodological centers. 
These are new commercial structures in which the fund is 
actively investing its funds. 
  Right now we are working on the draft for a national 
joint-stock insurance company, Kachestvo. We are talking about 
insuring risks connected with the quality of goods and services. 
On the basis of preliminary assessments of their quality, the 
company will insure primarily trade enterprises against possible 
losses due to poor-quality goods acquired for sale. This kind of 
prophylactic insurance will make it possible to move our own 
country's high-quality output into the market actively and with 
guarantees, which undoubtedly will be in the interests of 
consumers. At the same time such insurance will make it possible 
to decrease the price decrees of monopolists. This insurance is 
going to be implemented in our country for the first time. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Here you are going to run into the 
above-mentioned problem of assessing accuracy, that is, 
guaranteeing the insurance risk for the company and, connected 
with this, the margin of error in quality oversight, and 
therefore the accuracy of the testing of output. That is, its 
certification. 
  [Kalinin] In order to supply information for the work of the 
fund and the centers being created, we are planning to organize 
an electronic data bank, which will include all certified 
output. This means it can become a part of the international 
system, which will allow us, in conjunction with foreign 
consumer rights protection funds, to disclose unconscientious 
suppliers and importers and exports of poor-quality items not 
only in Russia but in other countries as well. 
  The ordinary consumer needs a supply of information, too, so 
we are planning to publish a series of brochures, hold a TV 
marathon, and organize several newspaper hotlines in which our 
experts and associates of the Certification VNII will 
participate. I hope that DELOVOY MIR will not refuse our offer 
to be a part of these efforts. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] With the release of prices and the beginning 
of 
the devastating devaluation of money, the state has for all 
intents and purposes confiscated savings kept in the Sberbank 
belonging to tens of millions of people. In doing so they 
violated, mildly speaking, the rights of depositors who utilized 
Sberbank's services. How does the fund intend to protect this 
category of consumers? 
  [Kalinin] In a decent society, debts (and confiscated 
savings 
are a state debt) are repaid. Therefore we support all proposals 
for the speedy compensation to depositors for losses and the 
prevention henceforth of any similar disrespectful--boorish 
even--treatment of consumers. People encountered the Sberbank's 
loutishness in July of last year, too, during the exchange of 
old banknotes for new, when they were forced to be crushed in 
lines. 
  Generally speaking, in the sphere of consumer services, not 
only is the dignity of citizens being trampled on as before, but 
their material interests are suffering as well. Prices for 
services have risen thousands of times. The sphere of consumer 
services is contracting since many can no longer afford 
services. Moreover, the quality of those services, due to the 
increased monopolism, is declining. Recently we conducted a 
check of several dozen Moscow photo studios. Long since 
privatized, naturally. In several of them control photographs 
were made from our sample negatives, and the pictures differed 
substantially from the originals. Moreover, the studios lacked 
proper calculation, and prices were set arbitrarily. This is not 
even talking about how rude some photographers were. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] How can you protect consumers from price 
tyranny in our pseudo-market environment? 
  [Kalinin] We can't, for all practical purposes. However, we 
are determined to undertake several steps. After all, given 
monopolism, many prices are born from the desire to rip as much 
as possible out of the consumer's pocket for personal 
consumption. Therefore these people have to be regulated and 
restricted somehow. Today the state is allowing anarchy in price 
formation. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] I think that the uncontrolled growth of prices 
under monopolism is born out of a desire for uncompensated 
borrowing at the expense of the consumer. After all, bank loans 
today entail 220 percent annual interest. The monopolist has 
raised prices in order to replenish his own circulating funds 
without burdening himself with debts, so he has obtained the 
necessary loan. Free of charge and forever. I think that the 
Metropolitan and telephone communications are expanding today by 
extorting money in this manner. The simplest calculation shows 
that if the Moscow Metro is used daily by 10 million passengers, 
daily receipts come to 500 million rubles. Given this kind of 
income, is the systematic increase in the cost of travel 
justified? 
  [Kalinin] I have attempted to familiarize myself with the 
expenses and bookkeeping balance sheets of the Metropolitan. I 
did not succeed, however. Everything is cloaked in secret. After 
all, though, the Metropolitan is a a state enterprise. What then 
is there to say about private, especially trade enterprises? 
There the buyer is deceived as before: they misweigh and 
miscount. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] But what if all buyers are transformed into 
non-staff monitors? With payment to them of a specific portion 
of the fine exacted from the violator if the violation has been 
revealed by the buyer. Moreover, the fine must be quite 
substantial. 
  [Kalinin] That suggestion is worth considering.

<F P=106> [Statement by Russian Federation Metallurgy Committee </F>
Chairman Serafim Afonin: "We Are Not Taking a Kopeck from the 
Budget"] 
  [Text] At the end of January the Russian government 
basically approved the draft Federal Program for Technical 
Retooling and Development of Russia's Metallurgy up to the Year 
2000. The ink on the document was barely dry, as they say, when 
one of the newspapers already called the program inflationary. 
However, I am sure that the journalist did not even take the 
trouble to glance at it. 
  How can the program be called inflationary when we are not 
taking a kopeck from the state budget for its realization? Out 
of the general sum of 40.810 billion rubles [R] needed for 
retooling the sector the enterprises' own funds comprise R28.168 
billion, or 69 percent, and other funds that have been attracted 
comprise R8.526 billion (20.9 percent). Only R4.116 billion, 
hardly more than 10 percent, is from state investment credits. 
Credit, I emphasize, which needs to be returned and not grants 
or subsidies. 
  Of course we will need state support in order to fulfill the 
program. It is necessary to review duty rates for stimulating 
the export of metallurgical products with a high technical 
preparedness and restraining analagous imports. Certain other 
tariff and tax relief is required, let's say for importing 
equipment which is not produced in Russia, and for a number of 
other instances. But this is normal state protectionism which is 
practiced everywhere for supporting basic sectors of a country's 
economy. And metallurgy, along with the fuel and energy 
complex, determines the viabiliy of Russia's economic organism 
as a whole. 
  Fulfilling the complete volume of work for technical 
retooling of metallurgy goes beyond this century. However, the 
realization of basic measures intended before the year 2000 will 
allow significant improvement in the structure of metallurgical 
production. Introducing progressive technology will decrease 
the expenditure of steel for rolled metal, of coke, energy 
resources and pig iron for steel smelting. This will also 
significantly improve the ecological situation in the 
metallurgical regions.

<F P=106> [Report by Radmir Kilmatov: "The Government Has Approved an </F>
Inflation Program"] 
  [Text] The federal program for technical reequipment 
and development of Russia's metallurgy in the 1993-2000 period, 
which KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported yesterday, has been approved by 
a decree of the chairman of the Council of Ministers. Actually 
the first combined program for an entire sector which was not 
declared a priority in the government's economic policy (unlike 
the military, agrarian, and fuel complexes) has been 
approved. 
  An assessment of the quality indicators of the sector 
conducted by specialists on the Committee for Metallurgy 
demonstrated that only 10 to 15 percent of the total volume of 
finished metal products can compete successfully in the world 
market at present. The output is not competitive because of its 
high energy and resource consumption. The crisis in metallurgy 
is having an effect on subcontracting sectors, and large-scale 
renovation of the metallurgical industry means the solution of 
many problems in the national economy as a whole. 
  The introduction of new economizing technologies in Russia's 
largest enterprises has been assessed at $15 billion. Developers 
of the program initially proposed that the main financing come 
from the enterprises' own funds, providing only 10 percent from 
preferential investment loans. However, as a result of freeing 
the prices for energy resources, such investments in production 
reequipment for Russia's metallurgical enterprises in their 
current financial condition is "an impermissible luxury." So 
most likely the government, after adopting the program, will be 
resolving the problem of financing it through the budget; for 
this it will have to reduce the number of measures (especially 
as under the government decree, funds will be allocated 
separately for each of the 50 facilities included in the program 
"based on the specific conditions and effectiveness of the 
measures being implemented"). 
  Another method of resolving the financial problems may be to 
expand the representation of outside investors (at present, 15 
percent of the program volume), for which it is essential to put 
an end to the problem of the sector's indebtedness first of all. 
The most logical step from the standpoint of the sector's 
managers might be mutual part payment of the debts, accompanied 
by a "limited" credit emission. Prospects for inflationary 
financing of the program from the budget are determined by 
possible changes in the cabinet's policy and by the fact that 
development of the metallurgical industry is an area "of 
professional interest" to Oleg Soskovets, the first vice premier 
and former chairman of Roskommetallurgii [Russian Federation 
Committee on Metallurgy]. 
<H6>  Basic Objectives of the Federal Program </H6>

  -  Participation 
by enterprises in interstate associations within the framework 
of the Eurasian Coal and Metal Association 
  -  Introduction of 
resource conservation technologies 
  -  Reduction of harmful effects 
on the environment 
  -  Minimization of transportation 
expenditures 

<H5>    Measures of State Support: </H5>

  -  Release of enterprises 
implementing the program measures from payment of customs duties 
when selling metal products and purchasing equipment 
  -  Relief from 
taxation of profit which enterprises direct at investment 
programs

mineralogical sciences: "The Secret of the Kodar Sobakita"] 
  [Text] The secrecy classification has been removed 
from information about the search for and extraction of uranium. 
Anyone who has worked for decades in this mysterious field 
feels, together with relief and a feeling of bitterness, that 
too many years have been spent in a routine of prohibitions and 
inflexible restrictions. 
  I will not undertake to judge the advisability of the 
decisions made a half century ago--the all-embracing 
classification of that vast body of human and physical resources 
which was put into effect at the dawn of the atomic problem. I 
know only that not one of the countries outside the socialist 
camp has taken such a step. We must think that we are not the 
last ones for purely economic reasons, in order to avoid the 
huge unproductive expenditures, to maintain an army of 
protectors and the inevitable informers in secret matters. All 
the same, the leak of information is already substantial when 
there are two who bring it instead of one, unless they are truly 
isolated from the outside world, of course. But hundreds of 
thousands, if not millions of people, have been counted here. 
  In 1954, when a program of searches for uranium was 
undertaken on a wide scale, a geological technician with a 
radiation meter joined our coal geological exploration party in 
Ryazan Oblast. And in the core sample of one of the boreholes 
selected for measurement, in a plain layer of clay on the side 
of the coal-bearing area, a high concentration of uranium was 
suddenly discovered. Soon after, controlled drilling was begun 
under conditions of strict secrecy. The trust employees stood 
watch at the drills and collected and documented the cores, and 
we just provided the drilling process. To the puzzled questions 
why we were drilling where there is obviously no coal and in a 
system that was unprecedentedly dense, the response was for the 
needs of the trust, "but I do not know what kind." While the 
slyly smiling drilling foreman once revealed that his mother had 
brought home a tale from the market that geologists had found an 
"atom" under the village of Zheltukhino. 
  How can we help but remember the immortal adage, over 
200 years old, uttered by the observant Madam de (Stal) after a 
trip to our country: "In Russia everything is a mystery and 
nothing is a secret." The instructional song of the miner 
leaving for a health resort could also have been included in the 
Vysotskiy repertoire by the head of the first division of the 
uranium mine. Quiet Yakov Davidovich Gotman, an honored figure 
in science and technology, one of the pioneers of Soviet uranium 
geology and discoverer of the unique Aldan uranium mining area 
in southern Yakutia, has recounted the absolutely fantastic 
story about the information leak. In the late 1940's, he was 
sent along with S. Yershov, the deputy minister of geology, and 
his colleague B. Petrushevskiy, to Central Asia on assignment. 
On the next day, the "Voice of America" reported the departure 
of three specialists from Moscow for the Central Asian uranium 
deposits. 
  After the country acquired its atomic and thermonuclear 
weapons, through the selfless labor of its specialists and with 
a little help from the prospectors who were just as selfless, 
and was able to stockpile enough of them to annihilate all life 
on the planet, secrecy in the geology of atomic raw material was 
turned into an indisputable absurdity. But the screws were 
tightened even more. 
  In the first decades of the uranium boom a researcher 
working 
in the atomic energy field could publish scientific works which 
did not deal with uranium with all the publication data, 
including the name of the organization in which he was working. 
But if reference was made to articles on uranium geology, 
mention of the subject of one's research and its geographical 
location, as well as one's place of work, was prohibited. The 
routine of a scientific institution was also considered a big 
state secret, and Anatoliy Shcheranskiy, as we know, paid with a 
13-year sentence in the camps at the end of the Brezhnev era for 
allegedly divulging such information. 
  From the mid-1970's, after achieving parity with the United 
States, the ban on indicating one's place of work was extended 
to all scientists who were working with uranium. Even if the 
author of a completely harmless article did not mention uranium 
in previously published works. Even when secrets which they 
endeavored to safeguard were lost because of circumstances, this 
did not stop those in control of universal secrecy. After the 
Prague spring was smothered, the head of uranium geology in 
Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Ruzhechka, did not return home. In a 
book published in Canada in the mid-1970's, he revealed the 
uranium resources not only of Eastern Europe, but the Soviet 
Union as well. But like a mosquito which continues sucking blood 
by inertia when its belly has been cut off, so the illuminated 
skyscraper of domestic secrecy has continued to increase the 
number of its stories. 
  The closed nature of the sector was convenient for the 
uranium barons to a large extent, making it easier to pump huge 
budget appropriations into it. The overexploration of deposits, 
linked chiefly with the faulty planning system, which is 
inconceivable in other countries, is typical for Soviet geology 
as a classic cost-based branch of the economy of socialism. 
Wages and bonuses depended not on specific results, but the 
running meters of drilling, the cubic meters penetrated, and so 
forth. Thus the effectiveness of geological exploration 
operations turned out to be less advantageous for collectives 
than increasing their volumes. 
  It is unlikely that the almost unknown venture involving the 
mobilization of vast sums and numbers of people in completely 
unprepared searches for uranium in the Kodar Range in 
northeastern Chita Oblast would have been possible without 
absolute secrecy. Based only on a highly radioactive piece of 
rock with absolutely no geographical connection (such specimens 
are called "sobakity" in geological terminology) which was sent 
to Moscow, they quickly sent out two camps of prisoners into the 
unpopulated high mountains under severe conditions in the late 
1940's, and urgently put together a specialized geological 
exploration expedition and a second expedition to conduct 
scientific support for the operations, organized from scientific 
associates of the Leningrad Geological Institute, who were to 
remain at the site the year round. At the same time, they 
shipped out heavy equipment and began drilling, tunneling, and 
so forth in an area that had been given absolutely no geological 
study. In the wilderness of the mountainous taiga, out of touch 
with communications, the prisoners immediately began erecting 
the buildings of a new town. The materials needed were taken in 
by a winter road, and by aircraft the remainder of the year. The 
results turned out to be poor--at the cost of much effort and 
many lives, they found only a number of small signs of ore, 
unsuitable for industrial exploitation. 
  The army of specialists who provided their intellect and 
hard 
labor and often lost their health to develop the country's 
uranium base were the victims of this secrecy. They were 
prohibited from traveling abroad, even to "fraternal countries," 
and from contacts and correspondence with foreign colleagues, 
which scientists need like a person needs air. Without 
convincing explanations, authorization to participate in 
international conferences could be refused, even when they took 
place in the USSR, and even when personally invited with a paper 
which did not lead to complaints. 
  When my article on important aspects of the theory of ore 
formation, whose conclusions were based on Ilya Prigozhin's 
assumptions about the lack of equilibrium in thermodynamics, 
appeared in one of the scientific journals, I decided to send a 
reprint to the Nobel laureate and soon after received a warm 
letter from him, a copy of his last monograph, and an invitation 
to visit him at the institute in Brussels. 
  Dreams about a trip were obviously illusory at that time. 
But 
it would really be up-to-date for an outstanding scientist of 
modern times to publish support for his scientific ideas. It was 
during those very years of exhausting opposition from the 
powerful (not in number, but opportunities) group of scientific 
opponents headed by V. A. Zharikov, the current 
academician-secretary of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], 
who was no less omnipotent then as the chairman of the VAK 
[Higher Degree Commission] and who successfully blocked my 
certification for the doctor of sciences degree for almost 20 
years. 
  Nevertheless, I preferred to remain silent, for the fact 
that 
I had exchanged letters with a foreign scientist could have been 
harmful. 
  The restrictions on movement and contacts were imposed on 
participants in the American atomic project as well. But unlike 
our bureaucracy, these restrictions were extended equally to 
everyone, from Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the project, to 
the ordinary technician. But our uranium "generals," who 
possessed incomparably greater information under the "secret" 
classification, very calmly traveled throughout the world. The 
wives of the high officials working in the uranium field also 
had the same privileges. 
  The Americans were generously compensated with additional 
payments for the inconveniences related to the restrictions. 
Additional payment "for secrecy" was also stipulated for Soviet 
uranium employees by some ancient classified government decrees. 
But in accordance with the classicial laws of the Kingdom of 
Distorting Mirrors, the payments were received by the directors, 
their deputies, chief accountants, and employees of the first 
divisions, that is, the ones who forgot long ago how to hold a 
geologist's hammer--or never did know how, or how to walk the 
hills and dales with a radiation meter and through mine 
workings, or to study the radioactive rocks under a microscope. 
  The farfetched secrecy, in accordance with the laws of 
feedback, has hit the system which gave rise to it as well. 
There is a wide conviction that the criminals sentenced to death 
are not shot but sent to the uranium mines, where they soon die. 
This is all a fantasy. Throughout my working life I have spent 
innumerable shifts underground not only in uranium mines, but 
coal, cobalt, molybdenum, and gold workings as well. I am 
prepared to attest to the fact that I never encountered more 
comfortable conditions than in uranium mines. A well organized 
and strictly controlled ventilation system that provides for 
work safety, workings at one's full height, not manholes for 
"abdominal movement," and a large number of showers on the 
surface, maintained in model sanitary condition... 
  Of course, the all-powerful Minsredmash [Ministry of Medium 
Machine Building] was not ashamed to make use of the convicts' 
forced labor on a wide scale. But just in construction and 
auxiliary operations. The prisoners were not underground. They 
were not needed there, and the uranium mines did not experience 
a shortage of a mining work force. Many were attracted there by 
the exemplary work conditions, the higher earnings, and the 
well-equipped housing with which the ministry's towns and 
settlements were always provided. In addition, the radioactivity 
of even the rich natural ores is incomparable with the enriched 
uranium from the reactors of nuclear power stations, the deadly 
radiation which is erroneously attributed to the mines. If one 
is looking for places suitable for prisoners condemned to death, 
one should look in the coal mines, with their unacceptably low 
level of safety equipment. 
  But what comes with the declassification of uranium, aside 
from a belated quiet satisfaction? Its features as a more 
"cosmopolitan" environment than other ores help to "get into" 
the general natural laws of ore formation. So the tens of 
thousands of volumes of handwritten reports by Soviet uranium 
workers with the most extensive information, which continue to 
remain behind the steel doors of the geological funds, are truly 
the property of world science. The titanic intellectual labor of 
several generations of specialists, which is capable of standing 
up to the competition in any market of scientific knowledge, is 
concentrated in them. The only question is whether we are really 
able to enter these steel doors.

Kozlovskiy under the rubric "Crime Report": "A Selection of 
Poison. Is the Decision of the Former Parliament To Abolish 
Criminal Liability for Drug Use Legitimate?"] 
  [Text] Moscow Oblast--The key went into the lock, the 
lock clicked, and I found myself in a ward of a psychiatric 
hospital. Yet another key, another dry and quiet click, and the 
door closed securely behind me. If I wanted to understand even a 
little of what went on behind this closed door for two months, I 
had to stay calm and be patient for at least one day. 
  Here was a 17-year-old guy from a vocational technical 
school 
who was a roommate of mine. A 30-year-old physician, a 
cardiologist--a former physician, of course--was on another bed, 
next to a barred window. A third patient lay on a made-up bed 
next to the door. He had a most unique tattoo on his completely 
bared chest from which it would be immediately clear to a 
slammer specialist what this man has done time for and for how 
long. 
  All of these people were drug addicts with a history. I was 
"planted" there by the editorial office to write about how they 
had ended up there and how they feel in the "loony bin." 
  Why did the newspaper need this particular crime report? The 
words "drug business" are used with increasing frequency in 
presentations by lawyers and employees of the prosecutor's 
offices and the militia. Some 1.5 million Russians use narcotics 
permanently. Specialists project that this number will double in 
five to six years. The prospects are dismal, especially if we 
take into account the fact that in the last 10 years 
narcotics-related crime has increased by a factor of three. 
  So far, our situation has been different from that in the 
region of the so-called "golden triangle" (Burma, Laos, 
Vietnam). The domestic drug business is not yet on a par with 
the Medellin cartel from South America. However, there is enough 
reason to worry because on issues of crime we frequently also 
find ourselves "ahead of the entire planet." 
  What influenced my roommates in deciding "to get hooked," 
join the "sniffers," or pop "pills" and do "grass?" The 
30-year-old cardiologist injected himself with promedol while 
still a student. Why? His colleague from the institute had 
promised unheard-of bliss. Then he injected himself another 
time, and rolled downhill. He could no longer do without two 
injections a day. Meanwhile, life went on. He graduated from the 
institute and got married. However, on learning that her husband 
was a drug addict, his wife took their 1-year-old daughter along 
and left. His father got sick.... 
  The guy from the vocational technical school painted a 
generally familiar picture. Up to 20 boys got together, poured a 
solvent into plastic bags and, putting in their heads, inhaled 
for several hours until they were spaced out. None of the 
passers-by who are scared of our present-day life and who saw 
them sitting on stairways or in the hallways of homes got 
outraged, tried to stop them, or reported them to the militia. 
  The befuddled youths who inhaled poison engaged in wild 
carnage right there, in front of the houses. Their confused 
minds did not understand that they were beating to death their 
own best friend.... 
  The third one, with tattoos, looked askance at the newcomer. 
He just did not want to acknowledge me as a drug addict who was 
brought in for compulsory treatment. Likewise, I was not 
particularly eager to converse, having learned from the 
physicians the biographic details about this man who had 
repeatedly partaken of the "coziness" of prison bunk beds. After 
committing a serious crime, he was saved from the "highest 
measure" by just one factor--the state of narcotic intoxication 
in which he committed robbery and murder. 
  Finally, he started talking too. I figured out only one 
thing 
from the unintelligible stream of verbiage: he does not intend 
to get off drugs. He will fake having "kicked the habit," get 
out of hospital captivity, and shoot up right away. 
  I looked at him and thought that it would be nice to put, in 
this or another room of the psychiatric hospital, the deputies 
of the former parliament who adopted the decision to cancel 
criminal liability for drug use. I recalled a conversation with 
N. Osipov, the deputy chief of the administration for illegal 
drug trafficking of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  Nikolay Nikolayevich was indignant: "We consulted even the 
relevant services of the United Nations on this issue. Nobody 
told us that punishing a person for using drugs amounts to an 
encroachment on his personal freedom or an infringement of human 
rights. Yet for some reason they have been persistently trying 
to deprive us of a very serious device for the prevention of 
drug addiction." 
  Meanwhile, an atmosphere of confidence prevailed in the cell 
room. As one of their own, I was already being told about a boy 
who is prepared to commit contract murder for a glass of hashish 
or marijuana. They whispered about a group of drug addicts who 
raped an 8-year-old girl. They discussed news coming in from the 
outside about the apprehension of either drug pushers or 
procurers from whom more than a quintal of "grass" was 
confiscated. 
  As I listened to these revelations, I once again recalled 
our 
conversation at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia. 
  "If it goes on like this and they turn a blind eye to the 
reality of the drug business, I will not be surprised if they 
officially begin to offer an extensive selection of drugs for 
dessert in restaurants and cafes." Of course, Colonel N. Osipov 
was exaggerating. However, in Saratov, for example, they easily 
showed me places where poison for the soul and the body could be 
purchased without a problem. 
  Personally, I know something else, too. If you want to buy 
more "supplies," you make tracks for Saransk. If you need 
cheaper merchandise, you slip through to Almaty. 
  One in five uncovered groups dealing in drugs had 
excellently 
established interregional connections. Some groups numbered up 
to 50 members. It is only our inviolable Union that has fallen 
apart. The criminal commonwealth has only grown stronger. Here, 
"international obligations" are met precisely and on time. Some 
supply raw materials, others process them, still others sell 
them or find room to store them. 
  N. Osipov believes that "for now, we are being saved by two 
circumstances. Domestic drug addicts have not been spoiled, they 
use the simplest types of drugs, and frequently surrogates. 
  "The second aspect is like this. Major operators have not 
yet 
been drawn into the Russian drug trade. For now, 30-40 percent 
of drug addicts procure the poison themselves. As it were, wild 
hemp occupies more than 1 million hectares." 
  I asked Osipov: "So, it turns out that it is not too late 
yet? And there is no reason for them to intimidate the common 
citizens with the gloomy figure of a narcotics trafficker?" 
  Osipov said: "No. As the saying goes, the process has gotten 
underway here, too...." 
  Had my roommates known what kind of information I had, their 
jaws would perhaps have dropped as they listened. After all, I 
was aware of quite specific cases, rather than criminal 
gossip--the case of a dangerous repeat offender setting up an 
underground laboratory for drug production, for example. 
  The operation in St. Petersburg was even more successful. A 
highly skilled company got together there which was headed by a 
research associate of an institute on the banks of the Neva. 
They manufactured a synthetic drug of such potency that it is 
now being talked about not only on the banks of the Neva. 
  However, there was no reason for me to share this knowledge, 
nor was there any time. A nurse came and let me out.

<F P=106> [AzerTadzh report: "We Must All Serve a Single Goal--Defense </F>
of the Unity, Integrity, and Sovereignty of Azerbaijan. Meeting 
With the Leaders of Political Parties and Grassroots Movements"] 
  [Text] On 17 November Geydar Aliyev, president of the 
Azerbaijan Republic, held a meeting with the leaders of 
political parties and grassroots movements at which were 
discussed the war situation, the sources of the emergence of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh problem, and ways of settling the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet, State Secretary Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva, other 
officials, and the leaders of all political parties and 
grassroots movements, except for the People's Front of 
Azerbaijan, and also representatives of the news media, took 
part in the meeting. 
  The meeting was opened by Geydar Aliyev. He said, in part: 
  Discharging the functions of chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
of Azerbaijan and subsequently assuming the office of president 
of the republic, I expressed my opinion concerning the social 
and political and economic life of Azerbaijan. This you know. I 
would like once more briefly to mention that the continued 
existence of the Azerbaijan Republic is connected exclusively 
with state independence. Azerbaijan must build its state on the 
basis of democratic principles. This means that a state based on 
the rule of law should be built and a democratic society created 
in the republic. We must take advantage of the achievements of 
world democracy and the traditions of the first independent 
state of Azerbaijan created in 1918. Freedom of the individual, 
freedom of speech and worship, defense of human rights, the 
equality of all citizens, and political pluralism should be 
established in Azerbaijan as the basic attributes of a 
democratic society. 
  As president, I will organize my activity on the basis of 
these principles, G. Aliyev went on to observe. I have summoned 
and once again summon the political parties and grassroots 
movements of the republic to joint action and cooperation based 
on these principles. 
  Speaking of the social and political and military situation 
in the country, the president declared that, possibly, these 
principles were not entirely applicable to the present position 
of Azerbaijan, which has for approximately six years been living 
under the conditions of war. Part of our land, the head of state 
recalled, has been captured by the Armenian armed forces. There 
are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. The republic's 
economy is in a profound crisis. All this is forcing the 
republic to live in accordance with the laws of wartime. But, 
the president observed, I believe that all social and political 
forces of the country and all citizens of Azerbaijan, regardless 
of their beliefs, should today be serving a single goal--that of 
defense of the unity, integrity, and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. 
It will then be possible both to organize defenses and to 
extricate the republic from this grim situation. I believe, he 
emphasized, that we still have the opportunity for this. 
Following the path of democracy, political pluralism, and the 
market economy and creating extensive opportunities for the 
development of enterprise, we can, having united all forces, 
secure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the republic. 
  Having dwelt on the role of the political parties in the 
accomplishment of national and state tasks, Geydar Aliyev 
observed that the constructive position of all social and 
political organizations is an essential condition of 
cooperation. We must on this condition either continue our 
activity on the basis of democratic principles or adopt the 
frequently advanced proposal concerning the declaration of 
martial law to save Azerbaijan and extricate the country from 
the crisis. 
  Speaking of the reasons that had prompted the leadership to 
organize this meeting, the head of Azerbaijan emphasized that in 
building the strategy of his activity on democratic principles, 
he would give preference to cooperation with all political 
parties and public organizations operating in the republic. In 
order that this meeting might be held on a democratic basis, he 
announced, the representatives of all political parties and 
public organizations were notified two days earlier on 
television and invited to this meeting. We wanted, G. Aliyev 
said, each social and political organization to send its 
representatives to it itself. We wanted to meet and exchange 
opinions with the representatives of all parties and movements, 
regardless of their size and degree of influence on the social 
and political life of the republic. 
  Geydar Aliyev expressed gratitude to the representatives of 
all political parties and grassroots movements for their 
participation in the meeting. In his opinion, the refusal of 
representatives of the People's Front of Azerbaijan to take part 
should be seen as the absence in this organization, which has in 
recent years performed a definite and important part in the 
political life of Azerbaijan, of a desire for constructive 
cooperation. 
  Having touched on the questions to be submitted for 
discussion by the participants in the meeting, the president 
observed that its main purpose was consultation and an exchange 
of opinions on a number of problems. There are many subjects for 
discussion, but I believe, Geydar Aliyev said, that you will 
agree that the main and at the same time most difficult task for 
our republic, our people, and the state today is an end to the 
war. We have been trying to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh 
problem, which was imposed on Azerbaijan, for approximately six 
years now. It seems to me that this is the most urgent, most 
important question. If we can find ways out of the war, get back 
the captured territories, and resolve the Karabakh problem, the 
president observed, a solution of the other problems will be 
possible. 
  Only by having resolved this problem can we achieve a 
significant improvement in the sphere of constitutional 
development, the economy, and social policy, overcome the 
crisis, and erect a barrier to crime. I call on you, therefore, 
for an exchange of opinions primarily on these matters. 
  In the past six years, Geydar Aliyev went on to say, social 
and political organizations and parties and state authorities 
and also organs of the press have expressed various opinions, 
considerations, and proposals and implemented certain measures. 
But none has thus far produced the desired result. Whereas six 
years ago the Nagorno-Karabakh question was perceived only as a 
problem, an incident, subsequently, growing by the day, by the 
month, by the year, this problem became a casus belli between 
the two states, between the two republics. There have been tough 
military operations as of late. The fruitlessness of the 
measures adopted by Azerbaijan is shown also by the fact that 
control over the entire territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh 
Oblast has been lost in the recent period, and even our areas 
bordering the oblast have gradually been occupied by Armenian 
armed forces. 
  The parties, public organizations, and organs of the press 
are at this difficult time of our life once again presenting 
various proposals and thoughts. Some people believe that this 
question could be settled quickly and that Azerbaijan would be 
spared this tragedy were their proposals adopted and the path 
that they propose chosen. 
  I believe that the representatives of the political parties 
and grassroots movements should advance their proposals today, 
the head of state said. If the adopted measures are not 
producing the desired result, Azerbaijan is suffering one defeat 
after another, and some people believe that they are capable of 
averting such a course of events, then let us confer. Each 
thought, each proposal is valuable. If these proposals help 
extricate Azerbaijan from the present difficult situation, these 
proposals should, regardless of who made them, be adopted, and 
we should join forces. 
  In my appeal to the people on 2 November, I called on all 
citizens of Azerbaijan to rise up and join their efforts at this 
difficult time for the republic, the president observed. I 
called on all political parties and grassroots movements for 
solidarity and service of the cause of defense of the 
territorial integrity of the Azerbaijan Republic and a return of 
the occupied land. Such is my opinion, and it is sincere. I 
repeat: Everyone and all parties and organizations holding 
different, even, possibly, diametrically opposite positions, 
should unite for the sake of this goal. Everyone here has one 
motherland--Azerbaijan--and we all live on the same 
soil--Azerbaijani. Each piece of this earth is sacred for each 
of us. If this rivalry and squabbling and this struggle for 
power, wherein use is made of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, 
continues, if all this becomes the cause of a weakening of our 
defense capability and a further expansion of the aggression of 
the Armenian armed forces, if Azerbaijan falls apart and 
perishes, where will those who are struggling for power form 
their governments? I repeat: We have one motherland, and all 
should act in its name. 
  I would like you today to have a candid, fruitful 
conversation and for your thoughts not to be dissipated on other 
topics, the president said. If we arrive at a specific opinion 
on the matter under discussion, if we can truly unite all 
forces, we will continue such meetings and hold discussions on 
other matters also. But this will depend on today's discussion. 
I hope that I have managed to clearly convey my thoughts to 
those present. And now I am prepared to listen closely to your 
opinions and proposals. 
  The floor was given over to the participants in the meeting. 
In the course of the meeting, which lasted more than five hours, 
the leaders of more than 20 parties and grassroots movements, 
who had their say on the current strained atmosphere in the 
republic and on ways of stabilizing the situation in Azerbaijan, 
spoke. Some of the speakers condemned the People's Front of 
Azerbaijan for the fact that its representatives had declined 
this meeting. 
  A large part of the speakers evaluated this meeting as an 
important step en route to political dialogue in the business of 
regulating the social and political and military situation in 
the republic. The activity that had been exercised as of late, 
geared to the removal of the chaos and lawlessness which had 
taken shape in the period of the leadership of the former 
authorities, was approved. The need for the adoption of laws in 
the military, political, and economic spheres, for a display of 
decisiveness on a number of issues, and for the adoption of 
tough measures was noted. 
  A proposal concerning the creation of a political 
consultative council and the preparation of the mechanism of its 
work was advanced at the meeting. But, in the opinion of a 
number of speakers, were this council to be formed under the 
auspices of parliament and its legal status to be defined, more 
effective results could be expected. A large part of those who 
spoke approved this proposal. It was observed that, having 
united the forces of all political parties and grassroots 
movements of the republic and having perfected and accelerated 
even more the organizational development of the army, it was 
essential to adopt comprehensive measures to prevent the seizure 
of our land. 
  Those who spoke observed that inefficient use was being made 
in the republic thus far of the material, scientific, and 
personnel potential, the preparation of the youth for military 
service had been organized unsatisfactorily, lawlessness was 
being perpetrated at times under the guise of mobilization, and 
the necessary conditions for speeches to the fighters in areas 
of the front of the artistic intelligentsia and veterans to 
raise the former's patriotic spirit were not being created. 
  The speakers said with concern that there is in the capital 
of the republic and in other large cities no sense that there is 
a war going on. They expressed regret in connection with the 
fact that an uncompromising struggle was not being conducted 
against mafia groups and criminal outfits, which are abusing the 
current situation. In the opinion of certain speakers, martial 
law should be declared, mobilization should be intensified, all 
production bays, enterprises, and administrations should 
organize their work in accordance with the requirements of 
wartime, and everything should be adapted to the interests of 
the front as quickly as possible. The participants in the 
meeting spoke in detail about the mistakes in the organization 
of the work of defense and noted the importance of sponsorship 
of each unit and increased state concern for the families of the 
fighters. A main military control inspectorate should begin to 
function to shore up discipline in the army. 
  Many speakers emphatically condemned the fact that material 
of an insulting nature, unsubstantiated and contentious, is 
appearing in a large quantity in many press organs and 
considered it necessary under the present conditions to suspend 
the activity of all political parties and grassroots movements 
and also to suspend the activity of a number of press organs. 
  Mention was made with satisfaction at the meeting of the 
activity of the present leadership of the republic aimed at a 
solution of military problems by political methods and of the 
need for a continuation of this work. It was observed that a 
cease-fire, if only for a short time, was necessary at this 
difficult time for the country. In the opinion of the 
participants in the meeting, it is necessary to find new 
diplomatic channels, to use all means that could contribute to 
the implementation of the resolutions passed by international 
organizations, and to work actively on conveying to the world 
public the truth about the predatory actions of the Armenian 
aggressors. 
  Those who spoke emphatically condemned the attempts to 
create 
antagonism between the authorities and the opposition and said 
that the present opposition was in fact conducting not so much a 
political struggle as a struggle for power, which was 
fundamentally contrary to the wishes of the Azerbaijani people. 
  Closing the meeting, Geydar Aliyev said, summing up the 
exchange of opinions: 
  Although this meeting was belated, it was useful, 
nonetheless. We have for five hours had a wide-ranging exchange 
of opinions, and the representatives of political parties, 
organizations, and movements have advanced a whole range of 
proposals and thoughts. They included, undoubtedly, thoughts 
that were useful, but also those that are far removed from the 
main subject of our meeting. But I approach with respect and 
attention each proposal and each thought, and I hope that all 
this will be useful in the future. 
  At the start of our meeting, I explained that the main 
conversation and main discussion should deal with one issue--the 
extrication of Azerbaijan from the state of war, the return of 
the occupied land, and a resolution of the Karabakh problem. 
Unfortunately, there have not been enough specific proposals in 
this connection. 
  You know that some newspapers operating from an accusatory 
position in this connection and their owners want to create in 
society the impression that they know the paths of a solution of 
these questions and that the people who are directing the state 
at this moment are pursuing the wrong policy and occupying the 
wrong position and do not know how to resolve the urgent 
problems. But today's meeting has shown that these words, 
rumors, and slanderous articles are not backed by a single 
specific suggestion or constructive thought. 
  I am convinced that in a republic subjected to military 
aggression, confrontation needs to be brought to an end. Enough. 
In these five or six years, confrontation in Azerbaijan has 
reached extremes. This has been of no benefit either to the 
people or the independent state of Azerbaijan. It is merely 
damage that has been caused from year to year. All these blows, 
having mounted up, have ultimately put the economy of the 
republic in a difficult position, and this has been reflected 
particularly in a weakening and limitation of the possibilities 
of averting military aggression. As a result, part of the 
republic has been snatched away. And unless an end is put to the 
confrontation, certain forces, taking advantage of the Karabakh 
problem, will continue the struggle for power. 
  If the people who were yesterday in power and who reduced 
the 
republic to such a condition, daily giving interviews in the 
newspapers, continue, as before, to publish provocative ideas, 
it will be impossible to preserve the republic, and it will fall 
apart. Those who were in office yesterday and who have now been 
removed and who were unable to resolve the urgent problems do 
not today have the moral right to criticize, debunk, and give 
interviews. They have quit the scene, and if they have 
understood their mistakes, they should now be doing everything 
really to help extricate the people from the present difficult 
situation. Or they should step aside and say: Yes, we were 
unable to handle this, let us see how it ends. But once again 
stepping up confrontation under the motto, as Gabil Guseynli 
said, "Either us or no one"--this should be seen merely as 
treachery in relation to the people, which can only destroy the 
republic. And this is complicating even more the already 
difficult situation of the country and causing its economic 
potential and military power great harm. 
  As many speakers observed, some persons, who are repeating 
over and over: "We have lost yet another village," "One more 
district has been captured," and rejoicing at this, are 
celebrating it. Instead of uniting the people, they are 
inflaming passions, which is increasing in society the trend 
toward disarticulation and is an even more telling blow than 
that which is being delivered by our enemy. 
  I want at our meeting first and foremost to bring to your 
attention the fact that, as a president who has assumed this 
immense responsibility, I know and sense how complex and 
difficult it is. I would like those who love their motherland, 
the land, and the people, and who are committed to an 
independent Azerbaijan Republic, to help me see this mission 
through to the end. If, on the other hand, assistance does not 
follow and some people remain in opposition and engage in 
complaining, I will undoubtedly have to put an end to this 
attitude. I concur with the opinion of Neymat Panakhly to the 
effect that division by the "power-opposition" principle is out 
of the question at this time. If the state has for five years 
been in a state of war and has for five years been losing land, 
how long will there continue to be talk about such a division in 
this state? 
  The "power-opposition" question is usually based on two 
principles. The first is ideological. The opposition forces, 
cleaving to different ideological views, disagree with the 
ideology of the authorities, dismiss them, and implement their 
own ideology. There is no ideological disconnection here at this 
time. We all advocate the independence of Azerbaijan and must 
defend this independence. There are no other opinions. Etibar 
Mamedov has said that Azerbaijan's membership in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States is weakening and limiting its 
independence. I disagree with this opinion. I have my own 
opinion in this connection, of course. And Etibar Mamedov knows 
that the issue is by no means as he frames it. But he expresses 
this opinion, since he has to be in opposition. Of the 15 
republics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that 
gained independence, 12 are members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. Only the Baltic states have not joined. But 
have the countries that have joined the CIS lost their 
independence? Have Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, or neighboring 
Turkmenistan, which from the economic viewpoint comes out the 
winner, as they say, lost their independence? 
  Someone said here that although Turkey a year ago allocated 
Azerbaijan a loan in the amount of $250 million, not $1 million 
of this sum has been utilized as yet. But Turkmenistan has 
utilized it. According to information available to us, many 
states are making big investments in this republic. But is this 
meeting with any objections? Although Turkmenistan is a member 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, there are a number of 
CIS documents that it has not signed. Why are we, joining the 
Commonwealth and not yet having had time to properly see what is 
what, saying that we have lost independence or are limiting it? 
  I would like to say once more that we all support 
Azerbaijan's independence and that I personally have observed 
repeatedly that I will defend Azerbaijan's state independence, 
regardless of where I am, with all my activity, until the last 
minute of my life. If the forces which are in opposition are 
supporters of the independence of Azerbaijan, we have, 
consequently, no difference of opinion. This is what our 
ideology is based on. 
  In the past, our ideology was Marxist-Leninist, and now we 
have rejected it. The representative of one party observed here 
that he is a supporter of socialism and is opposed to a market 
economy. This is his personal affair. But the majority of 
Azerbaijani society has rejected communist ideology and the 
building of socialism, and are supporters of Azerbaijan's taking 
the path of the building of an independent, secular, law-based 
state, founded on values common to all mankind and national 
traditions. 
  This, consequently, is our ideology. One part of it is 
composed of spiritual values and national traditions. We are 
true to all this--culture, religion, national spirit, all 
national traditions, and our history; I am not mistaken here, I 
believe. As far as our religion is concerned, I will give you 
one example. The Islamic religion is the religion that we have 
followed for many centuries. Not only the Islamic, but also all 
other religions, were in the Soviet Union under prohibition for 
70 years. We have now been given freedom and we have returned to 
our faith, and the freedom of worship of each individual is 
guaranteed. 
  And this being the case, if between the authorities and the 
opposition there are no ideological differences, there are other 
complaints here: "You are in office, and I am not; consequently, 
I will fight you in order to remove you and take your position 
myself." Come on, brother, let us finish the war, and you can 
take for yourself any position. But let us remember: The present 
implacable opposition held until recently all the high offices. 
No one took these offices away from these people; they left of 
their own accord. I have spoken about this repeatedly. 
  And for this reason there are no grounds here, in a country 
that has been at war for six years, for talking about power and 
opposition. There should be no talk about this. Mistakes of the 
state and the state authorities should undoubtedly be subjected 
to criticism. The authorities should know their mistakes, to 
avoid making them in the future. But this by no means signifies 
that it is necessary to adopt a hostile, treacherous, terrorist 
position in respect to them. There are currently among those in 
opposition persons who live by terrorist sentiments and are 
hatching terrorist plans. An investigation has shown that 
certain people were brought in here for the physical 
extermination of Geydar Aliyev and that measures for his removal 
at a particular time had been implemented. So what kind of 
opposition is this? What faith does it confess? 
  Do these terrorist organizations really want to save 
Azerbaijan from Armenian aggression, or have they chosen this 
path to achieve their personal ends? Terrorism is the meanest, 
dirtiest path. So it has been throughout history, in all states. 
There needs to be an end to this. As chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet, I treated such phenomena with patience and do so now 
also. But this does not mean that this patience is unlimited. 
  I believe that for Azerbaijan to be extricated from the 
state 
of war all forces must now unite. All specific proposals in this 
connection will be studied and applied. I have not heard any 
today. There was just one specific proposal--concerning the 
creation of a consultative council. I personally agree here. The 
state secretary will handle this matter. A consultative council 
should be created, evidently, in connection with the Karabakh 
problem. A general consultative council would enable us to 
achieve a great deal. It should be created in connection with 
the specific Karabakh problem, in order that this problem be 
tackled within its framework with regard to the existing 
proposals and possibilities. 
  If you wish to create a consultative council for the 
administration of the state, there is no need for this at this 
time, it seems to me. If the people have elected a president, he 
will take the necessary steps to administer the state. The 
Karabakh problem is the main problem for us. Together with the 
problem of how to extricate Azerbaijan from the state of war, 
there are undoubtedly other questions also, and they will not be 
overlooked, either. But a consultative council is needed for a 
solution merely of the Karabakh problem. If a consultative 
council were really to work actively and this problem were to be 
settled, this would be a notable event, because we have for six 
years been unable to resolve it. 
  Inasmuch as this is a very big problem, and since a specific 
discussion of ways out of the war seems unacceptable to some 
people at the present meeting, evidently, I ask the 
representatives of all the parties that are present here and of 
those that are not to present within five days' time specific 
proposals in writing on the Karabakh question and the country's 
withdrawal from the war. We will examine all of them in the 
consultative council, and I will examine them as president also. 
  You should know that from day one of my work as chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet through the present, I have devoted 80 
percent of my working day--and you know, most likely, that my 
working day is quite long--only to this question. There is no 
other solution. I personally have sought and continue to seek 
many paths. On a number of matters I have conferred with persons 
in my circle, members of the Defense Council included. Meetings 
and negotiations have been held here within the framework of 
Russia's mediation mission for a settlement of the Karabakh 
problem with Ambassador-at-Large Vladimir Kazimirov. As you 
know, I have taken a number of steps. Some people will like 
them, some, not, evidently. But all this--negotiations with the 
leadership of Armenia and of some of our officials with the 
leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh--represents steps dictated by 
necessity. I have conducted negotiations with the leadership of 
Russia, Turkey, and Iran and with representatives of the United 
States and other countries. There is no need, I believe, for me 
to tell you about all this. But I am trying and will continue to 
take advantage of all opportunities. Perhaps you have greater 
opportunities. Please, give us your proposals. We do not need 
empty words, accusations, squabbles, or rows; we need to present 
specific proposals. 
  Some of those who spoke here approved our successes in the 
achievement of a cease-fire. I will continue to endeavor to 
ensure, operating from these positions, that fire not be 
resumed. This is my personal position, and I will continue to 
work in this direction. But how far this activity will be 
successful I do not know. You have seen to what casualties the 
violation of the cease-fire agreement has led. I am taking 
certain steps in this sphere also. I said in my speech on 2 
November and I repeat now that I see a possibility of 
Azerbaijan's escape from the state of war and a return of the 
lands in peaceful fashion. If some people can assist in this 
direction, let him make his suggestion. Those, on the other 
hand, who think otherwise may present their proposals also. 
  At the same time, on the other hand, there is no doubt that 
we must strengthen our defense capability. It has been observed 
here that there have been many reasons for defeats. If the 
absence of internal stability and the weakness of the 
authorities may be cited among them, ineffective use has at the 
same time been made of the time since the winning of 
independence, and we have been unable to create an army capable 
of defending Azerbaijan. Mention has been made here of mafia 
groupings, instances of bribe-taking--all this has occurred. But 
mafia groupings have penetrated in great depth the army 
structure also. While blood was being spilled at the front, 
individual people here were appropriating monetary resources. At 
a time when people have been dying, losing their homes, and 
becoming refugees, some people, taking advantage of the 
situation, have been enriching themselves illegally. This is our 
misfortune, our tragedy. This also is why an army has not been 
created. 
  It is rumored--I touched on this yesterday in conversation 
with Etibar Mamedov--that certain battalions had been illegally 
disbanded, and this was the reason for a number of defeats. I am 
accustomed to speaking frankly. These inventions are far from 
the truth. Let us agree to be frank. Military matters are not 
decided by one person. Each party has the opportunity to apply 
to a state body in writing and to obtain a written response. But 
we should not be writing in the newspapers that one battalion 
did this, another battalion, the other, and so forth. 
  Yesterday I called in Etibar Mamedov's presence the chief of 
the Main Staff and told him that eight battalions had, it is 
said, been liquidated and that this was why we had been 
defeated. I ascertained that this was not the case. This is the 
information: Instead of the 400-500 men that a battalion should 
have, there were 15-18. And it is called a battalion, and money 
and provisions are issued for 400 men, and so forth. The 
military cited for me monstrous facts. In some army units both 
in the past and until recently, the commanders would five days 
before the issue of pay give 70-80 percent of the fighters home 
leave, appropriating their money for themselves. In addition, 
they would extort bribes from them so that they might be given 
home leave. When we revealed the truth, reporting this on 
television, some people objected: You cannot talk about the army 
this way. But what should we do? This is the truth, and without 
disclosing this truth, there is be no result. 
  All this--the fact that an army has not been formed as yet, 
that there have come to be negative elements in its ranks, that 
individual mafia groupings deriving personal gain from 
everything have begun to operate within the army (such, 
incidentally, was the grouping of Alikram Gumbatov, although 
many people spoke about him to me as a hero, yet he has done 
such thievery in the region as to have grabbed an armed 
unit)--is the most important reason for our defeats. 
  Our priority path is negotiations in various directions for 
a 
peaceful settlement of the problem. At the same time, on the 
other hand, we need to organize the army at the proper level, 
strengthen it, and form highly professional units so that 
Azerbaijan might defend itself both today and tomorrow and in 
five and 10 years' time. If Azerbaijan is an independent state, 
it should know how to defend itself. Whoever, therefore, has 
specific proposals on this issue and on the question of our 
peace negotiations and on the use of other possibilities of the 
state, let him say what paths he sees. Someone could, possibly, 
do something besides this also--let him say, and I will only be 
grateful. 
  In respect to the army: Let us reach agreement. It has been 
said here that the army needs political leaders. Indeed, there 
are 40 parties, and if each sends his representative, what would 
be the result? In the past there was one--the Communist 
Party--and each army subunit, from the platoon up, had a party 
organization and a deputy commander for political matters. In 
some instances other factors are employed, it is said. But it 
seems to me that if we concentrate all forces and appeal for 
assistance to the intelligentsia, religious figures, scientists, 
and respected persons, and if they can operate in organized 
fashion, performing the necessary work in the army units, and 
can foster in the fighters ethical and moral qualities and 
fortify their spirit and will--this will be both our political 
and ideological work. But this work should be performed not 
occasionally, but constantly and in organized fashion. 
  Other questions were broached also. I do not wish to dwell 
on 
them. We will work in the economic and other spheres. The 
preparations for an important conference on problems of the 
economy are under way at this time; it will be held on Friday, 
evidently. It was rightly mentioned here that the decline in 
production in both industry and agriculture has continued here 
in recent years and that the manufactured product is being 
squandered. We know that there is a big gap between exports and 
imports. Not even 10 percent of the value of the exported 
commodities has been returned to the republic in many sectors. 
All this has been lost somewhere and appropriated by individual 
persons. On the one hand, we are losing the republic's land; on 
the other, certain persons are weakening our already limited 
economic opportunities. We are dealing with these matters. 
  Some of those whose activity is connected with the economic 
sphere spoke here. I would ask that the parties present 
proposals on economic problems also. This would help us. We 
would examine and avail ourselves of them. But I would not want 
to start a wide-ranging discussion at this time. 
  I mentioned earlier that the main question is that of the 
war. Summing up the discussion of the war, there are some things 
that I would like to add. Let us agree: Let the newspapers stop 
using the subject of the war as an instrument of struggle. If 
this goes on, I shall avail myself of my powers to adopt the 
necessary measures. Proposals have been expressed here 
concerning the imposition in the republic of martial law or a 
state of emergency and the suspension of the activity of parties 
and newspapers. These proposals are well founded. I want to tell 
you frankly that, as president, I am assessing these proposals 
and thinking about this. But I would not want to resort to such 
extreme measures. But if it is necessary, to save the people, 
the republic, Azerbaijan, possibly, we will be forced to take 
serious steps. It has rightly been observed here that any step 
is justified in the name of the salvation of Azerbaijan. 
  I would like these questions to be tackled on the basis of 
mutual accord, national solidarity, and civic unity. This would 
attest to our high culture. It would show that we are really 
committed to democratic principles. At the same time, if we see 
that all is falling apart, we will then avail ourselves of any 
means, and this will be justified. I therefore warn the 
newspapers: The slander campaign against the president, the 
president's staff, the state secretary, and other officials must 
cease. Criticism and insults are not the same thing, this is the 
first point. Second, the criticism itself must be fair. 
  Certain speeches today were connected with personnel policy. 
We have still done nothing to respond. What sort of personnel 
policy can there be if there have still been no serious 
personnel transformations. There has long been such talk. At the 
same time, on the other hand, bear in mind that personnel policy 
is a most complex field. Many people have in this transitional 
period lost their sense of ethics, unfortunately. Yes, some are 
saying: Dismiss me; I will set up a commercial structure and 
live better than before. And this is truly the case. 
  It has been said today that bribe-taking has now assumed the 
greatest proportions. I disagree. I was in charge of this 
republic for 14 years, and right from the start of my activity 
through the last days, even when I left in 1982 to work in 
Moscow, up to and including my retirement in 1982, I fought 
against bribe-taking. How were people punished at that time? 
They were dismissed and expelled from the party (this was a big 
punishment at that time. There is now no Communist Party, and 
party expulsion is no longer frightening). Yes, I resorted to 
these measures. We punished by imprisonment also. But 
subsequently those who had been caught taking bribes donned the 
garb of "victims of the stagnation period" and came to occupy 
the highest positions. Are these the realities of our life? Is 
this our history of the past 20 years? I was a participant in 
this history. I was merciless toward bribe-takers. Both the 
person giving the bribe and the person taking it are criminally 
liable. People give bribes because they are accustomed to doing 
so. When I worked here, I was often told that some people, 
giving bribes, believed that they were in this way establishing 
a close relationship with those to whom they were being given. 
  When I retired, there was no one left by my side. Some 
people 
explained this by the fact that I was tied to no one. They said: 
You were tied only to an ideology, and now it has fallen apart 
also. Those who came after you were surrounded by people. Some 
live in Moscow or elsewhere, but they have their entourage. But 
I will never be bound by such ties. I am today also linked with 
the people spiritually and will live with this moral philosophy. 
  Do not think that I should fight bribe-taking alone. You 
must 
all fight it. But let us investigate which political party is 
fighting bribe-taking. Who is fighting the mafia groupings? 
Sponsorship is currently in vogue. Everyone has a sponsor. How 
are the newspapers published? When I worked in the Supreme 
Soviet, there was no possibility of publishing the newspaper 
AZERBAIJAN. The state had no money. But the newspaper 
DZHUMKHURRIYET appears three times a week, things are even 
better for the newspaper AZADLYG, and the newspaper MUSAVAT 
comes out more often than AZERBAIJAN. Where are they getting the 
money from? With what funds are they being published? Is it not 
the funds of the mafia groupings? Or perhaps they inherited the 
money with which they publish the newspapers? 
  Let us speak frankly. I have fought bribe-taking all my life 
and will continue to do so. At that time, even if people of the 
system, from my circle, were proving to be an obstacle, I would 
fight alone. It has happened also that on five occasions I 
dispatched a commission to look into the work of the first 
secretary of a district party committee, and everything was 
covered up. The sixth time I formed a commission that revealed 
everything. This person was expelled from the party and 
arrested. Then Vezirov came and extolled them all. And the 
newspapers wrote that whereas the punitive measures in 1937-1938 
had been carried out by Stalin and Bagirov, in the 1970's these 
punitive measures had been carried out by Geydar Aliyev. What 
punitive measures did I carry out? I was and will continue to be 
merciless toward bribe-takers. I was and will continue to be 
merciless toward thieves. I have never been nor will I ever be 
guided by personal interests. But you also should be the same. 
The whole people should be the same. Everyone is now saying: 
"Bribe-taking has the world in thrall." Very well, why do those 
who say this not grab the bribe-taker by the hand? If he 
subsequently does not incur punishment, we who are closing our 
eyes to this may then be held to account. 
  I agree entirely that not only now but yesterday, 10, 20 
years ago, our morals were damaged by bribe-taking. And this 
phenomenon is progressing from year to year. On account of a 
lack of discipline, on account of the fact that bribe-taking is 
widespread in the law enforcement authorities themselves, and 
its dimensions are spreading constantly, and we are duty-bound 
to fight it. Everyone must fight this, and each in his own 
sphere. If the political parties have ideas on this question and 
have specific considerations or information on actual instances 
of bribe-taking, we are prepared to use them. 
  Leave aside personnel policy. Mistakes may be made in 
personnel policy. We have not yet begun personnel policy. People 
are talking about Geydar Aliyev's circle. Who is in my circle? 
Just two or three persons. And I believe that they are serving 
the people loyally. Public opinion should not be shaped by 
spreading various rumors. 
  A proposal concerning the creation of a higher military 
inspectorate was made here. I believe that this is a workable 
proposal. We could implement it. 
  I hope that our present meeting will initiate all subsequent 
work. We will in the very near future adopt decisions on the 
proposals that have been expressed here--on the consultative 
council and the rest. I ask the political parties once again to 
present within five days' time their proposals for what can be 
done both in respect to negotiations and in the sphere of 
military organizational development. I express my gratitude in 
advance. 
  I believe that we have had a productive discussion. If you 
have no objections and if you show an interest, I intend to 
continue our meetings. I hope that they will be useful. 
  I thank everyone once again for their proposals and 
opinions, 
and I hope that today's meeting will become a factor laying the 
foundation of civil unity and civil solidarity in Azerbaijan. Au 
revoir.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the </F>
Bank of Russia, by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent Pavel 
Lukyanchenko; place and date not given: "The `Artificial' Ruble"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of January of this year 
the exchange rate of the dollar has soared from 1,250 rubles [R] 
to R1,627 and subsequently fallen to R1,565. Many people 
attributed this sharp drop in the exchange rate to the collusion 
of currency speculators who "are making billions from this 
game." However, in reality the intercession, or currency 
intervention, of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation was 
the actual reason for the drop in the exchange rate. Why is such 
currency intervention needed? What is the mechanism used? How 
much does it cost us? Our correspondent, Pavel Lukyanchenko, 
asked Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Bank of 
Russia, to answer these and other questions. 
  [Khandruyev] The essence of currency interventions that are 
undertaken by the central banks of all countries of the world is 
as follows: to keep the exchange rate of the national currency 
within certain limits. To this end, the central state bank 
either buys foreign currency on the currency exchange, thus 
lowering the exchange rate of its national currency, or sells 
foreign currency--as a result of which the exchange rate of the 
national currency grows. The currency reserves of central banks 
are far from always sufficient to support the exchange rate of 
the national monetary unit, and in this case a devaluation is 
effected, that is, it becomes cheaper compared to the dollar, 
the deutsche mark, and so on. 
  [Lukyanchenko] How large are the currency reserves of the 
Central Bank of Russia? 
  [Khandruyev] As of the end of the year they came to $4.4 
billion. 
  [Lukyanchenko] What is the specific mechanism of currency 
intervention? 
  [Khandruyev] If the demand for dollars on the exchange 
exceeds supply, for example, if on a specific day demand comes 
to $100 million while only $20 million is for sale, the Central 
Bank puts up for sale the lacking $80 million. Therefore, on 
this day the exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar does 
not change compared to the previous trading session. This is 
what artificial support for the ruble is all about; its meaning 
is to prevent abrupt changes in the exchange rate, which always 
have a detrimental effect on the condition of the economy and 
price levels. However, since production continues to slump and 
prices to grow in our country, we lower the exchange rate of the 
ruble little by little. Of course, for a certain period of time 
it is possible to sustain a greatly overstated exchange rate of 
the ruble against the dollar. However, more currency needs to be 
unloaded on the market in this case. Where does the currency go? 
As a rule it is deposited in the accounts of the banks' clients, 
and later often moved abroad. This is why your readers should 
understand that it is not necessarily bad for the exchange rate 
of the ruble to fall. 
  [Lukyanchenko] What is the specific size of currency 
interventions by the Central Bank? 
  [Khandruyev] We do not divulge this in order not to whet the 
appetites of currency speculators. 
  [Lukyanchenko] As I understand it, the currency reserves of 
the Central Bank are virtually a dead weight. Why not make them 
work actively for Russia? They say that at present $1 million 
can be turned into $1.5 million in our country within one month. 
  [Khandruyev] Naturally, the currency reserve of the Central 
Bank is placed abroad in the accounts of high-class banks, at 
3-5 percent annual rates of interest. Only swindlers get 50 
percent in our country. I strongly advise citizens against 
getting involved with companies engaging in speculative 
operations. High rates of profit are always accompanied by the 
colossal risk of never recouping the invested funds. 
  [Lukyanchenko] They say that some Swiss banks exchange our 
rubles into [hard] currency. 
  [Khandruyev] It is possible. There are various interests, 
for 
example, to maintain our embassy staff in Moscow--it is cheaper 
to pay for outlays in rubles. Possibly they need money for 
intelligence, too. However, in either case Western banks 
exchange money at a rate that is not advantageous for the ruble. 
  [Lukyanchenko] My final question. Is it true that the 
Central 
Bank still exchanges even "Pavlov's" R50 bills? 
  [Khandruyev] It is. If an old woman comes to us and says: 
"Boys, yesterday I found three bills in the pocket of the pants 
of my late husband, and you know what kind of retirement 
benefits I get...." Of course, for an old woman like this we 
will exchange both "Pavlov's" and the recently withdrawn Russian 
rubles. However, had she come to us with the same words and O.5 
million of the old bills, this conversation would not have taken 
place. 
<H5>  Rumor Has It </H5>
  Commercial circles are seriously concerned about leaked 
information that a redenomination of the bills currently in use 
at a ratio of 1,000:1 will be carried out soon, with the 
exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble being 
simultaneously set at 1:1, and that all private banks will have 
their licenses to perform exchange operations with currency 
revoked; these operations will become the prerogative of only 
the Central Bank of Russia. A highly placed government official 
whom we asked to comment on the rumor answered unambiguously: 
"This is quite possible."

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Popov: "Anti-Zhirinovskiy Pill, Or the </F>
Art Of Empty Diplomatic Mumbling"] 
  [Text] The "Segodnya" television program showed Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev's press conference on the 
occasion of the arrival to Moscow of the cochairmen of the 
conference on Yugoslavia, Owen and Stoltenberg. In answer to the 
question as to whether Zhirinovskiy's shadow is hovering over 
the negotiations, Kozyrev joked in his usual manner: The Russian 
MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], he said, proposes to announce 
a competition to invent an anti-Zhirinovskiy pill, since this 
is, he said, a medical rather than political matter. 
  Behind the attempts at lightheartedness, however, there was 
easily detectable irritation caused by the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] leader's trip to Yugoslavia, which 
reverberated widely around the world. Many thousands of people 
flocked to Zhirinovskiy's rallies in Beograd, Belica, Vukovar, 
and Podgorica. Serbs like people who are not at a loss for words 
and express their thoughts straight, without subterfuge, albeit 
in a paradoxical manner. Judging by the comments in the 
international press and Western radio programs, Zhirinovskiy was 
clearly at his best; he was especially successful in variations 
on the Pan-Slavic theme that is very popular here. 
  At the beginning of the 1980's, when I happened to work in 
Yugoslavia, I heard more than once from my interlocutors--and 
especially frequently in Serbia and Montenegro--the same popular 
expression on blood ties with Russians: "Mi smo jedna porodicha 
ot Japana do Jadrana!" In Russian this means: "We are one 
family--from the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Jadran"--this is 
what they call in Yugoslavia perhaps the bluest and warmest sea 
on our planet--the Adriatic Sea. 
  One may assume that the LDPR leader, too, heard (and most 
likely more than once) this folksy geopolitical formula in his 
travels through formerly splendid parts which now, alas, have 
become the arena of horrible endless bloodshed. By the way, 
increasingly more international analysts are coming to the 
conclusion that had the Soviet Union not disintegrated, the 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have continued 
its prosperous existence, too, glorifying in Serbian and 
Croatian, Slovenian and Macedonian, Albanian and Hungarian, and 
many other languages the tightly knit family-"porodica." 
  Should we be surprised then that Zhirinovskiy, with his 
predilection for geopolitical issues, did not pass up the topic 
of "Japana and Jadrana" at Yugoslav rallies? According to a BBC 
radio commentary, the LDPR leader described his vision of a 
Pan-Slavic state from Vladivostok to Knin, the capital of the 
not-yet-recognized Serbska Krajina republic, causing a 
diplomatic demarche on the part of Croatia, which does not 
recognize this territory, populated by Serbs since time 
immemorial, as an independent Serbian state. But the Krajina 
Serbs have their own opinion on the subject. As Milan Martic, 
recently elected president of Krajina, said: "We need Russia's 
help; we need Russia to say its word!" 
  Whether Kozyrev likes it or not, Zhirinovskiy was treated in 
Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Serbska Krajina 
as a representative of Russia, who finally--for the first time 
in the past few years, since the beginning of the 
perestroyka-reformist nightmare!--says exactly what the Great 
Brotherly Russia should have said! Let the West rail over 
Zhirinovskiy supporting the idea of Great Serbia, but what is 
there actually so seditious in it for a Serb, a Russian, or a 
Slav in general?! 
  I can imagine the storm of elation Zhirinovskiy's words 
caused at a rally in the city of Belica: "Serbs can always count 
on Russia to protect them. Air strikes against Serbian positions 
would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia!" 
  One can only regret that these words were not said by the 
president of Russia! The Western mass media emphasize in 
connection with Zhirinovskiy's tour that his views do not 
reflect the position of the Russian MFA. Meanwhile, it would be 
more correct to put it this way: The current position of the 
Russian authorities does not reflect the will of the voters 
expressed in the elections of 12 December 1993. 
  Let us look, however, at how promising Kozyrev's idea 
regarding a competition to come up with an anti-Zhirinovskiy 
pill may turn out. One would assume that the ideal effect of 
this medication, in Kozyrev's mind, would be the phenomenon of 
that particular "refined diplomatic mumbling" which was 
identified and described in detail in his book "If in doubt, 
mumble!" ("The Bureaucrat's Handbook") by James Boren, a former 
U.S. Department of State functionary turned sociologist and 
political scientist. The hero of his tale is Probur 
(professional bureaucrat), a master of "decisive shelving" and 
"constructive red tape." The apotheosis of Probur's art is 
enthusiastic mumbling, which allows him "to use empty language 
forms to express great concern, deep thinking, and absolute 
competence." 
  It remains unknown whether it is with the aid of already 
secretly produced pills or simply by lucky inspiration, but 
refined diplomatic mumbling is already widely used in Kozyrev's 
MFA. At that same press conference after the negotiations with 
Owen and Stoltenberg, the Russian minister demonstrated empty 
mumbling of the highest international class. For instance, 
delivering a soliloquy that the "peace process in Yugoslavia is 
not dead; it will continue, and there is a chance to 
reinvigorate this process." Next, however, in discouragingly 
destructive dissonance to the above, came a cheerful 
journalistic commentary: "The meeting participants did not 
preclude the use of air strikes in Bosnia." 
  The Russian MFA is as usual obscuring the issue, trying to 
drown the substance of its position in obfuscation, widely using 
"yes" in which one keeps hearing "no," and "no" with an easily 
detectable "yes" in it... U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, 
on the other hand, does not find it expedient to keep things 
close to his chest and says, for instance, absolutely straight 
that he approves the report of the UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali since "it opens the way for potential use of 
military might." 
  What the very first manifestation of this military might may 
be was stated in the television report for "Segodnya" by the 
journalist Sergey Gryzunov: One of the first two targets for a 
NATO aircraft bombing raid is Tuzla, where, by the way, a 
battalion of Russian volunteers is fighting on the side of 
Bosnian Serbs, and thus, said the journalist, who has not yet 
mastered the art of empty diplomatic mumbling and therefore 
still calls things by their proper names, "a situation may 
develop whereby Americans will be bombing Russians." 
  The Russian MFA, meanwhile, is talking about an 
anti-Zhirinovskiy pill! Perhaps the LDPR leader should announce 
a counter-competition--for the best medicine against Proburs who 
disregard the national interests of the country they represent. 
<H5>  Meanwhile, Americans Rejoice </H5>
  If Russia begins to conduct a policy that will return us to 
the period of the "cold war," this will inflict irreparable 
damage to the national security of the United States. This 
thought was put forward on Tuesday by the (U.S.) President's 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in an interview to the 
CNN television company. 
  Commenting on the statement by LDPR leader V. Zhirinovskiy 
that a NATO air strike against Serbian positions in Bosnia and 
Hercegovina will be tantamount to a declaration of war against 
Russia, A. Lake said: "I think we should be glad that 
Zhirinovskiy is not speaking on behalf of the Russian government 
and does not participate in the formulation of Russia's foreign 
policy. Had it happened, we would now be arguing with Russia 
about who owns Alaska. Seriously speaking, our assessment of the 
parliamentary elections in Russia tells us that in voting for 
Zhirinovskiy the Russians voted against the economic situation 
in the country and not for nationalism. We should not, however, 
underestimate nationalist moods in Russia. Therefore our 
'Partnership for Peace' initiative assumes not only expanding 
NATO membership by adding East European countries and the 
integration of Russia into a new unified Europe, but also 
provides the former communist countries with a security 
guarantee in the event of the potential ascension to power of a 
nationalist leader in Russia. We do not think that this will 
happen. We do not think that Zhirinovskiy speaks on behalf of 
the majority of Russians."

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Imedashvili: "Yeltsin Was Met in Tbilisi </F>
With Music"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Mikhail Ukleba: "Today's Realities Permit the Development of 
Good-Neighbor Relations..." </H3>
  A president of Russia has for the first time visited an 
independent Georgia. "In the age-old history of Georgian-Russian 
relations this is a significant event," Eduard Shevardnadze 
declared. "Russian leaders came to Georgia earlier also, but 
they came as to a colony...." At the airport the head of the 
Russian state was greeted by an orchestra. But only the 
initiated know that for want of suitable musicians in Tbilisi, 
worn out by war and political strife, the presidential orchestra 
had been brought into the city several days prior to this. 
  "The Friendship, Good-Neighborliness, and Cooperation Treaty 
is a symbol of the new relations between Russia and 
Georgia"--this was how Mikhail Ukleba, deputy minister of 
foreign affairs of the Republic of Georgia, characterized the 
significance of the Russian president's visit in conversation 
with your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. "The Russian and 
Georgian delegations performed a great deal of work. There were 
five rounds of negotiations to prepare the documents, on the 
basis of which mutual relations between the two states will be 
built. Permanent political dialogue will enable us to develop 
good-neighbor relations, and in the future, possibly, allied 
relations at a new level. A great deal has to be done to restore 
the traditional economic relations. We are confronted with the 
task of a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and the 
Tskhinvali region." 
<H3>  Snap Poll for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of Leaders of Georgia's 
Political Parties </H3>
  Georgiy Chanturia, chairman of the National 
Democratic Party of Georgia: "We take a positive view of the 
visit and see it as an opportunity for a settlement of relations 
between Russia and Georgia. How successful this proves will 
depend to a large extent on Mr. Yeltsin and what Russia wants to 
see in the shape of Georgia: an independent neighbor or a 
semi-colonial country. We understand by the rapprochement of the 
two states civilized mutual relations and we support such a 
policy. But we are categorically opposed to agreements that 
could be followed by a loss of Georgian statehood." 
  Vazha Adamia, chairman of the Merab Kostava 
Society: "We are for cooperation and a strengthening of 
contacts. But not such as Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the 
Georgian state, proposes. We are opposed to enslaving agreements 
and opposed to his decision concerning Georgia's membership in 
the CIS." 
  Irakliy Tsereteli, chairman of the National 
Independence Party: "Our party's attitude toward the visit is 
unequivocal: The head of a state which since 1921 has 
perpetrated against Georgia permanent aggression is coming to 
independent Georgia. Russian forces of occupation are still 
here. Yeltsin's visit will have bad results for Georgia, 
primarily because it is Shevardnadze, who is his 'assistant,' 
who will be meeting him. 
  Nodar Natadze, leader of the Popular Front of 
Georgia: "The visit is in itself a positive phenomena, but I 
have no great hopes that this might exert a positive influence 
on the situation in Abkhazia or South Ossetia." 
  Guram Muchaidze, leader of the Social Democratic 
Party of the Republic of Georgia: "We advocate the maximum 
rapprochement with Russia. We welcome any steps aimed at the 
establishment of good-neighbor relations. Had we moved toward a 
rapprochement with Russia earlier, Georgia would not be in the 
deplorable condition in which it finds itself today. As far as 
the signing of the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between 
Georgia and Russia is concerned, we may say just one thing: 
better late than never."

<F P=106> [Remarks by Emil Pain, Presidential Council member, recorded </F>
by Mari Silven: "'The Political Climate Is Manifestly 
Inauspicious...'"] 
  [Text] "The atmosphere for the visit is quite strange, and 
it is hard for me to select an analogy even. Yeltsin is going to 
a country whose public opinion considers Russia to blame for its 
biggest national defeat," Emil Pain, member of the Presidential 
Council, told your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent on the eve of 
the visit. "The psychological atmosphere in Georgian society is 
anti-Russian Federation and anti-Russian. All parties have 
decisively protested Russia's policy. Were Russian-Georgian 
relations already 'full' interstate relations, the president 
would hardly be going to a country whose political climate is so 
manifestly inauspicious for an official visit. There is a great 
danger that there will be in such a situation, instead of 
interstate negotiations, simply a meeting of two people. 
  "There were for a long time many inhibitory factors, and the 
date of the visit had been postponed several times. It was 
primarily the state of war with Abkhazia which was getting in 
the way. Politically, the problem has yet to be resolved, but 
the hostilities have ceased, and this creates the minimum 
prerequisites for the visit. The second aspect is the position 
of the North Caucasus republics opposed to a rapprochement of 
Russia and Georgia. Since the October events relations between 
the president and the republics have changed quite radically 
compared with what they were like under the conditions of 
diarchy, which made the trip to Tbilisi possible. I assume that 
the Russian-American summit also exerted an influence to some 
extent. America is very concerned by Russia's position in 
relation to Georgia, and the question of a reconciliation and of 
Russia's more benevolent attitude toward Georgia was, evidently, 
studied during the preparation for Clinton's visit and during 
his time in Moscow. Georgia had been seeking the conclusion of a 
treaty with Russia throughout the past year. Tbilisi had an 
interest primarily in the regulation and establishment of the 
borders of the Georgian state and recognition of its integrity. 
The signing of such a treaty would signify that 
Russia--officially, at least--is not an ally of Abkhazia. Hopes 
for some economic assistance are also linked with the treaty 
for, after all, the population of Georgia is receiving a 
blockade bread ration. 
  Russia's first geopolitical interest in such a treaty 
consists of the firmness of its borders. It is not at all a 
matter of indifference to us whom Chechnya borders and how 
friendly toward us the regime of the neighboring country is. The 
second: Russia aspires to support democratic regimes, and any 
subsequent regime in Georgia will be, from Russia's viewpoint, 
worse for it than the present one. And the third: a general 
regulation of mutual relations in the post-Soviet world.

<F P=106> [Report by Seyfali Akhundov: "Andrey Dzhergenia: `The Visit </F>
Will Exacerbate the Antagonism...'"] 
  [Text] Russian officials stated repeatedly that the signing 
of an interstate agreement between Georgia and Russia was 
possible only after a settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian 
conflict. It would seem Moscow has changed its attitude toward 
this center of tension in the Caucasus. 
  The visit to Georgia by the president of Russia will 
exacerbate the situation along the line of opposition of the 
Abkhaz and Georgian forces. Despite the fact that combat 
operations have not been conducted for quite some time now, the 
signing of a Russian-Georgian treaty providing for military 
assistance to the Shevardnadze government will initiate a new 
twist of the spiral of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict. This is 
what Andrey Dzhergenia, personal representative of the chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia, said on the 
eve of Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi. 
  The events of recent years testify that, having obtained 
weapons from Russia, Georgia will abandon a peaceful solution to 
the conflict, Dzhergenia believes. This was the case in 1992, 
when, in accordance with the Tashkent Agreement, the Republic of 
Georgia was handed heavy weapons that had previously belonged to 
the Soviet Army, and the troops of the State Council entered 
Abkhaz territory shortly after. In an appeal of the Supreme 
Soviet of this self-proclaimed republic to the Russian 
Federation president, the chairman of the Council of Ministers, 
and the speakers of the Federation Council and the State Duma 
the Abkhaz side requested that the treaty not be signed. 
Otherwise Russia could no longer play the part of objective 
mediator in a settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict since 
it and a subject of the protracted dispute would hence forward 
be bound by allied relations. Having signed the treaty, Abkhazia 
believes, the Russian leader will have deprived himself also of 
important levers of pressure on Tbilisi in a solution to the 
problems of South Ossetia. 
  The personal representative of the chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Abkhazia refrained from comment on the changes in 
Moscow's foreign policy course in the Caucasus, but acknowledged 
that a rapprochement of Russia and Georgia was fraught with the 
danger of an exacerbation of the situation in the region. The 
heads of the North Caucasus republics held a joint meeting on 31 
January at which they condemned the position occupied by Russia 
in respect to Abkhazia and declared the need for retaliatory 
measures.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Nadein-Rayevskiy: "Russia and the Central </F>
Asian States: Chances of Integration"] 
  [Text] Tendencies toward integration and separation can be 
seen in Russia's relations with the new states of Central Asia. 
The former tendencies were submerged in the atmosphere of 
euphoria in the sovereign entities after the collapse of the 
USSR, but common interests have been having an increasingly 
strong impact since that time. Mutual interests in the spheres 
of economics, defense, security, and the protection of the 
external borders of the CIS have the greatest integrating 
potential. The factors contributing to separation include the 
view of national statehood as the extreme form of isolation, the 
search for new partners and "patrons" supposedly capable of 
solving internal problems in the new independent republics, and 
detachment from former "union relatives" in an attempt to 
maintain the authority of the old elite. 
  Enough has already been said about the economy as one of the 
major spheres of integration, and for this reason I will be 
discussing other uniting factors. 
  The first of these is the defense sphere. Russia certainly 
does not want its "soft underbelly" to turn into a zone of 
confrontations and local wars. The Russians are still not 
accustomed to seeing the strictly Russian borders as their own 
boundaries. They are still thinking in terms of the union. 
Furthermore, they are not the only ones: This is also true of 
much of the population of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The 
presence of external dangers, particularly from Afghanistan and 
Iran, probably will be acknowledged in the near future. 
  Security issues have also required a reassessment. Russia 
does not have to guard against attacks by the traditional 
enemies of the Russian empire and the USSR. Its "central" 
location in Eurasia separates it from Europe by two buffer 
zones: the territory of the former republics of the USSR and the 
territory of the former socialist countries. These zones are a 
more than adequate guarantee against any potential Western 
threat to Russia. This double safety zone is also completely 
adequate for Russia in the event of conventional warfare. The 
USSR's longtime adversary--the United States--is dangerous only 
in the event of a global conflict, which seems virtually 
impossible at this time, particularly in view of the signed 
nuclear arms reduction treaties. 
  Russia's longest border is with China, and China can 
certainly be seen as a potential threat in some respects. The 
Chinese leadership once tried to lay claim to 1.54 million 
square kilometers of Soviet territory that is now part of Russia 
and Kazakhstan, but no demands of this kind have been made in 
recent years. China was given several hundred islands on the 
Amur River after successful negotiations to settle these 
disputes. There are no problems on the Russian-Korean and 
Russian-Mongolian borders, and Norway and Finland have not made 
any official territorial claims either. 
  The potential threat could come from our former associates 
in 
the empire, particularly if extremist, nationalist, or 
religious-nationalist groups should rise to a position of power 
there, especially now that some representatives of social 
movements in the Central Asian states have already made 
territorial claims on Russia. This is why Russia has an interest 
in preserving the stability of moderate political regimes that 
can maintain smooth interstate relations and encourage 
integration processes within the CIS framework. 
  In view of current objective circumstances, Russia should 
not 
be the only one concerned about the security of external 
borders. The Central Asian states have an equal interest in this 
matter. Completely obvious sources of potential danger exist on 
their southern borders. Above all, they include Iran, which has 
exported revolution in the past, although the people of Iran are 
no longer inclined to give all of the expansionist ambitions of 
their leadership unconditional support. They also include 
Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a civil war that is 
gradually acquiring the features of an inter-ethnic and 
inter-religious conflict. Tajiks and Uzbeks live on both sides 
of the border of the former USSR, and there are several million 
of them in Afghanistan. Ahmad-shah Masoud, the acknowledged 
leader of the Afghan Dari (Tajiks), has effectively set up his 
own state in the north of Afghanistan, while the unified state 
in Tajikistan is still only in the formative stage. The 
possibility of expansionist ambitions on the part of some 
leaders of ethnic communities in Afghanistan cannot be excluded. 
Although Tajikistan is far away from Russia and does not have 
any common borders with it, Russian military units were 
nevertheless drawn into the internal conflict there during the 
civil war in that republic. Furthermore, the destabilization of 
Tajikistan could disrupt the balance of power in the whole 
region and jeopardize Russia's economic and political interests. 
  The situation in Turkmenistan, with its clearly defined 
populist policy line, is more stable. The republic leadership, 
headed by "Turkmen-bashi" ("Turkmen leader") Saparmurad Niyazov, 
has a good chance of maintaining economic and, consequently, 
social stability because of the republic's large supplies of 
natural gas. In turn, social stability probably will allow the 
authoritarian regime to retain strict control over all other 
spheres of life in the state for a fairly long time. 
  The regime in Uzbekistan is more or less stable. President 
Islam Karimov has provided hundreds of thousands of families 
with land and low-income strata with stronger social guarantees, 
which has allowed him to take a hard line in relations with the 
opposition without any fear of mass demonstrations in support of 
the opposition. When I. Karimov says: "Our people are not ready 
for democracy," he is probably right in many respects, although 
this position cannot appeal to the Russian leadership. 
  There is a regrettable tendency toward the ideologization of 
interstate relations in Russian foreign policy. Their 
development occasionally depends on feelings of sympathy or 
antipathy for a particular regime, political order, or political 
figure. I feel that this tendency could endanger Russia's 
national interests, which consist primarily in the maintenance 
of stability on its borders and in the region as a whole. 
  Complex problems in Russia's relations with the Central 
Asian 
states are connected with the Russian and Russian-speaking 
population in the region. Kazakhstan has the largest Russian 
community--6.2 million people. There were 1.6 million Russians 
living in Uzbekistan in 1989 (now the number is lower), and 
there were more than 900,000 in Kirghizia, over 300,000 in 
Turkmenia, and approximately the same number in Tajikistan. This 
factor could contribute to integration and separation in 
Russia's relations with the countries of the region. 
  Before the revolution the Russian population lived mainly in 
the cities serving as administrative centers of the empire and 
reached a high level of assimilation there. The level of 
integration was much lower for the new settlers of the Soviet 
period. In addition to the construction workers and skilled 
laborers who moved there during the period of industrialization, 
there were also former convicts, who were forbidden to live in 
Russia's big cities, and people with no definite social status. 
The behavior and lifestyle of these last two groups did not 
contribute to friendly relations between the Russians and the 
native population and strengthened tendencies toward separation. 
  On the other hand, Russians play the key role in industrial 
production in the region, and their departure will lead 
unavoidably to a recession in industry and even to the closure 
of enterprises. The leaders of the Central Asian republics are 
trying to stop, or at least stem, the process of emigration, 
while nationalist movements are doing the opposite--encouraging 
it in every way possible. Unfortunately, the activities of the 
latter have been much more effective, because governments 
operate on the macrolevel while nationalists can influence 
individuals. Threatening letters and telephone calls, physical 
assaults, property damage, and other such actions have a greater 
impact than official assurances of commitment to human rights 
and liberties. 
  The emigrants from the Central Asian region in Russia are 
more likely to play a separating role. Millions of refugees 
could change public opinion in Russia dramatically, directing it 
into the channels of negative feelings about the CIS. 
Developments of this type, which are already apparent in several 
regions, include the anti-Armenian demonstrations in Stavropol 
and the anti-Caucasus feelings in large Russian cities (although 
they are of a different nature). More and more people are 
beginning to feel that Russia should "withdraw" from Central 
Asia and the Caucasus. 
  Under certain circumstances the "Turkish factor" could 
become 
one of the external obstacles to Russia's integration with the 
Central Asian states. When the new states of Central Asia were 
choosing a development option, they turned to the Turkish model 
first. This model, however, has certain distinctive features 
preventing its use in its entirety and with the same degree of 
effectiveness as in Turkey. First of all, the Turkish economy 
was not as centralized and monopolized as the economies of the 
Central Asian states when the changes started there in the early 
1980s. In the second place, the Turks did not go through an era 
of socialism and were not infected by its mentality. After all, 
the Soviet people are convinced that someone is obligated to 
help them: the state, "foreign countries," or their "big Russian 
brother," and they are less likely to rely on themselves. Of 
course, new attitudes have emerged in the region recently. The 
Turkophile euphoria of late 1991 and the first half of 1992, 
which was based on the anticipation of immediate miracles, is 
beginning to give way to a more realistic approach, with 
consideration for historical traditions, established ties, and 
so forth. The lack of offers of generous financial aid, and the 
fact that the "language common to all Turks" turned out to be a 
myth, apparently played a role in this process. The languages of 
the Turkic peoples are quite different from Turkish. 
Furthermore, the prospect of integration with Russia and other 
republics of the former USSR turned out to be much stronger than 
Turkey expected. Finally, the possibilities of trade between 
Central Asian republics and Turkey are limited. Turkey does not 
need agricultural products, and Central Asian energy resources 
are still inaccessible to Turkey because of the great distances, 
the absence of a transport infrastructure, and the high cost of 
establishing one. The high level of Europeanization in the 
Central Asian republics could also play a role in the future. In 
comparison with Turkey as a whole, rather than with Ankara, 
Izmir, or Istanbul, the level of Europeanization is higher in 
the former Soviet republics. This is likely to discourage the 
"Turkish" view of the world, based on the supposed superiority 
of the Turks to other people. The efforts to strengthen the 
Turkish influence in the Central Asian republics have distinct 
pan-Turkic features. The mass media were open to propaganda of 
the pan-Turkic ideas of "Turkic unity" and the creation of 
"Great Turan" ("Great Turkey," "Great Turkestan," etc.). The 
traditional anti-Russian aims of the pan-Turkic movement will 
work against the process of Russia's integration with Central 
Asia. 
  Some of the internal Russian factors complicating Russia's 
integration with the Central Asian states within the CIS 
framework are purely psychological, but they can take the form 
of actual policy. Above all, these include the nationalist 
attitudes in Russia itself, which are frequently directed 
against "foreigners." The collapse of the USSR contributed to 
the growth of these attitudes. There is also the fear, 
engendered by these attitudes, that Muslim Turks will eventually 
constitute the majority in the "integrated" Commonwealth. These 
fears were present even in the Brezhnev years and are nothing 
new, but they have not promoted isolationist attitudes until 
now. Overcoming them in a short time would be difficult, 
especially when everyday life is more likely to strengthen them. 
  Therefore, we still are not completely cognizant of the 
importance of the Central Asian region in Russian foreign 
policy. We still have not completely recognized the economic 
interests dictating the need for closer cooperation with the 
countries of Central Asia. The actual intensification of 
integration processes within the CIS will depend largely on the 
development of Russia itself, on the success or failure of its 
reforms.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Babak: "Problems in Russian-Central Asian </F>
Integration"] 
  [Text] It is probably too early to discern any specific and 
lasting characteristics of the new Russia's relations with the 
independent states of Central Asia. These relations are still 
being established, and they are being influenced by many 
different factors. 
  Relations between Russia and its neighbors in the southeast 
never had a "horizontal" structure. In other words, they were 
never equal, and this includes all seven decades of the Soviet 
era. The structure was always clearly "vertical." Certain 
stereotypes in approaches to these relations still exist in 
Moscow and in the capitals of the new states. Some Russian 
officials are inclined to view the former Central Asian 
republics as second-rate states and to believe that relations 
with them are of much less importance than relations with 
Ukraine, Belarus, and the republics of the Transcaucasus, not to 
mention the "distant foreign countries." 
  This obvious underestimation of the new states by Russian 
officials has been due and is still due to two main factors. The 
first is the legacy of the past, when these republics were seen 
by the former center not only as entities that were less 
developed in the economic and technological sense and in other 
respects, but also as less significant entities, bound by their 
subordinate position to "swallow" anything Moscow offered them. 
The continued underestimation of the new states by the present 
Russian leadership is particularly apparent in the 
incomprehensible indifference with which Moscow reacted to the 
tragedy in Tajikistan, as if all of this were happening not in 
one of the former union republics, but in Sri Lanka, Colombia, 
or some other country where events would not and could not 
affect Russia in the least. 
  In the second place, this underestimation of the states of 
the region stems from the exaggerated view of the role of the 
United States and the Western powers in Russia's future. This 
view of the West's exceptional role in the fate of today's 
Russian Federation sometimes leaves no time or place for the 
necessary consideration of other states in the contemporary 
world, including the "former relatives" from the so-called 
nearby foreign countries. 
  It is probable that people in Alma-Ata and in other capitals 
of the new states southeast of Moscow are aware of this lack of 
Russian consideration and are drawing their own conclusions from 
this. In this context, it is interesting to recall that the 
leaders of Kazakhstan and the Central Asian states met in 
Ashgabat for their own conference just a few days after the 
leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met in Belovizh Woods. 
There is some indication that President N. Nazarbayev of 
Kazakhstan made a great effort at that meeting to persuade his 
colleagues from neighboring countries to "overlook" Moscow's 
obviously tactless behavior and to consent to participation in 
the new commonwealth of the former Soviet republics. After all, 
at that time there was still a strong possibility that a 
"Slavic" CIS-I and a "Turkic-Islamic" CIS-II would rise from the 
ruins of the USSR. 
  The declaration of the CIS would seem to have created real 
opportunities for genuinely equitable relations between Russia 
and these countries, based on the total and actual sovereignty 
of each state, but the existence of these opportunities did not 
necessarily mean that these relations would be established in 
the near future. The nature of these relations would also be 
influenced considerably by the fact that the Central Asian 
states would be incapable of living as truly autonomous entities 
for a long time.* (Footnote: A study of the viability of the 
former Soviet republics as independent states by experts from 
Deutsche Bank, based on an analysis of 12 major economic, 
social, and geopolitical parameters, is interesting in this 
context. Each parameter was graded on a scale of 10, and the 
maximum number of points was therefore 120. According to this 
method, the most viable of the countries of the region was 
Kazakhstan, which was given only 55 points. The scores of the 
other republics were even lower: 32 for Uzbekistan, 27 for 
Turkmenistan, 24 for Kyrgyzstan, and 18 for Tajikistan.) After 
all, the sovereignization of the former Soviet republics was not 
a sudden and immediate act, culminating in the declaration of 
independence, but a fairly long and complex process of 
transition, including, in particular, a transition from one set 
of relations with Moscow to another set based on absolutely 
different principles. The main distinctive feature of this 
transition period is the need for the simultaneous resolution of 
a large group of problems connected with the establishment of 
independence. 
  Genuine independence requires certain economic, political, 
and other prerequisites. In particular, it requires an economy 
capable of supplying the population of these republics with at 
least the minimum needed for survival, either by means of 
domestic production or by means of trade with other states. 
Unfortunately, the legacy most of the Central Asian states 
received from the earlier regime is of no help at all in the 
satisfactory attainment of this goal. On the economic level, 
republics like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are insolvent and have 
to depend to a considerable extent on financial support from 
other states, primarily Russia. As for Kazakhstan and 
Turkmenistan, the presence of a variety of commercial minerals 
(in Kazakhstan) or of large deposits of energy resources, 
primarily gas and oil (in Turkmenistan), makes their hope of 
economic independence more realistic. The situation with regard 
to Uzbekistan, which also has a variety of natural resources, is 
approximately the same. 
  Russia and its Central Asian partners in the former union 
are 
victims of the earlier centralized system of economic 
management. It inflicted much more damage, however, on the 
republics of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Their economies are 
almost colonial. This has made the new states in the region 
extremely dependent on the economic ties that were forged in the 
Soviet (and in some cases, pre-Soviet) era, especially with 
Russia. Their excessive and clearly asymmetrical economic 
dependence on Russia is influencing bilateral relations with 
Moscow, distorting ties, precluding a truly equitable 
association, and contributing to the preservation of the earlier 
relationship between the center and the periphery. 
  Meanwhile, Moscow's inability, for several reasons, to give 
the states of Central Asia the necessary assistance and its 
apparent economic insolvency as an effective benefactor have 
promoted processes of alienation from Moscow and a search for 
solutions to the present economic crisis in plans for the 
integration of the states of the region and/or their 
redirection--primarily toward Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and other 
countries. 
  Obviously, possibilities for the economic integration of the 
Central Asian states are extremely limited. The economies of 
these republics are more likely to duplicate than to supplement 
one another. Without outside assistance, it will be extremely 
difficult for them to emerge from their present state of crisis. 
It appears that N. Nazarbayev's persistent appeals for a new 
federation or confederation of former Soviet republics in any 
form, even an extremely abbreviated one, but with the necessary 
participation of Russia, are based on a profound awareness of 
present realities and on the recognition of the fact that 
without Russia's help, they are more likely to be doomed to a 
vegetative existence like Afghanistan's than to develop 
according to the Turkish model. If, however, the CIS continues 
to exist in its present nebulous form, sooner or later the 
states of the region are certain to establish their own 
confederation. 
  After achieving their independence, the states of Central 
Asia had to face the need to safeguard their own security. 
Turkmenistan alone has a border of almost 2,500 kilometers with 
Iran and Afghanistan and cannot defend it effectively without 
help. Tajikistan is clearly helpless against the danger of 
invasion by various gangs from neighboring troubled Afghanistan, 
and its security can only be guaranteed by collective efforts. 
Kazakhstan, the largest and strongest of these states, has a 
long border with China, and people in Alma-Ata must remember the 
earlier Chinese claims to part of Kazakhstan's territory. All of 
these circumstances dictate the need for a system of collective 
security in the region, preferably with the inclusion of 
Russia's military strength. It is not surprising that the CIS 
treaty on collective security was signed by all of the states in 
the region (with the exception of Tajikistan, which was unable 
to take part in the conference because of internal political 
difficulties) in May 1992 in Tashkent. 
  In any event, security appears to be the sphere that could 
unite Kazakhstan and the Central Asian states in some kind of 
military-political alliance. The signatories to the treaty on 
collective security might include neighboring states as well as 
CIS countries: Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, as well as the PRC 
and some others. Even the temporary presence of strategic 
nuclear forces in Kazakhstan would enhance the role of all of 
the Central Asian states in the regional system of collective 
security. 
  The consolidation of the democratic government in Moscow 
could be a factor contributing to regional integration. 
Democratic and fundamentalist ideas seem equally dangerous to 
people in the Central Asian capitals. The members of the earlier 
communist elite who have a strong foothold here simply want to 
update the facade of government without losing their dominant 
position. In response to the inevitable advancement of 
democratic forces, which are most likely to have the sympathy 
and support of Moscow, the leaders of the states in the region 
might launch collective efforts to defend their own 
pro-communist orders (Kyrgyzstan might be the only exception, 
but it does not define the policy line in the region). 
  As far as the future patterns of integration by the Central 
Asian states are concerned, the specific forms of unification 
probably will be influenced less by their relations with Russia 
than by their relations with each other. The existing conflicts 
and differences between the states of the region suggest that 
most of their leaders will not be inclined to agree to a 
federation, which would subordinate their own interests to the 
interests of the group. Furthermore, a federation of Central 
Asian states would be dominated by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, 
which is unlikely to appeal to the other members. This is why an 
association based on a confederacy seems to be the most 
preferable form of integration for the majority of these states 
at this time, because it would allow them to coordinate their 
efforts for the resolution of common problems while preserving 
the effective independence of all of their leaders.

<F P=106> [Statement by Stepan Khmara, head of the UKRP and a people's </F>
deputy: "For a Strong, Independent State and a Righteous Regime"] 
  [Text] On 18 January a conference of the labor 
collective at the Lvov Color Television Plant (RYASNE) nominated 
Stepan Khmara, head of the UKRP [Ukrainian Conservative 
Republican Party], as a candidate for the office of people's 
deputy from the Zaliznichnyy Election District No 261 in the 
city of Lvov. 
  He states as his goal a strong, independent Ukrainian 
state and a righteous regime. 
  Inability to bring order into the economy and the state, to 
safeguard it in the society, and to guarantee the legal 
protection of citizens and economic entities, mass corruption of 
the state structures, the venality, impotence, and incapacity of 
the highest state officials to protect and defend Ukraine's 
national interests--all these factors have become the cause of 
the all-encompassing crisis in our society. They also constitute 
a threat to its destabilization as well as the principal 
obstacle on the path of building an independent, united 
Ukrainian state. 
  Catastrophe can be averted provided that we make a 
fundamental change in the government. New persons must take over 
the direction of our state--persons who will carry out a policy 
based on new principles: The Ukrainian national idea must become 
the optimal need for Ukraine, for its present-day and future 
ideology as a state policy. The bearers of such a policy must be 
patriots, fanatically devoted to Ukraine and its people. They 
must be prepared to make self-sacrifices in the name of this 
great and noble idea--for the good of our Fatherland. They must 
be heroes who are capable of carrying out this noble mission. 
And there are such high-caliber, professionally competent 
Ukrainian patriots in Ukraine. It is only when such persons with 
strong willpower take over the leadership of this state that we 
will be able to count on a clean-up of the power structures from 
the botched efforts of elements characterized by a lack of 
talent, responsibility, or even decency. These people must be 
replaced by persons with an innate sense of order, Ukrainian 
patriotism, and professionalism. What is at issue here is the 
speficific mechanism for solving the principal political 
problem--the problem of govermental power. 
  In the situation which has evolved nowadays in Ukraine, it 
must be noted that we should form a standard, competent 
government--one which would be able to create the conditions for 
overcoming the crisis and to guarantee the security of the 
state; such a government would also clear away a path to a 
suitable place for Ukraine in the world. But to do this merely 
by the parliamentary path through elections has already become 
impossible for the following reasons: 
  --the optimal time for elections has already been lost; 
  --at a time of such a profound economic and social crisis, 
chaos, and anarchy it is difficult to hope for an objective 
choice by our citizens; 
  --the criminalization of various branches and levels of the 
government and the economy affords us grounds for asserting that 
our state is being led by organized criminals--persons who would 
certainly have a decisive influence on the preparation and 
results of elections; 
  --an incorrect sequence in the elections would not help to 
create better conditions for conducting them. It would be more 
feasible to carry out elections and a reform of the 
representative and executive organs of local power while 
simultaneously conducting a referendum on the matter of 
confidence or no confidence in the president; 
  --the usurpation of such important mass media as radio and 
television by the president and his team--along with the 
spreading of disinformation--has been instrumental in forming a 
distorted public opinion. Masked anti-Ukrainian propaganda has 
reached unsafe levels for the Ukrainian nation and state; 
  --an endeavor is being made to fill out Ukraine's political 
spectrum with powerful, mafia-type groups camouflaged as 
political parties. Such groups have very large finances at their 
disposal, and they have real power; 
  --the ruinous activity of the president and the 
government--directed at intensively plundering our national 
resources by various domestic and foreign mafia-type groups--has 
become so dangerous that it threatens Ukraine with the loss of 
state sovereignty, and it requires that urgent measures be taken 
for the purpose of removing the president and the government 
from power and holding them responsible for crimes committed 
against Ukraine. 
  Unless this is done in the very near future, events will 
develop to Ukraine's disadvantage. Such events could take the 
following variant courses: 
  --the dictatorship of the mafia-type groups could finally 
come about under the guise of the presidential power structures; 
  --further aggravation of living conditions could provoke a 
social outburst--one which could take the form of a spontaneous, 
uncontrolled revolt with multi-variant, extremely negative 
consequences. 
  Recent events have been nudging us toward changing the 
government by the revolutionary path. If we fail to take 
advantage of this moment, we will lose a great and very 
propitious chance to give rebirth to the Ukrainian state. And we 
are sure that such an opportunity will not be repeated, for the 
Ukrainian nation has become too weakened, and its foes will do 
everything in their power to make sure that this state will be 
finished after this failure. 
  The complete surrender of our nuclear weapons in compliance 
with the demands made by Russian and American imperialism 
constitutes a capitulation and abandonment of our state 
independence without any opposition or even objection. Without 
its nuclear weapons Ukraine will lack that restraining factor 
which is now our sole guarantee of national security. The 
imperialist predators will not have to take a non-nuclear 
Ukraine into consideration, and they will be able to act as they 
please, without taking Ukraine's national interests into account 
at all. At that time nothing will stop them any longer from 
applying any measures they choose--including the skillful 
introduction of internal instability--for the purpose of 
dismembering Ukraine and forever assigning to it the status of a 
colony without any rights. 
  Nor was the time for Ukraine's unilateral and complete 
disarmament chosen merely by chance. It was a time when the 
primary attention of political groups was keyed to the 
elections, and--on the other hand--the people were brought to 
the extremes of exhaustion by the artificially created, 
intolerable social conditions. The criminal clique of the 
anti-state, mafia-type nomenklatura resorted to a terrible state 
crime in order to preserve its own social domination, relying on 
the support of Russian and American imperialism--which acts in a 
coordinated collusion against Ukraine. There can be nothing more 
degrading for the Ukrainian nation that what Kravchuk did on 12 
and 14 January. 
  Therefore, this culminating moment cannot be allowed to 
pass. 
Kravchuk and his henchmen must be removed from power and 
punished. There are certainly legal grounds for this. In the 
first place, he acted in contradiction to the decisions. 
  In the second place, the mood in the society is not on his 
side. 
  In the third place, while Russia is still in a weakened 
condition, it will not be able to mount sufficient opposition 
should Ukraine not wish to kneel down before it. 
  In the fourth place, Ukraine's resistance to the imperialist 
desires will evoke a renewal of anti-imperialist opposition in 
other regions of the former USSR. 
  In the fifth place, attempts to blockade Ukraine will not 
find support in the world as a whole. 
  As to nuclear weapons, Ukraine is capable of maintaining 
them 
in a safe technical condition, and--within a rather brief 
interval of time and with a relatively modest expenditure of 
money--to develop them and take them under complete control and 
administer them by its own national means. Standing in the way 
of this is the highest state-political leadership, which is 
creating very great problems--and not only in the sphere of 
nuclear weapons. It is consciously sabotaging the process of 
creating a Ukrainian state. 
  The task of the national-patriotic forces is to direct the 
revolutionary process into the channel necessary for Ukraine: to 
replace the mafia-type, nomenklatura, anti-Ukrainian government 
with a national-patriotic, decent, and decent one. 
  The revolution could take place in an instant if the central 
government were to be replaced, or it could be done 
gradually--by way of replacing the regional governments and thus 
constricting the area controlled by the central, mafia-type 
regime and increasing the pressure on it until the latter is 
finally removed. 
  The central leadership of the UKRP is prepared to propose a 
personnel makeup for a Committee of National Assistance (KNP), 
which could subsequently form a complete government. 
  The UKRP is categorically opposed to the proposed candidacy 
of Lanovoy for the post of head of government inasmuch as this 
could bring about unjustifiable losses to Ukraine's national 
interests. 
  On the overall state scale the UKRP advocates the 
resignation 
of the president and the government and their being held 
responsible for committing crimes against Ukraine. It is also in 
favor of eliminating the presidential power structures. 
  As to the situation in the Lvov region, the UKRP considers 
that the principal cause of the crisis-type situation here is 
the oblast leadership. Objective conditions in the Lvov region 
are favorable for this area to become a model for all Ukraine in 
the state-creating processes, but the oblast's talentless and 
disorderly leaders are blocking this. Therefore, the UKRP must 
initiate organizational and activist measures for the purpose of 
removing from power--first of all--the following persons: 
Shpitser, the mayor of Lvov; Davymukha, the president's 
representative in this oblast; Horyn, the head of the Oblast 
Council; and Kotyk, the oblast-level procurator. 
  The UKRP will actively participate in the election campaign, 
but without restricting its struggle to existing conditions. On 
the contrary, it intends to actively influence the formulation 
of sociopolitical thought in the direction needed by Ukraine. 
  The UKRP will actively support not only candidates from its 
own organization, but also others, assessing each one as to how 
they measure up to the following criteria: a love of order, 
Ukrainian patriotism, and professionalism--first of all, 
political--and evidence of the quality of willpower. 
  The UKRP will vigorously oppose candidates from the 
pro-communist and pro-imperialist organizations, as well as 
puppets of the mafia-type groups. 
  As an organization of active, rather than paper-type, 
Ukrainian nationalists, the UKRP will evaluate candidates--first 
of all--by their deeds.

<H5>  1. Interesting Geography </H5>
  A map can be a wonderful thing. Different color intensities 
can be used to show the depths of seas, while different colors 
can be used to display the geographical disposition of various 
nationalities. But we lack one map! One that would depict the 
economic balance sheet of the various areas of Ukraine, i.e., 
which areas are operating at a profit and which are a drain on 
the Ukrainian economy. The Crimean peninsula clearly falls into 
the latter category. 
<H5>  2. A Cause of Discord </H5>
  It is only natural that for a person who is conscious of 
being a Ukrainian the Crimean question does not exist. What 
exists is the universally accepted principle of inviolability of 
borders. But the peculiar nature of our northern neighbor does 
not allow her to concentrate on her own problems and 
decrepitude, which she regards as trivial, but to fixate with 
maniacal persistence on Sevastopil, "The City of Russian Glory!" 
But this is just one of a number of fixations. For example, what 
about Port Arthur? St. Gotthard ("The Zenith of Russian Fame!") 
and, finally, Auzterlitz ("the village of Russian humiliation")? 
  To get things in perspective let us briefly recapitulate 
some 
facts on Crimea without recourse to boring statistics. 
  Crimea is a former Soviet health resort with tremendous 
recreational resources, numerous sanatoria and state-owned 
dachas for which the major and minor members of the Moscow 
nomenklatura have developed such a strong sense of longing. 
Nevermind the largely deplorable service--by international 
standards, of course--which could satisfy only a Soviet hick, 
and the huge investments that would be required for upkeep and 
improvements. 
  Agriculture in Crimea has some promise, provided enough 
water 
is supplied by the Dnieper, despite having been ruined by the 
collective farm mentality that still pervades all of the 
post-communist territories. Its enough to mention the recent 
destruction of unique vineyards there because of the predominant 
culture of inebriation to give a feeling of what we mean. 
  Retirees accounted for a higher percentage of the Crimean 
population than elsewhere in the former USSR, reaching 61 
percent in Sevastopil alone. 
  And, finally, Crimea has the Tatar Question and one of the 
most popular fleets in the world, existing solely for the 
purpose of lining the pockets of corrupt admirals and 
businessmen. 
<H5>  3. The Homeless Fleet </H5>
  For many years the Black Sea Fleet served as "powerful 
protector of the peaceful Soviet people against the treacherous 
intrusions of world imperialism" at the southern frontiers of 
the former superstate. It allegedly served a similar function in 
the Mediterranean Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean--wherever world 
imperialism posed a threat. The fact that Turkey and NATO could 
block the Bosphorus and the Dardenelles and bottle up the fleet 
went unmentioned. After all, the coddled sons of highly-placed 
bureaucrats and admirals couldn't risk their delicate organisms 
in the Arctic Ocean or the northern reaches of the Pacific, but 
still they had to mark time somewhere. And then the superstate 
fell apart, imaginary treacherous imperialistic intrusions 
disappeared, and all that was left to protect was the status quo 
with all of its perks, economic benefits, advantages and rich 
rewards. The orphan fleet was left with two fathers who compete 
for the "right" to take care of it just to look good, while not 
assuming any serious responsibilities. All the Yaltas, 
Massandras, St. Andrew's standards and Russian vouchers will 
change nothing. The fleet will age, turn to rust, disintegrate 
and the sailors will go home. The officers will make out somehow 
with other occupations and, besides, Russia still has many 
fleets with job openings. 
<H5>  4. Nothing New Under the Sun </H5>
  Having shed a tear for the sad fate of the Black Sea Fleet, 
let's look at some appropriate precedents as English jurists are 
wont to do. 
  After Salazar's death the first thing the Portuguese 
parliament did was get rid of their colonial burden to stop 
Portugal's financial exsanguination. Mozambique and Angola were 
set free to swim or sink. 
  Another example. Puerto Rico has been an autonomous 
territory 
of the US since 1917 and its politicians have tried on numerous 
occasions to gain statehood, but have always encountered 
congressional opposition. In distinction to Hawaii, statehood 
for Puerto Rico could derail the American national budget. 
Nevertheless, the island remains effectively under American 
economic control thanks to tourism. 
<H5>  5. Status Quo </H5>
  As part of Ukraine Crimea gets water, electricity, and food, 
along with financing of the fleet and the retirements of vast 
number of military retirees. Still, the Ukrainian status is 
unacceptable to them. There is longing for the good old days of 
unlimited privileges, a time when the Ukrainian "Banderites" 
knew their place, all these feelings compounded by geriatric 
hostility to change. Maybe, just maybe, there are guilty 
feelings for taking over the empty houses of deported Tatars 
with their gardens and flower fields. What if the Tatars come 
and say "Give it back!"? The empire would never have even 
tolerated such a possibility. 
<H5>  6. Necrophilia </H5>
  Present-day Russia--where you can no longer tell who is a 
genuine ethnic Russian (Russkiy) and who merely a non-Russian 
resident of Russia (Rossiyanin)--is shocked to have her 
stiffling embrace repelled in the name of self-determination. 
But she still loves her prodigal son--Crimea. This tender 
example of Oedipus complex comes up against economic realities. 
Yes, Russia is big (so far), but it also has big problems and 
does it need yet another enclave? And if the Kuban region 
settled by ethnic Ukrainians decamps from Russia, Russia--or 
what's left of it--will be even farther away from Crimea. 
  Ukraine could stand to gain financially from the Crimean 
situation. In addition to oil prices, which for Ukraine exceed 
the so-called world prices, Ukraine could charge Crimea for 
water from the Dnieper at the going rate of some four billion 
dollars, as well as for transits right across its territory to 
Crimea. Failure to pay will make more water available for 
Ukraine, improve the ecologic situation in the Dnieper basin, 
and take care of dearth of water in Southern Ukraine. The health 
resorts will continue to thrive on people with convertible 
currencies, so any referendum to remove the Crimean appendix may 
not be such a bad idea! 
<H5>  7. A New Hong Kong </H5>
  The Russian writer Aksenov raised hopes of a horn-of-plenty 
with his fictional work The Island of Crimea, which is easy 
enough to do with Homo Sovieticus. 
  But, in fundamental terms, there is only one solid basis for 
self-determination in the world, and that is the will of the 
indigenous population. In a conglomerate country you are up 
against a situation where the spiders at the center of the web 
order everyone else around. In Crimea you simply cannot ignore 
an Islamic (Tatar) factor, jihads, and so forth. Yet the allure 
of foreign investments and the creation of another Hong Kong is 
quite appealing as an easy solution to a rather unsettling 
reality. 
  How are the pensioners going to be supported? From rental 
fees for Sevatopil if anybody wants to rent the port? Ukraine 
would be better off keeping its compact fleet elsewhere. What 
about water? Energy? Food supplies? But those will be the 
problems of an independent Crimea and not Ukraine and, of 
course, we can assume that the separatists have anticipated and 
provided for these facts of life. 
  A final thought. The waters surrounding Hong Kong have been 
become so polluted as to render them unfit for swimming; just 
something else to think about. 
  To date, the Ukrainian community has been remarkably passive 
in all this and it voice disproportionately low-keyed in this 
international sing-song. The work of such organizations as 
"Crimea with Ukraine" and the regional centers of political 
parties--which have been rendered largely meaningless by the 
passage of the Crimean constitution--are, nevertheless, slowly 
permeating into the Ukrainian consciousness. Ukrainian passivity 
is to a large extent due to an information blockade posed by 
absence of Ukrainian schools and exclusion of the Ukrainian 
language from the mass media and community organizations. In the 
face of this, the persistent efforts of the Tatars are worthy of 
admiration. 
<H5>  8. Two Suitors and a Girl </H5>
  Christ often spoke in parables, which might offer a 
convenient vehicle to address the Crimean issue. 
  Once upon a time there was once a clever girl who encouraged 
two suitors, counting on getting gifts and attention from both 
of them. Things got heated between the rivals, but the wiser one 
came to his senses, realized what the score was, and took off. 
The girl panicked and attempted to lock-in on the remaining 
suitor, who came to think that she might not be such a treasure 
after all if no one else would have her. The upshot is that her 
intrigues risk making her lonely for life. 
  This brings to mind a Russian anecdote where a husband 
holding his wife out of a tenth-floor window tells her how lucky 
she is [in Russian]: My grandfather stabbed his wife, my dad 
shot his, and I'm letting you go free! 
  This has obviously been an anecdotal and a light-humored 
look 
at the Crimean question, but every bit of humor has a particle 
of truth in it...

<F P=106> [Article by Prof. Volodymyr Lapin, Doctor of Economics, </F>
chief advisor to the Ukraine President representative for 
economic issues in Odessa Oblast: "Does the President Have Any 
Power?: Ruslan Bodelan Dreams of Communism in an Independent 
Bodelan Kingdom"] 
  [Text] It is no secret for anyone in Odessa Oblast that the 
majority of deputies in the Odessa Oblast Council, chaired by 
former CPSU-CPU Secretary Ruslan Bodelan, have been for two 
years ardently championing the resuscitation of the single 
inviolate USSR. What causes concern, however, is an initiative 
that has emerged lately from the bowels of the oblast council 
bureaucracy: "an experiment to broaden regional economic 
independence." 
  To implement this experiment in accordance with its concept, 
approved by the decision of the oblast council, the state must 
delegate to Odessa a share of its legal and economic rights. 
These include operational control over the region's economy, the 
building of infrastructure and investment of foreign and 
domestic capital in the oblast "to open it up to the world 
market." How about that? Who cares about Ukraine or the 
Ukrainian people? Every man for himself. 
  When words such as region and oblast are stripped from the 
oblast council resolution, the aspirations of Odessa 
independence-seekers toward the so-called free economic zone 
become clear. In paragraphs mandating the establishment at the 
regional level of special regimes for foreign business and 
export-oriented activities and regulating the registration of 
foreign company offices, control over the compliance by the 
participants in foreign business activities with Ukrainian laws 
and conditions of international agreements, taxation of business 
entities and licensing of their business activities a large part 
of Ukrainian law will be suspended for the duration of the 
Bodelan experiment. 
  Thus, we are talking of regional statehood or, at least, 
autonomy. Apparently they are expecting heaven on earth in 
Bodelan's Odessa, once the free special economic zone has been 
established. It is a strange tug-of-war. So far, no one in Kiev, 
the seat of Ukrainian statehood, has asked: "What kind of 
kingdom is the head of the oblast council trying to carve for 
himself?" Instead, there is talk that the resolution should be 
examined by the Cabinet of Ministers, that the legislative 
groundwork for the establishment of such a zone needs to be 
done, including detailed technical and economic characteristics, 
even sectoral orientation; blueprints for the development of 
industrial and social infrastructures; economic and research 
potential; levels, sources and forms of financing; price and tax 
regimes; systems of foreign exchange, financial, credit and 
tariff regulations, etc. 
  One can imagine the diligence and rigor of the analysis of 
all these points, including from the point of view of economic 
security of Ukraine, while the documents pass through the 
appropriate bureaucratic channels. It is a wonder than serious 
people, patriots of independent Ukraine (if they are patriots), 
have nothing else to do. Moreover, the Odessa advocates of 
Soviet Power have chosen to get there through the back door, by 
hoping to go around the law. They claim that this is only a 
special, temporary experiment. We know how the Crimea has been 
experimenting: it has already elected its own president. 
  Do we not exaggerate the dangers of the Odessa experiment? 
Let me try to analyze its essence. Free economic zones are part 
of a national policy, the main goal of which is for the country 
to gain foreign investment, obtain new technology and increase 
the intake of foreign currency for the state budget. This is why 
the state offers special incentives on taxes, tariffs, 
insurance, credits, foreign exchange, prices, etc. at its free 
zones. The state often limits union activity in such zones, the 
right to strike and even the application of minimum wage laws. 
Naturally, in such conditions, elements of social pressure 
inside the zone may increase and, as world experience shows, 
present the danger of an explosion. 
  One other thing provides cause for concern: who it is that 
tries to abrogate the rights of the state to establish a free 
economic zone. Let us recall that in the past three years the 
Odessa supporters of the USSR and socialism have undertaken a 
number of actions the clear goal of which was the territorial 
dismemberment of Ukraine and the loss of its independence. In 
the fall of 1990, as is well-known, the bureau of the Odessa 
CPSU-CPU obkom organized a rally by South Ukrainian workers at 
the walls of the Supreme Council under the main slogan: Unless 
the Union agreement is signed, the Black Sea region will secede 
from Ukraine. A year later, in Odessa, they staged a joint 
session of the presidiums of three South Ukrainian oblast 
councils and the Crimean Autonomous Republic to set up the 
legislative framework for the South Ukrainian Assembly. Finally, 
as all efforts failed, the last trump card was put into play: 
"The Ukrainian economy can be saved from collapse only by an 
economic union with the CIS." And, since the CIS also stumbled, 
they discovered the Odessa economic and legal experiment, the 
goal of which is, in essence, to ignore legislative acts of 
Ukraine on its territory. 
  Of course, a free zone itself could be successful and could 
benefit the entire nation, but only if all of its structures 
function within strictly defined limits of the existing 
legislation and, necessarily, under the control of the supreme 
organs of state power in Ukraine. 
  The same can be said about attempts by the Odessa Oblast 
council to assume the right to manage the national property. 
This includes not only major industrial enterprises but also 
transport and energy-producing entities, ports, electric 
transmission lines and highways--all that is indispensable for 
the normal functioning of a country. If all this is given up to 
the oblast council, the question arises what will happen to such 
economically important entities as the Odessa port plant and 
refinery, the steam ship company and the pipelines. Will they 
become the material foundation of the Odessa Republic? 
  If we want to speak seriously of broadening economic 
independence at the local level and implementing oblast-level 
programs and projects, they are currently being developed in the 
Odessa region. For instance, there are plans for the structural 
rebuilding of the machine building complex in the oblast, and 
for the support and development of entrepreneurship. The oblast 
executive authorities patiently work to implement them. But the 
input by the oblast council in this important area cannot be 
seen through the magnifying glass. Please, work on these issues. 
But no. 
  Time has come to develop and implement the general program 
for the support and development of the farming movement in the 
oblast, and for the long-term development of inter-farm ties at 
the oblast level in Ukraine as well as with the nearby regions 
of the near abroad. This is what oblast deputies should 
primarily focus their attention on, and not on empty populist 
slogans and calls for the creation of a new Union. By the way, 
if they could implement the idea of inter-oblast cooperation 
with regions of the near abroad, the very issue of the new Union 
would have fallen away immediately. In this respect, positive 
experience already exists in Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and some 
other Ukraine oblast. 
  It would have been praiseworthy if the oblast council, 
instead of engaging in the tiresome talk about the 
impoverishment of workers, had developed clear ways of providing 
direct aid to socially unprotected and poor citizens, and 
instead of debating the shortage of heavy fuel and other fuels 
had drafted a program for saving energy and using alternative 
fuels, for instance those obtained from wastes at agricultural 
processing plants. There are also other issues that are very 
important for the oblast. 
  But the leaders of the oblast council and its chief have no 
time for this. They have contracted an autonomy fever. 
  Analyzing the actions of the Odessa Oblast Council and its 
decisions one becomes convinced that the very system of 
communist soviets is destructive. Thank God, there are 
precedents of how to do without them. This is how small states 
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia live, and, in all likelihood, this 
is how a great state, Russia, is going to live. We alone (except 
for North Korea and Cuba) are ahead of the entire planet, 
bolstering this historical atavism. I think that it is time for 
us to switch to a system of municipalities, prefectures and 
mayors, which efficiently function everywhere in the world on a 
professional basis and do not wave around their red banners 
which have long ago become discredited. One would wish that the 
president of Ukraine, like Yeltsin with respect of Sverdlov's 
creation, acted more decisively and directed his representatives 
to do likewise.

<F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Pylypchuk, member of the Presidium </F>
of the Supreme Council and chairman of the Commission on 
Economic Reform and Management of the National Economy, by 
Myroslav Levytskyy; place and date not given: "Volodymyr 
Pylypchuk: `We Are Quite Capable of Reforming Our Economy' 
"--first two paragraphs are ZA VILNU UKRAYINU introduction] 
  [Text] Below we publish some observations on the current 
state of Ukraine's economy and on ways to resolve the crisis 
offered by Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a leading Ukrainian economist, 
member of the Presidium of the Supreme Council, and chairman of 
the Council's Commission on Economic Reform and Management of 
the National Economy. In 1992 Volodymyr Pylypchuk was elected 
deputy chairman of the Economic Committee of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of NBSYe [[expansion not given]. Since the first day of 
Ukraine's political independence, he has consistently called for 
securing Ukraine's economic independence through radical 
economic reforms. 
  Today Volodymyr Pylypchuk is also involved in coordinating 
the training of free-market economists to take the place of 
officials currently in office following the 27 March election. 
  [Levytskyy] A great deal has already been said about the 
state of the Ukrainian economy. Unfortunately, skeptical and 
negativistic views prevail. Some politicians have gone so far as 
to "predict" how much longer our independent state will survive. 
I have asked you to give me this interview because you belong to 
that circle of people who continue to believe in economic 
reforms and envisage great prospects for Ukraine as a prosperous 
state. 
  [Pylypchuk] We all need a healthy dose of optimism. If we 
accept the opposite notion, that "everything is heading towards 
the end, towards collapse," we are still left with the question: 
and what then? What should we tell people to do--head for the 
cemetery?.. 
  If we view our problems from a philosophical vantage point, 
we know that every decline is followed by a rise. It is assured 
by people who know what needs to be done and how to do it. The 
Commission on Economic Reform and Management of the National 
Economy has a conception for overcoming the crisis, a program 
for halting inflation, conducting accelerated privatization, 
developing a market infrastructure, stabilizing the economy, and 
introducing a monetary unit. 
  The first thing we need to do is halt inflation. But to do 
so, we have to eliminate the budget deficit. Our program calls 
for revoking all tax benefits except those granted to 
organizations of invalids, who are unable to compete with 
able-bodied people. We must change the tax base and switch to 
taxing turnover or sales volumes. It is also important to lower 
taxes. This will cause the business activity index to rise and 
ultimately replenish the budget. Business enterprise will expand 
and firms that have registered where taxes are lower will return 
to Ukraine. 
  Our program envisages conducting privatization and receiving 
a portion of the earnings from this. This will result in 
reducing the expenditure side of the budget because the state 
will stop financing private organizations. As a consequence of 
this policy, branch ministries, committees, concerns, and their 
local organs will be eliminated. The third important element in 
reducing budget expenditures is to decrease spending on the 
upkeep of the armed forces. Ukraine currently maintains a rather 
large army. This army must be transformed into a professional 
force and then made smaller and more efficient. 
  Inasmuch as Ukraine has a negative foreign trade balance, we 
have worked out a mechanism for eliminating the deficit in 
foreign trade. This can be achieved by increasing exports, which 
is also linked with privatization. Privatization is the only 
thing that can serve as an incentive for work, an incentive to 
increase output and improve production quality. It is also 
necessary to revoke export licenses and lower import duties. To 
prevent exports from being sold at dumping prices, we must 
introduce economic regulation. 
  To overcome the current crisis, it is important to convert 
and reconvert the military-industrial complex and sell weapons. 
The whole world trades in arms in compliance with the 
regulations established by the world community. 
  [Levytskyy] An important element in Ukrainian reforms must 
be 
decreasing imports. What do we need to do to achieve this? 
  [Pylypchuk] We need to recooperate the national economy to 
enable us to produce domestically the goods that are now being 
imported from abroad. It is also essential for us to allow the 
sale of facilities producing unfinished production by tender (on 
condition that products that are in short supply in Ukraine are 
manufactured here). To restrict nonvital imports, we need to 
pursue a wise isolationist policy and focus on buying raw 
materials and high technologies. The state must renounce 
conducting trade. Private businessmen will maintain the proper 
balance--that is, they will buy only as much as they can afford 
for the money they earn from sales. In addition, we must 
intensify our search for minerals, especially fuel resources, 
and pump deeper for oil and gas on existing fields. 
  [Levytskyy] In a market economy, there must be a balance 
between the supply of goods and the supply of money. Is this 
difficult to achieve with the kind of disequilibrium in the 
economy that we are currently experiencing? 
  [Pylypchuk] In order to balance the supplies of goods and 
money, we must treat land, factories, and plants as goods, 
prohibit the issue of credit if there are no goods and financing 
when the balance is in the red, as well as the sale of reserve 
funds by the National Bank in the form of credits. 
  [Levytskyy] Representatives of government structures often 
stress that the crisis is the result of objective 
circumstances--of the fact that the structure of the Ukrainian 
economy is so tied to Moscow. How much of today's crisis is 
caused by postimperial objective conditions and how much by 
officialdom's subjective actions? 
  [Pylypchuk] If someone needs to explain the reason for 
failure, he will always find an excuse. The easiest way is to 
blame external factors. No one denies that these exist, but one 
must always look to oneself for the cause. Today's situation is 
the result of a failure to implement reforms, of pursuing a 
zigzagging and inconsistent economic policy. 
  [Levytskyy] One frequently hears that Ukraine has lost her 
chance. I disagree with the skeptics, but will it take our 
country a very long time to make its way out of this crisis? 
  [Pylypchuk] We are quite capable of reforming our economy. 
There are methods and mechanisms that would allow us to do so 
rapidly. Ukraine's potential is sufficient to halt production 
decline in 1994 and begin building up the national economy. All 
we need is the will and a new way of thinking. 
  [Levytskyy] Representatives of government structures have 
another excuse for their failures: the price of energy supplies 
has increased 10,000-fold since 1990. Their opponents say that 
in 1990, a metric ton of oil cost 10 cents, which is not true. 
Can you explain this discrepancy? 
  [Pylypchuk] This is both true and false. I recall that 
before 
the crisis, a metric ton of Russian oil cost 12 dollars. Today's 
price is eight times as great. But the multiplying effect has 
also comes into play. When the costs of raw materials rise, 
these costs are multiplied in processing, in the production of 
Group A products, Group B products, and in the retail trade. The 
law of multiplication is in operation, as in calculating the 
gross social product. On top of this, there are internal factors 
of inflation. 
  The external factor in inflation could have been 
neutralized. 
We sold Russia a certain amount of metal, grain, and meat. A 
wise government should have made an agreement: we will sell you 
a package of goods, but if your price rises, ours will rise 
accordingly. Then the price shock would not have been as strong. 
But some in our government did not know or understand this, 
while others were openly working to collapse Ukraine's economy. 
  Let me just say that the situation in Ukraine is quite 
different from that in the former countries of the socialist 
bloc. For example, Poland has a monolithic society, which never 
wanted to be part of the empire. There is a segment of our 
society that is very fond of the empire and looks back on it 
with nostalgia. Fortunately, time is on our side. People are 
beginning to understand that a drowning man's hope of salvation 
lies solely in himself. 
  [Levytskyy] You mentioned nostalgia. Journalists have 
learned 
that Yu. Zvyahilskyy has agreed to transfer a portion of our 
industrial projects to Russia in exchange for our debts. What 
can you tell us about this contract, and how are such problems 
resolved elsewhere in the world? 
  [Pylypchuk] The general rule is that loans are secured by 
property. If they are not paid back, this security goes into 
effect and the property is put on the block. Unfortunately, I do 
not have all the documents that Zvyahilskyy signed, and so I 
cannot draw a firm conclusion regarding this action. I would 
like to assure you that Ukraine would be able to engage in trade 
without incurring debts with all countries if the state would 
hand over the conduct of trade to businessmen. The state should 
have no say in what anyone should buy, at what price, with whom 
to break ties and with whom to establish ties. Businessmen will 
do a much better job of it. Government structures have proved 
totally incapable of directing new processes. 
  [Levytskyy] A conflict broke out in December between the 
National Bank and the commercial banks. National Bank officials 
assure journalists that had it not been for the National Bank's 
timely intervention, the commercial banks would have paralized 
the financial system. The heads of commercial banks charge V. 
Yushchenko with incompetence and are demanding his resignation. 
The arguments put forward by both sides appear persuasive to 
nonspecialists. Which side is right? 
  [Pylypchuk] There is more truth in what the commercial banks 
say. Although they, too, are not without sin, because they hold 
up the funds of their clients for a time and use them as if this 
money were their own. This happens because the National Bank 
does not perform the functions with which it has been charged. 
There is a decree in force in Ukraine, under which accounts that 
are settled late are subject to taxes and a fine. The National 
Bank is unable to control this and therefore takes steps that do 
not serve the interests of the banking system as a whole, let 
alone the specific situation in which Ukraine currently finds 
itself. Prohibiting banks to advance credit can be compared to 
prohibiting stores to sell goods. This is absurd... 
  [Levytskyy] Until recently, the so-called money changers 
used 
to buy up convertible currency at every intersection. For the 
last two weeks, we have been witnessing the reverse in Kiev. 
They are trying to sell currency. What has caused this abrupt 
change? 
  [Pylypchuk] This phenomenon is linked with the banking 
system. As long as the National Bank advanced credits that were 
not backed by resources, many people tried to save their money 
in hard currency. When the Supreme Council prohibited the 
National Bank from issuing money unbacked by resources, the 
exchange rate came to a halt. Insofar as winter is a passive 
season in agriculture, the National Bank's position will be firm 
and consistent. When the production sphere is activated, the 
dollar exhange rate will drop. Some people understand this and 
hope to exchange their hard currency at the highest possible 
rate. Secondly, the process of privatization has begun. 
Enterprises are selling their stock. Those with dollars are 
investing their capital in property. 
  [Levytskyy] Is it true that 29 Russian banks are operating 
in 
Ukraine at this time, and if so, what impact do they have on our 
economy? 
  [Pylypchuk] There are branches of Russian banks in Ukraine. 
Opening branches of foreign banks is a universal practice, 
because their funds benefit the country in which they are 
located. Under inflationary conditions, however, there is a 
danger that the profits from conducting hard currency auctions 
do not benefit the Ukrainian economy, that they do not remain in 
Ukraine. 
  [Levytskyy] You frequently meet with economists from abroad. 
How well do they understand Ukrainian problems? I am 
particularly interesting in how well these are understood in 
Poland. According to reports from Warsaw, Poland's foreign 
policy towards the east is changing to reflect a greater 
emphasis on Russia. 
  [Pylypchuk] Since I am not only an economist but also a 
politician, I do not wish to make any comments about what is 
happening in Poland. But I want to stress that it is necessary 
to take a sober look at who has come to power in Russia and on 
what platforms. Poland was a part of the empire which 
Zhirinovsky is planning to restore. The conduct of some 
politicians reminds me of the rabbit that places its head into 
the mouth of a serpent. 
  [Levytskyy] What benefits did Ukraine derive from its 
membership in the CIS? What is your attitude to the idea put 
forward by the national-democratic forces of Ukraine that a 
qualitatively new entity should replace the CIS--the 
Baltic-Black Sea Community? 
  [Pylypchuk] I am among those who support the creation of a 
Baltic-Black Sea Assembly. Above all, because of the military 
doctrine of the Russian Federation, which wants to interfere in 
the internal affairs of independent states, in interstate 
relations, and to settle conflicts with the help of its armed 
forces. The aggressive policies of the USSR have not 
disappeared. They have been passed on, along with many other 
things, to Russia. Today, this policy is being proclaimed 
openly. The countries that lie between the Baltic and Black sea 
need to understand that if Russia succeeds in swallowing up 
Ukraine, one of them will be next. 
  [Levytskyy] Especially in light of the fact that as Radio 
Liberty has reported, Russian diplomats are now resorting to a 
new tactic: "If you do not give us a peacemaking mandate and 
credits, Zhirinovskyy will simply take them." 
  [Pylypchuk] There are forces whom Zhirinovsky wants to 
swallow up in Russia itself and in other countries who 
understand that such a policy will lead to a conflict that will 
shake the world. For that reason, the UN and the developed 
countries of the world should listen to the fears being voiced 
by the countries that lie between the Baltic and Black seas and 
realize that the threat is real. I am confident that they will 
adjust their attitude to the new states that have emerged on the 
territory of the former USSR and will make the granting of aid 
to the Russian Federation conditional on its rejection of 
territorial claims on its neighbors. 
  [Levytskyy] The election campaign has already started in 
Ukraine. Judging by the results of two democratic elections in 
Poland, a large number of people will cast their votes based on 
a party's attractive name or a candidate's effective speech, 
rather than on the political platform being proposed. Inasmuch 
as these elections are deemed to be especially important, what 
should voters focus their attention on? 
  [Pylypchuk] There is a rule that every people gets the kind 
of government and parliament that it deserves. If people do not 
want to stand up against it, they deserve this absurd situation. 
Sociological surveys indicate that the majority of people has 
now come to understand that the parliament and government should 
consist of professionals. I am onfident that the electorate will 
cast its votes for the reformist forces. As I said earlier, the 
democratic bloc has a program for solving the crisis and it has 
people who can accomplish this. 
  [Levytskyy] But you surely agree that far from all voters 
will bother to study the program in any depth. They will vote 
for reform, but the choice will be between two concepts: "change 
everything immediately" or "make changes that have been well 
considered and are possible to effect." 
  [Pylypchuk] There is a grain of reason in both concepts. Our 
success will also depend on the speed with which reforms are 
conducted. But we should not repeat the mistakes made by our 
neighbors. 
  [Levytskyy] The presidential campaign in the Crimea has 
entered a heated phase. The campaign has a distinctly 
anti-Ukrainian bent. People are being drawn into the pro-empire 
camp with populist slogans about cheap gas and oil. Will Ukraine 
be able to maintain her territorial integrity? 
  [Pylypchuk] Let me answer you first as an economist and then 
as a politician. From an economist's standpoint, Crimea's 
separation would be to Ukraine's advantage. Per capita income 
produced in the Crimea is lower than in Ukraine but higher than 
in Russia. Ukraine supplies the Crimea with water and 
electricity. This would leave Ukraine with 3.5 billion dollars 
of net profit annually. While the Crimea produces only some 
three percent of Ukraine's national income, it consumes 18 
percent. Hence it requires large subsidies. 
  But no state in the world gives up territory without a 
fight. 
I think that all politicians understand what a change of borders 
leads to when one of the sides does not agree to this change. 
There are already many examples of this on the territory of the 
former USSR. I do not believe that politicians will take this 
route. When a new boundary is drawn across the land of an owner 
without his consent, this land is always drenched with blood. 
Those in the Crimea who are pouring gasoline over the ground 
must be stopped, because later it will make no difference who 
throws the first match--chauvinists or nationalists! 
  [Levytskyy] Thank you for this conversation, and I hope that 
there will be no new boundaries in Ukraine and no blood! 
  [Pylypchuk] I hope so too. Allow me also to extend my 
Christmas greetings to your readers and wish them that troubles 
and evil pass them by and that their children bring them joy.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Savchenko, deputy head of the oblast </F>
state administration, by Vasyl Chepurnyy; place and date not 
given: "`Chernihiv Oblast's Role in Ukraine Is Like Alaska's in 
the United States'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Chepurnyy] Your words are rather harsh and unexpected. Can 
you please explain? 
  [Savchenko] I have made this comparison because, 
unfortunately, our oblast finds itself in a much worse situation 
than other oblasts. Despite the fact that, like Alaska in the 
United States, it supplies vitally needed raw materials -- 
timber, flax, and agricultural goods. Judge for yourself. 
  Our oblast is an agricultural region and so our income is 
obviously seasonal. After bringing in the harvest, we dutifully 
sell it to the state and put aside some money to buy equipment, 
fuel and lubricants, and fertilizers. But this money is 
instantly eaten up by our raging inflation. Half the population 
lives in rural areas, whereas the lack of parity in the prices 
of industrial and agricultural goods has produced a situation in 
which industrial production accounts for nearly 70 percent of 
the gross national product. Just three years ago, it amounted to 
40 percent, while agricultural output accounted for 60 percent. 
  The oblast has few hard-surface roads, schools, medical and 
preschool institutions, and cultural facilities. But our 
invariably "holey" budget, multiplied by inflation and the 
seasonal nature of agricultural production, prevents us from 
rising to the level of other oblasts. The budget is also weak 
due to a bias in setting the rates of excise taxes, enterprise 
taxes, and value-added taxes. 
  In accordance with the "Law on the State Budget of Ukraine 
for 1993," our oblast kept only 23.1 percent of the value-added 
tax and 50 percent of the excise taxes and enterprise profits 
tax collected on its territory. Meanwhile, Zhytomyr, Sumy, and 
Kiev oblasts received the full amount. We, on the other hand, 
have been put in the same category with Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, 
and Zaporizhzhya oblasts, all of which have a powerful 
production potential. 
  As a result, our level of social development lags 
significantly behind average indicators for Ukraine as a whole. 
For example, while the national average of apartments equipped 
with gas is 46.6 percent, only 28.9 percent of Chernihiv 
Oblast's apartments have gas. The number of physicians per 
10,000 residents is 44 percent nationally and 31 percent in 
Chernihiv [as published], the number of children provided with 
permanent preschool institutions -- 49.4 and 48 percent, 
respectively. The list of examples could go on and on. 
  In the past, as we know, there were state orders for both 
agricultural and industrial production. There was a relatively 
firm arrangement: we gave the state potatoes, flax, grain, etc., 
and the state provided us with industrial goods, equipment, fuel 
and lubricants, fertilizers, and consumer goods. Moreover, at 
stable and more or less affordable prices. Not once did we fail 
to execute the state order! Now they take from us, but give us 
nothing in return. What we have now is something skewed, 
something that is no longer even a state order, but simply a way 
of pumping out agricultural production. 
  We are trying to develop our processing industry to involve 
a 
higher degree of processing, but this requires lumber, meat, 
butter, sugar, grain alcohol, and hides. The oblast has all of 
these things and moreover in large amounts. But the state order 
takes everything. 
  [Chepurnyy] Your economic service prepared a study that 
clearly shows that in terms of per capita national income 
Chernihiv Oblast has surpassed such powerful oblasts as Luhansk, 
Donetsk, and the Crimean Republic. This is simply hard to 
believe. 
  [Savchenko] It is hard to believe because the miners are 
creating an uproar across the entire country, even though their 
demands are harming not only the economy of the whole country 
but also the residents of Donetsk Oblast by driving up inflation 
with their high wages. The Crimea is snuggling up to Russia and 
also making a fuss. Whereas our oblast is very docile--except 
for the famous slogan, "Who ate my meat?" during the notorious 
"sausage revolution," we have not been heard from in the 
political chorus. 
  he result has been that Luhansk Oblast, for example, 
receives 
327,000 karbovantsi per resident in financing from the state 
budget, while Chernihiv Oblast gets only 251,000. Even Poltava 
and Zhytomyr oblasts receive 275,000 and 295,000, respectively. 
Other oblasts receive subsidies from Kiev, while all we get are 
promises. 
  [Chepurnyy] The solution, presumably, does not lie in 
stretching out your hand to the state and saying: "Give!"? 
  [Savchenko] Of course not. There should be normal economic 
relations in our dealings with the center and with other 
oblasts. What has happened instead is that we cannot collect 
what is owed us for the meat, butter, and other agricultural 
goods that we delivered in government orders to Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine's southern oblasts. 
  I have said on many occasions that the Donetsk miners do not 
travel to the Kuzbas to get coal for their homes, schools, and 
enterprises. They burn the coal they mine. Why is it then that 
we, Chernihivites, must give up all the oil that we pump in the 
southern part of our oblast and then have to go looking over 
hill and dale for what we need ourselves? And, moreover, have to 
overpay insane prices for it. And, moreover, have our 
environment polluted by the development of oil and gas fields. 
That is why the oblast state administration requested that at 
least 20 percent of the oil be left in the oblast to meet local 
needs. We went from one high office to another and managed to 
get all of five percent. Clearly, this amount is not sufficient 
for our needs. Nonetheless, the State Committee on Oil and Gas 
found an excuse to reduce our already meager shipments. They are 
sweeping our forests clean to obtain timber for mines, but our 
oblast gets no preferential terms when buying coal. Right now 
the Chernihiv Thermal Electric Power Station has only 30 percent 
of the coal it needs. 
  Let me add a few words about sugar and grain alcohol 
[spirt]. 
We need these as much for purposes of forced barter as for our 
own consumption. I say forced because you need five times as 
much fuel to grow potatoes and flax as you do to grow grain 
crops. Thus we have a senseless situation. They take our oil 
while we have to go looking for foreign oil in order grow 
potatoes and flax for Ukraine. Or is it that our country no 
longer needs these things? 
  [Chepurnyy] Incidentally, statistics indicate that Donetsk 
Oblast owes us huge sums of money for meat and butter. 
Apparently we are feeding the miners free of charge to enable 
them to strike on a full stomach and in comfort? 
  [Savchenko] The trouble is that Chernihiv Oblast itself 
needs 
assistance as a region that suffered from the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. Nor is it only a matter of Chernobyl. We also 
require special treatment because Chernihiv Oblast is where the 
process of depopulation in Ukraine began at the beginning of the 
seventies--in other words, the death rate exceeded the birth 
rate. 
  [Chepurnyy] Let us return to your comparison of Chenihiv 
Oblast to Alaska... 
  [Savchenko] We are not demanding special treatment; we need 
to be treated normally. To begin with, those governing 
structures that decide he fate of the people must adhere to 
economic laws and take into consideration the peculiarities of 
socioeconomic development of both industrial and agrarian 
regions. Otherwise it will be quite a while yet before we 
achieve the standard of living that even the Eskimos in Alaska 
enjoy.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Pyrozhenko, candidate of geographical </F>
sciences: "Where Are We Living Today?"] 
  [Text] There are problems with the safe use and renewal of 
forest resources. 
  A geographic approach has to be taken in formulating 
ecologically and economically sensible concepts for forest 
management since it encompasses the entire complex of economic, 
social and ecological issues at hand. 
  Ukrainian forests are subject to intrusive anthropogenic 
factors in heavily industrialized areas with large power plants. 
The extensive forests in the zone of the Chernobyl nuclear 
accident and adjacent territories of the Kiev, Zhytomyr, 
Chernihiv, Rivne and Volyn oblasts differ as to type and 
functional designation and the degree of radioactive 
contamination. On the average, forests take up 27.3% of 
the 
land area, a figure that reachers 36% in the 30 km 
Chernobyl 
zone. This represents 2.4 million hectares, or 38.4% of 
the 
forest lands of Ukraine. Artificial reforestations accounts for 
50.3% of the area in those regions, versus an average of 
68% 
for Ukraine as a whole. Coniferous forests predominates 
(63.0%), followed by hardwood forests (17.5%). 
Most (48.5%) 
are young and mid-age (37.5%) growths. Cesium-137 is the 
most 
widespread contaminant of the three major radionuclides (cesium, 
strontium, plutonium); however, in the 30 km Chernobyl zone 
strontium-90 and plutonium are the dominant contaminants. 
  Utililization of these forests for timber and recreation and 
their levels of radioactive pollution is depicted in Fig. 1. The 
map shows that the forests can be classified into eight types: 
1--Conservation and recreation; 2--Conservation and timberland; 
3--As category 2 in combination with radiomonitoring; 4--As 3, 
but with moderate commercial use; 5--As 3 but with low level 
commercial exploitation; 6--Conservation and limited commercial 
exploitation; 7--Conservation with radiomonitoring; and 
8--Conservation and protected against commercial use. 
  Forests that predominate in the Kiev Oblast--which suffered 
the most from the Chernobyl fallout--fall mainly into categories 
7 and 1. The primary categories in Zhytomyr Oblast are 3, in 
Chernihiv Oblast 2 and 3, in Rivne Oblast 3 and in Volyn Oblast 
2. The most contaminated forests to which access is forbidden 
are found in the Chernobyl and Polissya forest preserves in the 
Kiev Oblast, and in the Narodnytskyy, Ovrutskyy and 
Slovechanskyy preserves in Zhytomyr Oblast. This classification 
does not include forests in the 30 km zome or the dead 'brown 
forest' there. 
  This for of classification may make it possible to include 
the radiopolluted forests in the timber economy. For example, in 
the Kiev Oblast 14.0% of the forest areas have economic 
(including recreational) value, 66.0% have limited 
potential 
with mandatory radiomonitoring, and 20.0% (excluding the 
30 km 
forbidden zone) are out of bounds for any type of use. The 
corresponding figures for the Zhytomyr Oblast are 4.5, 75.2 and 
37.3%, in the Chernihiv Oblast 37.3 and 62.7%, in 
the Rivne 
area 9.7 and 90.3%, and in Volyn Oblast 52.2 and 
42.8%. In 
terms of economic potential the last three oblast are in the 
most unfavorable position, although even they have undergone 
changes in the way their forests are categorized. 
  Constant efforts are required to maintain and renew the 
forest resources where radioactivity ranges from 1.1 to 5.5 
Ci/sq. km. and higher. These efforts are hampered by poor 
working and living conditions, particularly where tree husbandry 
is concerned, and danger of radioactivity. Both factors 
contribute to a shortage of labor. Forestry workers--especially 
loggers--have been shown to receive 1.5- to 2.5-fold as much 
irradiation as other segments of the population. Accordingly, 
such work must be curtailed on territories where radioactivities 
exceed 10 Ci/sq. km., and the work force must be further reduced 
by employing tree planting machines that have already been 
approved for use in the 30 km zone. 
  In summary, the forestry industry must be carefully 
reassessed and nurtured in the Kiev, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, Rivne 
and Volyn oblasts. Full utilization of these resources must be 
based on the above classification and economic impact 
projections of the Chernobyl accident.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Lavrynovych, deputy head, Ukrainian </F>
People's Movement (Rukh): "Privatization Is the Key to a Change 
in the Behavior of Economic Factors"] 
  [Text] The present-day situation in Ukraine's economic life 
has created a status of general dissatisfaction and--here and 
there--even of despair. What lesson can we draw from the first 
two years of Ukrainian state sovereignty? Nowadays it is surely 
obvious to everyone that there will be no perect economic 
solution to the problem of extricating ourselves from this 
all-encompassing crisis. 
  We need to solve the problem of making a systemic transition 
to a new quality of society, state administration, and economics. 
  One gets the impression more and more nowadays that the 
situation is being pushed--whether consciously or not--in the 
direction of extraordinary measures. There is a persistent 
argument to the effect that the escalation of the 
above-mentioned crisis is being brought about by Ukraine's 
energy dependence, as well as by the constant rise in prices 
spent for energy-bearing materials. But the proportion of such 
energy sources in Ukraine's credit indebtedness is less than 15 
percent. And what about the remainder? The rest of this 
indebtedness is caused by the noncompetiveness of Ukrainian 
goods in the markets of other states and by the fact that we 
have a tight taxation, customs-duty, and import-export policy. 
The real cause of our worsening situation lies in the absence of 
reforms and consistent actions in the field of managing the 
economy. 
  Our economy cannot be rebuilt without an all-encompassing 
change in the structure of property rights. And it is groundless 
to anticipate changes in the behavior of economic factors 
without privatization. It has never happened anywhere and surely 
never will. Having set out on the path of reform, we must 
organize a rapid and mass privatization. The goal of 
privatization is to find new property-owners and managers and to 
channel the funds obtained into the appropriate solution of 
social problems. 
  We are taking the initial steps of our reform policy in the 
agro-industrial complex. And we are beginning with land reform. 
Ukraine's agriculture requires various forms of management and 
various forms of property ownership. At present the process of 
privatizing land and making a total farm inventory on a 
shareholding basis is urgent. We must ensure that there are 
state monitoring controls on land utilization. The goal of 
privatizing land and property is to reform collective farms into 
full-valued cooperatives, shareholding enterprises, private-type 
farms, and associations of village-owned farms. 
  The question of prices and price formation is 
extraordinarily 
important and--at the same time--painful. The present-day 
government in Ukraine, having abandoned the path of direct 
administrative command, has not set forth on the path of 
market-type changes, but instead has chosen the path of the 
absurd. What else can one call a course directed at reducing the 
Gross National Product, curtailing production, and precipitously 
impoverishing the population, while--at the same time--creating 
the conditions for superprofits and enriching state bureaucrats 
by means of bribery, extortion, and other such mercenary 
behavior. 
  The first step in this field must be to ensure that there 
are 
public monitoring controls by citizens on the utilization of the 
state budget. This step has to be taken in order to prevent the 
budget from being plundered in the form of granting privileged 
credits, subsidies, and budgetary loans. 
  We need to legislatively reinforce evenhanded tax conditions 
for enterprises under all forms of property ownership. In order 
to encourage investments and stimulate the entrepreneurial 
spirit, we should introduce "flat" taxes on profits. This is a 
very important step--one which could encourage, first and 
foremost, the active influx of medium-sized and large-scale 
international capital. In parallel fashion, we have to adopt and 
apply progressive taxes for individual incomes. 
  While creating favorable conditions for business 
activity--conditions which will enable us to realize high 
profits--we must also ensure protection for sensitive social 
groups by providing targeted aid and relief for them. We are 
introducing into our Rukh program precise ways and means for 
implementing such protective institutions. 
  It is a known fact that the success of the economic reform 
depends--to a considerable extent--on cooperation between state 
and private property owners. Pushing on forward is only possible 
if we begin real privatization, including that of land. This 
would enable us to put a stop to the plundering of state 
property and free the state from the need to subsidize 
enterprises making low profits or even operating at a loss. 
Privatization would also mean the end of uncontrolled credit 
issuance, inasmuch as the granting of credits to state 
enterprises is the principal source of the deficit today. 
  In order to expand the possibilities for Ukraine's citizens 
and to create evenhanded conditions in the obtaining of credits, 
we must legislatively reinforce the right to grant credits to 
those citizens who wish to start up their own businesses or to 
acquire housing. 
  We also need to create favorable conditions for the 
emergence 
of new private enterprises and to implement programs for 
supporting and developing entrepreneurship. We have such a 
specific program. Each person desiring to become an 
owner-manager will be allowed to participate directly in the 
administration of the economic region involved. And, therefore, 
we must carry out not only small-scale privatization, but also 
provide for the joint-stock ownership of corporate-type 
enterprises. The creation of a private sector will be 
accompanied by mandatory anti-monopoly measures, which will 
simultaneously provide equal rights among enterprises having 
various forms of property ownership. An interest in--and concern 
for--turning out competitive goods or services needed in the 
marketplace will facilitate the growth of social production. 
Privatization will have to cut back on the production of 
energy-consuming, noncompetitive machiner and semifinished 
goods; and it must expand the sphere of producing consumer 
goods. We already need to tackle the structural change of energy 
production in Ukraine now so as to reduce the imports of oil and 
gas to a minimum. 
  All these measures are possible only if the problem of 
government power is solved. Otherwise, the decline in the 
economy will continue even more precipitously. Therefore, we are 
in favor of combining our efforts with those of all Ukrainian 
patriots and supporters of rapid, radical reforms. We have faith 
in our success, and we anticipate that the path to it will not 
be too long and painful.

NEZAVISIMOST economic observer, and Valentin Likhodey, candidate 
of economic sciences and docent of Kiev University imeni T.G. 
Shevchenko: "Do Not Sleep: Think About SPI! Elimination of 
Illiteracy-94"] 
  [Text] SPI means property privatization certificate 
(a different word order would lead to an abbreviation that would 
be not quite so euphonious). SPI is the Ukrainian voucher whose 
distinguishing feature is that it can be neither seen nor felt 
nor sold at a bazaar. It is the right to participate in 
privatization or, more precisely--a noncash means of payment for 
acquiring certain shares. 
  A certain confusion is already arising here. The 
advertising is being presented in a form that implies that by 
investing your SPI somewhere your shares will make you a real 
owner of some enterprise. But in reality the owner is the 
joint-stock company and the individual investor has only the 
right to vote at the general stockholder meeting (practically a 
formality) and the right to part of the joint-stock company's 
income, that is, a dividend. You cannot take back the money you 
invested in the joint-stock company. You can only sell your 
shares if, of course, you can find a buyer for them. The 
certificate itself, therefore, should be called not a 
privatization certificate but an investment certificate. 
  In order to utilize his SPI a citizen of Ukraine must, first 
of all, select an object of privatization, that is, find an 
enterprise that has announced the sale of its stocks for 
privatization certificates. And here it is important to 
emphasize at the outset that two scenarios are possible: The 
first involves direct purchase of a state enterprise for 
collected privatization funds, after which it is transformed 
into a joint-stock company; the second involves preliminary 
formation of a corporation out of the enterprise, whereby it is 
transformed into a state joint-stock company (that is, a 
joint-stock company with predominant participation of state 
capital) which would like to sell its shares for SPI's. 
  While with the first version it is still possible to speak 
about participation in privatization (the SPI investors actually 
play the role of cofounders of the joint-stock company), with 
the second the change in the form of ownership occurs 
independently of the investors. And this ownership itself turns 
out to be quite curious: On the one hand a small group of 
managers of the former state enterprise declare the private 
nature of their joint-stock company and recruit individual 
investors; on the other--the company elite dispose of state 
capital according to their own will and demand economic support 
from the state at the same time. As a series of scandals has 
shown, in the distribution of income both the investor and the 
state are taken for a ride. According to the instructions of the 
State Property Fund of Ukraine, after selecting an object of 
privatization the citizen fills out an application for acquiring 
shares which (pay special attention to this) is addressed to the 
commission for sale of shares of the given joint-stock company. 
And if you do not fulfill this condition and then end up 
deceived, you have only yourself to blame. It is necessary to 
speak about this because we already see the practice whereby 
joint-stock companies create subsidiary intermediary firms which 
enter along with the citizens into transactions involving the 
sale of shares in the parent company for SPI's. (In order to 
distinguish the subsidiary enterprise from the parent one, pay 
attention to their full title, only a certain part of which they 
share in common.) And it is almost probable that in the 
undisclosed regulations of the subsidiary firms a special 
stipulation is made concerning the absence of mutual liability 
for obligations of the subsidiary and parent enterprises. With 
all the possibilities that ensue from this in our times of 
highway robbery. 
  After filling out the application for acquiring shares you 
receive a privatization payment instruction (PPP), which is the 
basis for using the SPI. After obtaining the PPP you go to the 
central rayon savings bank where your name should already be on 
the lists compiled in the place of residence. A privatization 
deposit account (PDS) is opened for you, in which the sum of 
1.05 million karbovantsy are deposited (stand still you precious 
moment!) and from which it is now transferred to the recipient 
indicated on the PPP. 
  The sum of 1.05 million karbovantsy was arrived at as a 
result of a 35-fold indexation of the initial amount of the SPI 
of 30,000 karbovantsy established in May 1992 prices. And the 
sum of 30,000 karbovantsy was determined (approximately) as 
152-millionths of the value (restored) of state property subject 
to transfer to the population free of charge. On the whole this 
value was estimated at 1.52 trillion karbovantsy and then, 
according to the Privatization Program, the proportion of 
nonstate property was to increase over three years from 4 to 46 
percent. 
  And here we come to the most interesting thing. It is all a 
matter of the fact that in May 1992 the exchange rate of the 
dollar fluctuated in the range of 115-135 karbovantsy per 
dollar. Consequently, one SPI could be valued at more than $200. 
But today, when you purchase shares for your SPI and then sell 
them and obtain cash, the cost of the SPI ends up to be less 
than $30. A sevenfold difference appeared because the nominal 
value of the SPI was indexed 35-fold while the exchange rate of 
the dollar has increased almost 300-fold during the time that 
has passed, and prices--even more. 
  Hence it follows that if the real share of state property 
subject to privatization free of charge remains the same, the 
nominal value of the SPI today has been reduced many times over 
as compared to May 1992. Therefore if the SPI's enter the sphere 
of circulation in one form or another, their price as 
representatives of the actually existing material wealth should 
grow in correspondence to the level of prices of other 
constituent parts of society's wealth--goods, services, 
securities, and currencies that are on the market and mutually 
exchangeable. 
  All this means that the million plus that was deposited into 
your PDS and transferred out of it in keeping with a special 
payment is by no means the same thing as a million coupons in 
your pocket. The special nature of the privatization funds 
remains even in the hands of their recipients, which is attested 
to by the accumulated PPP's. In particular, there is still the 
possibility of further transferring the privatization funds and 
using them to purchase state property whose value has been 
clearly reduced. This is why it is convenient to have subsidiary 
intermediary firms and this is why, like the investment funds in 
Russia, trust companies are being created in our society (trust 
and holding companies) which will themselves distribute the 
SPI's, paying you dividends under various conditions. But if the 
trust companies take on certain obligations, the intermediaries 
who sold you the shares have the right to dispose of the SPI's 
at their own discretion and in their own interests. 
  Consequently, you must have a clear idea of precisely what 
you will receive in exchange for your SPI, and this is important 
even when filling out the application. From the preceding it is 
clear that it is by no means a matter of indifference whether 
you receive in exchange shares that are already being sold on 
the market or those that are being emitted (issued) for the 
first time. In the former case you are using your privatization 
million precisely as if you were spending cash money. In the 
latter case you can count on the fact that with relatively 
reasonable management of affairs in the joint-stock company in 
which you have become an investor, in time the rate of its 
shares will increase several-fold as compared to the nominal 
rate which is determined on the basis of a reduced assessment of 
the value of the fixed capital. 
  It is worth noting that for the owner of shares their price 
quotation is even more important than dividends since during a 
year it can grow much more and when selling the shares the 
shareholder can receive appreciable net income. This is the 
tendency that prevails in countries of the West which, of 
course, does not lead to mass sale of shares since the 
shareholders are expecting their quotation price to increase in 
the future as well. Therefore when buying shares the selection 
frequently depends on an assessment of the expected growth of 
their price quotation. 
  But in order to make a correct choice it is necessary to 
have 
the most diverse information, which our compatriots do not have. 
Moreover, there are always random factors that determine the 
relationship between supply and demand and, hence, also both the 
level of dividends and the level of the price quotations for the 
shares. 
  For example, it is natural to want to invest your SPI's 
close 
to home so you can have more information about the object of 
privatization. But the structure of the location of the 
population does not coincide with the regional structure of the 
value of privatized property. On the other hand, today many 
people are ready to use their SPI's while only a small 
proportion of the facilities for privatization have actually 
been included in the process of the formation of joint-stock 
companies. Just as by the end of the three-year period 
calculated for the privatization program many facilities, on the 
contrary, will not be available for purchase because of a lack 
of free privatization funds. 
  And many issues remain unclear. Thus the nominal sum of the 
initially emitted shares must be equal to the value of the 
purchased fixed capital and therefore surpluses of privatization 
funds received at one enterprise or another will signify a 
reduction of the nominal value of the package of shares issued 
in exchange for one SPI. Will the prospect of modernizing 
production with additional privatization funds compensate for 
this reduction? Which is more advantageous--to use your SPI's 
now or wait for an increase in the number of facilities that are 
actually being privatized? What will happen to the SPI's that 
are invested in facilities that have not collected a sufficient 
sum of funds for purchase? 
  In addition to these questions one can already see signs of 
growing confusion in the means of obtaining shares for SPI's. 
Anyone who has thoughtfully followed our economic history since 
the times of perestroyka will undoubtedly agree that it will be 
impossible to get through without mass cheating. But here 
everyone will have to decide for himself. This is not the first 
and probably not the last time we will be granted an opportunity 
to play the role of monetary capitalists, and therefore one 
person's fiasco will not arouse sympathy in the rest. 
Incidentally, let us not forget that life--and especially the 
buying and selling of shares--is a game.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Semenyuk, Minister of Power Engineering </F>
and Electrification, Ukraine, by L. Brovchenko: "Paradoxical 
Situation: Industry Must Struggle to Reduce Its Income"] 
  [Text] Everyone is concerned about the energy situation, 
and everyone feels the energy crunch. Even television broadcasts 
had to be curtailed, resulting in a dearth of information in 
addition to low building temperatures and other forms of 
distress. These facts formed the topic of our conversation with 
V. Semenyuk, Minister of Energy and Electrification of Ukraine. 
  [Semenyuk] The situation is very complicated. Our current 
receipts of fuel--coal, heavy oil, and gas--are running 20 
percent below last year's. In other words, we are short 40 
billion kilowatt-hours (bKw-h) because of inadequate fuel 
supplies. Problems with heavy oil and gas--which we get from 
abroad--are particularly grave. Coal deliveries by the Ukrainian 
coal miners are more-or-less normal at 100-115 thousand tons a 
day, but we burn 150-160 thousand tons every day. The difference 
comes from our reserves, which in better years amounted to ten 
to 11 million tons. Last year we managed to save eight million 
tons of coal. At this rate of consumption our reserves of coal 
will last for another month or so. 
  [Brovchenko] But the winter will last longer than that ... 
  [Semenyuk] There's more! Some power stations have already 
run 
out of coal or have only one or two day's supply. Stations that 
produce heat in addition to electricity have first claim on 
coal. In short, if the coal industry will produce at the present 
level, then we can last until February. As far as coal goes, we 
are optimistic since its used to produced 27-28 percent of our 
electricity. Since one third of the electricity comes from 
nuclear power plants, it helps that the parliament lifted the 
moratorium on the Chernobyl plant which supplies 1.2 to 1.3 
bKw-h per month. So far this winter it has produced 8 bKw-h of 
electricity, which otherwise would have required four million 
tons of coal. 
  In addition, gas deliveries fell by six billion cubic meters 
this year. The year before last by December we had consumed 
80-82 million cubic meters, and a year ago 56-56.5 million cubic 
meters. 
  But the worst scenario pertains to heavy oil deliveries 
which 
are 15-20 percent below normal. We have only emergency reserves 
left, leaving unused some 40 percent of the equipment at thermal 
power stations. The situation is particularly bad at the 
Burshtyn, Ladyzhan, Trypillya, and Vuhlehirsk plants, followed 
by Prydniprovsk and Kryvyy Rih stations. 
  [Brovchenko] People are using electric heaters and gas 
stoves 
at home and at work for heat, which defeats the entire purpose 
of conserving our energy resources. What's to be done? 
  [Semenyuk] True. As a result of the overload some one 
thousand transformer substations have been damaged in November. 
We haven't been able to repair them yet because of electricity 
is so cheap--cheaper than energy derived from coal and gas. 
Everywhere else household electricity costs 1.5 to twice as much 
as that made available for industrial use and people are less 
inclined to waste it. Currently, we have established a rate of 
90 karbovantsi (krb) for 75 KW-h of electricity for household 
use. Using any more will cost you 180 krb at cost-recovery 
rates. With 16 million households, it is impossible to monitor 
everybody's use, and everything depends on a sense of 
responsibility and integrity of the consumers. 
  [Brovchenko] That's somewhat utopian. We just got through 
building a communist society which was to be based on a high 
sense of responsibility of the citizens and found out that it 
doesn't work. 
  [Semenyuk] True. We should provide assistance for the poorer 
segments of the population and charge the wealthier elements a 
higher rate in order to control energy use. However, a proposal 
in this vein was not supported by the Council of Ministers. 
  [Brovchenko] So, your industry is short about 20 percent of 
the fuel it needs to meet the demand for electricity. Will some 
limits be placed on the use of electricity by consumers? 
  [Semenyuk] We will try to avoid this. We will also try to 
exclude the fuel industry, community and agricultural 
facilities, as well as processing, baking, meat and the dairy 
industries. 
  Machine engineering, chemical and metallurgical industries 
may be cut back by 40-50 percent. 
  [Brovchenko] What will altering the work schedules give you? 
  [Semenyuk] Reduce peak demands for electricity, although 
overall consumption will remain the same. 
  [Brovchenko] And what about television stations? 
  [Semenyuk] Curtailing their use saves 3.6 million Kw-h per 
day, or almost 80 million Kw-h per month, which is equivalent to 
40 thousand tons of coal a month. If had enough fuel 
broadcasting hours would not have been curtailed. 
  [Brovchenko] Its a paradoxical situation. Your profits 
increase with increased usage of electricity and yet you have to 
advocate less consumption. 
  [Semenyuk] Unfortunately, that's the case. We cannot 
stockpile what we produce and production and consumption have to 
balance. That's why we count so much on a sense of 
responsibility of the population because of our problems with 
fuel supplies. 
  We could buy fuel from commercial suppliers, but that 
requires money. Our consumers owe us three billion karbovantsi. 
  [Brovchenko] How much electricity is produced by hydropower 
stations? 
  [Semenyuk] The output of Ukrainian hydropower stations is 
4.7 
million kW-h per year; gas-powered stations produce 4-5 percent 
of our electricity. A third is produced by nuclear power 
stations and 66 percent by thermal plants. 
  [Brovchenko] Still, do you lean to optimism or pessimism? 
  [Semenyuk] I think we'll survive the winter.

Sciences: "Unemployment: Who Will Miss the Boat?"] 
  [Text] Some 80,000 unemployed were registered in 
Ukraine at the end of 1993. According to data from the state 
employment service, 337 enterprises are currently at the verge 
of bankruptcy, and if they are shut down more than 70,000 
additional workers will become unemployed. This data does not 
take into account the so-called hidden unemployment, which is 
evident at hundreds of enterprises around the country. 
  The problem has come to the fore. Without delay, we 
must seek ways to alleviate it and help those who missed to boat 
to adjust socially. Society must carry out natural selection to 
ensure that the most able and qualified employees have jobs at 
various sectors of the economy. 
  The Ukraine State Committee on the Coal Industry has 
selected 
the first batch of 21 mines for a weeding--i.e., a test of 
economic viability. The collectives were given targets for 
raising productivity and cutting costs in coal production this 
year. If they fail to meet these targets, they will be shut down. 
  Thus, unemployment among mine workers is becoming reality 
and 
requires appropriate organizational preparation. 
  A technological lag in the Ukrainian coal industry has led 
to 
the existence of many unprofitable mines and caused excess 
employment. Calculated on the basis of unit of energy per 
employee, other countries have long ago stopped using labor so 
uneconomically. The need for coal forces the state to support 
loss-making enterprises and meet miners' demand for wage 
increases. The pressure from miners on management sometimes 
exceeds that of the administrative command system itself. 
Miners' victories have several times pushed the country to the 
brink of hopelessness, since the growth of salaries did not 
produce appropriate increases in output. Large-scale subsidies 
encouraged social parasitism and became reflected in a general 
worsening of the economic situation. 
  Today, the country finds itself on the brink of a social 
cataclysm. Ukraine President L.Kravchuk put the problem as 
follows: we will either perish or find the means and the 
strength to save Ukraine. One of the main means for salvation is 
to solve the fuel and energy crisis. In this sector, coal has 
become the main resource of the country, since local production 
of gas covers only 22 percent of the country's needs and oil 
just 8 percent. This is why the stabilization and development of 
the coal industry has assumed vital importance. We need coal as 
much as we need bread. But this bread can no longer be purchased 
at the old price: otherwise, coal will become the destruction of 
the country, not its hope. This will clearly require a sharp 
change of the practices and outlook on employment that exist in 
the industry. 
  The outline for the development of the industry to 2005 
states that layoffs in the industry will primarily be effected 
by closing down mines after their coal deposits become 
exhausted. It is also possible that some layoffs will stem from 
market processes, which may lead to the reduction of output and 
even closure of some mines. 
  According to calculations, the layoff process will 
accelerate 
from 1996 and will continue to 2005. But, evidently, the current 
catastrophic situation in the country's economy requires that 
the process of weeding out unhealthy enterprises begin sooner. 
  Layoffs and retraining of employees for jobs in other 
industries is a normal process which accompanies the development 
of production. But in the coal industry it has been hampered by 
miners' demands that jobs be preserved. One leader of the 
Donbass strike committees called job reductions an attempt by 
the government to "squeeze miners out of the pits." The State 
Committee on the Coal Industry felt that it had plenty of 
time--as pointed out earlier, job cuts in the industry were not 
planned to start before 1996--and did not address the issue 
closely. This was, apparently, also the reason why it turned 
down the proposal from the Ministry of Labor to draft jointly an 
employment program for the industry. Nor did it support the 
proposal to establish a special center under its auspices to 
coordinate the work and provide normative and methodological 
guidance to enterprises, so that they could use their labor 
resources more efficiently. 
  Especially important in solving today's employment problems 
is to select able employees, analyze changing employment trends 
within industries and identify retraining needs. Experience has 
shown that a sociological analysis of employee qualifications 
contributes to success. When supplemental paragraphs for the 
agreement on pay rates and labor and social guarantees between 
the State Committee on the Coal Industry and industry trade 
unions were drafted, the Committee was required to commission a 
study on this issue in the third quarter of 1993. But this 
resolution was ignored and was merely a waste of time. 
  Now, due to the decision by the government to abolish 
subsidies to loss-making enterprises, the picture is set to 
change rapidly. Business requires that the management of the 
State Committee on the Coal Industry and of industry trade 
unions urgently provide organizational support and funds for 
such studies, which will eventually produce a methodology for 
compiling social and professional classifications of workers. It 
will become a tool allowing enterprise managers and unions to 
use a consistent approach for assessing the abilities of 
different workers and for achieving social justice in the 
employment sphere.

correspondent: "Just 70 Grams Could Destroy Odessa"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Ukraine needs 40 million metric tons of oil. But this does 
not mean that it must have an oil transshipment complex near 
Odessa </H3>
  At its meeting, the tender commission considered competitive 
bids for the construction of an oil terminal (known as the oil 
transshipment complex, or NPK) in the vicinity of Odessa. A 
majority of the commission members voted in favor of the bids 
submitted by the IVM company. The complex will be able to 
receive 40 million metric tons of oil per year. The construction 
of the first stage of this complex, with a planned capacity of 
12 million metric tons, is to begin soon. But should we be in 
such a rush to begin building? 
  We will begin by examining the numbers that I consider to be 
most significant. These are official statistics. During the 
unloading process, the average amount of oil spilled into the 
sea is 70 grams per metric ton. This might seem like an 
insignificant amount. But what happens when you multiply these 
70 grams by 40,000,000 metric tons? You get 2,800 metric tons! 
After absorbing this amount, "the world's bluest" [sea] will 
turn black, disgusting, and dead. Specialists may say that I am 
wrong. According to the calculations of Professor O.H. Myronov 
(Sevastopol's Institute of the Biology of Southern Seas), the 
Black Sea is supposedly capable of cleaning up 2,600 metric tons 
on its own. This may be, but we are left with another 200 metric 
tons, which is enough to pollute the entire Odessa bay and 
Odessa's beaches (one cubic meter of oil, spreading as film, 
covers ten square kilometers). This will start a chain reaction: 
it will disturb the balance of the "water area -- atmosphere" 
system, producing unexpected changes in climate and the mass 
destruction of phytoplankton (in other words, the "lungs" of the 
sea). There is more. Mollusks [rachky-chervyachky?] will die, 
fish will die of hunger and lack of oxygen. And no new fish will 
breed, because their eggs will have been destroyed even earlier. 
We will not be the only ones affected. The Black Sea will be 
completely devoid of fish and all living organisms, because the 
Odessa valley [balka] accounts for 70 percent of the total 
bioproductivity of the Black Sea. It acts as a kind of birthing 
home for 60 percent of all the fish in the Black Sea. 
  And what about human health? Those who have managed to catch 
such fish and eat it now lie hospitalized in cancer wards. The 
toxic components of oil can accumulate in huge quantities in 
fish. 
  Nor can we ignore the possibility of technical mishaps. 
Consider an accident along the 25-mile-long pipeline, an 
accident involving the equipment used to receive the oil. 
Finally, an accident involving an oil tanker. 
  et us get back to statistics, which indicate that the number 
of such accidents is growing with each year. In 1986 there was 
only one accident that produced a large oil spill; in 1987 there 
were five, in 1988 -- 21, and in 1989--39!. The sea in the 
vicinity of Odessa resembles Derybasivska Street in Odessa 
itself. But the most that a collision between two pedestrians on 
Derybasivska Street can result in is an exchange of juicy 
invective, whereas a collision at sea in which a tanker hits 
something will spell tragedy for thousands, perhaps millions, of 
people. Supporters of the terminal respond to concerns about the 
threat of pollution to the sea by saying: we will call in the 
oil clean-up vessels and they will remove everything. But the 
director of the State Inspectorate for the Protection of the 
Black Sea, S.K. Dolynskyy, is much more pessimistic on the 
subject: it is possible to remove only 10 percent of the oil 
that has been spilled. 
  Moreover, should one of our tankers "splatter" oil near some 
foreign shores, we will have to pay huge fines and compensation 
for serious losses. Not surprisingly, Turkey announced its 
unwillingness to allow our tankers to pass through its straits. 
The risk of collision in these narrow sea corridors rises 
manifold. It appears, therefore, that in our attempt to free 
ourselves of dependence on Moscow, we will end up just as 
dependent on Turkey. Just like in the old days, when our hapless 
hetmans sought the sultan's support against the tsar or the 
tsar's against the sultan. It will be a sad day if, after 
spending huge sums of money on this project, we will be unable 
to use it because of our southern neighbor. Now that I have 
broached the subject of politics, let me cast some light on the 
situation with respect to the terminal from the political 
standpoint. The point of the project is primarily political: to 
make Ukraine independent of Russia. This means that either our 
politicians and diplomats are unable to live in harmony with our 
neighbors, or that this eighbor is an out-and-out villain. At 
this point, we should mention another argument that is made in 
support of the terminal. Russia's oil production is supposedly 
dropping and there will nothing left for us to buy. Perhaps that 
is so. But so far Russia is pumping oil to us. And even if we 
have to pay for it in hard currency, I, as a politician, do not 
much care to whom we pay this money--Iran or Russia. As an 
ecologist, however, I am in favor of dealing with Russia, 
because this will allow us to protect our benevolent sea from 
oil. 
  And so, let us return to ecology. If we must ship in oil by 
sea, what can we do to reduce the danger? In the first place, 
the tankers should be unloaded in a closed port. The oil port 
that has long been operating in dessa already has the capacity 
to take in 4 million metric tons. Following reconstruction that 
will take two weeks, it will be able to receive 8 million, and 
after another six weeks, 12 million. Exactly the same amount 
that the first stage of the future terminal is designed to 
receive. In other words, we can receive the same amount of oil 
but spend a lot less money if we opt for reconstruction. In 
addition, this will be safer, because in the event that 
"something happens," up to 90 percent of the spilled oil can be 
removed in the closed area of the port, and the rest will 
pollute only the port. The personnel of the Odessa port 
submitted its proposals to all the institutions concerned, but 
for some reason no one was interested. Could it be because they 
would have to travel to Odessa to negotiate this matter rather 
than to England? 
  Another way to prevent accidents is to reduce the tonnage of 
oil tankers. Instead of the planned tankers with a capacity of 
100,000-150,000 metric tons, we need tankers that will hold 
one-third as much. Such vessels can be built at our own 
shipyards--in Kerch, Kherson, and Mykolayiv. But for some 
reason, Ukraine is placing orders for its tankers in the Federal 
Republic of Germany instead. Our countrymen are left jobless. 
The Ukrainian government is planning to feed German 
shipbuilders. Why? It is up to the Security Service to determine 
the reason. At the same time, it should assess this whole 
project from the standpoint of security. The terminal can prove 
a tasty morsel for terrorists--homegrown and foreign alike. Put 
the sea portion of the terminal out of service and the whole 
country is left without "black blood." The shore facilities are 
even more inviting--they stand next to the Odessa port plant 
[pryportovyy zavod]. In addition, the burning oil will produce 
clouds of ammonia, which will transform Odessa into a cemetery 
within hours. Our military has considerable experience in the 
operation of terminals. If the need is really so great, it makes 
more sense to use the existing terminals of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Conversion in action! But perhaps we need not involve either the 
Security Service or the Defense Ministry? We have, after all, a 
Ministry of Environmental Protection! They are the ones who 
should be sounding the alarm. Unfortunately, however, this 
ministry is silent. And when it does speak up, it does so at 
little more than a whisper. In talking with me, Minister Yuriy 
Kostenko agreed that 40 million metric tons through a single 
facility is too much. "This is contrary to the National Security 
Program, which I helped to draft," he added. Yet the ministry 
gave its approval for the construction of the first stage of the 
terminal. In doing so, it did list many reservations. But why 
agree to the project? It is not up to me to relate in detail the 
position of this ministry. I expect that UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will 
give the minister of environmental protection and other 
organizations concerned in this matter an opportunity to do so 
in future issues. But one dangerous problem remains--to devise 
the safest way of shipping in the oil. Perhaps it would be 
better to bring in some of the oil through the oil port and some 
through the Black Sea Fleet's terminal. And the rest? But then, 
is there anyone who can show concretely that today Ukraine needs 
exactly 40 million metric tons of oil? And does this figure 
include the eight million metric tons that our businessmen 
shipped abroad last year? 
  Another fact is also interesting. Some people are now citing 
a figure of 100,000-150,000 million metric tons rather than 40 
million. According to the data of this same socioecological 
alliance, in addition to the existing oil refinery in Odessa, 
plans are now being drawn up for a second refinery, closer to 
the terminal. The plans for the terminal itself include an 
outport. This facility is designed for exporting not for 
importing. Here is what it boils down to: the oil is shipped to 
us, we refine it, give 50 percent to the owner of the oil and 
keep the rest for ourselves. Plus all the smoke, dust, etc. In 
other words, we are paying with the lives of our people to solve 
the "gasoline" problem. Just like any banana republic. We will 
sell the health of our citizens, but in exchange we will be able 
to feed them so that they do not strike and do not demand early 
elections to the Supreme Council. 
  For Ukraine, oil means its existence and independence. But 
finding this oil must be left to people who are wise and who are 
patriots of the land on which their children and the children of 
their children will live after them.

  [Excerpts] On 3 February 1994 deputies finally managed to 
begin discussing President Leonid Kravchuk's proposal on 
Ukraine's annexation to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear state, and on reconciling the 
trilateral Moscow Declaration with the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council's decree of 18 February of last year regarding 
ratification of the START-I treaty. Reports on this matter were 
presented by Leonid Kravchuk and Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Anatoliy Zlenko. The president confirmed his prior statement 
that the Moscow Declaration was now one in a series of documents 
already adopted by Ukraine on the road to a nonnuclear status, 
and that it is "a political compromise by the three powers on 
the fundamental questions of nuclear disarmament." Kravchuk also 
declared that the declaration also meets the fundamental 
stipulations of the parliamentary decree. The explanation Leonid 
Kravchuk gave for the fact itself of the advent of this document 
was that Ukraine, which had not joined the Nonproliferation 
Treaty, had found itself at the brink of international isolation. 
  [Passage omitted] In the end, the necessary majority voted 
in 
favor of the Supreme Council's decree, consisting of two items. 
It is stated in the first item that with regard for the measures 
proposed by Leonid Kravchuk for implementing the parliamentary 
decree of 18 November of last year, and for the steps taken in 
response by Russia and the USA, Ukraine was "lifting the 
stipulating concerning Article 5 of the Protocol to the 
Strategic Offensive Arms Treaty, signed in Lisbon on 23 May 
1992." By the second item the Ukrainian Supreme Council charged 
the government to exchange certificates of ratification of the 
START-I treaty and to concurrently begin the work of signing 
specific agreements on the procedure and conditions of Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament, foreseen by other stipulations of the 18 
November parliamentary decree. A decision was made not to 
examine the matter of Ukraine's annexation to the 
Nonproliferation Treaty as a state not possessing nuclear 
weapons until special discussion of the text itself of the 
Nonproliferation Treaty in parliament. 
  It is now becoming obvious that on one hand Ukraine has 
taken 
yet another step in the direction of the world community on the 
road of nuclear disarmament, since it lifted its parliamentary 
stipulation concerning Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, which 
requires Ukraine's annexation to the Nonproliferation Treaty as 
a nonnuclear state. As we know, it was stated in that 
stipulation, dated 18 November of last year and designated as No 
3, that "Ukraine does not consider itself to be bound by Article 
5 of the Lisbon Protocol." But now this stipulation has been 
lifted, and Ukraine has declared its readiness to fulfill the 
Lisbon Protocol. 
  However, on one hand Ukraine is clearly in no hurry to 
exchange ratification certificates on the START-I treaty, since 
other stipulations of the said decree, which foresee the signing 
of a number of international agreements, remain in effect. Among 
them are agreements on international guarantees of Ukraine's 
national security, on the conditions of economic, financial, 
scientific and technical aid in fulfillment of the START-I 
treaty, on guaranteed servicing of Ukrainian nuclear weapons by 
Russian specialists, on reexamining the conditions of financing 
inspection activities foreseen by the said decree, on the 
possibilities for using missile silos for peaceful purposes, on 
the conditions of using weapon materials from eliminated nuclear 
weapons, and on guarantees of compensation for the material 
value of these components. In addition the stipulations 
separately require compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, 
and the signing of a special agreement on the conditions and 
priority of transfer of nuclear ammunition to Russia and on 
coordination of the schedule for this transfer. 
  In his concluding remarks Leonid Kravchuk told the deputies 
that he received a letter from Bill Clinton, who promised to 
double the amount appropriated for the destruction of Ukrainian 
missiles. It was announced that a group of experts from the USA, 
Russia and Ukraine will begin work as early as in February. They 
will determine the value of the exported tactical nuclear 
weapons, and the procedure for paying compensation to Ukraine. 
Valentin Lemesh, chairman of the deputy commission on problems 
of defense and state security, told reporters: "We have taken 
one more step, and now let them take a step in our direction, 
let them give us something else besides talk, and begin 
appropriating at least some sort of assistance." 
  The official interpretation of the adopted degree has not 
yet 
been made public, but it is clear that the decision reached by 
the deputies will have significance both to the internal 
political life of Ukraine and to the world community. In its 
opposition to executive power and the president, by collective 
effort the parliament took at least three important steps: The 
image of Leonid Kravchuk as the sole peacemaker and 
unquestioning proponent of Ukraine's nonnuclear status was 
severely shaken in the eyes of the Ukrainian public. The Supreme 
Council confirmed that blame for the current economic situation, 
which has placed Ukraine on the brink of nationwide catastrophe, 
lies not only with the parliament but also with the president, 
and ultimately it "charged" Leonid Kravchuk to do more 
concretely and more swiftly something he doesn't like very much 
and doesn't want very much, and namely, to sign international 
agreements advantageous to the country. 
  And in the international arena, by accepting the Lisbon 
Protocol the Ukrainian Supreme Council is forcing the world 
community to choose: Either go on with the policy of pressure on 
Ukraine and demand its adoption of the Nonproliferation Treaty, 
or finally start helping Ukraine materially, and offer specific 
guarantees of security.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk finally managed 
to persuade the Supreme Council to ratify the Strategic 
Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty without any stipulations. 
Ukraine thus became a nonnuclear state, and the president's 
signing of the trilateral American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement 
has been confirmed. Kravchuk is in a sense demonstrating the 
strength of his own positions to his partners at the Moscow 
summit, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. However, this 
demonstration is almost a Pyrrhic victory. 
  Opting for foreign political concessions, parliamentarians 
decided to "recoup their losses" at the expense of presidential 
power, scheduling elections of the new head of state in June and 
rescinding the power of presidential representative in the 
regions, in which authority is to be returned to the local 
councils. In contrast to representatives of the Russian 
president, who perform only representative functions, 
representatives of the Ukrainian president directly exercise all 
power in the republic's oblasts and cities. And the Ukrainian 
parliament's attempt to deprive Leonid Kravchuk of his needed 
chain of command right at the eve of parliamentary and 
presidential elections distinctly reveals the true measure of 
sympathy the parliamentary corps hold for the head of state. 
  It stands to reason that only the "party of power" can count 
on any serious success in the forthcoming parliamentary 
elections, and that only in the event of this party's victory 
can Leonid Kravchuk hope to have the new parliament call off the 
presidential elections. Or to win such elections. However, there 
is hardly any logical basis for these plans: Voters in 
post-Soviet states have been known to vote the opposition. And 
the last elections in Ukraine (in Crimea) gave the Ukrainian 
leader a good idea of how fickle the sympathies of voters are, 
and how they "love" centrists today. By the way, Leonid Kravchuk 
has been taxed by yet another ordeal--a meeting with the new 
Crimean president, Yuriy Meshkov.

<F P=106> [Article by Hennadiy Udovenko, ambassador extraordinary and </F>
plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the Republic of Poland: "Absurd 
Charges: The Position of the Ukrainian Embassy in Warsaw on the 
Case of Major A. Lysenko"] 
  [Text] On 19 January a trial began in the military court of 
the Warsaw Military District which attracted the close attention 
of the mass media not only of Poland but also of other 
countries. SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] Major Anatoliy 
Lysenko and Polish citizen Janusz Bojarski, accused of espionage 
activities against Poland, are on trial. According to the 
official version of the Polish military prosecutor's office, 
which has been carried by the mass media, Ukrainian intelligence 
officer A. Lysenko engaged in espionage activities against 
Poland and recruited J. Bojarski as a secret agent. The latter 
passed on to A. Lysenko information on so-called "white 
intelligence," in particular "on the economic and political 
situation in eastern voivodships, theological seminaries, the 
bishops of Przemysl, and so on." 
  Immediately after the arrest of Major A. Lysenko (which took 
place on 23 August 1993), the Embassy of Ukraine in Poland 
established contact with him, and literally from the first to 
the last day regularly held meetings and conversations with 
representatives of the Polish authorities at the highest levels, 
including ministers, the general prosecutor, and the heads of 
relevant services, demanding the release of the Ukrainian 
officer, who had been arrested without grounds. The leadership 
of the Security Service of Ukraine, which sent three letters to 
the relevant Polish organs, resolutely demanded that Major A. 
Lysenko be released. Two notes of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Ukraine were presented to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of Poland; the notes warned about the 
possible consequences of the irresponsible actions of Polish 
special services. The Embassy of Ukraine in Poland also sent one 
note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Poland. Unfortunately, all these measures produced no results. 
  What was the basis for the conviction of the Ukrainian side 
that Major A. Lysenko was arrested without grounds, and for this 
reason should be freed immediately? 
  Major A. Lysenko is a rank-and-file associate of the 
Mostisskiy Rayon Department of the Administration of the 
Security Service of Ukraine for Lvov Oblast. He was never 
involved in any intelligence activities and did not accomplish 
any tasks or special assignments of an intelligence nature. As a 
rayon-level employee, he had functional responsibility for 
putting an end to smuggling and other criminal activities in the 
border rayon, as well as for reviewing issues associated with 
rehabilitation of the victims of political repression. 
  His arrest as a spy cannot even be considered a 
misunderstanding or a consequence of the Polish special services 
being poorly informed. This looks much like a provocation, the 
objective of which is to sow discord in Polish-Ukrainian 
relations, whose favorable development is disliked by some. 
  Staff members of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Republic of 
Poland met with A. Lysenko seven times in prison in Rzeszow and 
in prison in Warsaw on the eve of the trial. He gave the 
impression of being a depressed, broken, and very frightened or 
perhaps terrorized man. He was very concerned about the fate of 
his seriously ill 14-year-old son. He said that he was being 
intimidated with imprisonment for many years, and with being 
punished even more severely in Ukraine if he returned there. 
During one of the visits he said that it had been suggested that 
he renounce his Ukrainian citizenship. In return for this, he 
would be freed, would be able to stay in Poland and bring his 
family over. 
  The question arises of whether Major Lysenko was arrested 
with a view to forcing him to betray the motherland, or whether 
the special services invented this later as a salutary way out 
of the unenviable situation they found themselves in when they 
failed to fabricate a "spy" case. 
  The military court considering the case of A. Lysenko and J. 
Bojarski announced that the trial would be open and allowed 
journalists to attend the trial. The court rejected the protest 
of the prosecutor, after all. Perhaps the prosecutor did not 
want witnesses to see a "spy affair" that has been inflated by 
the mass media to the level of an international scandal turn 
into a ridiculous farce. 
  Both defendants categorically rejected the charges of not 
only spying but also any other activity to the detriment of the 
Polish state. 
  During the initial days of the trial, the court 
cross-examined defendants J. Bojarski and A. Lysenko. The entire 
case was clarified in the course of the cross-examination. 
  Toward the end of 1992 a serious crime was committed in 
Mostisskiy Rayon: Copper contacts were ripped off the rail 
joints on a two-kilometer stretch of the railway. Major Lysenko 
looked into this case. Aware that this crime was committed for 
the purpose of selling copper to Polish smugglers, he began to 
pay close attention to citizens of the neighboring state. In 
January 1993 he noticed two Polish "tourists" hiding scrap 
copper under the seat. Having memorized the license number of 
one car, he gave instructions that it be stopped at the border 
crossing in Sheginy. The person detained turned out to be Janusz 
Bojarski, a small-time Polish smuggler from the small border 
town of Radymno. The major let him go, but gave him his 
telephone number and asked him to call when he was next in 
Mostiska. The major had one goal: to get through Bojarski to the 
sources of supply of nonferrous metals for Polish smugglers in 
Mostisskiy Rayon. Besides, he wanted to determine which of the 
Ukrainian customs officers were allowing the contraband through 
in exchange for bribes. 
  The major did not manage to uncover the nonferrous metals 
thieves. However, a good relationship developed between him and 
Bojarski based on mutual services. A. Lysenko gave J. Bojarski 
passes with which the latter went through customs out of turn 
(at the time one would have to wait two or three days in line), 
while Bojarski brought the major citrus fruit for his sick son 
and merchandise from Poland. 
  Polish special services learned about the contacts between 
Bojarski and the SBU officer, and he was arrested in June 1993. 
  On 23 August 1993 Major Lysenko and his entire family went 
to 
Przemysl, where his son was supposed to be seen by a Polish 
specialist before surgery (already his fourth). He was arrested 
by functionaries of the Polish Security Service immediately at 
the border crossing. 
  He was accused of recruiting Bojarski as a secret agent, 
directing his espionage activities, and receiving needed 
information. 
  The charges of espionage against A. Lysenko and J. Bojarski 
are absurd. However, it was important to someone that this case 
be widely publicized through the mass media and presented in the 
light of a sensational espionage affair. It was precisely in 
this context that Ostankino also reported it, even after the 
second day of the proceedings, after the entire case had been 
clarified.

correspondent: "Belarusian Recoil: It Cannot Go Unnoticed When 
the Position of the Democrat S. Shushkevich is Filled by a 
Militia General"] 
  [Text] Late in the evening on 26 January 1994 in the Oval 
Hall of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, among a 
small group of like-thinkers from the former party nomenklatura 
the power of the Communists was finally restored. As a result of 
a secret vote (in booths), the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, 
S. Shushkevich--the only "new face" on the republic's political 
Olympus--was recalled. 
  Most of the people took what happened calmly; there were no 
heated rallies on the squares. What happened was no surprise to 
the people because they knew their parliament. 
  The parliament of Belarus is a unique phenomenon of modern 
times. It is the largest in the world (in terms of the number of 
members of parliament per capita) and the last on the territory 
of the former USSR to be elected under the leadership of the 
CPSU. Only in the Belarusian parliament are there people who got 
there through quotas of public organizations and, naturally, the 
Communist Party. The revival of the relic could have occurred at 
any time--all that were needed were favorable conditions. 
  The occasion was the arrest in Minsk of two ideological 
soulmates from Lithuania--Burokjavicius and Ermalavicius. 
Everyone knew that the former leaders of the Communist Party of 
the neighboring republic were living in Belarus. They were 
hidden, as it turned out, quite professionally, with the help of 
Belarusian Communists, who were constantly moving from one 
conspirator's apartment to another's. 
  Having isolated itself from the people for a week, the 
Belarusian parliament expressed its international solidarity 
with the two like-thinkers, demanded their return to Belarus, 
and at the same time demanded the firing of the internal affairs 
minister and the KGB chairman. Certainly not because they 
committed certain procedural transgressions when arresting and 
exiling the Lithuanians. The procurator general named a more 
serious blunder: He had verbally sanctioned the arrest (which he 
admitted, although not immediately). But parliament scolded him 
and let him stay in his post. And the generals who were fired 
were paying for the fact that two months earlier they had had 
the audacity to write an open letter to the Supreme Soviet in 
which they protested the Council of Ministers' usurpation of the 
military and militia structures. 
  In the Supreme Soviet's justification for recalling 
Shushkevich the phrase "lack of control" of the activity of the 
aforementioned generals slipped through. But that was not the 
only reason for such a radical decision. An additional, populist 
wording was also generated: "manifestation of personal 
indiscretion." This was suggested by the chairman of the 
temporary commission of the Supreme Soviet "on corruption," a 
people's deputy and sovkhoz director, Aleksandr Lukashenko--a 
rank-and-file participant in the political action to remove 
Shushkevich. 
  The farmers' newspaper NOVAYA ZEMLYA conferred on Lukashenko 
the title "person of the week." His report on corruption 
presented a mixture of generally known facts, slander, rural 
hatred of another's good fortune, and ideological garbage. The 
sovkhoz director dug up inaccuracies in the documents of the 
repair and construction administration of the Council of 
Ministers, which had repaired Shushkevich's apartment and dacha 
and had placed a marker on his mother's grave. Not considering 
it necessary to hear the accused out, the parliamentary relic 
rejoiced: Get that mafia chieftain out of our ranks! 
  By the loutish fist of Lukashenko the party and state 
nomenklatura, united by ideology and corruption, eliminated from 
parliament the foreign element--Shushkevich. To make the fist 
more deadly, troops obedient to the Council of Ministers were 
brought to the Supreme Soviet twice (illegally). 
  But the Communists still would not have dared to remove 
Shushkevich (there were no clear-cut reasons and his ratings 
with the public were high) if external conditions had not been 
favorable--Russia. It is a clear pattern: When there is a 
political storm in Russia, there is political calm in Belarus. 
Here people are waiting to see how things end there. And then 
they will act accordingly. 
  It is possible to see Russian processes in Belarus without a 
magnifying glass. So the Minsk version of the restoration of 
communism is quite plausible in Moscow. 
  The success of the Russian Communists in the elections and 
the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov--these were animating 
factors in the revival of the Belarusian Communist relic. It 
never was an independent organism. Having gained sovereignty, it 
lost its head and froze in inaction. The structural 
rearrangement of the national economy in Belarus was never 
begun. The reforms were merely declared. The land is "public." 
The gigantic plants imposed on the republic by imperial division 
of labor are standing idle without raw material, batching items, 
or wages. The "rabbit" is rapidly growing thin. The population 
is becoming impoverished: Belarus has the lowest per capita 
income in the CIS and the most expensive meat. 
  The main point in the government "program" has remained 
unchanged for several years: "to restore economic ties with 
Russia." That is, to restore everything to the way it was 
before. "Economic alliance," "unification of monetary 
systems"--in the minds of Belarusian strategists these are steps 
on the way to political unification, to a "new federation" (the 
main slogans of the pro-Council of Ministers People's Movement 
of Belarus). 
  Shushkevich was an overt (and covert) counterbalance to the 
communist forces of the two countries--Russia and Belarus--who 
hate him because of the "Belovezha conspiracy" and are nurturing 
plans for the restoration of the USSR. 
  As soon as Shushkevich was sent away, Council of Ministers 
Chairman V. Kebich, making no secret of it, said that he saw a 
"closer" association behind the economic union with Russia. And 
he expressed joy over the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov, who 
will not get in the way now. And he immediately announced his 
idea of reorganizing the entire system of propaganda and 
agitation: "We will take command of the mass media." He did not 
take such liberties under Shushkevich--was he embarrassed or 
something? 
  S. Shushkevich is an undoubted loss to Belarusian democracy 
and national revival. With all of his shortcomings 
(inconsistency, gentleness), he was the guarantor of an 
intelligent and civilized parliament. Shushkevich's departure 
from the political Olympus signifies a decline of its 
moral-ethical level. The youth in parliament distinguished 
themselves by special cruelty during the process of the assault 
on Shushkevich. The "public" elders passed the communist baton 
on to them. 
  The nomenklatura generated an organic particle of itself to 
replace Shushkevich. Comrade general. It should not have been 
otherwise. It was predictable that the nomenklatura would rely 
on trouser stripes and shoulder boards--on force. Mechyslaw Hryb 
was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of 
Belarus (by a secret vote, in booths). He is 57 years old. He is 
a militiaman by education and career. He rose to be chief of the 
internal affairs administration of Vitebsk Oblast. He headed up 
the permanent commission of the Supreme Soviet on questions of 
national security, defense, and fighting crime. 
  M. Hryb is a completely unknown, lackluster personality in 
Belarus. He is a person without a program of his own. He stated 
that the program had already been developed by the Supreme 
Soviet and is being implemented by the government, which he 
supports. He has stated that the foreign policy of Belarus will 
remain the same. But there will be adjustments: a) Belarus will 
ratify the Treaty on Collective Security Within the CIS 
(Shushkevich put forth reservations); b) Belarus will no longer 
talk about pure neutrality since such a concept does not exist; 
c) Belarus is in favor of the speediest and closest union with 
Russia (Shushkevich spoke more about an equal economic 
partnership)... 
  The people are trying to guess which he will be called: 
MeCHYslaw or MecheSLAW. Announcers use both versions.

<F P=106> ["Statement of Liberal Convention of Moldova Republic </F>
Council"] 
  [Text] The Liberal Convention of Moldova, which 
emerged as the result of the unification of the efforts and will 
of people aware of their responsibility for the further fate of 
the democratic reforms, cannot remain indifferent to the process 
of the creation a new supreme legislative body of the country, 
on which the direction of the further development of Moldova as 
an independent state will depend to a large extent. 
  At this pivotal stage of Moldovan history a return to the 
old 
ways and the forms of the organization of society and management 
of the economy which have exhausted their possibilities cannot 
yet be completely ruled out. Reactionary-conservative forces, 
gambling on the masses' fatigue from the inordinate 
politicization of life of recent years and nostalgia for the 
"replete" Brezhnev years and presenting as democracy the 
arbitrary action in economic activity and the lack of respect 
for the order established in society not without the 
participation of representatives of these circles, are nurturing 
the hope of exacting vengeance. In the absence of resistance on 
the part of real democratic and progressive forces, which remain 
fragmented and frequently in thrall to their corporate interests 
and ambitions, the parties and movements of a manifest or 
concealed pro-communist persuasion are endeavoring to make all 
of us hostages of the times of stagnation, unfinished 
undertakings, and their own ignorance. 
  However paradoxical, the conservatives are being rendered 
the 
utmost assistance by social and political organizations and 
parties which appeared in the political arena following the 
split of the People's Front. Having monopolized the right to 
call themselves "democratic" and having pinned on themselves all 
possible designations, they are essentially far removed from a 
constructive approach to the accomplishment of the economic, 
social, and political tasks confronting the people of Moldova 
and are, as before, committing the sin of populism and 
posturing, idealizing individual aspects of our historical past, 
and remaining captive to their vision and understanding of the 
events of recent years to the detriment of a responsible 
approach to a surmounting of the crisis in which the country has 
found itself. 
  The social and political reality of Moldova is manifesting 
increasingly distinctly the main trends in the activity of the 
following political formations: 
  1) right-liberal geared to the continued reform of society 
and the creation of a full-fledged multiparty political system 
and a market economy; 
  2) left-conservative endeavoring overtly or covertly, while 
employing market rhetoric, to take the republic back to the 
administrative-directive system and to the old forms of 
government customary for the nomenklatura; 
  3) forces opposed to the independence and statehood of the 
Republic of Moldova, both pro-unionist and pro-Soviet, for which 
ideological orientation is secondary and is replaced by 
posturing and outright populism. 
  Under these conditions the Liberal Convention of Moldova, 
advocating further constructive and specific steps en route to 
the implementation of liberal reforms, announces its emphatic 
support for the progressive forces and its readiness to 
influence the course of the election campaign in accordance with 
current legislation with its own program principles also. 
  The recent decision of the Central Election Commission, 
which 
limits the Liberal Convention's possibilities of participating 
in practice in the consolidation of the democratic forces, 
leaves the LKM [Liberal Convention of Moldova] no choice but the 
utmost and active support for the independent candidates who 
share the program principles and endeavor of the Convention to 
contribute by actual deeds to the continuation and 
intensification of the progressive transformations and reforms 
in Moldova and to an imperative nature being imparted to this 
process. 
  While not questioning the right of the presidium of 
parliament and the election commission to limit in this way or 
the other the right of political organizations to participate 
fully in the formation of the representative authorities, the 
Liberal Convention nonetheless attributes these decisions to the 
imperfection and immaturity of society's democratic institutions. 
  All independent candidates registered by the Central 
Election 
Commission, sharing the program principles of the LKM, and 
prepared to contribute with real action to their implementation, 
may call 24-07-04 or 22-61-43 to obtain additional information. 
  [Signed] Liberal Convention of Moldova Republic Council

<F P=106> ["Basic Program Principles of the Liberal Convention of </F>
Moldova": "Via Liberal Reforms Toward a Free and Prosperous 
Society"] 
  [Text] The disintegration of the Soviet Union brought about 
the historical and political prerequisites for the acquisition 
by the people of Moldova of real independence and the 
realization in practice of the legitimate right to 
self-determination and the creation of their own statehood. 
  The liberalization of social and political life in the 
republic and individual measures geared to a reform of the 
economy initiated movement toward a new condition of society 
based on a market economy and political pluralism. But the 
half-baked nature of the measures adopted by the legislature and 
the executive in recent years and the absence of a clear concept 
of stabilization of the situation in the economy and of arrival 
at a new quality of development led to the destruction of the 
previous economic, social, and political structures and to the 
underdevelopment of the new ones. As a result society has found 
itself in a dangerous situation fraught with permanent 
sociopolitical and economic crisis. 
  The Liberal Convention of Moldova believes that there is no 
alternative to the further development of democracy, a radical 
reform of property relations, and the creation of a full-fledged 
and efficient economic system based on market mechanisms. There 
is no other way of extricating the country from the crisis and 
of the creation of favorable conditions for the formation of the 
state. 
  The key question consists of the formulation of a clear and 
consistent concept of reforms based on the creative application 
of the principles of liberalism and in accordance with the 
particular features of the economy of Moldova, with the evolved 
mentality and traditions of the people. Without a vision by all 
citizens of Moldova of the conceptual trajectory of movement, 
without an understanding of long-range and immediate goals, and 
without specific programs of transformations at the macro- and 
microeconomic levels, renewal and a new quality of Moldova's 
socioeconomic development will not be achieved. 
  In the absence of mature political parties and democratic 
traditions in Moldovan society, an effective instrument of the 
democratic reform of the country in the initial phase of the 
formation of the civil society are the state and its power 
structures. The Liberal Convention of Moldova regards power as a 
real opportunity for and the basic lever of implementation of 
comprehensive programs of transformations on the basis of 
liberal doctrine and with regard to the specifics and salient 
features of Moldova. 
  These program principles, which have been made the basis of 
the activity of the Liberal Convention of Moldova and which 
contain the main directions of further liberal reforms in the 
political, economic, and social spheres, could contribute to a 
stabilization of the situation at the transitional stage and 
impart new impetus to the country's development on the path of 
democracy and progress. 
<H3>  Freedom Under the Conditions of Order--Toward an Efficient 
Law-Based and Democratic Society </H3>
  In the political sphere the Liberal Convention considers a 
principal goal the strengthening of the statehood of the 
Republic of Moldova and the country's further development as an 
independent, sovereign, and democratic state. 
  The Moldovan people's right to statehood is the right to the 
preservation of its distinctiveness and the creation of the 
necessary conditions for the more than 4.5 million citizens of 
different nationalities of the republic, who are capable only by 
joint efforts of extricating society from the crisis, 
stabilizing the situation, and creating living conditions for 
the present and future generations which are worthy of man at 
the end of the 20th century. 
  It is important to adopt national features of Moldovan 
statehood, ensuring simultaneously the principle of equal 
opportunities for all citizens before the law, regardless of 
national affiliation. Setting the goal of the creation of a 
minimum, but strong and effective state, with regard to the 
residual influence of the authoritarian regime on people's frame 
of mind and the particular features of the mass consciousness at 
the stage transitional to a full-fledged and efficient 
democratic society, the formation of a strong presidential 
republic is justified and logical. 
  The head of state, elected by the whole people, should have 
the opportunities for corrective influence on the branches of 
power for the purpose of assurance of the operation of the 
constitution and laws of the country and the rights and 
liberties of its citizens. 
  An improvement of the institutions of the state presupposes 
primarily a delineation of the political and economic 
authorities, a decisive reduction in the role and influence of 
the state as a subject of economic relations via active 
privatization and the growth of nonstate property in the 
economy, the increased competence and responsibility of 
employees of the machinery of state, and effective control of 
the executive structures on the part of the organs of 
representative power. 
  In the immediate future the state will retain the functions 
of regulation at the macroeconomic level, in the main, ensuring 
a reasonable proportion between the economic liberty of the 
members of society and directed influence in accordance with the 
economic and social programs of the governing majority. 
  The principle of interethnic accord and the settlement of 
disagreements by the peaceful, democratic path should be a 
fundamental proposition of the state's domestic policy. This 
would permit the positive resolution of the problem of social 
stability and ensure a dynamic balance of the interests of the 
multinational population of the republic. 
  On the other hand, consistent and decisive measures of the 
power structures in respect to the use of constitutional means 
to ensure the territorial integrity of Moldova and the unity and 
inviolability of its territory are essential. 
  The resolution of the conflicts in the Dniester region and 
the south of Moldova based on the maximum consideration of 
current realities and strictly in accordance with the rules of 
international law, the principles of the European process, and 
UN decisions is a principal condition of the restoration of 
sovereignty throughout the territory of the republic and of 
peace and tranquillity in the republic. 
  The decentralization of state power, the transfer of 
managerial functions to the local government authorities, their 
release from the tutelage of the "center," and the legislative 
enshrinement of these principles in the course of 
administrative-territorial reform would make it possible to 
organize the more precise interaction of the authorities in the 
center and locally on the basis of a delineation of authority 
and to enhance the efficiency of the power structures in the 
defense of social interests. 
  A principal function of the state should be realization of 
the right of the citizen to be a proprietor, the optimum 
conditions for free competition, and the surmounting of monopoly 
trends. 
  The continued democratization of society means first and 
foremost the creation and assurance of the normal activity of a 
civil society. The formation of a protected environment for the 
freedom of the individual and the subordination of political and 
state power to a community of free people via the consolidation 
of the institutions of the civil society--social and political 
organizations, societies, and citizens' associations, nonstate 
organizations and institutions, and so forth which aim at the 
support and protection of the autonomy, initiative, and 
responsibility of each individual and people's creative 
activity--could impart an irreversible nature to the progressive 
transformations. 
  The gradual return of the functions usurped by the state to 
a 
self-governing civil society, the establishment of limited 
administration and the minimum state jurisdiction under the 
conditions of the existence of a clear-cut legislative base and 
assurance of the efficiency of the law-and-order authorities and 
the state authorities as a whole would make it possible to 
realize in practice the principle of freedom under the 
conditions of order. 
  The creation and assurance of the efficient functioning of a 
multiparty system and subsequent elections to the country's 
parliament on a multiparty basis would make it possible to 
enhance the degree of responsibility of the power structures, 
and a real instrument of opposition to political voluntarism and 
totalitarian tendencies would arise. A parliamentary system and 
the mature, responsible approach of the political parties to 
support for the efficiency of its activity would afford an 
opportunity for the resolution of social contradictions in 
civilized fashion, in the interests of the majority, and with 
maximum consideration of the opinion of the minority. Thus real 
prerequisites for a qualitatively new level, social stability, 
and the consolidation of the multinational society would emerge. 
A constructive opposition to the authorities would be created 
via the multiparty system, which would enable the latter to take 
account of the diverse interests and social expectations of 
different strata and groups of society. 
  Aside from the creation of a civil society and assurance of 
the functioning of a multiparty system, further democratization 
includes the following aspects: 
  the real separation of the branches of power to prevent the 
authorities' slide toward political voluntarism and the tendency 
to establish an authoritarian regime of government; 
  the realization at all levels of activity of the political 
system and state power of the principle of political liberalism, 
which contributes to control of the authorities on the part of 
society and of the "managers" on the part of the "managed"; 
  the building of an effective state based on the rule of law 
and a defender of the rights and liberties of the citizen. The 
consistent conversion of the interventionist state and the 
legacy of the totalitarian regime into a management authority 
and state administration; 
  the adoption of a constitution of the Republic of 
Moldova--the charter of power and the basic voluntary compact 
between the individual and the state; 
  the improvement of legislation to create the legal 
conditions 
for the realization in day-to-day practice of the fundamental 
values of liberalism; 
  the creation of a climate of broad cooperation among all 
political formations and social and political organizations of 
Moldova of a liberal-reform persuasion for the surmounting of 
reactionary-conservative trends still capable of winding down 
the reforms in society that have begun and restoring the 
totalitarian regime in an individual post-Soviet republic; 
  maintenance of a high moral and ethical level in political 
activity and in public life as a whole without renunciation of 
particular principles and consistency in their defense. 
  The pursuit of an active and consistent foreign policy and a 
guarantee of national security are a most important function of 
the young Moldovan state. 
  The world community's recognition of the Republic of Moldova 
as an independent state and the country's membership of a number 
of international organizations have created for us a 
qualitatively new situation, where the foreign policy course, 
reflecting national-state interests, is developing in accordance 
with the principles of the United Nations and the European 
process, the rules of international law, and values common to 
all mankind. 
  The particular features of Moldova's geopolitical location 
in 
the south of East Europe, the ethno-demographic composition of 
the population, and the economic and defense potential of the 
country predetermine political and diplomatic means as the basic 
means in assurance of the security of the republic at the 
complex stage of its development as a new European state in the 
post-totalitarian era. The maintenance of friendly and mutually 
beneficial relations with contiguous states, primarily with 
Romania and Ukraine, which are for us the gates to the West and 
to the East, is of exceptional significance for Moldova. 
  The common ethnic roots, language, historical past, and 
culture objectively predetermine the priority relations of the 
Republic of Moldova and Romania. The Liberal Convention 
advocates the surmounting of the excessive politicization of 
Moldovan-Romanian relations and the consistent expansion and 
intensification of mutually profitable trade and economic, 
cultural, and other relations between the two states. By joint 
and concerted efforts we would succeed in ridding ourselves more 
quickly of the sinister legacy of totalitarianism and 
dictatorship engendering radical nationalism and nostalgia for 
the past. 
  Relations with Russia remain a most important issue of 
Moldova's foreign policy. They should be built on the basis of 
respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two 
states and the development of mutually beneficial relations in 
the economic sphere and science and culture. The exclusion of 
double standards and pressure in the solution of questions of a 
political nature and interference in internal affairs and, in 
particular, the withdrawal of Russian troops from the eastern 
parts of the republic and a resolution of the Dniester conflict 
in accordance with the rules of international law could 
consolidate Moldovan-Russian relations. 
  Paramount significance, particularly at the transitional 
stage, is attached to mutual relations with the states of the 
CIS built on a treaty and bilateral and multilateral basis. They 
are conditioned by the continued economic ties and 
interdependence of the economies and the long-term possibilities 
of these countries as markets for the sale of Moldovan 
commodities and supplies of energy and raw material on terms 
beneficial to the republic. 
  It is essential to stimulate Moldova's affiliation to the 
integration processes in Central and East Europe and the 
countries of the Black Sea in order to obtain access to the 
dynamically developing capital, technology, raw material, and 
industrial commodity markets. The formation and development of 
all-around cooperation with the United States remains an 
important strategic direction. 
  Multilateral contacts and effective participation in the 
activity of international organizations--the United Nations, 
CSCE, IMF, World Bank, GATT, the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, and others--could contribute to 
a stabilization of the situation in Moldova and ensues logically 
from the policy of the openness of Moldovan society and the 
assurance of economic and national security. 
  A most palpable threat to the security of Moldova and to the 
republic's existence as a sovereign state is the aspiration of 
certain influential circles of Russia to restore the former 
communist superpower within its previous borders. This threat, 
which acquired real outline following the victory of the Russian 
nationalist radicals at the recent parliamentary elections, can 
only be resisted by Moldova's active participation in the 
creation of an all-European system of security under the aegis 
of the CSCE. A broadening of contacts with the North Atlantic 
alliance, which has an interest in the prevention of regional 
conflicts and in the assurance of stability on the old 
continent, is in Moldova's interests in this context. 
  A precise ascertainment of the structure of the real and 
potential threats to the country's security and independence 
should form the basis of the determination of the level of 
sufficiency and the organization of the armed forces of the 
republic and the determination of their manning level and the 
nature of their provision with equipment and arms. It is 
essential to bring the system of national security into line 
with the principles of the law-based, democratic state and the 
rules of international law, considering national-historical 
traditions and world experience. 
  The army of the Republic of Moldova is not only an attribute 
of statehood but also a real force for countering potential 
military danger and our specific contribution to the European 
security system which is being created. 
  The gradual and planned transition to professional armed 
forces smaller in size and providing for a high level of combat 
readiness would make it possible to accomplish efficiently the 
assignments confronting the army and to reduce appreciably the 
burden of military spending. 
<H3>  Toward an Efficient Market Economy Via a Surmounting of the 
Crisis, Stabilization of the Situation, and the Realization of 
Comprehensive Programs of Transformations </H3>
  Not only the future of our state but also its very existence 
and, consequently, stability in this region of Europe will 
depend on the capacity for normalizing the situation in the 
economy and formulating and implementing adequate measures for a 
way out of the protracted crisis in which Moldova has found 
itself. 
  The complexity of this problem is intensified by the need 
for 
the simultaneous accomplishment of several tasks which are 
difficult even for an economy which is developing in stable 
fashion: a halt to the decline in production and the reduction 
in the gross national product and the drop in society's living 
standard, a surmounting of the structural and technology gap, 
and continuation of the transition to a market economy. 
  The Liberal Convention considers as the main causes of the 
intensification of the crisis in the economy the following: 
  1. An orientation toward the production and sale of 
agricultural raw material and its primary processing is 
predominant in the agro-industrial complex. The republic's 
industry, with the rare exception of individual enterprises, is 
in a neglected state and is practically unadapted to independent 
economic activity under the new conditions. All that is produced 
in the country and intended for export is barely sufficient to 
cover expenditure on the purchase of raw material and energy 
outside of Moldova. Hyperinflation is being imported together 
with them from the CIS countries. 
  2. The comprehensive and phased transfer of the economy to 
market mechanisms of the regulation of production activity is 
chronically behind schedule. The state retains, as before, the 
plenitude of power in the economic sphere, gravitating toward 
the customary administrative-command means and levers of control 
and engendering thereby voluntarism and, frequently, an 
inappropriate response to changing economic realities. 
  3. The half-baked nature and contradictoriness of the 
measures in the sphere of privatization and the fruitless waste 
of time in arguments about the forms and means of the 
denationalization of state property, instead of the creation of 
effective levers and the infrastructure of the engagement of 
private initiative--individual and group--in the accomplishment 
of national economic tasks, are imparting a chronic nature to 
the economic crisis. 
  4. Instead of stimulating small and medium-sized business 
and 
the process of the original accumulation of capital and its 
subsequent investment in the production sphere, the state, via a 
tax system of a manifestly confiscatory nature, is suppressing 
private initiative and provoking the mass drain of capital 
outside of Moldova. This is causing a chronic shortage of 
consumer goods and hyperinflation. 
  5. The sluggish nature of foreign economic policy, the 
absence of new markets for the sale of Moldovan products and 
imports of raw material and energy, and an incapacity for 
attracting to Moldova foreign investments in the sectors where 
this is justified by a lack of resources and progressive 
technology are making the situation in the economy worse. 
  6. None of the last three Moldovan governments has had a 
program, precise and considered in detail, of a way out of the 
socioeconomic crisis and transition to the market economy. The 
declared transition to a market model is being undertaken in a 
"groping" manner and by way of a copying of foreign experience. 
On the pretext of the realization of measures to stabilize the 
economy, a return to the old forms of administration and 
management is being undertaken. 
  7. The legislative base, which was originally created for 
support of the transition to the market, is frequently of a 
general nature and does not reflect the normalities and salient 
features of Moldova or a specific model and concept of 
transformations. The prerequisites for a free interpretation of 
the laws and the appearance of a mass of legally binding 
enactments creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the majority 
of subjects of economic relations are being created hereby. 
  An appreciable and positive role in the solution of the 
entire set of economic questions could be performed by foreign 
investments. The experience accumulated in the last three years 
testifies that it would be a mistake to rely exclusively on 
economic assistance from outside. The basis of an anticrisis 
program should be the stimulation of domestic manufacturers and 
investors. Assistance will be rendered to those who have shown 
their capacity for working efficiently and those who save and 
invest in the development of production and contribute to the 
creation of new jobs in all spheres of economic activity. 
  Reliance first and foremost on our own potential 
possibilities, a policy of the coordination of efforts in the 
sphere of the economy with the CIS countries, and the attraction 
of foreign investments to the spheres in which it is impossible 
to overcome the crisis phenomena thanks to our own potential 
could set the necessary directions for overcoming the crisis. 
  The second strategic direction consists of the choice of the 
correct priorities for surmounting the technology gap and 
providing for the structural reorganization of the economy. In 
the sphere of material production the priorities for Moldova are: 
  saturation of the market in short order with food and 
consumer merchandise; 
  the creation and modernization of the technological and 
production base of the processing of agricultural produce and 
the production of competitive foods; 
  the structural reorganization and, where necessary, the 
conversion of the former defense enterprises of industry and the 
development of research-intensive and energy-saving works; 
  the solution of questions of the republic's stable energy 
supply and supplies of the necessary quantity of energy 
resources; 
  an expansion of the production of building materials using 
local raw material and a buildup of the facilities of 
construction and building materials industry, primarily for the 
erection of housing; 
  the introduction universally of environmentally clean 
technology; 
  the formation of a modern infrastructure--transport, 
communications, power engineering, tourism, and a hotel network. 
  The main driving force of the special programs at the macro- 
and microeconomic levels should be the active denationalization 
and privatization of property and the large-scale inclusion of 
private initiative and free enterprise in the accomplishment of 
economic tasks combined with the regulatory role of the state. 
  It is essential to formulate clear stages of the reform of 
the economy, moving from a stabilization of the situation to a 
full-fledged market model integrated in the world system of 
economic relations. 
  The first stage is 1994. The main task: saturation of the 
consumer market with commodities, which is a principal condition 
of the assurance of social stability and the continuation of 
market reforms. 
  The means and mechanisms of the accomplishment of the said 
task are: 
  the active and large-scale privatization of small and 
medium-sized enterprises, facilities of the service sphere, and 
housing. The creation of an infrastructure for the support of 
efficient investment and the free movement of capital; 
securities markets, trust companies, investment funds, and so 
forth; 
  the channeling of the resources obtained from privatization 
into the creation of a liberal fund for the support of the 
private sector and the stimulation of the initial accumulation 
and investment of capital in socially significant production 
sectors of the economy; 
  the abandonment of a fiscal tax policy of total confiscatory 
taxation and the flexible use of economic levers to stimulate 
investments in the economy of the republic and prevent a drain 
of capital abroad; 
  the liberalization of export and import activity and 
regulation of commodity-supply exports and imports by economic 
measures and the abandonment of rigid bureaucratic 
administration of trade and economic relations with other 
countries; 
  the pursuit of an active antitrust policy and the 
stimulation 
of competition on the domestic market and the production of 
high-quality goods for export; 
  the concessionary taxation of investments in the production 
sphere and in the priority areas of the development of industry, 
agriculture, and consumer service; 
  the local concessionary transfer and long-term lease and 
sale 
of land to foreign investors on the strength of progressive 
engineering designs (model farms, processing complexes, and so 
forth); 
  the creation of free economic zones to attract foreign 
investments and modern technology, the creation of jobs, and the 
training of personnel for work under the conditions of the 
market economy (the Danube-South zone, Dniester-East, 
Chisinau-Center, Beltsy-North). The development of comprehensive 
government programs of the creation of the zones and the 
legislative enshrinement of the conditions of their activity; 
  the preservation of profitable agricultural enterprises and 
their conversion into stock companies. The denationalization of 
unprofitable production units and their conversion into private 
and cooperative enterprises and effective assistance to them at 
the stage of the formation of new forms of management in 
agriculture; 
  the creation of the necessary base and infrastructure for 
agrarian reform; specialized banks, exchanges, investment funds, 
production of agricultural equipment, and so forth; 
  an increase in the efficiency of the use of the research 
potential of Moldova and the development of venture enterprise 
providing for high returns and rapid savings. 
  Development of the agro-industrial complex of Moldova and 
its 
consistent and decisive reform and also measures to saturate the 
consumer market with foodstuffs should remain a principal 
strategic priority. 
  A key issue in this sphere is the development of small-scale 
rural processing industry. Utilizing economic levers, the main 
thing is to ensure the necessary investments for the 
construction or equipping of a designed number of small and 
medium-sized enterprises on the basis of compact equipment 
capable of manufacturing in situ a high-quality end product. 
  This would make it possible to reduce losses of agricultural 
raw material and create additional and prestigious jobs for the 
rural population. The funds of shareholders in the person of 
agricultural enterprises with mixed capital, private 
investments, and government resources would be mobilized to this 
end. 
  The destruction of the kolkhozes (stock companies) and the 
mass privatization of the land and fixed capital in the agrarian 
sector would be an unforgivable mistake. Consistent and 
carefully considered measures ensuring the proportionality and 
competition of all forms of ownership are needed more here than 
in any other sphere of economic activity. At the initial stage 
of comprehensive agrarian reform the state should render private 
initiative and the private farms effective support, creating for 
them the optimum conditions of activity and the prerequisites 
for healthy competition to emerge. 
  The government should draw up as quickly as possible a 
program of the attraction and utilization of foreign investments 
and of the importation and assimilation of modern technology 
with regard to the chosen strategy and priorities. 
  At the second stage (1995-1999) the denationalization of 
large-scale enterprises and their conversion into stock 
companies with the equal participation of the state as a 
shareholder in the sectors of strategic significance for Moldova 
and also the sale of production units to private individuals 
will continue. 
  Important content of this stage of the formation of 
full-fledged market relations should be new driving forces and 
stimuli of the development of the economy: the genuine freedom 
of all commodity producers, the engagement of full-fledged 
market mechanisms, land reform and the rational use and 
conservation of natural resources, and the effective 
incorporation of free economic zones in the country's single 
economic complex. 
  This stage will be characterized by the formation of 
developed commodity and currency markets and other 
markets--capital, manpower, securities, intellectual property. A 
competent personnel corps in the field of domestic and 
international business will gradually be created. Altogether 
these measures will create the necessary prerequisites of the 
normal functioning of an open-type market model of the economy 
with the minimum intervention on the part of the state and based 
on private initiative and competition protected by law. 
  Problems of the budget deficit and the convertibility of the 
national currency will be resolved as the market relations are 
built. 
  The surmounting of the extensive development of the economy 
and a rational approach to the utilization of natural resources, 
primarily the land and energy- and resource-saving technology, 
will create real prerequisites for the restoration of the upset 
balance in nature and make it possible to realize directed 
measures for protection of the environment also. 
  The strategy of transition to a market economy should be the 
economic ideology of the whole of society, of everyone who 
considers Moldova his homeland and is prepared to share with it 
the burdens of the transitional period and the joy of future 
well-being. 
<H5>  Lowering Tension in Society and Social Development </H5>
  Questions of social development are closely interconnected 
with society's achievement of a particular level of economic 
well-being making it possible to provide for the redistribution 
of material and financial resources for a solution of questions 
of a social nature. The saturation in short order of the 
consumer market with food and industrial commodities would 
create the prerequisites at the initial stage of the reforms for 
a lowering of social tension and the restoration of normal 
conditions for a stabilization of the situation in the economy. 
On the other hand, a reduction in the inflation hitting 
constantly at personal income could also stabilize the situation 
not only in the economy but in society as a whole as well. 
  There is no doubt that as long as the republic is in a state 
of protracted economic crisis and until effective measures to 
get the better of inflation have been adopted, only 
irresponsible populists and political adventurers could promise 
a solution of absolutely all social questions. 
  At the stage of stabilization of the situation in the 
socioeconomic sphere the Liberal Convention considers paramount 
the following questions: 
  government support and the creation of normal living 
conditions for the disabled and needy strata of 
society--retirees, the handicapped, large families, and trainee 
youth. Strict consideration of the level of inflation and a 
timely increase in pensions, grants, and allowances; 
  prevention of a decline in research, culture, education, and 
health care and government subsidies for them; 
  stimulation of the creation of jobs and the assurance of 
social safeguards against unemployment; 
  the development of diverse systems of insurance, private 
included, for the creation of additional channels of social 
protection. 
  Provision will be made for these areas of social protection 
primarily from budget appropriations, the resources of the funds 
that are created, and with the help of government stimulation of 
philanthropy. 
  Throughout the stabilization period, public medical services 
and education will remain free of charge. The subsequent and 
gradual introduction of private medical establishments and 
educational institutions must be undertaken so as not to be in 
any way detrimental to the general educational level of the 
citizens. 
  With regard to the structural transformations in industry 
and 
agriculture close attention needs to be paid to the system of 
the retraining of specialists and workers and to the migration 
of manpower. 
  A large share of responsibility will be borne by the 
fledgling class of entrepreneurs. The assistance they render the 
disabled part of society and the preservation of the solidarity 
of all strata of the populace in the difficult period of 
transition to the market economy could exert a positive 
influence on social processes and preserve peace and 
tranquillity in the country. 
  An important condition of the achievement of this goal is 
the 
for assurance of each who so desires it of entrepreneurial 
freedom and the possibility of application of his powers in any 
sphere of activity in order that the more capable, industrious, 
and enterprising may attain to a higher social status in society. 
  The appearance of a social stratum of Moldovan 
entrepreneurs, 
15-20 percent of the total number of the able-bodied population, 
is a key factor of the realization of transformations, 
stabilization of the situation, continuation of market reforms, 
and assurance of economic upturn. 
  The large social group of the intelligentsia, managers, and 
former career servicemen constitutes a good potential base of 
the future middle stratum. 
  The formation of the new social structure of society will 
directly influence the machinery of state also and, via this 
latter, the efficiency of the activity of the state. It is 
essential to adopt measures to enhance the status, social image, 
and protection of public employees. The departure of skilled 
specialists for the commercial structures is exerting a negative 
influence on the capacity of the machinery of state for 
upholding public interests. 
  The incomplete nature of the reforms and the retention in 
the 
hands of the machinery of state of practically the plenitude of 
power, economic included, with the low pay of the employees and 
the simultaneous accumulation of capital among representatives 
of business circles and also the absence of precise and 
long-term legal guarantees of their activity are creating 
altogether an extremely dangerous situation socially which is 
stimulating corruption and other crimes of office. The 
imperfection of the legislative base regulating the rights and 
obligations of the employees of the machinery of state and the 
activity of the law enforcement authorities in the fight against 
this social evil are making this situation worse and imparting a 
chronic nature to it. The Liberal Convention advocates the 
decisive eradication of corruption and other malfeasance by the 
authorities by way of the elimination of their causes and the 
strict application of the law in respect to all offenses, 
regardless of the position held. 
  A change in the value orientation in society thanks to the 
directed formation of a pro-market consciousness in the 
population, in the young people primarily, is an important 
factor. 
  A principal component of the social strategy of the Liberal 
Convention is the assurance on the basis of the development of 
the market economy of a high living standard and quality of life 
for all groups of the country's population, which would ensure 
the stability and dynamism of the development of Moldovan 
society. 
  Considering the social stratification of society an 
inevitable process accompanying market reforms and the 
democratization of society, the Liberal Convention believes that 
a principal task in the social sphere, in the transitional 
period particularly, is the reduction to a rational minimum of 
the difference in personal income levels, economic levers being 
utilized for this. A balanced policy in this sphere would make 
it possible to avoid possible social conflicts caused by the 
difficulties of adaptation to the new realities. 
  The fundamental principles of liberalism presuppose the 
introduction in all spheres of the activity of people and 
society of the principle of the equality before the law of all 
citizens, regardless of nationality and religious belief. The 
establishment of a climate of trust and dialogue, the removal of 
any form of discrimination, and the surmounting of egotism, 
group ambitions, and the habit of creating an enemy where 
constructive cooperation is needed would help us attain to a 
qualitatively new state of society that is freer and more 
civilized. 
  In the future the combination in day-to-day practice of the 
principles of political and economic liberalism will make it 
possible to create a social environment in which the majority of 
people live freely, which will be guaranteed by private property 
and control over the political authorities on the part of the 
civil society.

<F P=106> [Article by PRAVDA correspondent Arkadiy Pasechnik: "Speaker </F>
and Prime Minister Hastily Turn Into Agrarians: Moldova on the 
Threshold of Elections"] 
  [Text] One can say with certainty that the campaign 
for preparation for early elections to the parliament of 
Moldova, set for 27 February, has not calmed the republic's 
public life. Rather the reverse: Parties and movements that have 
jumped into the election race threw themselves with gusto into 
mutual score-settling at all sorts of meetings, in newspapers, 
and on the air. 
  The accents at political battlefields have shifted 
perceptibly. Just a few months ago it was considered good 
manners in the local political establishment to blame all 
troubles on the ill-fated parliament. A complete fiasco in the 
economy, the impoverishment of the people, the republic split 
into pieces... Now that the parliament is living through its 
last days, the role of a scapegoat more often is attached to 
representatives of the parties that already had deputy mandates 
and are vying for them again (of whom, we should note, there are 
quite a few). The logic is simple: They have already messed up 
everything and now they are going for it again. 
  Elections by party lists, by the way, is not the only 
innovation in the election law adopted in October of last year. 
The number of seats in Moldova's supreme legislative body has 
been cut by more than a factor of three--to 104. Only those 
parties and movements which will gather at least 4 percent of 
the total number of the electorate vote may count on these 
mandates. 
  Such rigid restrictions have predetermined to a large extent 
high heat since the very early stage of the election marathon. 
Of 26 parties and movements officially registered in Moldova 
only half have been able to register their lists with the 
Central Electoral Commission [CEC]. Only on the third try did 
CEC members vote to register the list of candidates from the 
bloc of leftist forces, formed by the Socialist Party of Moldova 
and the "Unitata-Unity" intermovement, and even that after 
removing from the title the words "leftist forces" and dropping 
from the list Petr Shornikov--a current deputy and one of the 
intermovement's founders--whose name was close to the top of the 
list. Shornikov's "transgression" was that he had delivered a 
series of lectures in Tiraspol university (after he had lost his 
job in Chisinau, by the way). "...What we have is an attempt by 
representatives of parties and organizations of 
unionist-frontist orientation in the CEC to perpetrate a purge 
of the future parliament already at the start of the election 
campaign," KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI newspaper commented on this 
fact. 
  From the very beginning, the Agrarian-Democratic Party of 
Moldova [ADPM] positioned itself as one of the leaders in the 
race. The agrarian deputy faction had been a rather impressive 
political force in the "departing" parliament as well, which 
more than once determined the fate of principal battles. The 
peasant tendency for caution and deliberation is reflected 
appropriately in the centrist position taken by this party, 
which cannot fail to appeal to a majority of rural voters. In 
addition, at the very threshold of the election the ADPM 
received a solid boost in the personae of current Parliament 
Speaker Petru Lucinschi and Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, who 
are listed in the agrarians' electoral list as Nos. 2 and 3, 
respectively. Next, most observers line up the contender parties 
in approximately the following order: social democratic; 
socialist; republican and the party of reform; the CDPF 
(Christian-Democratic Popular Front) alliance, and so on. 
  Local press is currently filled with electoral lists of 
parties and blocs and their programs. Most of these lengthy 
documents contain very correct ideas and words regarding the 
sociopolitical situation in the republic, the necessity of 
urgent measures aimed at reanimation of the economy, combating 
crime and corruption, and protection of the indigent. The 
difference begins to come through as soon as it comes to the 
point of discussing the method of future development of Moldova. 
Agrarians, social democrats, republicans, and socialists aim at 
building an independent state. The other part of the spectrum of 
parties--the CDPF, the Democratic Party, and the Democratic 
Labor Party--advocate unification with Romania. 
  Unfortunately, this position of the latter costs the 
republic 
very, very dearly--from the still oozing wounds of the bloody 
conflict on Dniester to immense economic losses stemming from 
Moldova's long procrastination regarding joining the CIS and all 
resulting consequences. Through suffering, deprivation, and 
pain, the society is coming to an understanding of harsh 
realities of current life. All last year's sociological surveys 
invariably registered the decline in the rating of the Popular 
Front and its fixation on unification with Romania, which, in 
the opinion of some observers, prompted some CDPF leaders to 
hastily distance themselves from it and quickly put together 
their own parties and movements. Others see in it only a 
pre-election operational maneuver, a peculiar attempt to achieve 
victory if not by aptitude (in this case it would be more 
appropriate to say--political authority) then by numbers. 
  Actually, it is unlikely that the "unionists" themselves 
believe in their victory. Hence their vicious attacks in the 
local radical press against leaders and parties that are 
considered likely to succeed. In short, there is no shortage of 
predictions. As there is, actually, no substantial spread of 
opinions. In all probability the Agrarian-Democratic Party will 
win the election with 33-35 percent of the vote--this is the 
opinion, for instance, of Anatoliy Gudym [name as 
transliterated], the head of the expert center of the 
Industrialists Union of Moldova. Social democrats' chances are 
considered to be quite good (among their assets are a score of 
political initiatives and the European model of reforming the 
economy), the party of reform (or, as it is unofficially called, 
the directors party), and socialists, who are most consistent in 
defending the rights of citizens regardless of nationality. 
  Overall, many experts believe that the new parliament will 
be 
an improvement over the previous one. First and foremost by its 
qualitative composition: Its core will be comprised of 
professional politicians, economists, and jurists. They will, of 
course, inherit a terrible legacy. In its legislative "itch" the 
previous parliament over three years has "baked" over 200 laws, 
which nevertheless did not save the republic from political and 
economic cataclysms. Now instead of such a long running in place 
(or sometimes backwards) several very serious steps forward will 
be required simultaneously: adoption of a new constitution; 
ratification of documents on CIS membership; moving the economy 
forward; and resolution of the Dniester area and Gagauz 
problems. Because in a split Moldova even a new constitution 
will remain more of a symbolic document, and one cannot speak, 
of course, of an integrated economic organism without the 37 
percent of the republic's industrial potential that is located 
on the Dniester left bank. Or a reform aimed at nursing this 
organism to health. Will the new parliament be able to rid 
itself of the intolerance syndrome of its predecessor and set up 
an effective political dialog with the Dniester area? For the 
time being, however, Tiraspol and Komrat authorities decided not 
to hold elections to the Moldovan Parliament in their regions, 
which, in the opinion of a number of observers, only plays into 
the hands of radicals of all colors. 
  Finally, one more circumstance that has a most immediate 
bearing on the election campaign. President Mircea Snegur, who 
somewhat demonstratively had maintained his distance from this 
campaign, finally did break his neutrality. He said that he 
would support in the elections those parties that advocate an 
independent Moldova. And literally a few days ago Snegur 
proposed to conduct a national sociological survey--"consult 
with the people"--asking just one question: on independence and 
integrity of Moldova (the Parliament Presidium accepted this 
proposal). In this way the president is, first, trying to gain 
support in his struggle against the opposition, which 
increasingly vehemently accuses him of blocking the process of 
unification with Romania, and, second, wants through the mouth 
of the people to give a sort of mandate to future members of the 
country's supreme legislative body.

"Privatization-94": Somebody Must Leave"] 
  [Text] The "war of the edicts" between the Department 
of Privatization and the Ministry of the Economy continues. The 
duel began back in the spring of last year and by the time it 
ended the ministry was left with the right to shoot. It took 
advantage of this right by preparing in October and finally 
approving on 5 January of this year the draft edict "On Measures 
for Regulating the Reorganization of Enterprises During the 
Process of Implementing the State Program for Privatization in 
the Republic of Moldova During 1993-1994." As of 12 January the 
draft had been okayed by the Procuracy of the Republic of 
Moldova, the Ministry of Finance, the Commission on State 
Control, the State Property Fund and, naturally, the Ministry of 
Economics itself. 
  As you can see, consent has been given by all the interested 
ministries and control organs; the only thing lacking is the 
signature of Mircea Snegur, after which four pages of 
typewritten text written by the bureaucratic hand will magically 
be transformed into an edict of the president of the Republic of 
Moldova. True, it has not been signed by another department 
which also has something to do with privatization--the 
department with the same name. But is a convict frequently asked 
to consent to the sentence that is handed down? And the 
aforementioned edict is nothing other than a sentence both for 
the department itself and for the policy it has been 
"implementing" during the past two years. 
  What are the chances that the edict will be signed by the 
president and, as they say, "take effect on the day it is 
signed"? The authors of the draft themselves estimate it as 
50-50, but there are certain peculiarities that give reason to 
think that they are either being modest or are afraid of 
endangering their success. All preceding attempts on the part of 
the department and the ministry (the first was to consolidate 
their grip on the "heights" they had seized and the second was 
to push their rival off from them) ended in mutual failure, 
which largely suited the department as the defending side. Its 
persistence was largely determined by the personality of the 
leader and general director, Vissarion Cesuev. A pragmatist and 
a romantic, a swindler and practically a holy man prepared for 
self-sacrifice--this is how he is described by people from the 
"interested ministries and control organs." Today he is included 
on the election list of the SDPM [Social Democratic Party of 
Moldova] and, as a member of the coordinating council of this 
party, is among the top 10. He would be assured a place in the 
future parliament, but even before 27 February, according to the 
Law "On Elections," he would have to temporarily resign from his 
position as director and go on leave. In any case the department 
would lose its support and its banner. And it feels like a 
football team whose star goalkeeper has been injured and there 
is nobody to replace him. Moreover, there are very persistent 
rumors that are very close to the truth saying that the 
president's edict on firing Cesuev has already been prepared. 
This edict is also lacking the president's signature. 
  The second peculiarity is also closely linked to the 
elections. The defeat of the department is above all a blow to 
the Social Democratic Party, and since this blow was prepared 
for in the government, one automatically recalls that 
practically all the government leaders (the prime minister and 
two of his deputies) ran for parliament on the ADPM [Agrarian 
Democratic Party of Moldova] slate. 
  The department, of course, has protection, and it is not 
weak. Money for its activity is allotted by the International 
Monetary Fund and other foreign investors. Here, true, an 
interesting question arises: How does the IMF use its credit to 
keep afloat a department whose activity is considered illegal in 
the homeland. After all, the republic procuracy approved (and 
not for the first time) a draft of the edict which contains the 
following: "A situation has developed whereby a considerable 
share of state property has been illegally transferred to 
entrepreneurial structures, a channel has been opened for 
illegal use and acquisition of state property, members of labor 
collectives are being deluded regarding the promised shares and 
dividends...." Let me repeat once again that the edict has not 
yet been signed by the president and we do not know whether it 
will be signed at all, but the procuracy has signed it! 
  Measures for eliminating the "situation that has developed" 
/ 
which developed "...on the initiative of the State Department on 
Privatization..."/, [punctuation as published] according to the 
edict, will be severe: forced opening of closed joint-stock 
companies; a ban on the reorganization into joint-stock 
companies with mixed capital of enterprises that are subject to 
privatization; the return to members of labor collectives and 
legal entities of monetary funds previously attracted for 
facilities that are valued at up to 1 billion rubles; the 
introduction of essential changes in the founding documents of 
hundreds of joint-stock companies in order to "return" them to 
the list of state-owned facilities offered for privatization for 
BND [certifications of national wealth] during 1993-1994; the 
declaration of documents of joint-stock companies that have not 
made these changes to be invalid, and so forth. Taken together 
these measures call an abrupt halt to everything that was done 
by the department in the sphere of the creation of joint-stock 
companies and throw the process of privatization back to 1991. 
  Privatization is in danger. All of last year and the 
beginning of this year proceeded under this slogan. They are 
whispering about it in waiting lines, discussing it openly in 
the government, and shouting about it in the department. What 
danger can threaten a cause that has so many supporters? It is 
simply that in the waiting lines, in the government, and in the 
rebellious department there is no common viewpoint either on 
privatization or on the danger that threatens it. We are 
learning patience. The waiting line is not moving--someone must 
leave.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tudor Olaru, deputy chairman of the Agrarian </F>
Democratic Party of Moldova, by A. Korolev; place and date not 
given: "There Are No Secret Lobbyists Among Us..."] 
  [Text] No election platform, no statements or 
promises from party leaders will tell more about the party 
itself than its election slate. Drawing up this slate is 
difficult, painstaking, and not always pleasant work, and it is 
better for the voters not to know all the details of what goes 
on in the kitchen. They are offered the dish already prepared. 
This interview with Tudor Olaru, deputy chairman of the Agrarian 
Democratic Party of Moldova, was prepared before the slate of 
candidate deputies from this party was registered with the 
Central Electoral Commission and published in the newspapers, 
but nobody made any secret of it--at a meeting of the ADPM 
council on 4 January the composition of the slate was discussed 
openly, so there was reason for discussing it. 
  [Korolev] Mr. Olaru, the slate of candidates from your party 
is not very similar to the slate of the Agrarians. Everyone is 
included here, there are even leaders and members of the current 
government. 
  [Olaru] If you have read our party's program attentively you 
will know that its main objective is to achieve real sovereignty 
and independence of Moldova, that is, the construction of a new 
state. Therefore we need not only agricultural specialists but 
also lawyers, economists, practical businessmen, and scientists. 
Some 10 percent of the candidates from the ADPM are lawyers and 
approximately the same number are economists. 
  [Korolev] What was the principle on which the slate was 
formed? 
  [Olaru] The main principle was representation of all rayon 
and city party organizations. This, incidentally, pertains to 
members of government as well: Sangheli was nominated by Riscani 
Rayon, Oleinic--by Balti, Gorincioi--by Chisinau, Kunev--by the 
Bulgarian villages of Taraclia and Ciadir-Lunga rayons. Now it 
is easy to gain points by criticizing the government, but there 
is a proverb: For every one that is beaten there are two that 
are not. Our proposals have also been accepted by people who are 
simply well known in the republic, for example, the chief 
physician of the republic clinical hospital of Moshniaga, the 
vice president of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova Lupascu, 
and Ion Surucanu, who needs no introduction. 
  [Korolev] Are there any journalists among the candidates? 
  [Olaru] Diakov, Angeli...those are the only ones I know of. 
  [Korolev] Mr. Olaru, as soon as the Law "On Elections" was 
adopted, in an interview with our newspaper you gave the name of 
the person who should become prime minister in the new 
government. Rather, he should remain. Have you changed your mind? 
  [Olaru] No, I have not changed it. As before, I think that 
if 
we were to win the elections we should form a government and it 
should be headed by Andrei Sangheli. Dumitru Motpan, as the 
party's leader, should remain in parliament. In general our 
policy with regard to this issue is as follows: Those who are 
elected to parliament will work as deputies of parliament. There 
are also many worthy people in Moldova who are not on any party 
slates. And they must be invited to the government. This does 
not mean that none of our candidates will be ministers, but 
their number will be limited. There will be three or four and no 
more. People are mistaken when they think that when "rushing to 
power" the ADPM will give all ministry portfolios to its own 
deputies just to "advance" the slate and pack the parliament 
with as many of "its own" people as possible. 
  [Korolev] How many votes does the ADPM hope to receive in 
the 
elections? I am interested not in your personal prediction but 
the minimum number of deputy mandates necessary in order to 
uphold the principle of equal representation of all regions of 
Moldova. Because if there are any unpleasant surprises, it could 
happen that Balti could be represented in parliament by several 
deputies from the ADPM while, for example, Singerei or 
Soldandesti--by none. 
  [Olaru] There is no such threshold and therefore, frankly, 
the formation of the lower part of the list did not go 
altogether smoothly. Incidentally, I dare say that this should 
be admitted by all parties. But we want, through our 
representative on the Central Electoral Commission, to make a 
proposal that each party after receiving a certain number of 
positions in parliament decide for itself who should hold them. 
Regardless of where the candidate stands on the slate, first or 
140th. It seems to me that this would be fair. I hope the rest 
of the parties will support us. 
  [Korolev] It is no secret that private entrepreneurial 
structures are very interested in the elections. They are trying 
to insert their "candidates" first on one party slate then on 
another. Has the ADPM received similar proposals? 
  [Olaru] Yes, there have been such proposals, and sometimes 
in 
fairly veiled form. We do not have our own secret service or 
counterintelligence, but we have tried not to give in to 
pressure from the outside. There are no secret mafia lobbyists 
or anyone like that among us. That can be ruled out.

<F P=106> [Interview with I.T. Gutu, first vice president and general </F>
director of the Union of Industrialists of the Republic of 
Moldova, by Ya. Guryevich; place and date not given: "`I Remain 
a Communist, But...'"] 
  [Text] His is the typical biography of a party 
official who has traveled a long route from local Komsomol 
officer to the highest pinnacles of power. The memorable August 
of 1991 found him in the office of second secretary of the 
Communist Party of Moldova Central Committee. Now I.T. Gutu is 
first vice president and general director of the Union of 
Industrialists of the Republic of Moldova with, as might have 
been expected, his own vision of the social and political 
situation in the republic, his own understanding of the problems 
that have risen to confront it, and his own view of a way out of 
the present situation. 
  This is the subject of our discussion. 
  [Guryevich] Does it not seem to you, Ivan Timofeyevich, that 
we have today essentially been driven into a corner, from which 
we can neither get things moving nor extricate ourselves? 
  [Gutu] If we consider the wholesale impoverishment of the 
people, this is not a corner but a dead end, perhaps. But this 
is what was to have been expected, it was this that was forecast 
right from the start, when many decisions and legislative 
instruments were adopted in forced manner, under pressure from 
the street and the period of demonstrations, which led not to 
the appeasement of society but to the even greater 
destabilization of the situation. 
  [Guryevich] But new people, who declared themselves true 
democrats and who knew well what the ordinary people needed, 
came to power at that time.... 
  [Gutu] There were not then nor are there with us now 
democrats in the true sense, unfortunately. Even less can people 
with extremely radical views be such. So we acquired, in fact, a 
new elite, even more avid for power and uncompromisingly brazen, 
inasmuch as it had emerged on the wave of national 
self-awareness, and shamelessly bent on distributive functions 
and the satisfaction of personal, primarily material, ambitions. 
Apartments, country cottages, automobiles, overseas travel--I 
shall not give examples, they are there for all to see. 
  [Guryevich] Well, we assume that the former authorities did 
not short-change themselves in this respect either.... 
  [Gutu] Had this been combined with constructive work, as 
before, but everything moved in the entirely opposite direction. 
What did Mircea Druc and his government do? What in practice 
could they have done? They drove away the skilled personnel, 
destroyed the machinery of state, and engendered an atmosphere 
of violence, lawlessness, national discord, and intolerance in a 
formerly peaceful and materially prosperous republic. Not only 
did they not do anything of substance, they were even powerless 
to offer some in any way constructive program. 
  [Guryevich] Yes, but the acquisition of sovereignty and 
independence and recognition in the United Nations and the CSCE 
and entry into the world community come from that same period.... 
  [Gutu] Of course, these were necessary and very important 
stages of the formation of the young state. The exchange of 
embassies and delegations, treaties.... But real recognition 
comes only via internal stability and the material well-being of 
society. But we have neither stability nor well-being but, in 
addition, the unresolved problems of the South and the eastern 
regions.... We still do not know, incidentally, the true 
inspiration behind both the memorable campaign against the 
South, when bloodshed was avoided only by a miracle, and the 
Bendery tragedy, which cost us hundreds of human lives, 
thousands of devastated futures, and many billions of rubles of 
material damage. We are all still making do with a half-truth.... 
  [Guryevich] You believe, Ivan Timofeyevich, that the new 
governing elite had, aside from elements of populism and 
political intriguing, nothing to its name? And that our main 
scourge today is the absence of professional know-how and 
management skills and incompetence? 
  [Gutu] If we are speaking of the first governments, 
undoubtedly. The material base, which had been created over 
decades, was thoroughly undermined, and highly professional, 
technically equipped industrial outfits partly broke up and 
partly switched to semi-crafts production (if only to 
survive!)--and not only in "defense" either: machine building, 
instrument making, and electronics, without which we could, at 
the very least, still hold on somehow--but also in the 
traditional sectors of vital importance to us--light, food, 
processing. And if today some enterprises are still managing to 
stay afloat, it is only thanks to the inconceivable doggedness 
and self-sacrifice of the corps of directors. 
  [Guryevich] I have to agree, nonetheless--not in defense of 
the present rulers but solely from an aspiration to 
objectivity--were the previous authorities more competent? 
  [Gutu] Without a doubt! 
  [Guryevich] What, then, about the Ribnita metallurgical 
giant, which had still been deprived of a raw material base even 
then? And the Pamyat Ilichu Interkolkhoz Nursery, the "biggest 
in Europe"--whereas the vegetable repositories and processing 
industry were incapable of accepting even one-half of the 
produce cultivated there? And the triumphal laying, to victory 
fanfares, of the canal from Lake Yalpug, into which billions had 
been poured and which, upon inspection, resulted in an 
environmental catastrophe? Not to mention the dozens of not so 
costly but no less odious construction projects, in the capital 
included. 
  [Gutu] It is more appropriate to speak here not of the 
degree 
of competence but, rather, of the volitional methods of 
leadership--after all, scientific potential was always enlisted 
in the preliminary consultations.... 
  [Guryevich] But it was, ultimately, one person who 
decided.... 
  [Gutu] Voluntarism, as a style of leadership, was condemned 
by the party itself.... 
  [Guryevich] Following the ouster or death of the latest 
leader? So even then there was not at the time of decisionmaking 
a whiff of democracy even? 
  [Gutu] Nonetheless, compare if only the authorities with 
which the cities and districts of the republic were endowed at 
that time and today's essentially total anarchy of the official 
structures. Is this not the reason also to some extent for the 
troubles that have come crashing down on our capital--the 
menacing state of the engineering utilities, health care, urban 
mass transit.... Decrees were adopted twice formerly at the top 
level, in the CPSU Central Committee, on the development of 
Chisinau, and they were implemented. But whose business of 
anyone's is this now? Who would venture to forecast what awaits 
the capital's 700,000-strong population in the near future? So I 
would not censure our past indiscriminately--what was positive 
and constructive in it was not that insignificant. Now, on the 
other hand, privatization has been mounted at a forced pace, and 
this will, in my view, produce no appreciable improvement in 
people's lives. This can already be seen clearly in the example 
of services. 
  [Guryevich] Should this be understood to mean, Ivan 
Timofeyevich, that you are opposed to radical reforms in the 
economy altogether? 
  [Gutu] Nothing of the sort, I am opposed to certain methods 
and their forced implementation. I am profoundly convinced that 
small business cannot occupy the predominant place in the 
economy and that the fate of the latter is decided by 
large-scale enterprises. Even to take a look at foreign 
experience, we would be better suited by the Chinese 
method--state regulation with elements of a market economy.... 
  [Guryevich] With the guiding and directing role of the 
Communist Party?... 
  [Gutu] At least they have managed to feed more than 1 
billion 
people and raise national income immeasurably. And on this path 
we could, if not achieve the former level, in the next two or 
three years at least approach it and stabilize the situation. 
For this it is essential, first, that the economy cease to be a 
hostage to policy, second, to restore the broken economic ties 
to the countries of the CIS, and, third, determine precisely 
what kind of industry and what kind of products we need for the 
foreign market, and what kind, for domestic consumption. 
  [Guryevich] Well, the Union of Industrialists holds the 
cards, as they say.... 
  [Gutu] Our union does not possess power functions, it can 
only offer its vision of the present situation and its forecasts 
for the future and the corresponding recommendations. Which, 
generally, is what we have been doing since the recent 
conference of the union. Specifically, we believe that the state 
should display initiative in the organizational restructuring of 
industry and provide for the elaboration and realization of 
sector-by-sector outlines and industrial joint labor in 
multilateral cooperation with Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and 
other countries of the CIS and Europe. We, on the other hand, 
are prepared to help the government in the realization of our 
proposals. 
  [Guryevich] And? 
  [Gutu] I would like to hope that the new government will 
give 
this and our other recommendations due attention. 
  [Guryevich] But if blame for the severance of economic 
relations could be imputed to the former government, this cannot 
be said about the present one. Or, come to that, about the 
president, who signed the documents on entry into the CIS, on 
the formation of the economic space, and so forth. So where does 
the problem lie? 
  [Gutu] Yes, they should be given their due for this. But 
many 
questions remain, and, it seems to me, it would be highly 
appropriate for the deputies, who are intending once again to 
run for the new parliament, to address them now, in the election 
campaign. And not only in economics. It would not be 
inappropriate, I believe, for the new parliament to also 
reconsider certain previous legislative instruments--on the 
national anthem and so forth, in particular. 
  [Guryevich] Well, it remains to be hoped that the new 
parliament and the new government will prove receptive to a 
mutual exchange of ideas and be more decisive in the pursuit of 
a balanced policy. 
  [Gutu] That's what I say: Much will depend on who sits in 
the 
old chairs. The abundance of parties and movements with similar 
programs and the like ambitions of their leaders could seriously 
disorient the electorate. 
  [Guryevich] Have you remained in the Communist Party? 
  [Gutu] I was and remain a Communist. But in a renewed party 
which, together with the modified name (it is now the Party of 
Communists of Moldova), is also jettisoning certain tenets of 
Marxism-Leninism and adopting new, approved methods of political 
activity. 
  [Guryevich] Frankly, it had always seemed to me that by no 
means a secondary role had been made ready for you also in the 
new elite which came to power at the end of the 1980's. But two 
"gaffes," which in the thinking of the "true democrats" damaged 
your image somewhat, made themselves felt, evidently. I refer to 
the summer of 1990, when you, together with the entire party 
upper stratum, appeared at the Zelenyy Theater before a 
thousands-strong meeting. Although, incidentally, as mayor of 
the capital, not a party functionary at that time, you could 
have diplomatically declined. As did Nicolae Tau, while even 
first secretary of the capital's city party committee in those 
days.... 
  [Gutu] It was impossible for me to decline for one reason: 
It 
was I who had the whole time been stirring up the republic's 
party leadership, calling on it to show up at the 
demonstrations, enter into a dialogue with people, and explain 
its position, not sit it out in offices. 
  [Guryevich] Very well, the second "gaffe"--the office of 
secretary of the Communist Party of Moldova Central Committee, 
when the party's affairs were already on very shaky ground? 
  [Gutu] Not long before that the decision had been made in 
Moscow that the republic's party organization would be headed by 
P.K. Lucinschi. It was only by keeping this in mind that I 
agreed: I had known Lucinschi a long time and believed that in a 
team with him something could still be done.... 
  [Guryevich] Now, apparently, there is a Communist Party once 
again, only renewed.... But this party will not take part in the 
parliamentary elections inasmuch as it was not in time to 
register before the start of the campaign. So you will, 
consequently, have to call on your supporters to vote for the 
slates of other parties, will you not? 
  [Gutu] Yes, ahead of us are a congress and the formulation 
and adoption of a program and only then involvement in assertive 
political activity. Meanwhile, we will, indeed, support other 
parties at the elections--those that advocate a strengthening of 
Moldova's independence and sovereignty, an immediate 
normalization of the situation in the South and in the eastern 
regions, the ratification of all economic agreements within the 
framework of the CIS and the conclusion of beneficial bilateral 
treaties with these countries, national referenda on problems 
that are fateful for the state and, most important, an increase 
in our people's prosperity. 
  [Guryevich] And what parties are these? 
  [Gutu] Not all have made their election platforms public as 
yet. But judging by what is already known about their intentions 
and final goals, they are the Agrarian-Democratic and Socialist 
Parties. 
  [Guryevich] And are you not embarrassed by the fact that the 
platform of the Socialist Party, say, is once again interspersed 
with certain decrepit ideological myths--like free housing and 
low rent and free education and health care--although even the 
youngest schoolboys now know that there is in fact nothing that 
is or can be free, that the resources for the so-called 
"freeness," and considerable ones at that, were shamelessly 
taken from the working people themselves.... 
  [Gutu] Yes, some of the wording is, truly, embarrassing. But 
the right to free housing, education, and health care for a 
particular section of the needy population should, indeed, be 
guaranteed by the state. 
  [Guryevich] Our interview is coming to an end, and I will, 
therefore, ask you a question that is by no means new but highly 
popular in such situations: If you could begin everything all 
over again.... 
  [Gutu] I regret nothing, and nothing in my life inspires in 
me feelings of awkwardness or shame.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Boyko, ambassador of Ukraine in </F>
Moldova, by S. Gamova; place and date not given: "The Roots of 
the Mutual Relations Between Moldova and Ukraine Go Back 
Centuries"] 
  [Text] More than 600,000 Ukrainians live in Moldova 
today. This and also being Ukraine's immediate neighbor dictate 
the interest of the people living in our republic in the mutual 
relations of the two states. The interview with Vitaliy Boyko, 
Ukraine's ambassador in Moldova, is about this. 
  [Gamova] Vitaliy Fedorovich, how are Ukraine's relations 
with 
Moldova developing, and what in them is determinative? 
  [Boyko] Moldova is viewed in a strategic sense as a very 
close neighbor with which it is possible to build normal 
friendly relations. Ukraine's position is built on recognition 
of the unity and indivisibility of Moldova's borders. This has 
been repeatedly confirmed by Ukraine President L. Kravchuk. But 
as a very close neighbor, Ukraine is alarmed by the problems 
associated with the Dnestr area conflict. Especially because the 
conflict occurred on the borders with Ukraine, and this speaks 
of possible moral and material losses for us. In addition, every 
seventh resident in Moldova is of Ukrainian origin. Moreover, a 
majority of Ukrainians are residents of the Left Bank. This is a 
feature that we cannot fail to take into account. Therefore, at 
the last meeting in Kiev, Leonid Kravchuk expressed Ukraine's 
intention to promote a settlement of the conflict in the Dnestr 
area. Adhering, as I have already noted, to the principle of the 
unity and indivisibility of Moldova, Ukraine thinks that the 
possibility of allotting special status to the eastern rayons of 
Moldova, with definite guarantees in the event of changes in the 
status of Moldova itself, is a step that could remove the 
existing problems. 
  Since the proclamation of independence of our states, their 
mutual relations are being placed on a legal basis. A treaty on 
good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation between Ukraine 
and Moldova was signed in October 1993. About 30 
intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements on different 
directions of cooperation were concluded on the basis of this 
treaty. It is characteristic that the year 1993 ended with 
another meeting of President Snegur and President Kravchuk in 
Kiev. Documents were signed at it in the sphere of protection of 
the rights of citizens: Ukrainians in Moldova and Moldovans in 
Ukraine. These concern basically social protection, for example, 
of pensioners. Although it would be nice if the number of these 
documents increased, inasmuch as other problems also exist. 
Essentially, there is no state border between Moldova and 
Ukraine, there is an administrative-territorial one. Meanwhile, 
the state border is the sign of an independent state. You know, 
you somehow feel more confident with a neighbor when a boundary 
is drawn between your plot and his. At the Kiev meeting the 
presidents talked about the need to accelerate resolution of 
this question. 
  [Gamova] Customs posts are also a sign of independent 
states... 
  [Boyko] There is a lot of unfavorable criticism of the 
existing customs barriers. Things have developed in such a way 
that there are blood ties connecting the residents of Ukraine 
and Moldova. In this connection, round trips are quite natural. 
In the process of inheritance among citizens of Moldova it can 
happen that their home and vegetable garden are in a Ukrainian 
village. But a person has to pay to transport across the border 
what he has raised in his very own garden--the customs duties 
are such that it is cheaper to buy food products at the market. 
Recently, to officially register a crossing of the Ukrainian 
border, customs charged $5 from each vehicle. This kind of 
$5-customs barrier turned out in fact to be a closing of the 
Ukrainian border. It is true that this measure existed for only 
two weeks; however, it evoked colossal indignation. Errors like 
this cost us a lot, inasmuch as they have a negative effect on 
the assessment of Ukraine. 
  [Gamova] In your opinion, is anything changing in the 
conditions in which the Ukrainian diaspora has to live in 
Moldova? 
  [Boyko] There are some changes for the better in the revival 
of Ukrainian culture and language. I detect in this the policy 
of the president of Moldova and on the whole of the authorities 
of the republic who are trying to create a definite base for the 
future. Ukrainian groups are being created in Moldovan VUZ's 
[higher educational institutions]. The university in the capital 
will prepare elementary grade teachers for Ukrainian schools. 
Two groups have been formed in the Lipkany teachers college for 
the training of educators for Ukrainian kindergartens. According 
to the joint agreement of ministries that are in charge of 
questions of education, a student exchange is being conducted, 
and young boys and girls of Ukrainian nationality from Moldova 
can receive an education in Ukraine, and vice versa. State 
policy in Moldova is directed at the creation of conditions for 
the revival of national cultures. This is also indicated by 
support at government level of Ukrainian cultural societies in 
Moldova. 
  [Gamova] Are requests addressed to you at the embassy 
concerning the granting of Ukrainian citizenship? 
  [Boyko] There are such requests. But the fact is that the 
laws of Ukraine do not envision granting Ukrainian citizenship 
to persons who live outside its borders. Only those who have 
moved to a permanent place of residence in Ukrainian cities and 
villages can become citizens of Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, our legislation permits dual citizenship on the 
basis of intergovernmental agreements. Except for Tajikistan, 
this practice as such does not exist in the CIS. As a lawyer, I 
am interested, for example, in what the basis is for such an 
agreement between Russia and Tajikistan. This question is being 
studied at the expert level in Ukraine and Russia. In the 
future, it can also come up against the background of our 
relations with Moldova, and what is meant here is the 
development of a special interstate agreement. Although numerous 
questions crop up here. Including also the question of 
obligations with respect to the state whose citizenship a person 
is assuming. In dual citizenship, perhaps, only his rights are 
being looked into. 
  Nevertheless, the statement of the issue of dual citizenship 
itself is important, if at least because requests regarding 
adoption of Ukrainian citizenship are numerous. They are 
especially being looked at in the Dnestr area and the rayons 
bordering Ukraine. The residents of these rayons, referring to 
the fact that until 1940 they were in the structure of Ukraine, 
are insisting on confirmation of their Ukrainian citizenship, 
although, however, citizenship of Ukraine as such did not exist 
before 1940. 
  [Gamova] What would you wish for the readers of 
KISHINEVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI in the New Year? 
  [Boyko] Returning to the meeting of the presidents of 
Moldova 
and Ukraine, I would wish for the results of the agreements 
achieved in it to be filled with a good deal of substance. So 
that their implementation will proceed for the good of both the 
Ukrainian and Moldovan people. 
  For the readers of your newspaper--happiness, health, and 
abundant peace in the New Year.

<F P=106> [Article by Valter Udam: "In Defense of Farm Economy and the </F>
Farm Law"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Farmer and the Status Quo </H5>
  Last December marked five years from the time the farm law 
was passed. Based on that law, close to 10,000 farms have 
emerged by now. Part of them are already viable, because they 
have been able to acquire the necessary agricultural and farm 
technology, and construct or renovate their production 
structures. The first cows raised on one's own farm are giving 
milk already. In agriculture, the production cycle is long, and 
it usually takes five to six years before any capital can be 
accumulated to expand production. 
  Five years ago, it was possible to start out with a 
relatively small amount of initial capital. A new tractor cost 
3,000 to 5,000 rubles, one could also buy used equipment 
cheaper, or rent it from the collectives. Building materials and 
other necessities could also be acquired cheaper. 
  Currently, the cost of a tractor is between 50,000 and 
60,000 
kroons, representing some 10 years of milk money for an average 
farmer. But what about production costs and upkeep of the 
family? The reader might suggest taking a loan. But, in that 
case, people in the cities could also start taking out loans to 
feed their families? The current sales prices of agricultural 
products do not cover expenses incurred for their production, 
not to mention the interest on the loan. This is why farmers are 
reluctant to take out loans, even though they are available in 
limited amounts. Our state and our people are not able to pay 
the farmer a fair price for his production. This is what has 
snagged the creation of farms. 
  It is not hard to foresee that this year, too, will bring a 
decrease in both the acreage planted and in productivity. Much 
of the fall plowing was neglected, and the acreage of winter 
grain amounted to about one third of that planted in previous 
years. A good portion of that, too, will probably have to be 
plowed under in the spring because the first shoots were not 
viable. Farmers and cooperatives based on collectives did not 
have enough money last fall to buy fuel for hauling organic 
fertilizers out to the fields, not to mention buying any 
mineral-based fertilizers. This is why, over the next few years, 
the fertility of the soil is bound to go down to the point where 
money made from the sale of agricultural products no longer 
covers the cost of tilling the soil. But, unfortunately, one 
cannot get something out of nothing! 
<H5>  Birth of the Farm Law and Its Current Status </H5>
  Five years ago when the farm law was passed, none of us 
believed that we could reach such absurdity. Back then, I was 
chairman of the Supreme Council agricultural complex commission 
or the only paid delegate to the council. This is why I had an 
opportunity to get involved in formulating legislative measures 
dealing with agriculture. Preparations for the farm law took 
more than half a year, it was passed after its third reading. 
Participating in this work, besides commission members (most of 
them specialists in agriculture) and members of the expert group 
(these numbered 32, most of them scientists), were also actual 
farmers--farm operators as well as representatives of 
collectives; well-known legal professionals of our republic, and 
representatives of government agencies. The bill of the farm law 
was up for public discussion. In the course of this work, our 
commission received more than 200 corrections and proposals. 
  Lately, for almost a year now, there have been efforts to 
wipe out all the work that was done back then, and leave 
agriculture, along with the farmer, without any protection. In 
fact, the farm law was declared void when the law to 
implement property rights was passed by Riigikogu 
[Estonia's parliament] recently. Up until now, it had been the 
only measure regulating all the problems dealing with the 
development of agriculture: Relations between state and local 
authorities, premises of economic and financial activity, issues 
linked to continuity of ownership, and much more. 
  According to the farm law, the founder of the farm was free 
of all taxation for the first five years. This is of special 
importance because agriculture is known for its slow turnover of 
capital and its long production cycle, the initial investment 
for starting a farm will not turn any profit for the first five 
years. This is the minimum amount of time it takes to cover 
direct production costs, feed one's family, and put aside money 
for the instalment and interest payments on the bank loans. 
  In the days of the independent Republic of Estonia, after 
the 
land reform, farmers were given long-term, low interest loans 
extended over 50 years, with payments starting five years after 
the loan was received. When formulating the farm law, we drew 
extensively on the legislation and experiences garnered from 
that era. Now, both Riigikogu and the government want to place 
the farmer right in the middle of an unregulated and untamed 
market economy. But agriculture, by its very nature, cannot 
compete with other sectors of the national economy without help 
from the state. 
  Naturally, we could not pass an ideal farm law five years 
ago, and we could not do it now. Life has a way of coming up 
with new problems constantly. During Estonia's republican era, 
over 200 corrections and amendments were added to legislation in 
the area of agriculture over a 20-year period. Ministers of 
agriculture were also changed frequently, but agricultural 
leadership and continuity of production were maintained through 
the most difficult of years. 
  Agriculture and farmers are in for some extremely difficult 
years. Those becoming landowners these days are predominantly 
city folk who have neither the will nor the ability to start a 
farm in the given situation. They lack both the mental and the 
material basis, and the experience that, in the older days, was 
passed on in the farm setting as part of family continuity. This 
is why land reform will not be completed in the years to come, 
but will go on for some time. The land will be changing its 
owners quite a few times before agriculture will really get 
going. By that, I am referring primarily to agriculture dealing 
with commercial production. You can find cottagers and hobby 
farmers in agriculturally developed countries, too, but these 
are not involved in solving the problems linked to the 
production of agricultural products. 
  Right now, it is not hard to foresee that prices of 
agricultural products on the world market will be going up in 
the years to come. Considering our standard of living, they are 
high already. In response to pressure from the United States, 
agricultural subsidies will be reduced by up to 20 percent over 
the next six years. Price increases will also be helped along by 
the reduction of subsidies to the export of agricultural 
products. People in wealthy countries can afford to pay for all 
that, but we are in for trouble. 
  Unfortunately, our politicians and our government could not, 
and did not even want to foresee this kind of development. Now, 
that agriculture is largely in shambles (which is the best word 
to describe it), there are some attempts to admit it, but it is 
too late already. I could not tell what we should be doing. I 
would like to emphasize, however, that the farm law should be 
left in force, with changes to be made as the situation 
warrants, and its provisions made to correspond to those of the 
property right law.

<F P=106> [Article by ulo Kulm: "Economists Projected the </F>
Future"] 
  [Text] 
  The Association of Economists met in Tallinn on 
Thursday. The current state of the economy was discussed and 
projections made for the future. 
  A longer presentation dealing with the current state of 
Estonia's economy and its future was made by Teet Rajasalu, 
science director of the Economic Institute. In his opinion our 
economy has reached a balance and become more demand-oriented. 
Exports should increase by the end of the year: They could go up 
to 14-15 billion kroons or, combined with the export of 
services, up to 20 billion kroons. 
  Improvement will derive mostly from choices now available to 
people between buying domestic or imported products. Income 
should also be going up for low- and medium-level wage earners, 
which should liven up the economy even further. 
  In his examination of different sectors of the economy, 
Rajasalu projected a continuing decline of agriculture. The 
industry as a whole, however, could exceed last year's levels by 
the end of 1994. Even though hauling volumes tend to shrink, 
transportation by sea, for one, is said to be doing well. The 
export of sea-related services makes a difference in maintaining 
Estonia's balance of payments. It is hoped that the export of 
building services will also increase. 
  T. Rajasalu thinks that the number of unemployed will also 
go 
up this year, but not significantly--roughly by 10,000. 
Inflation is continuing and, because of it, wages should also be 
going up. Average wage should be up to 1,800 kroons a month by 
the end of the year. 
  Alari Purju of the forecasting institute compared what is 
going on in Estonia to reforms carried out in Eastern Europe. 
According to him, reforms have gone off best in the Czech 
Republic, in Poland the instability is greater. The gross 
product has gone down in all of the reforming countries. 
  Also participating in the discussions were economists from 
the economic ministry, Bank of Estonia, the Economic Forecasting 
Institute and the University of Tartu.

<F P=106> [Staff article: "Will We Be Buying Electricity From Abroad </F>
10 Years From Now?"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  Power Plants Hopelessly Outdated </H6>
  The condition of Estonia's energy economy and energy 
production became somewhat obscured and aggravated after Estonia 
became independent. If most of the basic equipment, materials, 
fuels and know-how are obtained at world-market prices, then 
production (electric energy) is being sold below world market 
prices, judging by the talk about the overall poverty of the 
population. 
  Consumption of electricity is bound to go up in Estonia, as 
general economic development continues. It is possible to 
sustain this consumption with production from two big power 
plants. The currently operating power plants Eesti Elektrijaam 
[Estonian Electric Plant] and Balti Elektrijaam [Baltic Electric 
Plant] are hopelessly outdated. This has been confirmed by 
management team members of these plants, and proven by the study 
titled 'Analysis and Directions for the Development of Estonia's 
Energy Sector' conducted by the Development Bureau for 
Energetics. It is high time to start thinking about renovating 
or replacing these power plants, if our planning calls for 
meeting all of Estonia's energy needs domestically. 
<H5>  Colossal Sums Necessary for Renovation </H5>
  Amounts required for renovation, not to mention those 
required for replacement, run into billions of kroons. Anatoli 
Paal, director of the Baltic Power Plant has said (see T. 
Ojala's article 'Baltic Power Plant Is Fit For a Museum' in 
aRIPaEV, November 22, 1993) that bringing the 
capacity 
to generate one-kilowatt up to contemporary standards would cost 
$700. The projected capacity of the Baltic Power Plant, at which 
the equipment would work at its most economical level, is 1,435 
MW. Thus, the amount required for a complete overhaul at this 
plant is $1,005.5 million or 14 billion kroons at the current 
exchange rates. 
  If overhaul is not started over the next few years, we will 
be faced with a situation at the turn of the century where 
electricity would have to be imported from the neighboring 
countries. Can Estonia come up with the amount required for 
overhauling the Baltic Power Plant. 
  The study mentioned recommends that electric energy 
production based on oil-shale be continued as long as possible, 
because that will enable us to put off investing in in new 
generating capacities. 
<H5>  Electricity From Coal or Oil Shale? </H5>
  Producing electricity out of oil shale has its drawbacks. 
The 
energy content of oil shale is three times smaller than that of 
coal. Consequently, for purposes of energy production, the price 
of one tonne of oil shale should also be three times lower than 
the corresponding price of coal on the world market. However, 
from the mining point of view, this difference is not 
three-fold. In fact, there is no difference. 
  Should Estonia still plan to produce its electricity largely 
out of oil shale 10 years from now, it could do so only if oil 
shale miners did not demand the same wage as coal miners, or if 
tax payers picked up the wage difference in the form of state 
subsidies. 
<H5>  Low Cost of Electricity Makes Consumer Smug </H5>
  It is the job of the state to set down the rules of the 
game, 
and that also applies to the area of energy. It seems strange 
however that, in setting down the rules, the state should 
deliberately put the enterprise it owns in a difficult 
situation. If, in the world of commerce, those buying in 
quantities get their merchandise cheaper than retail customers 
then, in energy sales, for some unknown reason, things work the 
other way around. 
  This could not be explained by government attempts to help 
those struggling because, ultimately, the higher cost of 
electricity to industrial enterprises is paid for by the 
consumer. 
  The low price of electricity is conducive to consumer 
smugness and to taking advantage of the situation. 
  The most curious example comes from the small islands, where 
electricity is produced by diesel generators. The production of 
energy in the islands is significantly more costly than it is on 
mainland. In accordance with government resolutions, however, 
users on these islands pay the same rates as people on mainland. 
If some mainlander should decide to use electricity for heat, 
because it is cheaper and more convenient to use than other 
sources of heat, the state's interests are not significantly 
harmed, whereas the same behavior by someone on a small island 
would the same damage tens of times over.

<F P=106> [Article by Aap Tanav: "Niitenberg Not Afraid of </F>
 Nuclear 
Plants"] 
<H6>  The Daughter of Estonia's Energy Minister Arvo Niitenberg Is 
Involved In Liquidating Accidents at Nuclear Plants </H6>
  [Text] 
  "I have been telling my Western colleagues that had 
they had a steep price hike like we had in Estonia, they would 
have had rioting in the streets," says energy minister Arvo 
Niitenberg smugly, as he recalls the economic crisis of the 70's 
in the United States. At that time, Americans raised the price 
of a liter of gasoline by 10 cents, and there were incidents of 
shooting at gas stations. Estonia's energetics has survived a 
major price shock over the past two years. Coal, heating oil, 
natural gas, diesel fuel and gasoline have been brought to world 
market prices. "Oil shale and electricity are not at world 
market prices," says Niitenberg, satisfied that Estonia has 
moved into world economy. The price of gasoline in Estonia and 
the world price of unprocessed crude are now linked. 
  One dramatic example of relentlessly rising prices is the 
754-time jump in the price of natural gas, as compared to the 
Soviet era. The minister believes that our energy policy which, 
in its formative stages, drew praise from its teachers like the 
World Bank, the European Bank of Development and Reconstruction, 
and other organizations, will make Estonia stronger in the 
future. The days of wasting cheap energy are over. 
<H5>  No More Sudden Price Hikes </H5>
  "As is happening elsewhere, the price of energy in Estonia 
will still be going up, but I don't foresee any sudden jumps," 
says Niitenberg and finds that the price of electricity, for 
example, is favorably low, compared to some of our neighbors. He 
does not believe that the price of electricity will ever go up 
to Finland's level (5 times higher than ours), and that Estonia 
will always have an advantage. Electricity is unnaturally cheap 
in Russia but, compared to other neighboring states, Estonian 
producers enjoy a certain advantage. 
  While the consumption of electricity has been going up 
lately, the demand for liquid fuel has been dropping. During 
1993, only 600,000 tonnes of heating oil were consumed, compared 
to its previous consumption levels of up to 1,600,000 tonnes a 
year. 
  "Part of that difference is attributable to user economy, 
the 
rest to a general economic decline. I believe we can increase 
production without drastically increasing the demand for energy. 
We have to reduce the energy loss that currently amounts to 
roughly one third of the total. If that part of the energy could 
be used to develop the economy, energy expenditures would not 
have to go up for the time being," Niitenberg says. As an 
example, he cites Denmark, where energy consumption goes up by 
less than 1 percent, yet the economy is developing at a much 
faster rate. This is the result of energy conservation programs. 
The Danes have made a transition to more modern heating systems, 
they have financing. Estonia, by contrast, is plagued by lack of 
capital. 
<H5>  The Proportion of Domestic Fuel Is Small </H5>
  "For the development of energetics, we have received loans 
from the European Community totaling 76.7 million Estonian 
kroons. With that money, more than 140 energy-related projects 
have been carried out in different parts of Estonia. These have 
been mostly small plants for local parish use, installed to make 
a transition to domestic fuel, and to reduce energy loss," 
Niitenberg says. 
  The proportion of domestic fuel sources is currently not as 
great in Estonia as it is in our neighboring countries. Timber 
and peat provide 3.5 percent of the necessary energy. In the 
Nordic countries, this share is roughly 7 percent; in Finland 
between 12 and 13 percent. 
  "It would be possible to increase the share of timber and 
peat to 10 percent. It is interesting to note that, even though 
Estonia imports much of its fuel, close to 70 percent of the 
energy is obtained locally. In this respect we are much better 
off than Latvia or Lithuania. We have oil shale, electricity, 
timber and peat, only liquid fuel and natural gas are brought 
in," Niitenberg says. 
<H5>  Estonia Needs an Explosives Plant </H5>
  Out of the production cost for oil shale, one third goes for 
explosives which, for the time being, are still coming from our 
eastern neighbors. Prices of explosives and fuses have gone up 
and that, in turn, has jacked up the price of oil shale. Eesti 
Polevkivi [Estonian Oil Shale] is in the process of 
negotiating with a Swedish and a German firm for putting up an 
explosives plant in Estonia, specifically for mining. Depending 
on technology, this will require an investment of roughly $5 to 
$10 million. A study is being conducted to show how fast the 
plant can pay for itself. 
  "Last year, 13.5 million tonnes of oil shale were produced 
in 
Estonia, and I cannot see that volume going down in the near 
future. We can tell potential foreign buyers that the market is 
stable, and give them certain guarantees," Niitenberg thinks. 
<H5>  Send Us Pressure Pipe, Not Experts </H5>
  Both firms are interested, but are still busy looking for 
marketing possibilities in other nearby regions. Niitenberg 
thinks there are certain advantages to investing in Estonia. It 
is not like dealing with the Third World countries, who cannot 
manage on their own. We have technical know-how and an 
industrial infra-structure. All we need is modern technology. 
  "In my dealings with foreigners, I have had to repeat, time 
and again, please believe me, we also have experts. We would 
rather have 300 meters of pressure pipe than seven experts," 
says Niitenberg, convinced that Estonia can offer some excellent 
specialists in the area of energetics. In addition to capital, 
we also lack the skill of organizing the work. 
<H5>  A Strategic Reserve Would Be Necessary </H5>
  Lack of capital also stands in the way of creating a 
strategic reserve of fuel. Niitenberg is a believer in having 
strategic reserves, the only question being what is the most 
effective way of using the financial resources available. For 
Estonia to to maintain a three-month reserve of liquid fuel, 
would tie up $300 to $400 million. 
  "Estonia is not rich enough to let such amounts sit idle. 
First, a decision needs to be made how much of a reserve should 
be maintained. This presumes that we know what we want to be 
insured against. We have the facilities for storing liquid fuel, 
but not for natural gas, 100 percent of which comes in from 
Russia. Putting those up would take an extremely large 
investment, the closest usable storage facilities are located in 
Latvia," Niitenberg says, adding that the question of strategic 
reserves has been discussed in government and has been assigned 
to the working group of the Economic Ministry. The problem is 
wider in scope, and includes the areas of medicine, food and 
other such. 
<H5>  Refining Plant To Cost $1 Billion </H5>
  Canada, where Niitenberg worked for many years in leading 
positions within the energy system, had a relatively low level 
of reserves. Emphasis was placed on infra-structure, making sure 
that fuel could be moved immediately whenever needed. The 
reserves of liquid fuel were distributed between big oil 
companies, with the state keeping track of how fast some company 
or other could obtain a certain quantity of fuel. Most of the 
responsibility was borne by Petro Canada, a company similar to 
our Eesti Kutus [Estonian Fuel]. There is always the 
question: Can the state place an obligation on a private company? 
  "In case of a possible crisis, we have two choices. Either 
we 
have barrels stored somewhere, or we have a firm plan for how to 
transport the necessary amount of fuel from some refining plant 
in Denmark or Poland to Estonia within three days. Putting up 
our own plant would require a capital outlay of $800 to $900 
million, whereas transportation, storage and other support 
services for import have improved significantly as of late. 
  "In Canada, I dealt with electricity that could not be kept 
in reserve. For unexpected situations, alternatives had to be 
found," Niitenberg says. 
<H5>  A Nuclear Plant Does Not Have To Be Hazardous </H5>
  Among specialists, there has also been talk about putting up 
a nuclear power plant in Estonia. Speaking of money, Niitenberg 
volunteered the cost of the Darlington nuclear power plant as an 
example. Ontario Hydro, the Canadian company where Niitenberg 
worked before coming to Estonia, and where he still has a 
position waiting for him, invested 14 billion Canadian dollars 
in building this 3,600 MW capacity power plant. This project, 
designed for an operating life of 30 to 40 years, is not 
expected to turn a profit for the first 10 years. 
  "The possibility of putting up a nuclear power plant should 
be analyzed, above all, from an economic point of view. If the 
potential profit is a mere two cents per kilowatt, it will 
obviously not be worth the risk. It would be a completely 
different situation, however, if the nuclear plant would enable 
us to produce electricity at half the previous cost. One of the 
biggest burdens imaginable is a nuclear plant that does not work 
efficiently or does not have a sufficient load. However, atomic 
power plants can turn out to be extremely profitable. We should 
not dismiss any of the alternatives on simply emotional grounds, 
even though we know what happened at Chernobyl and what is going 
on in Paldiski, where the biggest danger is over by now," says 
Niitenberg, who was in charge of 20 nuclear power plants in 
Canada, and who has a daughter involved in liquidating nuclear 
power plant accidents. 
  "As long as everything is well organized, this field is not 
as dangerous as it is thought to be. If that were not so, I 
would not have allowed my daughter to work in this field. It is 
significant that, in accordance with international agreements, 
information should be disclosed on any accident so that 
appropriate conclusions could be drawn by nuclear energy 
specialists in neighboring countries and throughout the world. 
At Chernobyl, this agreement was violated," Niitenberg explained. 
<H5>  Future Will Bring New Solutions </H5>
  Niitenberg thinks that this issue will not come up on 
Estonia's agenda before the year 2000, for sure, and that it 
will take a political decision, in principle, either by 
politicians or by a referendum. 
  As far as the future of energetics for the whole world goes, 
Niitenberg does not deign offer anything specific. 
  "If I knew the solution, I would become a very rich man," he 
laughs and thinks that bio-energetics will develop, for sure. 
Also feasible is the so-called fusion method, which 
is the next step in harnessing nuclear energy, based on the 
ability of heavy hydrogen isotopes to combine into helium at 
extremely high temperatures, yielding energy from the neutron 
thus released. 
  To the question about current fuel reserves and how long 
they 
will last, Niitenberg replies with another question: For what 
kind of money? Canada has supposedly more crude oil than all 
Arab countries combined but, due to natural conditions, pumping 
it out would cost 30 times more than the current norm.

<F P=106> [Business desk article: "Cost of Living Up 4.1 Percent in </F>
December"] 
  [Text] 
  Prices went up relatively rapidly toward the end of 
last year--the 4-percent increase in the consumer price index 
for November gained an additional one tenth in December. 
  That represented a 5.1 percent increase in the price of 
food items (including alcoholic beverages and tobacco products), 
a 1 percent increase in the price of manufactured goods, and a 
6.3 percent increase in the price of services, compared to 
November. 
  By categories reported, prices went down, by 1.3 
percent, only for expenditures linked to leisure time activities. 
  The overall annual price increase for consumer goods 
and services was 35.6 percent. 
  Looking at the increase in the consumer price index for the 
last month of the year by categories reported, and considering 
their relative share of the market basket, it turns out that the 
significant factors for the rise in the cost of living are 
different from those seen in the diagram. 
  Causing the biggest jump--1.16 percent--in the overall price 
index were expenditures linked to housing. Egg prices, up almost 
by one third, added 0.48 percent to the index, and price 
increases for meat and meat products another 0.44 percent. 
Clothing and footwear brought the overall index up by 0.42 
percent, flour, flour products and cereals by 0.39 percent, 
fruits and vegetables by 0.35 percent, transportation and 
communications services by 0.31 percent, and milk by 0.28 
percent. Other categories reported had less of an impact on 
increasing the price index.

  Despite the major jump in prices that occurred during the 
last months of the year, one can say that inflation was 
controlled quite successfully for the year of 1993. Experts have 
projected this year's level to be between 20 and 25 percent. 
Compared to countries with strong economies, this growth is 
rather large, of course, but the increase rate for the cost of 
living will not start coming down until most of the basic prices 
have become compatible with those of the neighboring countries. 
Naturally, the rate of price increases should not exceed the 
population's ability to pay.

Pauls Karnups, member of Saeima: "The Foreigner Problem"] 
  [Text] The central databank of the Register of 
Residents summarized data on 2,410,763 residents, i.e. on 97.9 
percent of individuals included in the initial registration. 
  Discussions concerning the law on citizenship and the status 
of foreigners in Latvia, which remains undetermined, are 
continuing in Latvia. Various opinions and evaluations could be 
better substantiated if political workers and the interested 
parties had a better knowledge of the actual situation. Data of 
the Register of Residents, which is currently being summarized 
in a centralized databank, will be indispensable in a future 
determination of the actual situation. Even though this data is 
not yet absolutely precise, inasmuch as it has not been 
qualified and verified, it can, however, already be used in 
political, economic, social, and cultural life. 
  At present the Register of Residents lists 2,462,196 
individuals. According to data of the State Committee on 
Statistics 2,566,000 persons lived in Latvia at the start of 
1994. Consequently 96 percent of the residents were registered. 
The initial registration of residents has remained unchanged for 
several months. This makes it possible to believe that the 
initial registration can now be considered as being complete. 
  As commonly known, the Register of Residents does not 
include 
Russian military personnel on active duty and members of their 
families. Unfortunately the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration Affairs is thus far unable to provide precise 
information on how many of these people there are. Some 29,618 
temporary residence permits have now been issued, which amounts 
to 1.2 percent of the total population of Latvia. 
  It is clearly necessary to also take into account the fact 
that there are people who are consciously avoiding registration 
or doing so because of the pressure of circumstances. They are 
individuals, including Letts, who do not register because they 
were on active duty in the Soviet army and are now receiving a 
pension from Russia. 
  It is understandable that the Register of Residents is being 
ignored by a large number of those military personnel who were 
discharged and are getting a pension from Russia. The total 
number of such individuals may reach 70,000, or 2.7 percent of 
the Latvian population. It is likewise not known what number of 
citizens of Russia residing in Latvia have registered with the 
Register of Residents. Finally, those who intend to leave Latvia 
in the immediate or distant future are attempting to circumvent 
the Register of Residents. In 1993 the migratory balance (the 
difference between those arriving and those departing) amounted 
to 28,000 people. That is considerably less than in 1992 when 
the migratory balance came to 47,200. As commonly known in 1991 
that balance constituted 11,200 persons. 
  The central databank of the Register of Residents summarized 
data on 2,410,763 residents, i.e. on 97.9 percent of individuals 
covered in the initial registration. A more detailed analysis of 
this data is given below. 
<H5>  Citizens </H5>
  Some 71.4 percent or 1,720,302 persons of those included in 
the databank are citizens of the Latvian Republic. As commonly 
known those who held the citizenship of the Latvian Republic 
prior to 17 June 1940 and their descendants are citizens of the 
Latvian Republic. Consequently after registering with the 
Register of Residents it is possible to become a citizen of the 
Latvian Republic also if only one of the parents is a citizen of 
the Latvian Republic. 
  A total of 432,200 citizens of Latvia live in Riga, 453,300 
in Vidzeme, 319,200 in Latgale, 242,900 in Kurzeme, and 272,600 
in Zemgale, while in cities like Jurmala there are 33,600 
citizens, in Liepaja--47,700 citizens, and in Daugavpils-- 
72,300 citizens. 
  Both parents of 1,309,500 (71.1 percent) of the Latvian 
citizens hold Latvian citizenship. In Riga there are 312,400 
(72.3 percent) such persons, 357,700 (78.9 percent) in Vidzeme, 
228,600 (71.6 percent) in Latgale, 196,800 (81.0 percent) in 
Kurzeme, 213,900 (78.5 percent) in Zemgale, 21,000 (62.5 
percent) in Jurmala, 38,200 (80.1 percent) in Liepaja, and 
47,800 (66.1 percent) in Daugavpils. There are less than 60 
percent of such citizens in the city of Rezekne, 50.3 percent in 
the Rezekne Rayon and 59.7 percent in Gulbene Rayon. 
  Some 135,000 individuals (7.9 percent of the total number of 
citizens of the Latvian Republic) received citizenship on their 
maternal side. In Riga there are 52,700 such persons (12.2 
percent of the citizens of the Latvian Republic living in Riga). 
  A total of 114,100 persons (6.6 percent) received 
citizenship 
on their paternal side. In Riga--39,400 (9.1 percent). 
  As we can see more people obtained citizenship on their 
maternal side than on the paternal side. This is apparently 
explained by the fact that women enter into mixed marriages more 
frequently than men, as a result of which the probability of 
them marrying foreigners increases. It is likewise necessary to 
take into account the fact that the specific share of women in 
the population of Latvia is higher than that of men. 
  In addition to that 101,900 individuals (5.9 percent of 
citizens of the Latvian Republic) received citizenship on their 
maternal side without indication of the father's citizenship. 
The same applies to 22,600 (1.3 percent) of the citizens of the 
Latvian Republic who obtained citizenship on the paternal side 
without an indication of the mother's citizenship. 
  As commonly known, in accordance with the terminology of the 
Register of Residents those foreigners who are not citizens of 
Latvia and have a permanent residence permit in Latvia are 
registered as former citizens of the USSR in the initial 
registration. 
  In the case of some of those registered, as already 
mentioned, the citizenship of the parents is not mentioned. In 
individual cases the citizenship of the parents may truly be 
unknown, for instance, in the case of elderly people who 
received citizenship of the Latvian state in the first years of 
its existence, the citizenship of whose parents has not been 
determined. 
<H5>  Foreigners </H5>
  A total of 690,461 persons (28.6 percent of those in the 
databank) are foreigners, or, in other words, residents of 
Latvia who are not citizens of the Latvian Republic. In the case 
of 634,000 of them neither the father nor the mother are 
citizens of the Latvian Republic. For the remainder the 
citizenship of either the father or the mother or of both 
parents is not indicated. 
  Most of the foreigners consist of citizens of the USSR who 
entered Latvia illegally during the years of occupation. But 
they are not the only ones. The number of foreigners is also 
supplemented by Letts who returned to Latvia (most often from 
Russia) and in accordance with the existing law on citizenship 
are not citizens of the Latvian Republic. 
  Their number totals 22,031. It is possible that there may be 
more of them inasmuch as during Stalinist times as well as 
subsequently, some of the Russian Letts became "Russians" 
(according to passport entry) even though they consider 
themselves to be Letts. 
  In addition to that the category of foreigners includes 
Polish and Lithuanian agricultural workers, who entered Latvia 
legally before the war and have lived here all of these years, 
as well as their descendants. 
  Some 466,600 (67.6 percent) of the foreigners entered Latvia 
from some other country, most from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, 
while 223,900 (32.4 percent) of the foreigners were born in 
Latvia. Fifty percent of the foreigners born in Latvia were born 
in Riga. 
  During the occupation 9,800 persons on the average entered 
Latvia every year and remained living here. The greatest influx 
of foreigners into Latvia took place in 1946 (11,950), 1947 
(11,500), 1960 (11,750), 1961 (11,200) and 1973 (10,730). It is 
characteristic that in 1957, 1958, and 1959 the number of those 
who arrived (and those who stayed) is smaller than in 1956, 
while in 1960 that index again showed a sharp increase. Those 
who are presently "heroically" reprimanding E. Berklavs should 
give some thought to the reason for that phenomenon. 
  Some 337,200 foreigners, which comes to 48.8 percent of 
their 
total number in Latvia, live in Riga. 
  Most of the foreigners wish to obtain citizenship of the 
Latvian state. It is characteristic that Latvian citizenship is 
most often desired by those foreigners who came here and not by 
those born here.

  Analysis of data from the Register of Residents indicates 
that the foreigner problem is actually a "matter" facing Riga. 
There the share of foreigners is 43.8 percent. The problem is 
particularly acute in the Kurzeme suburb where the share of 
foreigners amounts to 51.2 percent. The share of foreigners, 
however, does not exceed 25 percent in any of the krays of 
Latvia--Kurzeme, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale. 
  Naturally, if we study separate data on citizens of the 
Latvian Republic and foreigners by electoral districts, it will 
turn out that, as anticipated, the foreigner problem is also a 
problem in the largest cities of Latvia. At Liepaja, for 
instance the share of foreigners comprises 49.0 percent, in 
Daugavpils--37.9 percent, in Jurmala--36.6 percent, in Yelgava 
(including the rayon)--34.4 percent, in Ventspils (including the 
rayon)--31.7 percent, and in the Riga Rayon--27.5 percent. At 
the same time the smallest share of foreigners is in the Talsi 
Rayon--55.6 percent, the Madona Rayon--7.0 percent, the Kuldiga 
Rayon--7.2 percent, the Balvi Rayon--8.0 percent, the Preyli 
Rayon--8.9 percent, the Aluksne Rayon--9.2 percent, the Gulbene 
Rayon--9.0 percent, and in the Liepaja Rayon--9.9 percent. In 
all of the other rayons the share of foreigners exceeds 10 
percent. In Zemgale there is not a single rayon where the share 
of foreigners is less than 10 percent. 
  Cited below is a survey of the largest groups of citizens of 
the Latvian Republic and foreigners and their distribution by 
nationality.

  Virtually all of the Livonians living in Latvia are citizens

Estonians--45.5 percent, Jews--45.1 percent, Russians--38.5 
percent, Germans--26.0 percent, Lithuanians--21.2 percent, 
Belarusians--19.8 percent, Armenians--12.6 percent, and 
Ukrainians--6.2 percent. The overall share of citizens of the 
Latvian Republic among Ukrainians and Armenians is rather low 
for the reason that they are not historical national groups in 
Latvia. The same can also be said about Tatars whose overall 
number totals 3,200 individuals with a 95.5 percent share of 
foreigners. 
  The centralized databank has not yet provided information on 
the national composition of krays and rayons of Latvia. If such 
data is obtained, along with information on the composition of 
citizens and foreigners in each district and city, that will 
make it possible to work out naturalization tactics for each 
kray and city of Latvia in accordance with the interests of 
Letts and citizens of the Latvian Republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Rita Naseniece: "Security and its Security"] </F>
  [Text] The scandal in the Vidzeme borough [of Riga] 
was so loud that it obscured a law concerning law enforcement 
activities which was adopted in complete quiet and which ignores 
espionage rules (which will sooner or later be adopted), but 
which also places on the agenda a question about the service's 
secrets or the question of protecting secrets. 
  The affair with the energetic Mr. Rucs, who in moving 
naivete, with the assistance of the municipal police, latched 
onto the withdrawal of the Russian army, which could have become 
the final toll for the Latvia's independence, but which in its 
essence is only evident in the consequences of the poverty of 
the state security system. 
  "We have a lot of spying, 
  and enough information, but analysis and systematization are 
limping along, and therefore it is not clear what each security 
service may and may not do," is the way one Saeima deputy 
characterized the situation. 
  Right now Latvia has been taken over by a spy mania and not 
without cause. A broad spectrum of security organizations have 
been established, which actively participate in intelligence. We 
can divide them into three large, "strongest" groups, of which 
only one would include state institutions. First of all, 
espionage is a criminal method for gathering information and 
includes with it qualitative analytical and systematization 
work. Secondly, growing and powerful businesses are particularly 
concerned for their security, for any firm often feels 
threatened by both organized crime and by the power of the 
state. That has caused the establishment of their own private 
security systems, whose job quality is sufficiently high. Many 
KGB information gathering specialists have gone to firms engaged 
in such activities. Professionals from the former KGB have their 
own agency, their own information gathering channels, possibly 
even connections with the former Soviet, now the Russian 
intelligence service residence in Latvia, with their "end" in 
Moscow. The outflow of professionals encourages an overload of 
work, incomparably low salaries and uncertainty for the future. 
Businesses can pay adequately for this work, which requires a 
near-exhausting intellectual and physical regimen. At the same 
time, large sums of money are being offered to those who are 
potentially dangerous to state security agencies. 
From various sources it is known that for leaving one's job 
(that is, resigning one's current position) sums are being 
offered equal to five times one's annual salary; and this is 
only the beginning offer, which can be haggled over. 
  Business can afford (similar to the "informals") to give 
tremendous technical assurances, which the lean state budget 
purse is unable to provide for its security organizations. 
  Right now many prominent persons, who require the most 
exhaustive information, obtain it from these unofficial sources. 
  The More Agencies, the More Security Is Needed 
  Responsible officials continue to receive operational 
reports 
from the seven security organizations, but it is not normally 
possible to analyze these "seven volumes." The many agencies 
that were established actually reflect the mutual distrust among 
the various political currents which are more or less fancied by 
one or another security institution. This mutual distrust has 
created two intelligence organizations, the Security Agency and 
the State Economic Sovereignty Department (VESAD), functioning 
in parallel. The former has been incriminated as the "pocket 
agency" of the President (or sometimes even of the "national 
radicals"), but the latter is dogged by a reputation as a "den 
of Chekhists," which is illustrated by the seemingly 
professional picketers at the Interior Ministry entrances. While 
VESAD, according to many, is professionally more powerful, the 
Security Agency has always claimed to have a reputation for 
political reliability. It is not known whether one or the other 
conclusion is closer to reality, but this kind of parallelism 
causes dangerous instability which can be exploited by powers 
which are hostile to Latvia's independence. 
  The new espionage rules anticipate the establishment of four 
security organizations, which will have espionage powers: the 
Constitutional Defense bureau, the Interior Ministry's Security 
Police, the Defense Ministry's Intelligence Service, and the 
Home Guard Headquarter's Information Service. I will not dwell 
particularly on the last two. The Home Guard's Information 
Service's functions are specific and completely narrow: tactical 
intelligence in time of operational activities and control over 
their personnel selection and activities (former or current 
connections with the Mafia, convictions and examination of other 
facts). It must be said that in this sense Latvia is a 
completely exotic land, for analogous intelligence agencies in 
volunteer people's militias, which the Home Guard actually is, 
are a completely unique occurence in the world. The Defense 
Ministry's Intelligence Service is an institution of the Defense 
Ministry which carries out military intelligence. This service, 
too, has a unique sphere of work, in which, it seems, there 
could be no overt competition, even if the paths of the security 
organizations crossed. 
  Relations between the Constitutional Defense Bureau and the 
Interior Ministry's Security Police hold the promise of 
interesting developments. Both of these services are the only 
ones of the four with investigative authority; thus they 
distinguish themselves from the others (a unifying moment--all 
four have operational work functions). 
  VESAD Professionals Are Offended 
  The State Economic Sovereignty Defense Department (VESAD), 
which currently is subordinated to the Interior Ministry, is the 
base on which the Security Police will be built, and this base 
already has a certain basis, different from the Constitutional 
Defense Bureau (SAB), which we will be forced to prop up in a 
naked place. Establishment of the SAB (which is hoped to become 
an agency subordinated to the National Security Council), is, of 
course, a wholly painful fact to VESAD. That is connected to the 
particular authority of SAB, because this agency will be the one 
which is offered the authority to control all the others and to 
implement intelligence activities internally. In addition, SAB 
officials authorized by the bureau director will have special 
rights to familiarize themselves fully with the internal 
documents of the intelligence service (regardless of level of 
classification), but the director himself will be permitted to 
examine the identities of information sources of other services, 
or, speaking simply, to learn the true name of an agent. 
  This sort of authority "sends a shiver down the spine" of 
those who have attended the KGB school. To someone who has been 
raised in a holy relationship toward protection of information, 
the fact that someone will be able to rummage around in their 
safe causes fear. Here everyone decides for themselves between a 
liberal and totalitarian direction, stopping at their own 
individual point between two poles. 
  Latvia has no historical analogy to follow in these events. 
After the 1934 coup, when the power of the President was made 
absolute, the Political Administration (or political police), 
which was found in the Interior Ministry, was the only security 
agency and which was reviewed and controlled only by the 
President himself. In the Soviet era the KGB operated 
successfully, which was a state within a state and with 
outstanding information collection methods and unlimited 
authority gave rise to professional arrogance and a sense of 
power among those who worked there. 
  The Security Police may perceive the SAB (which does still 
exist per Cabinet of Ministers decree no. 28) as a potentially 
dangerous service, for it will be a service which they will not 
be able to examine, thus it is logical that professionals will 
not trust them, for among them there is no characteristic 
viewpoint that selling out to Western intelligence agencies is 
less reprehensible than a link with the KGB. Actually, this 
antipathy could be labeled with the inspired phrase that 
is your problem, if only talk were not of the more thorough 
dissemination of information to "their own" people in the 
government or Saeima. 
  SAB: The Great Unknown 
  The proposed rules governing intelligence submitted by the 
Interior Ministry were coordinated by the Interior Ministry's 
parliamentary secretary Linards Mucins. His view is that SAB 
subordination makes for unreliability. SAB, the "umbrella 
organization" for the intelligence community, will be 
subordinated to the National Security Council (the President, 
Prime Minister, National Security Commission leader, etc.), not 
to the Cabinet of Ministers, which as the executive branch would 
always be forced to function only within the constraints of law, 
thereby not permitting the SAB "to break out" in terms of its 
authority, in the sahdow of a rather unclear organization (there 
is still no law on the National Security Council). "The time of 
liberalization is over," says Mr. Mucins. "The time has come to 
honor laws." 
  "It seems to me that the idea of preventing the SAB from 
listing one way or the other has been successfully 
accomplished," says Andrejs Pantalejevs, Saeima National 
Security Commission chairman. "In the beginning there was an 
attempt led by Vectirans to convert the Security Agency to the 
Constitutional Protection Bureau. There were other tendencies. 
We of course thought that that would degrade the essence of the 
SAB. Right now, it seems, we have succeeded in maintaining the 
concept of a new organization, in whose service there will not 
be anyone from among the current security organization workers. 
That is my viewpoint." 
  The painful question about the SAB shows only the tendency 
toward distrust between the executive and legislative branches, 
between the government and the Saeima. The chief ones, it seems, 
are mutual fears of the opposing sides gaining overly great 
authority and potential. President or Prime Minister? 
  If the SAB cadres will really come from the current Security 
Agency, then in conditions of antagonism a [link/union] between 
the SAB and the Security Police will be completely problematic. 
That is why the aforementioned viewpoint about "fresh" cadres 
may be a step toward resolution. 
  To repeat this viewpoint in greater detail (how realistic it 
is can be decided by the experts): Professionalism should not be 
turned into a fetish; unhurriedly, slowly, this service can be 
established one person at a time, accentuting the analytical, 
tidying functions, keeping the internal intelligence of other 
services in the second plan. 
  Regardless, it will be interesting and meaningful to see who 
is nominated to be the bureau's director and what will be his 
political sympathies. 
  The SAB is the child of the era of distrust. It could just 
as 
well be called the child of the era of consolidation, some might 
argue. Time will tell who will win; distrust or consolidation. 
  I completely acknowledge that this article will not satisfy 
any of the sides that are working with development of 
intelligence rules, but neutrality is like innocence: it can be 
lost only once. Let that be my wish to the still unborn child: 
the SAB.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Litvinova, IZVESTIYA: "The Latvian Army: </F>
`Green Beret' Experience Plus Soviet Training"] 
  [Text] The security of the state is becoming a priority for 
the government; Prime Minister of Latvia Valdis Birkavs has 
stated so. It has been announced that defense expenditures will 
be increased, despite the runaway budget deficit. 
  Latvian military men are happy: So far the organizational 
development of the armed forces has been sputtering for strictly 
financial reasons. To be sure, helpers have come along. Germany 
sent the uniforms of the former GDR Army, a little bit of 
materiel, and sea cutters. This country is paying a great deal 
attention to the Latvian army. The German military attache has 
handed a present to Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis 
Pavlovskis--two sets of high-grade picture and audio equipment 
which are used in the conduct of military inspections. Experts 
from Paris have visited in order to learn what assistance France 
could provide. Riga requested assistance on the issues of 
communication, transportation, military medicine, the navy, and 
other spheres. Military instructors who have trained Latvian 
"zemessardze" ("militiamen") have come from Great Britain. The 
minister of defense of Belgium has offered army materiel, 
weapons, and other resources released as a result of reductions 
in the armed forces of Belgium. Finally, the Swedes and the 
Danes have provided continuous assistance: This includes 
consultations, materiel, and monetary subsidies. The Americans 
are sympathetic: A military delegation has just visited Latvia. 
  In the words of Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis 
Pavlovskis, a report has been submitted to the National Defense 
Council analyzing where a military threat to Latvia may 
originate. The content of the report is not yet known. 
Meanwhile, newspapers have been writing about Russia in a harsh 
tone, shaping their own concept of a possible threat and 
potential enemy. 
  According to the Constitution, President Guntis Ulmanis, 
commander in chief of the Defense Forces of Latvia, also heads 
the National Security Council. But, of course, the Ministry of 
Defense plays first fiddle. Latvian military commanders in the 
upper echelon combine the experience of "green berets" and 
participation in the war in Afghanistan; at issue are both the 
minister of defense and the commander of the Defense Forces. 
  Current Minister of Defense Valdis Pavlovskis (who turns 60 
this year) is a civilian. However, he has decent combat 
experience: He reached the rank of captain in the U.S. Marines. 
He commanded a "green beret" unit in Vietnam. As he told 
journalists, he "taught guerrilla tactics" at an officer academy 
in the United States. 
  Valdis Pavlovskis speaks Latvian with a slight accent: He 
was 
born in Riga, but spent his entire life in emigration. 
Pavlovskis was active in organizations coming out against the 
occupation of Latvia by Soviet troops. He returned to the 
republic during the national renaissance period and soon took 
the position of deputy of Talavs Jundzis, the first minister of 
defense of independent Latvia. Jundzis, one of the activists of 
the People's Front, now heads the Baltic Center for Strategic 
Research. Valdis Pavlovskis was elected a deputy in elections to 
the Saeima [parliament] this summer on the ticket of the 
governing party The Latvian Way. 
  In an interview Pavlovskis complained that Balts abroad have 
had to make a great effort to explain to the world why the 
governments of Baltic countries did not even try to offer 
resistance to the Red Army in 1940. In the words of the minister 
of defense, if something similar recurs, we need to show to the 
world: We are capable of fighting for our freedom. Commander of 
the Defense Forces Dainis Turlais voiced a similar point of view 
during a conference: "Our main task is to protect the country 
against an aggressor at least for a few days so that the public 
of the world and its organizations will be able to respond to 
the conflict." 
  The order discharging Colonel Dainis Turlais from the Soviet 
Army was signed by Marshal Shaposhnikov. Turlais, the former 
chief of the operations section of the 40th Army (he fought in 
Afghanistan for three years), gave up a promising career in 
Russia, discontinued studies at the Academy of the General 
Staff, and returned to Latvia to build its own armed forces. 
Dainis Turlais is 43; he is energetic. The new, old-style 
Latvian uniform fits him like a glove. In Turlais's opinion, the 
Defense Forces of Latvia should consist of 10,000 people. 
Attention should be focused on border guard formations. Rifle 
battalions within the country should assist them if necessary. 
However, the security concept and the defense plan which is now 
being developed will still change because literally the last few 
weeks have compelled many changes in the concepts of the Latvian 
military, who are inspired by the support of NATO specialists. 
  For now, Latvian military cadres are being trained mainly 
within the republic. The Academy of National Defense of Latvia 
is housed on the premises of the imeni Biryuzov School, one of 
the best in the former Union. The academy is headed by Valdis 
Matiss, likewise a former colonel of the Soviet Army: He headed 
a department at the imeni Frunze Academy. The current military 
attache of Latvia in Russia, Gunars Alksnis, headed the 
department of instruction at the same academy. Tactical 
intelligence is his specialty. Latvian officers are also invited 
to study abroad, but poor knowledge of foreign languages is an 
obstacle. Incidentally, the language problem also surfaced 
during joint exercises of the defense forces of the three Baltic 
states: In what language are commands to be given so that 
everybody would understand--not in the Russian language of 
occupation, really? The minister of defense of Latvia ordered 
that the system of commands and organization of communications 
adopted in NATO be mastered this year. 
  Only citizens of Latvia are drafted for service in its armed 
forces. However, some are not in a hurry to do their patriotic 
duty. They evade the daily round of the army and desert their 
units. Drinking and recruit hazing are flourishing. They have 
already become the reason for fatal accidents. Here, two border 
guards shot each other; there, a young guardian of the border, 
after firing at his comrade. went further away from the post and 
shot himself. The taunting of new recruits in a convoy regiment 
ended in tragedy: Young soldiers driven to despair by outrages 
in the unit decided to flee. Three Latvian guys tried to cross 
the border in order to hide out in Russia, but the Latvian 
border guards apprehended them. Some junior commanders were 
relieved from their positions following an inquiry. Incidents in 
the Defense Forces are dwarfed by the "glory" of the dashing 
"zemessardze": loss of weapons, murders, drunken disorderliness. 
"Zemessardze" ("militia," or literally "guards of the land") are 
a peculiar structure. "Patriots make up the militia"--this is 
how Girts Kristovskis, recently the militia chief of staff 
(currently minister of internal affairs) characterized his 
comrades. Activists of the People's Front and more radical 
organizations of that time became "zemessardze." The trouble is 
that patriotism is no substitute for training and discipline. 
For a long time members of the militia in spotted camouflage 
smacked of "Makhno's guys" possessed by the national-patriotic 
idea. To be sure, attempts have been recently made to give them 
a more or less civilized appearance. At any rate, there are 
fewer scandals associated with these people, who are armed and 
very dangerous. Evaluating the year 1993 in an interview to the 
newspaper DIENA, the minister of defense observed: "The 
relationship between the Defense Forces and the militia has 
improved perceptibly. It is now much easier to find a common 
language to achieve common objectives." Latvia was the first 
among the republics of the former Union to introduce alternative 
service, but soon gave it up: It was ineffective, and control 
was lacking. Labor service was introduced, but it is virtually 
defunct, too: There is unemployment in the state, and those who 
draw benefits for months do not have enough slots to use their 
energies. The Ministry of Defense has developed new rules for 
induction into the military service: It is envisioned reducing 
the number of categories of individuals ineligible for the 
draft. However, the plan is to reduce the duration of service to 
one year, with the exception of those who will have to master 
advanced materiel. 
  How many soldiers are there in the Latvian army? According 
to 
data from the newspaper NEATKARIGA CINA, at present the Defense 
Forces have 1,500 soldiers and 150 officers. Six hundred 
soldiers and 30 officers serve in the naval forces. At the 
border, 338,000 [as published] soldiers and 340 officers are in 
the service. The navy consists of 15 vessels (nine are on full 
readiness). The air force has two An-2 planes and two L-410's 
(one is in operation). There are six helicopters. The Latvian 
army has to date been using mainly former Soviet weapons. A 
batch of Czech assault rifles has been purchased. Head of the 
Cabinet of Ministers Valdis Birkavs stated that Latvia, like 
Estonia, intends to buy weapons from Israel. 
  Since the beginning of the year the armed forces of the 
three 
Baltic states have noticeably stepped up coordination of their 
actions. Preparations are underway for joint exercises of rifle 
companies; in February they will be held in Estonia, in July--in 
Lithuania, and in October--in Latvia. As Chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Commission Aleksandrs Kirsteins said, pooling their 
efforts will make it possible for the Baltic states to create a 
powerful echelon of defense against a potential aggressor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Aleksandr Starchenko, Russian </F>
Military Division Commander dislocated from Dobele, and the 
Assistant to the Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Krasnov, 
by Sarma Kocane: "Russians Are Very Patient People"] 
  [Text] 
  [Kocane] How does the Russian soldier in Latvia feel right 
now? 
  [Starchenko] In the past two to three years, the presence of 
our army here has been used for various political reasons. The 
same is occurring in Russia. But we are totally apolitical. 
Attempts are being made to convince the Latvians that we are 
aggressors. That is not our disposition. A situation of conflict 
occurred with Rucs and our detained generals, and our divisions 
had to be in combat readiness. But this is natural -- it is the 
law. Of course, everyone was thinking the same thing -- let it 
all end peacefully, let there be no blood shed. I am not a 
believer, but I would like to say -- thank God that everything 
turned out all right. Every soldier and every officer was happy 
about that. 
  [Krasnov] This only demonstrated that our army can be 
regulated. But your military units act without thinking, the way 
we used to say -- "according to the revolutionary conscience". 
All right, so Rucs told them what to do. And then what? Didn't 
they themselves understand what could happen? 
  [Starchenko] And also -- the fight against crime. Your 
military units have now been given unrestricted rights. I have 
my doubts about their loyalty when it comes to the Russian army. 
If we are being checked under the barrel of a gun, if we are 
threatened --this could very easily create another situation of 
conflict. Who is interested in causing this? Who has the right 
to search through my car and my pockets? Our foreign passports 
are considered illegal in Latvia. They are valid in all other 
countries, but for us to remain here, we are issued these little 
pieces of paper, real "walking papers". And this applies not 
only to us, but also to our wives and children! Written on these 
is -- valid until December 31, 1993. A new year has started, and 
we are told -- we are here illegally. We have to paste a red 
star in our car window, and we are even told where to paste it 
--at the spot where the most senior person sits. This looks like 
target practice -- if this is where they will aim, I will 
certainly get hit. Mr. Upmalis decides how many and what sort of 
vehicles we are allowed to use! I tell him -- I need fifty to 
supply my section, and he answers -- you will make do with ten. 
He knows better than I do! He, himself, is a high ranking Soviet 
officer. But now, he looks at a person in a Russian military 
uniform with the same amount of animosity as he looks at a 
Russian with no uniform. 
  [Kocane] Speaking about the detained generals, you said that 
our military units do not consider what they are doing. Would 
you follow orders that were irrational? 
  [Krasnov] We learned in 1991. In such cases, we will only 
obey written orders. These cannot be turned around later on. The 
incident with Rucs -- this once again confirms what patient 
people the Russians are. The Americans in our situation would 
have immediately taken action. Remember Panama! 
  [Kocane] Overall, how would you evaluate Russia's attitude 
towards Latvia, the Baltics and other former Soviet republics? 
  [Krasnov] Russia is the richest nation in Europe, but as you 
can see, we are still engaging in talks with you -- as one equal 
with another. Naturally, we don't have to be doing that. 
  [Starchenko] Of course, during the Soviet era, life in 
Latvia 
and the other republics was better than in Russia. Have you 
thought about this? 
  [Krasnov] And if you also consider how rich Latvia is in 
natural resources and how many valuable mining products it has... 
  [Starchenko] It would be interesting to see your state's 
reaction if suddenly Russia were to say: all Latvians, 
Estonians, Lithuanians -- march, back to your countries. We will 
no longer allow you to live here! 
  [Kocane] At present, what are the most difficult to resolve 
problems for your family members? 
  [Starchenko] Our wives are losing their jobs. All right, I 
understand that this is supposedly being done because they don't 
know the language. But there are cases where someone is not 
being let go, although he doesn't know a word of Latvian. This 
happens when you have a shortage of this type of specialist. We 
have specific examples. It would be interesting to know why the 
language law isn't being imposed in this case? 
  [Krasnov] The Latvian educational system spans 12 years, the 
Russian -- 11. My daughter is graduating from the eleventh 
grade, but if we move to Russia, she will have to repeat the 
eleventh grade. We asked permission for our children to be 
taught according to the Russia curriculum, at least in one 
school. We were not allowed. The Latvian language is now 
considered as the standard. However, its level of teaching is 
extremely low. 
  [Starchenko] I am an officer, and my family has been in 
Latvia for two years. Before this, we lived in Armenia. Now, I 
will probably end up in Estonia or Georgia. Will my children 
really be required to master all of these languages? My daughter 
is eleven years old. She goes to a store where they only speak 
Latvian to her. The child is unable to converse in Latvian, and 
she returns home without having bought anything. Animosity has 
been created between Latvian and Russian children. Has anyone 
considered how this has happened? 
  [Kocane] You said that your new place of relocation is 
Strugy 
Krasniye, which is located 60 kilometers from Pskov. What awaits 
you there? 
  [Starchenko] An empty field. A small village is located 
about 
7 kilometers away. Maybe some will be able to rent rooms for 
their families. But at least 400 families from here are going. I 
have three children. If someone were to promise me a two room 
apartment, I would be very thankful. We are leaving behind here 
two apartments. Doesn't the Latvian government feel obligated to 
build something for us in their place? I am not asking for 
barracks, or garages, but only a place in which to put our 
families. Maybe also a small clinic, a little schoolhouse, and a 
bath house. What should we do? Live in tents with our children? 
Send our families to live with relatives? Many don't have any, 
others have relatives who live in hot spots -- as for example, 
north Caucasus. Still others just don't have that much living 
space. Our children will have no place to study -- the village 
has a school, but it is overfilled. There is no kindergarten. 
And it is self-evident -- there is no work for our wives. What 
are our families guilty of? 
  [Krasnov] The Russian people did not suffer any less than 
other peoples during the Stalinist and stagnation years. 
  [Kocane] If you are the only providers for your families, 
are 
you able to support them on your salaries? 
  [Starchenko] Yes. 
  [Krasnov] We receive our salaries in Russian rubles and in 
lats -the same as everywhere abroad. 
  [Starchenko] But, believe me, your lats will not maintain 
its 
level for long. The stability of the lats is only an illusion. 
  [Krasnov] We can support our families, but we are unable to 
buy apartments in Russia. 
  [Kocane] How many empty apartments are there in Dobele-1 and 
Dobele-2 right now, and what is happening with them? 
  [Krasnov] About 40% of the apartments are empty 
right now. 
We are not allowed to sell them. If a person comes and says -- I 
have no place to live, our commander gives him an apartment. 
  [Starchenko] We could say -- I won't give it to you -- you 
are a Latvian -- why do you speak Russian with an accent? 
  [Krasnov] Of course, the city board is not registering these 
people. Why is this so? Apparently the board is planning to hold 
an auction and then rip off these people three-fold. 
  [Kocane] What are your thoughts about the future of the 
Skrunda radar detection facility? 
  [Krasnov] This facility is necessary for the safety of 
Europe. I will say frankly -- from there we can tell where a 
rocket or an atomic bomb has been fired. America has the same 
type of facility in Denmark. If the Skrunda facility is 
dismantled, half of Europe will remain without surveillance. We 
should think about security in general! Skrunda is better 
insurance for Latvia's security than all of your armed forces. 
Do you have such a large army? If you consider Russia to be your 
major enemy, then, even if all of Latvia's inhabitants are 
armed, you will not be able to stand up against our army! 
  [Starchenko] Skrunda is also needed by Latvia, but for your 
government, the principle is more important. 
  [Krasnov] The same thing happened at the end of the nineteen 
eighties, when many enterprises were closed, supposedly because 
of ecological reasons. It is now known that this was purely a 
political move. And Skrunda is also a political move. You 
shouldn't be afraid of it. Intelligent and rational people are 
employed there. You certainly don't have any such specialists to 
operate this radar facility. Dismantle it? With what funds? You 
already have a budget deficit. I think that -- what is needed 
here is, for instance, NATO as an impartial party to decide -- 
whether to leave the Skrunda radar facility or not. Otherwise, I 
doubt whether both of our sides will be able to come to an 
agreement. 
  [Kocane] What is your opinion of the election results in 
Russia? 
  [Krasnov] You are probably asking about Zhirinovsky. 
Luckily, 
there were his latest comments -- about the Japanese blockade 
and changing presidents in Bulgaria, and so forth. No one takes 
him seriously anymore. This is just a comedy. Naturally, we 
should realize that there will be more of these 
Zhirinovsky-types. In the present situation, we are creating 
them ourselves. However, it should be mentioned that the people 
don't trust Gaidar, either. People are sinking in poverty. I can 
speak highly of the government only after I have eaten. And 
also, a statesman's outward appearance it also important. Look 
at how the American President looks. What a stance he has! 
  No matter what -- we only want one thing. That is for our 
army to be kept out of any involvements. We only want peace.

<F P=106> [Article by Edmundas Ganuskauskas: "The January Theses of M. </F>
Burokevicius for the Prime Minister of Lithuania"] 
  [Text] "We hereby forward proposals of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania for measures to 
overcome the crisis in the republic. The Communists of Lithuania 
will duly facilitate the implementation of these proposals for 
the benefit of the working people. Respectfully yours..."--these 
are the words opening a letter from...Mikolas Burokevicius to 
Prime Minister of Lithuania A. Slezevicius on the occasion of 
the third anniversary of 13 January. 
  The document of the Communists narrates: "The renewal and 
development of the Communist Party of Lithuania in the republic. 
It is necessary to restore in Lithuania the political power of 
the working people as represented by the soviets; while 
implementing democracy consistently, to restore the national 
economy and develop production; and to radically improve the 
standard of living of the people." It is indicated in what 
manner the improvement in the standard of living of the 
population is to be achieved: "To undertake initiatives aimed at 
urgently convening a conference of the heads of governments of 
all or most of the former Soviet republics." 
  Having generously shared wise ideas with the head of the 
Government of Lithuania, M. Burokevicius completes his program 
for overcoming the crisis with the demand "to cancel the ban on 
the activities of the Communist Party and stop the judicial 
persecution of it, political blackmail, and moral terror against 
Communists." 
  During the days of the restoration congress of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union, which was held in April of last year, 
the leader of the Lithuanian Communists, who was elected to the 
Central Committee and was in hiding outside of Lithuania, 
responded to questions from LETUVOS RITAS correspondent V. 
Bartusevicius. He boasted of having restored the entire party 
structure: "Even our secretariat operates in Lithuania." 
  Last year a few issues of the newspaper TARIBU LIETUVA 
(Soviet Lithuania) in the Lithuanian and Russian languages were 
published in neighboring Belarus. The headlines were "Awaken 
Those Who Sleep" and "Resistance Will Grow." The text was not 
short on propaganda, either: "It is necessary to go to the 
inactive, passive trade unions. In instances where it is 
impossible to bring them to life, new trade unions should be 
created.... to engage in picketing, to prepare petitions.... 
Occupation strikes during which workers seize plants are 
particularly effective." 
  It appears that at all times, occupation was the guarantee 
of 
the accomplishments of the Communist Party. During these days 
Lithuania is honoring the victims of one of the breaches in the 
occupation.

<F P=106> [Article by Kestutis Junskis: "Minister of National Defense </F>
Beats Back Attacks of the Opposition"] 
  [Text] Minister of National Defense L. Linkevicius met with 
representatives of the parliamentary opposition. 
  Referring to practical endeavors which may be accomplished 
prior to the adoption of a military doctrine and national 
security concept, L. Linkevicius stressed that it is necessary 
to begin to actually control the borders and airspace of 
Lithuania. The minister said: "We should make our contribution 
to the system of collective security because so far we have to a 
certain degree been dependents." He did not reject the 
likelihood of military formations from Lithuania taking part in 
a UN peacekeeping mission, or the need for young men in service 
with the army to not only take weapons and drill training but to 
also study the English language. 
  Outlining his view of the reorganization of the DSOK 
[National Volunteer Defense Service], L. Linkevicius said that 
the reorganization does not amount to elimination of the DSOK, 
and that under the current conditions this structure could 
perform the functions of a volunteer national guard and assume 
responsibility for territorial defense and security for 
important state facilities. In the opinion of L. Linkevicius, 
from now on only those who have been in active military service, 
have been recommended by their commanders, and have impeccable 
biographies should be volunteers. 
  Seimas member P. Tupikas asked whether L. Linkevicius feels 
morally responsible for the fact that the Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party, while in opposition, hampered A. Butkevicius in 
creating a system of national defense, compromised it in every 
way possible, and papers were endlessly slipped to A. Brazauskas 
in the Supreme Council. L. Linkevicius answered that he did not 
engage in these affairs. 
  Seimas member A. Patackas said that "volunteers are being 
separated from their weapons," which only staff employees will 
be trusted with keeping. Such employees are few; for this 
reason, at many locations weapons are kept solely at command 
posts. In the words of A. Patackas, in this situation the main 
principle is violated: "A volunteer should always have his 
weapon handy." 
  A. Patackas expressed concern in conjunction with the fact 
that a structural reorganization is also being planned after the 
certification of volunteers in the course of which, according to 
his information, they rejected the services of at least 
one-third of the volunteers. The member of Seimas called on the 
minister to remember that volunteers are a patriotic force, too; 
in turn, the minister observed that patriotism is not a 
profession, and genuine patriots cannot compromise the DSOK. 
  Minister of National Defense L. Linkevicius said that 
weapons 
should be stored strictly in keeping with the rules. The 
argument that the volunteers might need armaments at any moment 
in order to repulse enemy attacks did not convince him. L. 
Linkevicius said: "We do not have this kind of situation now," 
and repeated yet again that weapons are not toys. 
  The minister rejected rebukes that he did not demand 
allocation of more funds from the 1994 budget for the system of 
national defense. The minister of defense said: "Being a member 
of the government, I cannot fail to think about education and 
health care, too." In the words of L. Linkevicius, there will be 
sufficient funds for military training; however, it may become 
necessary to reduce the army.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Kazimieras Antanavicius, member of </F>
the Seimas Economics Committee, by VALSTIECIU LAIKRASTIS 
correspondent Juozas Kulakauskas; place and date not given: 
"What Does the 1994 Budget Hold in Store?"] 
  [Text] With a majority voting in favor, the Seimas approved 
the 1994 state budget on New Year's Eve. Opposition 
representatives gave a negative evaluation of the new budget, 
saying that it is socially unfair and a sham. We talked about 
the new budget with Seimas Economics Committee member Professor 
Kazimieras Antanavicius. 
  [Kulakauskas] Perhaps you would compare for us this year's 
budget to last year's with respect to our economic development. 
Are there signs in the budget that our country's economy has 
stabilized or moved forward by at least a little bit? 
  [Antanavicius] It is possible to compare the situation in 
this regard, and it should be done. And a reply to your question 
can be given after analyzing sources of revenue and changes in 
production. Data from the economics and finance ministries 
indicate that the gross domestic product for production, 
especially in agriculture, will be the same in 1994 as it was in 
1993. But in real prices, the gross domestic product for 1992 
amounted to only 47.5 percent of the 1989 level, and for 1993, 
only 35.4 percent. Therefore, compared to the previous year, 
production in 1993 dropped by 12 percent and will comprise only 
a third of the 1989 production level this year. So one cannot 
speak of any kind of improvement in the economy. 
  Despite the fact that there is no economic upswing, revenues 
and outlays are being increased and will approximately double in 
1994. Since there is a drop in production and stagnation, this 
means that revenues can only be increased when taxes are 
continually increased for the inhabitants. And the leadership, 
unfortunately, is going down this road. Although a majority of 
inhabitants already finds itself below the poverty level, the 
leadership keeps coming up with new taxes: for income, for 
resurveying land, for documents specifying the organization of 
land exploitation (land cadastres), various certificates, 
excises, etc. And all this is being done at a time when state 
enterprises are not settling accounts in time with rural 
inhabitants for agricultural production that has been delivered, 
and when limits are being set on the purchase of this 
production. This is simple robbery, and the reason it is 
becoming impossible to live in Lithuania. 
  There can be two kinds of robbers in the country: those 
outside the scope of the law and those government officials who 
cloak themselves in the law. Even if the people can avoid the 
former by fleeing or by defending themselves, they are powerless 
against the latter. Groundless taxes smother the desire of the 
people to work better, ruin production and the entire economy, 
increase people's dissatisfaction and the social tension in the 
country. 
  [Kulakauskas] How do you assess the proportions foreseen in 
the budget for financing the fields of economics and social 
matters? Is it right, for example, that the amount of funding 
being earmarked for maintaining the country's government 
apparatus is greater than that earmarked for culture and 
education, and almost as much as is being set aside for 
agriculture, health care, and social concerns? 
  [Antanavicius] Unfortunately, we still have a very long way 
to go until we arrive at intelligent proportions. U.S. President 
B. Clinton--who was elected a year ago--and his administration 
started their work by looking for ways to decrease the funds 
used for governing the country. French president F. Mitterrand 
is undertaking to do the same thing towards the end of his term 
of office. But I--having already spent several years in the 
highest institution of our government--have never heard the verb 
"to save". 
  This year, expenditures for governing the country are being 
increased approximately twice as much as those for other areas. 
This means that official plans call for appropriating 9 percent 
of budget funds in 1994--and in fact this is about 12 
percent--to expand and maintain the government apparatus. In 
Latvia, meanwhile, 6 percent is being earmarked for this 
purpose, and in Estonia, Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the total 
is about 5 percent. And the latter three countries are markedly 
richer than Lithuania. It is incomprehensible how the government 
cannot see the poverty of thousands of its country's people and 
how it can completely uselessly give away to officials the money 
collected from the inhabitants who have earned it with their 
blood and sweat. In this situation, the justified question 
arises: whom does such a government represent--society, or only 
itself? 
  [Kulakauskas] How do you assess the agricultural policy that 
the LDDP is implementing now? Is sufficient attention paid in 
the budget to agricultural financing? 
  [Antanavicius] So far there is no normal agricultural policy 
at all. Lithuania is not going to be able to establish a market 
agricultural economy without government subsidies, because 
farmers will not have the funds for farm machinery, fertilizers, 
or the construction of farm buildings. Unless it has government 
support, the Lithuanian farm will remain a source of sustenance 
only for the elderly people living there, because the production 
of agricultural products will continue to fall. 
  There was talk in the LDDP's election program about state 
support for agriculture, but that has now been forgotten. In the 
spring of last year, for example, funds earmarked for farm 
subsidies were transformed into credits, without giving thought 
to how the farmers would be able to repay those credits if the 
state itself does not pay them on time for the products they 
have produced and delivered and if the state cannot force state 
enterprises to settle accounts on time with the people. What 
kind of government is this? 
  On the other hand, the state is obliged to foresee in the 
budget not only funds to support agriculture, but also to 
provide sufficient notice as to what kind of agricultural 
production it intends to buy up, and in what quantities, so that 
the people would know that their labor will not be for naught. 
The state should help the farmers venture into foreign markets. 
Unfortunately, no one is worrying about this and the farmers, 
especially those who have recently begun to farm on their own 
land, are left to the whims of fate. 
  Also, there is one clause in the budget which states that 
subsidies, i.e. support, will be provided to the farm by 
decreasing agricultural taxes. In other words, the people will 
be "supported" by the money in their own pockets. This is real 
derision. Given this kind of government policy, one just wants 
to shout out to the farmers: "Work only as much as is necessary 
to satisfy your own needs and those of your relatives, because 
if you produce any more production, you will only have more 
worries, and possibly losses as well!" 
  [Kulakauskas] How do you evaluate the ongoing argument 
between the government and the opposition on the indexing of 
people's deposits? 
  [Antanavicius] Deposits have to be indexed. This should have 
been done quite a bit earlier, when the litas was introduced. I 
had prepared a draft of a law dealing with this and proposed it 
to the Seimas, but the majority in Seimas did not take it into 
consideration, as they also did not take into consideration many 
intelligent suggestions for better preparing the 1994 budget. 
  [Kulakauskas] Do you have any regrets about withdrawing from 
the post of chairman of the Seimas Economics Committee? 
  [Antanavicius] I don't, because to remain in this position 
would mean being responsible for the entirety of economic 
policy, and it is morally unjustifiable and inexpedient to be 
responsible for a policy with which one does not agree and which 
one has no possiblities to change.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "`The Market' of Crimes in the Baltic </F>
Countries is Overloaded -- 60,378 Crimes Were Recorded in 
Lithuania Last Year"] 
  [Text] In 1992, they were fewer by 6.6 percent. On the 
average, there were 160.9 crimes for every 10,000 inhabitants of 
the country (150.5 two years ago). This index makes the 
situation in Lithuania appear somewhat milder than in Latvia 
(184.8) and Estonia (232.4), however, the absolute number of 
crimes in the neighboring countries is decreasing (14.8 and 9.9 
percent, respectively). One should at least be glad that the 
pace of the increase of crimes in Lithuania has slowed down as 
many as four times since the beginning of the year. 
  The analysis of criminality has revealed one more trend -- 
its increase during 1992-1993 was determined not by the 
country's seven largest cities, as previously, but by the 
provinces. The sharpest rise in the number of crimes was seen in 
the districts of Visagina (148.1 percent), Radviliskis (54.7 
percent), Salcininkai (40.7 percent), Raseinial (38.9 percent), 
Lazdijai (31.1 percent). The highest level of criminality exists 
in the Panevezys district (297.7 crimes for every 10,000 
inhabitants), in the city and district of Klaipeda (236.5 and 
260.8 percent, respectively), and in the districts of Silute 
(219.7), Kedainiai (214.9), Pasvalys (212.4), and Lazdijai 
(208.1), while the national average is 160.9. According to this 
index, the inhabitants of Ignalina (40.5), Svencionys (78.6), 
Trakai (84.9), and Telsiai (91.1) should feel the safest of all.

  One more trend is the increase in the specific gravity of 
serious crimes. Six thousand two hundred ten such crimes were 
committed last year (37.5 percent more than in 1992), an average 
of 630 a month. Every eighth crime is violence directed against 
an individual (14.1 percent in 1992). The number of such crimes 
has increased by 21.4 percent last year. Murderers were 
particularly active: 75 deliberate murders or attempts at murder 
were registered during the first quarter of the year, while 
during the last quarter the number jumped to 157. About one 
fifth of all grave violent crimes are committed by using 
firearms and explosives. Last year the police have recorded 416 
deliberate murders (56.4 percent more than in 1992), 64 (or 73 
percent more) attempts at murder, 196 (2.6 percent more) rapes, 
and 344 (0.6 percent fewer) deliberate bodily injuries. 
  Last year saw a marked decline in the secret character of 
the 
coercive actions against property -- this is primarily linked 
with preventive detention and the confidentiality accorded to 
witnesses. Established cases of racketeering have gone up from 
44 to 234 -- more than five times. This crime has victimized 
mainly the inhabitants of the cities and districts of Vilnius 
(18 percent of all the coercive actions against property), 
Kaunas (10 percent), and Siauliai (7 percent). 
  Crimes against property constituted the main share of all 
crimes (79.2 percent); thefts comprised 96.1 percent of them. 
The portion of thefts involving state property has declined from 
29 to 24.8 percent (apparently, because of privatization), but 
theft of private property has increased by 9.2 percent. 
Robberies of state property have increased almost one and a half 
times, and of individual property -- by nearly one half. More 
than 70 statements by citizens on stolen automobiles or open 
thefts were received during the last three months of 1993 alone. 
Open thefts have gone up by one fourth; every 10th crime against 
private property was open robbery of citizens' property. 
  Eight hundred twenty cases of fraud were recorded last year 
-- twice as many as in 1992. They were mostly activities related 
to non-existing tourism enterprises, fictional material 
services, purchases, sales, or currency transactions. 
  Three thousand sixty-seven economic crimes were exposed in 
1993 -- one fifth more than the year before last. These crimes 
have increased so rapidly because of mass attempts to 
counterfeit currency. One thousand three hundred sixty-five 
counterfeit bank notes and coins valued at 32,193 litas were 
removed from circulation between the introduction of the litas 
and January 10 of this year. 
  Individuals who committed 38,177 criminal acts -- or almost 
two thirds of recorded crimes -- remained undiscovered or 
avoided punishment. One half of serious crimes remained unsolved 
-- including every third serious bodily injury and malicious 
hooliganism, every fourth deliberate murder, every fifth attempt 
at murder, every sixth rape, every 10th assault on property. 
Seventeen thousand six hundred eighteen criminal cases were 
brought before the law (80 percent of cleared up crimes) -- 
which is 3.2 percent more than last year. More than one fifth of 
the perpetrators of crimes had been tried before. They have 
committed 26.6 percent of all the uncovered crimes.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Miller: "Civil War: Historical Parallels"] </F>
  [Text] From time to time we hear these sort of remarks in 
the mass media: "Thank God we are not yet in a civil war," or 
"The most important task today is to avert a civil war," or 
"Russia will not survive another civil war." It is hard to 
disagree with all of this. Still, much in this respect remains 
unsaid. On one hand, fortunately, our country is indeed 
currently not crisscrossed by civil war fronts as it was in 
1918-1920. But there also is another side to it. Unfortunately, 
armed conflicts are an almost inevitable companion of the 
political instability that is inherent in every revolution. And 
we do not have the right to close our eyes to armed conflicts in 
the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and other places, which 
essentially have one common source--the revolutionary (or 
counterrevolutionary, if one looks at it from the position of 
left-wing forces) disintegration of the Union. 
  Associations with the civil war also inevitably come to mind 
when one reads reports (I am almost tempted to say summaries of 
operations) from the civil war fronts in the former Yugoslavia. 
Yes, on the surface it is apparently religious and ethnic 
conflicts that are driving it in Croatia, as well as Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. It is clear to an attentive observer, however, that 
they are developing in the form of a full-scale civil war 
resembling in many respects the postrevolution events in Russia. 
  One of the conclusions that should be drawn in this 
connection is that we should abandon the old habit of 
classifying as civil war only a clearly defined social armed 
conflict. As historical experience tells us, conflicts of other 
kinds may acquire the form of a civil war, although in each of 
them a social component is undoubtedly present (see on this 
also: P. Shevotsukov. "Civil War. A Look Across the Decades." 
SVOBODNAYA MYSL, 1992, No. 10; Yu. Polyakov. "A Civil War? An 
Interethnic War?" SVOBODNAYA MYSL, 1993, No. 8). 
  Comparisons between the civil war in Russia and analogous 
events on the territory of Yugoslavia also evoke another 
thought. With all the differences that form a foundation of 
these conflicts, one cannot fail to notice a score of common 
features, which modern journalism frequently portrays only as 
specific to the civil war in our country. This includes a 
horrible bitterness that results in massive-scale homicide of 
the civilian population, hostage taking, terror, and so on. By 
the way, the same happened in France in 1793-1795, in the United 
States in 1861-1865, and Spain in 1936-1939. Hence, conclusions 
regarding the alleged special cruelty of the civil war of 
1918-1920, ostensibly specific to our country, clearly need to 
be revised. 
  In my opinion the time has long come to also sort out what 
content we place in the notion "civil war." One can see, as they 
say, "with the naked eye" that some researchers see civil war as 
a process of armed struggle between citizens of the 
same country, between different parts of society, while others 
see civil war only as a period in the country's 
history during which armed conflicts define its entire life. I 
believe that both approaches have a right to exist (naturally, 
provided clarification is made as to what precisely is meant), 
and attempts to reject one of them only complicates the 
substance of the matter. If we accept this postulate, however, 
it will also make it much easier to answer the question of when 
the civil war started and when it ended, as well as many other 
questions. 
  If we look at the civil war in Russia as a 
process, it will become clear that its first act were 
the events in Petrograd and other cities at the end of February 
1917. Armed clashes on the streets of the capital in April and 
July; the Kornilov offensive in August; the "peasant uprising" 
in September; the October events in Petrograd, Moscow, and a 
number of other places in the country, as well as certain 
episodes of the period which later was called "the triumphal 
march of Soviet power," also fall into this category. 
  By the beginning of 1918 this phase had come to an end to a 
large extent. This state of affairs is what Social 
Revolutionaries' leader V. Chernov actually meant when in his 5 
January speech to the Constituent Assembly he expressed hope for 
an imminent end to the civil war. Of course, at the time seats 
of civil war were still smoldering in Ukraine, North Caucasus 
(the Volunteer Army), and a number of Cossack regions, but quite 
a few people felt at the time that the stormy preceding period 
was about to be replaced by a different, more peaceful one. 
Contrary to these expectations, however, new seats of conflict 
continued to flare up, and in the middle of 1918 the 
period of civil war had already begun, ending only in 
November 1920 with the defeat of P. Vrangel's army. Civil war 
(as a process), however, still continued after that. 
Among its episodes were the Kronstadt mutiny and Antonov's 
offensive in 1921; the military actions in the Far East, which 
ended in 1922; and the Basmach movement in Central Asia, mostly 
liquidated by 1926, but completely eradicated only by 1933. 
  In my opinion, it is not only justifiable but also necessary 
to look into another side of civil war. I mean the civil war 
mentality as a very important part of the mass conscience. Here 
are the two most popular formulae of this psychology: "If the 
enemy does not surrender, he must be destroyed" and "Those who 
are not with us are against us." Once such views set in, it 
becomes impossible to speak of a "political adversary" (or even 
a "scientific opponent"). These notions are replaced by that of 
"enemy," which has to be unmasked and then destroyed unless he 
surrenders (and sometimes even after he has surrendered and even 
"admitted his guilt"). 
  It is wrong to think that a civil war mentality comes into 
existence with the beginning of armed conflicts and dies after 
they end. Civil war (as a process) was already underway in 
October-November of 1917, but political adversaries who 
surrendered (and even participants in the armed struggle) not 
only were not being destroyed--they were set free on their "word 
of honor." These days it is considered improper to mention, for 
instance, that the Bolsheviks released on their word of honor 
not only many former ministers of the Provisional Government but 
also cadets--participants in the 29 October rebellion--after 
they promised not to fight against the Soviet power in the 
future. General Krasnov also was set free on his word of honor 
after being defeated on the battlefield--who, by the way, along 
with many cadets, immediately continued armed struggle against 
the Soviet power. 
  It took a rather lengthy period of time for the civil war 
mentality to become part of the flesh and blood of the people of 
that time. It is hard (probably impossible) to tell precisely 
which of the opposing sides had the first decisive word. As 
witnessed by a multitude of documents the author of this article 
studied over many years, one of the first steps in this 
direction was General L. Kornilov's order to the Volunteer Army 
(January 1918): "Do not take any prisoners" (see in more detail 
G.Z. Ioffe. "The White Affair. General Kornilov." Moscow, 1989, 
p. 233). There is an ongoing argument as to which came 
first--the "white terror" or the "red terror." I think we should 
keep in mind this order by Kornilov, but there is another point 
that is no less important. Both types of terror were closely 
interconnected and served as justification for one another: If 
"they" do this, "we" also have an absolute right to. It is this 
"interaction" that produced this specific civil war atmosphere. 
  In my opinion, at this point a clarification is in order. In 
our journalism (and sometimes in scientific literature as well) 
the word "terror" is used in a broad sense, mixing together two 
close but still distinct notions--"repression" and "terror." It 
would suffice to look into the most elementary dictionary to 
find out that repression is a "punitive measure, punishment," 
while terror is "a policy of intimidation, suppression of 
political opponents by violent means" ("Foreign Words 
Dictionary," Moscow, 1981, pp. 441, 505). Therefore, actions of 
official organs aimed against real participants in 
antigovernment actions cannot be classified as terror. Actions 
against innocent people, on the other hand--hostage killing or 
elimination of "persons of questionable background" 
("bourgeoisie" on one side of the front line and "proletarians" 
on the other) should unquestionably be treated as terror. The 
usual purpose of terror is to suppress potential opponents' and 
their potential allies' will to continue the struggle. The 
experience of civil war shows, however, that it is impossible to 
break the will of a determined adversary by terror. Members of 
the fence-sitting strata are another matter. True, as historical 
experience shows, even among them the terror may cause a reverse 
reaction--the desire to avenge the slain innocent. So its 
practical effectiveness usually is not very high. It is my deep 
conviction, however, that without terror the civil war mentality 
could not establish itself and take root. 
  It is not accidental that the civil war mentality remained 
one of the most important components of the mass conscience in 
our country many decades after the armed struggle had ended. I 
think that without it neither the mass violence against the 
peasantry during collectivization nor the "repressions" of the 
1930's to the early 1950's would have been possible. 
  I believe that the persistence of the civil war mentality 
was 
the result of a number of factors. They include the existence of 
a considerable anti-Soviet diaspora that attempted to organize 
its supporters inside the country in order to renew armed 
struggle. Also the actions of Western and Eastern powers aimed 
at the weakening (and subsequent overthrow) of Soviet power, 
which were used by the official propaganda. And finally the 
"Comintern" [Communist International] aspect of the mass 
conscience, one of the elements of which was interpreting quite 
disparate events in other countries as a continuation of the 
civil war in Russia. I think that the horrible decision to kill 
the captured Polish officers (the "Katyn incident") was made in 
1940 precisely from the standpoint of the interests of "future 
socialist revolution in Poland." Neither should we forget that a 
certain component of the civil war also manifested itself in the 
Great Patriotic War. I mean the white emigration supporting 
Hitlerite occupiers, and the actions of Vlasov's and other 
nationalist units fighting on the side of the Wehrmacht. 
  Essentially, we gradually began to overcome the civil war 
mentality only at the time of Khrushchev's "thaw." The 
completion of this process mainly fell on the years of 
perestroyka, when Stalin's real political opponents (N. 
Bukharin, G. Zinovyev, L. Kamenev, and others) were exonerated 
and for the first time the question of the necessity of making 
peace with those who had fought on the side of the whites in the 
civil war was put on the agenda. At the same time, it would be 
wrong to believe that the civil war mentality has been 
eradicated once and for all. Unfortunately, the political and 
economic instability in which we currently live contains an 
inherent potential of its resurrection. 
  One of the most burning issues that attracts modern 
society's 
attention is: How do civil wars start? Sometime it is phrased 
somewhat incorrectly: Who is at fault in starting them? Asking 
the question from this angle essentially precludes the 
possibility of scientific analysis. Instead of studying the 
situations that lead to civil wars, people who phrase the 
question this way not so much attempt to find a serious, 
objective answer as to "brand" the guilty. And who exactly is to 
be branded, these people usually know in advance. So, for a 
researcher this approach is a dead end. In these conditions, I 
think, what we need to do is identify the most typical 
situations that lead to civil wars and look at each individually. 
  In my opinion, there are two basic situations that start 
civil wars. One of them is related to an upcoming revolution, 
and the other is not. 
  To start with, I would like to recall what Pitirim Sorokin 
once said. "The fall of a regime," wrote Sorokin, "is usually 
the result not so much of the efforts of revolutionaries as of 
the growing decay, helplessness, and inability to perform 
constructive work of the regime itself" (P.A. Sorokin. "The Long 
Road." Moscow, 1992, p. 37). I think the key word here is 
"constructive." In other words, in theory any revolution is 
preventable. But for this the government must undertake certain 
("constructive") reforms that would remove the social tension 
that accompanies a revolution in the making. Because of "decay, 
helplessness, and inability to perform constructive work," 
however, neither the last government of the imperial Russia nor 
the Provisional Government found in themselves the strength to 
implement the necessary changes. And since the accelerating 
events required action, it found an outlet in the attempts at 
armed suppression against the people--more energetic in February 
and much less active in October. Therefore, in such a situation 
it is the government's actions that usually provide an impetus 
for armed confrontation. 
  Naturally, I anticipate objections. Let us say, I can hear 
some people saying, that you are right with respect to February. 
But in October everything was different. The Bolsheviks were the 
ones who engaged in the most preparations for armed 
struggle--that is, the opponents of the existing regime--while 
the Provisional Government only defended itself, and even that 
it started doing too late. All this is true, but if we look 
attentively at the course of events, we will inevitably come to 
the conclusion that had it not been for the indeed weak and 
generally meaningless efforts at armed resistance on the part of 
the Provisional Government, the transfer of authority probably 
would have proceeded peacefully, without armed clashes, and 
therefore could not be considered as one of the episodes of the 
civil war. Politically, in the eyes of a considerable part of 
the socially active population the Provisional Government by 
then was doomed--this is confirmed in the memoirs of most 
contemporaries, with the exception probably of A. Kerenskiy and 
those who shared his views. Thus, there was the possibility of a 
peaceful transfer of power, which was not realized. I can hear 
another objection: And what about the armed resistance of the 
defenders of the Provisional Government in Moscow and in other 
places? In this connection it is worth rereading the 
reminiscences of October in Moscow of one of the "White Guard" 
fighters, S. Efron. There people, too, by October were quite 
disappointed in Kerenskiy and his government; after the failure 
of Kornilov's offensive "nothing good" was in store for the 
country; the Provisional Government was characterized as the 
"damned Kerenskiy rule;" and quite understandably, Moscow 
supporters of the Provisional Government looked at the "White 
Guard" "with certain distrust or even apprehension," fearing a 
"counterrevolution" (S. Efron. "October (1917)." BOLSHEVO 
literary-cultural almanac, No. 2, Moscow, 1992, pp. 59, 61, 81). 
But as long as the Provisional Government remained in power, the 
chance remained that the country would turn to the right, to 
order and stability. The "White Guard" of Moscow acted in 
defense of this potential turn of events rather than 
"in defense of the Provisional Government." 
  The example above (when episodes of a civil war are directly 
tied to a revolution) may also be seen as a particular variety 
of a more general approach to the problem, when the situation in 
the country and society looks more stable. At the same time, we 
have to emphasize that civil wars do not start in an environment 
of social peace: One degree or another of social tension 
necessarily precedes civil war. But neither should we gloss over 
the difference between similar but still distinctly different 
situations. In the former, we are dealing with a struggle 
against a regime that has lost the real support of the 
population. In the latter--a crisis being experienced by a 
regime that enjoys the support of a considerable part of 
socially active population. This particular version of 
development of events is probably what we should look at 
attentively. 
  The question of the conditions in which a civil war may 
start 
was considered by Lenin in his article "The Russian Revolution 
and the Civil War," written in the first half of September 1917. 
Lately it is being widely quoted in the press, but to my best 
knowledge it has not yet become the subject of a special study. 
Usually, only a part of Lenin's thesis is quoted--I believe, in 
a form intentionally truncated for a certain political purpose. 
The only words picked out are that "only a Bolshevik union with 
the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks... would have made 
civil war in Russia impossible," and then on the basis of this 
the conclusion is drawn that the blame for the civil war rests 
with the Bolsheviks for their refusal to form such a union. 
  Here is, however, how the appropriate part of the article 
looks in unabridged form: "If there is a lesson of the 
revolution that is absolutely inarguable and absolutely proven 
by facts, it is only that only a Bolsheviks union with the 
Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, only the immediate 
transfer of all power to the soviets, would have made civil war 
in Russia impossible. Because a civil war started by the 
bourgeoisie is unthinkable against such a union, against the 
deputies of the soviets of workers, soldiers, and peasants; such 
a "war" would have not progressed even to a single battle..." 
(V.I. Lenin. Complete Works, Vol. 43, p. 222). And further on: 
"The bourgeoisie's resistance to the free-of-charge transfer of 
land to the peasants, to similar transformations in other 
spheres of life, to just peace and a break with 
imperialism--such resistance is of course inevitable. But to see 
such resistance spill over into civil war, you need at least 
some masses, capable of fighting and 
defeating the soviets. The bourgeoisie does not have such masses 
and there is no place it can get them from" (Ibid., p. 223). 
  As we can see, what is being abridged is the second part of 
the phrase, which essentially describes the conditions of 
entering such a union--that its participants would agree to 
transfer power to the soviets. And this is being dropped 
intentionally, since, as is known, the Bolsheviks not only were 
agreeable to forming a "homogeneous socialist government," but 
also themselves offered that other socialist parties join the 
Council of People's Commissars, but on one mandatory 
condition--that all the members of this government agree to be 
answerable to the soviets. It is this condition that the other 
participants in the negotiations, which were then conducted by 
Vikzhel, could not accept, and the idea of a "homogeneous 
socialist ministry" never got off the ground. 
  This discourse has only an indirect bearing on our topic, 
however, since in this part of Lenin's article the topic was the 
possibility of averting a "minor" civil war stemming from the 
transfer of power from the Provisional Government to the 
soviets. Much more important, in my opinion, is another part of 
the article in which it says that civil war may start in Russia 
only when the opponents of the revolution "have at least some 
masses, capable of fighting and defeating 
the soviets" (ibid., p. 223). I think that this is precisely the 
key to understanding the process of how a civil war begins. It 
is not enough for the authority to have active political 
opponents. Also necessary are masses willing to support them not 
only in elections but also by directly taking part in an armed 
struggle. That this thesis is correct is best confirmed by an 
analysis of the events of the first half of 1918. 
  Over the past few years a version that has become popular in 
our journalistic writing is that the disbandment of the 
Constituent Assembly at the beginning of 1918 was the cause and 
de facto beginning of the civil war. Meanwhile, the documents of 
the Social Revolutionaries Party--at the time the Bolsheviks' 
main adversary--and the memoirs of its leaders make it clear why 
the Social Revolutionaries did not respond to this act by armed 
struggle. At the time the Social Revolutionaries did not have 
enough popular support, without which it was hopeless to launch 
an insurrection. In these conditions, as the Social 
Revolutionaries' leader V. Chernov reminisced later, the party 
leadership "came almost unanimously to the conclusion that the 
Constituent Assembly should be written off as a lost cause in 
the capitals; what is left is to search somewhere else on the 
territory of Russia for a place that would invite the 
Constituent Assembly and offer it protection (...). Thus, in a 
natural way, the idea began to form to move the Constituent 
Assembly to the Urals-Volga region" (V.M. Chernov. "On the Eve 
of the Storm." New York, 1953, p. 368). The Brest peace treaty; 
the left-wing Social Revolutionaries walking out on the Council 
of People's Commissars; the intensifying disagreement among the 
Bolsheviks, Chernov continues, strengthened in the Social 
Revolutionaries' ranks the irreconcilable opposition to the 
Bolshevik dictatorship and the readiness to raise the banners of 
insurrection against them at the first opportunity" (ibid.). 
Right here, let us pay attention to the provisional "at the 
first opportunity." This indicates an awareness that even in the 
spring of 1918, in March-April, such an opportunity did not yet 
exist. 
  The situation had changed by the beginning of the summer of 
1918, when the policy of Soviet power in the countryside--to a 
large extent forced by circumstances--and the arbitrariness of 
its local organs caused acute discontent among the peasantry. 
The Urals Cossacks rose against the Soviet power; anti-Soviet 
riots spread over a number of areas in the Volga and Urals 
regions; and at the end of May the Czechoslovak rebellion began. 
"In these circumstances," writes Chernov, "in June 1918 the 
Volga regional committee of the PSR [Party of Social 
Revolutionaries] entered an alliance with the Urals Cossack Host 
for the purpose of liquidating the Bolshevik dictatorship and 
proclaiming the rule of the Constituent Assembly in the Volga 
and Urals regions. The (PSR) Central Committee... ratified this 
alliance agreement" (ibid., p. 373). 
  The events that followed are well known. On 8 June in 
Samara, 
occupied by Czechoslovak troops, the Social Revolutionaries 
formed a Committee of Constituent Assembly Members, which 
proclaimed itself the supreme authority in the country and began 
an armed struggle against the Soviet power. Mobilization into 
the "People's Army" was announced, and some time later the 
country was sliced apart by the first front of a "major" civil 
war. 
  Now perhaps it is time to summarize the above. Usually, a 
civil war (with the exception of the instances of recent 
revolution described above) is started by forces that are in 
opposition to the existing regime, and only in circumstances 
when they are certain of success (or at least hope for such 
success). Without such an assumption, civil wars are not 
started. In 1917 many groups hoped to win: the initiators of the 
demonstration in April; the participants in the Petrograd 
rebellion in July; General Kornilov in August; the participants 
in the battles against establishing Soviet power in Moscow in 
October-November hoped for help from the Headquarters and the 
Cossacks; and so on. Sometimes such an appraisal of the 
situation is justified (for instance, in April 1917, when mass 
demonstrations resulted in the final analysis in the formation 
of a coalition government with the participation of the 
socialists). In other instances hopes for victory were crashed. 
However, the outcome of the events in many respects was 
predestined by the popular attitude to the participants in the 
action. 
  It is no secret to anyone that the danger of a civil war 
also 
exists today. It is associated with the social tension that is 
growing in the country as what the West calls the "social 
security net" disappears, the standard of living declines, and 
the threat of mass unemployment grows. And the only way to avert 
a social explosion, and with it a civil war, lies, in my 
opinion, not in constitutional drafts but in such steps in the 
area of the economy and social policy that would remove social 
tension in society. If, however, at the same time we continue to 
contemplate only to what extent these steps are in line with 
"free market ideals" and the values of "world civilization," we 
may miss the opportunity, while civil war in some form or other 
will, alas, loom inevitable.

Disavow"] 
  [Text] Military aspects still dominate Russian-American 
relations even following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Russia inherited from the USSR the lion's share of its nuclear 
potential, as well as the entire Soviet-American infrastructure 
of control over armaments, along with corresponding obligations, 
rights, and responsibilities; it inherited the Soviet doctrines 
and concepts regarding the use of nuclear weapons, balance of 
forces, stability, etc. 
  No less important is that which Russia is attempting to move 
away from, to disavow. First of all, this includes the political 
foundations of interaction with the United States in the nuclear 
sphere according to the confrontation-rivalry model, which 
determined both the development of USSR military potential and 
its approach to control over nuclear arms. President B. Yeltsin 
stated that Russia would like to consider the United States its 
ally, not a competitor-enemy, and would prefer to see 
international relations develop overall without the 
participation of weapons of mass destruction. Secondly, this 
relates to the Soviet style of elaborating and adopting 
decisions on nuclear weapons matters, which used to be 
characterized by centralism and secrecy. 
  In addition, the Soviet Union was a stable state, a factor 
that created favorable conditions not only for the deployment of 
weapons, but for the conclusion of agreements on arms reductions 
as well. But today Russia must confront the numerous 
consequences of the collapse of the Soviet state and 
manifestations of instability in the regions. 
  Right alongside its new measures, Russia put the American 
side in quite a difficult predicament, moving it towards equally 
radical changes in military policy. The future of 
Russian-American relations, including in matters of armaments, 
depends therefore to a great extent on the desire and capability 
of both sides to try to find a suitable balance between 
continuity and innovation in this sphere. To what degree can the 
experience of the Cold War period be retained, and what should 
be rejected? This article makes an attempt to find answers to 
these questions. Special attention is devoted to three aspects: 
evolution of the strategic nuclear balance in the world; 
different variations of the strategies of Russia and the United 
States; the future of control over nuclear arms following the 
end of the Cold War. 
<H5>  The Changing Nuclear Landscape </H5>
  The main attributes of one configuration or another of the 
strategic nuclear balance in the world should include not only 
the number of states possessing this variety of weapon and their 
hierarchy in the "nuclear club" (by size and scale of arsenals 
of the means of destruction and protection), but chiefly their 
military-strategic orientation along the ally-enemy spectrum. If 
we consider all the attributes of configuration of the balance 
of nuclear forces in their aggregate, it can be asserted that 
fundamental changes in the qualitative respect have not yet 
taken place--for Russia's security in any case. 
  All nuclear weapons systems belonging to the United States, 
Great Britain, France, and China, as well as those located in 
the former Union republics of the USSR, have retained their 
previous orientation on the whole, although the number of 
targets for destruction in their territories is decreasing, and 
do not exist at all today in the territory of former Warsaw Pact 
allies of the USSR. As before, the nuclear weapons systems of 
the United States, Great Britain, and France are aimed mainly at 
targets in Russia. Their relationships as allies have been 
preserved and efforts are being made to strengthen them. At the 
same time, the entry of Russia into NATO is problematic, to put 
it mildly. 
  Although large-scale in application, the START I and START 
II 
Treaties first of all have not been implemented; secondly, they 
do not affect the main foundations of the balance of nuclear 
forces in the world. The changes that took place following the 
end of the Cold War affected the former Soviet nuclear potential 
to the greatest extent, and the treaties on reductions did not 
play the most important role here. As a consequence of the 
collapse of the USSR, the reliability of this potential was 
placed in doubt, i.e., guarantees of executing combat missions 
in retaliatory operations, as well as its safety and security, 
consisting primarily of the capability to impede unauthorized 
access to nuclear weapons systems and prevent accidental launch 
resulting from technical malfunctions or errors in the chain of 
command and control. The nuclear potential transferred to 
jurisdiction of the Russian Federation lost a portion of its 
weapons systems and security systems (in particular, tracking, 
early warning, command and control), facilities of the 
production and testing base, and means of launching spacecraft. 
True, as opposed to Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, Russia can 
replenish these insofar as it is denied peripheral elements, but 
not central ones. However, this requires time and assets. 
Maintaining the state integrity of the Russian Federation and 
restoring the high degree of combat readiness of its army will 
obviously also mean preserving the basic international standing 
of the Russian state as a nuclear power. 
  At the same time, preconditions have today taken shape for 
changing the configuration of the strategic nuclear balance in 
the world. These consist primarily of the political nature of 
relations between the two leading nuclear states--the United 
States and Russia--and their abandonment of rigid confrontation. 
These circumstances place on the agenda the question of a new 
military-strategic orientation of nuclear potential, that of the 
United States and its NATO allies first of all, but also that of 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Political declarations 
on their part are clearly insufficient. In order to effect a 
true rejection of military confrontation, and not just its 
mitigation, it is necessary to bolster political and diplomatic 
steps through appropriate measures in the sphere of trade and 
economic relations and in the specific plans of the military 
departments. If the previous policy of targeting and selecting 
priorities and programs for the development of systems of 
nuclear destruction is maintained in principle, then political 
relationships too will not be void of ambiguity and will perhaps 
become reversible. It is clear that the qualitative improvement 
of relations cannot be limited just to diplomatic steps and 
quantitative reductions in armed forces and armaments. 
  But if the policy of the United States and Russia in 
selecting targets for destruction and in planning the military 
application of nuclear weapons changes radically, who then will 
replace Russia as the main objective of United States' nuclear 
restraint and on what scale? And if a suitable candidate is not 
found, what then is to be done with the nuclear arsenal? Time 
and colossal assets are necessary for its destruction. And if 
the American leadership finds a worthy candidate for the role of 
power to be restrained, will the United States and its allies be 
able to ensure the efficacy of restraint with respect to other 
states seen as a threat to the territory and interests of the 
NATO countries? Serious fears exist on this account insofar as a 
great deal depends on the perception of U.S. actions in other 
countries which may be unprepared for the system of already 
established values, rules, and conventions of confrontation. 
  Most likely, according to tradition, Russia will remain for 
the time being the main objective of nuclear restraint on the 
part of the United States and NATO, which means we will continue 
to see the status quo in the configuration of the strategic 
nuclear balance in coming years. 
  China may be thought of as another premise for change in 
this 
configuration, if its policies come to rely on narrowing the gap 
between it and the leaders, building up the combat capabilities 
of its nuclear potential according to qualitative or 
quantitative parameters, expanding its involvement in regions 
and spheres of international relations which presuppose 
confrontation with other nuclear states, and finally, 
consolidating security guarantees as a result of the possible 
reorientation of former USSR allies against the last powerful 
bastion of socialism. Ukraine might move the Chinese leadership 
in this direction if it succeeds in achieving the status of 
nuclear power, insofar as China would then be shifted from third 
to fourth place in the hierarchy of the "nuclear club." Not 
having nuclear allies and being limited in its choice of 
military strategy alternatives by virtue of technological lag 
behind Russia and in particular behind the United States, it 
could rely on building up its own arsenal of nuclear forces. It 
seems, however, that this supposition will remain unfulfilled. 
In evaluating the prospects, it should be taken into account 
that the United States and China have already established broad 
economic ties, and despite his preelection statements, President 
Clinton has extended the law affording China most favored nation 
status in American-Chinese trade. Relations with Russia are also 
intensifying, although it should not be forgotten that neither 
broad economic ties nor diverse political and diplomatic 
contacts provide a guarantee of prevention of military 
confrontation. Such a guarantee can only consist of commonality 
of national interests, a fairly extensive sphere of their 
overlap. 
  An important premise for changing the configuration of the 
strategic nuclear balance is impairment of the regime of control 
and nonproliferation. Interaction between the leaders in Moscow 
and Washington has its own prehistory in the establishment of 
this regime. They achieved very great successes here. At the 
beginning of the 1960's, at the height of the Cold War, the USSR 
and United States were forced to acknowledge that not only was 
it necessary for international relations overall to restrict the 
number of states that might gain access to nuclear weapons, this 
also conformed to the particular national interests of both 
powers. The existing regime of nonproliferation is basically the 
result of bilateral efforts. The persistence of these efforts 
was a key factor, joining 140 states by 1990 within the 
framework of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
Despite extremely complex political relations, every year the 
United States and USSR coordinated their policies in this 
sphere. In 1989 the USSR and United States set about 
accomplishing measures to fight nuclear terrorism. 
  At the same time, the opinion developed by the beginning of 
the nineties that the efforts of both sides were insufficient to 
meet the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons--this could 
take place independent of the treaty. Certain countries--Israel, 
India, and Pakistan, in particular--did not subscribe to it. In 
fact, over the course of the entire Cold War period, a slow but 
undeviating preparation was seen to take place for entry of new 
members into the "nuclear club." Today it is not clear whether 
or not the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will remain in effect 
after 1995. Moreover, it is difficult to name with absolute 
confidence the precise number of nuclear powers. Contradictory 
trends are being seen. Certain "threshold" states which are 
regional rivals and centers of power have disavowed further 
development of their nuclear programs (Argentina, Brazil, the 
Republic of South Africa). This facilitates a lessening of 
tension on the whole in the regions in question and a diminution 
of the role of the nuclear factor in international relations 
outside the framework of Russian-American understandings on 
military issues. At the same time, other examples exist. In 
particular, M. Gur, Israel's deputy minister of defense, stated 
recently that in the event of a nuclear attack by one of the 
Arab countries against Israel, the nuclear strike in response 
would cause the aggressor significantly greater damage. 
Available information indicates that Israel possesses about a 
hundred nuclear rounds and the systems to deliver them. 
(Footnote 1) (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 8 June 1993.) There is no 
reliable data regarding the possession of such weapons by the 
Arab countries. It cannot be ruled out that confrontation 
between India and Pakistan, Israel and the Arab countries, or 
North and South Korea, for example, would contribute towards 
establishing several of them as nuclear states. 
  Do these prospects truly alarm the Americans, or is 
discussion of this topic just a means of proving that their 
nuclear weapons specialists and personnel on alert at launcher 
facilities are earning their keep? Both are true, apparently. Of 
course, a few dozen nuclear weapons available to India or 
Pakistan, Israel or North Korea, can hardly be considered a 
threat to American territory, even if intercontinental delivery 
systems are found for these weapons. The interests of the 
majority of "threshold" states are not anti-American in their 
orientation. Clearly they do not need to compete with the United 
States with respect to capabilities, or are not able to do so. 
  However, the point does not lie in the fact that disruption 
of the nonproliferation regime would make American territory 
more vulnerable or create a universal threat of nuclear 
blackmail. For the United States there would be a narrowing of 
the field of political maneuver, intervention, and resolution of 
regional problems on advantageous terms. For it is well known 
that U.S. national interests are not at all restricted to 
inviolability of its territory, population, and social system. 
These interests are significantly broader and extend far outside 
the boundaries of the United States. Therefore, the 
international relations situation that will prove stable for it 
will be one that facilitates progress for American political 
influence and capital and assists in securing a settlement of 
problems and conflicts that is advantageous to the United States 
and its allies. Naturally, the emergence of new nuclear states 
does not contribute towards the growth of American influence. 
Moreover, it may impede U.S. participation in international 
affairs and foreign policy initiatives and may increase risk, 
including by virtue of direct threat of eliminating American 
military facilities in allied countries. In this manner, 
opportunities for controlling and managing the development of 
crisis situations that the American administration considers key 
in ensuring stability are limited. In particular, North Korea's 
intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
has compelled the American side to make concessions, and in 
return for agreeing to remain within the framework of the treaty 
North Korea obtained the right to inspect American military 
facilities in South Korea. 
  For Russia the problem of nonproliferation is not so urgent. 
Why? First of all, retention of the regime of nonproliferation 
has been beset with a great many conditions of third countries 
which entail further concessions on the part of all veterans of 
the "nuclear club," including Russia. The matter is not 
restricted to cessation of nuclear testing. (Footnote 2) (In 
July 1993 Clinton stated that the United States would not renew 
testing unless another nuclear power did so. It is too early, 
however, to draw final conclusions with respect to the U.S. 
position insofar as the Congress has not repealed its previous 
decision on limiting the number of tests, and American nuclear 
arms proponents are exerting pressure on the administration in 
favor of continuing an abbreviated testing program.) But it 
seems that the latest (January 1993) treaty with the United 
States on nuclear weapons reaches the limit of Russia's 
capabilities in disarmament--this the result not so much of 
military-strategic factors as of domestic economic and social 
ones. It is not clear whether or not Russia will have the funds 
and resources necessary to fulfill obligations already 
undertaken, not to mention new ones. 
  Secondly, the prestige of Russia, having cut off almost all 
ties with its former allies, and its influence on international 
relations have been sharply curtailed as compared with what the 
USSR used to enjoy. Control over the development of situations 
in the "far" abroad and actively effecting their settlement do 
not constitute a priority goal of Russia's strategy. The United 
States is interested in this to a far greater degree--expansion 
of the "nuclear club" is for it tantamount to reduced American 
influence on the neighbors of new nuclear powers. 
  Thirdly, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea, and other 
candidates for official membership in the "nuclear club" are not 
directly in conflict with Russia. These powers can effectively 
use the nuclear trump card only on the regional level, in 
rivalry with their neighbors in whose direction their nuclear 
warheads are primarily aimed. Those political and military 
efforts of China or Pakistan, for example, which have an 
anti-Russian orientation (exporting civil war out of Afghanistan 
to the territory of the former USSR, supplanting Russia and 
expanding their own zones of influence through direct or 
indirect penetration into former Soviet republics), are carried 
out mainly through third countries. Nuclear weapons can help 
them very little in their relations with Russia, and this is 
perfectly understood by all. Nor can Russia rely solely on the 
nuclear factor in resolving these problems. It will apparently 
have to travel along the same path the United States has taken, 
long ago orienting itself on increased attention to conventional 
weapons and general-purpose forces, to means of command and 
control based on advanced military technologies, to intelligence 
and communications, etc. While nuclear potential will remain for 
both Russia and the United States "the final argument." 
  Ukraine, and to a certain extent Kazakhstan, present a 
common 
concern to them, insofar as a portion of the Soviet nuclear 
arsenal remains on their territory. The problems these states 
have, going through the difficult period of establishment, 
create compelling motivation for the acquisition of nuclear 
status. At the same time, they do not fully possess the 
technical, production, or operational capabilities of becoming 
nuclear states. This is impossible without assistance from 
Russia. But such assistance can be afforded only under 
conditions of relations with these states as allies. This has 
broadened somewhat President Yeltsin's opportunity for flexible 
policy. It is not the United States but Russia that could become 
an equalizing influence in American-Ukrainian relations if it so 
desired and exert significantly greater influence on the 
international postures of both sides. 
  However, it is especially difficult to foresee all the 
consequences of this right now. After all, the basis for 
cooperation between the United States and Russia on the old 
principles of rivalry have already become outdated, and a new 
basis based on partnership has not taken shape. Cooperation 
between Russia and Ukraine has also not been formulated as yet. 
Therefore, in the interests of a positive continuation of 
international relations and in their stability, it is necessary 
first of all to devote greater attention to control over 
armaments and to expand the circle of participants in this 
process. 
  Activation of the mechanisms of control over all varieties 
of 
the weapons of mass destruction will probably show greater 
resolution in revealing shifts in the configuration of the 
balance of forces in the world and will define areas of 
heightened risk. 
<H5>  Variations in Strategy of the United States and Russia </H5>
  Concern over bipolar nuclear parity will apparently shift to 
the background in the coming period. The concept of strategic 
stability reflected in practical terms in the START II Treaty 
may become the basis--officially or unofficially--for 
construction of the nuclear potentials of both the United States 
and Russia. This means that the era of nuclear rivalry between 
the two powers has entered the stage of extinction. At the same 
time, the era of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
including nuclear weapons, is only beginning, it seems. 
Apocalyptic predictions regarding so-called "nuclear pygmies" 
dictating terms and blackmailing the rest of humanity are 
perhaps exaggerated, but it is necessary today to limit this 
risk based on a new level of cooperation in efforts between 
Russia and the United States. 
  Is such a new level of cooperation indeed possible? If we 
are 
talking about a fundamentally different basis of cooperation not 
just of allies, but of partners formally striving to avert 
confrontation, this is possible only if a radical review of 
targeting policy takes place so that American and Russian cities 
and other facilities are not the targeted objectives of the 
nuclear missiles and strategic bombers of both sides. Without 
such in-depth changes, or at least some parallel movement in 
this direction, it is difficult to discuss a new era of 
cooperation. It is important to take note of two circumstances 
when examining this question. 
  First of all, a great deal regarding cooperative efforts of 
the United States and Russia in the nonproliferation sphere 
depends on what role will be played by nuclear weapons in the 
world as a whole, and especially in the national security 
strategy of the United States and Russia as the most powerful 
nuclear states. There are many contradictory tendencies in this 
sphere of policy. On the one hand, it is clear that nuclear 
weapons cannot be a response to all threats, or even the 
majority of them. They are not viewed as the universal means of 
achieving national security strategy objectives, including those 
of the United States and Russia. However, both Clinton and 
Yeltsin emphasize in their official statements the important 
role of the nuclear potentials of their countries, allowing it 
to be understood that they have no intention of harboring a 
nihilistic attitude towards these under today's conditions. 
(Footnote 3) (Annual Report to the President and the Congress, 
Department of Defense, Wash., 1993, p. 4-6, 15; KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 
11 June 1993. (Speech of President of Russia B.N. Yeltsin to the 
leadership of the Russian Federation Armed Forces.)) If both 
states move definitively away from confrontation with one 
another--which presently has not yet taken place, as already 
noted--but preserve their number one and two positions in the 
hierarchy of the "nuclear club," the end of the Cold War will 
then lead to a consolidation of nuclear multipolarity. The 
remaining members of this club, especially countries of the 
Third World, with which China categorizes itself, will view new 
generations of American and Russian strategic offensive and 
defensive systems in the best case as a guarantee against 
devaluation of their strategic potential. But in the worst case 
scenario, they will evaluate this as a direct threat, for which 
it will be necessary to find appropriate countermeasures. The 
premises will have been created for a resumption of the nuclear 
arms race with adjustments for a new configuration of power 
centers. 
  Secondly, if the United States and Russia radically alter 
the 
military-strategic orientation of their nuclear arsenals with 
respect to each other and do not cling to nuclear leadership 
here, there are grounds to hope that the acquisition or build-up 
of nuclear potential will not become the military policy aim of 
third countries. 
  It is difficult to be optimistic, however, for a number of 
reasons. Even in the event of ratification of the START II 
Treaty by the United States, Russia, and other former Soviet 
republics, its implementation will take a decade. During the 
course of this period of time it is entirely realistic to expect 
scientific-technical breakthroughs in the military sphere in the 
largest countries, including developing countries. Then towards 
the beginning of the 21st century the prospect will arise of a 
narrowing of the gap between the United States and the most 
powerful regional centers of power. This is contrary to American 
interests. Officials in the American administration have 
asserted that the Pentagon's maintenance of indisputable 
technological superiority continues to comprise an extremely 
important objective of U.S. national security policy. (Footnote 
4) (Annual Report...1993, p. VIII, 15.) The Americans will 
continue to maintain and build up their scientific and technical 
reserves in the arms race. And it is possible the nuclear 
orientation will not be the fundamental one for them. 
  Whereas for other states, including U.S. allies, supporting 
an advanced level of military technology in all the main 
orientations and setting the tone in the selection of priority 
orientations is hardly an attainable objective by virtue of the 
far greater limitations in their scientific-technical and 
financial resources, as compared with the United States. 
Especially since a timely reorientation on nonnuclear aspects of 
the arms race would be difficult to achieve for the less 
powerful and less developed states. Those in this category that 
have at least some sort of reserve of their own will either 
continue along this path or they will withdraw, rejecting 
independent participation in the arms race no matter what the 
sphere of advanced military technology. 
  Understanding the possible benefits of this, including 
economic benefits, the Americans will obviously prefer to settle 
problems from a position of superiority rather than from one of 
self-restriction in the choice of means of exerting pressure. 
They can hardly be expected to themselves reject advantages over 
others, risking failure in negotiations with unyielding 
opponents, and find themselves without additional trump cards in 
the event of one complication or another. As a consequence of 
this, the nuclear factor in American national security strategy 
will lose its weight not so much depending on improved relations 
with Russia and a weakening of Russian might as much as on the 
extent to which the United States secures new achievements in 
the sphere of arms and acquires alternative, more flexible means 
of guaranteeing its national interests. 
  Taking these perspectives into account, a narrow, egoistic 
variant of U.S. foreign policy is entirely realistic. Such a 
variant may be aimed at securing interests of the moment even at 
the risk of endangering international stability. This does not 
mean a return to isolationism in its pure form. Here the United 
States could conduct an active foreign policy, but on principles 
of unilateral advantage, in the interests of broadening its 
spheres of influence in the Third World, including to the 
detriment of Russia and even its own allies. Even following the 
end of the Cold War the United States has been using the 
multipolar balance in Eurasia with the aim of playing on the 
contradictions among various power centers in the region. The 
result of such a policy would be further disintegration of the 
security system and extreme imbalance of the strategic 
equilibrium. In this event, certain traditional bastions of 
tension in the regions will spread out over the ruins of the 
bipolar system and control of armaments will have limited 
significance for all entities of international relations. How 
will this influence Russian policy? 
  Having confronted American egoism and lost its status as a 
superpower, Russia will likely lose interest in the bilateral 
process of control over armaments and will instead prefer some 
kind of variety of "nuclear isolationism," meaning complete 
independence in the strategic sphere. In the event of such a 
choice, Russia will follow in the path of France in the 1960's. 
Not being in any condition to play according to the rules of the 
nuclear superpowers, Paris totally rejected these rules. 
  If Moscow follows this path in the middle of the nineties, 
the United States may then remain the one nuclear superpower 
without partners in negotiations and without support in the 
matter of nonproliferation. Such a variant seems more probable 
for Russia, insofar as new orientations of the development of 
U.S. nuclear potential relying on qualitative parameters with 
respect to command and control, intelligence, and defensive 
systems have gradually undermined the significance of parity 
among the nuclear powers as the basis for negotiations on 
nuclear arms. As a result, other criteria are being brought into 
the calculation in the adoption of decisions concerning Russia's 
defense, the most important of which are qualitative parameters 
of nuclear forces as a guarantee for inflicting a responsive 
strike. Taking these into account during the course of 
negotiations is quite problematic in practical terms. 
  There exists a probability under today's conditions that 
Russia will undertake unilateral measures to reduce its Armed 
Forces and will change their structure. This is not so much a 
question of unilateral reductions in nuclear potential as much 
as the independent selection of a path of development of 
strategic forces and the rejection of duplication of the 
American weapons systems. 
  Another variant of American foreign policy can be termed 
collectivist. This presumes that the United States will not 
separate its own security interests from the security interests 
of its allies and the entire world community. In this regard, 
the basic aim of the United States will be to form an 
international security structure of the "greater Europe" 
variety, capable of stifling the numerous destabilizing impulses 
of a chronically unstable South. 
  Of course, U.S. national security policy will in reality not 
be a clear-cut choice between the first and second options. More 
likely this will be a flexible combination of elements of both 
depending on the political situation in the country and in the 
world. 
  In a number of his speeches, new U.S. President Clinton has 
stressed that his administration is proposing participation in 
collective efforts to guarantee security. In the event 
collective measures do not conform to the national interests of 
the United States, however, they will prefer to act as they see 
fit. An example of this can be seen in the American position 
with respect to the crisis in Yugoslavia, where the United 
States did not agree with Europe concerning maintaining an 
embargo on arms shipments to the Islamic community, and sent a 
military contingent to Macedonia as well. In this manner, a 
claim was made on the role of equalizer with respect to German, 
Turkish, and Russian policy in the Balkans, opportunistically 
taking advantage of the "Islamic factor" which the United States 
always uses to frighten the Europeans and Russia. 
  In analyzing the tendencies that are taking shape, we can 
presume that it will be increasingly difficult to support the 
collective principle in the realization of U.S. national 
security strategy, even within the NATO framework, and the 
nuclear doctrine of the bloc as the embodiment of this principle 
will probably be subject to a durability test, insofar as the 
ground is disappearing beneath its feet. 
  The technology factor may also come to play its role here. 
It 
seems that with the technical complexity and high cost of 
antimissile defense systems and new military technologies of 
offensive weapons, not all the nuclear powers will be able to 
possess these, and over the course of 10-20 years a more precise 
delineation will come about within the "nuclear club" between 
first-class powers--which possess advanced technologies and 
capabilities in command and control, communications, 
intelligence, accurate delivery of nuclear weapons, and use of 
defensive systems--and second-class nuclear powers--which do not 
possess such capabilities. 
  France and Great Britain may organize closer cooperation 
even 
without the United States in developing a new generation of 
offensive and defensive systems. Certain allies of the United 
States are already attempting to lessen their data and 
information dependence on the Pentagon. In particular, France is 
focusing attention on improving and perfecting its information 
and intelligence service by developing its own space-based means 
of observation and by creating new intelligence organs, 
processing and analysis centers, and data and information 
distribution centers. 
  Evolution of the strategic nuclear balance in the direction 
of "regionalization" could accelerate European military 
integration and gradually destroy the Atlantic partnership. It 
should be noted that up until now the Europeans have not gotten 
very much out of cooperation with the United States in the 
sphere of SDI-related technologies, although their support for 
this program permitted the Americans to obtain decent political 
dividends during the period of the Cold War with the USSR. 
  Another question that will have an effect on formation of 
the 
infrastructure for cooperation between the United States, 
Russia, and other powers in the sphere of control and 
nonproliferation consists in whether or not nuclear weapons will 
be used directly or indirectly in possible conflicts between the 
North and the South, concerning which much is now being said. 
Will it be at all possible to depend on nuclear weapons to 
contain regional conflicts, especially without using them a 
single time for appearance sake, as was done by the United 
States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? 
  Unless the North withdraws from participation in conflicts 
of 
the chronically unstable South, nuclear weapons may become an 
important factor in North-South mutual relations, other 
effective means and methods of exerting influence being lacking. 
For Russia this unfavorable prospect may acquire special 
significance, insofar as it borders directly on the most 
explosive regions of Asia. 
  The build-up of tension in relations with the Third World 
contributes towards accelerating the regional arms race in the 
South. The industrially developed countries of the North may try 
to use against the South the same strategy that was used by the 
West against the USSR during the Cold War period: a nuclear 
threat to prevent the possible employment of conventional or 
nuclear weapons. It is not ruled out that under these conditions 
Russia will privately be viewed by them as an outpost, similar 
to the way Germany was a foothold of NATO in the confrontation 
with the East. True, the given scenario is not very probable 
since it does not conform to the interests of Russia, which must 
not permit the victors in the Cold War to use it as a battering 
ram or cannon fodder in their policies with respect to countries 
of the South. However, deliberate and selective arousal of the 
"Islamic factor" with the help of the American intelligence 
community may put Russian diplomacy in a quandary when it is 
forced either to resort to brute force for assistance or to give 
up its positions--as is now the case in Tajikistan. In any 
event, the Islamic card plays a role of no small significance 
in--as was stated in the latest U.S. Department of Defense 
report--"not permitting the emergence of a new global threat to 
the United States, similar to the Soviet threat." (Footnote 5) 
(Ibid., p. 3, 4.) 
  This can hardly be expected to strengthen the foundations of 
cooperation between Russia and the United States in control and 
nonproliferation.

1993"] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
  During January-November 1993 the volume of foreign 
trade turnover in Russia (not including the CIS countries), 
taking into account the estimate of products shipped in and out 
by private individuals, was $69 billion (Footnote 1) (The 
estimate was done on the basis of information from countries 
that are Russia's trading partners. According to official 
sources, Russia's foreign trade turnover was $53.0 billion, 
including exports--$35.4 billion and imports--$17.6 billion.) 
and increased by 0.8 percent as compared to January-November 
1992. 
  Russia's exports were equal to $41.2 billion and 
increased by 14.2 percent, including to industrially developed 
countries--$24.7 billion, increasing 17.0 percent; to developing 
countries--$5.8 billion, 56 percent; and other countries (former 
CEMA countries, the republics of the former Yugoslavia, China, 
the DPRK, and the Baltic countries)--$10.7 billion, and they 
decreased by 4.9 percent. In November 1993 exports of products 
amounted to $4.2 billion or 3 percent more than in November 
1992. Exports (according to official sources) of the most 
important goods during 11 months of this year were characterized 
by the following data: 


                      Quantity         Value,           In % of 
                                       millions of      January-November 1992

  The prevailing tendency in foreign trade was expansion of 
the 
scale of exports abroad of natural resources (timber, petroleum 
fish), ferrous metals, mineral fertilizers, and electric energy 
against a background of reduction of exports in a number of 
other commodity groups. 
  Imports during January-November 1993 amounted to 
$27.4 billion, which in current prices is 14 percent less than 
during the corresponding period of 1992, including from 
industrially developed countries--$17.0 billion (a reduction of 
16 percent); developing countries--$5.2 billion (an increase of 
26 percent); and other countries--$5.2 billion (a reduction of 
31 percent). During November 1993 $2.9 billion worth of goods 
were purchased through imports, or 5 percent less than during 
November 1992. The reduction of imports was determined by the 
reduction of the amounts of centralized import operations. 
  Imports (Footnote 2) (According to official sources) of the 
most important goods during January-November 1993 were 
characterized by the following figures:

  Purchases through imports of fresh potatoes, wheat flour, 
soy 
oil, leather clothing, and fur clothing decreased more than 
10-fold. 
  There was an increase in the imports of butter (73 percent), 
citrus fruits (84 percent), and natural rubber (2.2-fold) but 
this was related to the low volumes of procurements of these 
products last year. 
  Russia's foreign economic ties with its main trading 
partners 
during January-November 1993 were characterized by the following

  The foreign trade balance during 11 months of 1993 was 
positive in the amount of $13.8 billion (for the corresponding 
period of last year it was positive in the amount of $4.1 
billion). 
  The balance of payments of Russia (not including 
the CIS countries) during January-November 1993 was 
characterized by a positive foreign trade balance and growth of 
foreign assets of commercial banks and state reserves of Russia:

  PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS. As compared to 1992 the influx 
of foreign investments into the Russian economy during 1993 
increased, although it remained insignificant as compared to the 
demand. Its declared volume exceeds $400 million as compared to 
$290 million in 1992. The number of registered enterprises with 
foreign capital (PII) will approach 12,000, that is, it will be 
approximately double what it was at the end of 1992. 
  The investment of capital by foreign companies did not 
develop in a uniform way throughout 1993. A certain increase in 
investments during the summer period was followed by a decline 
beginning in October of this year as a reaction to certain 
political events: although the number of enterprises registered 
with the RASMiR [expansion not identified] in October stayed at 
the September level--390, the volume of declared investments 
dropped almost 10-fold (from $115.7 million to $13.8 million). 
In November of this year 442 enterprises with foreign capital 
were registered, whose volume of declared investments amounted 
to $65.3 million. 
  During the course of the year there was a sharp change in 
the 
ratio between investments of Russian and foreign partners: 
During the first half the foreigners' share of the declared 
authorized capital remained stable at an average of 52.5 
percent. During the subsequent period (July-August) it increased 
significantly--to 75-80 percent, and during October-November it 
decreased to 36 percent. 
  The development of the aforementioned tendencies is 
predetermined above all by the crisis condition of the economy 
and also the instability and imperfection of the legal base for 
foreign investments and entrepreneurial activity as a whole. As 
before, it is mainly small enterprises that are being created. 
  In spite of the doubling of the number of enterprises 
operating with foreign investments (to 6,239 as of 1 November) 
their share in the volume of industrial production is reaching 
no more than 2.5 percent, although their significance in the 
sphere of foreign economic activity is growing: according to 
estimates, during 10 months of this year they accounted for more 
than 6 percent of Russia's exports and about 13 percent of 
imports. 
  The activity of enterprises with foreign investments is 
beginning to have an effect on the solution to the problem of 
employment: the number of people working at these enterprises as 
of 1 November of this year was 274,000, an increase of 110,000 
individuals as compared to the beginning of the year. 
  The branch priorities chosen by foreign capital investors 
and 
their Russian partners largely fail to coincide with the 
priorities of the structural policy of the Russian government. 
They are drawn mainly to the sphere of services and are not 
adequately represented in machine building, particularly in the 
production of science-intensive products. At the same time in 
1993 foreign investments were more actively attracted to the 
sphere of conversion of enterprises of the defense industry, 
above all the aviation industry and the production of means of 
communication and medical equipment. In the volume of oil 
production, enterprises with foreign capital account for 3 
percent. 
  In the second half of 1993 there were signs of a livelier 
interest on the part of foreign partners in the process of 
Russian privatization of state and municipal enterprises, 
although the mechanism for attracting them remains imperfect in 
this case. Foreign firms or, on their instructions, Russian 
legal entities purchased blocks of shares in privatized 
enterprises of the tobacco, food, sewing, chemical, and certain 
other branches of industry. As a rule, the foreign firms are 
obligated to make large investments in modernization and 
expansion of production capacities. 
  Thus the German concern Siemens acquired 10 percent of the 
shares in the Kaluga Turbine Plant and in August 1993 concluded 
an agreement with it for cooperation in the production and sale 
in Russia and abroad of steam turbines with a capacity of up to 
35 megawatts. The transnational corporation Proctor and Gamble 
intended to acquire at an open trading session 14 percent of the 
shares in the Novomoskovskbytkhim Joint-Stock Company, the 
largest producer of means of chemical dry cleaning in the CIS. 
Over five years the corporation has invested another $50 million 
in this joint-stock company in exchange for an additional 
proportion of the shares. The English company Illingworth Morris 
purchased 49 percent of the shares in the Bolshevichka factory, 
the largest in Russia. The firm is investing 3.64 million pounds 
sterling in technology, personnel training, and licensing. The 
Swiss firm Nordwest AG has acquired 20 percent of the shares in 
the Cherepovets Amofos Joint-Stock Company and has made a 
commitment to invest about $8 million in this enterprise. 
  The entry of foreign banks and insurance companies into the 
Russian financial market became more active in 1993. 
  On 27 September of this year the president of the Russian 
Federation issued Edict No. 1466 "On Improvement of Work with 
Foreign Investments." The edict earmarks a program of measures 
for stabilization of the legal situation of foreign investors, 
considerable improvement of the activity of federal 
administrative organs in this sphere, the development and 
adoption of state programs for stimulating an influx of foreign 
capital into priority branches, and so forth. Thus real 
preconditions are being created for a marked improvement of the 
Russian investment climate. Preparations are being completed on 
proposals for making changes and additions to the Law "On 
Foreign Investments in the RSFSR" and the Laws "On Concessions" 
and "On Free Economic Zones." 
  It should be emphasized that against the background of the 
overall decline of industrial production in the country, many 
enterprises with foreign capital managed to increase their 
production in 1993. Thus during the first three quarters of this 
year as compared to the corresponding period of last year they 
increased production as follows: oil (including gas 
condensate)--1.9-fold, secondary aluminum--twofold, and 
steel--43 percent. There was a significant increase in the 
volume of production of a number of consumer goods, especially 
sewn and knitted items. At the same time the output of footwear 
and fabrics decreased. There was a marked increase in the 
production of bakery items, meat and sausage items, and frozen 
fish. At the same time the decline in production in machine 
building did not bypass enterprises with foreign capital: the 
production of trailers for motor vehicles did not increase. In 
1993 there was an appreciable increase in the output of personal 
computers--2.8-fold. 
  The influx of foreign investments into the Russian economy 
is 
modest in scale and clearly does not correspond to the potential 
demand for them or the capabilities of the world investment 
market, where competition from other capital recipient countries 
is becoming stiffer. 
  The RUBLE EXCHANGE RATE, which is established according to 
results of trading at the MMVB [Moscow International Foreign 
Currency Exchange], after stabilization during the first 10 days 
of November, began to drop gradually and by the beginning of 
December amounted to 1,231 rubles per U.S. dollar as compared to 
1,181 rubles at the beginning of November. The demand for 
foreign currency exceeded the supply, which brought about a 
reduction of the ruble exchange rate. The volume of sales for 
November exceeded 1.6 billion rubles and increased by 29.5 
percent as compared to October. By the end of the year a certain 
increase in the ruble exchange rate is expected in connection 
with the end of the fiscal year, which is confirmed by trading 
at the beginning of December.

*Predicted 


  The figures for 1992-1993 show parity of buying power is 
coming closer to the ruble exchange rate. The ruble exchange 
rate was 9.5 times greater than the parity of buying power in 
1992, and in 1993--5.3 times greater. 
  FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NEARBY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
This year, as in preceding years, mutual deliveries are not 
providing for the fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements. 
Still suppliers of the Russian Federation are fulfilling their 
commitments to their partners in nearby foreign countries at a 
higher level. The dispatch of fuel resources, the main commodity 
exported from Russia, during 11 months of this year amounted to 
65-90 percent of the annual volumes. Coal delivery was ahead of 
schedule (160 percent). 
  Deliveries from Russia to CIS countries were fulfilled 
during 
the 10 months of this year for oil--by 63 percent, gas--73 
percent, gasoline--84 percent, diesel fuel--58 percent, and 
furnace fuel--71 percent. 
  Deliveries of meat, cooking salt, and sugar from the Ukraine 
were fulfilled during this period at a level of 12-52 percent. 
Delivery shortfalls of MAZ and BelAZ trucks from Belarus 
amounted to 40 percent, and meat and meat products--44 percent. 
Of the 3 million tonnes of grain envisioned under the agreement, 
Kazakhstan delivered more than 800,000 tonnes and there were 
considerable shortfalls in the deliveries of wool, synthetic 
fibers, and nonferrous metals. During the aforementioned period 
the cotton growing republics of Central Asia delivered to 
enterprises of Russia 60 percent of the amount of cotton fiber 
(about 500,000 tonnes) that was supposed to be delivered on a 
mutually coordinated basis. 
  In certain cases the delivery shortfalls were caused by the 
refusal of Russian enterprises to purchase products from nearby 
foreign countries because of the excessively high prices for 
them. 
  The regulation of mutual settlements and payments is of 
decisive significance for the development of economic relations 
with CIS countries. 
  The indebtedness of the CIS countries on state credit 
granted 
to them by Russia exceeds the Russian debt by 2.3 trillion 
rubles (approximately $5 billion). Moreover, the debt of 
enterprises and organizations of the CIS countries for goods and 
services received (according to figures as of the beginning of 
November 1993) exceeds creditor indebtedness by 3.5 trillion 
rubles. Of this sum, 1.5 trillion rubles is from indebtedness to 
enterprises of the fuel and energy complex.

<F P=106> [Speech by Minister of Foreign Affairs A.V. Kozyrev on 3 </F>
November at the Foreign Policy Council under the MFA of the 
Russian Federation] 
  [Text] I will make a couple of introductory comments and 
share our concerns and what we would like to consult with you 
about; naturally, this will not be an exhaustive presentation--I 
will only outline a list of topics. 
  Unlike many of the USSR's allies in the "Third World," East 
Europe remains, and, I think, will remain our priority. They are 
unlikely to provide material or political support for our, as we 
call it, "red-and-brown" opposition. 
  Our ties with East Europe and the incident with 
ratification--or, to be precise, failure to ratify--a treaty 
with Hungary is very indicative in this respect. In essence, not 
only East Europe but also the administration of the Russian 
Federation president and the government of Russia found 
themselves in a position of hostage in a political 
score-settling. After a number of attempts, the treaty with 
Hungary was never ratified only because the preamble formalizes 
the universally known and long-obvious fact that the 
interference in Hungarian affairs in 1956 was impermissible, 
albeit in a form that does not impose any legal or other 
obligations on Russia. I think this was a manifestation of the 
still-lingering syndrome that has its roots in the old 
ideological approaches when one not only could not write but 
even was not supposed to know the truth about the events in East 
European countries. 
  We should have drawn certain conclusions from this "ostrich" 
position. I remember a situation in this very Collegium 
Conference Hall--at the time of the USSR MFA--when the meeting 
chairman said, flabbergasted and, I would say, indignant, that 
our embassies did not maintain contacts with precisely such 
forces, such persons, although they were known to the entire 
world--for instance, Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel--apparently 
counting up to the very last moment on a sort of emulation of 
"perestroyka" occurring instead of an all-out anticommunist 
revolution taking place in these countries. 
  Meanwhile, the problems encountered by young leaders and new 
elites in the East European countries were in essence our 
problems, too. These include reform of the bureaucratic 
apparatus--whether economic, of the Gosplan [State Planning 
Committee] type, enforcement structures, or the foreign policy 
agencies. I say this with a degree of criticism at ourselves. 
The difficulties of privatization and commercialization. And 
finally, aggressive nationalism, a mix of envy and arrogance in 
relation to the outside world stemming from the inferiority 
complex that society feels to a certain extent. As a result, 
Russian diplomacy in East Europe had to start in many respects 
not just from ground zero but from a negative point, and all 
this in an environment of disruption of economic ties. 
  Today we can say that we have completed the first stage--the 
stage of establishing new relations between the new Russia and 
the revitalized states of East Europe, keeping in mind, of 
course, all the difficulties. The highlight of this stage was 
clearing the debris of the socialist camp era and creating in 
general a new foundation of political--and on this basis, 
mutually beneficial economic--ties. This encompasses first and 
foremost the political-legal base. Although, of course, the real 
mechanisms still leave a lot to be desired, but this apparently 
will constitute the core of the next stage, that is, realization 
of all the political opportunities that have opened as a result 
of the first stage. 
  High-level visits by the president of Russia to practically 
all the East European countries and his meetings with the 
leaders of these states have resulted in the signing of a new 
generation of treaties and agreements. Troop withdrawal from 
Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary has been accomplished in a 
civilized way. The pages related to the interventions of 1956 
and 1968 have been turned for good. The final chapter has been 
written in the Katyn affair; a number of other "blank"--or, to 
be precise, "black"--pages in history have been brought to light. 
  It is important both for us and for East Europeans to first 
look into the future; second, to orientate ourselves at those 
things that bring us closer: the communality of democratic and 
free market aspirations, the desire to live in a stable Europe, 
and the need for mutually beneficial economic ties. It is in the 
interests of Russia to have East Europe as a bridge rather than 
barrier to West Europe--without dismissing, of course, the 
inherent value of ties with East and Central European countries 
per se. 
  Both we and these countries have actually set for ourselves 
the same strategic task: to take our proper place in the "club" 
of developed democratic states. The question is how to deal with 
this task through cooperation rather than elbowing one another 
aside. It is clear that we cannot forbid anyone to join NATO. 
The time of "Brezhnev doctrine" diktat has been consigned to 
oblivion together with the Soviet system in our country. I think 
our friends in East and Central Europe should move from 
fostering suspicions regarding some sort of new designs on the 
part of Russia toward a joint search together with us for 
answers to complex issues of modern times. 
  Yes, we do not like expansion of NATO without Russian 
participation, even if it is not aimed against us. In this we 
are achieving understanding. Evidence of that is the American 
concept "Partnership for Peace," supported by many NATO 
countries. We can count on new relations with the West 
withstanding the trial by Central and East Europe in the sense 
of their membership of NATO. This will be further proof of 
political shortsightedness on the part of those who try to 
juxtapose partnership with the West and that with the East. One 
is hardly realistic without the other. I will be even more 
blunt: Without timely and persistent orientation toward alliance 
with the West, it is unlikely that Russia would have been able 
to avert the expansion of old and formation of new exclusive 
political blocs not only along the perimeter of CIS countries 
but possibly also closer to the external borders of the Russian 
Federation. Only a partnership with the West, the special 
relations established with leading NATO countries, make it 
possible to withstand the "trial by East and Central Europe"--I 
use this term again today, with all possible reservations, in 
the sense of joining the North Atlantic bloc. 
  This is the real worth of the clamorous accusations of 
Westernism coming from the position of so-called patriotism. It 
is also clear, however, that we can only keep up with East 
Europeans if we ourselves move decisively along the road of 
domestic reforms and open foreign policy. We must, in 
particular, engage more actively in giving content to such ideas 
as "Partnership for Peace" or the "Balladur Plan," including 
from the angle of our relations with East Europe. 
  We welcome fresh ideas and initiatives that would help us 
all 
together to reinforce the trust between Russia and the countries 
of Central and East Europe, including through joint actions, 
especially in peacekeeping. The relations between East European 
countries by themselves combine both the elements of competition 
and rivalry and the desire for integration. To a certain extent 
we will be able to use such subregional cooperation structures 
as the "Vicegrad Four" and the "Central European Initiative" in 
order to solve problems of interest both to us and to the 
countries of East and Central Europe. Which are: combating 
aggressive nationalism, protection of the rights of national 
minorities while preserving the integrity of the state, and so 
on. 
  Our diplomatic efforts in the East European direction will 
be 
academic unless they are reinforced by the development of 
economic cooperation. So far we clearly have not utilized to a 
full extent the favorable conditions we have created at the 
political level, especially considering that East European 
countries also have an objective interest in restoring economic 
ties. I must say that now that the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations has a new leadership it will be possible to deal with 
these tasks with much greater success than was the case with 
their predecessors. 
  In this area we are working in several directions. First, it 
is time to implement already existing bilateral agreements; 
second, we need to search for new forms of cooperation on the 
level of entrepreneurial structures. The question is how to give 
a boost to the restoration of civilized ties which in the end 
will displace the barbaric, mafiosi forms on one hand, and on 
the other, will not lead to a situation whereby in order to 
implement the agreements signed by the governments we would have 
to resort to old administrative methods. Third, the possibility 
of trilateral cooperation is of interest: West Europe--East 
Europe--Russia, with the participation, of course, of other CIS 
countries. All this, however, on condition that this will be a 
partnership of equals rather than attempts to solve one's 
problems, for instance, at the expense of Russia by receiving 
financial infusions from the West and dumping on Russia goods 
that are not quite competitive otherwise. 
  An important special feature of the Soviet Union's relations 
with countries of East and Central Europe, with all their 
ideological shackles, was that contacts between people, 
particularly between scientific organizations and cultural 
institutions, were quite extensive. Today much of this is in 
jeopardy. We have to try not to lose, try to preserve cultural 
and spiritual ties. The scientific and cultural intelligentsia 
could play an important role in this. We will support 
inter-church ties in every way possible. This is the spiritual 
background of contacts with a number of countries of East and 
Central Europe. 
  We need to encourage and find new forms of cooperation at 
the 
Russian regional level, including through such 
structures--created with MFA participation--as the Organization 
for Cooperation of Baltic and Black Sea Basin Countries. 
  In all these matters we count on the active participation of 
the new democratic parliament. I must say that we are longing 
for a parliament that will legislatively regulate our 
activities, direct them with the help of laws, and oversee both 
us and other state agencies, including those working with East 
and Central Europe. There are many other problems--especially in 
the CIS zone--where the legislative base and parliament's 
oversight functions are especially needed, even though foreign 
policy and activities have been and will remain the president's 
prerogative. By the way, none of the countries of East and 
Central Europe--and the scale of their problems fades in 
comparison with ours--attempted to experiment with an annual 
vote of confidence in a popularly elected president or early 
elections of the president. The experience of a two-year 
parliamentary term in one of the countries also proved less than 
satisfactory. In our country, in my opinion, instead of 
painstaking work, such experiments bear the mark of 
irresponsibility and a Bolshevik penchant for extremism. 
  I would like to call on all of you to use all the tools at 
our disposal. We have a democratically elected president; we 
will have a democratically elected parliament. Let us use these 
institutions as a base and work normally for four or five years, 
including in the area of East and Central Europe. Otherwise 
everybody will indeed abandon us and turn to NATO. 
  The significance of East and Central Europe for Russia is so 
great that the development of relations with East European 
countries should be not so much the business of the diplomatic 
community as of our entire state organism and society as a whole. 
  I hope that today's discussion will offer both criticism and 
analysis, and most importantly, will be fruitful and enrich us 
with new ideas.

editor in chief of the VOPROSY ISTORII magazine. 
  The comments of the participants in the discussion are 
published below in abridged form. 
  O.T. Bogomolov: It was good to hear today from the 
minister's mouth that the region of East, Central, and Southeast 
Europe (for brevity we will use East Europe) should have 
priority in our policy and that we should pay more attention to 
it and direct more effort into the development of relations with 
the countries in that region. The facts bear witness that until 
recently this region held, unfortunately, a place far from honor 
in our policy; a number of circumstances--perhaps 
objective--distracted our attention to somewhat different areas, 
and we underestimated East Europe from the standpoint of its 
geopolitical location and its significance for the security of 
Russia and our trade and economic interests. 
  I agree with the minister's very correct remark that for us 
this region serves as a bridge to Europe--moreover, to the 
world. East European countries are closer to West Europe and 
they have more experience in establishing relations; besides, 
our communications--both transportation and other kinds--with 
the West and the world go through this region. 
  It was also correctly noted that we have common problems of 
postcommunist development. It is true that East European 
countries are somewhat ahead of us, and their experience--both 
political and economic--is very valuable. Had we paid more 
attention to what is happening in Poland, the Czech Republic, 
and Hungary instead of looking only at models of American 
liberal economics, perhaps we could have avoided many extremely 
grave consequences of the "shock therapy," which generally is 
not working in our country. 
  It is precisely among the specialists in East European 
countries that we frequently find understanding of our 
difficulties. They do in-depth research of many sides of this 
transition period. We, on the other hand, frequently deal with 
very superficial, shallow judgments of specialists from the 
International Monetary Fund and other Western scholars. 
  Speaking about this region, I would like to emphasize not 
only the communality of problems but also the not-yet-lost 
personal ties, the experience in contacts. We should not forget 
that, for instance, in the eastern part of Germany there are 
probably at least several hundred thousand people who speak 
Russian and know our reality well, not to mention the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where many people know us well, 
speak Russian, and are easy to communicate with. 
  It seems to me that East Europe is also seriously 
underestimated from the standpoint of its importance as a market 
for our industry, for our economy, and from the standpoint of 
being a supplier of many products. These ties have been 
disrupted, which is fraught with serious difficulties, if not 
more than that, for a number of sectors of our economy, 
especially in transportation, since half of our means of 
transportation, especially rail transport, came in the form of 
rolling stock and locomotives made in Germany, the Czech 
Republic, and Poland. The disintegration of these ties 
jeopardizes the operation of our transportation sector. 
  In this respect it should be noted that we are aware of 
moral 
liability to these countries--both on the part of the former 
USSR and perhaps our own. It is a fact, after all, that hundreds 
of thousands of workers are finding themselves laid-off at 
enterprises in the Czech Republic and eastern part of Germany 
because we cut off the economic specialization ties set up by 
the former Soviet Union. We can no longer afford to buy electric 
locomotives which used to be the specialty of Czech 
factories--we cannot pay for them because the price of each 
electric locomotive is now up to 2 billion rubles. 
  We should also keep in mind that we are seeing a more active 
policy on the part of the United States of America, the 
countries of the European Community, and especially Germany, in 
the East European region, aimed at bringing it into their sphere 
of influence, which creates a certain danger of our isolation. 
There are many comments by Western public figures regarding the 
way they see this region from the standpoint of their interests 
and how much they would like to prevent the restoration of 
Russian influence in East Europe. 
  We at the institute draw the following conclusion from the 
above: Russia must considerably energize its policy in the 
direction of East Europe with the aim of restoring disrupted 
neighborly relations, strengthening mutual trust, and finding 
new forms for cooperation and security guarantees. 
  I am very glad to see what the government and the Russian 
Federation MFA are doing in this direction; this includes visits 
by the Russian Federation president, and other initiatives; of 
course, this is all useful. However, in our opinion, we are 
still facing a score of unresolved issues both in the area of 
East European security and in the area of development of 
regional economic cooperation. 
  The leadership, the diplomatic community, the mass media, 
and 
the Russian public must show not only in words but prove in deed 
that we are interested in the success of free market and 
democratic reforms in East European countries, that we are 
interested in studying this experience. We also have to show 
that we will not be a source of threat to their independence and 
freedom. 
  Now about the new mechanisms and institutes guaranteeing 
security in the region. I think that the all-European 
process--which, according to Western propaganda, is allegedly 
being moved increasingly more to the back burner, and perhaps 
interest in it is waning--must nevertheless be promoted by us as 
one of the most important priorities, because resolution of the 
issues of our own security and security guarantees for East 
Europe is linked with the further development of the 
all-European process. We also have to admit the fairness of 
Western criticism which maintains that documents on the 
all-European process do not have any institutional support. Yes, 
in this respect perhaps NATO has a number of advantages. 
  Still, in my opinion, initiatives in the area of common 
European security are necessary, and we have to have our own 
position. Perhaps it would be more advantageous for us now to 
place a certain emphasis on improvement of all-European 
institutions within the framework of the Helsinki Agreements, or 
put forward our idea of a certain transformation of NATO 
stemming from the fact that the alliance is posed to expand its 
membership. 
  In my opinion, the most important aspect of our relations 
with East Europe is economic. The East European market is very 
valuable for us, because both the Czechs and the Poles are 
willing to buy many items we produce. And vice versa, we also 
need what they produce very much--I already mentioned means of 
transportation; if our transportation sector grinds to a halt, 
it will mean the collapse of our economy. Therefore, we have to 
look for a solution. To think that such solutions have already 
been found on the basis of intergovernment agreements would 
probably be an overestimation of their significance, since these 
agreements do not entail any specific obligation. In our country 
obligations are now the province of enterprises--they deliver 
the product, and they buy it. 
  For the past two to three years our institute has been 
attempting to explain to the government the possibility of 
setting up a special mechanism for settling accounts with East 
European countries, because the clearing method of the past had 
a number of shortcomings. We proposed a system of combining in 
one large mechanism both trade and clearing functions on the 
basis of multilateral barter. It appeared to gain support, but 
it turned out to be very difficult to see this idea through to 
the end. 
  There used to be Comecon, which in good time, and probably 
for good reason, was disbanded. Still, the need for regional 
ties remains. We have attempted to create such a body on the 
basis of private business--the International Organization for 
Promotion of Regional Cooperation. The institute made space and 
some money available to launch this organization. We recently 
conducted a meeting of representatives of central banks from 
near abroad and East European countries in order to boost these 
contacts and exchange information. It would be desirable to have 
the government's assistance in creating--perhaps, no longer at 
the government but rather the public level, or with the 
participation of businessmen--such organizations as could pick 
up where we left off after the elimination of Comecon. We have 
to look for new forms--not the kind that have discredited 
themselves, such as Comecon or the Warsaw Pact--but different 
ones that would facilitate the development of this regionalism 
with our participation. 
  A.O. Chubaryan: I think that bringing the issue of 
East Europe to the consideration of the council is extremely 
useful. In my opinion, Russia's position with respect to East 
Europe has a bearing on a more general problem--the concept of 
Russian foreign policy, on one hand, and on the other--the new 
configuration in Europe as we approach the 21st century. 
  I agree with Andrey Vladimirovich's opinion that we have 
passed the first stage with respect to East Europe--clearing the 
debris; but as always, there is still something left. We are now 
entering the most difficult stage: defining new relations. There 
exists--although many would deny it--a certain resistance on the 
part of the West against restoring our positions in East Europe. 
I think that the next stage will be a protracted and hard one 
for us. 
  The first direction, as I see it, is bilateral relations. 
Signing agreements, and the very useful visits by the president 
of the Russian Federation, have created a foundation, but it 
seems to me that this layer is very thin and only the upper one. 
The entire infrastructure of Russia's ties with East Europe, 
destroyed as a result of the collapse of the regimes that we all 
had, resulted in the destruction of the old, but the new is not 
yet in place. We have to a large extent practically lost the 
ties we had with them along social lines. In this respect the 
minister remarked correctly on the human factor--the old 
generation is leaving the scene, and we are not establishing any 
ties with the new generation. Therefore, I think, the first task 
is to restore the infrastructure along all lines: cultural, 
scientific, and social. This task is not limited to the MFA--it 
applies to all organizations and structures. But the MFA should 
act as a coordinating organization in this regard. 
  The representatives of our new party are weak. The growing 
parties are eager to establish contacts within the framework of 
association of liberal parties and social democrats. But I have 
not heard or seen them establishing active contacts with the 
respective East European Christian or federal social-democratic 
parties. Something that is closer to home for me--science, for 
instance; in this respect contacts are extremely limited. This 
is a result of lack of money and, of course, a certain 
apprehension that exists in East European countries. Therefore, 
in my belief, this is a global direction that we should 
persistently pursue; we need to establish a new infrastructure 
of Russian-Polish, Russian-Czech, Russian-Bulgarian, 
Russian-Romanian, and other ties using all sorts of levers. 
  The second point, the second direction, is regionalism. 
Currently all Europe is gripped by a very active renaissance of 
regional ideas. Why would Russian diplomacy not advance new 
initiatives in this direction? I agree with the idea already put 
forward here that we need to use East European countries in 
order to give a boost to our ties with the West. I am convinced 
that restoration of the status of Russia as a great power will 
depend to a great extent on the place and influence we 
restore--or retain--in East European countries, not to mention 
CIS countries. We are not talking about the restoration of old, 
even allied relations, but it is quite obvious that we need to 
work in this direction. In this we need to use historic and many 
other traditions. Especially considering that, as we know, and 
as already emphasized today, the main hurdles have been cleared. 
  I think we need some kind of initiative line with respect to 
our "presence" in the resolution of various problems. We could 
probably use various political levers associated, among other 
things, with the security system. 
  I also believe that the all-European process is skidding 
because ideas sink into the sand. We probably should advance new 
ideas for the institutionalization of potential regional and 
common European security projects. In this respect I believe 
that the already mentioned "Balladur Plan" is interesting. But I 
will say frankly, Andrey Vladimirovich, that Russia already 
today, while it is getting to its feet, is capable of claiming 
its own plan of vision from Moscow. In the past we played a 
great role in creating an all-European system; perhaps now we 
should bring experts and politicians into this and propose our 
concept of Europe at the threshold of the 21st century. Our 
initiatives in these matters will increase both the general 
importance and significance of Russia in these matters. 
  And, finally and lastly: I think we should restore and 
expand 
some of the forms of cooperation with East European countries 
that existed in the past. I have in mind historical science. We, 
Russian historians, have already traveled our part of the road 
with respect to East European countries in the sense of 
admitting our mistakes. I believe that we could now return to 
the idea of reactivating certain joint projects with them 
involving historical traditions, summarizing the experience of 
cooperation with this countries. We are open to this; we are 
ready. I want to inform you that in the historical sciences 
alone we have already restored, at the initiative of Bucharest, 
a Romanian-Russian commission of historians, and at the 
initiative of Prague--a Czech-Russian commission of historians. 
We take a rather flexible position in our relations with them; 
we are agreeable to include in the research the issues they are 
interested in. We should help East European historians make use 
of our archives. This would be extremely useful. 
  Metropolitan Kirill: I would like to express 
gratitude for the opportunity for the Russian Orthodox Church to 
participate in the Foreign Policy Council, and for the new style 
of relations that has been established with the Russian Orthodox 
Church. 
  I would like to start from a perhaps unexpected premise. 
First, from the general tone of the document distributed to us 
entitled "Theses for Discussion." A certain axiom that is not 
questioned is built a priori into the basis of this document; 
this axiom may be described as follows. There is a strategic 
goal in Russia's foreign policy, which is formulated as the 
integration of Russia into the so-called civilized world, or 
Western world. Following that, everything we find in this 
document is tied to this goal. East Europe and Central Europe 
are seen through the prism of the extent to which our relations 
with East and Central Europe will further or hamper this 
integration. 
  I thank Andrey Vladimirovich for his introductory comments, 
which helped me to understand that at least in the MFA 
leadership, too, there are synonyms to the notion of 
"integration." I would like to insist that in terms of our 
domestic policy, in terms of the popular attitude to foreign 
policy activities of the government, it would be more correct, 
more psychologically correct, more politically appropriate, 
instead of the notion of integration to use those synonyms the 
minister suggested today in speaking of partnership, 
cooperation, and allied relations. And in this sense there is 
nothing new in Russian policy. The point is that all of us, 
being the children of the recent Soviet past, have been shaped 
by the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, whether we like it or 
not. And for us the notion of "allied relations with Russia" is 
something strange, is some kind of discovery, and for a very 
considerable spectrum of our social forces it is a betrayal of 
our national interests, because people still act on the premise 
of this short historic context delimited by the 75-plus years of 
Soviet power. But Russia is not 70 years old. It is almost more 
than 1,000 years old. Let us work on the basis of this 
historical context. 
  In this respect Russia has always had allied relations with 
the West (France, Austria, Germany), but nobody in Petersburg 
ever seriously entertained the thought that these allied 
relations assume Russia's integration into Germany, Austria, 
France, or West Europe. Therefore, I think, we need to 
understand the following. 
  Sometimes terms we use rather frivolously--and this also may 
be the result of our Soviet education--are not meant to convey 
any particular ideas, but those who listen to us often interpret 
these terms in a way detrimental to us. I am deeply convinced 
that Russia's foreign policy today does not assume such 
integration into West Europe that could jeopardize the value of 
Russia in its own right as a great Eurasian state. But the use 
of the term "integration," especially in the context of 
integration into the civilized world--it is very hard to 
understand what exactly this means. As if Russia with its 
1,000-year culture is not part of the civilized world. Well, it 
is better to avoid this phraseology. I would like you to 
understand me correctly: This comment is linguistic, not 
political, in nature, but since terminology in politics is a 
matter of some importance, I would like to insist that we use 
correct terminology in putting together the documents coming 
from our foreign policy agency. 
  Now on substance. Can we seriously speak of integrating 
Russia into West Europe--let us agree that for the moment we are 
using this term in the good sense of the word, in the sense that 
Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy, France, and Germany are 
integrated into Europe? I think we should ask a serious 
question: To what extent is it justifiable at all to speak of 
such a goal? Whether we like it not, Russia is a fait accompli; 
it is the result of 1,000 years of historical development. It is 
not merely a country--it is the immense Eurasian continent with 
a colossal, unprecedented potential in both material and 
intellectual resources. It is another matter that Russia 
currently is in a position of extreme hardship, and that we may 
speak of some degeneration of our potential. But a lot of time 
will have to pass before Russia degenerates. And I am convinced 
that this will never happen. So we are indeed talking about a 
colossal potential. 
  The question arises as to whether this colossal potential 
can 
be integrated into the Western economic and political system in 
such a way that it would be first acceptable for the Western 
system, and permissible in substance for Russia. I think not. 
Russia will never be integrated in the Western system the way 
other countries are integrated in it because Russia is Russia; 
because Russia stretches from Kaliningrad practically to 
Chukotka; because Russia is an immense Eurasian community. In 
the same sense one cannot speak seriously of integrating the 
United States into West Europe. Such integration also will never 
happen, despite the existence of a communality of political 
interests, but with respect to economic interests I do not think 
there is any particular communality, although economists would 
be in a better position to comment on this. And that is not to 
mention cultural antagonisms. 
  Speaking of Russia's relations with the Western world, we 
need to speak of cooperation, partnership, and even allied 
relations, although every time we should think through very 
carefully what exactly we mean by allied relations. 
Nevertheless, the arguments presented by Andrey Vladimirovich 
greatly impressed me. That is, we do not know what would be 
happening now in the geographic regions of the CIS had we not 
registered at this stage our allied relations with Western 
countries. This is a very strong argument. This does not mean at 
all that we should be allies always and under any circumstances. 
Politics is a dynamic and flexible business; at some point we 
may be allies, at some point our views may diverge and relations 
cool. But most importantly, Russia must remain a geopolitical 
center, which it always will be. Moreover, the world needs it. 
  In the context of this line of thinking let me touch on 
Central and East Europe. First, it has been correctly noted here 
that we have neglected East Europe. This has been a terrible 
hypocrisy. On one hand we kept saying that they were our 
brothers and allies, that this was the socialist camp. But let 
us put it straight: In reality Soviet foreign policy's attitude 
to East Europe was contemptuous. 
  Soviet policy divided the world into first- and second-class 
countries, and the tragedy, lies, and ambiguity of our position 
were that the USSR's allies were in reality considered 
second-class countries. I must confess the church's sin as well. 
This imprint, this pressure of political ideals was reflected in 
church affairs as well. We worked on building relations with the 
United States, with Greece, but we forgot that there were 
Bulgarians. We believed that they, our brothers, would always be 
there. If one takes the calendar of foreign relations activities 
of the Russian church for those years, unfortunately, events 
along the line of relations with East Europe took last place, 
even after Africa and Asia. 
  It was put quite correctly here that what happened in East 
Europe is our moral liability, sin, and fault. Now it is 
necessary if not to set East Europe apart as a special priority 
then at least to place it at the same level in our relations 
that we have placed West European countries, the United States, 
and Japan. 
  In this connection I wanted to mention that we, in our 
church 
activities, are planning a number of substantive actions. As is 
known, during his visit to our country the president of Hungary 
invited the Holy Patriarch to visit. There are invitations from 
Catholic Poland. In addition to the Holy Patriarch's visit to 
Hungary, we plan trips to Poland, as well as Yugoslavia and 
Bulgaria. We want very much to correct the imbalance that has 
existed in our church's policy with respect to East European 
countries. 
  I would also like to note that if Russia becomes attractive 
to East Europe, all the problems in our relations will be 
resolved. What would make us attractive? Domestic political 
stability, and the resolution first and foremost of economic 
problems. We will not be attractive today by selling them cheap 
raw materials. Then they will say that Russians remain, as they 
always have been, poor politicians. We must maintain a dignified 
position in both the economic and political spheres. 
  S.B. Stankevich: What is Central, East, and 
Southeast Europe for Russia now? So far there is no sound and 
consistent vision or systematically formulated answer to this 
question. The "Brezhnev Doctrine," which was mentioned here, is 
a thing of the past; what do we have to replace it? Apparently 
not the "Monroe Doctrine," as the press has been writing and the 
corresponding suspicions voiced, including by the Western press. 
Apparently, something else. And perhaps, in continuation of the 
philological research proposed here by Metropolitan Kirill, we 
should resurrect such a term--not at all bad--as "vital 
interests." 
  Truly, this is a sphere of vital interests of Russia; there 
is no better word for it, and hardly anyone will argue with 
this, because we are linked with this region by a thousand 
economic, spiritual, and cultural threads; the well-being of 
Russia or lack thereof depends if not 100 percent then to a 
considerable extent on what will happen here, and it is indeed a 
sphere of our vital interests. 
  The fact that we postulate our vital interests in connection 
with East Europe does not give us any special rights in this 
region. It means only one thing: In allocating our attention, 
cadres, resources, and efforts, including diplomatic ones, it is 
substantially more important than the esteemed and respected but 
far more removed countries. Although all of us here seem to 
agree that this is a priority for us, this priority for us must 
be expressed in a quite obvious and visible way. For instance, 
key issues--diplomatic cadres, resources, including those 
supporting the activities of diplomatic representations; time 
spent on it; the frequency and level of visits in both 
directions; the agreement-legal base that exists in 
relations--these are the visible expression of this priority 
standing which has been, quite appropriately, noted here. 
  We are about to close--I cannot say that we have already 
closed--a whole era of relations with this region. And it seems 
that we should close it in a dignified and significant manner. 
There is a dearth of program statements in this respect, 
essentially of doctrinal nature. Some sort of statement closing 
the entire era in relations with East Europe apparently is 
needed, in which we would summarize the past and define Russia's 
position as it enters a new era in relations. 
  Russia's responsibility for what was happening to East 
European countries during this nearly past era has already been 
mentioned here. But there are quite persistent attempts to turn 
this responsibility into a political and legal one. This we can 
hardly accept and agree with. It was not democratic Russia that 
invaded the Baltics in 1939, or sent troops into Hungary in 1956 
and Czechoslovakia in 1968. In my opinion, it would be 
completely incorrect to mechanically transfer the liability for 
what happened in the preceding era onto the current, democratic 
Russia. Yes, without any doubt in a moral sense we still have 
certain feelings and obligations. 
  All this, however, should not grow into a complex of 
national 
and historic fault, which multiplies in daily politics. For 
this, by the way, we need to close certain pages of history, 
specific episodes. The problem of historical episodes, concrete 
memorials, burial grounds, and cultural legacy is very 
important; it has considerable repercussions, is played out 
constantly in politics, and influences it. Therefore any 
incidents involving violation of military memorials or some or 
other artifacts of material and spiritual culture in some ways 
related to Russia--in such instances, I think, Russia's reaction 
should be sufficiently sensitive and diplomatic, but there must 
be a reaction, there cannot be none, for we are rapidly losing 
the status of a great power to be reckoned with. 
  As to various geopolitical combinations that are currently 
emerging, we can probably agree with the contention that it is 
not associations or blocs per se that are bad--it is, of course, 
their content. 
  Regarding the question of integration. I do not think that 
the word "integration" should scare us that much. It is another 
matter that integration into the civilized world sounds 
absolutely absurd and unacceptable. But integration, if we 
understand by it entry into a certain system of existing 
international relations--yes. Not integration with Germany, not 
integration with France, but integration into a certain system 
of interrelations. For this, however, Russia must become itself, 
become a state; clearly and firmly define its new role, its 
place, its interests; formulate them, because only such 
qualitative definitiveness can be integrated into something 
without dissolving in it. And Russia itself must decide with 
whom and to what extent, on what terms and in what forms it will 
integrate, meaning integration into the system of existing 
interrelations. Then in principle we can agree with the term 
itself; I do not think it should sound so threatening. 
  Now regarding NATO. Over the past few years, in trying to 
adapt NATO to currently existing realities in Europe and in the 
world, the NATO leadership has of course done a lot in the 
direction of changing the nature of this bloc, but its 
qualitative definition so far remains the same, despite recently 
adopted documents. It remains a military-political bloc, with 
the emphasis on the first part--military; it was formed and 
continues to exist on the premise that there exists a certain 
threat from the east, more or less real in some or other eras, 
but it exists, this constant threat from the east, for the sake 
of which this bloc must exist and function. There are thousands 
of different-level documents, not necessarily doctrinal ones, 
and various sorts of instructions, up to military regulations, 
that reflect the existence of this threat and in accordance to 
which NATO structures conduct their life, which have not been 
revised. And in this connection, since it is a dynamic process, 
it is important who is ahead. We can probably formulate this 
principle--that the restructuring of NATO's internal structure, 
the change in the internal content of NATO, should proceed ahead 
of the process of its geographic expansion. Most likely Russia 
will be unable to stop any East European state from joining NATO 
if it seriously wants to. The "Brezhnev Doctrine" should be left 
behind, but if anyone is interested in Russia's opinion, our 
position in this respect should be quite clear: We do not 
encourage this process; we do not wish to accelerate it; we urge 
caution and prudence in any change of balance. And it probably 
makes sense to insist that internal restructuring of NATO should 
precede the process of geographic expansion of this bloc. 
  Another point of substance in the discussion is our economic 
relations with East European countries. Yes, indeed, we need to 
restore what was destroyed by ignorance. But it hardly makes 
sense to limit ourselves to simple restoration of these 
technological chains that have been broken, now that workers are 
being laid off at factories that used to work for Russia. It 
probably makes sense to look a little beyond that. Principally 
new conditions have already come into play; the free market is 
not in place yet, but market relations have emerged in all East 
European countries, including Russia, and we need to make use of 
these relations. It would be quite logical to bring up the 
question that Russia can stimulate the movement of capital and 
goods to both near abroad countries and the states of East, 
Southeast, and Central Europe. 
  On cooperation between political forces. The paradox is that 
it is the left-wing and postcommunist forces that are 
pro-Russian in East European countries, while the greatest 
anti-Russian attitudes are most often noted among the democratic 
forces, which maintain that Russia should be left in the past 
altogether, since it brought them only grief and misfortune, and 
that they need to unilaterally orientate themselves toward the 
West. This sort of anti-Russian prejudice, common among 
democratic forces in East European countries, is to a large 
extent the fault of Russian democratic forces, which are not 
establishing direct contacts with them, not conducting intensive 
enough interparty exchanges with these countries, preferring to 
visit other places. Hence the complex of not understanding the 
new Russia, once again by inertia perceiving it as an imperial 
threat. Therefore, it is quite important to break this 
situation, to establish normal contacts with parties and 
organizations of democratic spectrum in East Europe, and this 
task may be encouraged and supported by the MFA. 
  A.M. Vasilyev: I would like to try to build a 
hierarchy of priorities and compare the significance of the East 
European region to other regions that are closer to me--the 
southern regions. I would build this kind of structure: In the 
first place, of course, are the near abroad countries; in the 
second--the West as a whole, including the United States; I 
would not put East Europe even in third place--I think more 
likely it should be China and the Far East; when we come to the 
fourth and fifth place--here we may have a certain competition: 
After all, East Europe is already separated from us by hundreds 
of kilometers of borders of several independent states. At the 
same time, right next to us there are states--I mean the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia--which are practically turning 
into the Near East, and their problems are overlapping our 
borders. 
  Russia's relations with these southern regions may compete 
with East Europe in importance and significance for Russia. And 
not only that. The Near East is inside us if we take into 
account that Russia is home to 8-9 million Muslims with their 
political, social, and other value orientations that are the 
same as the "Third World." 
  These regions to a certain extent are also linked to our 
relations with East Europe. Russia exports oil and gas, but in 
practical terms an increasingly greater part of that oil and gas 
is what we will be buying there, in the East, reselling ours to 
the West. That is, we are playing the role of a transit 
territory. And it is impossible to define our relations with one 
region without taking the other into account. 
  Russia's destiny is not to oppose the West, not to march 
against it, not be in confrontation with it; but we cannot 
become an integral part of the West even if we wanted to, 
because we are different, and Russia's historic destiny is 
different. In this connection I, as a person whose field is the 
"Third World," believe categorically that identification of our 
policy with the policy of the West could hurt Russia's interests 
in the "Third World." 
  Concluding my brief interference into the discussion of 
specialists on Europe, I would like to emphasize that we should 
not separate our relations with East Europe from the problems we 
face on our southern borders because of the special position of 
Russia--a gigantic country spanning two continents. Separating 
one from the other may lead to certain mistakes and 
miscalculations in Russian policy. 
  V.K. Volkov: I believe that in our discussion of 
the problems of East Europe and Russian policy there exists a 
general acute conceptual deficiency not on a regional but on a 
global level. Before we speak of a region, we should first look 
at the future, look not only at the way we and the world are 
today, but also imagine what the world will be in three to five 
years. We will not be able to peer too far into the future, but 
we could perhaps look at a span of 15 years. Perhaps then we 
will have a clearer idea regarding East Europe. 
  I think that today's world creates confusion in many heads. 
The bipolar arrangement has disappeared, but will the currently 
prevalent unipolar one survive? Unlikely. International 
relations are a self-regulating system, and it does not tolerate 
unipolar situations. One way or another it will begin to 
differentiate. And I will permit myself to suggest that in the 
near future we will witness a new disposition of international 
forces or, in short, several years from now the world will be 
very different from what it is today. And then we will indeed be 
able to define the place of East Europe in the system of 
priorities of Russia's policy. 
  In Russian history, the Central European direction--to be 
specific, Poland and Czechoslovakia, as well as the Balkans--has 
always been at the center of our diplomacy. Therefore, if we now 
look at this all in a new way, distancing ourselves somewhat 
from history and emotions, we will simply see that the role of 
Russia and its policy in East Europe is a litmus test that shows 
the real place of the Russian Federation in the world arena. 
  I think we need to see our potential strong points, bases in 
East Europe. Among the countries here that already now clearly 
lean toward political cooperation with Russia one can name the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. This is not 
only a legacy of the former socialist camp, but also restoration 
of certain traditional contacts. 
  As to our economic ties, they do indeed have their 
specificity. But at the same time we should not lose sight of 
the fact that the former Soviet Union has managed to build 
economic relations with East European countries in such a way 
that it has become an agrarian and raw material appendix to its 
own "satellites." 
  I completely agree with those who advocated here an active 
policy with respect to East European countries. This activism 
may be of very different varieties, but we probably should 
indeed push aside all fears and not be afraid to say loudly that 
we have interests in East Europe. I believe that the conduct of 
an active Russian policy should begin with deciding where there 
are grounds for it. I do not see a problem more important for 
Russia than halting economic sanctions with respect to 
Yugoslavia. They have turned into a complete absurdity.

historical sciences, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Far East Institute Center for Japan and Korea Studies: 
"Approaches of the Countries of Northeast Asia to the Problem of 
Ensuring Security After the Epoch of the `Cold War'"] 
  [Text] Many Russian and foreign researchers note that the 
beneficial consequences of the end of the "cold war" have 
seemingly not touched the extensive Asia-Pacific region, and 
primarily the region of Northeast Asia which is of vital 
importance for the Russian Federation. However, these statements 
bear a rather general character. Nevertheless, if we examine the 
situation in the region more closely, here too we may note some 
striking positive changes. First of all, this is reflected in 
the fact that, after many years of indifference to the Far East 
in Russia, a distinct foreign policy course for Northeast Asia 
has emerged for the first time. This course was formulated by RF 
[Russian Federation] President Boris Yeltsin during his visits 
to the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China in 
1992, as well as in the April (1993) "Foreign Policy Conception 
of the Russian Federation," which contains a section on 
Northeast Asia. 
  As for the United States of America, it was as if this 
region 
had remained at the back door of their geopolitical interests 
for a long time. They considered the Pacific Ocean to be their 
own specific lake, in which their national security was reliably 
guaranteed by a system of bilateral agreements. At the center of 
this system was the 1960 Japanese-American Agreement on 
Cooperation and Guarantee of Security. The treaties and 
agreements of the USA with the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the 
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and other countries were 
concentrated around it. Altogether, they comprised the firmly 
constructed so-called "American system of security," which, as 
Western political scientists maintain, brought Northeast Asia 
long-term peace, stability and economic prosperity. Quite 
recently, the Clinton administration also came to the conclusion 
that it was impossible to continue to live with the old baggage. 
The new world order persistently dictates the need for a review 
of the American position in the Asia-Pacific region and a 
transformation of the bilateral relations into some kind of 
multilateral structure or mechanism which would better 
correspond to the demands of the times. 
  In touching upon the Russian conception of security, we 
cannot overlook the article by the well-known scientist and 
China specialist, Dr. B. Zanegin, which was published in PRAVDA 
on 13 August 1993 under the title, "The `Cold War' Still 
Continues." In this article, he attacks the foreign policy 
course of the Russian Federation which stems from the 
above-mentioned conception. The author comes to the conclusion 
that Russia's diplomatic activity in Northeast Asia in practice 
"amounts to the implementation of an unfriendly, and even 
hostile, essentially confrontational, policy in regard to the 
socialist countries parallel to or in conjunction with the USA 
and other anti-communist regimes, and to gross intervention by 
Russia in the `cold war' in the Asia-Pacific region." [1] 
  After such a statement, one wants to ask how such a 
respected 
researcher risked negating all of Moscow's efforts in stepping 
up diplomacy in this geopolitical direction, which is so vital 
to it? The question arises, does Dr. Zanegin understand what 
constitutes Russia's national interests in this region? If so, 
he would hardly characterize Russia's foreign policy as "being 
built on the dogmas of anti-communism and synonymously oriented 
toward the USA." [2] 
  In fact, an unprejudiced analysis of Russia's "foreign 
political conception" speaks of the fact that it emanates from 
the general national interests of the Russian Federation, which 
consist of the following: 
  --in domestic policy, which is given a priority direction: 
Preservation of Russia as an integral, free, independent and 
democratic state, and for this it is first of all necessary to 
normalize the management of the state; Preservation and 
formulation of an economic space for business interaction within 
the framework of the former USSR; Stabilization of the economy 
and finance, creation of a socially oriented market economy, and 
ultimately the achievement of economic prosperity; Step-by-step 
implementation of conversion, with international support; 
  --in foreign policy: Maintaining the country's defense 
capability at the necessary level and ensuring its external 
security; Developing friendly political and mutually beneficial 
trade-economic ties, communiations and humanitarian exchanges 
with all states on a global and regional level, including 
especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where Russia has a rather 
extensive marine boundary; Preserving a stable and safe peace in 
the regions, including Northeast Asia, and on the planet as a 
whole; Constructive participation in the activity of the UN and 
other international organizations. 
  As we can see from this far from complete list of Russian 
interests, and simply to list them would take up several journal 
columns, it is unlikely that anyone would be bold enough to 
formulate them in full volume. Almost all of them are directed 
at ensuring internal stability and achieving prosperity of a 
multi-national state. This constitutes their basic difference 
from the confrontational foreign political doctrine of the 
former USSR of the "cold war" times. However, the Russian 
Federation does not deny in any aspect its geopolitical and 
strategic role in the Asia-Pacific region, and on the contrary 
intends to actively participate in all measures of this 
extensive region, including also in the creation of a reliable 
mechanism for ensuring collective security. However, this 
certainly does not mean that it is pursuing a confrontational 
policy. 
  What new challenges are being presented under current 
conditions to the states of Northeast Asia, including Russia, 
which oppose the national interests of the countries in the 
region and the prospects of creating a reliable system of 
collective security? This is primarily the emergence of 
tendencies toward hegemonism in the world arena and in the 
region. Here too we should mention the regional and ethnic 
conflicts also taking place within Russia and in its nearby 
foreign countries; the retention of existing and desire to 
create new closed military-political unions; and the 
presentation of territorial claims by a number of countries to 
other states. This concerns also the rather controversial 
Japanese encroachments on the so-called "northern territories" 
belonging to the Russian Federation. Undoubtedly, this list must 
also include the existing limitations on free trade and the 
obstacles to exchange of leading technologies. Although 
assurances were given at the July "Summit of the Seven" [G-7 
summit] in Tokyo that the limitations imposed by CoCom 
[Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] in 
regard to Russia would be removed before the end of the current 
century, Moscow could not help but feel that the same mistrust 
is being exhibited toward it as had been during the period of 
the "cold war," whose rudiments are still seen in many things, 
but in any case not in the policies of the Russian Federation. 
  Any form of ideologization of interstate relations is also 
one of the varieties of new challenges which must be overcome by 
current diplomacy. Russia, as we know, does not speak out 
against the bilateral agreements existing in Northeast Asia 
which comprised the system of security for the USA and its 
allies in the period of the "cold war." At that time, this 
system, evidently, was justified. However, under the new 
conditions, after the end of the "cold war," a real need has 
arisen for the parties to declare in some form in the 
Japanese-American "security pact," which is central in the 
system of alliances in the region, that henceforth it will not 
be directed against other countries of the region. This is the 
will of the times! 
  To the list of new challenges we should add: The drug trade, 
expanding terrorism, piracy, as well as another legacy of the 
"cold war"--the continuation of large-scale joint training 
exercises by naval and other types of armed forces near the 
territories of other states. 
  The probability of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and 
other means of mass destruction takes on a particular danger. We 
cannot help but note the increase in conventional arms in the 
region, which undoubtedly leads to increased militarization of 
the developing countries. The effort undertaken by P'yongyang to 
withdraw from the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
has evoked considerable concern in Russia and other states of 
the region. In connection with this, the nuclear missile 
ambitions of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] 
are also cause for concern. Alarming voices are also resounding 
from Tokyo to the effect that, in case of appearance of nuclear 
weapons in North Korea, the Tokyo leadership may opt for a 
review of its defense conceptions. 
  The list of challenges and dangers presented above, which 
are 
an object of concern for the Russian leadership, invariably 
includes also ecological security. 
  In order to withstand these challenges and threats together 
with the other states in the region, Russia is implementing a 
broad complex of measures, understanding very well that no one 
state, no matter how mighty it may be, can independently solve 
all the problems which arise here. 
  First of all, Russia's leadership proceeds from the fact 
that 
its armed forces in the Far East must serve as a guarantor of 
stability and security, and not pose a threat to other states. 
The Russian Federation is implementing this policy by means of 
significantly reducing the combat contingent of the Pacific 
Ocean fleet; by removing part of its nuclear missile submarines 
and strategic bombers from combat readiness; by totally 
liquidating the medium- and short-range missiles located in the 
Asian part of Russia (we might add that today not one strategic 
missile is aimed against any Asian state); by reducing its 
military presence in the southern islands of the Kuril Ridge, up 
to its total liquidation; by reducing the level of the military 
contingent stationed along the Russian-Chinese border, and by 
steadfastly meeting its obligations under the Treaty on 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as well as the obligation 
not to be the first to use these weapons. 
  The policy on ensuring security is being realized by Russia 
in the course of such measures as strengthening and modernizing 
conventional armed forces with subsequent reduction in their 
numbers on the basis of the concept of defensive adequacy; 
retaining the nuclear potential at the level provided by the 
START-2 treaty and other agreements; prolonging the moratorium 
on nuclear testing for one more year, if either of the parties 
does not renew them first, and maintaining stable and 
multi-lateral relations with other countries in the interests of 
cooperation and security in the region. A model for such 
positive cooperation may be the Russian-Chinese talks on 
demilitarization of the common boundary between the two 
countries, as well as the agreements between the RF and the USA 
on questions of security and disarmament. The security of Russia 
is also ensured by the implementation of a course toward 
political resolution of crisis situations in the regions. Russia 
has supported the position of the G-7 at the "summit" in Tokyo, 
which spoke out in favor of creating a negotiation mechanism of 
control over the political resolution of conflicts in Northeast 
Asia. 
  If we conduct a more detailed examination of Russia's 
strategy in Northeast Asia from the standpoint of ensuring 
security and stability, peace and prosperity of the entire 
Asia-Pacific region, first of all we must proceed from the fact 
that the Russian Federation, being a Eurasian state, expects to 
have comprehensive participation in all the regional structures 
formulated for the purpose of ensuring the above-mentioned tasks 
in the sub-region of Northeast Asia. Moreover, not in the role 
of a junior partner, as B. Zanegin maintains, but as a state 
having equal rights with the other members. We might add that 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in speaking of Russia's role in the 
Asia-Pacific region, called it a "great Pacific power." 
  In order to ensure its strategy in Northeast Asia, Russia 
needs international support of the transformations which it is 
implementing--moral, spiritual and ideological support. 
Moreover, Moscow is counting not so much on financial injections 
and humanitarian aid as on the regulation of large-scale 
business cooperation, and on the removal of all limitations on 
deliveries of high technologies, including from Japan. In 
speaking of the technological role of Japan within the framework 
of the region, a prominent Japanese political and social leader, 
the former prime minister of the Land of the Rising Sun, 
Yasuhiro Nakasone, in his work entitled "After the Cold War," 
emphasizes that his country will firmly establish itself on the 
world arena only after it regulates "the process of transferring 
technologies and adopting environmental protection measures." 
[3] Despite repeated announcements by USA President B. Clinton 
to the effect that he will eliminate the barriers in trade with 
Russia, the approaches by participants in the conference of the 
seven highly developed countries of the world [G-7] held in 
Tokyo in early July of 1993, as noted above, turned out to be in 
the spirit of the "cold war" in this regard. 
  Russia might have been able to make use of the experience of 
countries in which the processes similar to those which are 
currently noted in our country took place or are taking place: 
In Japan--in the 50's-60's, in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia--in the 
recent past and up to the present day. 
  Moscow would not only like to safeguard its borders, 
including also its Far Eastern borders, but would also like to 
exclude any outside intervention in its domestic affairs. 
  Russia is not interested in isolating its Asiatic part from 
the outside world, including also from the states of Northeast 
Asia. In compiling its plans for development of the Siberian and 
Far Eastern regions, Russia is counting on the participation of 
the Pacific Ocean countries, and primarily the states of the 
northeastern Pacific, in developing its eastern regions, in 
assimilating huge natural resources, and in creating the 
infrastructure necessary for incorporation of this part of 
Russia into the system of economic relations in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  We must stress once again that the entry of the RF into the 
world community presupposes also its equal, and not some 
indirect or secondary, participation in all the processes taking 
place in the Asia-Pacific region. Unfortunately, certain 
countries of this region, and primarily Japan, fearing 
competition and reduction in its level of influence, are in no 
way interested in Russia's presence here. 
  It seems that, aside from Russia, other CIS republics have 
also begun to show an interest in the Asia-Pacific region. Thus, 
for example, Kazakhstan President N. Nazarbayev, speaking at the 
47th session of the UN General Assembly in the Fall of 1992, 
announced: "The second aspect which I would like to deal with is 
the problem of peace and security on our continent--Asia, and 
even broader--Eurasia. We are speaking of the initiative by the 
Republic of Kazakhstan on holding a Conference on Interaction 
and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (SVMDA)". [4] According 
to Nazarbayev, this Assembly must be transformed into a 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Eurasia by the end of 
the 20th Century, and at the beginning of the 21st Century--it 
must prepare for the unification of continental systems of 
collective security for Asia, Europe, Africa and America into an 
integral world system of collective security and cooperation. 
However, the real state of affairs suggests that this idea is 
hardly realizable in the foreseeable future. Most likely it will 
soon be forgotten, as was the case with Brezhnev's idea of 
collective security in Asia and Gorbachev's idea of an Asiatic 
conference, since the conditions for formulating such a system 
have not yet been created. Many researchers have pointed this 
out. For example, as the Chinese scientist Van Guan writes in 
the journal LYAOVAN, despite the general stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region and in Eastern Asia, "many countries of the 
region, in the course of shifts in the world situation, are 
introducing corrections into their policy and plans, and deep 
changes are currently occurring in the relation and placement of 
forces in the region." Furthermore, Van concludes that "the 
tendency toward multi-polarity will continue to develop in the 
Asia-Pacific region." [5] 
  In turn, the very leadership of the largest Asian power--the 
People's Republic of China, believes that the occurrence of a 
new world war is unlikely in the near future. However, the 
military threat has not yet been entirely eliminated. Among the 
factors threatening the security of China, the country's 
leadership cites primarily the Taiwan problem; the lack of 
resolution to questions of the "disputed" areas along the state 
boundaries, primarily with India; the conflicts over the 
affiliation of a number of islands in the South China and East 
China Seas; the problem of the continental shelf in the marine 
areas bordering South Korea and Japan, and the possibility of 
intervention by neighboring states into China's domestic affairs 
(for example, the direct support of Tibet separatists by India). 
A large part of these problems relates to the sphere of 
territorial disputes, has deep historical roots and bears a 
long-term character. China is striving toward ever more active 
participation in the resolution of global and regional problems 
associated with international security. The country's leadership 
believes that this task corresponds to the greatest degree with 
such aspects of PRC [People's Republic of China] policy as 
non-participation in any military blocks and alliances, absence 
of military bases on the territories of other states, the 
obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to 
use them against non-nuclear zones and states which do not have 
nuclear weapons on their territories, as well as the 
unconditional prohibition of chemical and other types of weapons 
of mass destruction. An important place in the plan for ensuring 
regional security belongs to China's growing initiative in the 
course toward resurrecting good neighborly relations with all 
the states adjoining it, and with the ASEAN [Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations] states and other states of the region, 
including those entering into military-political alliances. 
  Based on the principles of "self-determination and 
independence" of foreign policy, as well as its continually 
growing economic potential (the PRC today retains the highest 
economic growth in the world--up to 12 percent per year), Peking 
is for the present rejecting the idea of collective regional 
security. 
  China is undertaking the modernization of its naval fleet. 
This is quite natural for a sovereign state which up until now 
has practically not had an ocean fleet. At the same time, this 
evokes apprehension among its neighboring Asiatic states. By the 
mid-90's, China will have the capability of "placing in the open 
sea naval forces consisting of many ships, supported by 
long-range bombers equipped with anti-ship missiles." [6] The 
neighbors are also apprehensive about China's expanding sale of 
ship-launched anti-ship missiles (to Thailand in 1990). [7] 
  There is an increasingly real possibility of China's 
becoming 
a large regional force which may significantly influence the 
situation not only in the region of Northeast Asia, but also on 
a global scale. 
  The efforts of the DPRK to withdraw from the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and P'yongyang's nuclear 
missile ambitions have seriously complicated the problems of 
security in Asia. The prevalent opinion in the Russian mass 
media is that the principles of collective security in Northeast 
Asia which had begun to be laid down have turned out to be 
significantly undermined. The demarche by North Korea, as 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA affirms, has thrust Asia into unprecedented 
instability and strategic indeterminacy. [8] In connection with 
this, the supposition was expressed that the idea of realization 
of collective security in Asia seems improbable at the present 
time. Although these evaluations should be viewed as extreme, 
nevertheless this demarche by P'yongyang, undoubtedly, has 
significantly hindered political regulation on the Korean 
penninsula. 
  As for the USA, American scientists, and specifically James 
Goodby, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, believe that 
a stable regional system in the Asia-Pacific region which 
includes the USA, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the DPRK 
and Russia may be based on four primary leading organizational 
principles: Hegemony, balance of forces, collective security and 
consensus (agreement). [9] According to Goodby, the current 
system does not correspond to any of the listed principles. Not 
one of the countries has the appropriate potential, and 
consequently cannot aspire to the role of the predominant 
hegemonic power in the region. Japan, aside from its economic 
might, has no other levers for manifesting hegemonic ambitions. 
The military-economic might of the USA as an attribute of a 
superpower has not grown into a hegemonic power in the region. 
China and Russia, which are involved in their own domestic 
affairs, do not aspire to hegemony, while the other powers, with 
all their potentials taken together, cannot act in this role. 
This opinion expressed by the leading American researcher is 
evidently close to the truth. In any case, many scientists from 
the countries of Northeast Asia believe that the USA, which has 
spoken out quite sharply on the results of formation of the 
European Community, is dubious about the idea of creating 
economic and political associations in the region of Northeast 
Asia, and has not defined a clear-cut attitude toward regional 
associations in the Asia-Pacific region. It is quite satisfied 
with the structure of security based on bilateral agreements 
which has existed up until the present time, and which should be 
only slightly modified under the current conditions. At the same 
time, it remains unclear what roles the USA ascribes to Russia 
and China. 
  The government of Japan supports the position of the USA in 
the preservation and partial modification of the American system 
of security based on bilateral agreements which has existed up 
until the present time. At the same time, in the opinion of the 
Japanese academic world, there has long been a need for a 
regional alliance for the collective provision of security, as 
well as for regional treaty relations. 
  In the case of creating a regional alliance for the 
collective provision of security, it is necessary, as the 
Japanese researchers believe, to first of all consider the 
measures for developing relations of true cooperation, or at 
least mutual understanding. Without this, a recognition of the 
danger of opposition of military blocks cannot be achieved. 
Speaking more specifically, contrary to the logic of the power 
politics which has existed up until the present time, individual 
influential states from neighboring alliances have ensured 
effective co-existence between each other. Perhaps we should 
think first of an "alliance capable of making serious 
decisions." [10] Moreover, it would be desirable to develop 
organizational decisions at a certain level between various 
alliances which are not neighbors (for example, a discussion of 
global problems of disarmament). Such a structure could be 
called the "Asiatic house," which would resolve the 
above-mentioned problems, as Japanese researchers believe. [11] 
  Many analysts concur in the opinion that regional alliances 
which do not include influential countries may perhaps exist at 
the will of small groups which have the power of veto. However, 
they cannot ensure security in the region with sufficient 
effectiveness. Perhaps ASEAN belongs to this type of alliance, 
as it enjoys the patronage of American military might (through 
the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore), which is one of the 
reasons for its success. ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Forum (APEF) have perhaps the greatest chances of becoming the 
centers of future regional structures in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Among the successfully functioning institutions of ASEAN are 
the expanded conferences of foreign affairs ministers which are 
growing in scope. These operate according to the formula "6 + 5 
+ X," where 6 is the ASEAN "six" (Singapore, Philippines, 
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei), 5 is the Pacific 
"five" (USA, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), and X is 
the EC [European Community], the Republic of Korea, as well as 
possible other future members of the community. The inclusion of 
Russia and China in this forum, not as guests but as 
participants, is yet to come. In July 1992 and August 1993, the 
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs (along with his Chinese, 
Vietnamese and Laotian colleagues) took part in the work of the 
expanded Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the ASEAN 
Countries for the first time in the Soviet and post-Soviet 
period. As their membership increases in the future, the 
expanded conferences of foreign affairs ministers of the ASEAN 
member states present an almost ready-made structure for 
regional interaction in the Asia-Pacific region, capable of 
becoming the basis for formulation of collective security in 
Northeast Asia. 
  A unique model for the East-Asiatic order was proposed by 
Professor Yan Sun Chul of Seoul National University. [12] He 
called it a model of the "flying kite," or the eastern Asiatic 
regime of collective peace and prosperity. In the center of such 
a paper kite is the Korean penninsula with the two states 
located on it: The DKRP and the Republic of Korea, and on the 
four corners are the CIS (Russia), Japan, China and the USA. In 
the future it is presumed that, after unification, the central 
role will be occupied by a unified Korea. For the present time, 
the central functions could be assumed by the Republic of Korea. 
  The Korean scientist explains why specifically the Republic 
of Korea must occupy the central unifying role, citing the 
following factors: 
  First of all, the central organ of the region should not 
have 
an aggressive potential or present any threat in regard to other 
states which form the structure of the model. On this parameter, 
Seoul corresponds to the stipulated conditions; 
  Secondly, the central leadership should not be in conflict 
with the other four states. South Korea corresponds to these 
requirements. The other states, at various times in the past and 
the present, have been in conflicting relations with each other; 
  Thirdly, the Republic of Korea may act as a force of 
arbitration not only on problems of security, but also in the 
economic sphere. The country's dynamically developing economy 
allows it to fulfill this function. 
  However, the model of the "flying kite" is hypothetically 
possible only if the world does not follow the path of 
development of power politics and its concentration in the hands 
of the great powers, if regional order is built on such general 
values as democracy, protection of human rights, and respect for 
international laws, as well as such institutions as the UN. 
Although this model has received the positive reviews of 
opponents, at the present time it appears utopian. 
  A brief analysis of Russia's national interests and its 
approach to the problem of ensuring security in Northeast Asia 
shows that, in developing the foreign policy conception in 
Northeast Asia, the Russian leadership proceeded from the 
assumptions that after the loss of a number of Black Sea and 
Baltic ports and harbors, the Far East becomes the main outpost 
and maritime gateway of the RF to Asia. A review of the 
positions of the primary states in the region on the question of 
formulating a body capable of acting as a coordinating center 
which could unify the coinciding interests of all states of 
Northeast Asia and direct them toward the provision of 
stability, peace and prosperity testifies to the multiplicity of 
approaches. It demonstrates the fact that this process will 
follow a rather lengthy and complicated course, and that it has 
its own specifics which differ strikingly from the process of 
the CSCE, although certain European measures may be superimposed 
onto the general picture of formation of the negotiations 
mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region as a whole and specifically 
in the subregion of Northeast Asia.

  [Text] The president of the Russian Federation and the 
prime minister of Japan, guided by an understanding that as a 
result of the end of the cold war the world is moving away from 
a structure of confrontation to cooperation, affording new 
prospects of the development of international interaction at the 
global and regional level and in bilateral relations between 
states, which is creating favorable prerequisites for a full 
normalization of Russian-Japanese bilateral relations; 
  proclaiming that the Russian Federation and Japan share the 
universal values of freedom, democracy, supremacy of the law, 
and respect for basic human rights; 
  remembering that support for the market economy and free 
trade contributes to the burgeoning of the economy of both 
countries and the healthy development of the world economy as a 
whole; 
  being sure that the success of the reforms implemented in 
the 
Russian Federation will be of decisive significance for the 
building of a new world political and economic order; 
  confirming the importance of the building of bilateral 
relations on the basis of respect for the purposes and 
principles of the UN Charter; 
  being convinced that the Russian Federation and Japan must 
overcome the legacy of totalitarianism and interact with one 
another in the spirit of international cooperation for the 
building of a new international order and the full normalization 
of bilateral relations, declare as hereunder: 
  1. The president of the Russian Federation and the prime 
minister of Japan are at one in their understanding that the 
democratic transformations and economic reform being undertaken 
in Russia are of extraordinary importance not only for the 
peoples of this country but also for the world as a whole and 
that the success of Russia's transition to a genuinely market 
economy and the smooth integration of the Russian Federation in 
the world democratic community are, what is more, in the sides' 
opinion, an inalienable factor of a strengthening of 
international stability and the irreversibility of the process 
of the formation of a new world order. 
  In this connection the prime minister of Japan conveyed to 
the president of the Russian Federation the following message of 
the leaders of the Seven. 
  "We regret that as a result of the armed clashes in Moscow 
provoked by supporters of the former parliament, there were 
numerous human casualties, but at the same time we welcome the 
fact that the situation is returning to normal and that legality 
and order, including respect for human rights, are being 
restored. 
  "We confirm once again that support for the policy of 
democratic and economic reforms pursued by President B.N. 
Yeltsin remains invariable and express great hope that as a 
result of elections to a new parliament, free and fair and with 
broad public participation, a genuinely democratic society which 
reflects the will of the people will be born and that the 
reforms will be continued." 
  2. Of a common opinion on the need to surmount in bilateral 
relations the grim legacy of the past, the president of the 
Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan conducted 
serious negotiations on the question of the ownership of the 
islands of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai. The parties 
agree that it is necessary to continue the negotiations for the 
speediest conclusion of a peace treaty by way of a solution of 
the said question, proceeding from historical and legal facts 
and on the basis of documents formulated in accordance with an 
agreement between the two countries and also the principles of 
legality and justice, and in this way to fully normalize 
bilateral relations. In this connection the Government of the 
Russian Federation and the Government of Japan confirm that the 
Russian Federation is the state-continuer of the USSR and that 
all treaties and other international accords between the Soviet 
Union and Japan continue to apply in relations between the 
Russian Federation and Japan. 
  The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government 
of Japan note also that there has thus far been a constructive 
dialogue within the framework of the working group on a peace 
treaty between the two countries and that a result thereof was 
the joint publication by the Russian and Japanese sides in 
September 1992 of the "Joint Digest of Documents on the History 
of the Territorial Demarcation Between Russia and Japan." 
  The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government 
of Japan agree to take a number of steps for a deepening of 
mutual understanding, primarily in the plane of a further 
improvement in reciprocal trips of the permanent residents of 
the above-mentioned islands and inhabitants of Japan made within 
the framework of the procedure established on the basis of an 
agreement between the two parties. 
  3. Certain that a broadening of the political dialogue is a 
useful and efficient means of the development of 
Russian-Japanese relations, the president of the Russian 
Federation and the prime minister of Japan agree to continue, 
intensify, and develop political dialogue by way of regular 
reciprocal visits at top leader and foreign minister and also 
deputy foreign minister level. 
  4. Welcoming the results achieved thus far in the sphere of 
arms control and disarmament, and confirming the need for their 
conscientious fulfillment, the president of the Russian 
Federation and the prime minister of Japan are united in their 
understanding of the importance of the further advancement of 
this process and of its being made irreversible. 
  Having a common understanding of the importance for security 
throughout the world of the question of the dismantling of 
nuclear weapons and of the problem of the storage of the nuclear 
materials and control over them and their processing which 
arises in this connection, the parties confirm their desire to 
cooperate in the said fields. Confirming also that the discharge 
of radioactive waste into the sea is causing serious concern 
globally, particularly from the viewpoint of its effect on the 
environment in adjacent states, the parties agree for further 
consideration of this problem to hold close consultations along 
the lines of the joint Russian-Japanese working group. 
  The parties welcome the signing in January 1993 in Paris of 
the Convention Banning Chemical Weapons and express the hope 
that as many states as possible will subscribe to this 
convention and that it will contribute to peace and stability 
worldwide. The parties agree also to cooperate closely with each 
other for the effective nonproliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and their delivery systems and also the material, 
equipment, technology, and knowhow associated with them and to 
enhance the transparency of conventional arms supplies. 
  5. The president of the Russian Federation and the prime 
minister of Japan are of a common opinion concerning 
possibilities for dynamic development that could be demonstrated 
by the Asia-Pacific region in the world of the 21st century on 
the basis of the common principles of freedom and openness. The 
parties confirm the significance of the fact that the Russian 
Federation will by way of the implementation of the principles 
of legality and justice become an active and constructive 
partner in this region and will make a further contribution to 
the development of political and economic relations between the 
states located therein and are also agreed that considerable 
importance for the accomplishment of this task is attached to 
the full normalization of relations between the Russian 
Federation and Japan, which perform an important role in this 
region, in the sense that it would make it possible to make this 
region a zone of peace and stability and also an area of the 
development of economic cooperation based on a system of free 
trade open to all countries and regions, the Russian Federation 
included. 
  Proceeding from a common understanding of the need for a 
strengthening of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, 
the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister 
of Japan confirm the importance of dialogue between government 
bodies of two countries on a wide range of issues, including 
aspects of security, and agree to continue to stimulate such 
exchanges of opinion. 
  6. Taking account of the debate under way at the United 
Nations, including that on the issue of what the organization's 
functions and structure should be in order that it might, 
adapting to the changing international situation, perform a 
central role in maintaining and creating peace throughout the 
world, the president of the Russian Federation and prime 
minister of Japan agree to step up the contribution of both 
countries to the efforts of the United Nations aimed at a 
settlement of global and regional problems and thereby to make 
joint efforts for the further enhancement of the authority of 
the organization.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Nevzorov by V. Shurygin and comments by </F>
A. Lukyanov and V. Starodubtsev: "`Our People' in the Duma"] 
  [Text] The patriots Nevzorov, Vlasov, Ilyukhin, 
Tuleyev, Sevastyanov, Baburin, Isakov, Lemeshev, Romanov, 
Zyuganov, Starodubtsev, Lukyanov, Govorukhin, and many more 
besides who are prepared to defend the interests of the 
motherland at the price of their lives have, according to the 
election results, been designated deputies of the State 
Duma. 
<H5>  Aleksandr Nevzorov: `It Is My Duty To Continue the Struggle' </H5>
  [Shurygin] Glebych, our wholehearted congratulations on your 
victory! You are now a deputy, a politician. What does this 
victory mean to you? How do you view your seat in the new 
parliament? Who are you in politics? 
  [Nevzorov] Well, first of all I am not a "politician" in the 
form in which society has become accustomed to seeing him. I am 
a journalist, I am a soldier. Primarily a professional of my 
occupation. And I intend, accordingly, to concern myself 
primarily with my field--television commentary. This is the 
arena of struggle for me as a politician. I will fight to ensure 
that the television screen cease being a Tampax and Snickers 
spokesman for lies and begin to tell people the truth about the 
entire depth of the tragedy and crisis in which society has 
found itself. About its heroes and criminals. For me the mandate 
of deputy is a mandate for hard labor, and I perceive it only as 
such. 
  [Shurygin] How was it that you all of sudden left the 
television camera and moved into the role of legitimate 
politician? 
  [Nevzorov] A national tragedy had occurred before our eyes. 
The regime in the person of Yeltsin organized the mass killing 
of our compatriots. My friends were in the shot-up parliament. 
Many of them were wounded, several gave their lives. It is a 
matter of honor for me as a man and as a comrade in arms to 
carry their struggle against the regime. I entered politics as 
reinforcements enter the trenches after fierce fighting. And I 
will struggle relentlessly against the killers, looters, and 
other scum "resting on the laurels" of the October shooting. Let 
them be in no doubt about this. 
  [Shurygin] What sort of elections were these for you? How 
were they conducted? What did you find surprising? 
  [Nevzorov] I specially let my name go forward for the 
central 
constituency of St. Petersburg, a constituency considered a 
bastion of "democracy." The most affluent Petersburgers live 
there. It is an area of offices, fashionable supermarkets, and 
privatized apartments. And this was my personal challenge to the 
Democratic Russia riff-raff, who had nominated a whole cohort of 
their candidates. My victory going away--this is my triumph, my 
first blow at the murderers, corrupters, and thieves covered by 
the mask of "democrats." 
  I simply proved that, despite the name Nevzorov, which 
"liberals" shun like the plague, there are, for all that, still 
more of "our people" in society. They are more confident, 
stronger, and more active than the "dems." They were "doomed" to 
victory! 
  These elections were more honest and objective than the 
previous ones. Having put the "opposition" under a time 
constraint with the election campaign, the regime itself found 
itself under an organizational time constraint, that is, in 
terms of the organization and coordination of these elections. 
  [Shurygin] Your plans for the immediate future? 
  [Nevzorov] First of all, to restore "Sekundy." This is not 
my 
initiative. It is an ultimatum from the electorate. People are 
demanding, people are expecting "Sekundy." I intend fighting for 
the restoration on LenTV of an atmosphere of real creativity, 
not political fawning and the pornography that is flourishing 
here today. 
  [Shurygin] Whose side are you on, Glebych? Who is covering 
your rear, who lines up with you? 
  [Nevzorov] All "our people." My loyal brother Lukyanov, 
Starodubtsev, Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and, of course, the 
brilliant Aleksandr Prokhanov and his ZAVTRA. I declare, 
incidentally, that in accordance with a deputy's right to 
monitor the news media, I, on my own initiative, appoint myself 
a member of the editorial board of the newspaper ZAVTRA and all 
subsequent ones. 
  Greetings to all! 
<H5>  Anatoliy Lukyanov: `The DEN Offensive Is Under Way!' </H5>
  I believe that the present elections were not by nature 
either democratic or free. I had great doubts before agreeing to 
the suggestions that I take part in the elections, but these 
were outweighed by the realization that had we shunned these 
elections, we would have deprived ourselves of an opportunity to 
represent the people's interests not only in the Duma but in 
local government also. 
  I was nominated by the Smolensk Public Assembly. It unites 
nonparty people and Communists, people of different 
nationalities, veterans, and the youth. It is a broad 
organization performing a great deal of patriotic work. 
  Within a week they had more than twice as many signatures as 
were needed, and I was registered as a candidate for deputy. I 
drove to practically all districts of Smolensk Oblast. There 
were approximately 10,000 persons at the meetings. The mood in 
the Smolensk region is diametrically opposite to what it is in 
Moscow. 
  Even in the rural areas, for example, Yeltsin's edict on the 
sale of land prompted people to vote against the Constitution 
and against the candidates of the Russia's Choice bloc. The 
election results are as follows: I obtained 102,000 votes and 
was 50,000 votes ahead of my rivals. 
  The Communists gained second place in Smolensk Oblast as a 
whole, Zhirinovskiy coming first. The Constitution was not 
supported by the electorate in Smolensk Oblast. It was voted 
down by 55 percent of the electorate. This was the general mood, 
what is more--both in the city and in rural localities. Very 
harsh words were leveled at this Constitution because it was 
seen how the individual's existing rights are being abridged, 
and there was a very keen awareness of the movement toward 
presidential dictatorship. 
  Speaking of the election results, it seems to me that all 
this is logical. People voted not so much for Zhirinovskiy as 
against the regime that is being installed in Russia. My views 
do not coincide with what Zhirinovskiy says, but this party 
expresses the interests of those who keenly sense how 
methodically the Russian Empire is being demolished and how an 
offensive against the Russian people, against Russian interests, 
is under way. Protest in society had matured, and it produced 
these results. 
  The patriotic movement was not represented at the elections. 
I believe that, first, everything was done to limit the 
participation of the patriotic forces in the elections with the 
consent of the authorities and in accordance with their wishes. 
The disappearance from the slates of the bloc of Baburin and 
other patriotic forces was no accident. With their own hands the 
so-called democrats cleared the way for Zhirinovskiy. The 
democrats were delighted that Zhirinovskiy, participating in the 
constitutional assembly, supported the Constitution and strong 
presidential power and, when speaking, distanced himself from 
the Communists. 
  I have spoken about where we part company with Zhirinovskiy, 
but the "Demchoice" representative gave him a positive mark. The 
"Choicers" calculated that on the main points he would support 
both the president and the democrats. They struck, therefore, at 
the main opponents--the patriots and Communists. It all turned 
out differently. And now they have sensed that the Constitution 
could work for Zhirinovskiy also. This is why he has come in for 
such a beating in the press. 
  As far as the Constitution is concerned, I, as a lawyer, can 
say with confidence that it has been adopted in defiance of the 
referendum statutes. Only one-third of the electorate voted for 
the Constitution. One-third of society cannot impose its will on 
two-thirds. 
  It seems to me that the first thing that the opposition 
forces in the Duma should do is to return once more to the 
question of the Constitution. From my viewpoint, a "pocket duma" 
has not resulted. This Duma will be torn by contradictions, and 
much will depend on the intelligent, serious formulation of 
issues by all blocs. Not counting the centrists, the forces in 
the Duma are divided evenly in two. This is a transitional 
parliament, which should prepare the ground for real elections. 
If this Duma does prepare this ground and adopts the requisite 
laws, it will have accomplished its mission. 
  I dream that one further faction will emerge from among the 
independent and single-seat deputies: a patriotic bloc. 
According to my calculations, this means about 20 deputies 
expressing primarily patriotic views. This faction could, first, 
help very considerably the cohesion of healthy forces in the 
Duma and, second, bring order to bear in the ranks of the 
centrists. This is a serious idea, it needs to be worked on 
thoroughly. Yuriy Vlasov, say: With whom will he affiliate? Or 
Sergey Baburin, Nevzorov? Such a patriotic faction could help 
the work of the Duma very considerably. Newspapers of a 
patriotic focus could be the particular spokesman for the 
patriotic bloc. Many newspapers, including your DEN, are banned 
at this time. You are being published in all cities of 
Russia--from Krasnoyarsk to Lipetsk--and even overseas, this is 
not the issue. All publications need to be restored. 
  I believe that one of the first inquiries of the new Duma 
will be one concerning the press. It will be raised by many 
factions. All the outrages perpetrated by the authorities in 
respect to the press--PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, DEN, 
GLASNOST--were connected with preventing the opposition press 
operating before the elections. When I was asked about the 
newspaper DEN, I told the electorate that you could ban the 
newspaper DEN, but THE DEN OFFENSIVE COULD NOT BE BANNED. DEN 
will come, it will unfailingly come, and even if it is today 
called ZAVTRA, it will, nonetheless, be that same DEN. 
  A ban on newspapers is a ban on free thought, it is a fear 
of 
the opposition. If there is something to set against it, do so. 
Fulminating against the so-called "red-browns," the "democrats" 
will soon have nothing against which to plead. It would be 
boring without DEN! 
  I myself need to figure out my future actions in the Duma. 
There have been many calls and reports in the foreign press 
about my alleged nomination for the position of speaker of the 
Duma. The best speaker in Europe in 1991 could, it is said, pass 
on his entire experience to the young Duma. I treat these rumors 
with composure and warily even. We need first to decide the 
question of the powers of deputies of the Duma, mine included, 
and only then decide the question of leadership of the house. 
  I do not envy the speaker of our Duma from any party, the 
Communist Party included. It will be necessary for him, and this 
would be particularly difficult for me, to be in contact with 
the people who have unlawfully been oppressing everyone. It 
will, after all, be necessary to shake the president's hand. How 
could I do this? An Italian newspaper has already decided 
everything for us, appointed and elected everyone. Although I 
could, of course, teach many people about organization of the 
business of the Duma, work with the opposition, and the patience 
that a speaker should possess. 
  What would I submit to the first session of the Duma? My 
first wish would be for a cardinal change in government policy. 
The formation of a government which can serve the interests of 
the whole people and cancel the "shock therapy." 
<H5>  Vasiliy Starodubtsev: `They Can Be Moved, Apparently...' </H5>
  I considered these elections illegal, but entered the fray 
with the desire to have at least this platform because I could 
not remain silent. I did not expect that the defeat of Russia's 
Choice and the other democratic blocs would be so devastating. 
They can be moved, apparently. You just have to vote against 
them. 
  Ten percent of Russians voted for the Agrarian Party. We 
could have amassed 20 percent had the election campaign been 
better organized. I myself was elected to the Federation Council 
for the 71st Two-Seat District at home, in Tver Oblast, since I 
could not leave the farm for permanent work in the State Duma. 
But I will, I believe, be an active participant in the affairs 
of our faction in the State Duma also. Our coalition with the 
Communists is the most pressing. We will extend a hand to all 
factions that agree with our two priorities: the first, halting 
the decline in production and averting the closure of factories 
and plants at any price; the second, saving the agrarian 
complex, saving the countryside: without this Russia will die 
from starvation, reforms indeed! 
  As far as the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction is 
concerned, it will, I believe, prove heterogeneous and 
amorphous. Whatever the attempts to embroil it with the 
Communists or with us, there will, I am sure, be people there 
nonetheless who sincerely ache for Russia, not for the sake of 
political buffoonery. I am inclined to believe about 
Zhirinovskiy himself that he is a Trojan Horse inserted in the 
Kremlin to be the trump card in the hidden struggle of Kremlin 
political clans. His promises are buttressed by nothing, his 
populism is dangerous, and his foreign policy ambitions are 
provocative. The final results have not yet been tallied, for 
that matter, and we do not yet know who will get how many seats.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zhukov: "The Failures Seek a New Niche"] </F>
  [Text] While the factions of eight political parties 
and coalitions sit in the State Duma, their luckless 
competitors, who failed at the elections, are feverishly 
attempting to acquire a new character and restore their 
morale. 
  The parties that have support in the "towns and villages" 
have assembled their congresses. Of the democrats, Konstantin 
Borovoy (Party of Economic Freedom) (PEF) operated the most 
promptly, and he was followed by Gavriil Popov, who conducted 
the Second Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms (RMDR) 
Congress. 
  It is interesting that the PEF congress was for the first 
time held behind closed doors. Party activists were clearly 
reluctant to present for general review the profound mutual 
discontent. The Yekaterinburg delegation accused the party 
leadership of having made a hash of the elections. This position 
was supported by PEF Cochairman Irina Khakamada in addition to 
rank-and-file delegates from the localities. She hinted that her 
party membership would depend on whether the PEF could work with 
the regions or would confine itself to the "individual political 
statements" of its leader. Yielding to the pressure of the 
obdurate regionals, the congress inserted in the leadership 
three cochairmen from the provinces. Konstantin Borovoy, despite 
the "intrigues," remains leader of the party and he called on 
his comrades for "strict opposition to the policy of the 
president and the government." The party hopes to rehabilitate 
itself as quickly as possible for the 12 December defeat by 
active participation in the local elections. 
  The burden of the report of Gavriil Popov at the Second RMDR 
Congress amounted to the proposition that the Western idea of 
reforms in Russia had been defeated and that now "those who have 
made a mess of the reforms are being removed." Disagreements 
emerged over the assessment of the situation in the movement. 
Sergey Krasavchenko dissociated himself from the leader of the 
RMDR and declined to run for the Political Council. 
  Popov formulated the reasons for the failure at the 
elections 
briefly: the RMDR had been too gentle in its criticism of the 
government and had failed to put forward its alternative, local 
structures had not been formed, too much time had been spent 
looking for allies, the propaganda campaign was insipid.... 
  Judging by everything, the strategic miscalculations of the 
movement are connected with the protracted search for political 
self-identification. The RMDR simply cannot find its niche (or 
does it just not have one?). Were the government to be 
criticized harshly, how would the RMDR differ from "Yabloko" or 
the Democratic Party of Russia? If the pro-West course of the 
reforms does not suit the movement, why does it not form a bloc 
with the moderate patriots? 
  Simply having failed to find for itself a place in the 
political spectrum, the congress decided "to strengthen 
party-mindedness" and expand the social base of the RMDR. In 
addition, the movement opposed early parliamentary and 
presidential elections and advocated a three- or fourth-month 
postponement of the local elections. The RMDR is proposing this 
timeout, probably, because it is well aware that it is not ready 
for the struggle for seats. 
  The Russian Union of Youth (RUY), a founder of the Russia's 
Future-New Names election bloc, has also discussed its problems 
at a congress. The young people's thoughts on the election 
failure were, obviously, so bitter that as a result they decided 
to engage mainly not in political but cultural-educational 
activity. The reasoning is simple: The youth are apolitical, and 
the RUY has not found its niche. 
  Against the background of the certain revitalization 
mimicked 
by the nonparliamentary parties of a democratic persuasion, the 
patriots have been totally inconspicuous. After not one 
patriotic party had made it to the second lap of the election 
marathon, they receded for a long time into the background. 
  Why was this? As a rule, the leaders of the patriotic 
opposition attribute their failure to the unfair authorities. 
Mikhail Astafyev, chairman of the Constitutional Democratic 
Party (CDP-PPF): "We collected 103,000 signatures, but we were 
debarred from the elections. We consider this step purely 
political, and its purpose, to clear the way for Zhirinovskiy." 
  The patriots are themselves even embarrassed to acknowledge 
that they lost not so much to the authorities as to the LDPR and 
that Zhirinovskiy took away their electorate and put them on the 
sidelines. The traditional national-patriotic ideology appealing 
to the deep past proved less attractive than Zhirinovskiy's 
rhetoric addressed to the "glorious future." The doctrine has to 
be changed, of course, but in this case a modernized 
national-patriotic ideology could be a second edition of the 
LDPR program. This despite the fact that no patriot can rival 
Zhirinovskiy in a personal capacity. 
  And these parties' "living space" is diminishing also. 
Sergey 
Baburin, for example, "has the impression that the government 
and the president are joining the patriotic movement." In his 
opinion, what the patriots have achieved over the course of two 
or three years is now recognized "even by Kozyrev." 
  Virtually the sole patriotic organization that has retained 
its niche is the Congress of Russian Communities (CRC). No one, 
apart from it, bothers seriously with Russians from the near 
abroad, and the CRC has no rivals, therefore. In an interview 
with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, Dmitriy Rogozin, the leader of this 
organization, declared: "The Second Congress of Russian 
Communities, which was held recently, showed that we are the 
sole mass organization which is developing rapidly. We are now 
working on separating out from the Congress an organization with 
purely political functions and uniting in it under the 
provisional name of Union of the Fatherland both 
patriot-fundamentalists and some democrats. And on the Congress 
retaining the function of a public ministry for the affairs of 
the Russian-speaking population in the near abroad." 
  The Russian National Union (RNU) of Sergey Baburin is 
preparing a congress. It is contemplated introducing individual 
membership (it is not clear as yet how many members the RNU 
has), enhancing intra-Union discipline, and, generally, talking 
about what comes next. 
  The activity of the RNU is today objectively receding into 
the background--for its leader, at least. The organization's 
main strategic mission, virtually, is the creation for the 
leader of a trampoline for a jump "into power." Baburin has 
"jumped" into the State Duma, and it is now important for him to 
assimilate this platform. He has formed the Russian Way group of 
deputies. It has just 17 members as yet, but Baburin is an 
optimist: "The Russia faction in the last parliament was formed 
over several months. I believe that our ranks will increase on 
this occasion also." 
  The plans of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement 
(RCDM) 
are, as its leader, Viktor Aksyuchits, declared, "to unite and 
fight." Deprived of its headquarters, the movement has drifted 
apart into its separate quarters. Aksyuchits has complained that 
his own apartment is reminiscent of a party archives, and he 
does not have room to turn around. "How can a party lacking 
official channels of financing exist," the leader of the RCDM 
laments. According to him, the banks have been ordered, on pain 
of punitive measures, to freeze all accounts of patriotic 
organizations. 
  The Constitutional Democrats (KDP-PPF) have split yet again. 
And although the split has not been recognized officially, no 
one is any longer in any doubt about it. At the recent KDP-PPF 
conference representatives of 11 regions (approximately half the 
party's active organizations) deemed the recent December party 
congress invalid and decided to hold it anew in March. 
  The splitters are reproaching party leader Mikhail Astafyev 
with "left-extremist sentiments" and "nonparliamentary forms of 
work in the Supreme Soviet," which, in their opinion, caused a 
drift of supporters away from the party. In addition, Astafyev 
has been guilty of a "violation of intra-party democracy." The 
Kadets will in March, most likely, split into right and left--it 
could well be down the middle. 
  Suspecting that they will not survive on their own, the 
patriots from time to time make attempts to unite. Without thus 
far the aid of the Communists, nothing has come of this. But the 
attempts have not been abandoned, and a new coalition began to 
be put together at the end of December. Its working name is the 
Movement of Civil and Patriotic Forces, the sponsors of the 
alliance including Viktor Aksyuchits, Oleg Rumyantsev, Aleksandr 
Tsipko, and Andrey Golovin. What brought together the RCDM and 
the social democrats and Astafyev's Kadets and the centrists who 
associated with the Civic Union? Only the severe shock following 
the election defeat, obviously. 
  But as soon as the shock passed, the plan for unification 
began to crumble. Aksyuchits is now obsessed with the idea of 
resuscitating the Russian National Assembly, which was formed a 
year ago and which departed this life almost immediately. The 
patriots to the left of the RCDP and the Kadets (Rumyantsev, 
Tsipko, and others) intend to build an autonomous formation--a 
National Alliance. True, both give assurances that a union 
between them is still possible. The rest of the information is 
being kept most strictly secret. Insofar as it is hard to 
reproach the leaders of the future organizations with a dislike 
of publicity, it may be assumed that there is as yet nothing 
about which to speak in more detail. The contemplated 
association lacks not only an organizational basis but a 
theoretical base also. 
  This is yet further testimony that the failures of the first 
multiparty elections were defeated for objective reasons. Some 
of them will attempt to restructure their organizations and 
modernize their programs, perhaps. But for many their best years 
are already behind them, and they will, most likely, depart the 
political arena without having found their electorate.

<F P=106> ["Statement of Leaders of Parties and Nongovernment </F>
Associations on the Illegitimacy of the Constitution Put to the 
Referendum by B. Yeltsin"] 
  [Text] The text of the Constitution put to the referendum 
on 12 December 1993 revives the authoritarian system in the 
Russian Federation. Granting the president dictatorial powers, 
the Constitution leaves Russia defenseless in the face of the 
ill will or caprice of both its present and future rulers. 
  The most flagrant violations of the 1978 Constitution (Basic 
Law) of the Russian Federation (with subsequent revisions) and 
the 1990 Referendum Act were perpetrated at the time of the 
referendum on the draft Constitution. 
  According to the 1978 Constitution, a referendum may be held 
only in the procedure established by the Constitution and laws 
of the Russian Federation (Article 5). The referendum on 
adoption of the Constitution of 12 December 1993 was conducted 
in the manner established by a subordinate edict of an official. 
  According to the Russian Federation Referendum Act, it is 
essential for the adoption of a constitution or revisions to the 
Constitution to obtain a majority vote of the total electorate. 
The Constitution was "approved" by the votes of less than 
one-third of those eligible to vote. 
  Serious violations were perpetrated also in the organization 
of the referendum itself. 
  The election commissions formed by the executive, which 
substituted for the legitimately elected authorities, spoke in 
support of the Constitution and thereby called into question the 
objectivity of the vote count. 
  In consideration of what has been said, we declare that: 
  The Constitution of 12 December 1993 cannot be deemed 
legitimate or valid. 
  The Federal Assembly elected on the basis of Edict No. 1400 
is operative, as specified by the president, until the adoption 
of a new Constitution of Russia. 
  The Constitution should be elaborated and adopted by a 
constituent assembly, a law on the elections for which should be 
adopted by the Federal Assembly. 
  We see this as the sole possible way to the building of a 
genuinely democratic and just constitutional system.

<F P=106> [Roundup of deputies' comments, compiled by Oleg Zhirnov: </F>
"Comrade Rybkin, Speaker and Man"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has elected as its chairman 
Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, candidate of the Agrarian Party of Russia 
faction. The 47-year-old politician is a native of Volgograd and 
is a graduate of the Volgograd Agricultural Institute and a 
candidate of technical sciences. He was a senior lecturer at a 
higher educational institution and secretary of a CPSU district 
committee in Volgograd and was head of a department in the 
Central Committee of Polozkov's Communist Party of the RSFSR. He 
is a leader of the Socialist Workers Party. 
  In the former Supreme Soviet he was cochairman of the 
Communists of Russia faction and dealt with questions of the 
work of the soviets and the development of local government. He 
enjoyed among democrat deputies the reputation of a "communist 
with whom you could negotiate." He ran for the Duma not from the 
Socialist Party, which was extremely unsuccessful, but preferred 
the company of the agrarians, who obviously had a better chance. 
  Ivan Rybkin won the competition for the post of speaker 
by a one-vote margin. In the democratic milieu, his victory was 
seen as a sign of a "Red revanche"; in the opposite camp, as the 
triumph of common sense. For the deputies who did not come into 
contact with Rybkin in the Supreme Soviet, and for the public at 
large even more, he remains Mr. X and "the man from nowhere." 
  After a week of the speaker's activity, an OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA observer asked representatives of a number of Duma 
factions and groups of deputies to introduce the chairman of the 
Duma to our readers. 
  Sergey Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord): 
  I have known Ivan Petrovich for three years and can say that 
he is for parliament a far more dependable leader than 
Khasbulatov in the former Supreme Soviet. He is restrained and 
purposeful. He senses intuitively that, despite the fact that he 
represents the communist-patriotic spectrum in the Duma, it is, 
for all that, in the interests of the whole house to support the 
minority also in order that it too be represented structurally 
and be heard and participate in debate. He is afraid of allowing 
a situation where there remain in the Duma only the right wing 
and where Zhirinovskiy and Travkin take turns at the podium. 
  His stated desire to form in the Duma a political "center" 
accords fully with ours. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
faction has made at times successful, at times unsuccessful, 
attempts to create some stratum between the radical wings so 
that if the speaker's intentions are sincere, we are prepared to 
interact with him. 
  Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party of Russia 
faction): 
  Rybkin is just the necessary compromise that it is 
permissible to reach in this Duma with this alignment of forces. 
It was clear, on the other hand, that a person oriented sharply 
to the left or sharply to the right could not have gotten 
elected to this position. And Rybkin is not a "revolutionary" of 
either left or right. 
  As far as his style of chairing the sittings is concerned, 
people may make of it what they will. I would prefer a stricter 
style. I would not switch on the microphones in the hall at 
all--only in case of a dire emergency. I believe that society 
has already passed the stage at which everyone was inordinately 
sensitive to whether a thing was "democratic" or "not 
democratic." We are now more in need not of what is connected 
with rights, but of what is connected with responsibility for 
the accorded rights. 
  Nikolay Lysenko (unregistered Russian Way faction): 
  Rybkin is a professional, of course, but he is a person not 
without inveterate apparatus habits. Despite the fact that by 
European standards he is still quite a young politician, he is a 
young politician "with an old suitcase." The communist baggage 
that he carries with him and the most profound imprint of the 
communist mentality in him are obvious to me. 
  I do not believe that Rybkin is the speaker whom the new 
Russia needs. He is, perhaps, a pretty good speaker for the 
troubled times in which we are living, even the optimum figure 
for harmonizing the actions of the Duma with the Federation 
Council and the president. But the new Russia should have a new 
speaker not so much in terms of his age as in terms of his 
ideological baggage. Sergey Baburin would for me, for example, 
have been a far more acceptable candidate for this office. 
  Gennadiy Burbulis (Russia's Choice faction): 
  We should have the courage to separate the idea of a person 
that was shaped by years of joint political struggle from his 
normal possibility of self-renewal. For this reason I decline 
comment on Mr. Rybkin's political past and believe that we may 
be quite sincere in supporting the formulas that he has 
promulgated as chairman of the State Duma. I personally, in 
particular. 
  Parliament exists so that people might have better lives. 
And 
our entire ideological struggle should be subordinated to this. 
I have the impression that Mr. Rybkin is interested in such a 
position, and in this sense I will help him, as a man. 
Sometimes, however, signs of a predetermined goal, which he is 
attempting to achieve as aggressively as possible, show through. 
There have been several topics where the natural right of the 
deputy minority, even if this has been one deputy, has been 
scornfully rejected. This is disturbing, it is impermissible. 
  Vyacheslav Marychev (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
faction): 
  Our faction voted for Rybkin. But I have a very guarded 
attitude toward him. I believe that this is an attempt to return 
to power by people who have already been there. But to avoid an 
intensification of the crisis in the Duma, the faction decided 
to vote for Rybkin, and we voted "Aye." 
  I complained to Rybkin about the fact that he had not 
recognized Lysenko. Although the faction gave me a telling-off 
for this and although I do not know Lysenko personally, I was 
angered by the disdain with which Rybkin had treated him. He 
apologized to Lysenko, it is true, but this episode reminded me 
of the communist past. 
  Irina Khakamada (unregistered Union of 12 December 
group of deputies): 
  I can say only one thing: Yesterday and the day before, the 
sittings were chaired by Speaker Rybkin; today they are being 
chaired by Mityukov. Speaker Rybkin is a representative of the 
Agrarian Party and of the pro-communist lobby, so to speak; 
Mityukov is a representative of Russia's Choice. I like the way 
the sittings were chaired yesterday and the day before better. 
That is, I mean that Rybkin is a person who knows how to do his 
job professionally.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin by Olga </F>
Bychkova] 
  [Text] Ivan Rybkin's appearance in the speaker's chair came 
as a surprise for many. Needless to say, his name was known 
still from his activities in the previous parliament, yet the 
image of the State Duma's head seemed to require greater 
refinement. Actually Rybkin was elected to the post of chairman 
by the skin of his teeth, polling the minimally required number 
of votes. 
  Incidentally, the fact that a representative from the 
agrarian-communist bloc was ultimately elected merely 
corroborated the expected orientation of the majority in 
parliament's lower chamber. But Rybkin, who swopped the 
Communist Party for the agrarians after the October events last 
year, immediately gave it to understand that he was prepared to 
relinquish party partialities for the general weal. And the 
beginning of his career as speaker was marked by a categorical 
demand made of the government that it should present in five 
days a programme for overcoming the crisis in the countryside. 
Moreover, the speaker himself was of the opinion that the 
beginning of the hard work to observe order in the Duma turned 
out to be quite expectable: he had imagined it precisely like 
this and considered the first sittings to be perfectly quiet. 
  MN: But, after all, there were attempts to disturb the 
normal flow of the session--when Zhirnovsky yelled whatever he 
wanted from the rostrum or when in the middle of the discussion 
procedure Nikolai Lysenko decided by all means to speak his mind 
from the rostrum about the Russian people being oppressed... No 
doubt, all of this will keep repeating. What are you going to 
undertake? 
  I.R.: I believe that no one is insured against this. It is 
desirable that sittings should be presided over in such a way 
that no such situations should arise in general. 
  MN: But no matter how it may be presided over, if 
Lysenko again decides to battle his way to the rostum at all 
costs... 
  I.R.: I know all the civilized norms of cutting this kind of 
acts short. It so happened that I had occasion to thoroughly 
study the experience of work at different parliaments existing 
in the world. It's a different matter that not everything is 
simple with these norms. Whatever is considered elementary in 
Britain, Germany or the Netherlands--for instance, the presence 
of a bailiff in the hall--may be perceived differently in our 
case... But a certain measure of inuring is already in evidence. 
If you take the Constitutional Court--its bailiff is a majestic, 
important-looking and urbane person. And a sturdy guy at that. 
He comes up and says: "Please, Sir let's leave the rostrum." And 
leave they do, you know. 
  There are different variants, too: penalties, fines, denial 
of the right to speak in the Duma for a certain time. Let's wait 
and see. Evidently, all these norms will have to be introduced 
gradually, with account to our mentality, not to provoke 
excessive irritation. I pin great hopes on the Duma's Council, 
on the leaders of political parties, factions and movements. 
Much will depend on the microclimate in the factions. Irritation 
and embitterness are neutralized by trust and respectfulness. 
  MN: And do you believe that Zhirinovsky, for one, will 
be receptive to respectfulness? 
  I.R.: Well, you know, at the beginning of the sittings we 
worked for three days on end without days-off. And I must say 
that Vladimir Zhirinovsky found a common language with Mikhail 
Poltoranin in situations when nobody even expected this. 
  MN: In what way do you believe does the present 
parliament differ from the previous one? 
  I.R.: The previous Supreme Soviet was smaller in numbers and 
therefore more controllable. Our Duma is somewhat more 
complicated. Putting it bluntly, this is in general a Congress 
held every day. But everyone understands that this must not be 
the case. There is a need for an efficient parliament. 
Therefore, as you have noticed, we reached a consensus quickly 
enough on how to institutionalize the Duma, organize factions 
and committees, and hold elections. Thorough work lies ahead, 
and only in the course of a mere 20 months if we exclude the 
beginning and the end. The role of factions increases as never 
before. They must coordinate their interests, and jointly with 
them--the political parties, organizations, social strata and 
population groups which they represent. The first week of the 
work is encouraging. 
  MN: Where do you believe lies the main danger for this 
parliament? 
  I.R.: There is the danger of repeating the rally-like nature 
of previous deputy sittings and "littering" legislative work 
with admixtures of various kinds. Therefore, let's say, we have 
worked for so long on procedural matters. 
  MN: And are there no external dangers? 
  I.R.: I understand what you are driving at. Let us hope that 
cooperation between the branches of authority will become 
closer, I would not even speak about interaction. It has proved 
dangerous to perceive the division of the authorities as their 
estrangement from one another. I believe that the October events 
have inoculated us against this. I have met with Shumeiko, with 
Vitruk and with the President alike. What kind of dangers can 
there be? You alone can inflict the greatest harm upon yourself. 
And if a person is prudent and receptive to someone else's 
opinion, he can avoid dangers. There is but one danger: if we 
find no accord, we may lose control over economic processes and 
hence over political ones. 
  There are organizational difficulties. For instance, the 
deputies lived during the first week at the Rossiya Hotel. Is it 
hard to live there? Yes, it is. It's literally a joint of 
natural kind. People of venerable age--the age of statesmanly 
maturity--are severed from their families and live in what is in 
effect a hostel. Two deputies have already had infarctions. And 
the reason lies solely in their conditions of life. These are 
people with established habits and with a healthy way of life. 
One of them, I can tell you, has in general never smoked or 
drunk. Is there a need to decide the question? Yes, there is. 
Deputies must be enabled to buy apartments and bring in their 
families. I am speaking about strictly prosaic things. Because I 
am convinced: the plan of law-drafting activities will not be 
implemented unless all these questions have been decided. Is it 
possible to find a solution? Of course, it is. Jointly with the 
two other branches of authority. 
  MN: What lessons have you drawn from Ruslan 
Khasbulatov's experience on the post of speaker? 
  I.R.: Substantial lessons. There are several of them. But 
since this discussion will be somewhat incorrect, I would not 
like to enlarge upon it. If Khasbulatov were next to me or in an 
equal capacity... 
  MN: Have your communist convictions undergone any 
changes? 
  I.R.: Communist persuasions have undergone cardinal changes 
all over the world, and especially in our country. Strictly 
speaking, besides the five communist-oriented parties which 
refused to take part in the elections, all the others, who are 
left of the centre, are our Russian left-wing social-democrats. 
Gennady Zyuganov is being quite correctly persuaded that he is a 
social-democrat, and he need not find excuses to justify himself 
in this. 
  We have accepted the diversity of the forms of ownership and 
management, and their equality before the law. If we happened to 
do to our country whatever has been done by the social-democrats 
of Sweden, the socialists of Austria, the socialists of France, 
and so on, what else could we wish our people and the 
representatives of our communist-oriented parties? When those 
dramatic days happened in October, my friends-agrarians, next to 
whom I had spent the whole of my life, were the first to come to 
me. After an unhurried, circumstantial conversation we decided 
to build an electoral association which would include the 
Agrarian Union, the agrarian trade union, the All-Russia Council 
of Collective Farms, and the associations of private farmers... 
A party plus trade unions--this is actually the agrarian variant 
of Britain's Labour Party. Moreover, it has successfully stood 
the test of elections. A fully specific, thoroughly political 
movement--the prototype of a party in the future. 
  The gravest consequences of crises have always been heaped 
on 
the countryside. The countryside pays for everything. It does 
this today as well--in chase of the reform's tempo. Is this 
justified? They received the crop, delivered it to the state, 
and for this grain they have not yet received any money since 
July. The debt runs to 1.5 trillion roubles. Nobody bothers to 
pay this money. A very formidable phenomenon is emerging in 
Moscow--rural peddling: person, coming from the village, takes 
with him as much as he can carry--home-made sausage, lard, 
butter, honey, and what else, and he begins selling this right 
at a Metro station. This is a sign of latent civil war, however 
hard it is to pronounce this. 
  And one more thing. In the 1930s in the family of my 
grandfather where there were seven children, my grandmother with 
two children alone happened to survive. And my grandfather 
himself is lying somewhere near Chita, we still do not know 
where his grave is. They died on fertile black earth from 
hunger, cold and disease because an effort was made to impose an 
idea. It was ruthless, though it was clear that this cut against 
life. I would greatly resent it if we revived the same in our 
approaches. I had great liking for Yegor Gaidar's team--young, 
clever and interesting people. Elegant if you like. But it seems 
to me that they have been trying to capture our monopolized 
economy with a head-on attack. Yet what is only possible is 
dismantling--not destruction. So that, for the same of my 
grandfather's memory and to prevent the repetition of whatever 
happened to him, I agreed to run on the general federal ticket 
of the Agrarian Party of Russia. 
  MN: What changes have taken place in your personal life 
upon your ascent to the post of speaker? 
  I.R.: None whatsoever besides additional work. My family may 
possibly have a sense of greater apprehension for me than 
before. But they don't speak about this. My parents feel keenly 
for me. I am their firstling, after me there were another 
four... My father had a series of insults after the October 
events. Although he is not yet too old a person. 
  MN: In what situations would you consider your stay at 
the post of speaker to be impossible for you? 
  I.R.: For the time being I see no reasons even to speak on 
this theme. I am convinced that those who voted against me will 
become my allies.

<F P=106> [Article by Voldemar Koreshkov: "Come to Your Senses, Miss </F>
Novodvorskaya: The Appeals of the Democratic Union of Russia Are 
Involved With Blood"] 
  [Text] The second congress of the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms began its work in the Moscow parliamentary 
center, and leaflets of the Russian Democratic Union party 
entitled "Fascism and Communism Outlawed" were distributed 
persistently at the entrance. 
  But what does V. Novodvorskaya, the scandalously well-known 
leader of the RDU [Russian Democratic Union], offer that is new? 
Well, nothing. That very same unpardonable extremism and the 
very same frenzied persistence to inflame the situation in 
society. 
  The expressions themselves are interesting: "troglodytic 
ideas," "Red cannibals," "enemies of the human race," etc. 
  It is possible, of course, to react in different ways to 
Zhirinovskiy's party and the Communists and to those results 
that characterize the elections to the State Duma. 
  But no kind of moral restrictions exist for V. 
Novodvorskaya. 
The RDU does not recognize the results of the elections, even if 
the whole solar system votes for the "red-browns." 
  It is not so much the barefaced malevolence and disregard 
for 
the law that puts one on guard. Far more dangerous are the 
instigating appeals. There is an appeal to the president of the 
Russian Federation in the leaflet to act with the new parliament 
just as was done with the Supreme Soviet. Support at the 
barricades is assured. There is a request "immediately to create 
a national guard from among his devoted followers and to arm it 
for the defense of democracy." 
  It turns out that RDU members "are ready to fight to the 
death for freedom, as in August 1991, and as on the night of 4 
October." 
  Come to your senses, Miss Novodvorskaya! We remember those 
tragedies. They should be a stern lesson for everyone. The 
revanchist delirium is akin to fascism. Again a summons to 
confrontation, a thirst for bloody conflicts. It is startling 
that everything is possible in Russia, and no one is responsible 
for his provocative appeals and actions. Everyone, as the saying 
goes, gets away with it unpunished. 
  The leaflet in many ways is directed at B.N. Yeltsin. Lord! 
Save our president from such advisers and defenders.

<F P=106> [Articles by Vasiliy Lipitskiy, doctor of philosophical </F>
sciences, and Kronid Lyubarskiy, deputy chief editor of NOVOYE 
VREMYA, on the success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
and Zhirinovskiy] 
  [Text] What lessons should be learned from the 
election victory of Zhirinovskiy, who actively employed 
national-patriotic slogans? And do the democrats need to 
intercept them from their political opponents? MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI authors have different views on this problem. 
<H5>  V. Lipitskiy: `Enemy Instead of Ally' </H5>
  The success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
and Zhirinovskiy is all the more remarkable in that it was 
achieved in the absence of serious organizational structures. It 
graphically demonstrated the power and attractiveness of 
patriotic phrases, even if reduced to the grotesque. Also 
notable is the fact that a majority of the electorate went for 
their noncommunist version, rejecting the old idioms. And now it 
remains merely to guess at the reason for this. 
  The "national-patriotic" opposition is the child and 
reflection of the current authorities, nurtured by their 
mistakes and symmetrically reflecting their characteristic 
features. 
  Of course, as befits a mirror reflection, its details, 
despite its entire similarity with the original, have an 
opposite sign. This applies to the generic characteristics of 
both the authorities and the opposition: "democratism" and 
"patriotism." 
  Whence the odd and illogical division into "patriots" and 
"democrats" as alternate political forces? Without delving even 
into hoary antiquity, to the sources of the struggles of the 
Slavophiles and Westerners, it can be seen how difficult it has 
been to avoid such a division. Any authorities use patriotism as 
an argument in their favor, in support of preservation of the 
status quo, and our ancien regime resorted to this method 
particularly sedulously. The situation pushed those who were 
opposed to the regime into a disregard for patriotic values, 
therefore. 
  The dissident movement in the USSR up to 1985 was not 
mass-based, popular even less. It was highly elite and pro-West. 
With the start of perestroyka, the situation changed 
considerably. 
  Sometimes you simply have to wonder: Where did all these 
swarms of intrepid fighters against totalitarianism come from? 
What were they doing until they learned from the mouth of the 
general secretary that free-thinking was allowed, and 
encouraged, even? Were they suffering in the snares of lies and 
lack of rights? By no means! Unmurmuringly they "cooperated with 
the regime" in the ranks of pioneer, Communist Youth League, and 
trade union organizations and also in the ranks of the Volunteer 
Society for Assistance to the Army, Air Force, and Navy and the 
Water-Rescue Society. 
  It is clear that this conformist environment could not have 
created its own ideology but adopted that prepared in advance by 
the dissidents. The basis thereof was the idea of democracy--and 
it was clear to all without needless words, what is more, that 
Western democracy would be taken as the model. Whence arose a 
dilemma, just as simple and convincing as it is erroneous: 
Democrats are the supporters of reforms and familiarization with 
world, that is to say, Western, civilization; patriots are 
retrograde persons, restorers of the past, and the enemies of 
transformations. 
  Such is the prehistory in principle, which by no means 
excludes special cases. There was also an informal 
national-patriotic movement, also of the opposition, although 
the democrats shunned it and expressed doubt as to its 
independence of the regime. Muslim traditionalism began to 
gather momentum in the republics, but overseas influence also 
performed not the least role here. 
  The rejection of patriotic emphases, granted all its 
conditional nature, proved to be a miscalculation made by the 
democrats. The flank was surrendered without resistance, 
although, with a preponderance in the news media at that time, 
an equality of positions could have been achieved, at least. But 
the tactics of the democratic forces at that time were 
determined by the forecast of the lengthy and gradual 
transformation of society. 
  Inertia is one explanation of why the democrats, having 
become the authorities, continued (and now continue) to behave 
as the opposition. The struggle against totalitarianism had 
pushed to the forefront people with the optimum set of 
attributes for such a specific mission. They feel themselves to 
be, as before, overthrowers and are far less inspired and 
specific when it is a question of constructive tasks. The 
patriotic idea, national interests, and power projection for 
this pleiad of destroyers are merely fragments of the old world, 
in whose breakup they were so thoroughly involved that they did 
not notice how reasonable limits had been exceeded. 
  In addition, there came with them into power a pro-West 
orientation, which acquired additional impetus inasmuch as the 
West discovered in Russia entirely material interests. 
Politicians who allowed themselves to speak about this out loud 
quickly found themselves isolated and out of a job. 
  This is why the authorities began so belatedly (only as of 
the start of 1993, seemingly, when new arguments in the struggle 
against the Supreme Soviet were needed) to master the patriotic 
vocabulary. This proved difficult--there was still the desire to 
utter the sacramental "I do not believe!" And the people uttered 
it at the elections on 12 December. 
  The radical democrats had acquired a new enemy. They came to 
life noticeably--a crisis of the genre was manifestly perceived 
after the October events. Now once again there was someone to 
implacably combat, and the threat that the slow-moving reforms 
so sorely needed was discovered. And the very first clashes 
revealed the increased divergence of the ideas of democratism 
and patriotism, which increasingly resembled Kipling's East and 
West: Never would the twain meet. 
  We can only wonder at the low trainability of already 
venerable politicians who had succumbed to panic in the face of 
their failure. They were unable to think up anything better than 
to call together an anti-fascist front. And these are people in 
whose hands are power and responsibility for the fate of the 
country, and patriotism, consequently, is their field! 
  This portends nothing good. A choice between an 
nonindependent policy deprived of national priorities and 
bellicose nationalism is no choice. A democratism unadapted to 
Russian conditions has few chances of survival and even fewer 
chances of becoming a dependable barrier to the far more 
customary autocracy. And ultra-patriotism (it is into this niche 
that the authorities are sedulously shoving even very moderate 
patriotic impulses) also gravitates toward dictatorial forms. 
The discrediting of the democratic idea, on the other hand, 
which ensues from the extremely unsuccessful forms of 
embodiment, is making it a feeble counterweight to the growing 
national self-awareness, hurt national feeling, and mass 
discontent at the progress of the reforms. 
  The hounding of patriotism and contrasting it with democracy 
are extremely unproductive. The synthesis thereof--democratic 
patriotism (Rutskoy's term, which was undeservedly 
criticized)--is needed particularly in Russia. And the future is 
on the side of the political forces that know how to unite 
people around national values and interests on the basis of 
democratic forms of the organization of society. 
<H5>  Kronid Lyubarskiy: `Monkey's Paw' </H5>
  Now, when the voices of fascists are for the first time 
starting to be heard within the Russian Parliament and the 
democrats have simply not recovered, seemingly, from the shock 
induced by this fact, it is worth remembering one, not all that 
significant, event, which occurred at the end of June at the 
Constitutional Conference. 
  After two weeks of work in groups, a plenary session, at 
which the rapporteurs presenting the viewpoints of all the 
groups on various aspects of the Constitution were to have 
spoken, was scheduled. Six persons were chosen from the 
political parties and grassroots organizations. Among those 
applying to speak was Vladimir Zhirinovskiy also, but his 
candidacy was during the vote in the group of parties rejected. 
  Imagine the astonishment when the chairman at the plenary 
session called to speak, instead of the rapporteur chosen by the 
group, Zhirinovskiy. With evident pleasure, the leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia delivered his somewhat 
insolent and freewheeling speech, the end of which was covered 
in, I shall not say tumultuous, but quite loud, applause. 
  Some 150 representatives of the political parties had simply 
been spat upon. After the session, the democrats, at home in the 
"highest spheres," explained with consternation and with shame: 
Well, you understand, Zhirinovskiy is for strong presidential 
authority.... 
  I also am for strong presidential authority. But no 
political 
goal, even the most noble, can be achieved with the aid of 
"allies" from the camp of totalitarianism. A price that 
obliterates the entire meaning of the victory that has been won 
has to be paid for such "assistance." Support for the democrats 
by fascists or communists is the monkey's paw from the 
well-known parable of the talisman capable of fulfilling wishes, 
but always in the most appalling way. So when its young owner 
made a wish for riches, there was an immediate knock on the door 
from a messenger who informed him of the death of his much-loved 
father, who had left him an inheritance. All other miracles 
wrought by the monkey's paw were of the same kind. 
  I cannot prove this, but I have the continual suspicion that 
Zhirinovskiy's occupation of television in the fateful first 10 
days of December was not simply Bragin's stupidity or a 
spineless understanding of "pluralism." Zhirinovskiy was put on 
the screen as an ally in the cause of propaganda of the 
Constitution. People wanted to "use" him, but the "monkey's paw" 
effect worked unswervingly. The price that we will all pay for 
Zhirinovskiy's "support" of the Constitution has not as yet been 
fully recognized, it would seem. 
  Yet by the time Zhirinovskiy was put on the screen, his 
political views were no secret. I will quote merely the 
following significant words: "How I dream that Russian soldiers 
will wash their boots in the warm water of the Indian Ocean.... 
That any platoon of Russian soldiers could bring order to be 
bear in any space.... The Army cannot get stronger in military 
recruiting offices and barracks. It needs a purpose, a 
mission.... The Russian Army would have to revive again today 
were....it to accomplish an operation to establish Russia's new 
borders in a southerly direction" (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, "Last 
Dash to the South," which was signed to press on 28 September 
1993, over two months prior to the Duma elections). 
  If what has just been quoted does not constitute the formal 
elements of a crime as specified by Article 71 of the Criminal 
Code of the Russian Federation ("Propaganda of war, in whatever 
form it is conducted"), I would inquire of Aleksey Kazannik, 
general procurator of the Russian Federation, what in this case 
he considers such propaganda. And does not his own silence fall 
under another article of the Criminal Code, Article 172, which 
reads: "....an official's nondischarge or inappropriate 
discharge of his duties as a consequence of a negligent or 
unconscientious attitude toward them that has appreciably 
damaged state or public interests or the rights and interests of 
the citizens protected by law"? 
  I greatly fear that the tolerant attitude of representatives 
of the Russian power establishment toward fledgling Russian 
fascism has deep roots. It is hardly that any of them harbor 
affections for fascism. But they lack immunity; their blood 
lacks a sufficient number of antibodies immediately and 
decisively rejecting totalitarianism and its methods in any form. 
  The spirit of totalitarianism is with frightening constancy 
being revived in the hearts of democrats, and some of its 
methods seem acceptable to them, even, and its support, 
permissible. I recall the discussion at the Constitutional 
Conference of the article on the citizen's right to freedom of 
movement on the territory of the Russian Federation, when there 
suddenly appeared a proposal, submitted by it is not known whom, 
for restricting this freedom. It was not a question of some 
temporary measure, but of the introduction of restrictions in an 
unalterable part of the Constitution determining the basic 
rights and liberties of the citizens! 
  A spiritual leader of Russian democracy, Father Gleb 
Yakunin, 
the "Russian Makarios," delivered an impassioned speech in 
support of these restrictions, alluding to the wishes of the 
electorate. Well, "yesterday's slave, tired of liberty," 
frequently "demands the lash." These demands can be heeded. It 
was the unanimous support of Muscovites and their anger at the 
"capture" of Moscow's markets by "people of Caucasian 
nationality" and so forth to which Moscow's City Hall alluded 
when introducing the "special procedure of residence" in the 
capital. It counted on the same when adopting the decision on 
the expulsion of the refugees, for whom it was required to 
display concern by an international convention that had been 
signed by Russia. 
  The problem is not only and not so much the fact that the 
spirit of Moscow's initiative rapidly spread through Russia and 
was echoed in the "near abroad." The most frightening aspect is 
that each such step is a substantial contribution to a revival 
of the "ethics" of totalitarianism. 
  Only by having defined misanthropic ideologies as an 
absolute 
evil and having rejected them once and for all, patiently 
explaining their essence, will we have an opportunity to bar the 
way to fascism. Zhirinovskiy's victory is merely the first bell. 
We need to be able to hear it.

<F P=106> [Article by G.Yu.Yu.: "Scoreboard"] </F>
  [Text] After the new Constitution has with difficulty 
overcome the 50 percent barrier, its further role appears, as 
before, to be a double one. On the one hand it unties B.N.Y.'s 
hands, permitting the establishment of a regime of personal 
power, on the other, it also contains the possibility of a split 
in the executive in the center along "president-government" 
lines. In addition, the artificial removal from the draft of 
many regional pillars of constitutional order in Russia (the 
clause on the sovereignty of the republics, the Federal Treaty, 
and others) is fraught with new representations from the regions. 
  The stories of the "success of fascism in Russia" 
circulating 
among the radical democrats do not withstand even the first 
contact with reality. 
  Presidential authority itself excommunicated from the 
election campaign the most active nationalist groupings (the 
Russian National Union, the Constitutional Democratic Party, the 
NRP [National Republican Party]). The authorities gave the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] with their own hands the 
former's potential electorate (6-8 percent of the vote, 
according to a number of estimates). 
  The rapid growth of the LDPR pertained to the last two weeks 
before the elections. It is hard not to notice the sharp 
contrast between the soothing tone of the political statement of 
B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, of 13 December 
and the hysterical response of the radical democrats regarding 
the "fascist breakthrough in Russia." These facts compel us to 
treat attentively the rumors circulating in the most varied 
political circles concerning the preventive funding of the 
LDPR's election campaign by certain structures of the executive. 
  In the initial election scenario "Zhirinovskiy's party" was, 
by all accounts, assigned the role of "pump" designed to "draw 
off" from one-third to one-half of the electorate of the 
Communists. 
  And the idea of using the Federal Assembly as a 
"stabilization" trump card in the presidential game would seem 
tactically justified. V. Zhirinovskiy, loudly stating his 
pro-presidential sympathies, is together with S. Filatov already 
being seen as a candidate for the position of speaker of the 
State Duma in the semi-secret political consultations that have 
begun. 
  The success of the LDPR strikes through, virtually, the 
parliamentary scenario of the radical democrats counting if only 
with a minimal preponderance in the ballot on "filtering" the 
government and subordinating to themselves the power structures 
and, consequently, the president also. The series of dismissals 
of high-ranking officials in the last two weeks had underlying 
motives, first, the need to identify and punish the "fall guys" 
and those "to blame" for the surge of Zhirinovskiy and the 
Communists, second, an attempt by the radicals prior to the 
opening of the Federal Assembly session to realize if only some 
of their "personnel preparations" (hitting at the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord and so forth). 
  It was the regional elites who achieved the election of the 
majority of their candidates to the Federation Council. At least 
three scenarios of the behavior of the Federation Council, 
depending on the breakdown of forces in the lower house of 
parliament, are likely. 
  Scenario 1. The majority that takes shape in the Federation 
Council backs the factions and personalities that are dominant 
in the State Duma. This is possible given the rapid 
"domestication" of V. Zhirinovskiy and the prolongation of the 
question of the government, if this is followed by the consent 
of the "agro-communist" faction. 
  Scenario 2. The majority that takes shape in the Federation 
Council begins to orient itself unequivocally toward President 
B. Yeltsin. 
  Scenario 3. The Federation Council prefers to distance 
itself 
from the State Duma and from the president, assuming the role of 
a kind of counterpart of the former Federation Council. 
  In all three cases the role of the Federation Council will 
be 
far more significant than that imputed to it by the new 
Constitution. In all likelihood, this will be manifested in the 
first weeks of work of the Federal Assembly. 
  The power structures do not have direct representation in 
the 
Federal Assembly. V. Zhirinovskiy, meanwhile, not a military 
leader and having no chance of becoming such, of course, is 
articulating a kind of ideology of militant "liberal patriotism" 
connected with the rapid growth of influence of the power 
structures 3-5 October and in the weeks since October. 
  Within the framework of programmed reductions approximately 
500,000 servicemen will be discharged from the army in the next 
two years. Considering that even now hundreds of thousands of 
families of military persons "expelled" from East Europe, the 
Baltic, the Transcaucasus, and Central Asia are without housing, 
it would be natural to expect that interest in V. Zhirinovskiy, 
who is promising the military the distribution of land entails 
and full social protection, will be manifested primarily among 
the middle and junior officers, the majority of whom voted for 
the LDPR. The generals, on the other hand, are in sympathy with 
Zhirinovskiy's statements concerning an increase in the army's 
role in the country's foreign and domestic policy. 
  Nor do experts rule out V. Zhirinovskiy's support for the 
political claims of the leadership of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs connected with a tightening of the machinery of 
repression and a broadening of the rights of the operational 
search and investigation subdivisions justified by the fight 
against crime. 
  Up to the fall of 1993 B.N.Y. played a Bonapartist game on 
the contradictions between the republics within the Russian 
Federation, the sparsely populated resource-extracting oblasts, 
and the traditional Russian agro-industrial regions. Then, when 
the contours of large-scale geopolitical alliances oriented to a 
considerable extent against the Kremlin (the Urals Republic, the 
Greater Volga and Siberian Agreement associations) emerged, the 
pendulum of the president's regional policy swung in the 
directly opposite direction, which was expressed in the draft 
constitution and, as a retaliatory response, in a surreptitious 
increase in separatism. 
  The appearance at the political forefront of the figure of 
V. 
Zhirinovskiy, the "total unitarist" and "ethnocratic 
imperialist" provocatively manipulated by the presidential 
grouping, corresponds splendidly to the idea of Russian 
disintegration: the response of the regional leaders, who have 
come round from the October coma, will be unequivocally 
separatist and anti-Kremlin. Experts of various persuasions see 
in the future the possibility of a quite rapid collapse of the 
traditional Russian ethno-state nucleus into puppet 
"principalities." It does not need to be said that V. 
Zhirinovskiy is incapable of showing himself to be a great-power 
leader like figures of the National Salvation Front or the 
Russian National Assembly.

Zhirinovskiy's Falcons: The History and the People of the 
`Victory Party'"] 
  [Text] In the popular perception, the party that so 
amazingly won in the elections, consists of one person, and even 
he came out of nowhere. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy himself told the 
press on that triumphal Tuesday that they are the ones who "do 
not know LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] politicians. 
The Russian people, however, do know them, and that is why they 
voted for them." Nevertheless, it seems that the people had 
other reasons. As to the history of his party, it is still 
shrouded in semi-mystery. 
<H5>  The Beginning. From Novodvorskaya to Oleynik </H5>
  It is unlikely that Mr. Zhirinovskiy would have made it to 
the current pinnacle with the help of the LDPR had he not been 
expelled from it at some point in the past. 
  He appeared on Russia's political arena in May 1989, on the 
second day of the founding congress of the Democratic Union. 
Only in those naive times could a person, having walked into 
this sort of meeting for the first time, find himself elected on 
the spot into the Democratic Union's coordinating council for 
his eloquence--only to be expelled a couple of days later "for 
communist leanings." 
  Having spent the summer and the fall at rallies, in the 
winter of 1990 Zhirinovskiy received an invitation to join 
forces with Vladimir Bogachev, who also had left the Democratic 
Union and founded the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. At the 
LDP's founding congress in March, Mr. Bogachev, impressed by the 
legal, linguistic, and oratorical luggage of his partner, 
promotes him to chairmanship, while settling for the job of the 
party's coordinator himself. At the time the LDP consisted of 
about 20 members, and anyone who wanted to could get a deputy 
mandate and a membership card at the congress. 
  Mr. Zhirinovskiy concentrated his activities on the 
so-called 
Centrist Bloc, created in June 1990--an alliance of dwarf 
parties that had the obvious sympathy of the CPSU's Central 
Committee, whose member Boris Oleynik openly backed the bloc in 
general and Zhirinovskiy in particular. Mr. Zhirinovskiy's 
former confederates maintain that it was at this stage that his 
rhetoric began to change significantly, acquiring populist and 
imperial overtones. 
  In October 1990 the LDP chairman received an invitation to 
attend the congress of the Liberal International [LI] in 
Helsinki. (By the way, Mr. Zhirinovskiy still refers to his 
"ties with the LI," although the leadership of this union said 
right then that "any cooperation with Zhirinovskiy and his party 
is out of question"). Having returned from the capital of Suomi 
[Finland], the LDP chairman learned that he had been expelled 
from the party. 
  Observers are inclined to believe that Mssrs. Bogachev and 
Zhirinovskiy simply could not agree on how to apportion the 
illusory power over the party. Bogachev's supporters insisted 
that they expelled the competitor for ideological reasons--"for 
pro-communist activities in a centrist bloc." Zhirinovskiy's 
group maintains that Bogachev simply was covering up his 
financial transgressions (Zhirinovskiy's attempt, however, to 
prove it with the help of the OBKhSS [Department for Combating 
the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation] and the 
court failed). 
  It should be noted that, according to Bogachev, "At the time 
Zhirinovskiy's name did not attract any sponsors or money to the 
party. He definitely was alone--without any structures behind 
him." 
  A hastily convened (with the help of the Centrist Bloc) 
conference of Zhirinovskiy's group did the reverse--expelled 
Bogachev and approved as "vice Zhirinovskiy" Akhmet Khalitov, an 
elderly water-tower operator in a kolkhoz in the environs of 
Moscow. 
  Since then the fortunes of the current victor began to rise 
swiftly. The LDP leader began to appear on television. According 
to Mr. Bogachev, "Zhirinovskiy's views after the split underwent 
an incredibly rapid evolution." In January 1991 the proposal of 
the "committee for national salvation of the USSR," drafted by 
Zhirinovskiy and two other "Centrist Bloc leaders" Vladimir 
Voronin and Valeriy Skurlatov, was made public; among other 
things, the proposal advocated imposing a state of emergency and 
disbanding all parties. (When, half a year later, Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy was reminded of this at the election campaign press 
conference of the presidential candidate, Zhirinovskiy demanded 
that journalist Sergey Parkhomenko be removed from the studio 
"for provocations.") The Ministry of Justice registered the 
LDPSU [Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union) in April 
1991 (before the CPSU); it turned out later that the lion's 
share of the required 5,000 signatures had been falsified, and 
in August 1992 the Russian Ministry of Justice annulled the 
registration (restoring it again, however, in November). On 12 
June 1992 Vladimir Zhirinovskiy became a fact of public 
conscience, having come in third in the race for the title of 
the president of Russia. 
  To this day, only one sponsor of his campaign is known for 
certain--the head of the Galant concern Andrey Zavidiya, who was 
on the ballot as his vice president and who, after the putsch 
and the dissolution of the CPSU, took upon himself the financing 
of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper. 
<H3>  `The Inner Party.' Military-Industrial Complex Heroes From 
the Shadow Cabinet </H3>
  The LDP structure is designed to be strictly a pyramid: "the 
party--the Central Committee--the Supreme Council, consisting of 
five persons--Chairman Zhirinovskiy. In reality, however, the 
"salt of the LDP" and its brain center is the "inner party"--the 
LDP's shadow cabinet. 
  Interestingly, there are only a very few LDP veterans in its 
current elite. As soon as the party got down to "serious 
business," Mr. Khalitov, the water-tower operator, left the 
party "for reasons of advanced age." Besides Zhirinovskiy 
himself, only two "veteran swordsmen" may be counted among the 
LDP's top echelon. 
  Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, the party's deputy chairman and "the 
minister of the economy" in the shadow cabinet, a physicist, has 
known Zhirinovskiy since 1983 from working together in the Mir 
publishing house. In the party, his responsibilities include 
organizational matters and the PRAVDA ZHIRINOVSKOGO newspaper. 
Until then he worked as an editor in the Sovetskaya 
Entsiklopedia publishing house, and before that, he worked for a 
quite a while in Algeria. Viktor Bogatyy, 46, a year ago gave up 
his Supreme Council membership and the post of "the minister of 
foreign economic relations" in the shadow cabinet because of a 
heart surgery. He now intends to return. He is the president of 
the Eksodin company (insurance, real estate, commerce) and the 
owner of seven similar companies; in the past, for many year a 
staff member of the [Soviet] trade representation in Great 
Britain, and then later a deputy editor in chief of the 
VNESHNYAYA TORGOVLYA magazine. 
  It appears that the party owes its successful campaign to 
the 
"second draft": relatively young people who came to the LDP 
after the 1991 presidential elections as a rather cohesive group 
with its own hierarchy and remarkably similar biographies. The 
current membership of the shadow cabinet is estimated by various 
party functionaries to be between 20 and 40 people; its 
structure is not rigid, moreover; it practically is not 
subordinate to the party's Supreme Council, but is formed and 
acts at its own discretion. It is believed that the party 
maintains control over it, since the head of the cabinet, Mr. 
Vengerovskiy, is a member of the Supreme Council. 
  Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, 40, is the "deputy prime minister" 
and "the head of intelligence" in the shadow cabinet, No. 8 on 
the party list, served for a long time as an officer in the 
military space program; after that he worked on secret topics in 
the same field in research centers; he maintains that he has 
"conceptual experience in counterintelligence," and was the head 
of a corresponding main administration in the State Committee 
for Computing Technology. 
  Mikhail Musatov, the "deputy for defense affairs" in the 
shadow cabinet, also was an officer in the military space 
program. He joined the party in 1991. 
  Viktor Kobelev, 50, a member of the LDP Supreme Council, and 
No. 2 on the party list. In the past a vice dean of the Ministry 
of Heavy Machine Building's professional training institute. 
  Sergey Abeltsev, 32, member of the Supreme Council and "the 
minister of security," is No. 9 on the party list. A former GRU 
[Main Intelligence Directorate] officer (according to other 
sources, he combined this service with assignments for the KGB). 
  Andrey Mitrofanov, 31, "the minister of foreign affairs," in 
the past represented the USSR MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] 
at the Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. 
  Sergey Barskiy, "the minister of internal affairs," a former 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officer, now works for a 
private agency. 
  Viktor Lymar, "the minister of science and technology," is a 
product of the Radio Industry Scientific Research Center. 
  As we can see, the "core" of the shadow cabinet noticeably 
revolves around sectors of the military-industrial complex, in 
particular, the space industry and nuclear power generation 
(especially those under the control of special services). 
Vladimir Gusev, the former deputy minister for chemistry and 
timber in Ryzhkov's government (No. 11 on the list), and 
Academician Aleksey Zvyagin, currently teaching at the Commerce 
Academy, give the list and the cabinet respectability. 
  Mr. Vengerovskiy maintains that "the shadow cabinet, which 
resembles the Rand Corporation, functions without remuneration." 
Writer Eduard Limonov and well-known rock-nazis Andrey Arkhipov 
and Sergey Zharikov did not fit with the cabinet (according to 
Vengerovskiy--"because of their frivolous attitude and 
zealotry"). 
<H5>  The New Generation Chooses </H5>
  According to Mr. Zhebrovskiy, the flow of people who wanted 
to join the LDPR especially swelled during the last week before 
12 December. It still has not receded, which anyone walking into 
the headquarters at Rybnykov Lane in Moscow will easily see for 
himself. The party's average age (over 30) has been declining 
lately. The procedure of joining the party is still simple: an 
application, a photo, a 200-ruble membership fee, and the card 
is issued on the spot. Or not issued, if one does not want it. 
Of the 50,000 membership cards printed some time back, about 
1,500 still have not been used. 
  There is no system of registration, so new members can 
easily 
escape paying membership dues (1 percent of the declared 
earnings a month). As Mr. Zhebrovskiy says: "Who wants to go 
looking for your money?!" Just recently he maintained that the 
entire income of the indigent LDPR consists of membership dues. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  How many of them were there four years ago--Voronins, 
Skurlatovs, marginal chairmen of parties of peace, individual, 
and other assorted centrism! For all 10 days after the 
elections, I have had visions of them gnawing on their pillows 
in impotent envy: "Had I been more careful in choosing friends, 
I could have, too!"

From the Chief's Entourage"] 
  [Text] "The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
is the party of one man--Zhirinovskiy," say his loyal 
confederates who saw the leader all the way to the State Duma, 
only to be left behind. 
<H5>  The Marriageable Pensioner </H5>
  Looking through the list of candidates for the State Duma 
from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, I discovered a 
horrible mistake that had found its way into it. Akhmet 
Khalitov, the party's general secretary and deputy chairman, and 
basically Zhirinovskiy's right hand man, was listed as No. 74! 
And on top of that identified as "an agricultural worker." 
  "So what is it, Akhmet Kharisovich," I ask him, "is it 
really 
an error? Or court intrigues?" 
  Kharitov is sitting across the table from me, and by the way 
he speaks--with an effort--I can see that he is also asking 
himself this question, for the millionth time. "They told me at 
the electoral commission that it was a computer error," the 
general secretary grasps a straw in order not to lose faith in 
his old comrade. 
  The general secretary has lived through a life that, as he 
puts it, would put Zhirinovskiy's in the shade. 
  "In 1989 I retired," says Khalitov, "and seriously got into 
politics. I believe that retirement affords you freedom of 
action, independence, and wisdom. In 1990, when I had already 
set up a social-democratic cell with other like-minded people, I 
met Zhirinovskiy and decided to merge with his party." 
  Zhirinovskiy made him the No. 2 person in his apparat, gave 
him the title of the minister of food in the shadow cabinet, and 
took him on a trip to Iraq. 
  "Akhmet Kharisovich, do you trust Zhirinovskiy? Can he be 
mean and cynical toward the people?" 
  "I have not seen any major unethical things on his part; as 
to minor everyday things, this is, of course, inevitable. 
Cynicism does occasionally raise its head in him. In 1991, when, 
as you recall, Zhirinovskiy was running for the president of 
Russia, he told me: "Akhmet Kharisovich, you are my most loyal 
comrade--you should go on the ballot as my vice president. While 
at the same time he proposed for that spot Andrey Zavidiya, a 
shallow man who later cheated the party of 100,000 rubles.... 
  "I have devoted three years of my life to him and him only, 
and I do not think he will do another mean thing to me. As to 
party work, there will always be enough for me to do--in 
particular, I want to organize a council of geniuses. We already 
have a draft solution for the ecological problem on a national 
scale, while at the same time doubling or tripling production." 
  At the end of the interview, Khalitov really warmed up and 
went on elaborating on the beauty of his draft projects; in his 
oratorical ardor, he stretched his arm out, pointing a finger 
somewhere between my eyes; he would suddenly bend his head 
forward, speaking in a disjointed and theatrical manner. A 
Zhirinovskiy in old age.... 
<H5>  Twice Unclaimed </H5>
  The deputy pie slid past the noses of two other key figures 
in the party apparat--the chief of the ideological department, 
Sergey Putin (for some reason he wanted to use his mother's 
surname), and the chief of the international department, Yuriy 
Vasyutin. There is a lot of resemblance: Both are about 50, 
white-haired, with nervous fingers, and nobly poorly clothed. 
Both are in the humanities and in addition to efforts on behalf 
of the party teach science. 
  Putin is a candidate of historic sciences, an assistant 
professor at one of the Moscow universities. In the past, as I 
was told, he taught at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Tall 
and youthful-looking, he asked me to delay the interview for a 
short while. "One of my graduating students will be here 
momentarily; she usually writes down my thoughts." This time, 
however, I had to write his thoughts down--the graduating 
student never showed up. 
  Putin joined the LDPR in 1991. He was attracted by 
"Zhirinovskiy's nonstandard views" on many problems, in 
particular on the ethnic issue. The author of one of the 
versions of the party program. Calls himself "more an ideologue 
than a politician." 
  "The LDPR is a party of a leader." he says. "As long as 
Zhirinovskiy is here, there is a party; Zhirinovskiy goes--there 
is no party. He is the first and the only politician in Russia 
capable of keeping the West on its toes. And therefore it is 
quite justifiable that Zhirinovskiy wants to become the father 
of the nation." 
  Until May 1992, Zhirinovskiy used the slogans of LDPR's 
extreme right wing; later, until the summer of 1993, he was more 
attracted to the rhetoric of the party's left-wing--the 
communists and social-democrats. 
  "By horoscope, Zhirinovskiy," continued the chief party 
ideologist, "is a Taurus and a Dog, which indicates that he has 
a strong personality. Unlike Yeltsin, he is a Personality, with 
a capital "P." He is also a master of political impromptu, and 
in principle he has his own political views." 
  "But, as you yourself said, he tends to change them...." 
  "If he goes back on his slogans in the Duma, the VPK 
[military-industrial complex] and the national industry will 
simply stop financing him." 
  The phenomenon of a Zhirinovskivite intellectual was 
explained to me by his colleague, Yuriy Vasyukov. He has been 
the party's member for a year and a half, has, as he says, four 
higher degrees--one technical and three in the humanities. He is 
a restless man--he has changed dozens of jobs and currently 
teaches in one of the capital city institutions of higher 
learning "on an hourly basis." 
  "Before perestroyka I, like most intellectuals," says the 
chief of international affairs, "thought a lot about the 
shortcomings of the existing state system, discussed with 
friends the ills of the social system. When Yeltsin was elected 
president, I thought: Here, our time has come, now we will be 
able to implement the ideas born in such labor pains. Alas, hope 
is what sustains the young. Once again we found ourselves 
unclaimed. A small group of people shifted from one set of 
chairs into another, while we remained outside the mainstream of 
active public life. 
  Meanwhile, continued Vasyutin, it turned out that the new 
leadership was unable to resolve many problems facing the 
nation. What were they supposed to do? Democratic Russia would 
not take them. Only the LDPR kept its doors open. Zhirinovskiy 
personally received everyone. He even placed ads with the 
employment bureau--to expand his staff. There is no question 
that Zhirinovskiy is a wonderful person. 
  Already on the way out, Vasyutin for some reason remembered 
his parents "suffering penniless in the Crimea." "You will not 
believe what a blow to my heart it was when the Soviet Union 
fell apart." Suddenly, two large tears rolled from his eyes. A 
glass of boiled water saved him from an imminent--as it looked 
to me--fainting spell. 
<H5>  The King's Tailors </H5>
  The LDPR apparat always consisted of about 10 persons. Three 
members of Zhirinovskiy's shadow cabinet held extreme right 
positions in it: All-Russia Investigations Agency's Director 
Eduard Limonov; Minister of Information Andrey Arkhipov, and 
Minister of Culture and Youth Affairs Sergey Zharikov. The two 
latter individuals are engineers by education, about 35 years 
old. Arkhipov used to do some work for ARGUMENTY I FAKTY when he 
met Zhirinovskiy in 1990 during the memorable "Solidarity March" 
from Moscow to the Baltics. Zharikov was a soloist in the rock 
group DK and joined the LDPR in the same year. 
  They penned the SOKOL ZHIRINOVSKOGO [ZHIRINOVSKIY'S FALCON] 
newspaper. The sharp-clawed bird on the front page spreads its 
wings over the territory from Alaska to Finland, inclusive. "At 
the first stage of the new policy," wrote Arkhipov, "there will 
be an accelerated return--perhaps even forcible--of the nations 
to their language traditions. Then they will gain great 
self-sufficiency." 
  Zharikov was tougher: "When only one or two representatives 
are left of the so-called minor ethnic groups, these insects 
will finally understand why they have been born onto this earth 
and that they have lost: They will prostrate themselves at the 
feet of the one they had insulted so long and with impunity. At 
the feet of the Russian Master." 
  Not too long ago the two ministers left the hospitable party 
in order to start one of their own. 
  "Almost all slogans spun out by Zhirinovskiy had been 
conceived by Zharikov and myself," says Arkhipov. "Ten minutes 
before a rally we would write in huge letters on pieces of 
paper, for instance: "America, return Alaska to Russia!" I would 
raise the piece of paper in front of Zhirinovskiy and he would 
deliver the slogan beautifully, right there on the spot. His 
chief trait is the ability to catch an idea in flight and 
immediately present it to the public in the right way. And 
another thing: Zhirinovskiy is an unfulfilled promise of a great 
saxophone player." 
  In Murom, says Zharikov, where two years ago the LDPR held a 
rally, the crowd was ecstatic over Zhirinovskiy. We were the 
conductors: As soon as he veered away, we would cross our arms, 
signaling him to stop--and Zhirinovskiy would stop. Generally, 
he is very good in sensing the mood of the crowd, and this, in 
return, gets him excited. I remember, he got a letter from some 
old woman, who wrote: Thank you, Vladimir Volfovich, you are our 
only defender. He got so sentimental over it that it took half 
an hour to get him back in shape. As a person, he is very, very 
lonely. He is a king, but a naked one. We were the ones who 
dressed him in our slogans. 
<H3>  From Sokolniki to the Indian Seas, Vladimir Volfovich Is the 
Strongest? </H3>
  Right-wing radicals have clearly exaggerated the extent of 
their service to the ordinary folk. Let us recall: It was only 
recently that TASS (!) reported on the first congress of the 
dwarf LDPSU [Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union], 
which was held in the....Palace of Congresses. This means that 
even then there were some serious forces behind the chief falcon 
of the country, forces that even today prefer not to come out 
into the limelight. In the spring of 1990, the party joined 
forces with an organization with an unreal name--the Centrist 
Moderate-Radical Bloc. Its gatherings took place in no less 
comfortable quarters, while considerably more representative 
meetings of informals huddled in basements (when they were not 
dispersed by the police). Some time later, the bloc turned into 
dust, its activists--apparently for good--disappeared from the 
political arena. Only Zhirinovskiy, who has honed his oratorical 
skills on a public rolling with laughter at his speeches, rose 
to the Olympus. 
  Over these years the "father of the nation's" arsenal of 
slogans expanded: It is now, "We will wash our boots in the 
Indian Ocean," and "We will close the oxygen valve to the near 
abroad," and as to further removed foreign countries--"stick it 
to them." Oh, all the things one can hear at rallies 
Zhirinovskiy holds every week in Sokolniki. 
  But the greater part of his initiatives Zhirinovskiy so far 
holds up his sleeve--"so that political rivals would not steal 
them." One such semifinished product designed to catch the State 
Duma dumbfounded--"the 'M'-right" (tentatively speaking, the 
"Master"). What is it? Each citizen of Russia ("if I am elected 
president") will receive a document attesting that the bearer is 
entitled to a share of every cubic meter of gas produced, each 
tonne of ore mined, and so on. For those who do not appreciate 
this right, their share will be cut--perhaps completely and for 
good.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Khinshteyn: "Zhirinovskiy's Honeymoon </F>
Tour"] 
  [Text] Since olden days, the Germans have been helping 
Russian oppositionists, from the Bolsheviks to General Vlasov. 
This lot has also befallen the victorious Vladimir Volfovich. 
  Drunk with a comparatively easy victory (neither he nor his 
Parteigenossen [party comrades] had expected this kind of 
triumph), the Liberal-Democrat set out on a honeymoon tour of 
Germany, which lies so close to his heart. Yet another trip of 
his was organized by Gerhard Frey, the leader of the German 
People's Union, who is known for his extreme right convictions 
and a friendship of long duration with Zh. 
  Unlike government delegations, the number of participants in 
the visit was relatively small--the leader, two bodyguards, and 
several party colleagues. However, the reception the leader got 
from like-minded people was not marked by such modesty. As on 
all his visits, Vladimir Volfovich stayed only in the luxury 
suites of five-star hotels, with appropriate fare. 
  The enraptured German patriots enthusiastically asked him 
for 
his autograph; statements by the Russian fuehrer (meaning 
leader) about the "Anschluss"--the annexation of Austria and 
Slovenia to Germany and the arrival of the Aryans on the shores 
of the Adriatic Sea were very much to their liking. In one city 
they even carried V.V. on the German flag to the sound of 
applause. To be sure, it was unknown whether there was a 
swastika on the flag, but if there was, the Liberal-Democrat 
shielded it with his body. 
  Newspapers were full of articles about the life of the "new 
Russian leader." Even materials from party organs such as SOKOLY 
ZHIRINOVSKOGO were being constantly reprinted. Citizens 
attended, with tremendous pleasure, paid press conferences: The 
enterprising Zh. charged credulous philistines admission in 
order improve his financial standing, which had been greatly 
shaken after electoral clashes. 
  As far as a ban on entering Germany for the Russian 
National-Socialist, he was not particularly concerned about it. 
Not long ago V.V. called his headquarters, announced that was 
doing just fine, and asked how things were going in Moscow. 
  He was right to ask. In the opinion of Sergey Zharikov, 
editor in chief of SOKOL ZHIRINOVSKOGO, and many other party 
members, LDP [Liberal-Democratic Party] functionaries had sent 
the leader on the tour specifically in order to resolve certain 
issues behind his back: to expand the LDP staff and fill it with 
their own people. In the words of "incorruptible fighters," a 
number of the most prominent figures of the party are confirmed 
communists who very much dislike the fact that the anticommunist 
Zhirinovskiy wields absolute power. And they badly want to throw 
their own weight around. This is precisely why human multitudes 
are now streaming into the LDP. Many businessmen drive right up 
in foreign-made cars, with their sable-clad wives, to sign up as 
Liberal-Democrats. The headquarters is beginning to look like 
the Smolnyy Institution in October [1917]. 
  However, Zhirinovskiy is either unafraid of the fifth column 
or does not take it seriously, or puts his faith in the magic 
powers of a red jacket cut from an enchanted Tibetan fabric 
which he has taken along. After the German tour he went, without 
going home, to Austria--independent for now--and after that, 
according to preliminary information, to Switzerland, to the 
local Liberal-Democrats. 
  Let us hope that he will not come back from Lenin's 
Switzerland in an impounded railway car.

<H5>  [No 4, Jan pp 10-13] </H5>
  [Text] Politics has returned to business as usual. 
Again it is dictated by the military-industrial complex. 
  The retirement of Yegor Gaydar and Ella Pamfilova and then 
the announcement of Boris Fedorov's retirement brought an end to 
the alignment of forces in the country and in the power 
structures that had lasted approximately since May 1992. The 
period of doubt was in the past: Before that it had still seemed 
to me, as, probably, to many others as well, that even after the 
December elections the harmful Gaydar reforms would be continued 
in Russia. Harmful because they were inadequate, half-measures; 
although they were needed they were merely monetaristic, 
anti-inflationary, and not structural and not economic reforms. 
Now it is clear--we will not even have the harmful ones. 
  Under the guise of social policy, in the name of the 
well-being of all the people, a planned economy with 
apportionment will be restored. Its rulers will be Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Oleg Soskovets, Aleksandr Zaveryukha and....Yuriy 
Skokov. And the president? He has now become a figurehead. Does 
he have an understanding attitude toward the first deputy prime 
minister's decision to resign? That is, an understanding that 
there will be no radical economic reforms. But, after all, the 
president's job is to guarantee structural transformations. And 
if it turns out that you cannot, well, be belle of the ball, 
there will be others, and your lot is to become a decoration. 
  And Gaydar will not be able to console us by saying that he 
does not intend to join the president's opposition, that Kozyrev 
will learn to outsing Zhirinovskiy, or that the West will repeat 
that Yeltsin still means democracy, and with all this Russia, 
instead of moving along the axis of time, will again revolve in 
the Chaadayev circle, in which there will be more Augusts and 
more Octobers. 
  Why is all this so? I am trying to find an answer to this 
question. 
<H5>  Grachev's Times </H5>
  In light of recent events, it is becoming increasingly 
apparent that in October 1993 the military actually took the 
upper hand. In this case I mean by military not only generals 
and colonels and not even the Army as such, but the entire 
military-industrial complex in alliance with the bureaucracy, 
although this includes the Army too, of course. 
  Of course this has been interpreted differently--as a 
victory 
for democracy, as the elimination of obstacles on the path to 
reform. 
  Recent actions of Yeltsin and the government confirm that 
the 
military, having lost a certain amount of power during 
Gorbachev's times, have not only regained it but have acquired 
even more influence over our lives than they had before. 
  Let us begin with a symbolic episode--in Russia's history it 
has frequently been the case that in order to understand what 
was going on, the symbol almost carries more weight than that 
which it designates. 
  A couple of days before the October events, Yeltsin called 
all the powerful ministers to a meeting. When Grachev came in 
late, Yeltsin pointed at his watch (many people saw this scene 
on television) and in response Grachev pointed at his, as if to 
say: "No, my watch is more accurate than yours." That seemed to 
be the end of the incident. What is important, however, is not 
whose watch was more accurate but the very fact that the 
military minister showed up at a meeting after the president 
had, and he did it intentionally: He knew that all the 
television channels of Russia and the world would broadcast this 
event. 
  This occurred two days before 3 October, and the country's 
leaders, journalists, and even military units already knew 
something about the imminent events. Suffice it to recall 
Yeltsin's route: the Taman Division, then the division imeni 
Dzerzhinskiy. Rutskoy had probably done something too. There had 
been conferences and negotiations. In the situation that had 
developed the meeting acquired truly symbolic importance--at 
that very moment Grachev placed himself in a special position. 
  But why was it that Yeltsin met with Grachev at 0400 hours 
on 
4 October and that this meeting took place in the Ministry of 
Defense and not in the president's residence? 
  And, finally: Why was it that on 3 October the authorities 
did not stop the thug-demonstrators from moving toward October 
Square, the building of the Supreme Soviet, and the television 
center? 
  As cochairmen of the Democratic Russia movement, I 
participated directly in the organization of the movement 
through Moscow of demonstrations involving approximately 400,000 
people. On the eve of one of them, in March 1990, Luzhkov, 
Murashev, and I were called in by Yanayev, Pugo, and Kryuchkov. 
There was a discussion about the possible consequences of 
gathering together such an immense mass of people and moving 
them through the streets of Moscow. At first they tried to 
persuade us to call off the procession and rally, threatening 
that we would be held personally responsible for the 
consequences. We said that we were prepared to take full 
responsibility, but under the condition that the events would 
develop according to our scenario, that is, according to the 
procedure for holding demonstrations approved in Moscow. If it 
were not violated, there would be no excesses. The route for the 
demonstration was agreed upon, and Ministry of Internal Affairs 
forces were provided for it: All side streets adjoining Sadovoye 
Circle were blocked by trucks loaded with sand and vehicles with 
water cannons, and there were cordons of soldiers. All the 
streets leading to the center were cut off. Under these 
conditions, the slightest deviation from the earmarked route was 
quite an impossible task. Nothing of the kind was envisioned on 
those October days in Moscow, although the technical 
capabilities for this, of course, existed. 
  Even after Rutskoy and then Makashov as well called for 
storming the television center, no measures were taken, and this 
enabled the commandos not only to reach their goal but also to 
begin the attack. 
  Why? It is possible to formulate two hypotheses. 
  The first: Those who wanted to but could not block the 
movement of the commandos did not have realistic forces. They 
did not have the subdivisions necessary to prevent this, and all 
appeals on the part of the authorities to the power structures 
were futile. Television and radio inflamed the situation: The 
troops are advancing on Moscow, they have already entered 
Moscow, they are moving toward the center, when in fact there 
were no troops at all. And they did not arrive until the morning 
of 4 October. Could it be that the military were twisting 
Yeltsin's arm and forcing him to accept certain of their 
conditions? 
  The second version is that the authorities themselves 
provoked this particular development of events and no other: 
They let the commandos through to the Supreme Soviet and gave 
them the opportunity to storm the mayor's office and Ostankino 
(the more so since the seizure of Ostankino did not make any 
difference anyway: It was possible to cut off broadcasting in a 
moment). Therefore, let everything develop according the "their" 
scenario: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov would show their putschist 
nature, the public would see that there was nowhere to turn, and 
everyone would breathe a sigh of relief and say: "Thank you, 
God, for putting an end to this parliament." 
  Both of these versions are quite possible. But, judging from 
subsequent events, the former seems more probable. 
  Literally the next day after the October events, Yeltsin 
convened the Security Council of Russia, where he raised only 
one question: about the new military doctrine. And this was done 
immediately after the events, before the fires had been put out, 
before the dead had been buried, as if throughout all of Russia, 
throughout the whole world, there were no problems that were 
more important. 
  In the new military doctrine it is necessary to single out 
two basic provisions: recognition of the extension of Russia's 
interests to the entire territory of the former USSR (with 
exceptions regarding the Baltic republics) and Russia's right to 
make the first nuclear strike. 
  How will these new provisions turn out for Russia and the 
rest of the world, and will they not damage the arms restriction 
and the international stability that have been observed recently? 
  Yeltsin's statements about the reduction of arms by 
two-thirds, made during the first days of his presidency, have 
not been repeated recently. Instead there are photographs of the 
commander-in-chief with a machine gun in his hands and his 
assurances: No more concessions to the West. And the military 
order for this year will be at last year's level. This order is 
being filled today by more than 2,000 enterprises and 660 
scientific institutes. Not a single new conversion program will 
be financed in 1994. 
  To this one might add Russia's blocking of attempts by 
countries of Eastern and Central Europe to join NATO. I shall 
give one more symbolic example. During Yeltsin's official visit 
to Warsaw, he had a conversation with the president of Poland. 
To Lech Walesca's question as to whether or not Poland is a 
sovereign state and is, accordingly, eligible to join NATO, 
Yeltsin gave a positive response. Grachev, who was standing 
nearby, tried to intervene and correct the president, to which 
Yeltsin quite fairly remarked to him: "Who is president of 
Russia, you or I?" But after returning to Moscow, Yeltsin 
apparently received certain clarifications and took a negative 
position regarding this question, which had a harsh resonance 
during his visit to Brussels. 
  Thus, the Army is already exerting an influence on foreign 
policy as well. 
  The scale of military control has reached alarming 
dimensions. On 19 January there was a session of the Security 
Council of the Russian Federation at which they considered 
military-technical (and, consequently, also financial?) problems 
of the new doctrine. Boris Fedorov was not allowed to attend 
this meeting. The country has no budget, the Government of 
Russia has not been formed, but the demands of the military are 
already being discussed. 
<H5>  Trench Thinking </H5>
  Through the efforts of the powerful party-state machine, 
which mobilized all means of influencing the minds and feelings 
of the people--the schools, literature, the press, art, science, 
institutions, institutes, organizations, punitive organs, the 
Army--three or four generations of Soviet people were duped 
every day, one and all. And this was not without results. How 
many people believed that they had achieved happiness on this 
earth, how many of them prayed for Stalin while sitting in 
prison camps? Some people even today believe that Hitler 
attacked the Soviet Union suddenly. 
  As a result, a large part of the society today is still 
psychologically in a condition if not of war, then in any case 
of defense from the surrounding world. Many Russians, even those 
who have never fought, are still sitting in the trenches 
ideologically. A kind of "trench" thinking, which pervades our 
society from bottom to top, is exerting an immense influence on 
the country's life today. 
  I am convinced that we must get over this condition. Until 
in 
Russia there are monuments, for example, to the German, Italian, 
French, and Romanian soldiers who died here during the war, and 
flowers are placed on them, we will not get well as a nation. 
  The victory of the military is closely interwoven with the 
foreign political course of the authorities. The provisions of 
the military doctrine to the effect that Russia's interests 
extend to all the territory of the former USSR and the attempts 
to impose a particular foreign policy on all countries of the 
former European "socialist camp" again place millions of people 
in a difficult position--after all, they believed that they had 
escaped Moscow's control forever. 
  Many have openly advanced the great-power ideology as one of 
the constituent parts of the official state policy. 
  The present foreign political strategy of the authorities 
can 
lead (and already is leading) to severe consequences. Up until 
quite recently, Russia has been waging or is waging an 
undeclared war at many points of the former USSR which might be 
called imperialist. 
  The largest problems lie in the nearby foreign countries, in 
the attitude of Russian authorities to the former Soviet 
republics. Externally, events are developing differently 
everywhere, but at the bottom of the problem there always lies 
something specific and, as a rule, concealed--Russia's interest 
in retaining the Black Sea coast, the large uranium mine in 
Tajikistan, enterprises of the military-industrial complex that 
are scattered everywhere, such, for example, as the aircraft 
plant in Tbilisi or defense enterprises of the Dniester region. 
But if it were only that. 
<H5>  By Hook or By Crook </H5>
  There is a more and more overt desire to subordinate the 
former Soviet republics, to assign to them the role that was 
previously played by countries of the "socialist camp": to be a 
buffer zone between Russia and distant foreign countries. 
  The civilized divorce did not take place: Disputes arose out 
of the Black Sea fleet and the Crimea, out of nuclear weapons 
and space objects. There was the desire, even at gigantic costs, 
to use economic measures to force the former republics to enter 
the CIS. But, as distinct from the USSR, we did not want to take 
any responsibility for what was going on there: neither for the 
carnage in Georgia nor the famine in Armenia. 
  In order to understand the fundamentals of the "new" policy, 
it is necessary to answer this question: According to which 
indicators does the Russian Federation today determine which 
former Soviet republics to support and which not to? 
  In places where attempts are made to show independence and 
get out of control, Russia supports "national liberation" 
movements under the pretext of protecting the Russian-speaking 
population. Sometimes the direct participation of Russian forces 
is camouflaged and presented to the whole world as a 
peace-making mission in interethnic conflicts. One can see a 
clear unwillingness to take the remaining divisions back to 
Russia. The nearby foreign countries are the source of the main 
threat to Russia's vital interests, as Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of the Russian Federation A. Kozyrev said at a 
conference of Russian ambassadors in the CIS and Baltic 
countries. In the minister's opinion, Russia should continue her 
military presence in the countries of the Commonwealth. 
  Imperialist intentions are being manifested in many ways. We 
supported the structures of the Dniester Republic created 
through the efforts of Lukyanov as well as allied power 
structures in order to take the Moldovans in hand. In September 
1993 there was a military parade of the armed forces of the 
Dniester region, which was shown on television. Who was 
financing the Dniester region during the military events, and 
who is financing it today? We know only that it was not Moldova, 
of which the Dniester region is a part: The Dniester authorities 
rejected Moldova's "services" during the conflict. Does this 
mean that Russia was financing them secretly? Directly, out of 
the budget or with "credits" of the Central Bank of Russia? 
Under what items are the payments made? Or are the authorities 
especially financing certain Russian enterprises, which then 
send money to Tiraspol? Is the Central Bank of Russia taking 
part in this? Does Gerashchenko know about this, and is he not 
the one who transferred the CPSU money abroad at one time? I do 
not think I am the only one interested in the answers to these 
questions. 
  There is a similar situation in the Caucasus as well. Russia 
has actually been engaged in a war against Georgia, but the 
authorities have denied this or tried to speak with society in 
some kind of strange language. If one compares tiny Abkhazia, 
which is a part of Georgia, for example, with Tambov Oblast, the 
question arises: Where could the Tambov governor have gotten 
Su-27's, MiG-29's, modern tanks, and thousands of automatic 
Kalashnikovs? Where did Abkhazia get such a quantity of 
aircraft, tanks, and artillery? With the help of which forces 
did Abkhazia conduct large-scale military operations? Who 
financed the deliveries and the maintenance of the Abkhazian 
army and hundreds of volunteers from Russia? 
  I do not want to accuse the authorities of Russia of first 
being on Abkhazia's side and then on the other side. We know how 
this war began. Shevardnadze is to blame, Ardzinba is to blame, 
and it is difficult to say right now which of them is more to 
blame. But clarifying for the society the question of Russia's 
role in this war is not the main thing. Should they have 
supported the Abkhaz against the "entrenched" Georgia in their 
desire for independence and self-sufficiency? They did support 
them. And the Abkhaz "liberated" their entire territory, but 
with the help of Russian troops and technical equipment. Have 
things gone too far? Wrath was replaced with kindness, 
Shevardnadze was supported and forced to enter the CIS. Why? 
  The Azerbaijan-Armenian conflict, of course, had plenty of 
causes of its own, but Russia's role there was not beyond 
reproach either. 
  There are many vague words about strategic objectives, but 
there are no official, exhaustive statements from the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, the government, or the president regarding 
this. Strategy must be comprehensible so that the society can at 
least determine its attitude toward it. If we say that democracy 
means an open society, Russia's interests must be known. They 
must not be concealed as they were before. 
  But the most alarming situation today is developing in 
Central Asia. Here, as before, Russia is in a state of 
undeclared war, a war with unstated objectives. Russia is making 
war in Tajikistan on the side of the puppet pro-Uzbek regime, a 
reactionary regime that is mercilessly suppressing the very 
principles of free thought and democracy in Tajikistan. People 
calling for democratic transformations are now being forced to 
live outside Tajikistan, actually in emigration, in Russia, 
India, and other countries. And now, along with this puppet 
regime, the Russian authorities are taking advantage of the 
residuals of the Tajik opposition, the residuals of the 
democratic forces. Kozyrev is going to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan 
in order to persuade the Kyrgyz and Kazakhs to enter this 
conflict on Russia's side so that Russia will not be fighting 
alone here but to take cover under the flags of several 
countries, as during the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia 
in 1968. 
  There is probably a hope of restoring the empire lying here 
too. It is one thing when communists at rallies demand the 
restoration of the USSR, and something altogether different when 
it is the official position and actual policy of the authorities. 
  Our present leaders have apparently not learned anything 
from 
the experience of 10 years of war in Afghanistan. The Soviet 
empire collapsed because it was impossible to maintain such a 
large number of territories at its own expense, and attempts to 
reinvigorate this policy are doomed in advance to failure. 
<H5>  [No 5, Feb pp 18-20] </H5>
  [Text] At moments of crisis, Russia has always chosen 
the road of traditionalism, abandoning attempts to become a 
modern society. 
  Economy in the Western sense of this word, namely a system 
based on natural and harmonious development of various elements 
(agriculture and industry, the state and private sectors, 
civilian and military production) never existed even in 
prerevolutionary Russia. One can discuss the Russian economy 
more as an extremely premodern system in which the requirements 
of social control prevailed over strictly economic 
considerations (one need recall only the ups and downs of 
liberating the serfs), which created obstacles to the 
establishment of a new structure for the society. From the very 
beginning of the changes (the age of Peter the Great) an 
artificial construct, one that was not capable of 
self-advancement, was created. 
  All of these structural peculiarities were not surmounted in 
1917 but, on the contrary, they became stronger. The lack of 
balance among various constituent parts of the economy 
increased. Relations among subjects of the national economic 
complex, instead of being natural, were imposed by political 
will, which gave little consideration to the elementary norms of 
the functioning of the economic system. 
<H5>  The Socialist Fish </H5>
  Unfortunately, today the gigantic supermonopoly of the state 
actually determines the picture of gross national production as 
much as ever. The central planning and distribution organs have 
changed their names but not their functions. The ministries and 
departments have changed their stripes and become branch holding 
companies and concerns, squashing almost all attempts at 
competition. The Central Bank has taken over many distribution 
functions. It engages in the distribution of finances at the 
federal level, and this is practically the same thing as 
distribution of resources and planning of physical volumes of 
production. At the regional level, distribution functions are 
performed by the local nomenklatura. And that is the main work 
of the administration as a whole in the krays, oblasts, 
republics, and in Moscow, including the most lucrative trade in 
the bureaucratic business--quotas on export deliveries. 
  The extremely severe pressure from the "Soviet" economic 
leaders has nullified the economic changes made at the beginning 
of 1992 by the Gaydar government. They are returning to the 
so-called planned, cost-oriented economy. 
  I will give an absurd but typical example from which it is 
possible to draw certain conclusions. E. Chernyy, chairman of 
the presidium of the Union of Independent Fish Industry Workers, 
wrote in IZVESTIYA about the fact that the former Ministry of 
the Fish Industry (now the Committee on Fishing of the Russian 
Federation) submitted to the government a regular "plan of the 
century." Instead of demonopolizing the branch and placing fish 
processing enterprises and ships in private hands (which, 
incidentally, requires no subsidies) and creating a multitude of 
competing fishing and fish processing enterprises, the committee 
suggests giving itself a monopoly on everything related to 
fishing in Russia. Moreover, it requests from the state 4 
trillion rubles [R] (three-fourths of which are to be in 
dollars), material resources worth R700 billion and exemption 
from taxes, and customs fees and duties. The production cost of 
fish would be 10 times higher than the world price. The 
"effectiveness" of the branch, of course, would be socialist as 
before: While catching as many fish as Japan does, we maintained 
a fleet that was 6 (six!) times larger than Japan's in terms of 
tonnage. 
  If one takes into account the fact that in addition to the 
Committee on Fishing we have about 400 branch 
department-monopolies and there is not a single one of them that 
does not require subsidies, and the total revenue side of 
Russia's budget is only R22 trillion, one can understand that to 
preserve the branch ministries and meet their demands will lead 
Russia to hyperinflation and the collapse of the national 
economy. 
  On the initiative of the branch monopolists, the authorities 
will introduce new duties on foodstuffs and industrial goods. 
These measures will help neither Russian industry nor 
agriculture nor the consumer. They will merely eliminate 
competitors, expand the field for raising prices, and create 
cozy conditions for the talentless leaders of the monopolies: 
They will not have to be concerned about reducing production 
costs, modernizing production, changing over to new models, and 
so forth. 
  Predominant in banking are pseudo-commercial banks that 
almost do not depend on deposits from the population or 
enterprises: They are still redistributing the same state 
finances. Among them there are still branch banks which 
monopolize each branch even more. The fear of competition has 
led to banning the activity of foreign banks. 
  The example of the sale of gas is very typical: Ukraine is 
curtailing deliveries under the pretext that it is because of 
delayed payments, but at the same time they offer gas to Serbia, 
even though it would be quite unrealistic to expect payments 
from it--inflation there runs into the hundreds of thousands of 
percentage points. Again the economy is under the influence of 
politics. 
  One can always hear complaints about inflation and excessive 
taxes, but literally all critics--from communists to "radical" 
democrats--remain completely silent about the causes: 
expenditures on the Army, the military-industrial complex, the 
kolkhozes, and factories that are operated at a loss which are 
on the shoulders of the Russian taxpayer. If every fifth 
able-bodied person in the country is sitting in a tank or 
working on manufacturing one, what kind of economic upturn can 
there be? They remain silent, probably, because now it is 
dangerous to mention the military-industrial complex and the 
Army. This is another effect of the psychological victory of the 
military. 
  Privatization, initiative to create different nonstate forms 
of ownership, competition and the free market, convertibility of 
the ruble, open foreign economic activity (including openness 
for Western investments), the establishment of real commercial 
banks, reduction of state costs, the beginning of a new tax 
policy, social protection--this is a selection of measures that 
must be implemented in order to escape from the old type of 
economy and reach a new one. 
  We need not to reduce ministry staffs, but to achieve 
complete elimination of all branch monopolies, beginning with 
Agroprom [Agro-industrial Complex] and the Ministry of Trade. 
During the transition period, the ministers must appoint only 
those who are capable of conducting legally intelligent 
self-elimination of the ministry and creating a competitive 
environment in their branch. But, as we see, events are 
developing in exactly the opposite direction. 
<H5>  The Countryside--Eternal Pain and Hindrance </H5>
  The stumbling block of previous and current Russian 
reformers 
has been agrarian relations. 
  The most impoverished situation exists in agriculture today. 
But not because of the shortage of technical equipment, fuel, or 
money, but because of new relations among the producer, 
consumer, and intermediary (state) that have developed recently. 
  An ugly symbiosis has developed between the peasant and the 
kolkhoz, or, rather, the kolkhoz worker and the kolkhoz. They 
are all sucking off one another like parasites. The kolkhoz 
workers for better or worse have finally received large 
farmstead plots where they raise the things that are most 
necessary for their families (this is also partially commercial 
production as well). And one can only rejoice at that. 
  But the peasant has been placed in conditions whereby he 
needs the kolkhoz like the air he breathes since there (and only 
there) is the possibility of stealing grain to feed his cattle, 
and for a bottle of vodka he can use the equipment to cultivate 
his plot. Additionally, the kolkhoz is for the peasant a kind of 
guarantee against unforeseen circumstances. 
  The kolkhoz cannot get along without the peasant either: The 
fields must be planted, at least some of the crops must be 
harvested, and it is necessary to render an accounting for 
ruined credit, subsidies, and technical equipment. 
  This parasitic symbiosis created by that gigantic monopoly, 
Agroprom, is also the main social impediment to the development 
of agrarian production in Russia, the introduction of the 
institution of private ownership of the land, and the formation 
of farmer-run or voluntary collective farms. Up to this point in 
Russia's agriculture, there have been practically no 
commodity-monetary relations: Instead of buying and selling 
products, the kolkhoz workers "turn them over," and in exchange 
they "receive" something. 
  The powerful agrarian lobby in the new Duma and government 
will continue to demand incredible subsidies from the state. The 
agrarian nomenklatura has always referred to Western practice, 
where in fact many states grant subsidies to agriculture. But, 
as before, the experts on the kolkhoz system say nothing about 
the immense differences in political, economic, and even 
technological conditions between Russia and the Western 
countries: The Western countries subsidize each farmer 
individually, providing additional payment for the crop that has 
been raised or for reducing the planted areas. We have 
everything upside down: The subsidies are received not by the 
kolkhoz worker and not by the farmer, but by Agroprom--a 
structure that has no analogues in any developed country. 
  A truly democratic power must think about how to get out of 
the economy, leaving the state only indirect instruments of 
regulation--tax, credit-financial, excise, and customs. 
  Unfortunately, all this tells us that the powerful economic 
structures are still active, and they are the ones that 
determine the political and economic life of modern Russia. 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy--A Mirror of Russian Society </H5>
  I do not see anything surprising or unexpected in 
Zhirinovskiy's victory in the elections. The simplest thing to 
say is that communists and fascists voted for him, but the real 
causes of this result go much deeper. 
  For centuries the absence of a social space outside the 
limits of "state interests" was compensated for in Russia by 
other realities--boorishness and tyranny. On the one hand there 
was arbitrariness, complete lawlessness, and violence, and on 
the other--obsequiousness, tractability, servility, and 
powerlessness. 
  The main things that made it impossible for the people of 
Russia to break out of the totalitarian system--whether it be 
before or after 1917--was the unformed nature of the civilian 
society in Russia, the state monopoly over any action that had 
been established here, and the absence of any kind of socium at 
all beyond the all-pervasive state. The vicious circle outlined 
even by Chernyshevskiy, the "almighty state--subjects deprived 
of initiative," guaranteed the system's constant 
self-perpetuation. Even the reforms did not break the circle but 
merely modernized the system in order to preserve and strengthen 
the regime. 
  With respect to the spiritual sphere, socialist 
experimentation led to a redoubling of the lack of freedom. The 
social consciousness of prerevolutionary Russia was mainly 
traditionalist and mythological. Irrational (heathen and 
orthodox) ideas, symbols, and ideals prevailed in it. It is also 
possible to discuss the lack of freedom here in the sense that 
the people lived and acted guided mainly not by reason but by 
prejudices. Their freedom was fettered by a system of all kinds 
of mental restrictions and habits. 
  After 1917 it was as though an additional lack of freedom 
was 
superimposed on top of this lack of freedom--also in the form of 
a framework or system of restrictive principles, but this time 
Marxist-Leninist ones that were supposed to be rationalistic. 
The redoubled lack of freedom is the most appreciable result of 
totalitarianism in the spiritual life of modern Russia. It is 
the main reason for the distorted perception of the world as 
well as for the fact that Russia has not yet found an identity. 
  Zhirinovskiy's victory is mainly the non-success of 
Yeltsin's 
reforms and, on the other hand, a quality of Russian society, a 
condition of its mentality. The results of the elections were 
only a mirror in which Russians had to look in order to see 
themselves. 
  I am not inclined to dramatize Zhirinovskiy's success and 
see 
it almost as the onset of the brown plague. It is dangerous, of 
course, but not so much as to make a tragedy of it. And for the 
authorities it is a kind of lottery win. When something did not 
go right in Gorbachev's age, it took Ligachev to present it as 
the embodiment of reaction and the cause of failure. If Ligachev 
had not done it, Gorbachev would have played this role himself. 
If Gorbachev had not done it, then the Supreme Soviet of Russia 
would have appeared immediately: It turns out that all the 
difficulties lie in conservatism and the reactionary nature of 
the communist deputies and Khasbulatov-Rutskoy. If they had not 
been there, it would have been necessary to replace them, and 
perhaps Zhirinovskiy can do this: For the near future he will do 
as someone else to blame for the failures of reform. 
  When they say that Stalin destroyed the people, one must 
remember that the Stalinist regime was also made up of the same 
people who were parties to the crimes of this regime. It is 
impossible to draw a line, to say these are the victims and 
these are the hangmen. There is both a hangman and a victim in 
each of us. When an understanding of this reaches people, when 
we stop pointing at Gaydar or Zhirinovskiy, when we want to 
really see the difficulties of our life, only then will we enter 
on a normal path. But for now, give us the next person to blame. 
<H5>  The Essence and Form of the New Regime </H5>
  The process of renewal is taking place extremely slowly, and 
Russia's current condition can be characterized by a proverb: "I 
would like to go to heaven, but my sins keep me out." That which 
until recently kept us in a premodern condition continues to be 
a reality even today. At crisis moments in history, Russia has 
always chosen the path of traditionalism, abandoning attempts to 
become a modern society. Today we are again faced with a choice: 
And again we are trying to overcome traditionalism, archaism, 
and collectivism, which were excellently preserved during the 
Soviet period. 
  In the summer of 1992, one can pinpoint the beginning of the 
departure from the course toward liberal reforms, toward 
resolute and specific advancement. At that time, Gaydar began to 
pursue an anti-Gaydar course. At the same time Yeltsin and the 
government were experiencing stronger and stronger pressure from 
the military-industrial complex, the Army, the Russian 
bureaucracy, and the agro-industrial nomenklatura, including 
kolkhoz chairmen and sovkhoz directors. 
  Today there is practically nothing left of reformism except 
rhetoric. Politics has become duplicitous, hidden, and 
frequently dishonest. Last year was a year of decline of the 
reformist course which Gaydar brought with him. The result of 
this policy is an increase in the distance between the 
authorities and society, the loss of social reference points, 
predatory, unconcealed enrichment of the nomenklatura through 
"converting" power and connections into wealth, and ultimately 
loss for Zhirinovskiy. 
  The essence of what will take place in Russia in the near 
future will be the strengthening of the dominance of the 
military-industrial complex in alliance with the neo-Soviet 
nomenklatura and deceived democratic forces. 
  The form in which it will begin to be realized will be an 
authoritarian regime: Today headed by Yeltsin, tomorrow, 
possibly, by someone else. This is not the first time that 
reforms are being constrained not only by the will of those 
gathered in the government, but by those social forces that 
dominate in Russia. 
  Among them one can single out three main ones. 
  First, those employed in the military-industrial complex. 
Most of them have nothing to gain from a market economy. The 
second force is our kolkhoz peasantry, most of whom are 
depraved, having become accustomed to a parasitic way of life, 
theft, and poor work, supported by the agricultural 
nomenklatura. Third, the bureaucracy: 20 million bureaucrats, 
almost all of them corrupt, who have seen an additional 
possibility of taking bribes and are the basis of the shadow 
economy. 
  All three forces are against the market, against democracy, 
against getting rid of the poverty we are experiencing. 
  It has been said that parliament has become the embodiment 
of 
forces of reaction, communist forces, an impediment to further 
reforms of which it was necessary to rid ourselves in order to 
reform Russia. And Yeltsin supposedly meant democracy, and 
victory over parliament was a triumph of democracy. One cannot 
say that these judgments were completely wrong. In the Supreme 
Soviet there was indeed much more conservatism with respect to 
reforms than in the structures of executive power, but the 
essence lies elsewhere. By Yeltsin's time a new class of 
neo-Soviet nomenklatura had formed in Russia. This class was 
represented by both branches of power: both the executive and 
the legislative. 
  In and of itself the name "authoritarian regime" tells us 
little: It could be reformist, enlightened, and aimed at 
progress. The present authoritarian regime has no justification 
for calling itself either reformist or progressive or 
democratic. This is an authoritarian regime which expresses the 
interests of the monopolistic and militarized economy of Russia, 
reinforced by imperialist ambitions. 
  Regarding what occurred in Russia during those October days 
of 1917, Osip Mandelshtam found a capacious expression--"noise 
of the times." He defined everything that was going on in Russia 
at the time as noise, not yet very clearly expressed and still 
difficult to distinguish, but powerful, disturbing, and 
frightening. 
  And here again is the "noise of the times" which is reaching 
the entire world. What will it evoke this time? Need we have 
fear about the future? How will the Eastern winds affect the 
entire world this time?

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Rinayeva, with military-political analysis </F>
by Arkadiy Moshes and Dmitriy Danilov: "The Last Thrust to the 
South Might Really Be the Last for Russia--If Zhirinovskiy 
Becomes President"] 
  [Text] The legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin is 
very frightening. He was offended and in order to get revenge he 
lured all of the children out of the city by playing his pipe. 
Nobody ever heard from them again. I think the rat catcher 
simply killed them. He led them into a swamp. They, the poor 
things, saw that there was a quagmire underfoot and they were 
squelching through it but still they walked--listening to the 
pipe.... 
  Oh if only they had believed their own wet socks rather 
than the sweet grace notes! 
  Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy is a brilliant rat 
catcher of our time. His pipe is big and loud. When hearing it a 
person does not want to look under his feet. Force 
yourself--look. Through Vladimir Volfovich's book, "The Last 
Thrust To the South." 
<H5>  How To Save the Russian Nation </H5>
  "There absolutely must be a war with the Turks. They 
killed my uncle!" (Schweik). 
  Foreign policy, as we know, is Mr. Zhirinovskiy's favorite 
subject. The theme of foreign policy runs through his book as a 
leitmotif. 
  "I have already begun to develop my own geopolitical 
concept," writes Vladimir Volfovich. "I do not want to give it a 
name like, say, the Zhirinovskiy formula, but the last "Thrust" 
to the south, Russia's approach to the shores of the Indian 
Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea--these are indeed tasks for the 
salvation of the Russian nation...this solves all the problems 
at once." 
  Deciphering the idea of the "Last Thrust": Russia must again 
include within its borders not only the former republics of the 
Transcaucasus and Tajikistan, but also--the main 
thing!--Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. 
  Vladimir Volfovich explains: All the great powers have 
spheres of influence, which only bolsters their world prestige: 
the United States--Latin America, France--North Africa...our 
southern neighbors must become this kind of "soft underbelly" 
for us. 
  The advantages, in Mr. Zhirinovskiy's opinion, are obvious. 
In the first place, he asserts, we would eliminate the threat to 
Russia from the south: Afghanistan is already sending armed 
detachments to Tajikistan and Ankara is already dreaming of a 
Turkish state that has swallowed up Azerbaijan, the Northern 
Caucasus, and Georgia. Our borders would become peaceful, and 
there would be stability in the south. Moreover, a slight 
rearrangement of the Near East "would also prevent a third 
world war." 
  Then the Thrust would strengthen the legs of the Russian 
army, which were about to give out. "The new armed forces 
will be able to recuperate only through combat operations," 
-- notes Zhirinovskiy. 
  For Vladimir Volfovich the movement southward is as simple 
as 
can be, natural and pleasant. Instead of "moving Russia 
into the tundra where there can only be mineral resources, where 
nothing can live and develop,"--forward in striped 
swimsuits to the Indian Ocean! After the Turkish textiles! 
  I can just imagine how on a dank, rainy evening Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy bit on his quill pen, shivered from the cold, and 
wrote: "How I dream about having Russian soldiers wash 
their boots in the warm water of the Indian Ocean and change 
into summer uniforms forever. Light shoes, light trousers, 
short-sleeved T-shirts, no ties, and open collars." And 
following--"recreation bases, youth camps, sanitoriums, 
preventive treatment facilities"... The Russian language 
and the Russian ruble would prevail, there would be no column 
for "nationality" in passports, and everyone would have human 
rights. God, a paradise! 
  It seems that so far people have gotten into paradise only 
after they are dead.... 
<H5>  How Is the Crow Like an Office Desk? </H5>
  "Do not be shy, boys! Right at your heels 
  Rolls a whole cartload of money, 
  Clop, clop, clop! 
  A whole cartload of money, a kitchen with farina, 
  Well, where is there a regiment happier than ours?" 
  (Schweik). 
  Let us take a look at the consistency of Vladimir 
Volfovich's 
ethical maxims. It reminds us very much of Bolvanshchik's 
riddle, to which the author himself did not know the answer: 
"How is a crow like an office desk?" 
  On the one hand, Zhirinovskiy dons the feathers of the dove 
of peace and takes the olive branch between his teeth. 
  "It is impossible to recognize democracy when it is 
bathed in blood" V.V. says quite correctly. "It is 
necessary to form in people's minds and create institutions of 
power so as to preclude obscurantism when a whole region is 
covered with blood." It is necessary "To preclude a 
situation whereby arms are used to solve all problems." "Do not 
kill. Do not steal. Do not deceive. Do not commit violence...all 
grandmothers and grandfathers of the world teach their 
grandchildren to do good," Vladimir Volfovich 
sentimentalizes. 
  Apparently they did not teach him. 
  There is an engraving of Durer's. It is shocking. Little Red 
Riding Hood and the wolf are lying under the same blanket. She 
is innocence itself and he is the essence of loathsomeness. They 
are lying there, however, peacefully. In the same bed. Just 
think: Is it possible for them to lie there, under the blanket, 
in one body? 
  In any case, Zhirinovskiy has two heads. We listen to the 
first one, the innocent one. We are also listening to the second 
one--in which the wolf's teeth are chattering. They are 
chattering a melody as old as the world: In general one must 
not, but I can, and only this one time. 
  "If we begin to block Afghanistan, Iran, and 
Turkey--possibly some of the residents of these countries will 
be dissatisfied. But the whole world should understand that 
since Russia has to do this, it is all right." Chatter! 
"Medicine is not always sweet. Perhaps somebody in Kabul, 
Tehran, or Ankara might not like it. But it will make things 
better for millions of people." Chatter! We have already 
heard these speeches somewhere before: Was it not for the good 
of our people that the best of them rotted away in camps? Was it 
not for the happiness of the German nation that the chambers of 
the furnaces we all know about never stopped burning? How many 
times have we weighed and weighed again a child's tear against 
the well-being of mankind, and all this is new to Vladimir 
Volfovich! 
  And the farther you go, the purer it is. "Nothing will 
happen to the world even if the Turkish nation does die out." 
"Some of the population (of the southern regions), 
unfortunately, will die because the South does not now have 
sufficient medicines or a sufficient level of culture. Therefore 
there will be a natural survival, assimilation, and adaptation. 
This is a natural process." 
  One can confidently replace "they will die" with "they will 
be destroyed": Perhaps it is impossible to build the path to the 
warm seas and oceans with an olive branch. An opponent of 
violence, Zhirinovskiy in his voluptuous descriptions of 
blue-eyed soldiers in the New South, emphasizes this detail: In 
their hands will be "a small modern Russian automatic 
produced by the Izhevsk Plant. These automatics are much better 
than Uzis. So any platoon of Russian soldiers could impose order 
in any space." Vladimir Volfovich sees "Russian 
commanders...marking out routes for movements of troop 
formations...aircraft...submarines that travel to the shores of 
the Indian Ocean, landing craft suitable for the shores to which 
soldiers of the Russian army are already marching...." 
  How is a crow like an office desk? What do nonviolence and 
the last Thrust to the south have in common? Answer, you crazy 
Bolvanshchik. 
<H5>  There Will Be No Paradise </H5>
  "Do you like Turks?- 
  Schweik asked 
  The tractor operator Palivets.-- 
  Those simple ones? But do you not?" 
  Let us turn to the facts and figures. Let them tell us: Is a 
Last Thrust to the South possible? Is it possible for us to swim 
in the Indian Ocean and vacation peacefully in Iranian 
sanitoriums? 
  There is only one answer: Alas, gentlemen, there will be no 
swimming paradise. One wise woman said: "The first night with a 
man means nothing. If he remains with you after the second--you 
have won!" 
  Zhirinovskiy forgets that if you go in the direction of the 
warmer regions you must not only set out for there--you must 
also keep them under control. 
  Yes, Vladimir Volfovich has learned well the main lesson of 
history, which is that it does not teach us anything. Why recall 
that immediately after the death of Alexander of Macedonia the 
empire he had created fell apart. That the Greeks, whose 
garrisons were based throughout an immense expanse--from Egypt 
to Central Asia--disappeared without a trace in the mass of the 
local population. That Napoleon's Egyptian adventure ended 
ingloriously. And after two bloody wars in Afghanistan the 
English were still unable to add even one diamond to the 
imperial throne. 
  During the golden days of the victorious tsarist army it 
took 
76 years to subdue the mountain peoples of the Caucasus. The 
penetration into Central Asia, which began under Peter I, did 
not end until 1884. And before the revolution the Cossacks 
resumed the war against the Tsarist troops while Bukhara 
remained a vassal of the state almost until the middle of the 
twenties.... 
  If today the Algerian Muslims are sowing bloody terror 
against nonfundamentalist foreigners, what will be the reaction 
of the Muslim world to an invasion by orthodox believers?! 
(Zhirinovskiy, incidentally, also hears "the ringing of 
the bells of the Russian Orthodox Church on the shore of the 
Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.") 
  No, there will be no paradise. And peace in the captured 
territories will be possible in only one way: with barbed wire, 
barracks, guard dogs, and mountains of corpses--both from one 
side and from the other.... 
  Now about the military actions themselves. Vladimir 
Volfovich 
allows as how we might be the first to be attacked. But experts 
say that at the present time there is no justification for 
saying that there is a Turkish (or "pan-Turkish") threat against 
Russia. Moreover, the secular nature of the modern Turkish state 
and its cautious policy in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia 
show an obvious unwillingness on Turkey's part to be drawn into 
even a slight resemblance of a military confrontation with 
Russia. 
  So we ourselves will have to attack. 
  Let us imagine the year 1996. Zhirinovskiy takes the 
presidential oath on the new Constitution. And he does 
everything he can to unleash war. 
  It is quite obvious that Russia will begin it in an 
exceptionally disadvantageous military-political situation. Our 
troops will be opposed by forces of Turkey and Iran, Afghan 
formations, and the army of Pakistan (taking into account its 
involvement in Afghan events and the fact that Zhirinovskiy is 
secretly counting on friendly behavior from India). 
  Invasion of Turkey, which is a member of NATO, will bring up 
the question of the adoption of countermeasures by all the rest 
of the states of the bloc and the rendering of military 
assistance to the anti-Russian coalition (provided that the 
offended parties organize it). Let us even say that the NATO 
countries will not move their divisions toward Russia's western 
borders. In any case the American, British, and French units now 
stationed in Turkey will be reinforced. 
  Vladimir Volfovich's reliance on an alliance with the Arab 
states is not justified. On the contrary, any "bow" to Saddam 
Husayn, whom Mr. Zhirinovskiy likes so much (his portrait hangs 
in the propaganda room of the staff headquarters of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia) will immediately restore the 
anti-Iraqi coalition of the times of the war in the Persian Gulf. 
  The knot of conflicts that is growing ever tighter in the 
Transcaucasus makes it impossible for either Zhirinovskiy or 
anybody else to look for strong allies there. Rather, drawing 
the peoples of the region into the orbit of large-scale military 
actions will bring about a war of everyone against everyone 
else, which is much more destructive and irrational than the one 
in Afghanistan. 
  It is clear that Vladimir Volfovich's "Thrust" will make the 
southern boundaries of Russia not a peaceful region but a 
gigantic cauldron of war in which we will have to fight alone 
against practically all the rest of the world. 
<H5>  Malbruk Made Ready for a Campaign... </H5>
  "During the summer, under the shade of the acacias, it 
is pleasant to dream about being posted." (Kozma Prutkov). 
  Can we hope for victory? Elementary arithmetic gives us the 
answer: We cannot. 
  Here are the military potentials of the sides. Just Turkey, 
Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan together have more than 2 
million enlisted men and officers, 8,600 basic combat tanks, 
7,300 armored vehicles, 12,500 guns and mortars, 1,700 combat 
airplanes, and 400 combat helicopters. In their actual trained 
reserves they have another 1.7 million people, not counting 
Afghanistan, where only babies do not carry weapons. 
  The military potential of the Arab part of the anti-Iraqi 
coalition and Israel amounts to another 900,000 people (with an 
equal number in reserve), 10,775 tanks, 16,000 armored vehicles, 
about 6,300 guns and mortars, and 2,000 combat airplanes and 
helicopters. 
  We are still not taking into account all the NATO forces and 
the armies of other European states, which are not likely to 
remain tolerant of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's pranks.... 
  But what about Russia? Russia, according to the calculations 
of the authors, realistically has in the North Caucasus Military 
District, the Transcaucasian Group of Forces, and the states of 
Central Asia...no more than 87,500 people, 1,700 tanks, 3,820 
armored vehicles, 2,050 guns and mortars, and up to 500 
aircraft--and most of them belong to air defense. Not very many? 
And even this equipment is subject to partial reduction--under 
the Agreement on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 
  No strategist could attack under these conditions, even a 
genius. Well, all right, let us say the units are transferred, 
the reservists are called up, and all the long-distance aircraft 
and forces of the Black Sea and Caspian fleets would make it 
possible to increase the figures that were given threefold, 
fivefold, or 10-fold. That would still be clearly inadequate. 
  A fresh example comes to mind. In order to overcome the 
resistance of the Iraqi grouping of 183,000 (not 2 or 3 
million!), members of the coalition had to concentrate 750,000 
people, 4,000 tanks, 3,700 rifles and mine throwers, 2,000 
airplanes, and more than 100 ships, including several shock 
aircraft carriers, in the region. And what forces would Russia 
have to put in motion? 
  People who are possessed frequently push right on through to 
the breaking point. Let us assume that Zhirinovskiy has decided 
to call up a million reservists, whose combat readiness is the 
subject for a separate discussion, and begins to concentrate 
forces. 
  Where? 
  --On the operationally narrow section between the Volga and 
the Don and along the border with Kazakhstan. After that it will 
also be necessary to get over the Caucasian Mountains, the 
Steppes, and the desert. 
  How? 
  --By the railroad, which cannot even take the flood of 
vacationers, by an air bridge, which would not have a sufficient 
number of airfields, or...under their own steam? 
  All right, good. Let us assume that we got there. But is it 
possible to attack on several fronts that are thousands of 
kilometers long in a theater of war with which the army is not 
familiar? How do we bring in ammunition, and reinforcements, how 
do we evacuate the wounded? It is easy to bomb railroads, and 
temporary airfields--even easier.... 
  What about communications and troop control? In modern 
warfare, especially in mountainous regions, their effectiveness 
depends largely on satellite systems. The troops of the 
anti-Iraqi coalition in 1991 utilized about 60 military 
satellites. We have a couple of dozen of them...etc., etc. 
  Finally, will Vladimir Volfovich, following the 
adventuristic 
logic of his Thrust, not have to dig into the cherished nuclear 
suitcase? To strike a blow to enemy cities, to destroy nuclear 
power plants, oil wells, irrigation systems? And receive a 
response--with nuclear weapons? Chemical? Bacteriological? And 
not only on the Russian army but also on its territory. The 
result: the destruction of the army, population, and the Russian 
State itself. 
  Let us imagine the Russian soldier who has reached the 
Indian 
Ocean. And is washing his boots in it. In warm water. Somewhere 
far away is the depopulated Russia with its ruined economy. 
Right behind his back is the scorched desert. Under his feet--a 
narrow strip of ocean shore. Ahead.... 
<H5>  The Role of Swimming Trunks in Geopolitics </H5>
  "Although we shame the Russian name, we serve only 
ourselves." (Kozma Prutkov). 
  A couple of days ago an argument about Zhirinovskiy broke 
out 
on the trolley. "He is only concerned about Russia!"--shouted an 
old woman. Oh, old woman, is he concerned! He is ready to drown 
in blood--that is true. To put some people in jail and others to 
shoot. Every device will be used. 
  It is strange--Vladimir Volfovich increasingly reminds me of 
Fat Vaska. We had a person like that in our section of the 
apartment building. First everyone beat him, but then he got 
hold of a switchblade knife somewhere and, on the contrary, he 
began to stick it to the offenders. 
  And what if Mr. Zhirinovskiy did not invent his absurd plans 
for conquering Turkey out of concern for Russia? What if he all 
the time has recalled how some Turks once offended him, the poor 
thing? Here is what the Istanbul newspaper MILLIYET wrote in 
1969: "The Soviet translator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was put 
in jail in the city of Iskenderun for communist propaganda. The 
local authorities warned him repeatedly that this would not be 
allowed. But he, paying no attention to the advice and warnings, 
not only distributed badges depicting Lenin and Marx among 
Turkish workers and engineers, but even agitated for a communist 
way of life." A couple of days later for a significant 
dollar bribe V.V. was brought to the USSR embassy in Ankara and 
a couple of days later he left Turkey.... 
  One wonders if Zhirinovskiy were caught in the States if he 
would declare war on them? And would he press the nuclear 
button? In order to get revenge for an insult? 
  Politics without personal ambitions is not politics. But it 
is terrible when a person is bruised in childhood and does not 
receive his bread and then begins take revenge against millions. 
  The first part of "Last Thrust to the South" is 
biographical. 
Here Vladimir Volvofovich discusses only bruises and meager 
bread rations. And his failures at sex. Here, for example, is 
what happened on the beach when Zhirinovskiy was 17: "I 
was lying there with a girl, she was in a swimming suit, our 
relations were normal, friendly. I asked her to take off the 
bottom of her swimsuit. But what kind of girl takes off her 
swimsuit the very first thing. I did not know that I was 
supposed to do that myself, to help her, and I was embarrassed 
too. So we lay there until somebody disturbed us." 
  And later: "If I had been born into a well-off family, 
in a Russian city, among Russian people...I would have had 
childhood friends nearby, a girlfriend--then, perhaps, I would 
not have taken up politics." 
  Lord, why did she not take off her swimsuit then!

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Mitrofanov: "White Terror Announced: </F>
Novodvorskaya Tries on Kornilov Tunic"] 
  [Text] A truly historical party meeting of capital 
organizations of the Russian Democratic Union was held in Moscow 
during the last days off. 
  "We decided to deal with the Communists with our own forces, 
and to switch to white terror." Valeriya Novodvorskaya, leader 
of the DS [Democratic Union], agreed to comment for MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS on the results of the party gathering of radicals. 
"To personally see to it that the newspaper ZAVTRA does not come 
out, that they do not conduct their rallies, and that communist 
and fascist symbols do not appear on the streets. To establish 
in Moscow detachments of White Guards, which already exist in 
the country--Kornilov detachments with very nice skulls on their 
sleeves. The Constitution and the president have no support 
other than self-defense and even attacks of the anti-Communists. 
Because it is stupid to defend ourselves from them with words." 
  Well, then, does Valeriya intend to physically destroy the 
Reds? "Well, to start with, physically as well," says Miss 
Novodvorskaya. "We simply want them just to sit at home and be 
afraid to come out on the street." 
  There are about 50 people now in the Moscow Democratic 
Union, 
but what kind! All those who had a "propensity for socialism or 
cowardice" were discharged from the Democratic Union back in 
March, according to Novodvorskaya. And now the Democratic Union 
"represents a potential combat organization, only not a social 
revolutionary one, but one that is completely White Guard."

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Mironov: "V.V.Zh Has Disagreements with </F>
Pamyat"] 
  [Text] Mr. Zhirinovskiy is a programmed computer 
filled with the positions and postures of all the parties," 
believes Dmitriy Vasilyev, leader of the national patriotic 
front Pamyat. 
  He spoke yesterday at a press conference on the occasion of 
the refusal of the Ministry of Justice of Russia to register his 
front's charter. Assessing this kind of reaction by the state 
organ as "genocide against Russian thought and the Russian right 
to a world outlook and a political position," Vasilyev continued 
his tirade directed at V.V.Zh. He called absolutely groundless 
the suppositions that Pamyat and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia] are united. In his opinion, this Liberal 
Democrat preaches ideas of national socialism, and his 
militaristic statements set the Russian people against other 
people and states. The statement that the Russian boot will be 
washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean is political 
adventurism, if not political provocation. 
  The Pamyat leader said that V.V.Zh. "likes to call himself a 
Russian and speak in behalf of the Russian people. But it is 
necessary to be honest and not hide his nationality."

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Mitrofanov: "National-Republicans Are </F>
Not Shouting `Sieg Heil': They Honor the Criminal Code and 
Support the Mayor"] 
  [Text] Rumors about infringements by the democrats of the 
rights of opposition parties in the upcoming elections, it 
appears, turned out to be greatly exaggerated. Besides Baburin's 
ROS [Russian National Union] and Zyuganov's Communist Party, 
even Nikolay Lysenko's National-Republican Party is getting 
ready for 12 December. Although if I were personally asked just 
a month ago to name the principal fascists of Russia, without 
stopping to think, I would have named: Lysenko. And only then: 
Barkashov. 
  But the leader of one of the most radical groups of Russian 
nationalists is able to sniff the wind in order not to break his 
neck in the example of his less pragmatic double--the leader 
Barkashov of the defeated Russian National Unity. 
  Both of them came from Vasilyev's Pamyat. Both of them 
aspire 
to the role of savior of the Russian nation. The first thing 
each of them did was to muster troops for themselves--according 
to their own calculations, 500 militants each. Thus, why does 
the leader of the NRPR [National-Republican Party of Russia] 
call the leader of the RNYe [Russian National Unity] his exact 
opposite? 
  "Indeed, Lysenko is a Russian nationalist, a person with 
ultranationalistic views. But this ultra does not shout `Sieg 
Heil,' rather the opposite, and he categorically rejects those 
who shout `Sieg Heil'--this is the way Nikolay Lysenko sees 
himself. [no close quotes as published] 
  Barkashov, in Lysenko's words, "obviously lived in some kind 
of unreal world, a world of illusions." After all, it is 
impossible in the final analysis to wear a swastika on one's 
sleeve and throw up one's hand in a Nazi greeting while living 
in a country that still remembers the 30 million who died in the 
war with German Nazism and simultaneously count on popular 
success among the public. 
  The sensitive leader of the NRPR is another matter. 
  A year earlier Lysenko had already made a clever move. The 
president had scarcely attempted timidly to stop the formation 
of militarized structures under political organizations with an 
edict when Lysenko formally detached from the party the Russian 
National Legion that had gained fame in the Ossetia battles and 
in Pridnestrovye. (However, the president's salvo then, in 
contrast to October of this year, proved to be a dud.) 
  The evacuation this summer of the NRPR from the FNS 
[National 
Salvation Front] "with the absolutely wild positions of the 
communist organizations," as it later became clear, also became 
a prudent step for Lysenko. (In revenge, the red Sovraska 
[SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA] insulted the nationalist, accusing him in 
his appeals of "Russian-Jewish unity.") 
  The NRPR leader also "realistically assessed the situation" 
in the first days of October of this year. He not only did not 
rush to defend the White House, as was done by the romantic 
Barkashov, but even refrained from any kind of commentary on 
those events. Yeltsin, of course, "crudely violated" the 
Constitution, Lysenko would say later, but it was a 
"sovok"-type, and deserved it: "I foresaw that Rutskoy and 
Khasbulatov would lose." 
  It is simply that the leader of the national-republicans 
needed the elections in order finally to get out to the people, 
albeit over the corpses of former allies who had perished. 
  Who could expect that the competing Communists would be 
given 
free rein. "If I were in Yeltsin's shoes, I would not allow the 
participation of the Communist organizations in the upcoming 
elections," Lysenko admitted to a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS 
correspondent. 
  The national-republicans were also compelled to be a little 
concerned about Mikhail Astafyev's Constitutional Democratic 
Party, whose voting list was rather inopportunely headed by the 
well-known fighter against Russophobia, Igor Shafarevich, and 
"iron Shurik" Nevzorov. It is they who will accurately gather up 
the entire patriotically concerned electorate. 
  But the most devastating blow to the Lysenko followers was 
delivered by Yuriy Luzhkov, our respected mayor, who declared 
war in the capital on the uninvited guests from the south. But, 
after all, the promise to "severely punish" the "southern 
occupiers" is the keystone of the NRPR election program, whose 
implementation (with general approval, which is sad) Luzhkov has 
already practically started. 
  "I understand very well that this is a demagogic move just 
before the elections," says Lysenko, "but I do not doubt that 
Luzhkov is the pioneer in this matter." 
  So, who will continue these beginnings? The elections will 
determine this. The Lysenko group has little possibility of 
surmounting even the 5 percent barrier. And probably all that 
will remain will be to take off the tattered sheepskin and say 
in one's natural tongue: "Sieg Heil!"

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Minkin: "Vladimir Volfovich--a Pure </F>
Russian! But Sometimes a Little Jewish"] 
  [Text] Let us engage in some racism. It is a shameful 
pastime, but it is entertaining. It is especially pleasant to do 
this at night on the eve of the nativity of Jesus Iosifovich 
Christ. He is now God, but when he was crucified he was a poor 
Jew, the son of Mary and Joseph, the great-great-great grandson 
of Solomon, David... (there is more detail on Jesus Christ's 
genealogy in the Gospels). 
  You will not find a Russian named Volf on any kind of church 
calendars and, indeed, anywhere at all. Such fantasies do not 
exist among Russian parents, although it, fantasy, is very 
rich--it allows itself Adolf, and Elzevir, and Akakiy, and 
Dazdraperm (Long live the first of May). 
  In German, Volf means wolf. In small-town Jewish 
pronunciation--it is Vulf. Volfson, Vulfson are typical Jewish 
last names; in a literal translation--the son of Volf (wolf plus 
sohn). 
  On 14 December, at 1500 hours (it is nice to be precise), 
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy explained his nationality. This 
happened at his press conference at the International Press Club 
(Slavyanskaya Hotel) in the presence of 500 journalists. 
  Zhirinovskiy, as is well known, answers any question 
forcefully and rapidly. So rapidly that he does not have the 
time to think about logic. Therefore, concerning the humiliating 
position of the Russians, he promises to correct this matter, 
for "there are too many persons of a certain nationality on 
television." But to the question about racism, he angrily denies 
having anything to do with it: He says, I love all nations, it 
will be good for everyone, and it will be bad only for enemies. 
  When my turn came, I asked: 
  "You declared that there will be 99 percent Russians in your 
government. How do you intend to determine their nationality?" 
  Zhirinovskiy set out to show that it was necessary for 
Russia 
to have a purely Russian Government. One can argue here, for 
Russia needs intelligent PEOPLE, and not questionnaires and 
genealogies. Let us say that many would agree on Margaret 
Thatcher. But I had no wish to argue. I wanted to get a direct 
answer to a direct question. And I interrupted the fuhrer: 
  "Excuse me, but you did not answer: HOW AND ACCORDING TO 
WHAT 
FEATURES will you identify Russians? According to the shape of 
the nose? According to a blood analysis? Explain the METHOD of 
identification. 
  Zhirinovskiy did not like this. He angrily uttered the 
irreproachably liberal formula: 
  "He who considers himself Russian is Russian. He who 
considers himself a Jew is a Jew. He who considers himself a 
Tatar is a Tatar. 
  This is a noble approach. It can even be said that it is 
Jewish. In 1990, while in Israel for four days, I saw a lot of 
Russian people there who had immigrated on forged documents. I 
even became acquainted with a cheerful girl, Klava from 
Leningrad, who, chuckling, related how for a small payment she 
became a Jewess, "having lost" her old passport. 
  In Jerusalem I asked a highly placed MFA [Ministry of 
Foreign 
Affairs] official how Russians who arrive on forged documents 
are treated? He waved his hand indifferently. 
  "We do not force anyone to pull down his pants. If a person 
calls himself a Jew--he is a Jew." 
  It is accepted that Zhirinovskiy is of the same opinion. But 
soon a foreign journalist, who spoke Russian fairly well, got to 
the microphone. 
  "Mr. Zhirinovskiy! Everyone is quoting your words that your 
mother is Russian, and your father is a lawyer. The inference is 
made from this that your father is a Jew. How is this reconciled 
with your anti-Semitism, and is it not time to answer precisely 
the question about your nationality?" 
  Everyone gasped. No one yet had the courage to ask a 
question 
about this anecdotal Russian-juridical hybrid. Zhirinovskiy 
answered brilliantly! 
  "This was fabricated by newspapermen. I never said that my 
mother was a Russian, and my father--a lawyer. It is simply that 
I answered questions at one rally. I read the question: What is 
your mother's nationality?' I answered: `She is Russian.' After 
a certain time, I get a piece of paper. I read the question: 
`What is your father's profession' I answered: `A lawyer.' But 
what was I supposed to do. Imagine, I get the question: What is 
my father's profession, and I answer--Russian. I would be called 
insane!" 
  The audience laughed and applauded. One needs talent to 
extricate oneself so brilliantly. Even if he lied, it was still 
brilliant. 
  Further, Zhirinovskiy explained his genealogy all the way 
back to his grandfathers and grandmothers. `ALL ARE PURE 
RUSSIANS, THERE ARE NO KINDS OF MIXTURES.' The parents of the 
father, it is true, are from Poland, but, after all, Poland is 
not a state, it is one of the Russian provinces... 
  That is the way it is. 
  But it was different recently. 
  I have an interesting document in my hands. 
  The form: "Communist Party of the Soviet Union. CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE." Stamp: "Top Secret." 
  "Excerpt from protocol No. 101 of the meeting of the 
Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee 29 March 1983. 
  Concerning the establishment of an Anti-Zionist Committee of 
the Soviet public 
  1. To concur in the proposal of the propaganda department of 
the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR KGB to establish an 
Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet public. 
  2. To confirm the staffs and official salaries... 
  5. To confirm the nomenclature of the positions of the CPSU 
Central Committee for the Anti-Zionist Committee... 
  7. To publish the appeal of the initiative group to Soviet 
society in the newspapers PRAVDA, IZVESTIYA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, 
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, the journals NOVOYE VREMYA, SOVETICHE 
HEIMLAND, and newspapers of the Union republics and the Jewish 
Autonomous Oblast... 
  8. To instruct the propaganda department of the CPSU Central 
Committee to examine jointly with the USSR KGB plans for the 
work of the committee and to render the necessary assistance in 
their implementation." 
  There are secret attachments to this Top Secret protocol: 
about rates of pay, material-technical support (the building, 
the Kremlin telephone exchange, high frequency, a polyclinic of 
the Fourth Administration (with members of families), 
automobiles...); expenditures in rubles and hard currency for 
international activity... 
  The Soviet people could not even imagine how much the 
struggle against Zionism cost it, and more specifically the 
state anti-Semitism of the CPSU and the KGB. Dozens (and perhaps 
hundreds) of fighters against Zionism travelled throughout the 
world: to Austria, Argentina, Israel, Spain, Italy, the United 
States, France, the FRG, and Sweden. The countries are all 
somehow sick with Zionism. If at least someone would help the 
fight against Zionism in Mongolia, Poland, and Bulgaria... 
  But it soon became clear: The West perceived the 
Anti-Zionist 
Committee of the Soviet public as it should have--as communist 
propaganda and a KGB cover. And then the Anti-Zionist Committee 
(without making a show of it) established the Jewish society 
Sholom. 
  Sholom did not have an open association with the CPSU 
Central 
Committee and the KGB, and--according to the plan of its 
creators--was supposed to become for the West the authentic 
voice of the Soviet Jews. Comrade Vladimir Volfovich 
Zhirinovskiy spoke at a Sholom organizational meeting. He 
sensibly and clearly commented on the charter. He introduced his 
candidacy for the election list of the leadership of the Jewish 
society Sholom. And--as a result of the vote--became a member of 
the council. 
  Thus in 1988 Comrade Zhirinovskiy became a member of the 
council of the Jewish society Sholom. 
  To my question as to whether the members of the Sholom 
society clarified Zhirinovskiy's nationality, one of the leaders 
at that time answered: 
  Sholom was established by Jews, they created a Jewish 
society. All the members and all the leaders were Jewish. This 
goes without saying. In addition, Zhirinovskiy's face and accent 
are rather characteristic. 
  We have a remarkable country. If people like you, you are 
Russian. If they do not like you--you are a Yid. 
  Lenin's grandfather was liked--he was Russian; people 
stopped 
liking him--he became a Jewish Kalmyk. Yeltsin was liked--he was 
Russian. He became disliked--he became Eltsin. And Solzhenitsyn 
was Solzhenitser, and Sakharov--Tsukerman. 
  WHEN THE COUNTRY ORDERS YOU TO BE A JEW, anyone will become 
a 
Jew! 
  This clear, sincere, vital (bloody) argument made many 
Soviet 
people shake with feeling. 
  When the newspaper DEN started to hate Yeltsin--they wrote 
about him: Eltsin is the ringleader of the occupiers, the puppet 
of the Jewish-Masonic lobby. 
  When MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS and other democrats see Volfson 
(that is to say, Volfovich), we also first of all expose the Jew 
in him. 
  Because we are a united people, and we like to drink 
(something on Easter, something on 7 November). And why should 
we examine the nuances of the anticrisis program when there is 
such a native, pleasant, usual, and simple method of determining 
who is a friend and who is an enemy. 
  We are a united people. Only in our country 90 percent of 
the 
jokes are built on national arrogance: topknots, Yids, Chukchi, 
Armyashki... 
  We roll with laughter, while a foreigner, if he understood 
the joke, blushes and diverts his eyes. This is not funny in his 
country. It is improper. It is forbidden. 
  Well, the hell with them! We will enjoy ourselves. 
  "What is the fastest animal in the world?" 
  "A cheetah?" 
  "No a Chechen in a Mercedes!" 
  These are dangerous jokes. People may laugh, or they may 
kill. 
  But he who was always despised in Russia was he who 
repudiated his own father. If you betray your father, you will 
betray your fatherland also. 
  There he is--forceful, zealous, clever, an elusive liar, 
clambering to the top. Like a Jewish member of the council of 
the Sholom society. Like a Russian member of the State Duma. 
  He is horrible! The whole world held its breath! Parliaments 
are meeting in fear. The Group of Seven, the UN Assembly, and 
the Baltics are trembling!.. 
  And before whom? Just who is he? Who the hell knows! 
  Whether he is a schizophrenic (typical speech: rapid, 
without 
thinking, without pausing, wound up. Saltykov-Shchedrin's 
"little organ": I will pull apart! I will destroy!) Whether he 
is a paranoiac (there are enemies, enemies, enemies all around). 
Whether he is a child of the Lubyanka; he had his fill, matured, 
broke away from the leash, and started his own game, but the 
confused Lubyanka is not able like Taras Bulba: "I gave you 
life--I can take it away." 
  In 1988--a Jew; in 1993--a pure Russian... 
  Oh, how I understand you, Vladimir Volfovich! It is 
sometimes 
the same with me. I wake up in the morning--like a Russian; the 
weather outside the window is Russian, the books on the shelves 
are only Russian. But when I watch you on TV, and your little 
falcons--no, I am still a Jew. Although Russian also. 
  P.S. Grow a moustache, Vladimir Volfovich, for heaven's 
sake, 
it is about time.

Money to the LDPR: He Financed His Own Campaign With 3 Billion 
Rubles"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Financier </H5>
  Andrey Zavidiya, president of the Galand concern, was never 
a 
member of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], and has 
not given it any kind of material support since 1991, and what 
is more, did not finance the LDPR during the elections to the 
Duma. In any case, this is what he himself claims. In the words 
of Zavidiya, he only cooperated with the LDPR (within the scope 
of his own political projects) and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, with 
whom the president of the Galand concern had "friendly 
relations" for a long time. However, the cooperation between the 
concern and the LDPR ended after a dispute that took place 
during the election campaign, and Andrey Zavidiya now intends to 
engage in political activity independently. 
  In his words, his acquaintance with Mr. Zhirinovskiy took 
place in November 1990. The president of the Galand concern was 
attracted by the program of the LDPSS [Liberal-Democratic 
Program of the Soviet Union], "which had nothing in common with 
his (Zhirinovskiy's) current views." Later, Zavidiya appeared 
together with Zhirinovskiy in the presidential elections in 1971. 
  He insists that in 1993 he did not finance Zhirinovskiy's 
party, but his own campaign. In Zavidiya's words, he was 
officially placed on the party election rolls, presented to the 
Central Electoral Commission, and as a candidate was given an 
officially stamped certificate. However, a little later Zavidiya 
was crossed off the rolls in violation of all procedural norms. 
However, according to Zavidiya's claim, during all of the time 
of cooperation "not a single kopek, in the sense of transmitting 
money or giving it to someone from the LDPR, was transferred. 
  Galand concern enterprises paid the telephone bills and 
covered expenditures for travel and press products. All told, 
according to preliminary estimates, about 3 billion rubles [R] 
were spent. Andrey Zavidiya emphasized that all this was done 
within the framework of his own election campaign: Galand 
structures agitated for the LDPR only because the name of the 
president of the concern was on the political roll of the party. 
About 50 percent of the party members are my supporters." 
However, after the dispute it was impossible to stop the Galand 
working machine, and the concern's enterprises continued to 
agitate for Zhirinovskiy's party, thinking, probably, that they 
were doing this for the good of their own president. 
  Now Andrey Zavidiya intends to achieve the restoration of 
his 
rights and really obtain a Duma seat. Moreover, there are plans 
for the creation of a large party on the basis of 1,500 
enterprises of the Galand concern system, expanded and 
reinforced by 3,500 organizational committees. The proposed 
party will have to be centrist and "cooperate and be on friendly 
terms with both the left and the right." 
  At present, two examples of Andrey Zavidiya's participation 
in party life after the break with the LDPR are known. The 
president of the Galand concern is closely associated with the 
organizational committee of the Leftist Russia party, which 
stands on firm communist positions. In addition, he joined the 
organizational committee of the Majority Party (see SEGODNYA No. 
100), which, according to the assurances of its leaders, is 
closer to the reformers in its positions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army General Viktor Yerin, Russian minister </F>
of internal affairs, by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief 
Vladimir Starkov; place and date not given: "Not Just a 
Detective..."] 
  [Text] The Russian minister of internal affairs, Army 
General Viktor Yerin, visited our editorial offices a few days 
ago. Below is an interview with him. 
  [Starkov] Viktor Fedorovich, I want to start our 
conversation 
with a possibly unexpected question. How do you feel about art? 
  [Yerin] There probably has not been a single great writer 
who 
has not tried his hand at the mystery genre. There are also very 
interesting works by our contemporaries. Take Astafyev's "The 
Sad Detective." I keep telling my personnel department: Before 
you hire a candidate to work for the militia, give him this book 
to read, because it describes quite objectively the dirty, 
thankless side of the militia's everyday work. And at the same 
time the book shows a man who is sincerely devoted to his 
profession, who does not spare himself in the goal of protecting 
the people. At the time, "The Sad Detective" made a very deep 
impression on me. Unfortunately, as soon as we filled the 
screens with criminal elements' "heroics," this tremendously 
affected our youth. 
  [Starkov] You do not believe in the theory that, seeing a 
crime on the screen, a person undergoes a sort of self-cleansing? 
  [Yerin] I do not believe this. Western statistics show that 
scenes of violence, scenes of the "romantic" side of the 
criminal underworld, stimulate a rise in crime. There are known 
cases of crimes committed precisely according to the scenario of 
the film shown. Any phenomenon may be presented in a different 
way. You can show the disgusting side of crime, or you may 
package it like candy: See, these are also heroics of sorts. 
When I was just starting my career I had encounters with 
old-school criminals. At the time the process of "crime bosses" 
establishing themselves was underway. They also had their own 
criminal "romantics." And it was this "romantic side" that they 
used to recruit a certain stratum of youth into their ranks. 
  [Starkov] Clinton delivered his State of the Union address a 
few days ago. Before it he polled 50 senators and state 
governors regarding the most serious problem facing the country. 
All 50 said: crime. Is this a universal problem? Have we entered 
some different stage of civilization? 
  [Yerin] Crime is indeed on the rise all over the world; a 
sort of criminal boom is underway. The Israeli minister of 
police, power engineering, and infrastructure visited me 
recently. He did not even want to talk about his problems after 
he heard me speak of ours. What is Israel, with its 5-5.5 
million population and 19,000 policemen? And Russia, with 150 
million people and 3 million crimes a year? 
  [Starkov] I was in Seattle at the Goodwill Games. I spent a 
whole day riding around the city with police. The police car 
itself was like a monster, stuffed full of equipment. The 
computer display continuously flashed messages of new incidents. 
It turned out that in addition to uniformed police they also 
have undercover police. And in addition to undercover police 
also mounted police. And in addition to mounted police also 
patrols on bicycles. That is, the entire city is covered by a 
net of police investigation. Of course, we currently cannot 
afford this either physically or financially. Are we making any 
progress, however? 
  [Yerin] We are. For two years the internal affairs organs 
have led a semi-pauper existence. Our highest achievement is 
that in these conditions we have preserved the system of organs 
at all, not allowing it to disintegrate. 
  [Starkov] What is the average pay in the militia these days? 
  [Yerin] About 200,000-250,000 [rubles]. For the second year 
now we are also providing a food allowance, that is, once a 
month an employee is issued a certain parcel of foodstuffs or 
the monetary equivalent. I also get it once in a while: It 
consists a can of fish, cereal, and so on. 
  [Starkov] But the situation in Moscow is better in this 
respect, is it not? 
  [Yerin] On the contrary, it is quite often better in the 
provinces. Over there, people more often ask for this allowance 
to be issued in cash equivalent, especially those who live in 
rural areas. In the countryside, even if they themselves do not, 
their relatives do some farming, have a cow, and will always 
send some milk and meat their way. 
  [Starkov] How many people does the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] have on payroll these days? 
  [Yerin] The personnel of purely militia units now numbers 
570,000 across the entire Russia. Of course, in terms of the 
militia-to-population ratio we are behind the West. Our ratio is 
now 3,000-4,000 population per precinct militia officer, and 
they constitute the bulk of the force. 
  [Starkov] Do you often get woken up in the middle of the 
night? 
  [Yerin] When I worked as a criminal investigations division 
chief, it happened much more often. Back then I was counting the 
nights I was not woken up. 
  [Starkov] How do you make the decision on whether to contact 
the president regarding a specific incident or not? 
  [Yerin] The criteria are the gravity of the incident and the 
number of victims. For instance, hostages are taken and the 
lives of a group of children are in danger. Or it is a major 
traffic accident with tens of people dead; or a rail disaster. 
Even if I am woken up in the middle of the night, I will find a 
way to report to the president immediately because I know that 
there is no other way. In addition, there is a system of weekly 
reports. It has been set up by the president himself. 
  [Starkov] Which day of the week do you report to him? 
  [Yerin] Enforcement ministers report on Mondays. My domain 
is 
the sociopolitical situation: rallies, mass manifestations that 
have taken place over the week, their dynamics, comparisons, to 
what extent law and order was maintained in the course of their 
conduct, their social thrust and the pretext for holding them. 
  [Starkov] I heard that when a minister goes in to report, he 
decides for himself whether to alarm the president or not. 
  [Yerin] The president and I had an agreement from the very 
beginning that I would give him honest information. I think this 
is also in the president's interests. I know, of course, how to 
manipulate statistics; how to influence the president; how to 
make it so that crime rate in our country will begin to 
"drop"--only on paper, though. But this will be a lie, 
self-deception. I report very unpleasant things to the 
president, including things that do not look good for me 
personally. I believe that we have to take the blows of fate as 
they come, and be honest. 
  [Starkov] Do you exercise? 
  [Yerin] No. All my life I have not been able force myself to 
exercise. But I get a workout on the tennis court. I will try to 
play some even today. 
  [Starkov] Readers will not understand if I fail to ask you 
about the events of 3-4 October. How do you assess your actions 
at the time? 
  [Yerin] My conscience is clear, because I did everything I 
was supposed to do as the minister of internal affairs. That we 
have been able to deal with this problem with minimal human and 
political losses is to a certain extent not my achievement as 
minister as it is of the system itself. I do not want to hurt 
journalists' feelings, because they were writing in the heat of 
the moment. But paradoxical things resulted from it. For 
instance, there was a report that "an MVD unit went over to the 
White House side, and what kind of unit does the minister have 
that has betrayed the president?" I, on the other hand, wanted 
to commend the commander of this unit. His company found itself 
under fire from the White House; he saw that one soldier was 
wounded, another killed. A commander at any level has to think 
about minimizing losses. He was able to move the unit into a 
covered area, and ensured the safety of his personnel. I had a 
clear picture of it within 10 minutes--it was reported to me 
through the chain. 
  [Starkov] Were you actually there? 
  [Yerin] I visited the militia chains regularly, went there 
both at night and during the day. 
  Or, for instance, journalists asked me: "Why did you stand 
by 
and watch the commandos ride to Ostankino and not stop them, not 
open fire on them?" Just imagine for a moment what this would 
involve--to start shooting at a bus on Mir Prospect. And a bus 
with innocent people in it at that. 
  Of course, I understand perfectly well all the damage that 
resulted from the tanks shelling the White House. But talk to 
specialists. Using this method of bombardment produced minimum 
casualties and demoralized two-thirds of the people in the White 
House while at the same time not inflicting any wounds or 
contusions--they simply could not stand it and went to the 
ground floor for shelter. 
  [Starkov] I remember the time when people who went to work 
for the militia were mostly uneducated. 
  [Yerin] Yes. The people who taught me had four years of 
grade 
school. They were detectives by intuition. 
  [Starkov] Do you remember your first assignment in the 
militia? 
  [Yerin] I remember the first case I solved. It was in Kazan. 
There was an October cinema there--it no longer exists, it has 
been razed. In the yard of the cinema was a public outhouse made 
of wood boards; a woman was raped there. She ran to the theater 
and told them what had happened. We combed the area of the city 
and caught the bastard by description. 
  [Starkov] A new amnesty is being readied. How many convicts 
will be released? 
  [Yerin] A very insignificant number. Less than 10 percent. 
We 
now have about 500,000 people being kept in correctional 
institutions, and about 300,000 in preliminary investigation 
facilities. The amnesty draft includes mostly elderly people 
whom it is simply inhumane to keep in detention (people over 60, 
disabled people, World War II participants), juveniles, and 
people who committed a crime for the first time--either through 
carelessness or those who do not represent undue social threat. 
Those who have committed grave offenses will not be amnestied. 
  [Starkov] We get letters in which convicts tell of the 
horrible conditions in which they are kept. 
  [Yerin] I do not like it either that we keep people in 
conditions more fit for cattle. Literally a few days ago a 
government decree was signed containing concrete figures in 
terms of how much the government can allocate today for repairs 
and construction of new prisons. We are now building several 
preliminary investigation facilities to a design that has been 
approved by an international expert commission. It is a very 
original system--a "daisy": First the main block is built, and 
then you can add wings to it--one, two, or even five, depending 
on the need. 
  [Starkov] We have seen prisons in American films: bars upon 
bars; prisoners sit there like animals in a zoo. Is this the 
system you consider modern? 
  [Yerin] I do not see anything wrong with having both bars 
and 
strong locks. When we get richer, I will gladly order the 
installation of the most modern electronic locks that can only 
be opened by a magnetic card. And I will be very glad when we 
get to the level of Denmark, where we were asked to wait five 
minutes before entering the corridor because the prisoners were 
finishing their lunch and were not to be disturbed. They have 
two locks on each cell. I asked why. It turned out that one lock 
is secured by a warden after bedtime, and the other one is for 
the prisoner: He can lock it from the inside if he does not want 
to be disturbed. The Danes told me about a Russian who had 
committed a crime there, and wrote to his mother that he had 
been detained by the police and was doing time in prison. She 
should not worry, the letter said, because this was not prison 
but a very good hotel; he was well fed, and had very nice living 
conditions. 
  [Starkov] You shovel human dirt. To do this one must 
probably 
have special psychological traits? 
  [Yerin] Of course. Do you think it is a great pleasure to be 
present at an autopsy when the forensic pathologist is 
dissecting a corpse? He tells you: "Look, there is a smell of 
alcohol from the stomach. Look, he ate beet salad and a tomato 
an hour before he was killed." This is our work. What keeps us 
going is the enthusiasm of a detective following the scent of a 
trail. 
  I will remember this case for the rest of my life. We were 
dealing with an aggravated murder and rape case. We arrested a 
suspect--a huge, aggressive bull of a guy. He turned out to be 
impotent. We could not get his sperm for analysis. We brought in 
the medics and finally squeezed this "product" out of him. The 
blood type was identical. The murder case was apparently solved. 
A month passed. Late one evening the department chief stops by 
my office and says: "I have a nagging feeling about it. I do not 
think it is him. Let's let him go." We let him go, and a month 
later we found the real murderer. Do you know how much effort 
you have to make not to harden, professionally and as a human 
being, in this stream of daily calls to murder scenes? We had to 
handle 29,000 murders last year! 
  At the beginning of the conversation we touched on the topic 
of how important it is for literary and cultural figures, for 
artists not to forget about the people of our profession--we 
need an escape valve more than anyone else. I constantly work on 
myself, keep telling myself: "Remember, the absolute majority of 
people live a normal human life; they are honest and decent 
people; the criminals are a small minority." Otherwise, I would 
have to suspect everyone. 
  And the nerves you need for this work. For instance, a 
militia officer receives information that a person is in illegal 
possession of a weapon (perhaps committing robberies and 
muggings with it). The officer detains this person, risking his 
life in the process since he does not know whether he will be 
shot at or not. A criminal proceeding is initiated. Then the 
court decides: two years of suspended sentence. The man leaves 
the courtroom, walks over to this militia officer, and says: "I 
will buy a submachine gun tomorrow, and then we will talk." This 
is not just a Russian problem. 
  [Starkov] But in other countries, the police are feared. 
  [Yerin] And why? The point is the level of the general legal 
culture of the population. A respectful attitude towards the 
police has been instilled over decades. In America, for 
instance, there are two "sacred cows"--journalists and police 
officers. Nobody wants to tangle with journalists because the 
journalistic brotherhood will come out on top in the end anyway. 
And nobody wants to tangle with a policeman. If God forbid a 
policeman is killed or wounded, tens of criminals will get shot 
while this crime is being investigated. And everybody knows that 
the police will go on a rampage, shooting right and left. 
Frequently it is better for the criminals themselves to hand 
over the perpetrator in order to stop the police terror. The 
police are respected and feared. 
  [Starkov] Why would you not ask for the help of the military 
to fight crime? 
  [Yerin] I have always been against the military 
participating 
in the maintenance of law and order. The president, too, said to 
me several times: "Look, why do you resist it?" And I keep 
replying that we should not do this, it is wrong. First, 
bringing the military out into the streets is always politically 
damaging for us. Second, each should do his own job, and bear 
his own share of responsibility. You say we do not have enough 
militia? Let us beef up the force. 
  Tell me, what can I ask of a 19-year-old kid-soldier who has 
only been taught how to shoot a submachine gun? He does not know 
how to work with the public, how to work with individual 
citizens. 
  I remember myself in that young age. Senior Sergeant 
Kuznetsov was explaining to me how to walk like a militiaman. I 
have always moved fast, but he kept telling me that a militiaman 
should walk slowly, with a measured step, looking left and 
right, evaluating the situation. You see a group of 
youngsters--walk over, start a semi-lighthearted conversation. 
With younger ones, be more gentle; with older kids--a degree of 
sternness. This sergeant was a psychologist. I would like to see 
at least 90 percent of MVD personnel be like that Sergeant 
Kuznetsov. 
  As a minister and a member of the government, I believe that 
my priority task is to use all possible means to instill a more 
respectful attitude toward our system, to raise its status. And 
I have enough powers vested in me, enough of everything to do my 
job.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Once Again on the Outcome of `Shock </F>
Therapy': From the Report of the Economics Division of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences and the Reform International 
Foundation `Socioeconomic Transformations in Russia: Current 
Situation and New Approaches'"] 
  [Text] Two years (1992 and 1993) is a sufficient period of 
time to make it possible to sum up the outcome of "shock 
therapy" and evaluate its results. These are far from 
unambiguous, which is quite natural since socioeconomic 
developments always have positives and negatives. The final 
balance and evaluation of the consequences of emergent 
tendencies are important in this matter. 
  The process of overcoming the total statization of the 
economy and creating diverse forms and types of economic 
operation has continued and largely accelerated during the 
period in question. The formation of an infrastructure of a 
market economy and its characteristic mechanisms has begun; the 
mechanism of supply and demand has begun operating, albeit with 
disruptions; the first signs of competition have appeared. The 
mentality of economic cadres who are adjusting to the conditions 
of an emerging market economy is changing. A new generation of 
managers--educated, energetic, and free of the baggage of old 
dogmas and habits--is assuming management responsibilities at 
various levels of economic operations. A stratum of 
entrepreneurs has been gradually evolving. 
  While evaluating favorably the movement toward a market 
economy which has gotten underway, we should nonetheless note 
the continuously growing and largely excessive "price" which our 
society has already paid and will be forced to pay for the 
selected strategy and tactics of transition to a market economy. 
  The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a 
result of "shock therapy" and its internal structure, is 
affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly 
painful manner and is fraught with the irreversible destruction 
of the economic and scientific-technical potential of the 
country. 
  In the last two years alone the fall in production on key 
macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the 
precrisis level, approximated 40 percent. It is important to 
stress that, first, the drop in production is of a universal 
rather than structural nature and second, it has affected the 
most progressive and high-technology industries and types of 
production to the greatest degree. 
  The ideologists of "shock treatment" view the consequences 
of 
the production slump quite flippantly; they believe it to be 
temporary and easy to make up. To make this more convincing, 
references are made to historical experience whereby the country 
restored its past might within relatively short periods of time 
following tremendous destruction and losses (as a result of the 
civil war and the Great Patriotic War). 
  The following must be said in conjunction with this: 
  First. Under current conditions, declines in the 
volume of production mean the loss of markets, and not only the 
world market (for example, in the aerospace industry, in the 
production of armaments, etc.) but also the domestic market. 
There is no such thing as a vacuum in this area. Having once 
yielded positions on the market, it is extremely difficult to 
regain that niche. In other words, the process may turn out to 
be irreversible. 
  Second. Historical analogies are hardly convincing 
in this case. The time when it was possible to restore the 
economy with the help of the shovel and the hoe, drawing on mass 
enthusiasm or coercion of the population, is gone for good. In 
the modern world, this may only be accomplished by drawing on 
state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and organization of 
production. Having missed this opportunity, the country could 
inevitably be doomed to protracted or perhaps eternal 
backwardness. 
  A slump in investment activity is the most profound and 
dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the 
last two years alone the volume of investment in the Russian 
economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to 
about 40 percent of the precrisis level. 
  Not only structural changes but even the elementary growth 
of 
production is impossible given this volume. However, the problem 
is more profound and complex. The amortization of fixed 
production assets has already come close to 60 percent, i.e., 
the threshold beyond which the physical destruction of the 
production potential of the country begins. Our society has 
become a witness to a growing danger of accidents and disasters. 
  The mounting crisis has affected the scientific sphere 
(including basic and sectoral research, design and development 
activities, and trial and experimental production). First-rate, 
world-level collectives are falling apart before our eyes; 
leadership status on a number of avenues for 
scientific-technical progress is being lost; physical facilities 
are becoming hopelessly obsolete. 
  The country is losing its intellectual potential, and 
together with it--hope for the rebirth and prosperity of Russia. 
  Inconsistent and on occasion impulsive actions of the 
government and the Central Bank of Russia, the absence of a 
clear-cut and well-conceived financial strategy, and the 
selection of financial stabilization measures which were not in 
line with the actually emerging conditions have produced 
extremely unfavorable results. 
  Disorganization of the financial system and loss of control 
over monetary circulation is one of the results of the policy of 
"shock therapy" and the methods of its implementation. In two 
years there has been no success in normalizing the budget 
system, despite attracting enormous credit from the Central Bank 
and artificially withdrawing monies from the Pension Fund to 
cover the deficit. The payments crisis which was caused by 
ill-conceived actions and the inability to ensure the normal 
intake of taxes merely undermined the revenue base of the budget 
and caused a chronic budget deficit. 
  The financial system of the national economy as a whole is 
facing the most difficult situation (including the financial 
situation of enterprises and regions). Fixed assets are being 
systematically "eaten away." Amortization has lost the feature 
of being one of the most significant and most reliable sources 
of investment and is not in a position to ensure even the simple 
reproduction of fixed assets. The number of unprofitable 
enterprises and those with slim profit margins is growing. 
  The payments crisis, or the breakdown of payments relations 
on an unprecedented scale, began against the background of a 
campaign to liberalize prices and tighten budgetary and credit 
policies. Initially it was accompanied by reductions in the 
volume of production; by the end of 1993 it had acquired new 
features and manifested itself as a mass stoppage of enterprises 
(including giant enterprises) which was not associated with the 
bankruptcy procedure. 
  The government extensively used emission to carry out its 
populist statements and as a drug of sorts for "emboldening" 
production. During the last two years the government has been 
the main borrower of funds from the Central Bank. The issuance 
of state short-term bonds which got underway covers merely 2 
percent of the deficit of the consolidated budget; the bulk of 
the deficit is still financed out of Central Bank credit (at the 
preferential rate of 10 percent). 
  The emission of cash increased from 1.5 trillion rubles [R] 
in 1992 to R10.1 trillion in 1993, and its proportion in the 
total money supply increased from 24 to 37 percent. Virtually 
all cash put into circulation last year was retained by the 
population or services the nonbank circulation of resources. 
  The disorganization of the financial system, the "war of the 
budgets" between the center and many regions, the payments 
crisis, and the uncontrolled emission all testify to the loss of 
state control over monetary circulation. 
  The growth of inflation which was triggered by the 
liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. In 1993 
the average monthly rate of inflation was even higher than in 
the previous year (if we omit the January "surge" in 1992). The 
failure to combat inflation is explained by a failure to 
understand its nature in the economy of Russia (underestimating 
its highly monopolized structure, ignoring the factor of cost 
inflation, and so on), and correspondingly opting for 
inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of 
demand constraints. 
  All of the above makes it possible to conclude that the hope 
for financial stabilization without overcoming the slump in 
production is turning out to be illusory and theoretically 
unsound. 
  During the last two years, privatization has been the most 
apparent sphere of institutional changes in the Russian economy. 
It has been advanced the farthest in the trade sector, public 
catering, and the service sector. By the end of 1993, nonstate 
trade enterprises accounted for three-quarters of retail sales. 
The process of "large-scale" privatization in industry has 
begun. The reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has 
virtually ended; companies of various types have been formed; 
the farmer-owner sector has been emerging, albeit at a 
decreasing rate. 
  The course and consequences of privatization have been far 
from unambiguous. Its positives include first of all the 
destruction of the total statization of the economy and the 
emergence of a growing stratum of quite energetic real owners. 
The value system and behavioral motivation of a significant 
proportion of the population have been gradually changing with 
the appearance of a securities market. At the same time, 
privatization has not brought about the inflow of investment, 
and has not noticeably influenced improvements in effectiveness. 
In a number of cases, technological connections were disrupted 
unnecessarily. 
  The unfavorable consequences were largely due to the failure 
to think through privatization itself and haste in carrying it 
out. Administrative pressure and the monotony of the forms of 
privatization (orientation exclusively toward the creation of 
publicly held joint-stock companies) have remained; no reliable 
legal foundation has been laid. The issuance of vouchers did not 
ensure the popular nature of privatization, as proclaimed by its 
ideologists; a drop in the value of vouchers in real terms and 
their concentration in a small number of investment funds are 
fraught with not only the further stratification of society, but 
also the growth of social tension. Warnings and recommendations 
found in the previous report of the RAN [Russian Academy of 
Sciences] Economics Division and the Reform International 
Foundation have not been taken into account. 
  The concept of the abandonment of regulation of economic and 
social processes by the state has led to the universal loss of 
manageability. World experience in state regulation, especially 
in countries with socially oriented market economies, has been 
completely ignored. The special role of the state characteristic 
of transitional stages of social development has not been taken 
into account. 
  As a result, a vacuum of state regulation has developed, 
which is being filled with increasing vigor through, on one 
hand, the growth of narrow-group and regional-separatist 
interests and the plain plundering of national wealth, and on 
the other hand, the real and equally dangerous restoration of 
authoritarianism camouflaged by pseudodemocratic slogans. 
  The breakdown of existing state government structures which 
has far outstripped the creation of new, modern forms of 
government and regulation has brought about the disruption of 
vertical and horizontal economic relations and technological 
interaction. Control has been lost over prices and incomes, and 
the distribution and redistribution of material and financial 
resources. 
  The results of the implementation of the monetarist policy 
and the withdrawal of the state from regulating economic and 
social processes as a component of this policy have indicated 
the theoretical and practical unsoundness of the course chosen. 
  The depletion of social resources for the continuation of 
"shock therapy" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of 
this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the 
population by a factor of more than two accompanied by a sharply 
growing differentiation in incomes has aggravated the social 
situation in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent 
of the most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same 
proportion of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10. 
One-third of the population have an income below the official 
subsistence minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about 
15 million people, are below the threshold of physical survival. 
This is a signal that society is entering a social conflict zone. 
  It should be stressed that this is not just about 
quantitative indicators. Profound qualitative changes have 
occurred in the last two years; trends have emerged which 
indicate a looming threat to the genetic pool of Russian 
society. The process of depopulation of the populace has begun, 
with the growing death rate due to a considerable degree to 
alcoholism, murder, and suicide. The population has been sharply 
marginalized; the number of beggars, vagrants, alcoholics, and 
drug addicts has been growing. The quality of the "human 
material" is deteriorating at quite high rates (immunity against 
mass diseases has been declining; prostitution, venereal 
disease, and births of impaired children are on the rise). 
  The moral pillars of society, social values and ideals, 
personal and family hopes which have always made it possible to 
survive what appeared to be temporary adversity, are crumbling. 
Crime is growing and becoming more arrogant; mafia groups 
proliferate. Bribery, extortion, and embezzlement have become 
massive and no longer cause protest or condemnation by the 
government. 
  All the above makes it possible to say that the social price 
paid by our society for "shock therapy" has exceeded the maximum 
permissible limits. 
  The scale of the economic and social calamities that have 
befallen Russia poses a real threat to its national security. 
The country has ended up at a dangerous threshold, on crossing 
which it may face the risk of forever losing the chance to be 
reborn as a superpower. 
  Such is the outcome of the two years of the "shock therapy" 
policy. 
  The most radical reformers justify in every way the 
destruction and sacrifices as unavoidable costs associated with 
fundamental changes in the existing political, social, and 
economic system and the "return" of Russia to the ranks of 
civilized countries. On the contrary, the RAN Economics Division 
and the Reform International Foundation are convinced that: 
  --no objective, up to the promise of a new variant of "the 
bright future," can justify the social sacrifices which Russian 
society has made and to which it is inevitably doomed in the 
event that the chosen course is continued. A different approach 
is immoral and inhumane; 
  --the society that is actually emerging in Russia today is 
far removed from the models existing in countries with highly 
effective and socially oriented market economies. It amounts, to 
a greater degree, to a society based on excessive 
property-related stratification, corruption, organized crime, 
and external dependency. From the socioeconomic standpoint, this 
is not taking a step forward but rather setting the country back 
two centuries, to the era of primitive, "barbaric" capitalism; 
  --all programs for the renewal of Russia and its 
socioeconomic structure may have a chance at success only if 
they take into account, along with worldwide tendencies, the 
originality of Russia, the peculiarities of its history and 
culture, the spiritual stance of the population, and the 
requisite value system. Russia does not need to return to world 
civilization--it has always belonged to it, and belongs to it 
now as an irreproducible type of a structure of civilization. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  An analysis of the course of the reform and the outcome of 
the socioeconomic development of Russia in the last two years 
makes it possible to draw a number of conclusions. 
  First. A deep crisis and social calamities are not 
the result of unsolved problems that had piled up in the past, 
isolated miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative 
forces (although all these have also occurred), but rather an 
unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and 
the methods used to carry it out. 
  Attempts to solve all problems with a "single leap" or a 
"cavalry charge" were not dictated by sober scientific 
calculations but rather by impatience and political ambitions. 
Contrary to the assertions of its initiators, this course was 
and is extremely idealized, and is being implemented by 
neo-Bolshevik methods. 
  Second. Having experienced the failure of the 
chosen course of economic policy at the very first steps of its 
implementation, the originators of "shock therapy" did not learn 
a lesson but continued to stubbornly insist on staying the 
course. This only further exacerbated the situation and burdened 
the population with new hardships. 
  To cover up their fiasco, the reformers who were in power 
went about systematically misinforming the public and distorting 
the picture of the genuine situation in the economy and the life 
of the people. 
  Third. From the very beginning, an erroneous 
orientation toward the decisive role of foreign aid was adopted, 
and internal sources for stimulating business, especially 
investment activities, were not put to use. It became clear 
quite soon that this was a major miscalculation. Under no 
circumstances can the meager amount of this continuously 
promised aid seriously influence the results of transformations 
in Russia. However, no major adjustments in the area of economic 
policy were made after that, either. 
  Fourth. A claim to infallibility, to knowing the 
absolute truth, has been at the root of many mistakes that have 
been allowed to occur and the reluctance to change the course of 
economic policy even after its complete unsoundness was 
revealed. Hence the reluctance to heed criticism and the 
aspiration to paint such criticism as allegedly originating from 
the "enemies of reform." The notion of the absence of 
alternatives to the strategy and tactics of reform 
implementation chosen by the authors of "shock therapy," rather 
than the reform as such, has been persistently foisted on public 
opinion. 
  It appears strange, but it looks as though some political 
leaders both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to 
believe that any change in the chosen course of economic reform 
means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system. 
The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for 
deliberately refusing to seek national accord. 
  Fifth. The unprofessionalism of the authors and 
champions of the "shock therapy" course has now become obvious. 
It is manifested in a lack of knowledge of the realities of 
Russia and the mentality of the nations populating it, a choice 
of reform methods which are not adequate for these conditions, 
and egregious miscalculations in projecting the economic and 
social consequences of the measures taken. 
  Society has encountered a new variety of subjective and 
willful approaches to the development and implementation of 
economic policy, and in the policy itself--clearly expressed 
ideological attachments. 
  During the entire period the government has evaded a 
discussion of the fundamental problems of socioeconomic policy 
with leading Russian economic scientists and representatives of 
progressive parties, movements, and public organizations. 
  The "shock therapy" course has always been criticized in a 
sharp and well-argued manner. However, we must honestly admit 
that for a long time this course enjoyed quite extensive support 
from the population, which attached their hopes and expectations 
to it. 
  However, a qualitative turnaround in public mood occurred at 
the end of 1993. In the December elections, people resolutely 
came out against experiments associated with "shock therapy." 
Only 8 percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's 
Choice bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and 
champions of this course. To continue this course in the future 
means to act against the clearly stated will of the people. 
  What could such attempts bring about? On one hand, they 
could 
bring about the further exacerbation of the economic crisis and 
the worsening of social tensions in society. On the other hand, 
nostalgia for "the good old times" and the restorationist mood, 
which are quite dangerous for reforms in the Russian economy, 
will mount. 
  The RAN Economics Division and the Reform International 
Foundation believe that, in the name of rejuvenating Russia as a 
superpower, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the past 
two years critically and honestly and to work out a new strategy 
for socioeconomic transformations.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy: "Russia Is Famished for Ideology </F>
of Reforms, While Ideologues Gaydar and Yavlinskiy Wait for the 
Government Exhausted by This Famine To Fall"] 
  [Text] The government's failure over practically the entire 
second half of 1993 to come up with a concept of economic reform 
reflecting at least somewhat the reality of life in Russia has 
opened a niche in economic programming for nongovernment 
experts. The need for ideology after the last symbolic reformers 
departed from Viktor Chernomyrdin's government has grown so much 
that two contenders rose simultaneously to fill the void: one--a 
collective one--in the form of Academicians Abalkin, Shatalin, 
and Petrakov; the other in the shape of Sergey Glazyev, former 
minister of foreign economic relations and currently chairman of 
the Committee on the Economy in the State Duma. 
  Several assessments came out lately; half of them were 
devoted to bashing Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin's work; others 
reiterated Sergey Glazyev's program; and a few attempted a 
comparative analysis of these programs. As we learned the day 
before yesterday from the speech of Minister of the Economy 
Aleksandr Shokhin, there is also a third contender--Saburov. His 
program was delivered to the government through restricted 
channels, however, and at this point its content has not become 
a subject of public discussion. 
  In considering the joint report of the Institute of 
Economics 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Reform Foundation, it 
makes sense to separate two principally different notions. The 
first is the "academicians' program": a notion constructed by 
way of simply renaming the report and the most superficial and 
subjective analysis of it by people who are believers in 
Gaydar's ideology. This notion is simply a projection that only 
remotely resembles the original source. 
  The second notion is the actual report, namely: a list of 
anticrisis measures in different areas of economic policy, void 
of any particular ideological uniformity for the reason that 
each part was written by specialists in that particular area, 
while the three-headed author-academician either from haste or 
for some other reason has not gone the entire length of 
structuring this report into an ideological whole. 
  All those points for which the academicians are being 
"trampled" (such as freezing prices in raw material sectors with 
possible budget subsidies for them and establishing a fixed 
exchange rate for the ruble) do not represent a mandatory 
attribute of the economic policy but are subject to discussion, 
say the report's authors. 
  But what is in the report that is inarguable? That is the 
whole point: The report is not built on positive premises. It is 
based on rejection of the Adam Smith-esque approach to reforming 
Russia. The report's authors absolutely clearly learned the 
lesson of rampant liberalism in Russia, especially so in the 
area of reforms' humanism--or rather lack thereof. Therefore 
many critics of Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin rightfully pointed out 
that the authors make the cornerstone of their program not the 
formation of an economy that would give people the opportunity 
to engage in raising their own level of well-being, but rather a 
direct elevation of their well-being--an ideology which, for all 
its humanism, is absolutely unacceptable for a transition 
period. And the main shortcoming: The report never succeeded in 
identifying the priorities of the proposed economic policy as a 
whole. 
  On the other hand, the report also has unquestionable merits 
with respect to stating and formulating the problems. These 
achievements are especially noticeable in the parts dealing with 
demographics and social problems. Overall, the role of this 
worthless program but decent report is positive: It has 
enlivened the academic and quasi-academic debate, thereby 
contributing to the creation of a favorable incubative climate 
for forming a truly sound economic ideology. 
  The program will be used by the Cabinet of Ministers as an 
encyclopedia of variations of sectoral approaches; by 
lobbyists--as a quotation book; and by radical reformers--as a 
punching bag. 
  Sergey Glazyev came no closer to ideology than the 
academicians. But he is much more concrete and tangible. The 
point is that his formulation of the main tasks takes place not 
in the field of narrowly delimited special sections but at the 
highest level of the expanse of economic policy. His program 
combines methods of monetary regulation of inflation and 
"nonmonetarist" measures. 
  Glazyev's entire work is written as a word for word 
translation--a list of concrete measures that are necessary to 
implement because of the strengthened role of state regulation. 
Much is already being done by the government--for instance, the 
policy of encouraging the creation of financial-industrial 
groups. 
  On the whole, however, Sergey Glazyev's predilection for 
concentrating his attention on concrete things only emphasizes 
the fact that what we have here is not a program of economic 
reform based on medium-term measures but a set of quick fixes, 
that is, precisely the normal kind of economic program that does 
not give the author the right to be considered an ideologue. 
  Among the more interesting points in S. Glazyev's program, I 
would like to name a very (maybe even excessively) clear outline 
of the architecture of a tax system and interesting proposals on 
introducing a flexible system of bank reserves, which would 
increase for short-term and decrease for long-term credit. It is 
quite possible that the government would indeed implement these 
measures, although it would be ridiculous to expect it to carry 
them out to a full extent. 
  This, however, practically exhausts the entire list of 
publicly known programs for saving the Russian economy. It is 
interesting that such a recognized maestro of the period of 
Russian liberalism as Gaydar and his antagonist Yavlinskiy have 
not seriously joined the debate. On the contrary, as soon as the 
niche of economic programming began to be filled by 
academicians, a former minister, and the ex-contender for the 
role of ideologue Saburov, Gaydar began to assume with greater 
zeal than ever before the stance of a politician (Yavlinskiy 
already became a politician long ago). 
  Neither Gaydar nor Yavlinskiy pin any hopes on the 
government 
in the sense of following a particular ideology; both say rather 
unenthusiastically that they will support all constructive 
initiatives of the cabinet and oppose the government's positions 
they do not agree with. As to the former attempts of these 
leaders to head the Cabinet of Ministers, in this case they may 
be interpreted in two ways: as an awareness of their 
responsibility for Russia, or as tactical moves. These 
intelligent and experienced people by all their demeanor send 
the message that the issue of forming a new, or bringing to a 
new level the old, ideology of reform has ceased to be a matter 
of principal importance (whether it is in the current political 
situation or with the current political elite is another 
question). 
  Today, forming an economic policy from the contradictory 
ideas floating in the air with respect to restoration of 
industry and continuing cutbacks in state expenditures belongs 
more in the realm of public relations than the actual ability of 
the government to implement this policy. Gaydar and Yavlinskiy 
understand this, seeing the current uncertainty as a sort of 
transitional stage within the framework of the transition period.

<F P=106> [Article by S.S. Shatalin, president of the Reform </F>
international foundation, academician of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, under the "Point of View" rubric: "The Market Needs To 
Be Managed"] 
  [Text] The Economics Division of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences and the "Reform" International Foundation have 
prepared the joint report, "Socioeconomic Transformations in 
Russia: The Current Situation and New Approaches," and forwarded 
it to the supreme leaders of the state. The report analyzes the 
progress of the reform and the outcome of the socioeconomic 
development of Russia in the last two years. Conclusions have 
been drawn about the need for a new strategy for socioeconomic 
transformations which would make it possible to complete the 
formation of the model of a socially oriented market economy 
that would be suitable for the conditions of Russia and would 
ensure its position among the leaders of the world economy. At 
the request of the editorial office, Stanislav Sergeyevich 
Shatalin, the president of the Reform international foundation 
and an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, discussed 
the main provisions of the report. 
  Two years, 1992 and 1993, is a sufficient period of time to 
make it possible to sum up the outcome of "shock therapy" and to 
evaluate its results. The latter are far from unambiguous, which 
is quite natural. Socioeconomic developments always have their 
positives and negatives. The final balance and the evaluation of 
the consequences of emergent tendencies are important in this 
matter. 
  So, positives first. The process of overcoming the total 
statization of the economy and creating diverse forms and types 
of economic operation has continued and largely accelerated. The 
formation of an infrastructure of a market economy and its 
characteristic mechanisms has begun; the mechanism of supply and 
demand has begun operating, albeit with disruptions; the first 
signs of competition have appeared. The mentality of economic 
cadres who are adjusting to the conditions of an emerging market 
economy is changing. A new generation of managers--educated, 
energetic, and free of the baggage of old dogmas and habits--is 
assuming management responsibilities at various levels of 
economic operations. A stratum of entrepreneurs has gradually 
been evolving. 
  All of this makes it possible to evaluate favorably the 
movement toward a market economy that has gotten under way. At 
the same time, we must note the continuously growing, and 
largely excessive, "price" that our society has already paid and 
will be forced to pay for the selected strategy and tactics of a 
transition to a market economy. 
  The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a 
result of "shock therapy," and its internal structure are 
affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly 
painful manner, and are fraught with the danger of irreversible 
destruction of the economic and scientific-technical potential 
of the country. 
  In the last two years alone, the fall in production on key 
macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the 
precrisis level it approximated 40 percent. I will stress, 
first, that the drop in production is of a universal rather than 
structural nature. Second, it has affected the most progressive 
and high-technology industries and types of production to the 
greatest degree. 
  A slump in investment activity is the most profound and 
dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the 
last two years alone, the volume of investment in the Russian 
economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to 
about 40 percent of the precrisis level. 
  The amortization of fixed production assets has already come 
close to 60 percent--the threshold beyond which the physical 
destruction of the production potential of the country begins. 
Our society has become a witness to a growing number of 
accidents and disasters. The number of unprofitable enterprises 
and those with slim profit margins is growing. The 
disorganization of the financial system, the "war of the 
budgets" between the center and many regions, the payments 
crisis, and uncontrolled emissions all testify to the loss of 
state control over monetary circulation. 
  The growth of inflation that was triggered by the 
liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. The 
failure of combating inflation is explained by a failure to 
understand its nature in the economy of Russia, for example, due 
to underestimating its highly monopolized structure, ignoring 
the factor of cost inflation, and correspondingly opting for 
inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of 
demand constraints. As we can see, the hope for financial 
stabilization without overcoming the slump in production is 
turning out to be illusory and theoretically unsound. 
  The depletion of social resources for the continuation of 
"shock therapy" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of 
this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the 
population by a factor of more than two, accompanied by a sharp 
differentiation in incomes, has aggravated the social situation 
in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent of the 
most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same proportion 
of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10. One-third of 
the population has incomes below the official subsistence 
minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about 15 million 
people, are below the threshold of physical survival. This is a 
signal that the society is entering a social conflict zone. The 
social price paid by society for the "shock therapy" has 
exceeded the maximum permissible limits. 
  A deep crisis and social calamity are not the result of 
unsolved problems that had piled up in the past, isolated 
miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative forces 
(although all of these have also occurred), but rather an 
unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and 
the methods used to carry it out. 
  It appears strange, but it looks as if some political 
leaders 
both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to believe 
that any change in the chosen course of the economic reform 
means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system. 
The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for 
deliberately refusing to seek national accord. 
  In the December election, the people resolutely came out 
against experiments associated with "shock therapy." Only 8 
percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's Choice 
bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and champions of 
this course. To continue this course in the future means to act 
against the clearly stated will of the people. 
  The RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Economics Division and 
the Reform international foundation believe that, in the name of 
rejuvenating Russia as a superpower, it is necessary to evaluate 
the results of the past two years critically and honestly, and 
to work out a new strategy for socioeconomic transformations. 
  We have selected the following as the key parameters of the 
ultimate objective of reforms in the Russian economy which 
should certainly be made more specific and refined with regard 
to individual stages and time periods. 
  It is the orientation of the economy, in terms of its 
structure and motivation, toward accomplishing social tasks, 
attaining a high standard of living, and creating institutions 
and mechanisms that make it possible to combine economic 
effectiveness and social justice. It is the formation of a 
modern system of market relations and mechanisms with an active 
role of state regulation of the economy, a combination and 
mutual complementariness of various forms of property and 
economic operations that ensure stable motivation for 
entrepreneurial and labor activity. Finally, it is the creation 
of a highly effective economy that is flexible and receptive to 
scientific-technical innovations and continually changing social 
and personal needs. 
  The RAN Economics Division and the Reform international 
foundation propose certain initial principles for the 
development of such a strategy. 
  First. Social indicators of the reform should be 
specified and set forth: its goals, as well as the borderlines 
and limits the transcending of which is impermissible under any 
circumstances and for any considerations--a guaranteed 
subsistence minimum, an employment threshold, the proportion of 
expenditures for education and health care in the composition of 
the gross national product, and others. 
  Second. The naive belief in the automatic nature 
of healing the economy with the help of impersonal monetarism 
should be abandoned, and the natural and commonly accepted 
functions of state regulation should be restored. As we see it, 
by way of priority measures the accent must be shifted toward 
supporting material production and stimulating business 
activity, including investment activity. 
  It is necessary to develop an effective industrial policy, 
including structural policy, which will be called upon to give 
the Russian economy a modern image and to improve the 
competitiveness of domestic products on the world and domestic 
markets. Also, the supreme power of the law should be ensured on 
a priority basis, and well-conceived and reliable economic 
legislation, stable "rules of the game" must be created in the 
absence of which it is impossible for entities in the market 
economy to function successfully. 
  Third. We should make a transition to new 
principles for financial stabilization in the national economy. 
They include the elimination of disproportions between 
material-tangible and financial-outlay aspects of reproduction; 
the mobilization of domestic sources of 
accumulation--depreciation allowances, profits, and monetary 
savings of the population; a combination of a firm financial and 
credit policy with selective support for priority sectors and 
production facilities; the use of various forms of regulation of 
prices and incomes, including the establishment of price 
parities and cartel agreements; and the improvement of tax and 
budget policies. 
  Fourth. The course toward the formation of a 
unified all-Russian market, taking into account the 
peculiarities of the federated arrangement of Russia, should be 
made the foundation for the reform. This means shifting the 
focus of implementing the economic reform to the localities, 
with the center retaining the function associated with the 
formation and operation of a unified market. At issue is the 
development of uniform "rules of the game," the regulation of 
monetary circulation, the commonality of the customs territory, 
and ensuring the freedom of movement of goods, financial 
resources, and labor among regions. 
  Fifth. The issue of the role of outside assistance 
in reforming the Russian economy should be reconsidered, with 
orientation toward the domestic scientific, technical, and 
production potential and internal sources of accumulation being 
made the foundation of this strategy. This does not run counter 
to the course of an open economy or of Russia organically 
entering the world economy. However, this presupposes that 
Russia may and should solve its own problems itself for the most 
part. 
  Sixth. The problem of transforming ownership 
arrangements plays a special role. This is one of the key 
avenues for the further development and enhancement of the 
economic reform. 
  We should overcome the ownerless, no-man's nature of 
property, and help each of its forms (including the state form) 
find a real, motivated, and responsible master. There should be 
a gradual movement toward a modern multisectoral economy, in 
which most diverse forms of property are combined and mutually 
complement one another: private and state property, cooperative 
and municipal property, the property of public and religious 
organizations, foreign property, and various mixed forms of 
property. 
  Ensuring the growth of effectiveness and attracting 
investment to expand and upgrade production should be the main 
criteria for making particular decisions concerning 
privatization. It is necessary consistently to wind down voucher 
privatization as a populist direction which is not able to solve 
the problem of social justice but boosts the growth of inflation 
and the disintegration of the production potential. 
  The almost complete loss of manageability in the economy has 
become an extremely dangerous peculiarity of the current 
situation in Russia. A deepening managerial crisis has begun in 
the country; virtually not a single state structure remains that 
has not lost its authority and has not been deprived of genuine 
devices for affecting processes under way in the economy. Laws 
and edicts are adopted, decrees are issued, and programs are 
approved, but the management mechanism does not operate at any 
level. 
  The continuation of this situation renders the development 
of 
any program for enhancing the reforms simply nonsensical; the 
programs are doomed to failure in advance. Not a single one of 
the tasks of overcoming the crisis in the country and a 
constructive continuation of reforms can be accomplished in the 
absence of immediately overcoming the organizational muddle in 
all elements and at all levels and eliminating defects and 
disharmony in the management mechanism. The existing power 
vacuum should be filled to the full extent by restoring the 
status of the principles of state regulation and substantially 
increasing the level of manageability of the economy. 
  The manageability of the economy is an antipode to a power 
vacuum and lawlessness, and it should not be confused with a 
return to the administrative-command system.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Aleks Adamesku, doctor of economic </F>
sciences, and Professor Viktor Kistanov, doctor of economic 
sciences, under the rubric "Sick and Tired of Talking and 
Arguing": "There Has Got To Be a Better Way: Three Forms of 
Economic Operations Are Known in the World Economy--Free Market, 
Planned, and Regulated-Market, But We Are Fixated on One"] 
  [Text] The astonishment of many people at the outcome 
of the elections is altogether astounding. It is hard to say 
what this is largely due to--naivete or ignorance. It is just 
that Russians displayed the wisdom of mature and sober-minded 
people. They know that 90 percent of the enterprises that 
provide jobs for the people were built during the Soviet years, 
and that social benefits that previously did not exist in any 
country of the world date back to the same time. All this is now 
being destroyed at a rate unheard of in peacetime. The president 
himself believes that the patience of the people has to a 
considerable degree run out. Therefore, there is no point in 
looking for the causes of this distribution of votes in the 
"estrangement" of the democrats and so on. 
  Something else is more important at present: finally 
beginning genuine people's reforms. The prerequisites for this 
already exist. The first of them is the new constitution, which 
proclaims a "social" state, which means a state in the interests 
of all the people. The obvious failure of Gaydar's course of 
economic transformations is the second prerequisite. After all, 
reforms are customarily interpreted as transformations of 
aspects of public life without destroying the foundations of the 
social structure, and in political and economic practice they 
are interpreted as positive restructuring. So, the supreme organ 
of representative power should begin to act proceeding from 
these goals. 
  In our opinion it is necessary first of all to throw up 
legal 
obstacles to all destructive transformations that are not 
confirmed by world and domestic experience and are not in line 
with the specifics of the Russian state. This should also be 
codified in the constitution. 
  In Russia, important affairs of the state have been 
frequently made the domain of a narrow circle of individuals, 
and not discussed by the people at all. Meanwhile, according to 
the constitution we have people's power in the country! This is 
why a mechanism for upholding the guarantees in question is 
needed. A preliminary, highly professional public expert review 
of major political and economic innovations with the 
participation of authoritative scientists and economic managers 
could be one of the elements of this mechanism. Upon the 
findings of this competent organ, the parliament would adopt a 
relevant act that would be referred for endorsement to the 
president, and subsequently to the government for execution. 
Some decisions may be put to popular referendums. 
  Therefore, the compulsory monitoring of reforms would 
appear, 
together with timely adjustments in their course, and strict 
accountability, including criminal, would be established for 
violating laws concerning reforms. Such violations should be 
added to the list of unconstitutional actions. By way of 
"insurance," it would be worthwhile to introduce parliamentary 
verification of the competency level of all candidates for 
supreme state positions, as some Western countries have. 
  At present, furious attacks are being registered against 
state structures and their representatives, scientists, and 
practitioners who come out (albeit with a delay) in favor of 
making the market purposeful and organized in nature. However, 
does the reaction indicated not testify to the obvious 
incompetence of the opponents, their lack of a notion of modern 
market relations? It has been said time and again that the plan 
and the market are not opposites; at present, nobody 
successfully operates on the market without a plan. Both the 
Japanese automotive plant that produces on its assembly line 
dozens of modifications of a car for specific consumer-customers 
who are known in advance and the local Fedorov's 
Scientific-Technical Complex "Microsurgery of the Eye" with 
branches all over the country were created and operate according 
to their own plans, while providing incentives to their 
employees by market-economy methods. Unlike Russia, almost all 
other states of the CIS have preserved planning in the national 
economy as a means for organized transition to a market economy. 
Those that have energy and raw materials available have secured 
particularly weighty results in conducting economic reform by 
combining plan and market methods. 
  Those who complain that free enterprise is undermined when 
markets are regulated proceed from technical considerations. In 
the environment of the contemporary social division of labor 
even within the borders of an isolated country, the number of 
production, scientific-technical, financial, and other links 
goes into billions and trillions. To advocate such "freedom" 
means dooming manufacturers to a pernicious blind cruise in a 
boundless sea of market elements. Contrary to their own will, 
supporters of this approach come out as adversaries of the 
market because they doom it to failure when they call the 
champions of the opposing view antimarketers! 
  Genuine rather than illusory market freedom is found in an 
opportunity for each manufacturer to voluntarily select his 
effective "niche" on the all-Russian, interstate, and even 
regional and local markets within the system of organized 
economic space. Without infringing on the freedom of entities in 
the marketplace, a market orientation model which takes into 
account the feasible sequence of the territorial assignment of a 
group of consumers to a group of suppliers is capable of 
ensuring not only maximum profits for them but also perceptible 
benefits for the entire society, for example, by preventing 
nonrational hauling which places a heavy burden on the state 
budget. 
  Understandably, economic space may only be organized at the 
all-state level, using principles and methods of rational 
planning, the development of indicator charts for production and 
sale zoning and normal flows of freight, a system of incentive 
and prohibitive transportation tariffs, and so on. 
  Incidentally, the now common attempts to provide market 
information to consumers in the form of all manner of 
"registers" of enterprises, etc., are clearly inadequate. 
Fundamentally different market data banks are needed that would 
be capable of truly assisting in making relations rational as 
goods, capital, and labor move freely. We must say that the best 
conditions for the organization of highly efficient economies 
have emerged precisely in the states of the former USSR, 
primarily in Russia. This is possible through combining the 
methods of purposeful, planned economic operations (national 
economic plans--projections, programs, projects) with a 
mechanism of market-based incentives (prices, taxes, credit, and 
so on) while drawing on our domestic planning experience and the 
world practice of an organized market economy. 
  The natural, geographic, historical, and other specifics of 
the country influence socioeconomic development substantially, 
and it is impossible not to reckon with them. The authors of the 
well-known "Economics" textbook, K. McConnell and S. Brew, were 
among the many prominent authorities who warned about this. On 
the basis of generalizing the experience of the world, they 
maintained: "The best way of resolving the `unlimited 
needs-scarce resources' dilemma in one economic system may turn 
out to be unsuitable in another." This is why it is simply 
inexpert to blindly borrow the Western monetarist reform 
scenario without taking into account other foreign experience 
(for example, the Chinese) and, most importantly, Russian 
specifics. Does the following question not provide food for 
thought: Why do influential circles of the United States and 
Germany approve a market-based model in Russia that is 
completely different from the one used in their countries to 
overcome grave crises? 
  In conjunction with this we must acknowledge that the term 
"market economy" (like "mixed economy," "economic democracy," 
and so on) does not reflect the essence of the phenomenon quite 
correctly. First, in its contemporary interpretation this 
phenomenon is not reduced to the processes of distribution but 
deeply affects the sphere of material production acting as a 
universal method for its effective development. Second, elements 
of a market exist in any economy; we also had them under 
directive planning. Third, as has already been noted, the normal 
market has long been identical with the organized rather than 
free market, and calls for extensive state regulation; 
therefore, this condition of the economy cannot be considered 
market-based. 
  Three common forms of rational economic operations are known 
in the world economy--free market, planned, and 
regulated-market. Each of them emerges, develops, and is 
progressive at certain historical stages. It is no accident that 
our methods of planned development once showed advantages over 
foreign market-based methods, in particular in the rates of 
economic growth, the resolution of social issues, and so on, and 
were extensively borrowed abroad. Against the background of the 
failure of the current "reform" course, attempts to ignore and 
even reject our former accomplishments are no accident. This was 
manifested even in the replacement of the symbols and power 
structures of the strong but Soviet state with those of a weak 
but prerevolutionary one. 
  One would think that the specifics of the historical 
development of Russia would make it possible to assert in our 
country not just a regulated market economy but a higher stage 
of it--a planned market economy. This should be a synthesis of 
indicator planning, economic optimization programming, and a 
mechanism of market-based self-regulation in the economy. The 
fine-tuning of this model holds the promise of a tremendous, 
previously unparalleled effect. This is why a well-thought-out 
scientific concept of economic reforms is necessary.

Gaydar: The Road To Breakdown, or a Way Out of the Impasse?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>
  The failure of the Gaydar reforms and the inevitable change 
in economic policy gave rise to numerous comments in the Western 
press that amaze me in their ideological direction. The 
beginning of the abandonment of the ideals of American 
liberalism is deplored with undisguised distress. It is 
complained that the West did not help its heroes enough--Gaydar, 
Fedorov, Chubays--and I am not even talking about the president 
of Russia. Correspondents writing from Moscow have no desire to 
look into the face of tragic Russian reality. The arguments of 
the critics of shock therapy are disregarded, and their 
proposals for correcting policy and the resignation of the main 
architects of failed reforms are interpreted almost unanimously 
as a return to the old ways. Appeals to save Russian reforms are 
appearing in newspapers and journals. To do everything in order 
to continue the policy that received the approval of the 
International Monetary Fund and the "Big Seven." They speak 
freely of a wish to have an influence in accordance with their 
own views on the internal development of Russia, as if 
interference in the internal affairs of others in international 
relations has become the natural right of the rich and powerful. 
  Articles in recent issues of the American journal TIME and 
the English ECONOMIST are full of mournful intonations: "A 
gigantic step backward," "the road to breakdown." True, TIME 
still tries to explain to Americans why Russians are 
disappointed in reforms according to the Western formula. 
"Imagine," the journal writes, "that the monthly rate of 
inflation in the United States is 20 percent, the output of 
industrial products is reduced by 15 percent annually, 
unemployment is growing everywhere, and the government has 
obviously turned out to be insolvent." "Imagine," it states 
further on, "that California and Texas have seceded, foreign 
communists are giving advice on how to reorganize the American 
Government... This is the equivalent of what Russia is 
encountering." This is something, of course, that Americans are 
not in a condition to imagine, because this is simply impossible 
in their country. And it is stupid to guess how they would 
behave in a similar situation, but they have taken to giving 
advice to we who are in such a situation. 
  It would seem that the dramatic effect of Russian reality 
should prompt Western observers and analysts to give us advice 
that is somewhat more constructive than a simple toughening of 
that policy that led us into the impasse. But, alas, the 
faith-healing power of the monetarist drug is so great that no 
matter how convincing and well-reasoned the proposals are to 
select a unique Russian path to reform, they are immediately 
rejected as a return to the old ways, and their authors fall 
into the ranks of antireformers. In leading Western newspapers 
and journals, and even in Russian publications that have a 
pro-president orientation, market and democratic reforms are not 
thought of in some variant that is different from "shock 
therapy" and authoritarian presidential power. The idea is 
stubbornly taking hold that this variant has no alternatives. 
  Perhaps it was out of naivete, but I supposed that in view 
of 
the catastrophic economic situation it was especially important 
in the traditions of serious science to analyze deeply and 
thoroughly the reasons for our troubles and, proceeding from the 
established diagnosis, to recommend methods of treatment. 
Unfortunately, the assessments and conclusions from the 
experience of Russian reforms were turned over to the control of 
journalists. In their propagandistic chorus, the voice of the 
objective researchers is barely distinguishable. During the past 
year Russian academic science has already twice come out with 
detailed reports that proposed an alternative strategy of 
reforms on the basis of a critical analysis of our experience. 
The failure of the purely monetarist policy of the stabilization 
of the economy and the market transition was disclosed in a 
number of reports and books of important Western economists. 
However, not only scientific data but also the real everyday 
experience are ignored by the authors of propagandistic stock 
phrases and myths, among whom are members of Gaydar's team as 
well. 
  Thus, an official analyst in a governmental semiofficial 
organ proves that there was no shock therapy in Russia. I agree 
that the policy the authors themselves at first compared with 
Polish shock therapy has little in common with therapy; that is, 
with improving the health of the economy, and with Polish 
reform. But the shock that the population experienced from it 
did take place, and it was truly monstrous. And it cannot be 
covered up with any kind of literary stratagems. In a year and a 
half the real monetary income of the population was cut by 
almost a factor of three, and the quality of life was thrown 
back by 20-25 years. 
  It is more and more difficult for supporters of the Gaydar 
reforms to conceal their failure in the Russian and Western mass 
media. And searches for those responsible are thereby being 
conducted more intensively. Jeffrey Sachs damns the Western 
powers for inadequate monetary assistance to the reformers. 
Others reproach the Russian reformers for insufficient toughness 
in limiting the consumption of the population and for budget 
expenditures. But all agree in accusing the chief banker of the 
country--V. Gerashchenko--who, it is said, did not keep credit 
and monetary emissions in check. 
  At first glance, there are grounds for such accusations: The 
monetary and credit mass in circulation is growing, and so 
prices are also increasing. But many of the specialists in our 
country and abroad do not agree with this explanation. They cite 
the fact that galloping inflation is not caused by surplus 
effective demand, which has been suppressed, but by an increase 
in costs and the behavior of monopolist producers who shift 
continuously increasing expenses and taxes to prices, and also 
by inflated prices that are under the influence of inflationary 
expectations. According to their estimates, in its real 
purchasing power, the credit-monetary mass in Russia (i.e., with 
a correction for price increases) was reduced up to 30 percent 
from the initial level of January 1991. The excess money (the 
monetary overhang) was eliminated in this way. People's real 
monetary income fell to one-third, they were deprived of their 
savings, and enterprises were deprived of working capital and 
development funds. All this was supposed to cause the 
inflationary wave to recede. But the opposite happened. And all 
of this despite the fact that commodities that in the past were 
never an object of trade began additionally to be included in 
market turnover: apartments, land plots, enterprises, etc. 
  In a word, before calling for a further toughening of 
credit-monetary emission, there should be a comparison of the 
physical-material and monetary components of the market that has 
evolved. Such a comparison, more than anything else, will 
confirm the correctness of the findings of academic science: In 
the current situation of cost inflation, anti-inflationary 
measures directed at limiting the monetary mass and reducing the 
budget deficit deprive the entire national economy of the 
possibility of implementing decisive structural changes and lead 
to an intensification in the drop in production. By limiting 
demand and contracting the market, they reduce taxes and other 
budget receipts and thereby intensify inflation. 
  As you can see, the reasons for inflation are not as 
elementary as is interpreted by the adherents of liberal-radical 
reforms. Should we not moderate propagandistic passions and turn 
to the facts? Then, perhaps, even proposals to select another 
trajectory of the movement to the market will not seem like "a 
gigantic step backward." 
  What is especially disturbing is the radical liberal idea of 
intensifying the state's regulatory interference in order to 
stop the collapse of production, prevent social cataclysms, 
chaos, and the further criminalization of the economy, and 
support entrepreneurship. A cry can be immediately heard here 
about a return to the administrative command system and a 
concession to the conservative director corps in industry and 
"the red barons" in agriculture. Meanwhile, world experience 
(especially in the period of the last war and after it) 
indicates that when destructive processes in the economy and 
society go as far as they have in our country, it is unrealistic 
to stop them by means of market self-regulation alone. In the 
period of the postwar restoration of West Europe, foreign trade, 
the currency rate of exchange, and the movement of capital were 
regulated by the states, but the transition to a freely 
convertible currency in current trade operations took more than 
10 years. State price control over key commodities, and also 
subsidies for their support, were continued just as long, and 
they have remained in agriculture and the power industry to this 
day. The state sector played an important role in industry, and 
only now, it seems, is its broader privatization maturing. I 
will add that the successes of the Japanese economy, and 
recently also of the new industrial countries, are in many ways 
tied to the guiding influence of the state on market relations 
and the gradualness of reforms. 
  It seems that in the so-called "deregulation," that is, the 
elimination of the state from the sphere of regulation of the 
economy, Russia, under the influence of liberal theory, went 
further in many spheres than the experience of capitalist 
countries suggests. Hurrying to abolish the instruments of state 
regulation inherited from the former Soviet Union, Russian 
reformers began to rely on the invisible hand of the market. The 
calculation did not justify itself: It is now much more 
complicated to recreate a capable state administrative mechanism 
that is not infected by corruption and bureaucracy, and to 
recreate one not as a counterbalance to the market but precisely 
for the sake of creating a civilized and socially oriented 
market. 
  I cannot comprehend why the Western press refrains from 
reproaching China, where market reorganization is not being 
implemented according to an IMF formula but by means of a 
gradual displacement of state regulation by market regulation 
(and then by no means everywhere), and why so much indignation 
is aroused in it by the proposals of some members of the Russian 
Government to cope with inflation and the drop in production by 
using the same experience. Well, after all, the new American 
administration is also sending Reaganomics, with its ideas of 
deregulation, to the archives. 
  In conclusion, I would like to repeat: The best support for 
our democratic market reorganizations is rejection of the 
imposition of schemes that are foreign to Russian conditions, 
calm businesslike analysis of problems that face us, and respect 
for the abilities of Russian scientists and politicians to find 
a way out of the impasse by themselves. Attempts to condition 
assistance to Russia with the implementation of recommendations 
of the IMF and the "Big Seven," while not hiding the sympathies 
of the West for those who follow this advice in spite of real 
results--all this is capable only of stirring up the 
anti-Western mood in Russian society.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "The Formula for Reform `of </F>
the Soviet Academicians' Has Been Analyzed; Gaydar's Experts 
Considered It Illusory, Declaratory, and Naive"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Resonance </H5>
  The Institute of Economics of the Transition Period (IEPP), 
which is headed by Yegor Gaydar, has analyzed the joint report 
of the Reform Fund that was submitted to President Yeltsin, the 
government, and the Federal Assembly. The Reform Fund is 
directed by Academician Stanislav Shatalin and the department of 
economics of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]. IEPP experts 
called the plans to improve the economic situation in the 
country with the help of the ideas set forth in the report 
"purely illusory." Specific proposals of the authors are 
frequently contradictory. Thus, a gigantic increase in state 
financial investments in the economy is being proposed and, 
simultaneously, a significant slowing down in inflation; the 
stimulation of labor activity is adjacent to progressive 
taxation; the fight against monopolism is right alongside the 
creation of huge concerns and financial-industrial groups. 
Concerning the main postulate of the academicians about the 
decisive role of the state in the transition to a market, 
specialists of Mr. Gaydar's institute ascertain "a departure not 
only from the level of economic science" in the period of 
reform, but "even from the world outlook of the most radical 
reformers of the 1960's." 
  IEPP experts note the outright bias of the authors of the 
academic work. This is in reference to the indices of incomes 
and wages in October 1993 that are compared not with October 
1991, but with December, when advance compensations were paid. 
If, however, the indices are compared correctly, then it turns 
out that they fell not by a factor of three, but by 30 percent, 
and the real incomes of the population were cut by 25 percent. 
  Institute critics also do not agree with the theses of the 
report about the "breaking of the historically established 
structure of consumption of the population" and the 
"hyperintensity of the flow of the process of stratification of 
society"--they are either not confirmed by statistics or they 
are poorly reasoned. According to data of the Goskomstat [State 
Committee for Statistics], in the last two years the share of 
outlays for food in consumer expenditures did not exceed 48 
percent, while the report cites 60-70 percent. 
  Regarding the "state regulation of the subsistence minimum" 
proposed by the academicians, the IEPP experts indicate that the 
question rests not on the methodology of measuring this 
"minimum," but on the financial capabilities of the treasury. 
But to the Gaydar experts the term "subsistence minimum" itself 
"evokes unpleasant associations with the notorious `assortment 
minimum' of the food stores of the epoch of the rayon 
organization for trade in food products, which "they preferred 
not to mention in the 10 prereform years." The idea of 
progressive taxation of incomes also did not meet understanding 
among Mr. Gaydar's employees, inasmuch as this would prompt 
their concealment, the development of a shadow economy, and the 
criminalization of life. As early as 1993, the level of 
unaccounted incomes, according to Goskomstat data, amounted to 
approximately 15 percent of what was officially taken into 
account. 
  The section on regional and structural policy, in the 
opinion 
of the analysts of the institute, represents mainly a set of 
general propositions. This conclusion of the academicians is 
cited as typical: "The adoption of any kind of measures on the 
federal level is expedient only in the event that the 
implementation of the indicated measures can lead to a definite 
load on the regional budget." 
  As for the structural policy that has been conducted up 
until 
now by the Russian Government, its shortcomings are, as the 
experts think, not a defect of the approach itself, but a 
consequence of the objective difficulty of changing the deformed 
structure of the national economy. 
  The IEPP specialists also think that the proposals of the 
academicians on the regulation and establishment of fixed prices 
will also not stand up under criticism. The experience of 
1989-1991 demonstrated that such attempts will lead "to an 
intensification of imbalance in all spheres of production and 
consumption." The experts are particularly put on guard by that 
place in the work of the Reform Fund where the stimulating role 
of price proportions and a rational correlation of prices are 
proclaimed. Besides the fact that the concept of "rational" is 
in principle subjective, practice in the two recent years showed 
that the rates of growth of regulated prices are by no means 
lower than free prices and, in fact, fixed prices were the 
initial impulse for "subsequent inflationary spirals." 
  According to the comments of the critics, the proposal of 
the 
teachers of economics concerning the profitability of 
enterprises reeks of the same naivete. "At first glance," the 
employees of Gaydar's institute write, "the establishment of 
limits on profitability should lead to an acceleration of 
turnover. But it is most likely of all that enterprises will 
take the tested path of escalating costs." 
  In the concluding part of their analysis, the IEPP experts 
dwell on one of the presently most discussed questions--the 
restoration of the manageability of the economy. Here they note 
the main flaw, from their point of view, of the work of the 
academicians--the declatoriness and lack of specific mechanisms 
for the implementation of the proposals: "It is absolutely 
unclear from the report where the boundary of state interference 
will be placed, and how its relations will be built with the 
already existing market infrastructure and administrative agents 
with their already established stereotypes of market behavior 
and independence."

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Illarionov, director of the staff of </F>
advisors to the Russian Federation prime minister: "Economic 
Reforms in Russia: Between Shock Therapy and State Monopolism"] 
  [Text] When evaluating the possible change in the 
government's policy for conducting economic reforms, the 
majority of political figures, scientists and columnists proceed 
from the proposition that the fundamental changes will occur 
along three avenues: 
  a) A significant strengthening of the state's influence on 
economic processes; 
  b) Moving the stress in the transformation of management 
forms and methods from the macroeconomic level to the 
microeconomic one, that is, to the level of enterprises and 
entrepreneurial activity; 
  c) Moving away from a policy of monetarism to non-monetarist 
methods for managing the economy and production. 
  When doing this, it is assumed that the reforms' general 
orientation toward shifting to a market-type economy will remain 
immutable. 
  It is significant that one part of the analysts support the 
above-mentioned changes, considering their implementation to be 
almost the only way out of the "Gaydar blind alley;" the other 
part thinks that such a change in course will be disastrous and 
will lead to the downfall of the entire program of market 
reforms and, as a result, to the revival of a planned-directive 
economy of the Soviet model. 
  The extremely high level of politicalization in the 
appraisals of possible avenues for the future course of reforms 
and their detachment from economic logic call attention to 
themselves. The political right-wing (LDP [Liberal Democratic 
Party], communists, agrarians, and the political forces and 
leaders sympathetic to them) is completely and unconditionally 
insisting on a sharp change in the course of the reforms whereas 
the left-wing (Russia's Choice and the parties siding with it) 
are defending the correctness and necessity for continuing the 
selected policy. 
  Let us ask the question: Was the policy of economic reforms 
conducted during 1992-1993 really connected with a firm 
rejection of state control over the economy in favor of market 
self-regulation and the non-interference of the state in 
economic processes? There is every reason to answer this 
question negatively on the whole. 
  Let us begin with the fact that even the neoclassical 
doctrine of a market economy, which the administration of the 
U.S. economy is now following to a significant degree, does not 
repudiate the principle of state regulation of the economy and 
proceeds from the concept of a mixed economy of the market-state 
type. When implementing market reforms in Russia during the last 
two years, the government not only listened to the voices of 
Western advisers but also took into consideration the specific 
nature of the Russian economic situation and the presence of the 
Soviet economic system's legacy. 
  Even the liberalization of prices, which had the strongest 
influence on the economy, was practically not carried out using 
the shock method but was accompanied and is still being 
accompanied by numerous state regulation measures. State prices 
were maintained for a long time on products from the fuel and 
energy complex, purchase prices for agricultural products 
remained under the strong influence of the state, marginal 
levels of profitability were established on the prices for 
products from enterprise monopolists, extremely low state 
regulated prices (tariffs) for apartments and municipal services 
still exist, and numerous price subsidies from the federal and 
local budgets are being used. 
  One can argue about the success or failure of the 
privatization methods being implemented, including the voucher 
version; however, it is difficult to deny the fact that 
privatization is being directed by state programs. 
  Recognizing that the macroeconomic approach has predominated 
in the policy followed by the government during the last two 
years of reforms, one cannot deny the fact that as soon as 
affairs reached mutual nonpayments by enterprises and an acute 
shortage of their working capital or the threat of bankruptcy, 
the government and Central Bank did not turn enterprises over to 
market forces to be torn apart. State management levers were put 
into operation on the spot, state assistance was provided, loans 
were issued, and credits and even the forgiveness of debts were 
implemented although all these measures undermined the state 
policy for stabilizing currency circulation. If there had not 
been a strong state influence on the economy in Russia during 
the 1991-1992 period, not dozens but many thousands of 
enterprises would have gone bankrupt and the number of 
unemployed would have been not one million but tens of millions. 
  There is no reason to say that the state released social 
processes from its control although individual elements of the 
income and distribution regulation used by the state can in no 
way be recognized as successful. This primarily concerns the 
fact that the state "forgot" a great deal about the needs of 
science and higher education, released from its control the 
processes for an extremely sharp income differentiation, and 
moved to the cause not of those who most needed but of those who 
were "a little louder." At the same time, it is actually clear 
that, with the extremely limited state resources and budgetary 
capabilities, no method of state regulation permits critical 
social problems to be solved. State distribution adds absolutely 
nothing to consumer benefits and services which are produced in 
the country or purchased abroad. 
  Much of the criticism addressed to the tax policy being 
followed is known; however, hardly anyone dares to declare that 
the state is not using tax levers, including the export-import 
duty mechanism. The problem here is different: What is the 
maximum permissible taxation level, how should the collection of 
taxes be guaranteed and is it necessary to pursue a state 
protectionist policy through taxes? 
  Apparently, the rebukes addressed to the government, which 
consist of the fact that it has impacted poorly on structural 
policy through the regulation of investments, are not devoid of 
justification. However, those meager amounts of state 
investments, which the government had and has at its disposal, 
must be directed against its will to the priority branches and 
the critical zones in the economy. Another matter is foreign 
investments and the investment assets of enterprises and 
entrepreneurs: it is necessary to look for levers having a more 
powerful state influence on them. 
  Without disputing the need for maintaining and even 
deepening 
state regulation of the economy during periods when it is in a 
crisis situation, one must understand at the same time that this 
problem is not being solved by a return to directive state 
planning and command, bureaucratic and official management 
methods. One must look for flexible state regulation forms and 
methods that have been adapted to market relations and permit 
the organization, responsibility and interest of economic 
subjects to be maintained by state influence methods until an 
effective competitive mechanism for market self-regulation 
exists in the Russian economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the Expert </F>
Institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, leader of work group under the chairman of the 
Government of the Russian Federation, by Arkadiy Lapshin: "A 
Social-Market Economy Is the Lot of Rich Countries"] 
  [Text] So thinks Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the 
Expert Institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, work group leader under the chairman of the 
Government of the Russian Federation. 
  [Lapshin] Many postcommunist states, after the initial stage 
of tough reforms that were painful to the population, came to a 
"softening" of the socioeconomic policy. Do you have the 
possibility of carrying out an adjustment toward "softening" 
without slipping into the "comfortable" bosom of the 
administrative-command system? 
  [Yasin] If we were to slip that way we would arrive at 
either 
a distributive economy or hyperinflation. When they proclaim the 
slogan "socially oriented market economy" and, moreover, suggest 
making this phrase the banner of the reformation, I do not 
believe in it. Not because I consider it necessary to cast the 
person who has ended up below the poverty line to the will of 
fate and not because everything that is being done seems fair to 
me. But what can we suggest? Increasing pensions and wages? But 
unless we increase production, all this will end up tomorrow as 
higher inflation and nothing more. We must be clearly aware that 
inflation is the most reliable means of fleecing the poor. I 
will say outright that talk of a social-market economy is cheap 
demagoguery. 
  [Lapshin] But do you really not think that certain aspects 
of 
the social policy must be reinforced? 
  [Yasin] Yes, I think we need serious measures that would 
contribute to fairer distribution. But this does not mean the 
onset of a stage of a social-market economy. The latter is the 
destiny of rich countries. After all, it is no accident that 
when Erhard conducted the reform in Germany he said nothing 
about it. Only after the very severe policy had led to financial 
stabilization, an upsurge of the economy, and an increase in 
business activity was it possible to begin to speak about 
distribution. After all, what is a social-market economy? It is 
above all the principle of distribution. Take from some and give 
it to others through the state. As for the countries of Eastern 
Europe, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have just reached 
the stage where they have basically achieved macroeconomic 
stabilization. They are now faced with the problem of 
production, and they do not know what to do with it. 
  All countries that are in a process of transition from a 
communist system of economy are experiencing largely similar 
stages. Achieving macroeconomic stabilization is the simplest 
thing. But then comes the most difficult task: how to breathe 
life into this economy, how to make people work, how to make 
goods appear. 
  [Lapshin] Do you think the Russian economy has reached this 
point? 
  [Yasin] Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved 
macroeconomic 
stabilization. But I think that, while continuing our efforts to 
achieve it, we must now create the necessary mechanisms, above 
all financial ones, for increasing the effectiveness of our 
development. 
  [Lapshin] There is a point of view according to which the 
economic reform is being conducted in the interests of less than 
10 percent of the population of Russia. If this is so, it is 
almost frivolous to speak about any nationwide campaign for 
increasing effectiveness. 
  [Yasin] I do not subscribe to the theory of conspiracies 
against Russia and its people and I do not think that anyone in 
the government is conducting a policy in the interests of a 
narrow stratum of the population. Anyone who exploits the 
conspiracy thesis is a demagogue and a populist. The current 
policy basically reflects the interests of Russia and its 
future. Of course one could say that it is turning out to be bad 
and wrong. But the possibility of changing the policy that is 
being conducted exists within a very narrow range. I have 
emphasized repeatedly that any reasonable government of Russia 
would have to pursue approximately the same policy. There are no 
alternatives to it. 
  [Lapshin] Let us assume that there are no alternatives. But 
it is possible and probably even necessary to make some 
adjustment to the course. 
  [Yasin] We can now begin to focus on the tasks of the next 
stage, which involves the creation of preconditions for economic 
growth. We can relax our monetary policy and pay wages to 
miners, peasants, and scholars, from whom the state (not the 
suppliers and not the consumers, but namely the state) is 
holding back payments. This will lead to a certain rise of 
inflation, but all of these steps must be taken within that 
narrow range of possibilities I mentioned earlier. In other 
words, we must set in motion a very delicate and precise 
mechanism for fine-tuning our economy. And we simply do not have 
the possibility of making any global changes: If we pursue any 
true alternative, social explosion and economic chaos are simply 
inevitable. 
  [Lapshin] Nonetheless the policy being implemented now is 
also generating mass dissatisfaction among the population. 
  [Yasin] Indeed, it will lead to significant negative social 
consequences. And we have reached a point where we must regulate 
it. For example, it is necessary to regulate the growing 
differentiation of incomes, but only in a reasonable way. Thus 
if you put the squeeze on the rich again now it will be bad not 
only for them. Because the appearance of this stratum of people 
is a positive phenomenon for the Russian economy. If the 
authorities provide the possibility of investing private capital 
in the economy, they will do it more quickly and effectively 
than the labor collectives who have seized a large share of the 
property of privatized enterprises. 
  [Lapshin] You frequently meet with representatives of our 
private business circles, what do they absolutely insist on? 
  [Yasin] First of all, personal security. Second, guarantees 
for their private property. Third, certain tax breaks which they 
could have by investing capital namely in the Russian economy. 
  [Lapshin] Excuse me, it is impossible to speak about any 
stage of effectiveness when a decision is being made to unify 
the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It would seem, thank 
God, that the unification process has proceeded, but why should 
Russia have to pay for it? 
  [Yasin] So far there is no actual agreement. There is some 
kind of memorandum about intentions. It seems to me that the 
unification must be carried out in a well-thought-out way, 
precluding, for example, a "one for one" exchange of the ruble 
for the "rabbit," having agreed on a single well-controlled 
mechanism for emission. 
  [Lapshin] Will it not turn out that all your discussions of 
a 
new stage of Russian reforms will remain merely good intentions? 
After all, many citizens of Russia will not take any more, they 
are tired, and they are ready to believe in another miracle. 
  [Yasin] If we decide to curtail the reforms we will be 
defeating ourselves once again. I am in favor of applying state 
power and supporting the reformation. Out-and-out populism is 
incompatible with the reforms and life without the reforms holds 
no promise. And if such a policy is begun it is above all the 
simple people who will have to pay for it.
