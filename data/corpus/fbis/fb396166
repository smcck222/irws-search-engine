  Conclusion 
  a. Concerning State of Health of Cleanup Crew 
  As a result of our radiation-epidemiological examination of 
those taking part in cleaning up the aftermath of the accident, 
estimates have been obtained for the dynamics of general somatic 
morbidity for 1987-1991. 
  A statistically reliable general increase in morbidity was 
found, as well as a dose-dependent increase in number of the 
following illnesses among cleanup personnel: 
  1. diseases of the nervous system; 2. mental disorders; 3. 
diseases of the blood and circulatory organs; 4. diseases of 
organs of digestion; 5. sympathovascular dystonia 
  The dose-effect curve for these illnesses is bimodal: 
indices 
of morbidity in the group exposed to a dose of less than 5 cGy 
show a statistically reliable difference from the frequency of 
illnesses for the group irradiated with a dose of more than 30 
cGy, suggesting that the increase in the number of these 
illnesses is associated with the fact of irradiation and those 
induced by it. Based on our study of medical aspects of the 
consequences of the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant, and data of examination of victims under conditions of 
the clinic of military-field therapy of S. M. Kirov Military 
Medical Academy, we can conclude that among persons taking part 
in cleaning up the aftermath of the accident at Chernobyl 
Nuclear Electric Power Plant, not only was there an increase in 
frequency of some disorders, but there was also found to be a 
unique evolution and course of pathological processes: 
  1. Presence of a variety of clinical-hematological disorders 
in the form of isolated or combined cytopenias. The degree and 
dynamics of these disorders differ among the studied contingents 
of victims: those taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the 
accident in 1986-1987; residents evacuated from the 30-km zone 
during the first 7-10 days; residents remaining in radioactively 
contaminated localities. After five days, we continue to observe 
disorders of bone-marrow hemogenesis, including cellular 
differentiation. 
  2. Evolution and unusual course of illnesses of the 
gastroenteritic tract with manifestation of gastrointestinal 
syndrome during the early months following the accident, and 
atrophic erosive hypochlorhydric and achlorhydric gastritides, 
ulcers and stomach polyps. 
  3. Development of pathology of the cardiovascular system 
among a considerable number of victims. Rapid escalation of 
functional disorders into organic shifts is observed 
(neurocirculatory dystonia of various types into hypertonia and 
ischemia), early development of atherosclerotic shifts. 
  4. Occurrence of pathology of the orl-organs and organs of 
respiration from the first days of staying in the zone of the 
accident with subsequent development of atrophic processes of 
the mucous upper respiratory passages. 
  5. Occurrence of disorders of the central nervous system in 
the form of asthenic and vegetative manifestations among most of 
those taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the accident. 
Subsequently there is a rapid progression of disturbances of 
marrow hemogenesis. In isolated cases, shifts of mental state 
are observed. 
  6. Skin disorders in the form of beta-dermatitides of the 
lower extremities and face. 
  The cause of these disorders was not only the effect of 
external beta and gamma radiation, but also incorporation of 
radionuclides and other harmful substances, which was confirmed 
by mass-spectrometric studies (presence of long-lived 
radionuclides: nuclear fuel fragments, boron, lanthanides and so 
on). 
  b. Concerning State of Health of Juvenile Population 
  The overall morbidity of children on 
radionuclide-contaminated territories increased until 1989. In 
the structure of morbidity, a leading place belongs to diseases 
of the respiratory organs, infectious and parasitic, diseases of 
the organs of digestion, the endocrine system, blood and 
hemogenic system (especially iron-deficiency anemias), and 
neuropsychiatric disorders. 
  All republics show an increase in the group of chronically 
ill children, especially with respiratory illnesses. Among 
children of the younger age group who were born to mothers 
pregnant at the time of the accident, the number of acute 
respiratory illnesses is doubled on average. 
  An increase is observed in the specific weight of kidney 
disorders in 1986-1990. There is an increase in frequency of 
abdominal pain, gastritis and dyspancreatism. There is an 
increase in the frequency of astheno-neurotic syndromes. 
  Children exposed to irradiation show high prevalence of 
functional deviations of the cardiovascular system, functional 
cardiopathies. Three fourths of children show sympathovascular 
dystonia, disturbances of sympathetic regulation, and so on. 
Children of preschool age receiving a high dose on the thyroid 
gland may be categorized in the cardiovascular pathology risk 
group. 
  Large shifts are observed in the frequency and severity of 
endocrinological disorders. Aggravation of the course of endemic 
diseases is noted: doubling of the growth of goiter, an increase 
in the number of children suffering from thyrotoxicosis. There 
is an increase in prevalence of hyperplasia of the thyroid 
gland, especially among children exposed to irradiation at the 
age of 1-3 years (three times as often as among other groups). 
Studies of hormonal status indicate the highest degree of 
radiation illness of the thyroid gland for children aged younger 
than three years. 
  There was an increase, especially in Belarus, in the number 
of children with cancer of the thyroid gland; for example, 51 
cases were diagnosed in 1990-1991, of which 29 were children 
from Gomelskaya Oblast. The data of analyses were verified not 
only in the Soviet Union, but also in special clinics of Germany 
and other nations. 
  A study of the immune state showed some reduction of 
cellular 
and humoral immunity, especially among children of women who 
became pregnant three months after the accident. This group of 
children is characterized by an increased number of anomalies of 
development. 
  On territories contaminated by radionuclides there are signs 
of an altered course as compared with the usual for some 
illnesses: bronchopulmonary pathologies and allergic disorders. 
Pneumonia among children shows a tendency toward a more severe 
and protracted course, and less sensitivity to antibiotics. 
  All children living on territories with elevated radiation 
background may be categorized in the group of risk with respect 
to development of unusual post-vaccination complications. 
  Thus, most significant is the change of the symptom complex 
in illnesses of children, and a more severe course of illnesses 
with greater difficulty of treatment. 
  These shifts are similar on radionuclide-contaminated 
territories in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and give evidence 
that the Chernobyl accident has impacted on the health of 
children. 
  c. Concerning the State of Health of the Populace 
  Examination of the population of radionuclide-contaminated 
territories of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia revealed a 
significant growth in frequency of some diseases (both absolute 
and relative). This applies to illnesses of the blood and 
hemogenic organs, endocrine disorders, diseases of the 
gastroenteritic tract and urogenital system, neural and mental 
disorders. Illnesses assume a more severe and protracted nature, 
and are more difficult to treat. An increase is observed in the 
number of malignant tumors, especially cancerous diseases of the 
thyroid gland. 
  In Gomelskaya, Mogilevskaya and Bryanskaya oblasts, a 
special 
epidemiological examination revealed a statistically significant 
increase in the incidence of leukemia and other hemoblastoses in 
older age groups in 1988-1989 (mainly with chronic course). 
  Examination of the population of radionuclide-contaminated 
territories of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia revealed a 
significant growth in frequency of some diseases (both absolute 
and relative). This applies to illnesses of the blood, diabetes 
for Bryanskaya Oblast, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes, 
chronic lympholeucosis for Gomelskaya and Mogilevskaya oblasts, 
cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders for Ukraine, 
cancer of the thyroid gland for Belarus. 
  Thus, the results of examination of the cleanup crew and of 
the juvenile and adult population residing on contaminated 
territories have shown the detrimental impact of the Chelyabinsk 
accident on state of health. 
  General Findings 
  1. After analyzing the materials of various medical 
institutions, statistical data of the Ministries of Public 
Health of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, USSR and republic 
registries, it can be stated that the Chernobyl accident has had 
a detrimental impact on the state of health of the population 
residing on radionuclide-contaminated territories and of those 
taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the accident. In all 
cases, an increase is observed in general morbidity, and in some 
cases in relative morbidity, a reduction in the number of people 
acknowledged as healthy, intensification of severity of 
illnesses and extension of its duration, and less sensitivity of 
disease to the action of medication. There is an increase in the 
number of diseases of the blood and hemogenic organs, 
endocrinological diseases, diseases of the gastroenteritic tract 
and urogenital system, nervous and mental disorders. For many 
cases, it is found that the number and severity of diseases 
depend on the dose of irradiation. There is an increase in the 
total number of oncological patients due to an increase in the 
number of cancerous diseases of the thyroid gland, 
lympholeucoses, and non- Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
  2. Persons taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the 
accident and residents of radionuclide-contaminated regions show 
elevation by several times in the level of aberrations of 
chromosomes in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood that is 
uniquely related to irradiation dose and dose rate. A tendency 
is noted toward an increase in the level of aberrations of 
chromosomes in time among children permanently residing on 
territories with an elevated level of radiation. An elevated 
level of aberrations of chromosomes in lymphocytes of the 
peripheral blood is evidence of real genetic injury of cells of 
the human organism due to the Chernobyl disaster. 
  In regions most contaminated with radionuclides, an increase 
is observed in intrauterine losses during pregnancy, most of 
which have genetic etiology. 
  A statistically significant increase is observed in the 
frequency of congenital anomalies in close follow-up in regions 
most highly contaminated with radionuclides as compared with the 
period prior to the accident. This is also a consequence of 
injury of genetic material among persons residing in regions hit 
by the Chernobyl disaster. 
  A considerable fraction of the genetic damage due to the 
Chernobyl disaster is anticipated among the progeny of 
irradiated parents in the form of multifactor hereditary 
diseases that show up throughout a person's lifetime, chiefly 
during middle and advanced age.

consequences of Chernobyl disaster for the populace, management 
of forestry and agriculture on radionuclide-contaminated 
territories. 
  Introduction 
  Systems of radiation and ecological monitoring of the 
environment in Belarus, as in other regions of the nation, are 
narrowly departmental as a rule. In most centers of population, 
Belgidromet regularly determines the radiation conditions with 
respect to isotopes cesium-137, strontium- 90 and plutonium-239. 
Maps have been published of the radiation contamination of the 
territory of the republic with cesium-137, as well as 
strontium-90 and plutonium-239. At the same time, the 
representativeness and confidence of these maps are inadequate. 
At present only one measurement per 50 ha is taken on 
agricultural lands, and in centers of population with extent of 
1.5-2 kilometers, only 15-20 measurements. For example, within 
the confines of the village of Veprin in Cherikovskiy Rayon of 
Mogilevskaya Oblast, according to data of the former State 
Hydrometeorological Committee of the USSR the density of 
contamination with isotope cesium-137 is 1184 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. However, according to data of a mobile 
radiometric laboratory equipped with a "CANBERRA" gamma 
spectrometer, a detailed study done on 24 March 1991 revealed an 
extensive zone on one street with contamination of the order of 
1850-2035 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. A significant contribution to 
protective measures has been made by household studies of 
radiation conditions and compilation of radiation certificates 
of centers of population of the republic. Radiation 
certification of centers of population has basically been 
completed on contaminated territories, although certification of 
housing and garden plots continues. Certification of woodlands 
and agricultural fields is being done by the Ministry of 
Forestry and the Ministry of Agricultural Products of the 
republic respectively. 
  In 1986-1988 when determining protective measures, good 
reasons were found for leaning toward the use of density of 
contamination of lands with radionuclides as an information 
index. Since completing resettlement of residents away from 
centers of population with density of contamination by 
cesium-137 of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and strontium-90 
of 111 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], and also families with children away 
from the zone with contamination density of more than 555 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/], the overall dose of external radiation for 
most regions does not exceed 10-40 percent, and the principal 
dose of irradiation of residents in affected regions is obtained 
from internal irradiation due to using local food products 
contaminated by radionuclides. 
  Up until August 1990 in Belarus, as in other republics 
affected by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant, standards VDU-88 [for temporary admissible levels] were 
in effect that allowed exposure to internal irradiation due to 
radionuclide-contaminated food products of 0.7-0.8 rem per year. 
Laws of the republic on social protection of citizens affected 
by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plantset an 
effective equivalent dose of the population resident on 
contaminated territories of not more than 0.1 rem per year (7 
rem for life). This has required the acceptance of new 
admissible levels of radionuclide contamination of food 
products. The introduction in Belarus on 1 August 1990 of new 
and more stringent control levels of admissible radionuclide 
contamination of food products was not supported by appropriate 
means of measurement, as most radiometric instruments were of 
type KRVP-4AB with inadequate sensitivity. 
  In November 1990, the international Commission on Radiation 
Protection set stricter upper limits of the dose of irradiation 
of professionals to 20 mSv per year (previously 50 mSv per 
year), and for the populace to 1 mSv per year (previously 5 mSv 
per year). The same ICRP recommendations (No 60, 1990) introduce 
a minimum limit of annual dose of 0.1 mSv for taking protective 
steps (all values stated over the dose burdens from the natural 
background). 
  In 1992, Belgidromet came out with a map of radioactive 
contamination of the territory of the republic with iodine-131 
and the dose rate due to this radionuclide in various regions. 
  In 1991, the Institute of Radiation Medicine of the Ministry 
of Public Health of the Rebpulic of Belarus compiled a catalog 
of doses of irradiation of residents for centers of population 
of the republic, where the density of contamination with 
radionuclide cesium-137 was more than 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. 
Dose loads were calculated by the approved procedure of the 
Ministry of Public Health for external irradiation with respect 
to dose rate and internal irradiation with respect to content of 
cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-239 in milk and potatoes. 
  The catalog covers 1111 centers of population of Gomelskaya, 
Mogilevskaya and Brestskaya Oblasts. In 1991, the dose of 
irradiation of residents exceeded 1 mSv per year in 610 centers 
of population. According to data of Belgidromet, there are more 
than 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities, on 
territories with cesium-137 contamination of more than 37 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. This number of centers of population should 
be increased due to villages and settlements in the Polesye 
district where the cesium-137 contamination density is 18.5-25.9 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and milk meeting standards RKU- 90 cannot be 
obtained. Thus, in 1992 we will need to measure the content of 
radionuclides in food products at more than 2500 centers of 
population of the republic. 
  Following completion of work on compiling the catalog of 
doses of irradiation of residents in centers of population of 
the republic, there will have to be a more precise definition of 
the previously assumed decisions on assuring safety of 
habitation on radionuclide-contaminated territories. 
  The report analyzes the main reasons for the unsatisfactory 
state of radiation-ecological conditions in the Belarus region 
and gives recommendations on necessary measures aimed at radical 
improvement of the situation that has evolved. 
  The book offers an analysis of the state of health of the 
populace of the Republic of Belarus since the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Creation of a network of local centers for radiation 
monitoring of food products for the populace along with the 
state radiation monitoring system will provide the population 
with means of protection from radionuclide-contaminated food 
products. 
  This report has been prepared by a panel of experts from 
Belarus; the base for doing the research was defined by the 
Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which was set up by 
the State Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of 
Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant and the International Chernobyl- Pomoshch non-governmental 
organization. 
  The basic goals and areas of activity of the Institute: 
  development of protective measures and regulations of safe 
production activity and habitation of the populace on 
radionuclide-contaminated territories; 
  comprehensive radiological examination of centers of 
population and territories subjected to radioactive 
contamination; 
  creation of local centers and preparation of dosimeters for 
monitoring food products for the populace, developing and 
producing radiometric instruments for radiation monitoring of 
food products and the environment. 
  Conclusions and Proposals 
  1. The Republic of Belarus was hardest hit by the Chernobyl 
disaster. To assess the scales of the disaster for the republic, 
the following data should be presented: 
  more than two thirds of the radionuclides discharged from 
the 
fourth unit at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant fell on 
Belarus, and one fifth of the territory of the republic was 
contaminated with radionuclides; 
  the population residing on territory with density of 
contamination by cesium-137 of more than 137 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] 
in the republic numbers 2,105,400 (including more than 400,000 
children) in 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities; 
  more than 100,000 people have been resettled from 
contaminated regions of the republic: in 1992, residents were 
resettled from all centers of population in regions with 
contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; more 
than 30,000 children reside on territory with density of 
contamination by cesium-137 of more than 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; 
  the damage inflicted by the Chernobyl disaster on the 
Republic of Belarus, which does not have a single nuclear 
electric power plant, is expressed by sixteen annual budgets of 
the republic; 
  in the post-accident period, incidence of thyroid cancer 
among children increased by a factor of seven over the republic, 
and by a factor of 22 in Gomelskaya Oblast; 
  in zones of radioactive contamination of 17 regions of 
Mogilevskaya and Gomelskaya Oblasts, for three years after the 
accident the frequency of congenital defects of development in 
close follow-up nearly doubled in comparison with the period 
preceding the accident; 
  cytogenetic studies have shown that pregnant women (and 
fetuses) from the southern regions of Gomelskaya and 
Mogilevskaya Oblasts received doses of radiation that increase 
the overall level of spontaneous mutations of chromosomes by a 
factor of 1.5-2, and the number of dicentric and ring 
chromosomes in some mother-fetus pairs increased by a factor of 
4-10; 
  an absorbed dose of 400 cGy or more is considered a 
considerable risk factor of laboratory hypothyroidism and 
autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland among children; 
  significant prevalence of dyspancreatism syndrome has been 
established among children with level of incorporation of 
cesium-137 of more than 0.3 ÊCi/organism; 
  children residing on contaminated territories show greater 
frequency (compared with the control) of persistent asthenic 
states (by a factor of 2), hypochondriac syndrome (by a factor 
of 4.6), phobic syndrome (by a factor of 2.3) and so on; 
  among children and adolescents residing on contaminated 
territories, especially under conditions of elevated 
incorporation of cesium-137, there is an increase in disorders 
of the digestive system. For example, the occurrence of chronic 
gastritides and gastroduodenitises among children and 
adolescents in 1990 in these regions reached 171-297% (in 
the 
control--125-153%); 
  the level of recorded primary incidence of circulatory 
system 
disorders (CSD) in 1990 increased by comparison with 1985 by a 
factor of 3.5 over Gomelskaya Oblast, and by a factor of 2.5 
over Mogilevskaya Oblast. 
  2. The republic program for alleviating consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster for 1993-1995 and ahead to the year 2000 must 
take as a priority direction the production of clean food 
products, implementation of the concept of safe habitation of 
people on radionuclide-contaminated territories. 
  3. Contamination in the Republic of Belarus covers 45,600 
km[.sup]2[/] or 23 percent of the territory of the republic, 
more than 1,866,000 ha of arable land, of which 106,000 ha was 
removed from agricultural use in the first year following the 
disaster; in 1986-1989, a total of 256,700 of arable land was 
taken out of circulation. In 1990 alone, lands wiht Cesium-137 
contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] were 
eliminated from agricultural use, and finally, volumes of 
deliveries of meat and milk from these regions were reduced. 
  4. Research has shown that in the zone of contamination by 
radiocesium of up to 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and by strontium-90 
of up to 11.1 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], all kinds of agricultural 
operations can be carried out by conventional technologies on 
arable lands. Forage with contamination density from 37 to 555 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/] is resown to grass. Radioactive contamination 
of territory by cesium-137 with density of more than 555 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/] makes stock raising unfeasible for practical 
purposes in this zone. 
  5. Standards have been set for the content of radioactive 
substances in agricultural raw material for producing goods 
corresponding to RKU-90 standards. Fodders should contain 5 x 
10[.sup]-8[/] - 1 x 10[.sup]- 8[/] Ci/kg. 
  6. In 1991-1992, the radiological services of the Ministries 
of Agriculture, Forestry, and Public Health significantly 
renovated their inventories of radiometric instruments for 
cesium-137 monitoring; the instruments have high sensitivity 
that allows monitoring to be done in accordance with standards 
RKU-90. Complete retooling in these enterprises requires 
delivery of more than 2000 new gamma-radiometers of Vityaz, 
Belrad, Aliot and RUP 01P6 type. 
  7. The level of admissible content of radionuclides 
according 
to RKU-90 in food products, and the specificity of the diet of 
food products for those living in Belarus are such that the 
possible annual dose burden may amount to 0.17-0.18 rem/yr. And 
milk, baked goods, potatoes and meat comprise more than 70 
percent of the accumulation of radionuclides in the organism. 
There is an acute need for 2-3 times more stringent radionuclide 
control levels with respect to grain, potatoes and milk. 
  8. Food products can be checked for strontium-90 and 
plutonium-239 content only by a radiochemical method (10-14 days 
for one measurement). Experimental models of beta-radiometers 
have been developed for instrumental determination of 
strontium-90 within a few hours (strontium-90 in soil of 20 
Bq/kg within 3-4 hours). Experimental models of alpha 
radiometers are being developed for instrumental determination 
of plutonium-239. 
  9. The law of the Republic of Belarus "On the Status of 
Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as a Result 
of the Chernobyl Disaster" (Article 40) acknowledges the 
advisability of setting up local centers (LC) for radiation 
monitoring (RM) of food products for the populace. According to 
a resolution and with the financial support of the State 
Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of the 
Aftermath of the Chernobyl Disaster, 167 local centers for RM 
have been set up for rural Soviets in Gomelskaya (65), 
Mogilevskaya (42), Brestskaya (26) and Minskaya (14) Oblasts, 
and in the city of Minsk (20). 
  10. The Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which is 
the head institute for LCs, is organizing LCs in the republic, 
and training capable local rural residents in radiation 
monitoring. Plans call for instituting more than 600 LCs in 
centers of population (generally the central homestead of farms) 
where the dose burden of the population exceeds 0.1 rem/yr. 
  11. Certification of the homesteads of villages and farms, 
use of adaptive technologies for agricultural production, 
compilation of maps of isotopic contamination of food products 
and development of regulations for safe production activity and 
habitation will enable protection of the health of the populace 
in regions hit by the Chernobyl disaster. 
  12. The operation of local centers in Brestskaya and 
Gomelskaya Oblasts has revealed considerable contamination of 
food products in centers of population of Belorussian Polesye, 
especially milk, cranberries and wild fruit at contamination 
density of less than 37 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Clean milk cannot be 
produced even at a contamination density by cesium- 137 of 
18.5-25.9 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Haste must be made in cultivating 
and improving natural grasslands, and respecialization of 
agricultural enterprises. 
  13. Laws of the Belarus Republic "On Social Protection of 
Citizens Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster" and "On the Legal 
Status of Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as 
a Result of the Chernobyl Disaster," the first legislative acts, 
are running up against considerable financial difficulties in 
their implementation; assistance of republics of the former USSR 
has practically stopped, especially in convalescence of more 
than 580,000 children. 
  Considering the limited capabilities of Belarus in 
sanatorium 
and health resort facilities for convalescence of children 
(70,000 a year), an immediate task is to set up a 
sanitorium-convalescence base in the republic for 
300,000-500,000 children. Priority and long-term plans should 
include setting up children's year-round 
sanitorium-convalescence centers in clean regions of Belarus 
with incorporation of foreign investments, offering tax 
privileges for such centers and their founders. 
  14. In connection with the scarcity of reliable data in 
world 
science about the effect of low doses of radiation andthe 
no-threshold effect of radiation on man, and passage of new 
recommendations by the International Commission on Radiation 
Protection in November 1990 with appreciably lower limits of 
radiation doses for professionals of less than 20 mSv per year 
(formerly 50 mSv per year) and for the populace of less than 1 
mSv per year (formerly 5 mSv per year), particular attention in 
the republic must be given to minimizing the collective dose of 
irradiation, more precisely determining the effect of low doses 
of irradiation on healthy populations, especially for 
radiosensitive critical groups (a list of 34 illnesses is given 
in NRB-76/87), and working out effective measures for the 
population on territories with contamination density of not only 
555-1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and 185- 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], but 
also with contamination density of 37-185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], 
where the effective equivalent dose exceeds 1 mSv per year.

  [Text] Conclusion 
  Comprehensive mathematical analysis of medical-demographic 
indices in conjunction with characteristics of radiation 
contamination in various regions of Russia has yielded a wealth 
of possibilities for both analysis itself, and for the general 
procedural approach to assessment of the interrelationship 
between health of the populace and radiation impact that has 
been developed as the conceptual base of this analysis. The most 
important result of this work is mathematically confident 
establishment of a direct connection between morbidity and the 
radiation factor on territory with low doses of external 
irradiation. In a broader view, it is a matter of undoubted 
radiation causality of many illnesses of the populace in regions 
of ``Russian Chernobyl.'' At the same time, the discovered 
causality is complicated, and cannot be given any unambiguous 
interpretation in only one direction, positive or negative. Some 
illnesses are typified by decreased incidence with time, and 
improvement of the state of health with respect to given 
illnesses (pneumonia, rheumatism), while others show an increase 
(myocardial ischemia, cerebral illnesses, diabetes and so on) 
for the same radiation conditions. It is important to recognize 
that the general direction of change of morbidity, or the 
overall direction of the change in state of health of residents 
of ``Russian Chernobyl'' unfortunately is negative. This is 
confirmed by the fact of an increase in morbidity, although some 
stabilization, or rather a trend toward stabilization, is noted 
in 1991. There is a lot of work remaining in ascertainment of 
the mechanisms of radiation causality of illnesses, 
reconstruction of the initially received dose of radiation, 
further analysis of discovered facts of ``splitting'' of 
illnesses into two (``+'' and ``-'') groups and much more. 
Perhaps the developed methodology and practice of the 
comprehensive approach will enable more rapid and rational 
advancement in solution of the formulated problems. 
  The problem of the interrelationship between morbidity and 
low doses of chronic radiation exposure is not only of 
considerable theoretical significance, but is also of 
considerable practical importance for the fates of people taking 
part in cleanup of the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric 
Power Plant. A large detachment of Russian volunteer miners from 
Tulskaya Oblast worked on driving a tunnel beneath the exploded 
reactor of the fourth power generating unit at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant. After receiving considerable unaccounted- 
for doses of irradiation, the miners returned to their permanent 
residences in various regions of Tulskaya Oblast (as well as 
Orlovskaya, Kurskaya, Lipetskaya and other oblasts), where the 
contamination density usually does not exceed 5-10 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. According to traditional concepts rooted in 
radiobiology, these densities of fallout of radionuclides 
cesium-137 (and, correspondingly, strontium-90) are 
insignificant, and they cannot form appreciable doses of 
external and internal irradiation. This was indeed the position 
of experts of the International Chernobyl Committee. However, 
this leaves out many factors. First of all, the cleanup men who 
received large doses are still living in this same Tulskaya 
Oblast for the seventh year along with the native population 
(who likewise received certain doses) under conditions of low 
but CHRONIC constant irradiation acting on an organism that had 
already experienced dose burdens in 1986. Some food products, 
especially in homes, are still contaminated. Residents are not 
receiving any supplemental food products rich in protein and 
vitamins. There is no qualified medical assistance or systematic 
observation and monitoring of the health of the population 
(including cleanup workers) in regions of both Tulskaya Oblast 
and other middle Russian oblasts. Under these conditions, the 
possibility of existence of danger must unconditionally be given 
top priority, and the impact of low doses of chronic exposure 
must be taken into account as a risk factor, and not 
deliberately discarded as insignificant, especially as regards 
cleanup personnel still living in contaminated regions. 
  We have already spoken of the inadequacies of Russian 
legislation in the field of social compensation, which to a 
considerable extent is due to the serious economic situation of 
the country. But no less important are the stereotypes that have 
evolved concerning the harmlessness of low doses of irradiation. 
Thanks to these notions, the ``Russian Chernobyl'' of 15 regions 
did not exist, as it were, for 5 years, and it is only within 
the last 1.5-2 years that work has begun on scientific 
investigation of various aspects of the Russian Chernobyl 
problem area. We would hope that this expert conclusion, as all 
publications of ``Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster'' that 
apply to the indivisible Chernobyl region of Russia, Ukraine and 
Belarus, will draw attention of the public and of government 
agencies of CIS nations to the need for increased activity in 
work on Chernobyl, once more uniting the efforts of scientists 
and specialists in solving a crucial problem of our time. 
  General Findings 
  The data given above show that in the near future there must 
be a drastic increase in activity on studying contaminated 
territories of the Russian Chernobyl. There is work to be done 
on development, comprehensive discussion and acceptance of a 
government program for organizing a permanently operating 
monitoring service in each region of Russia that has been 
subjected to radiation contamination. 
  I. The expert proposals set forth below on further 
investigation of radiation conditions in Russia are aimed at 
significantly increasing the extent of radioecological coverage 
of the territory, and developing practical measures for 
alleviating the radiation situation. 
  1. A proposal for aerophotographic-spectral surveys of 
radioactive contamination of the locality in the European part 
of Russia as a result of the Chernobyl accident includes: 
  -surveys of previously unstudied territories on a scale of 
1:1,000,000: 
  Volgogradskaya Oblast; Kalmykia; Saratovskaya Oblast 
(right-bank regions of the Volga); Nenets Province; 
  -a detailed examination of regions with elevated levels of 
reserve of cesium-137 revealed as a result of work in 1991 on a 
total area of 72,400 km[.sup]2[/] (Penzenskaya, Ulyanovskaya, 
Saratovskaya and Novgordskaya Oblasts, and Mordovia). 
  2. Tracing Chernobyl contamination on the territory of 
Siberia by aerophotographic spectral surveys on a scale of 
1:5,000,000. 
  3. Setting up a computer database on radioactive 
contamination and fallout of chemical products. 
  4. Publishing maps of radioactive and chemical contamination 
in the first and second quarters of 1993. 
  5. Producing maps of chemical contamination for territories 
where zones of radioactive contamination due to the Chernobyl 
accident have been observed. This will enable an integrated 
approach to assessments of the synergic (combined) effect of 
anthropogenic contaminants on man. 
  II. Analysis of social aspects of migration of the 
population 
in radioactively contaminated regions of Russia, Belarus and 
Ukraine suggests several general conclusions and some specific 
forecasts relative to regions of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' 
  1. A study of the demographic situation in its various 
aspects should be considered a component of the assessment of 
long-term consequences of the Chernobyl accident, while 
demographic forecasts should be one of the possible guidelines 
of the outlook for development of the region. 
  2. In the near future, the demographic, economic, 
psychological and political situation in the disaster zone, 
especially including regions of Russia, will be determined to a 
great extent by migration of the population. Efflux of the 
population from rural localities and municipal settlements 
constitutes the principal features of this migration. 
  3. Consequences of the efflux are important not just from 
the 
standpoint of future development of the regions themselves, but 
also for the fate of several tens of thousands, and possible 
even hundreds of thousands of people migrating ``at their own 
peril and risk.'' This is essentially an open form of forced 
migration, and the population taking part in this process should 
rightfully be considered ecological refugees with corresponding 
rights to housing in regions of lodging. A significant part must 
be played by regions of Russia to which a flow of refugees is 
coming from Belarus and Ukarine. 
  4. The scales of consequences of the migration go beyond the 
confines of the region directly affected by the accident. The 
large specific weight of movements between republics, especially 
to Russia, confirms conclusions about the global nature, the 
proliferation of consequences of the disaster, rather than 
localization, as oficially expressed. In this connection, the 
problem arises of forming reserve funds for building refugee 
housing and developing a public health system. Appropriate 
intergovernmental agreements are needed on arranging employment 
for refugees. 
  5. Despite regional differences, it is by natural migration 
that the populace is resolving the severe contradictions 
existing since 1986. Trends of migration evidence poor 
effectiveness of stabilization by compensatory measures directed 
at alleviating the consequences of the disaster, especially in 
the region of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' Therefore, the forecast 
of migration subsumes at least two scenarios. According to the 
first, the traditionally inertial scenario, events will occur in 
accordance with the system set forth above. The second scenario 
presumes an effective policy of compensations capable of 
stabilizing the situation, and especially for the forthcoming 
process of migration to the Russian Federation. The uniqueness 
of the situation that has arisen as a result of the break of 
economic ties and administrative structures of the former USSR, 
there is no great optimism relative to the second scenario. 
Nevertheless, implementation of new social guidelines of the 
development of society should include as a priority a truly 
effective and coordinated social policy in regions affected by 
the Chernobyl disaster. 
  III. The consensus on results of expert work in assessing 
the 
state of health of the populace in the ``Russian Chernobyl'' 
subregion is set forth in the Conclusion of the corresponding 
section. Therefore, we will limit ourselves here to a few of the 
most pertinent conclusions drawn from development of a general 
procedural approach and comprehensive multivariate statistical 
analysis of medical demographic indicators and radioecological 
factors of the habitat of the populace in radioactively 
contaminated regions. 
  1. Contingent of people subjected to the action of radiation 
and residing on various territories differ significantly in the 
structure of morbidity. Ecological factors of the regions on the 
whole have a noticeable effect on the state of health of the 
populace residing there. 
  2. In regions with an elevated level of radiation 
contamination, there is a considerable change in the structure 
of morbidity due to an increase in the percentage of rare 
illnesses: in regions of the Chernobyl zone as a whole, there is 
a dramatic increase in the incidence (double or triple) of 
diseases that are virtually not seen in Moscow. 
  3. Based on the example of Tulskaya Oblast, trustworthy dose 
dependences have been discovered between morbidity and degree of 
radiation contamination of regions, which serves as direct proof 
of radiation causality of some illnesses. 
  4. Analysis of the dynamics of morbidity has revealed a 
genuine change of morbidity with respect to a number of separate 
nosological units both toward an increase, and toward a decrease. 
  5. The dynamics of the integral measure of deviation of 
morbidity with respect to the totality of nosological units from 
the initial (1985) state is markedly nonlinear. An assessment of 
the direction of these changes shows that they are negative on 
the whole: in the period following 1986, there is an increase in 
morbidity, especially dramatic in 1986-1988, with some reduction 
of the increase in morbidity and stabilization in 1990. 
  6. ``Splitting'' of the totality of illnesses into a group 
with positive dynamics and a group with negative dynamics is 
consistent with the concept of integrated action of factors of 
the habitat on the organism as a hierarchical structure of 
mutually regulated subsystems, and may serve as an argument 
supporting this concept. 
  7. The time dependence of the integral index of 
directionality of correlations between different illnesses shows 
extremum behavior. The position of the maximum in 1986-1987 
gives evidence of the important contribution of the radiation 
component to the observed changes of morbidity. 
  8. Our approach allows an integral assessment of the state 
of 
health of the population of regions, tracking of dynamics, and 
establishment of a relation between the state of health and the 
degree of radiation contamination, which opens the way to 
demarcation of territories of elevated risk and development of 
purposeful and effective protective measures.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan possesses a developed electric power 
system which fully meets the needs of the republic's economy for 
electric power and which transmits one-third of its production 
to the consolidated power grid of Central Asia and southern 
Kazakhstan. 
  The power system incorporates 20 power stations with a total 
installed capacity of 3,384 MW including 18 hydroelectric plants 
(2,710 MW) and two heat and power plants in Bishkek and Osh (674 
MW). Other large power stations are the Toktogul hydroelectric 
plant (1,200 MW), Kurpsay hydroelectric plant (800 MW), Bishkek 
heat and power plant (624 MW), Tash-Kumyr hydroelectric plant 
(450 MW), and Uch-Kurgan hydroelectric plant (180 MW).

  The power system's electric networks contain 500-kV aerial 
power transmission lines (VL) extending 541 km, 1,009 km of 
220-kV lines, 4,301 km of 110-kV lines, and 4,172 km of 35-kV 
lines and more than 60,000 km of 10-0.4-kV distribution lines. 
There are 481 35-500-kV step-down transformer substations with a 
total capacity of 7,787 MVA. 
  The power system is involved in central heat supply in the 
cities of Bishkek, Osh, Kara-Kol, Kyzyl-Kiya, and Kara-Kul. The 
total length of thermal networks is 460 km. The power system's 
heat sources annually produce 5,500-5,700 thousand Gcal or 
39% 
of the thermal energy consumed in the republic. 
  In 1992, the power system generated 12.1 billion kWh of 
electric power of which 9.4 billion were at hydroelectric plants 
and 2.7 billion--at heat and power stations. Furthermore, the 
electric power consumption by the economy and population of the 
Kyrgyzstan republic amounted to 9.7 billion kWh, while 6 billion 
kWh were supplied to the consolidated power grid (OES) and the 
People's Republic of China. On the other hand, 3.6 billion kWh 
were received from the consolidated power grid resulting in a 
transfer balance of 2.4 billion kWh.

  The industry is switching to new economic management 
conditions in a difficult situation which is typical of the 
economy as a whole. The principal problem which complicates 
execution of the campaign is the objective need for periodically 
increasing the electric and heat power rates. The difficult user 
adaptation to the new pricing policy and their financial 
insolvency and a lack of a clearly defined economic and legal 
framework for governing the relations among the producers and 
consumers of energy cause instability in the electric power 
industry performance. 
  The principal factors which determine the trends, scale, and 
pace of the electric power system development are as follows: 
  availability of the energy resources converted to electric 
and thermal power; 
  meeting the economy's requirements for electric and thermal 
power for domestic need and export; and 
  financing and physical base support of capital construction 
and overhaul of electric power industry installations. 
  Hydroelectric power resources are the backbone for 
developing 
the electric power base of Kyrgyzstan. According to geological 
survey data, the total hydroelectric power potential of rivers 
in the Kyrgyzstan republic reaches 142.5 billion kWh.

  According to analyses by the Gidroproyekt Hydroelectric 
Power 
Plant Design Institute, a total of 95 hydroelectric power plants 
with a total capacity of 11,350 MW and an average multiyear 
generation of 49.8 billion kWh may be built on Kyrgyzstan rivers. 
  At today's development stage, only 9% of 
hydroelectric 
resources have been mastered. Hydroelectric power construction 
is carried out primarily on the Naryn River. The development of 
the electric power industry in the foreseeable future is 
associated with mastering this river and its tributaries. 
  The plans for the power utilization of Kyrgyzstan rivers 
have 
been developed in sufficient detail, and today, there are 
several versions of hydroelectric power construction with 
economic and technical feasibility. 
  A positive feature characterizing the development of 
hydroelectric power in Kyrgyzstan is the possibility of building 
hydroelectric power plant cascades which utilize more fully the 
river resources and increase the degree of control. 
  An optimization of the electric power plant development and 
siting made it possible to determine the most efficient ways of 
commissioning the generating capacities in the power system up 
to the year 2010 (Table 2). 
  After completion of the Lower Naryn hydroelectric power 
plant 
cascade, plans call for building five hydroelectric power plant 
cascades in the upper and midsections of the Naryn River and its 
tributaries which include 19 hydroelectric power plants with a 
5,400-MW power and a 16.8 billion kWh generation in 2010. 
  Construction of the GES-2 Kambartin hydroelectric power 
plant 
with a 360-MW capacity and 1.1 billion kWh/yr generation began 
in 1991. At the same time, preliminary work and construction of 
the Kambartin GES-1 hydroelectric power plant with a planned 
1,900-MW power and an annual electric power output of 4.5 
billion kWh have begun; it will be fully commissioned by 2005. 
Construction and commissioning of the Kambartin GES-3 
hydroelectric power plant with a planned power of 170 MW would 
be expedient in 1996-2005. Kambartin hydroelectric power plants 
will operate in a power mode since the availability of the 
Toktogul reservoir downstream frees them from any irrigation 
constraints. 
  Plans for 2001-2010 call for building the Ala-Bukin 
hydroelectric power plant with a 600-MW design power in the 
midsection of the Naryn River and the Kara-Bulun plant with a 
120-MW power in 2006-2010. 
  Preparatory work on the Upper Naryn hydroelectric power 
plant 
cascade will begin in 1993 while construction of the principal 
structures--in 1995 with subsequent commissioning of five 
hydroelectric power plants in the cascade before 2005 with a 
total power of 291 MW. 
  The republic's small hydroelectric power plants could make a 
significant contribution to electric power generation. The total 
hydroelectric power potential of small rivers with rates of flow 
between 0.7 and 50 m[.sup]3[/]/s is estimated as 7.0 billion 
kWh/yr. Its utilization will make it possible to supply electric 
power to installations in distant pastures and for highland 
agriculture. 
  Today, only 3% of the possible hydroelectric 
resources of 
small rivers have been utilized in the republic. The irrigation 
reservoir and numerous canal and river resources are not being 
utilized for generating electric power. In order to accelerate 
the development of small-scale hydroelectric industry in the 
republic, plans call for building new and rebuilding small 
hydroelectric power plants with a total power of 178 MW and 
annual production of approximately 0.5 billion kWh.

  The above electric power plant development strategy will 
enable Kyrgyzstan to become a large producer of electric power 
at the turn of the century. 
  Moreover, electric power generation and the electric power 
plant capacity will double and reach 25.6 billion kWh and 7,800 
MW, respectively. 
  Gas-fired 720-MW TETs-2 heat and power generating plants 
will 
be constructed in Bishkek before 2010 in order to meet the 
demand for thermal and electric power, and first phase 
generating capacities--a peak load boiler--will be commissioned 
prior to 1994. The first generating unit with a 180-MW power 
will be commissioned in 1997. 
  Given the proposed electric power production and 
distribution 
scope, subsequent electric power supply system development for 
meeting the electric power requirements will become an important 
link in the power system. 
  The development of 220-500 kV electric networks will be 
dictated by the need to enhance electric power supply to the 
developing industrial centers, agricultural facilities, and 
municipal and domestic users in the need to accommodate 
generating capacities of the new large power plants. 
  The principal network installations to be built during 
1995-2010 include a 500-kV transmission line with the following 
500-kV substations (PS): the Kambartin hydroelectric power plant 
with the Kemin substation, the Kambartin hydroelectric power 
plant with the Kyrgyz substation in Osh oblast, and the Frunze 
substation with the Kemin substation which are used both to 
distribution power from the Kambartin hydroelectric power plants 
and for enhancing the links between the southern and northern 
parts of the power system. 
  The scope of the network construction and overhaul up to the 
year 2010 allowing that the planned hydroelectric power plants 
will generate power are summarized in Table 4. 
  The electric power distribution in the republic during 
1992-2010 will continue to utilize the formula 110/35/10-6/0.4 
and 110/10-6/0.4 kV. 
  Electrification is regarded as one of the objectives and an 
important means of implementing Kyrgyzstan's new energy policy. 
  The primary goal of its subsequent accelerated development 
is 
to maximize participation in standardizing and then subsequently 
greater improving the living conditions of the population. This 
will call for expanding the use of electric power in everyday 
life and the sphere of social services. 
  The second objective of accelerating the development of 
electrification is to enhance its participation in increasing 
the production sphere efficiency and increasing the national 
economic resources which result in invigorating the republic's 
economy. 
  It is expected that industrial electric power consumption 
will continue to decrease in 1993-1994; in addition to the 
declining volume of electric power generation, a continuing 
increase in the electric power cost which stimulates an increase 
in the electric power consumption efficiency will also have 
their impact. The economy is expected to pick up eventually, and 
some of it will be due to an increase in the electric 
power-to-worker ratio which will lead to an increase in electric 
power consumption. Nevertheless, a rather moderate rate of 
industrial electric power consumption growth is predicted 
allowing for energy conservation. Furthermore, the proportion of 
industry in the total electric power demand will decrease from 
37.2% in 1992 to 29% in 2005. 
  Roughly the same trends will characterize the electric power 
consumption for agricultural needs. At the level of 2,000, this 
category of users will consume one-fifth of the total electric 
power demand in the republic. 
  The anticipated substantial shifts in the electric power 
consumption structure will occur due to a deliberate accelerated 
development of electrification of the daily life of the 
population by implementing energy-intensive heating appliances 
in residences. A stage-by-stage increase in the number of such 
heating appliances will be responsible for an increase in the 
proportion of domestic thermal processes in the total electric 
power consumption of up to 20-30% after 2000. At the same 
time, 
the electric power consumption for traditional household needs 
will also increase. This electric power consumption is 
tentatively estimated as 11.8 billion kWh in 1995 and 17.4 
billion kWh in 2000.

Scientific Production Company and State Enterprise of the 
National Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power 
Industry, Moscow] 
  [Text] The total production of the fuel and energy 
resources in 1990-1992 declined primarily due to a decrease in 
the coal and oil production. The lack of technical readiness to 
extract oil from the ground using more complicated practices 
precludes attempts at stabilizing or even increasing somewhat 
the oil production in the next 30-40 years. Coal production will 
increase yet it will be utilized primarily near the mining 
locations--in Russia's eastern regions--due to the difficulty of 
delivering it to the western regions. An increase in the gas 
production should be treated as an important yet 
difficult-to-meet goal. The planned nuclear power development 
scale would hardly make it possible to complete Russia's fuel 
balance. 
  Such a situation necessitates a search for new energy 
sources. In recent decades, scientists in Russia and abroad 
focused attention on the possibility of utilizing the heat 
released during the splitting of the so-called 
high-molecular silicates 
M[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]_x_SiO[.sub]2[/] type, where M=Na 
or K and _x_=3 or 4, e.g., the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] silicate. In this 
case, anhydrous silicon compounds of the SiR type, where R=C or 
N may serve as the splitting substance, e.g., a mixture of 
silicon carbide and nitride SiC + Si[.sup]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. 
  The fission process may occur in two ways: the first is the 
conventional chemical reaction which is characterized 
by the interaction of material particles; the 
second--physical-chemical chain reaction--which is 
determined by the level of the material-energy reaction chains. 
A chain reaction may develop only in the case where the energy 
released during the occurrence of the preceding reaction is 
sufficient to start the next one. Academician A.N. Semenov 
characterized these type of reactions as the development of a 
chain process by means of energy chains. 
  The fission process occurs until the development of the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] low-modulus 
silicate and CO and SiO carbon and silicon monoxide. According 
to the general theory of chain reactions, the presence of active 
silicate complexes and energy chains alone is insufficient to 
ensure a chain process. The crucial feature is the presence of 
the so-called critical mass of the silicate. Not all 
silicates can break up by the chain mechanism. In a number of 
silicates, the necessary initial energy in the initial state is 
consolidated only partially, so it must be additionally 
consolidated artificially from the initial substances. For 
example, in producing the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] silicate from the 
original products, i.e., sodium carbonate and sand: 
  (1)Na[.sup]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/] + 3SiO[.sub]2[/] = 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
CO[.sup]2[/]. 
  This process is widely known and is utilized in the 
glass-making industry. 
  The quantity of energy released during fission is calculated 
from the following formula [1, 2] 
  (2)Q = 
k[.sup]i[/][.sup].[/]10[.sup]3n[/], 
  where k is the indicator of the fuel type and 
purity and n is the coefficient of the chain reaction 
order; for the hydration process, n = 0, for a 
chemical reaction, n = 1, for a physical-chemical 
reaction, n = 2, for a nuclear reaction, n 
= 3, and for a fusion reaction, n = 4. 
  Analyses show that in the course of a purely chemical 
decomposition reaction, 1 kg of silicate releases 3,350 cal of 
heat [2], which is the same as Ekibastuz coal, while in a chain 
physical-chemical reaction, it releases 8.5 million kcal, i.e., 
in this case, it may replace 1,000 t of fuel oil. 
  Physical-chemical silicate chain reactions amount to a phase 
transformation during the process. At first, the high-modulus 
silicate is in the solid phase. To trigger its decomposition 
process, it is necessary to supply a relatively small quantity 
of initial energy from outside. As a result, it will be 
partially converted to the liquid phase, and the chain reaction 
will begin to develop. 
  Given a total transition of the critical silicate mass to 
the 
liquid state, reaction byproducts and energy are released 
abruptly (at a rate of an explosion). One can retard the energy 
release only by adding to the molten silicate mass special rods 
from anhydrous silicate compounds and withdrawing them. 
Insertion of the rods increases the energy chain multiplication 
factor, while their withdrawal decreases it. 
  The energy released in the devices as a result of the 
high-modulus silicate splitting under the effect of anhydrous 
silicon compounds may be broadly utilized virtually in all 
branches of the national economy with the help of a conventional 
heat exchange circuit using well-known designs. The gain from 
the transition to silicate fuel is indisputable. For example, we 
know that 39 t of liquid fuel are pumped into the tanks of the 
TU-154 airplane, yet the same energy can be derived from 39 kg 
of silicate. 
  Silicate fuel is inexpensive, and approximately 1.5 million 
t 
of it is produced annually in Russia. In the power industry, 
silicate power plants could be installed in place of boiler 
plants at thermal electric power plants and large boiler rooms. 
This is a new environmentally clean type of fuel, which is 
especially desirable for heat and power generating plants with a 
combined heat and electricity production as well as large urban 
boiler rooms located in residential construction and suburban 
areas. 
  The high-modulus silicate decay products, i.e., CO and SiO, 
are not discharged into the atmosphere but are forwarded to a 
special recovery module. In this module, carbon monoxide is 
converted to carbon dioxide, while silicon monoxide--into 
silicon dioxide. These substances are used for silicate recovery: 
  (3)Na[.sup]2[/])[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
2SiO[.sup]2[/] = 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/]. 
  The thermal pollution of the atmosphere is also greatly 
decreased, i.e., 
  Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
2SiO[.sup]2[/] = Na [sic] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-86A>           Schematic Diagram of a Power Plant Using New Energy Source with a Gaseous Energy Source </FIG>




  A schematic diagram of a power plant with a gaseous energy 
source is shown in the figure. In contrast to boiler furnaces, 
heat transfer in the water wall tubes is realized due to heat 
transfer from the more-heated medium to the less-heated medium 
through the pipe walls rather than due to radiative transport 
from the fuel combustion flare. 
  Silicate power engineering is still in its infancy. Today, 
the State Association of the National Scientific Research and 
Design Institute of Power Industry together with the Energy 
Physics Institute (Obninsk) and the Gidropress Special Hydraulic 
Press Design Office (Podolsk) are developing the design of a 
pilot silicate power plant with a 25 MW power with 6 MPa and 
275ÎC heat transfer agent parameters. Shop drawings of the 
pilot-commercial power plant using the new energy source have 
been prepared and its assembly is in the finishing stages.

<F P=106> [Text of "Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties </F>
in Russian Federation"; first paragraph is italic SELEKTSIYA I 
SEMENOVODSTVO introduction] 
  [Text] We are presenting 
for your attention the "Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant 
Varieties in Russian Federation," which has been approved by the 
Ministry of Agriculture. It was developed with consideration for 
the concept of the draft of the ``Law Regarding Selection 
Improvements Whose Adoption Is Eagerly Awaited by Breeders.'' In 
view of the fact that some genera and species of agricultural 
crops will not be subject to the Law for a certain period, the 
Statute published here will regulate relations arising during 
the creation and use of new varieties of these crops. 
<H3>  Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties in the 
Russian Federation </H3>
  This Statute specifies the procedure for government testing 
of plant varieties for the purpose of scientifically 
substantiated formation of the variety resources of the Russian 
Federation and regulates relations arising in connection with 
the creation and use of new varieties. 
  The Statute is in effect until the passage and effective 
date 
of the Russian Federation Law Regarding Selection Improvements. 
<H5>  I. General Provisions </H5>
  1.1. Government tests of new varieties, hybrids, and lines 
of 
agricultural crops and other cultivated plants and silkworm 
breeds and hybrids (henceforth referred to as varieties) are 
conducted by the All-Russian State Commission on Agricultural 
Crop Variety Testing (henceforth referred to as the 
Gossortkomissiya) through the following: 

  -  republic, kray, and oblast inspectors to test varieties of 
agricultural crops (henceforth referred to as inspectors); 
  -  government variety-testing stations (henceforth referred to 
as 
gossortstantsii); 
  -  government variety-testing sections located on an independent 
balance sheet or organizational variety-testing sections on a 
contractual basis in agricultural enterprises under different 
forms of ownership (henceforth referred to as gossortouchastki); 
  -  the All-Russia Center for Quality Evaluation of Agricultural 
Crop Varieties [VTsOKS]; 
  -  regional chemical technology laboratories (henceforth 
referred 
to as laboratories); 
  -  other organizations on a contractual basis. 

    1.2. The Gossortkomissiya, in accordance with this Statute, 
will assume the examination of variety applications, conduct an 
expert examination of them and test the varieties, manage the 
State Register of Varieties Authorized for Use in Production in 
the Corresponding Region of the Russian Federation (henceforth 
referred to as the State Register), issue certificates and 
authorship certificates, publish rules clarifying the use of 
this Statute and the government's variety-testing method, 
publish official information, and perform other functions in 
accordance with the applicable statutes. 
  1.3. Inclusion of a variety in the State Register grants the 
right to reproduce, import, and sell seeds and plant material of 
a variety in territories of the republics, krays, and oblasts of 
a respective region. Crops of these varieties are subjected to 
testing, and variety documents are issued for them. 
  Reproduction of seeds and plant material of a variety for 
purposes of their export beyond the confines of its respective 
region does not require inclusion of the variety in the State 
Register for the given region. 
  1.4. For a variety included in the State Register, the 
Gossortkomissiya issues a certificate to the applicant and an 
authorship certificate to the developer. 
  1.5. State testing of plant varieties is financed with the 
resources of the republic budget of the Russian Federation. 
<H5>  II. The State Register </H5>
  2.1. The State Register includes varieties permitted for use 
during that year in the respective region of the Russian 
Federation (Appendix). 
  2.2. In the case of crops on the list specified by the 
Gossortkomissiya, inclusion of varieties in the State Register 
is based on government tests; in the case of all other crops, 
inclusion is based on expert evaluations or studies conducted by 
the applicant. 
  Varieties regionalized in the Russian Federation as of the 
approval date of this Statute are included in the State Register 
de facto. 
  2.3. The following varieties are excluded from the State 
Register of Varieties: 
varieties that have lost their agricultural value, homogeneity, 
or stability; 
seeds (plant material) that are not in demand and have not been 
used in the production of the respective region for the past 5 
years. 
  2.4. When the reasons prompting exclusion of a variety from 
the State Register have been eliminated, the originator has the 
right to send the Gossortkomissiya a petition requesting that 
the variety be reinstated in the State Register after the 
appropriate tests. 
  2.5. Revisions in the State Register and lists of the 
following are approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Agriculture upon the recommendation of the Gossortkomissiya: 

  -  varieties of hardy wheat; 
  -  varieties of grain, cereal, and leguminous crops that are 
valuable from a quality standpoint; 
  -  varieties of brewing barley; 
  -  high-oil varieties of sunflower; 
  -  erucic acid-free and low-glucosinolate varieties of rape and 
summer rape. 

<H5>    III. The Certificate </H5>
  3.1. The certificate certifies the originator of the variety 
and grants him the right to conclude agreements to produce the 
seeds (plant material) and sell them, as well as to otherwise 
introduce the variety into economic circulation in accordance 
with the State Register. 
  In the event that a certificate for a variety is issued to 
several applicants who have jointly created the variety, the 
relationships regarding use of the variety in production is 
regulated by an agreement among them. 
  3.2. A certificate shall remain in effect for 20 years from 
the date of its issue. In the case of grapes and decorative and 
fruit tree varieties, including their rootstock, this period 
shall constitute 25 years. 
  3.3. The holder of a certificate is obliged to maintain the 
variety so as to preserve the traits specified in the 
description of the variety on the priority date, its 
homogeneity, and its stability and is, upon the request of the 
Gossortkomissiya, obliged to send them at his own expense seeds 
of the variety for check tests and to permit on-site inspections 
when necessary. 
<H5>  IV. The Authorship Certificate </H5>
  4.1. The authorship certificate certifies the authorship of 
a 
variety and priority and grants the developer the right to 
receive authorship royalties from the holder of the certificate 
based on an agreement with him for as long as funds are received 
as a result of use of the variety in production. 
  The royalties to a team of developers are distributed in 
proportion to the extent of each developer's participation in 
creation of the variety. 
  4.2. The physical individual whose creative labor has either 
created or discovered a variety may be the developer of that 
variety. Disputes regarding authorship are resolved in a 
judicial procedure. 
  4.3. The period for which an authorship certificate remains 
in effect is unlimited. 
<H5>  V. Handling of an Application </H5>
  5.1. The breeder submits an application for inclusion of the 
variety in the State Register and issuance of a certificate and 
authorship certificate to the Gossortkomissiya. In the case of a 
variety created while the breeder is performing his job or job 
duties, the application is submitted by the originating 
institution. 
  5.2. The application should include the following: 

  -  a request to have the variety included in the State 
Register for the corresponding region and to issue a certificate 
and authorship certificate; 
  -  a description of the variety with its proposed name; 
  -  information regarding the creative participation of each of 
the 
developers of the new variety that has been signed by all of the 
developers; 
  -  the obligation to provide the required amount of seeds (plant 
material) of the variety free of charge. 

    The documents of the application should be provided in 
Russian in accordance with the form established by the 
Gossortkomissiya. 
  5.3. If the applicant is an originating institution, the 
presence of an agreement with the developer of the variety 
should be indicated in the application. 
  5.4. An applicant has the right to priority of first 
application 12 months from the date of receipt of the first 
application by another government. 
  In this case, the applicant should indicate the date of 
priority of first application in the application sent to the 
Gossortkomissiya, and within 6 months of the date of receipt of 
the application, he should present the Gossortkomissiya with a 
copy of the first application verified by a competent agency of 
the respective government along with a Russian translation of it. 
  5.5. In order for government tests of a variety to be 
conducted during the next growing season, an application must be 
received no later than the date established by the 
Gossortkomissiya. 
<H5>  VI. Naming of a Variety </H5>
  6.1. The variety is given the name proposed by the applicant 
and approved by the Gossortkomissiya. 
  6.2. The name of a variety should make it possible to 
identify the variety, be brief, and be different from any other 
name of an existing variety or closely related botanical 
species. The name must not consist of numbers alone; it must not 
contradict the principles of public morals; and it must not lead 
to confusion regarding the nature of the properties, origin, and 
significance of the variety or the identity of the breeder. 
  6.3. The name of a variety should be the same in the event 
that applications for its registration are submitted to the 
Russian Federation and other governments. 
  6.4. A name not meeting the requirements in items 6.2 and 
6.3 
must, upon the recommendation of the Gossortkomissiya, be 
changed within the specified time period. 
<H5>  VII. Expert Examination of an Application </H5>
  7.1. The Gossortkomissiya will conduct its expert 
examination 
within a month. The priority date is established, and the 
documents submitted with the application are checked for their 
conformity to the stipulated requirements. 
  7.2. The Gossortkomissiya may request missing documents or 
verifying materials, which the applicant is obliged to provide 
in the established time period. The application is not 
considered otherwise, and the applicant is informed of this fact. 
  7.3. In the event of an affirmative decision, the applicant 
is informed that his variety has been accepted for government 
testing or that an expert examination of the variety has been 
set. In the case of varieties demonstrating clearly 
unsatisfactory results in the applicant's field tests, the 
application is rejected. 
<H5>  VIII. Government Tests </H5>
  8.1. The government testing includes the following: 

  -  a biological-economic evaluation of the variety at 
government variety-testing stations and sections in the region; 
  -  an immunologic evaluation at special government 
variety-testing

  [Text]The influenza epidemics in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990 are 
characterized according to age groups. It was shown that two of 
the six epidemics were caused by serotype B influenza viruses 
and four, by influenza A virus. 
  Influenza and ORZ [acute respiratory diseases] strike 
primarily the child population. For this reason, it is 
imperative to improve registration of incidence of ORVI [acute 
respiratory viral infection] in children. The lack of such 
registration makes it difficult to pinpoint promptly the start 
of a flu epidemic due to their small share of the overall 
population. For this reason, we kept a differentiated record of 
incidence of influenza and ORZ in different age groups during 
the flue epidemic in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990. 
  In 1985, an epidemic rise in incidence of influenza among 
children began in the 46th week of the year (11-17 November) in 
the 3-6 year age group. The following week (18-24 November) the 
epidemic threshold was exceeded by morbidity among 
schoolchildren 7-14 years old with a high rate of rise (to 40.3 
percent). The epidemic flu outbreak among children was 
characterized by low intensity, and it lasted for 6 weeks. In 
this period, morbidity constituted 5.2 percent for children in 
the 3-6 year age group, and 1.9 percent for children 7-14 years 
old, which was not appreciably reflected in the incidence of 
influenza in the adult population (Table 1).

  Within the epidemic period a total of 80 nasopharyngeal 
washings and 71 paired serum samples from patients with the 
diagnosis of influenza and acute respiratory disease were 
examined. Two strains of influenza virus were isolated from 
material from a sick 3-year old child and 59-year adult; 
identification with prototype sera revealed that they were of 
the sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza virus. Immunological analysis 
carried out with a large set of immune rat serum samples 
revealed that they were closely related to the drift variant 
A/Chile/1/83 (H1N1). HIT [hemagglutination inhibition tests] on 
paired patient serum samples revealed an increase in titers of 
antibodies to influenza virus A(H1N1) in 14.1 percent of the 
cases, to virus A(H3N2) in 5.6 percent, to virus B in 7.0 
percent, and mixed influenza infection in 9.9 percent. When the 
tested patients were distributed in age groups, influenza was 
diagnosed in 37.5 percent of the children 3-6 years old and 22.2 
percent in those 7-14 years old (Table 2).

  [Text]We noted an epidemic rise 
in incidence of influenza among Alma-Ata children 7-14 years old 
at an increment rate of 38.4 percent in the 5th week of 1986 (27 
January -- 2 February). One week later, children 3-6 years old 
were included in the epidemic process with an increment rate of 
41.4 percent. However, overall incidence of influenza among the 
entire population of the city remained below the epidemic 
threshold at this time. This indicator exceeded its limits only 
3 weeks after the start of the epidemic. The flu epidemic lasted 
7 weeks, and at its peak 0.9 percent of the population was 
stricken. In this period, 19.9 percent of preschool children 
were involved, 12.0 percent of schoolchildren and 1.3 percent of 
adults. As a result, over the entire epidemic, 4.7 percent of 
the city's inhabitants had contracted influenza (see Table 1). 
  As a result of virological tests performed in the first 
quarter of 1986, 3 strains of influenza virus B were isolated 
from 182 nasopharyngeal washings from patients (see Table 2). 
Two strains were isolated from children 21 months and 10 years 
old, and the third from a 34-year adult. The isolated strains 
were closely related according to antigenic structure of 
hemagglutinin to influenza virus B/Victoria/1/85, and they were 
characterized by loss of relationship to virus 
B/Singapore/222/79. Serological testing of paired serum samples 
from patients identified influenza B in 23.2 percent of the 
cases, A(H3N2) in 7.7 percent, and A(H1N1) in 1.6 percent. Mixed 
influenza infection was diagnosed in 4.1 percent. On the whole, 
influenza was demonstrated in 37.1 percent of the tested 
individuals. Serological testing of age groups revealed 
influenza in 21.2 percent of children up to 2 years old, 10.0 
percent in those 3-6 years of age, 46.6 percent of children 7-14 
years old, and 42.1 percent of adults. 
  In the 4th quarter of 1986, epidemic influenza in Alma-Ata 
was characterized by involvement of all age groups (see Table 
1). Rapid rates of increase in morbidity were recorded among 
schoolchildren (39.1 percent) and adults (35.1 percent). A 
dramatic rise in morbidity was noted in the 2d and 3d weeks 
after the start of the influenza epidemic. Peak epidemic 
morbidity occurred 2 weeks after onset of the epidemic in 
infants (0-2 years) and schoolchildren (7-14 years), whereas it 
occurred 3 weeks after the start in children 3-6 years old and 
adults. The flu epidemic lasted 6 weeks in the city. In this 
time, 2.1 percent of infants to 2 years old, 10.1 percent of 
3-6-year children, 10.3 percent of those 7-14 years old and 2.7 
percent of the adults had been stricken with the flu. Morbidity 
among children 3-14 years of age exceed that of adults by 3.8 
times during this flue epidemic. 
  A total of 176 patients were submitted to virological 
testing 
in order to make laboratory identification of the etiology of 
influenza during the epidemic. We isolated three strains of 
influenza virus A(H1N1) from children and one identical strain 
from an adult. According to antigenic structure of 
hemagglutinin, the epidemic viruses were closely related to the 
drift variant A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1). The hemagglutination 
neutralization test with antibody erythrocyte diagnosticum to 
strain A/Taiwan/1/86 showed that isolates interacted to a full 
homologous titer (1:5120), with A/Prague/1/84 to one-half titer, 
and to A/USSR/090/77 to one-eighth titer. Serologically, 
influenza A(H1N1) was demonstrated in 20.3 percent of those 
tested and mixed influenza infection was found in 3.2 percent. 
On the whole, influenza was diagnosed in 29.7 percent of the 
tested cases. 
  Thus, in the first and fourth quarters of 1986, there were 2 
flu epidemics in Alma-Ata, which were caused by serotype B and 
sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza viruses. The distinction of these 
epidemics was predominant involvement of preschool and school 
age children. 
  In the winter-spring period of 1987-1988, epidemic influenza 
morbidity in Alma-Ata had a two-wave course, and was 
characterized by dissimilar involvement of inhabitants in 
different age groups. At the start, in the 50th week of 1987 
(7-13 December), the epidemic threshold was exceeded by 
schoolchildren, and after 3 weeks preschool children were 
involved in the epidemic process. Among younger children, the 
epidemic lasted 5 weeks, and in this time 6.7 percent of the 
children up to 2 years old and 8.8 percent of those 3-6 years of 
age were stricken. The epidemic had a continuous pattern in 
children 7-14 years of age, and 15.6 percent of them were 
stricken. The distinction of this epidemic was the fact that the 
adult population of the city was virtually uninvolved in the 
epidemic process. On the whole, 2.5 percent of the inhabitants 
of Alma-Ata were stricken with influenza during the epidemic. 
  In the first wave of rise in incidence of influenza 
(December 
1987), we examined 159 nasopharyngeal washings from patients and 
isolated 2 strains of influenza virus B. HIT of 89 paired serum 
samples from stricken individuals revealed influenza B in 8.8 
percent of the cases, A(H1N1) in 3.5 percent, and A(H3N) in 2.2 
percent. In 10 percent of the cases, we diagnosed influenza 
infection of mixed etiology. During the period of the second 
rise in incidence of influenza (1st quarter of 1988), 22 strains 
of the virus sero-subtype A(H3N2) were isolated from material 
taken from 414 patients. The strains were characterized by 
marked antigenic heterogeneity. One strain showed great 
resemblance to the standard A/Si-Chwan/2/87, others to 
A/Mississippi/1/85, and others yet to A/Philippines/2/82. HIT of 
181 paired serum samples of patients demonstrated diagnostic 
rise in antibody titer to virus A(H3N2) in 18.2 percent of the 
cases, to A(H1N1) in 2.2 percent, and to B in 3.3 percent. In 
March, testing of 69 pairs of blood serum samples revealed an 
increase to 17.4 percent in seroconversions to influenza B 
virus. During the period of epidemic rise in influenza, 
serologically we established microcirculation of relic strains 
of influenza A(H2N2) virus and A(H0N1) to 4.0 percent, as well 
as active circulation of other groups of respiratory viruses: 
parainfluenza, RS virus, and adenovirus, the share of which 
ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 percent. 
  In 1989, the epidemic rise in incidence of influenza in 
Alma-Ata started among 4-14-year school children in the 4th week 
of the year (16-22 January). Two weeks later, the flu epidemic 
struck preschool children 3-6 years of age and adults. The 
epidemic lasted in the city for 7 weeks, and in this period 12.8 
percent of the children 3-6 years old were stricken, 17.3 
percent of those 7-14 years old and 1.1 percent of adults. On 
the whole, 4.2 percent of the city's inhabitants were stricken 
with the flu during the epidemic. The distinction of this 
epidemic was also predominant involvement of the child 
population; however, the youngest age group (0-2 years old) was 
not involved in the flu epidemic process. 
  During the epidemic period, we examined virologically 364 
samples of nasopharyngeal washings. We isolated 10 
hemagglutinating agents, 6 of which were referable to influenza 
A(H1N1) virus, 1 to A(H3N2), 1 to B, and 2 isolates were a 
mixture of serovariants A(H1N1) and A(HSW1N1). Strains of 
A(H1N1) showed antigenic resemblance to standard viruses 
A/Prague/1/84 and A/Taiwan/1/86, and were neutralized by immune 
sera to these viruses to a full and half homologous titer, 
respectively. HIT of 151 paired serum samples from patients 
revealed diagnostic increase in titers of antigens to A(H1N1) in 
8.0 percent of the cases, to B in 11.2 percent, to A(H3N2) in 
2.0 percent, and mixed influenza infection was found in 4.6 
percent. 
  In January 1990, there was a new epidemic rise in influenza 
in Alma-Ata. Unlike the preceding epidemics, it began among the 
adult population in the 2d week of the year (8-14 January), and 
a week later children became involved in the epidemic. Maximum 
incidence of influenza was recorded only 3 weeks after the start 
of the epidemic, when 2.5 percent of the inhabitants were 
involved. On the whole, the epidemic lasted in the city for 6 
weeks, and 4.7 percent of the inhabitants were stricken. Also, 
in the period of the epidemic, 1.5 percent of children up to 2 
years old, 11.4 percent of those 3-6 years old, 12.9 percent of 
those 7-14 years of age and 2.4 percent of adults were stricken 
with the flu. These findings indicate that in this epidemic too, 
morbidity among preschool and schoolchildren exceeded that of 
adults by 5.5 times (see Table 1). 
  Virological examination of 293 samples of nasopharyngeal 
washings in the 1st quarter of 1990 resulted in isolation of 8 
strains of influenza A(H3N2) virus, 4 of which were isolated 
form children up to 14 years of age and the other 4, from 
adults. The etiology of the epidemic was confirmed by 
serological testing of 182 paired blood serum samples from 
patients with the flu. Thus, influenza A(H3N2) was documented in 
28.6 percent of the tested individuals. 
  Thus, in 1985-1990, there were 6 recorded influenza 
epidemics 
in Alma-Ata, 2 of which were caused by influenza virus serotype 
B (1986, 1987) and the other 4, by influenza A virus. In 
particular, there was prevalence among the public of strains of 
variants of A(H1N1) in 1985, 1986 and 1989, and of influenza 
A(H3N2) virus in 1988 and 1990.

  [Text] The operation of existing and 
the construction of new equipment for producing microbial 
synthesis products is currently giving rise to sharp social 
protest in connection with environmental contamination by 
microorganism cells in the gas emissions of these industries 
that cause acute respiratory diseases in humans. 
  The specifics of producing the majority of microbial 
synthesis products, including the production of feed proteins, 
involve the fact that during their growth process, 
microorganisms utilize oxygen, the source of which is, as a 
rule, air, which is released to the atmosphere after it has 
passed through the reactor. 
  The traditional scheme for producing microbial synthesis 
products includes a bioreactor (fermenter), air processing 
equipment, and equipment for purifiying the gas exiting the 
reactor. 
  Air processing equipment is intended for purifying gas of 
solid and harmful gaseous contaminants, compressing and 
condensing air, separating condensed moisture, and sterilization. 
  Equipment for purifying gas exiting the reactor is intended 
for trapping aerosols. As a rule, wet or dry filters are used 
for this. However, wet filters have a low purification 
effectiveness, and dry fabric filters, while they are relatively 
highly effective, have a high hydraulic resistance and require 
frequent regeneration or filter element changes, which makes it 
impossible to maintain sterility in the production space. 
  Due to the large volume of air that passes through the 
reactor per unit time (5000 - 3 m[.sup]3[/]/hr), which 
results in a low level of oxygen removal from the air (no 
greater than 15%), and the need to mix the liquid medium, 
equipment for processing and purifying air is significantly 
large. 
  In such a manner, the creation of ecologically pure 
technology allows one to overcome problems that have arisen and 
to give new momentum to the development of microbial synthesis. 
  The basic principle of creating ecological pure technologies 
lies in organizing a closed cycle, which is accomplished by 
capturing the carbon dioxide evolved in the reactor by means of 
sorption methods and returning the purfied gas to the reactor 
after adding the required amount of oxygen to it. 
  In this case, total oxygen utilization is achieved, whereas 
in a traditional apparatus, losses of oxygenated air are 
unavoidable, which leads to high air and energy consumption. The 
absorption of carbon dioxide from spent gas can be accomplished 
by chemical or physical sorption. In this case, the need for 
equipment to process air and biologically purify it after exit 
from the reactor drops. 
  A diagram of the equipment that carry out an ecologically 
pure method for producing microbial synthesis products with the 
application of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gas 
after its use in the reactor is presented in fig. 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-95A>           Fig. 1. Diagram of equipment with the application of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide. </FIG>




  Such a method for organizing the purification of spent gas 
leads to additional costs associated with chemisorbent 
consumption and the need to reprocess or neutralize reaction 
products. 
  Organization of the closed cycle with the application of 
physical sorption of carbon dioxide assumes regeneration of the 
absorber (monoethanolamine) and generation of carbon dioxide, 
which is widely used in various industrial sectors. A diagram of 
equipment intended for producing microbial synthesis products 
with physical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gaseous 
mixture is presented in fig. 2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-95B>           Fig. 2. Diagram of equipment with application of physical absorption of carbon dioxide by </FIG>





    Regardless of the apparent prospects of technology for 
producing microbial synthesis products by organizing a closed 
gas cycle based on chemical or physical sorption of carbon 
dioxide, additional expenditures will be required with its 
implementation that are associated with creating equipment for 
producing pure oxygen and with the need to regenerate the 
sorbent or to utilize products formed as a result of chemical 
sorption of carbon dioxide. 
  Therefore, there is definite interest in a combined method 
where microorganisms that utilize oxygen and give off carbon 
dioxide in their life processes are cultured with microorganisms 
that utilize carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. For example, 
combined culturing of Candida scottii yeast and 
chlorella, whose biomass may be used as a feed additive, has 
been conducted. A diagram of equipment for combined production 
of C. scotii yeast and chlorella is presented in fig. 
3. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-96A>           Fig. 3. Diagram of equipment for combined production of microbial synthesis and chlorella </FIG>





    Such a method allows one to organize ecologically pure and 
absolutely waste-free production of microbial synthesis products 
with a significant reduction in the equipment required for this 
task, as well as in capital and operational expenditures. 
  The achievement of ecologically pure methods of conducting 
microbial synthesis assumes the use of high-efficiency reactors 
capable of processing highly concentrated nutrient media with 
low air (gas) and energy consumption.

  [Text]The primary stages of the information technology 
developed for creating and supporting a data base on metabolic 
pathways are presented in this article. The methods utilized for 
formalizing and visualizing information on metabolic pathways 
are described. A description is given of the developed software, 
which allows one to search for metabolic pathways by key words 
(their names, names of substances, enzymes) and produce a 
graphic image on the screen in various forms. 
  Existing methods of presenting information on cell 
metabolism, in our opinion, do not guarantee effective access to 
the information and do not allow one to apply modern analytical 
methods. 
  The presentation of information on metabolic pathways in the 
form of graphic diagrams is generally accepted. Diagrams of 
metabolic pathways are encountered in the majority of 
biochemistry textbooks, and charts [1, 2] and maps [3, 4] of 
metabolic pathways are widespread. Authors of original 
scientific publications on new metabolic pathways also make use 
of diagrams. 
  Apparently, visualization of information in the form of 
diagrams does not have an alternative because without graphic 
images, it is extremely difficult to represent a system in its 
entirety. Nevertheless, presenting information on cell 
metabolism in the form of metabolic maps does not guarantee 
effective access to the information and does not allow one to 
apply modern computer analysis methods. 
  The goal of this work was to create a computer data base on 
metabolic pathways that, together with the use of traditional 
visualization methods, would allow one to apply various computer 
analysis methods. In this case, it would be necessary to develop 
an effective system that would allow one to store and quickly 
process information on metabolic pathways, as well as make it 
possible for one to interface with other biochemistry and 
molecular biology data bases. 
<H3>  Primary Stages of the Technology for Support and Utilization 
of the Data Base on Metabolic Pathways </H3>
  The GDMP (graphic data base on metabolic pathways) is a 
software system for processing and storing information on 
metabolic pathways, the primary portions of which are the 
language for representing primary data, the data base, support 
software for the data base, and software for accessing and 
analyzing information stored in the data base. 
  Technology for operating the data base can be divided into 
three primary parts: translation of the original information on 
a metabolic pathway into the formal language for representing 
primary data, the MPDL (metabolic pathway data language), input 
of changes into the data base via the MPBM (metabolic pathway 
base manager) system, and user access to information via MPBR 
(metabolic pathway base retriever) software. The overall scheme 
of data base operation is shown in greater detail in fig. 1.

<H3>    Formalizing the Object Field and the MPDL Language for 
Representing Primary Data </H3>
  Metabolic pathway determination. There is no exact 
determination of metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, the current 
practice of dividing overall cell metabolism into individual 
metabolic pathways indicates that in such a division, nodal 
substances play a key role in cell metabolism. Nodal substances 
participate in many metabolic transformations as starting 
substrates or final products. An example of a nodal substance is 
glucose-6-phosphate, which participates in glycolysis, glycogen 
synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and many other 
transformations. Another example of a nodal substance is 
pyruvate, with which many metabolic transformations begin or 
end. Glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvate are related nodal 
substances coupled by the glycolysis metabolic pathway. 
  In this work, the metabolic pathway is determined as a 
sequence of reactions interacting with each other through common 
intermediates that couple related nodal substances. In a 
confluent case, the metabolic pathway can be represented as a 
single reaction. 
  In order to facilitate graphic imaging of metabolic pathways 
and their analysis, it is advisable to utilize representation on 
the three hierarchically organized levels introduced in [5] for 
poly-enzyme systems. 
  According to [5], the interactions of metabolic pathway 
reactions through common intermediates comprise the primary 
structure of this pathway. The primary structure does not 
include interactions through common coenzymes or regulatory 
substances. A well-known example of using the primary structure 
for graphic representation of metabolism is D. Nicholson's map 
"Metabolic Pathways" [3]. In the primary structure, each 
substance is represented by only one node. Such a structure is 
the skeleton of the metabolic pathway whose graphic image is 
required. 
  The addition of interactions of reactions through common 
coenzymes to the primary structure leads to a secondary or 
stoichiometric metabolic pathway structure. The complete image 
of all possible interactions of a metabolic pathway's secondary 
structure may be unsuitable due to the multiple participation of 
coenzymes in various pathway reactions. Therefore, the secondary 
structure is usually represented in a form in which connections 
through common coenzymes are by broken lines. In such an image, 
each coenzyme may be represented by several nodes if it 
participates in several reactions. 
  In order to simplify images, several connections through 
substances in the primary structure may be by broken lines. 
Usually these are simple inorganic substances of the type 
H[.sup]2[/]O, CO[.sub]2[/], orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, 
etc. A well-known example of using such a broken-line secondary 
structure of metabolic pathways is G. Michal's map "Biochemical 
Pathways" [4], published by Boehringer, Germany. 
  The set of all stoichiometric interactions of the secondary 
structure, supplemented by nonstoichiometric regulator 
interactions, comprises the tertiary structure of the metabolic 
pathway [5]. 
  In this work, only the simplest task--computer display of 
the 
secondary structure of metabolic pathways--is discussed. 
  In order to simplify further presentation, we will agree to 
call substances that participate in primary structure 
interactions and that are represented by unique nodes "metabolic 
pathway intermediates." We will call substances that supplement 
the primary structure up to the secondary structure, as well as 
primary structure substances that are graphically represented by 
broken, non-unique nodes, "cointermediates." 
  MPDL language for representing data. The MPDL 
language for representing data is a subset of the format for 
representing data from the DBEMP factual data base on enzymes 
and metabolic pathways [6]. 
  The MPDL language is intended for formally describing 
metabolic pathways, and it includes software for describing the 
bibliographic source of information, the biological source, the 
intracellular localization of enzymes, and the metabolic pathway 
reactions themselves. 
  The MPDL-file is in ASCII format and consists of records. 
  A record is a logical unit of language that describes an 
individual metabolic pathway and consists of a sequence of 
fields. 
  A field consists of a title, located in the first columns 
and 
containing a portion separated from the title by a space. Fields 
are divided into "required" and "not required." 
  The MPDL language is compatible with the DBEMP format in 
such 
a way that any MPDL-record satisfies DBEMP requirements. A DBEMP 
record satisfies MPDL requirements if it meets the following two 
conditions: 
  1) the two fields required for an MPDL-record are present; 
  2) the MPDL syntax rules are followed. 
  Representation of primary data on a metabolic pathway 
in MPDL language. The described version of the data base 
includes an MPDL variant in which a record may contain 10 
fields. Their designations are briefly described below: 
  AN (accession number) contains a record identifier; 
  SO (source) contains a bibliographic description of the 
information source; 
  OR (organism) and OCN (organism common name) contain the 
systematic and commonly used names of an organism; 
  SPN (systematic pathway name), MPW (metabolic pathway), and 
APN (alternative pathway name) contain the systematic, 
recommended, and commonly used names of a metabolic pathway; 
  MPW E has the form of a table, consisting of a title line 
and 
content lines. The title line contains names of fields in the 
table. Content lines contain descriptions of the metabolic 
pathway reactions contained in these fields; four fields in the 
table--EC (enzyme code), EN (enzyme name), RE (reaction), and RD 
(reaction direction)--are entered in the appropriate language 
variant and contain the enzyme code, the recommended name, the 
reaction, and the reaction direction, respectively; 
  DES (designation) contains abbreviated names of substances; 
  INM (intermediates) contains names of metabolic pathway 
intermediates (but not cointermediates). 
  A sample record in MPDL language is given below. 


<H5>  MPBM Data Base Support Software </H5>
  MPBM software is executed in the form of a 300 K EXE-file. 
It 
is in C language (QuickC compiler, Microsoft). The system is 
intended for MPDL-file (containing MPDL language records) 
processing by the expert-operator with the goals of filling the 
data base, entering changes to the graphic images stored in the 
data base, and retrieval when information from the data base is 
needed. Expert-operator interface with MPBM is accomplished by 
means of a system of menus and dialog windows. 
  MPDL language translator. The two-way translator 
assures syntax and name verification and the formation of 
internal representation of metabolic pathways, including the 
stoichiometric matrix and the incidence matrix for subsequent 
construction of graphic images. 
  In general, the process proceeds with the participation of 
the expert-operator, who responds to system requests in specific 
situations. For example, with the appearance of an unknown 
substance name in the system, direct support of the expert is 
required in order to remove mistakes from the name. 
  Metabolic pathway imaging. General description. 
The image is a two-dimensional graph. The graphics software is 
divided into three types of nodes and two types of branches. 
  Each node type designates a metabolic pathway enzyme, 
intermediate, or co-intermediate (see the section "Metabolic 
pathway determination"). Each enzyme or intermediate is 
designated by a single node. Cointermediates are designated by 
several nodes, each of which corresponds to the 
co-intermediate's participation in a given reaction. 
  A branch of the first type is always directed from an 
intermediate to an enzyme and indicates the intermediate's 
participation as a substrate in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. A 
branch of the second type is always directed from an enzyme to 
an intermediate and indicates the intermediate's participation 
as a product in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. 
  An image may also contain various names for each node and be 
viewed on two different scales. 
  Initial planar configuration of the graph. A special 
interative algorithm for planar graph configuration is utilized 
to construct the inital image [7]. The algorithm is empirical 
and intended for producing graphic images that are visually well 
perceived. Our experience indicates that as a result of using 
the algorithm, at least the general structure of the graph is 
viewed well. 
  In conjunction with a sensitive algorithm developed by us 
for 
the initial configuration of points, the system asks the 
operator to assign one of two methods for initial configuration 
of graph nodes, utilizing his own knowledge regarding the cyclic 
nature of the metabolic pathway. 
  MPGE graphic editor. The MPGE graphic editor is intended for 
putting the metabolic pathway image in a form suitable for 
visual analysis. 
  The editor's resources take into account requirements that 
are traditionally imposed on metabolic pathway diagrams, but 
they do not restrict the author in the selection of a method for 
planar graph configuration. All operations can be carried out 
with a mouse. 
  The editor allows one to intermix individual nodes or groups 
of nodes and to arrange a group of nodes in a circle of desired 
radius or in a line of desired length. Operations may be 
conducted on two image scales. It is possible to work with named 
nodes or without them. With the input of changes, the image is 
automatically reconstructed. 
  Information storage in the data base. Data base 
structure. After an image of the required form is created, 
information on the metabolic pathway can be stored in the data 
base by means of a special command. The image form is stored as 
node coordinates. 
  The data base consists of 16 files in the relational SUBD 
"Paradox" (Borland) format that contain information on metabolic 
pathways in an internal form as well as support information. 
  Input of changes to the data base. It is possible 
to input two types of changes: changes to the image form and 
changes to metabolic pathway information at the 
MPDL-communication level. 
  In the first case, changes are entered by means of the MPGE 
editor; in the second--it is possible to retrieve information on 
a metabolic pathway from the data base by means of a special 
command and then to input the appropriate changes into the 
MPDL-file and rewrite the necessary record (see also fig. 1). 
<H5>  Software for Accessing the MPBR Data Base </H5>
  MPBR software is executed in the form of a 200 K EXE-file. 
It 
is in C language (QuickC compiler, Microsoft). The system is 
intended for assuring user access to information on metabolic 
pathways and also includes software for analyzing metabolic 
pathways. MPBR operates in the EGA graphic regime. User 
interface includes a hierarchical menu system, a series of 
pictograms, and a help window system. Complete 
interchangeability of the keyboard and mouse is assured. The 
metabolic pathway image is also used as a graphic interface. 
  Version 1.3 (October 1992) contains the resources described 
below. 
  Information on data base content. The user can 
obtain information regarding the number of metabolic pathways 
contained in the data base as well as about the overall number 
of substances and enzymes that participate in them. 
  Viewing metabolic pathway diagrams. The user 
selects a desired pathway from an alphabetized list of 
recommended names of metabolic pathways, at which point he gains 
access to systematic and commonly used names of the metabolic 
pathway as well as the biological source given in the original 
report. A portion of the menu system, with which these 
operations are executed, is shown in fig. 2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-101A> Fig. 2. Portion of the MPBR software menu system that allows the user to view a metabolic </FIG>





    After selection of a metabolic pathway, the system proceeds 
to the viewing regime. The image may be viewed in two ranges. 
Transition to the larger scale proceeds with the aid of a 
movable scale frame. 
  It is possible to include the names of graph nodes in the 
image. Names are EC-codes or recommended names for enzymes (in 
agreement with the enzyme classification in [8]) and complete or 
abbreviated names for substances. 
  In fig. 3, made from a screen display, a black-and-white 
image of the citric acid cycle is shown. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-102A>           Fig. 3. MPBR software. Image of </FIG>





    Figure 4 shows how a portion of this image appears on a 
larger scale. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-102B>           Fig. 4. MPBR software. Image on </FIG>





    Searching for metabolic pathways containing a specific 
substance or enzyme. The user selects a desired object from 
an alphabetized list of substance or enzyme names and obtains a 
list of metabolic pathways in which the given substance or 
enzyme participates. A portion of the corresponding menu system 
is shown in fig. 5. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-102C>           Fig. 5. Portion of the MPBR </FIG>





    This list is analogous to the general list of recommended 
names (see ``Viewing metabolic pathway diagrams''). While 
viewing images of metabolic pathways from the list, one can 
obtain information about the participation of the enzyme or 
substance in each of them. To accomplish this, the system 
automatically selects, during image formation via the graphics 
software, the substance or enzyme about which the inquiry was 
made. 
<H5>  Discussion of Results and Prospective Development </H5>
  In this work, software for visualizing and processing 
information based on the GDMP data base is described. Primary 
information on the structure of a metabolic pathway and the 
intermediates and enzymes participating in it is contained in 
the data base; however, several important characteristics have 
not yet been reflected by the data base software. In the 
described version of the data base, information on the 
intracellular localization of enzymes of a metabolic path and 
their regulation is absent. It is planned to include this 
information in future versions. 
  In the next versions, a link should also be established with 
the factual data base on enzymes and metabolic pathways in DBEMP 
[6] so that the user would be able to obtain information on the 
catalytic, regulatory, and molecular biological properties of 
enzymes participating in metabolic pathways. 
  There is definite interest, in our opinion, for the user to 
have the resources to view structural formulas of intermediates 
via the estblishment of a link with the corresponding data base. 
  Development of software, on the basis of this data base, for 
automating mathematical modeling and using algorithms for 
analyzing graphs for studying various aspects of metabolic 
pathway functioning appears interesting and promising to us. 
  We will be grateful for any comments or suggestions 
concerning possibilities for developing the system in these and 
other directions.

  [Abstract] Sulfoaromatic compounds, which are among the 
most important products of the chemical industry, are also 
environmental pollutants. Because strains that destroy such 
compounds have been only partially described, the researchers 
here sought to present a complete picture of the genetic control 
and regulation of the process associated with the decomposition 
of sulfoaromatic compounds. In studying the genetic control of 
the decomposition of arylsulfonates in Pseudomonas 
sp. BS1304, they demonstrated that the process of destruction is 
controlled by the plasmid pBS1004, which has a molecular weight 
of 120 kbp and belongs to the IncP-9 incompatibility group. The 
plasmid can be isolated in P. putida, P. aeruginosa, 
and P. mendocina. Degradation of the substrates 
begins with desulfonation and subsequent meta-cleavage of the 
substituted catechols. Both stages are effected by enzymes with 
high substrate specificity. The researchers found that the 
instability of the trait under consideration was associated with 
the formation of spontaneous deletions in the plasmid. 
Ultimately, the researchers demonstrated that the formation of 
such deletions is induced by Rms178 of the IncP-2 
incompatibility group. Figures 3, references 13: 1 Russian, 12

Ukraine; received Mar 10 93] 
  [Text] The fate of the future of every people depends on 
their natural and social characteristics and the totality of 
external effects. The natural foundation of a population is 
represented by the gene pool, which is the basis of population 
integrity and stability, as well as of its functioning and 
development. The condition of the gene pool is determined both 
by internal laws and external effects of ecological factors. It 
is well known that a joint action of genetic mechanisms and 
ecological factors causes around 60% of the total amount 
of 
damage of population condition and health. However, in Ukraine a 
certain asymmetry in attention given to these two components has 
formed: while wide circles of scientists and public have 
expressed steadfast and strong interest in the ecology 
component, the genetic component is drawing attention of very 
few research professionals. So the real contribution of genetic 
mechanisms to health condition of the population has not yet 
become the subject of modern wide)scale theoretical and applied 
studies. However, it is clear that the nearest future of 
Ukraine's population depends to a large extent on timely and 
complex solution of the gene pool problem.To make this statement 
not just clear intuitively but also well reasoned we shall turn 
now to well)known facts.1. Since 1989 the reproduction of 
Ukraine's population has been decreasing, and there is a danger 
of its depopulation. Mortality has surpassed the birth rate 
[1,2]. According to Minstat [the Ministry of Statistics of 
Ukraine] the index of natural reduction of Ukraine's population 
was 39147 people in 1991 and 96861 in 1992. At the same time the 
reproduction rate for the number of girls born per woman who 
have reached 15 years of age and has dropped below one, to 0.976 
[1, 2]. In the last decade the frequency of hypotrophy among the 
newborn has increased fivefold, and the frequency of genetic 
disturbances, native developmental defects, spontaneous 
miscarriages and psychic diseases has also increased. 46% 
of 
high school students suffer from various chronic diseases, and 
one out of two has morphological and functional disturbances. 
Only 5 to 8% of high school graduates can be considered 
healthy 
[1, 3].Thus, dangerous trends of increasing reproductive losses 
of and genetic load in Ukraine's population have clearly 
shaped.2. The damaging effect of the extremely tense ecological 
situation in Ukraine is getting more serious. Excessive 
concentration of the metal mining, metallurgical, coal mining, 
power generating and chemical industries with their mostly 
obsolete and ecologically dangerous equipment, and inefficient 
and sometimes monoculture agriculture, they all dangerously 
pollute the environment. In the majority of regions atmospheric 
air pollution exceeds maximum permissible levels five to 
twentyfold, ground is being chemically poisoned, and 3 billion 
cubic meters of polluted sewage are dischargedT)annually into 
the environment [4]. The chemical load on the gene pool is 
increased due to the effect of the Chernobyl catastrophe. In 
recent years the number of certain oncological, hematological 
and endocrine diseases has increased, while the overall level of 
immune protection in people has decreased, especially in those 
who had been subjected to the effect of Chernobyl radiation 
factors.3. A number of infections, especially such as 
chlamidioses, mycoplasmoses, ureoplasmoses, as well as 
gelmintoses and virus carrying, have a negative effect on the 
gene pool.4. Ukraine has a relatively high level of a number of 
hereditary diseases and native developmental defects, and due to 
the extremely low availability of diagnostic means and 
medication they have an especially high negative effect on the 
gene pool.5. The multinational and multiethnic character of 
Ukraine's population is the result of the complicated history of 
the people who for many centuries has been divided among several 
states and affected by internal and external migration of large 
population masses, the 1932/ 1933 famine, substantial losses 
during WWII and other factors. This is why the gene pool of 
Ukraine's population and her regional and ethnic formations 
requires that a differentiated population)genetic research be 
conducted.The above circumstances (as well as other 
circumstances that have not been listed, make it possible to 
conclude that the question is not only preservation but also 
protection of Ukraine's gene pool. Apparently it is necessary to 
have a thoroughly thought over and carefully worked out program 
of scientific studies and practical actions.The main idea in 
developing a program to protect the gene pool of Ukraine's 
population is the understanding of its urgency by a group of 
scientists and by the Health Ministry management and taking into 
account certain work performed in this area and the available 
personnel and material and technical potential.A group of 
scientists had been developing the program in the 1980s, but it 
only became possible to develop a complete project in 1990/1991. 
The concept of the Program is based on the fact that problems of 
legislative, medical, scientific, personnel, economic and 
organizational support must be solved in an integrated manner, 
with a clear definition of the work scope and stages.The Program 
has been developed for a five)year period and counts on 
participation of researchers from various fields of biological 
and medical science and medical)genetic service 
practitioners.All Program provisions were centered around the 
following conceptual components: 1) studying the status of the 
gene pool of Ukraine's population; 2) genetic monitoring; 3) 
prevention and treatment of hereditary disturbances and native 
developmental defects; and 4) computerized forecasting systems 
for integrated control of the gene pool of Ukraine's population 
[5].The Program passed the competition conducted in 1991)1992 by 
the State Committee of Ukraine on Science and Technology 
Problems and took the first prize in the ``Human Health'' field. 
Thus it has acquired the status of a state S&amp;T Program.In 
1992 
74 projects of 27 academic and industry scientific and 
scientific production organizations and universities were under 
way within the Program framework. The Program consists of 8 
sections and 48 subsections that cover aspects of medical and 
scientific support and infrastructure ) creation of a scientific 
research institute and specialized medical genetics centers, as 
well as personnel, material, organizational and economic 
support.A number of studies regarding the status of the gene 
pool and effects of)ecological factors were performed.The 
mutagenous load on the environment was analyzed and evaluated. 
In particular, the summary mutagenous activity of the aerosol 
portion of chemical pollutants of atmospheric air was studied 
using the Ames method. It was demonstrated that in a group of 
``metallurgical'' towns the activity exceeded background values 
by a factor of 13 to 20, (``average'' mutageneity), while in 
towns with prevailing development of the chemical industry it 
varied between ``weak'' and ``average''. However, it was found 
that even in a control group of relatively ``clean'' towns 
genetic toxicity of air exceeded the background (by 50% in 
Sevastopol and by a factor of 8 in Poltava) (see the article by 
O.M. Dugan et al. in this issue of the magazine).Scientific 
foundations of screening for native and hereditary pathology had 
been developed, and the screening was conducted.An account of 
hereditary and native pathology and perinatal mortality among 
Kiev newborn was conducted, and the structure of native 
developmental defects was studied. It was demonstrated that in 
recent years the level of their variations varied within a wide 
range, albeit without any growth trends. This calls for studying 
the spread of dominant and recessive pathology in capital's 
population and for creation of a computerized register [7].A 
retrospective analysis of the structure of hereditary pathology 
in the Western region of Ukraine was conducted. It showed 
different densities of native developmental defects, 
phenylketonuria and hypothyrosis in various oblasts. The scope 
of necessary studies in each oblast and measures aimed at 
improving organization of medical preventive work were 
determined (Lviv Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Hereditary Pathology 
SRI, MOZ Ukrayiny).The frequency and types of chromosome 
aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of people that had 
been subjected to radiation effects after the ChAES [Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant] accident were studied. Significant 
individual variability of their frequency had been noticed. It 
was concluded that according to cytologic analysis data it can 
be considered a confirmed fact that radiation affected not only 
on those who participated in liquidation of consequences of the 
ChAES accident and residents of the stringent radiation control 
zone, but also Kievites. Taking into account the fact that 
genome changes can facilitate an increased share of certain 
malignant tumors, the studies that were conducted orient one 
towards individual approach to studies of the contribution of 
both damaging environmental factors and the hereditary component 
to the development of pathology (Experimental Pathology, 
Oncology and Radio Biology Institute, AN Ukrayiny).Studies of 
the spread of hereditary propensity to disturbances of formation 
and native developmental defects of the locomotor system in 
Ukraine regions with different levels of inbreeding and 
environmental pollution demonstrated that the most frequent 
disturbances were the ankle joint pathology and foot 
deformation. The frequency of this pathology in regions that had 
suffered from the ChAES accident especially hard and in 
ecologically disadvantageous Donets basin rayons is considerably 
higher than in Kiev. The studies continue, and a computerized 
register and forecasting model are being developed (see the 
article by A.P. Krasyuk et al. in this issue of the magazine).It 
was found that the number of cases of native pathology of organs 
of vision in children is increasing (approximately one third of 
all patients). Pathologies such as ptosis, dermoid cysts, 
hemangiomas and retinoblastomas are unevenly distributed among 
Ukraine regions. Among those hospitalized with a hereditary 
pathology of cornea the most frequently encountered was a 
chronic form of keratoconus and the least frequently encountered 
was peripheral keratoconus (Terien disease), but no regional 
differences had been detected. In children that had recieved a 
large overall dose of radiation due to the Chernobyl 
catastrophe, the frequency of the ophthalmologic pathology 
hasT)increased (Ukrainian Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue 
Therapy, MOZ Ukrayiny).According to preliminary analysis data in 
cases of hearing diseases the most frequently observed is the 
autosomal recessive type of inheritance of deafness and reduced 
hearing, while the autosomal dominant type and the type linked 
to the X chromosome are less frequent. The expediency of 
regional and population studies of inherited pathology of organs 
of hearing, determining the probability of its detection and 
treating it as a separate group was demonstrated (Kiev 
Otolaryngology SRI, MOZ Ukrayiny).Of great scientific importance 
are projects devoted to human genome, which form a section of 
the Program. The work is being conducted at a state of the art 
molecular)biological level and has yielded interesting results. 
Libraries of the 3rd, 5th and 19th chromosomes have been 
amplified. mRNA were extracted from human and rabbit livers in 
order to create kDNA probes. Major transcripts that yield 
themselves to alternative processing were extracted from the 
kDNA library of human embryo livers. mRNA from human brain and 
kidney and the entire RNA from a human heart were extracted in 
order to create kDNA probes. Differential screening of the kDNA 
library of human livers was performed, and clones with liver 
specific and "generic" genes were obtained.The spectrum of 
2.5)oligoadenylates in initial cultures of cells of chronic 
lymphoid leukosis patients was studied, as well as changes of 
the expression of receptors of interleukin 2 and the C3 fraction 
of the complement in patients' leukocytes due to the effect of 
immunity correcting preparations.The possibility of injecting 
RecA protein E. coli into an jejukaryotic cell while 
preserving protein enzyme activity has been demonstrated. 
Peculiarities of expression of the human ApoAI genome and DNA 
genes in a cell culture of mammals controlled by promoters of 
cytomegalovirus, mice rybosomic and RNA polymerase II were 
studied (human Alu repeat). It was demonstrated that in a 
plasmid retrovector DNA (plasmid probe pSTH lg 1/Rtsp) there is 
a fragment that corresponds to the human growth hormone gene. 
This makes it possible to continue developing a gene therapy 
model based on the human hematopoietic system. A system for 
computer storage and processing of electrophoregrams, 
particularly when detecting point mutations in various genome 
areas, was developed. Based on computer analysis data, 
oligonucleotide primers for the constant area of the IgE gene 
were calculated. It was demonstrated that the IgE response 
(pollinosis) is linked to human organism resistivity to 
respiratory diseases, and it was also found that in recent years 
there had been a trend towards a decrease in the number and 
functional activity of T lymphocytes accompanied by increased 
reactivity of B lymphocytes (Molecular Biology and Genetics 
Institute, AN Ukrayiny; Ukrainian Medical Genetics Science 
Center, MOZ and AN Ukrayiny).Work on genetic monitoring is 
conducted within the framework of the Program. The key point of 
the work is a combination of genetic and ecological studies. 
Results of studies of ground in five national preserves in the 
Western, Eastern and Southern regions show the presence of toxic 
and mutagenous effects. Analysis of aberrations (mostly 
chromatide) detected in sprout roots of Allium cepa 
onion shows the dominant action of chemical mutagens, and in 
areas adjacent to arable land it could possibly be pesticide 
phenomena. But positive results of bioindication in the absence 
of evidence of the presence of local pollution sources indicate 
a regional or global (including biospheric) character of 
pollution [8].Work has begun on genotoxicological evaluation of 
the territory of national preserve ``Roztochchya'' (Lviv 
oblast). The system of tests includes the AmesT)test, test for 
dominant lethal mutations and test for somatic mutations and 
recombination. In the water reservoirs at the reserve a 
mutagenic effect in fish was found. An assumption of industrial 
pollution was made. The studies that have been performed are 
part of the work on inventorying mutagens in the Lviv oblast 
(Lviv University).The level of genotoxic pollution of areas of 
the lower Danube and Dnieper (using bacterial test systems with 
salmonella strains) is being studied. Accumulation of genotoxic 
pollution in the silt of region's lakes and rivers was detected. 
Considerable variations of mutagenic activity at levels 
exceeding the spontaneous level by a factor of 2 to 6 was 
noticed. Activity of mutagenic action of organic)soluble 
fractions was considerably higher than that of water soluble 
fractions (Odessa University). Based on studies that used 
measurements of activity of marked enzymes of 
pseudocholinesterase and creatine phosphokinase, determining the 
amount of peroxide oxidation of lipoids and accumulation of 
malone dialdehyde in blood samples (taken to a low temperature 
bank from blood transfusion stations in several unfavorable 
areas of the Donets)Dnieper region and city of Kharkiv) it was 
found that the maximum permissible level of heavy metals had 
been exceeded. Computerized processing of the results is 
promising for development of genetic monitoring (Problems of 
Cryobiology and Cryomedicine Institute, AN Ukrayiny). Selective 
analysis of chromosome pathology and the condition of chromosome 
apparatus in children in various regions of Ukraine 
(particularly in regions that had suffered from the Chernobyl 
catastrophe) revealed that even in a relatively ``clean'' 
region, the Lviv oblast, the overall frequency of chromosome 
aberrations in newborn in 1992 was approximately 120% 
higher 
than in Kiev in 1984 (Lviv Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Hereditary 
Pathology SRI, MOZ Ukrayiny). Cytogenetic analysis of several 
groups of children residing in areas polluted with radio 
nuclides as a result of the Chernobyl accident demonstrated a 
reliable increase of the frequency of aberrant cells, 
chromosome)type aberrations and specific markers of radiation 
effects. A trend of increasing cytogenetic effect with time is 
being observed [9]. A number of trends of genetic instability 
has been detected in populations adjacent to the ChAES: 
increased number of native anomalies and spontaneous 
miscarriages, a shift of the chromosome aberrations spectrum, 
increased frequency of structural defects in the bone system in 
embryos compared to the control group, and increased share of 
children with disturbances of catabolic P protein homeostasis 
[10].Studies of ecological effects on hereditary pathology had 
led to a search for comparison methods and equivalents of 
effects of various factors. Thus, genetic)epidemiological 
studies of spontaneous miscarriages and native developmental 
defects in ecologically polluted industrial towns demonstrated 
that genetic consequences of the effect of chemical factors can 
be compared to the effect of radiation. For Mariupol they are 
equivalent to the effect of 230 Ber over 30 years [11].Studies 
of problems of diagnostics, prevention and treatment of 
hereditary diseases and native developmental defects are a 
considerable part of the State Program. Cytogenetic examination 
and computerized population analysis of the Kharkiv population 
led to a conclusion of expediency and effectiveness of applying 
genetic approaches to family planning and using the program of 
preconception help to families with native developmental defects 
and aborted pregnancies. A system of preventive measures 
includes family examination, preventive sanation, 
synchronization of reproductive processes and individual 
preventive help to pregnant women. This makes it possible to 
reduce the use of invasiveT) procedures by 33% 
[12].Studies 
have demonstrated that not only complex prenatal diagnostics 
makes it possible to conduct selective examination of women in a 
high)risk group (those suffering from sugar diabetes and 
internal infections, but also perform mass scale screening of 
pregnant women. The complex includes ultrasound scanning and 
timely invasive procedures. Based on examination results not 
only one makes decisions on interrupting pregnancy in expedient 
cases, but also on emergency help to newborn with correctable 
defects [13].A number of projects are aimed at developing 
diagnostic methods and searching for markers that indicate 
genetic disturbances.A test system for early diagnostics of 
dilatation cardiomyopathy using monospecific polyclonal 
antibodies is being developed. It has been demonstrated that in 
all cases of this pathology the serum contains autoantibodies 
against myosin and tropomyosin (Molecular Biology and genetics 
Institute, AN Ukrayiny; Ukrainian Medical Genetics Science 
Center, MOZ and AN Ukrayiny).A 50)item collection of mutants 
that are resistant to glyphosphate, a phosphorus analog of 
glycine. This opens up a possibility for continuing a search for 
methods for affecting a number of molecular)biological 
mechanisms. Certain areas of the Y chromosome were detected and 
analyzed, which forms a basis for testing mutations using 
restriction analysis (Molecular Biology and Genetics Institute, 
AN Ukrayiny). Methods are being developed for using DNA 
analysis of certain mutations and deletions linked to a high 
risk of mucoviscidosis disease and formation of Duchen's 
muscular dystrophy in various regions of Ukraine [14].A 
longitudinal polymorphism of restriction fragments of the apo)B 
gene that were obtained using the polymerase chain reaction and 
then the XbaI and SSt)1 restrictases was studied. The relation 
between the detection of three genotypes of X1X1 and X2X2 and 
indices of lipoid metabolism was analyzed. Prospects for further 
studies of genes of basic apo)proteins in the population at the 
preclinical and clinical stages of atherosclerosis in families 
of young patients have been delineated (Ukrainian Therapy SRI, 
MOZ Ukrayiny). During cytogenetic examination of children that 
were subjected to the effects of the Chernobyl catastrophe an 
increased frequency of specific markers of radiation effects was 
detected, and based on this an attempt was made to calculate the 
overall radiation dose [9].Methods are being developed for 
determining mutagenous effects of chemical and physical factors 
on the gene pool using sensitive genetically marked strains of 
microorganisms that can register one mutation per 10 to 100 
million of normal cells, which borders on the spontaneous 
mutagenesis background (Microbiology and Virology Institute, AN 
Ukrayiny).Enriching the arsenal of anti-mutagenic means is 
especially important for solving problems of preventing and 
correcting hereditary pathology, and it has been the subject of 
several projects.Scientific fundamentals of the search for and 
development and application of antimutagenes and gene protectors 
are being developed. They are aimed at increasing the 
effectiveness of organism's internal protective forces, 
particularly DNA reparation systems, blocking damaged genome 
structures etc.Promising studies of interferon inductors and 
prolongators were performed, and optimum conditions for 
obtaining its preparations and developing a compound that can 
induce interferon that has the antimutagenic effect were 
determined (Kiev University).T 0*0*0*00T The effect of 
bioflavonoids and polysaccharides on anti-mutagenic and radio 
protection activity of beta carotene was studied. It had been 
determined that beta carotene displays well pronounced 
antimutagenic activity against nitrozoguanidine, a supermutagen 
and supercarcinogen, and average antimutagenic activity against 
carbon and phosphorus radioactive isotopes (Microbiology and 
Virology Institute, AN Ukrayiny). A search for natural 
anti-mutagenes is being conducted. Researchers are finding even 
more advantages of natural antimutagenes over chemical factors. 
Experiments with higher plants demonstrate the protective effect 
of the millimeter wave band electric field on the chromosome 
apparatus. It has been determined that low exposures and doses 
of a UHF field help reduce the total number and shrink the 
spectrum of chromosome mutations. The possibility of 
extrapolating these results to other biological objects 
including a human organism has been demonstrated. The search for 
vegetative antimutagenes (a biological mass of rose radiola, 
fern)leaf polyscias etc.) continues, their cytogenic action is 
being studied, and first promising results have been obtained 
(Ukrainian Medical Genetics Science Center, MOZ and AN 
Ukrayiny).The first year of scientific studies according to the 
State S&amp;T Program ``Protection of the Gene Pool of Ukraine's 
Population'' has had productive results.The work of science 
collectives has begun, and authors of research objects and 
methods have been determined. A number of specific results have 
been obtained in all areas of the Program. They are valuable in 
their own right, but what is more important, they open up 
prospects for deepening and widening further science search. 
Research coordination has been set up, and the Ukrainian 
Medical Genetics Science Center, the lead scientific research 
organization in implementing the Program, has been organized.

  [Text] Much attention is currently being devoted to 
indicators of the immune status of healthy people in different 
regions of the country [1]. Persuasive evidence was obtained 
indicating that the body's immune system reacts very sensitively 
to various unfavorable effects, and it can be used to test for 
these effects [3]. Indicators of the immune status of people of 
different regions differ [1]. Such research has special 
significance in the country's ecologically unfavorable regions 
as a way of revealing the extent of the immune system's 
disturbance and the need for purposeful clinical examination and 
treatment and for measures by which to improve the health of the 
people. 
  One of the ecologically unfavorable zones requiring special 
attention is the Aral zone, including the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan, where examination and treatment results for 1989 
[2] reveal elevated morbidity characterized as the 
immunodeficiency syndrome and as the autoimmune and allergic 
syndromes (Table 1). Study of the immune status of the 
population of the Republic of Karakalpakstan is required if we 
are to plan measures to reduce overall morbidity.

<H5>  Research Procedures </H5>
  Three hundred forty-eight practically healthy people from 16 
to 60 years old residing in the three cities of Nukus, Muynak 
and Mangit were examined. Diagnostic questionnaire cards 
developed by the Immunology Institute of the Russian Ministry of 
Health [5] were filled out on each subject. Immune status was 
evaluated in accordance with procedural recommendations of the 
USSR Ministry of Health [5], including level I and II tests. 
Determinations were also made of the concentration of the 
rheumatoid factor, and of antibodies to thyroglobulin and 
trinitrophenyl in blood serum by triphasic immunoenzymatic 
analysis (IEA). The absolute and relative leukocyte and 
lymphocyte counts were estimated by the commonly employed 
procedure using Zadorozhnyy's stain, while T-lymphocytes and 
their subpopulations were determined with monoclonal antibodies 
obtained from the Immunology Institute using a flow-through 
cytometer. The concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM was 
determined by Mancini's method, while IgE was determined by the 
IEA method. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils was evaluated on 
the basis of absorption by latex particles. The t-test was used 
for statistical treatment. 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  According to WHO data diseases associated with disturbance 
of 
immune system function fall within so-called immunopathological 
syndromes (infection, allergic, autoimmune). They manifest 
themselves as chronic inflammatory diseases, as the absence of 
resistance to infections, and as allergic and autoimmune 
afflictions. Questionnaire results revealed that 37.3 percent of 
the surveyed population suffers diseases falling within these 
syndromes. 
  Table 2 gives the average immune status indicators for the 
Karakalpakstan population, as well as for residents of 
Semipalatinsk and workers of an antibiotics plant (Moscow) and 
the Khimplast Plant (Nizhniy Tagil), used for comparison 
purposes (the data were obtained by associates of the Immunology 
Institute of the Russian Ministry of Health). 



  The first interesting thing analysis of the results shows is 
an extremely low concentration of T-lymphocytes and their 
subpopulations in Karakalpakstan residents in terms of both 
percent and absolute content (see Table 2). While the 
concentration of lymphocytes is 63.2 +/- 1.29, 70 +/- 0.7 and 
62.02 +/- 0.45 percent in subjects from Semipalatinsk, Moscow 
and Nizhniy Tagil respectively, for Karakalpakia this indicator 
is 52.58 +/- 0.52 percent. The absolute number of lymphocytes in 
subjects in Karakalpakia is also significantly reduced. The 
concentration of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes among 
Karakalpakstan residents is 39.8 +/- 0.46 percent, while in the 
indicated cities (Semipalatinsk, Moscow, Nizhniy Tagil) it is 
34.4 +/- 1.1, 45 +/- 0.7 and 35.81 +/-0.39 percent respectively. 
In this case the absolute number of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes 
in Karakalpakstan residents averages only 498 
cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. All of the indicated differences are 
statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). 
  An evaluation of the frequency of deviations of the percent 
and absolute concentrations of lymphocytes from average standard 
values in Karakalpakstan residents (Table 3) revealed that the 
lymphocyte count was less than 19 percent for 10.9 percent of 
the subjects, the indicator was above 37 percent for only 6.03 
percent of the subjects, and the absolute lymphocyte count of 33 
percent was less than 1,200 cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. There were an 
especially large number of people with an absolute concentration 
of CD1[.sup]+[/]- and CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes below 
standard indicators (53.2 and 64.6 percent respectively).

  Phagocytic activity of leukocytes was significantly higher 
among Karakalpakstan residents when compared with residents of 
Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil: 85.4 +/- 0.56, 64.8 
+/-0.86, 71 +/- 0.7 and 58.5 +/- 0.99 respectively. The 
percentage of persons for whom the phagocytosis indicator was 
above standard values is 65.8 for Karakalpakstan residents (see 
tables 2, 3). Such an increase in phagocytic activity is 
possibly associated with a source of constant infection. 
  Evaluation of the B-system of immunity in Karakalpakstan 
residents revealed a significantly higher concentration of IgG, 
IgA, IgM and IgE than in the residents of the cities used for 
comparison. Thus, while the concentration of IgG, IgA and IgM in 
residents of Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil was 1337.4 
+/- 21.8, 1313 +/- 27 and 1095.3 +/- 13.17 for IgG, 190.3 +/- 
6.82, 215 +/- 9.1 and 220 +/- 5.7 for IgA, and 156.7 +/- 5.3, 
140 +/- 5.1 and 144.4 +/- 4 for IgM, these indicators for 
Karakalpakstan residents were equal to 1497.6 +/- 17, 265.3 +/- 
5.6 and 167.1 +/- 3.9 respectively. The percentage of people for 
whom these indicators were above normal was 1.14 for IgG, 17.8 
for IgA and 12.9 for IgM (see Table 3). The percentage of 
persons with hypoglobulinemia did not differ from the union-wide 
value. 
  Additional research characterizing activity of the immune 
system did not reveal gross disturbances, and the levels of the 
rheumatoid factor, antibodies to thyroglobulin and 
trinitrophenyl fluctuated within normal limits. 
  The morbidity structure of the Karakalpakstan population is 
dominated by autoimmune diseases, which exceed union-wide 
indicators by 2-8 times, while the frequency of diseases falling 
within the infection syndrome exceeds the union-wide indicator 
by 2.5-4 times (see Table 1). 
  When taken together, these figures are very similar to 
laboratory data and morbidity indicators obtained in surveys of 
elderly people [4]. It may be hypothesized that the residents of 
the indicated regions are exposed to unfavorable factors that 
lead to the described changes in immunological indicators, which 
manifests itself phenomenologically as early aging and as 
diseases associated with immunodeficiency. However, additional 
research will be required to establish a direct relationship 
between this morbidity and disturbance of the immune system. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  1. The relative and absolution numbers of T-lymphocytes and 
their subpopulations are reduced among residents of the 
Karakalpakstan Republic. 
  2. A higher concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE and 
higher phagocytic activity of leukocytes are typical of 
residents of the surveyed region.

  [Text] The data of epidemiological investigations devoted 
to the study of the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) suggest that 
the prevalence of the latter is associated with the level of 
risk factors (RF) in various population groups [4, 14, 17, 26, 
27]. This has been confirmed by the relationship discovered 
between the frequency of identification of CVD and of RF in 
population investigations [7, 11, 14, 18]. As has been 
demonstrated in large prospective investigations, morbidity from 
CVD and mortality from them are determined to a significant 
extent by the level of RF in populations [17, 25]. 
  The epidemiological situation with respect to CVD depends to 
a significant extent also on the frequency of identification of 
various combinations of RF in populations [1, 21, 24, 31]. In 
addition, according to the data of certain investigations, the 
level of RF in populations also depends on such characteristics 
as the age of the population, ethnic affiliation, educational 
level, and the character of the subject's work activity [2, 5, 
13, 23, 30]. And finally, the study of the prevalence of RF 
separately and especially in various combinations is very 
important from the point of view of the assessment of the 
prognostic significance of the level of RF for the development 
of new cases and of mortality from CVD among the population [6, 
10, 18, 31]. 
  The aim of the present investigations was to study the 
comparative characteristic of the prevalence of the principal 
CVD RF individually and in various combinations as a function of 
the character of work activity and educational level among the 
male population aged 20-54 years, living in cities of various 
regions of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]. The 
investigation was carried out within the framework of the 
unified cooperative program, RThe Epidemiology of IHD and 
Atherosclerosis in Various Regions of the CIS and the Baltic 
CountriesS, carried out and coordinated by the Department of the 
Epidemiology of Noninfectious Diseases of the All-Russian 
Scientific Research Center of Preventive Medicine of the 
Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation [VNITsPM Minzdrava 
RF]. 
  Materials and Methods&gt; 
  Random representative samples of the male population aged 
20-54 years, living in one of the regions of eight cities, 
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, 
Tashkent, and Bishkek, were the material for the investigation. 
The number of subject in these cities ranged from 2350 to 2950 
persons with a response rate more than 70%. The program of 
study and its methods were presented in detail in previously 
published papers [8, 9]. Uniform criteria of the level of RF 
were used for all centers in the analysis of the data. A level 
of arterial pressure (AP) of 160/95 mm Hg and above (WHO 
criteria) corresponded to arterial hypertension (AH). The 
assessment of the presence dyslipoproteinemias (DLP) was based 
on the following criteria: a total blood cholesterol level of 
250 mg/dl and above corresponded to hypercholesterolemia (HCH); 
a blood level of total triglycerides of 200 mg/dl and above 
corresponded to hypertriglyceridemia (HTG); and a level of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL CH) of 35 mg/dl and 
below corresponded to hypoalphacholesterolemia (hypo-_a_-HDL 
CH) 
[22]. A body weight index [body weight (BWI) (in 
kg)/height[.sup]2[/] (in m)] of 29.5 kg/m[.sup]2[/] and 
above corresponded to excessive body weight (EBW) [12]. Any man 
smoking at least one cigarette per day was considered a smoker. 
All methods were carefully standardized before the beginning of 
the investigation, and quality control was constantly carried 
out during the investigation. Quality control of the lipid 
studies carried out in all centers was performed by the 
Department of Standardization of Biochemical Research Methods of 
the All-Russian Scientific Research Center of Preventive 
Medicine of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. 
  Results 
  Data on the prevalence of RF (separately and in various 
combinations) in men aged 20-54 years are presented in Table 1. 
The per cent of individuals with one RF was minimal in 
populations of Bishkek and Kiev (26.1 and 28.6, respectively), 
and maximal in men from Moscow and St. Petersburg (42.8 and 
45.1, respectively). Smoking was the most frequently identified 
RF in the populations in question; its frequency ranged from 
13.0 (Bishkek) to 34.5% (St. Petersburg). DLP occupied 
second 
place in prevalence among the RF. This indicator was lowest in 
men from Novosibirsk and highest in the male population of 
Bishkek (3.1% versus 9.9%, respectively). The 
prevalence of 
DLP ranged from 4.1 to 6.3% in other populations. AH came 
next 
in the prevalence of RF, ranging from 1.9% in Tashkent to

Note. Here and in Tables 2 and 3, the age-standardized indicator is cited. Standard - the male population of the CIS aged from 20 to 54 years. 


  The prevalence of a combination consisting of two RF was 
minimal in the men in Alma-Ata, maximal in Kiev (18.5 and 
30.5%, respectively). The combination of DLP and smoking 
was 
the most frequent combination of two RF in the populations 
examined, in particular, 8.9 and 14.0%, respectively, in 
Moscow 
and Tashkent. The combination of DLP and AH came next: its 
frequency was minimal among the men of Alma-Ata (0.9%), 
and 
maximal among the men of Bishkek (5.3%). The frequency of 
identification of the combinations of AH and EBW and EBW and 
smoking was somewhat lower. 
  The prevalence of a combination consisting of three RF was 
minimal among the men of Alma-Ata (2.7%), and maximal 
among the 
men of Tallinn (7.8%). DLP, smoking, and AH were included 
most 
frequently in a combination of three RF; such a combination was 
found in 0.8% of subjects from Alma-Ata and 3.3% 
of subjects 
from Tallinn. The combination of DLP, EBW, and AH was 
encountered somewhat less frequently: in 0.4% of men from 
Alma-Ata and 3.1% of subjects from Tallinn. The 
combination of 
RF consisting of AH, EBW, and smoking was minimal and maximal in 
Bishkek and Kiev (0.4 and 1.6%, respectively). There were 
overall RF in more than 70% of men studied from 
Novosibirsk and 
Tallinn. RF were observed in the male populations of Moscow and 
St. Petersburg in 68.3 and 69.6%, respectively. A lower RF 
prevalence was observed in men of the Central Asian region (in 
Bishkek, Tashkent, and Alma-Ata, respectively, 64.6, 69.9, and 
61.2%). 
  Data on the prevalence of RF separately and in various 
combinations in the men as a function of the character of their 
work activity are presented in Table 2. The presence of a single 
RF was identified more often in men engaged in physical labor; 
substantial differences in this connection were observed in 
workers doing physical and mental labor in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, and Alma-Ata. At the same time, the 
frequency of identification of smoking among the populations was 
substantially higher in physical laborers. The prevalence of AH 
alone was higher in intellectual workers in the populations from 
Tallinn, Kiev, and Novosibirsk. The frequency of identification 
of EBW did not depend on the character of work activity with the 
exception of men from Tashkent, where EBW was found twice as 
often among intellectual workers.

  A combination of two RF was found significantly more often 
in 
physical laborers only in the populations from Moscow, Tallinn, 
and Bishkek. In the remaining cities the combination of two RF 
did not depend on the character of the work activity of the men. 
The most frequent combination in both intellectual workers and 
physical laborers was the combination of DLP and smoking. This 
combination of RF was observed substantially more often in 
physical laborers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, and Tashkent. The combination of RF comprised of 
DLP and EBW was also identified substantially more often in men 
engaged in physical labor from St. Petersburg and Tallinn. At 
the same time, the combination of DLP and AH was found 
substantially more often in intellectual workers among the 
subjects from St. Petersburg. Other combinations of two RF in 
the populations did not depend on the character of the menUs 
work activity. 
  The prevalence of RF combinations consisting of three RF was 
higher in the majority of populations in physical laborers, but 
a significant difference was observed only in the subjects from 
St. Petersburg and Kiev. DLP, AH, and smoking were included in 
the combination of three RF most often. 
  Overall, in all of populations studied, such RF as DLP, AH, 
EBW, and smoking, were observed individually and in various 
combinations more often in physical laborers. It should be 
emphasized that RF combinations were encountered in both 
intellectual workers and physical laborers substantially more 
often in populations living in the European part of the CIS and 
Siberia, while the frequency of identification of RF was 
significantly lower in men from the Central Asian region. 
  Comparative data on the prevalence of RF individually and in 
various combinations as a function of the educational level of 
the men are presented in Table 3. The presence of one RF was 
observed substantially more often in Moscow, Tallinn, and 
Alma-Ata in individuals with secondary and elementary education. 
RF were recorded individually more often in men with elementary 
education among those from Tallinn and Novosibirsk. DLP was 
found significantly more frequently in men with higher education 
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, Alma-Ata, and Bishkek. 
Whereas, the frequency of smoking was substantially higher in 
individuals with elementary education in Moscow, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, and Alma-Ata. Further, the prevalence of smoking in 
men in Moscow, Tallinn, and Alma-Ata with elementary and 
secondary education was higher than in individuals with higher 
education. The frequency of identification of smoking in men 
with higher and secondary education from St. Petersburg and 
Bishkek was significantly higher than in individuals with 
elementary education. The prevalence of AH separately was 
somewhat greater in individuals with higher education, but 
significant differences were observed only in Tallinn and 
Novosibirsk. The presence of RF individually in the male 
population from Tashkent did not depend on the educational 
level. Smoking was the most prevalent RF in the men; its 
frequency was higher in individuals with elementary education, 
whereas DLP and AH were encountered somewhat more often in men 
with secondary and higher education.

  Combinations of two RF were encountered more often in 
Moscow, 
Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, and Tashkent in individuals with 
elementary education. The prevalence of a combination of two RF 
was higher in the men of St. Petersburg and Bishkek only in 
individuals with secondary education. A combination of two RF in 
Moscow in men with elementary and secondary education was 
identified significantly more frequently than in men with higher 
education. DLP and smoking were included in a combination of two 
RF most often. Such a combination was observed more often in 
subjects with elementary education in Tallinn, Alma-Ata, 
Novosibirsk, and Tashkent. The prevalence of the combination of 
AH and smoking was also higher in men with elementary education 
among the subjects from Moscow and Novosibirsk. The combination 
of DLP and AH was encountered significantly more often in men 
with higher education in Tallinn and Novosibirsk. The prevalence 
of such RF combinations as AH and EBW and EBW and smoking did 
not depend on the menUs educational level. 
  The prevalence of combinations if three RF overall did not 
depend on the menUs educational level, although there was a 
tendency in the majority of the populations to the more frequent 
identification of a combination of three RF and individuals with 
elementary education (see Table 3). 
  RF were observed significantly more frequently in 
individuals 
with elementary education in the populations of Moscow, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, and Tashkent; they were identified at a 
frequency ranging from 65.3 to 81.5%. The prevalence of 
RF in 
Moscow, Tallinn, and Alma-Ata in men with secondary education 
was substantially higher than in individuals with higher 
education, but at the same time lower than in men with 
elementary education. RF were identified significantly more 
often in the men of St. Petersburg and Bishkek in those with 
secondary education. The prevalence of RF in Kiev was 
significantly higher in individuals with secondary education 
than in those with higher and elementary education. At the same 
time, the frequency of identification of RF in men with higher 
education from Kiev was substantially higher than in individuals 
with elementary education. 
  Thus, the results of the investigations suggest that RF as a 
whole, depending on the character of the work activity and 
educational level of the men, were encountered more often among 
populations living in the cities of the European region, 
Siberia, and less often, in men of the Central Asian region. The 
highest prevalence of RF individually and in various 
combinations, as well as in relation to the character of work 
and educational level, was observed in the men from Novosibirsk 
and Tallinn. 
  Discussion 
  It was established, when populations of men were examined on 
the basis of a unified program and standard methods, that there 
were RF separately and in various combinations in the majority 
of the men in cities of various regions of the CIS and Estonia; 
at the same time, the level of RF was higher in the cities of 
the European part and Siberia, while RF were recorded 
substantially less frequently in the men of the Central Asian 
region. Smoking and DLP were most prevalent among the RF studied 
in the populations. DLP and smoking were included in a 
combination of two RF most often; DLP, smoking, and AH, in a 
combination of three RF. Very similar data have also been 
obtained in other population studies. Thus, RF were found when 
men 20-59 years of age in Moscow were examined in 76%; at 
the 
same time, smoking was the most prevalent RF [12]. Similar data 
have been obtained for other populations as well [2, 5, 20]. 
When 522 inhabitants of the island of Newfoundland were 
examined, RF were identified in 78%; HCH (61% at 
CH criteria 
&gt;  200 mg/dl), EBW, and smoking were encountered most 
frequently 
[23]. 
  RF were observed more often in our investigation in physical 
laborers. Differences in the RF level among intellectual workers 
and physical laborers were determined first of all by a higher 
frequency of smoking and its combinations with DLP and AH. In 
other investigations carried out in populations from the CIS, 
also among men engaged in physical labor, a higher prevalence of 
smoking and its combinations with other RF was observed [3, 13, 
15]. Data are available regarding the higher prevalence of RF 
individually and in various combinations among workers of 
industrial enterprises of Norilsk [16]. 
  When the men were studied in relation to educational level, 
we established that the frequency of RF individually and in 
different combinations has an inverse relationship to the 
educational level. The highest level of RF is observed in the 
majority of populations in individuals with elementary 
education; a lower level, in men with higher education. A 
similar relationship of the prevalence of RF as a function of 
educational level was identified in populations from Minneapolis 
(USA) and Australia [28, 29]. 
  Conclusions 
  1. For men living in various cities of the CIS, a high 
prevalence of risk factors (RF) individually and in various 
combinations, is characteristic; at the same time, the RF level 
is substantially higher in men from the European part and 
Siberia than in populations from the Central Asian region. 
  2. In descending order with respect to frequency of 
identification, the following RF are most prevalent among the 
men of the various cities of the CIS: smoking, 
dyslipoproteinemia (DLP), arterial hypertension (AH), and 
excessive body weight (EBW). DLP and smoking are included in a 
combination of two RF most often; DLP, AH, and smoking in a 
combination of three. 
  3. The prevalence of RF individually and in various 
combinations depends on the character of the work activity of 
the men: the level of RF is higher in men engaged in physical 
labor than in individuals engaged in intellectual work. 
  4. The prevalence of RF separately and in various 
combinations as a function of educational level, exhibits an 
inverse relationship: the highest RF level is observed in men 
with elementary education, the lowest in men with higher 
education.

  [Text] Growth of industrialization in the world was marked 
over the last 100 years by extremely fast increase in power 
consumption (by almost 25 times), which led to the use of 11.4 
billion tonnes of equivalent fuel in the world annually. 
However, in addition to the positive effect of 
industrialization, there are also negative factors, and one of 
the main ones is pollution of the atmosphere and planetary 
climate change, evoked by disturbance of the atmosphere's gas 
composition and the radiant heat balance as a result of 
accumulation of the combustion products of fossil fuels in the 
atmosphere. 
  The principal components of atmospheric pollution are oxides 
of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon. The toxic effects of some 
substances released by enterprises and forming as a result of 
human economic activity are described in Table 1. 
  Power generating facilities are among the principal 
polluters 
of the atmosphere (approximately 30 percent) [2]. Power supply 
sources of the Belarusian Republic currently consume around 65 
million tonnes of equivalent fuel per year, with around 90 
percent of the fuel and energy resources being supplied from 
Russia. Extraction of fuel and energy resources locally in 
Belarus in 1985 totaled: petroleum--2.0 million tonnes, gas--0.2 
billion nm[.sup]3[/], peat--4.5 million tonnes. On the other 
hand consumption just by power generating facilities, without 
regard for municipal heat supply sources not within the 
structure of the Belglavenergo TEO [not further identified], is 
shown in Table 2 [3]. 
  As follows from Table 2, the principal fuel of power 
generating facilities is fuel oil--48.7 percent. Consequently 
components released into the atmosphere as a result of its 
combustion, namely ash, soot, nitric oxides, sulfur dioxides and 
carbon monoxide, will be the environmental pollutants associated 
with generation of electric power in the Belarusian Republic.

  The concentration of toxic releases is determined by public 
health norms. Most important are the maximum one-time and the 
mean daily maximum permissible concentrations (PDKs) of toxins 
in the atmosphere. Table 3 gives the PDKs for several 
atmospheric pollutants adopted in the Belarusian Republic 
(PDK[.sup]max o[/]--one-time, PDK[.sub]m[/]--mean daily). 
  In order to meet the PDKs indicated in Table 3, we need to 
organize the fuel combustion process or provide the technology 
of purifying the fuel or the smoke gases. As a rule, for 
practical purposes the problems of purifying exhaust gases at 
power supply sources planned in countries of the former USSR 
were not addressed, and all of the attention was devoted to the 
fuel combustion process. However, while we can reduce toxic 
releases of N0[.sup]x[/] by improving the combustion process, 
SO[.sup]2[/] practically remains at its initial 
concentrations. Therefore to reduce toxic releases of 
SO[.sup]2[/], we need to furnish power supply sources using 
fossil fuel with purification systems. This of course makes the 
supplied electric power more expensive, but it improves the 
ecological situation at the locations of the power supply 
sources, and consequently reduces the risk of illness in the 
population.

  There are presently a rather large number of methods of 
removing SO[.sup]2[/] from gaseous releases. Some 
characteristics of these methods are given in Table 4. 
  As follows from Table 4, the SO[.sup]2[/] removing systems 
considered here are approximately identical in terms of their 
relative indicators. However, the cathode-ray methods do not 
require expendable materials, and moreover, they provide for 
comprehensive removal of NO[.sup]x[/] and SO[.sub]2[/] 
[5,6]. Furnishing power supply sources using fossil fuel with 
systems for removing toxic gaseous exhausts makes the supplied 
power 40-50 percent more expensive. It should be considered, 
however, that in this case the amount of the fines for toxic 
releases decreases. 
  Because many industrial enterprises, including those 
generating electric and thermal power, are unable to reduce 
releases below the PDV [maximum permissible release], on 11 May 
1990 the Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Republic adopted 
Decree No 119 ``On Standards of Charges for Releases 
(Discharges) of Pollutants Into the Natural Environment.'' The 
charges were introduced with the purpose of compensating for 
releases at the level of the PDV, with a coefficient of 0.1 for 
thermal power facilities, and a charge five times greater for 
surpassing them, depending on the danger class of the toxic 
substances. Table 5 gives the danger classes for toxic 
substances released together with smoke gases by power supply 
sources using high-sulfur fuel oil as fuel, and the cost per 
tonne of released substance.

  The damages caused by toxic releases from power supply 
sources burning high-sulfur fuel (around 20,000) [sic] were 
evaluated using procedures presented in [6-8]. The calculation 
results are shown in Table 6. 
  Considering that a tendency for land prices to increase is 
being observed, the amount of the damages will also grow. 
Consequently when planning and building power supply sources, we 
need to consider the damages inflicted both on the environment 
and on human health. For practical purposes the latter factor is 
not yet reflected in the procedural recommendations for 
calculating damages.

and Processing Systems''] 
  [Text] Under the conditions of today's scientific and 
engineering revolution, the development of mankind's productive 
forces has reached a level at which almost the entire surface of 
the planet is involved in the production process. Furthermore, 
industrial development of the country has run into the problem 
of a sharp deterioration in environmental conditions. 
  The resolution of environmental problems is closely related 
to the availability to the society of the hardware capable of 
effectively monitoring the conditions (parameters) of the 
environment and humans living in it. The tasks of this 
monitoring are diverse: determining the composition and 
concentrations of small impurities with a natural or man-made 
origin; measuring the physical environment condition parameters 
(temperature, pressure, moisture content, velocity of air and 
water masses, etc.); and examining the energy and mass transfer 
among the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. 
  This section of the journal is primarily dedicated to the 
studies and developments carried out by the Taganrog Radio 
Engineering Institute (TRTI) in the field of environmental 
monitoring and medical and biological diagnostics of the 
functional status of humans. The Taganrog Radio Engineering 
Institute is one of the largest academic, scientific, and 
production complexes in the Northern Caucasian region and 
consists of an institution of higher learning, a scientific 
research institute, two design offices, an experimental pilot 
base, and problem-oriented and industrial laboratories. 
  In the framework of the republic-wide program of ``ecology 
and environmental protection in the Russian Federation,'' the 
Institute's scientists are developing sensors and transducers 
for monitoring the environmental parameters, hardware for remote 
sensing of the environment, computer and data networks, 
environmental information display systems, and expert systems 
for the on-line assessment and prediction of the environmental 
conditions. 
  The Institute has a considerable stock of research already 
completed in each of these fields as well as the necessary 
scientific potential and experimental base. Moisture content, 
temperature, pressure, water vapor, smoke, NO gas, and ammonium 
sensors have already been developed at the Institute. Elements 
of secondary transducers of physical quantities have been 
developed and manufactured in a micro-electronic form. Remote 
sensing methods have been implemented in radar and laser 
instruments for detecting and mapping the water surface 
contamination and soil moisture content and for detecting 
groundwater. Scientific and research work on developing a 
station for monitoring gas discharges, systems for collecting 
and processing environmental data, and nonlinear hydroacoustic 
instruments for remote measurement of the thickness of sludge 
deposits resulting from industrial enterprise discharges have 
been carried out at the complex. 
  Equipment and software for the diagnostic-recovery center 
are 
being developed and manufactured at the Institute; it contains 
the following: 

  -  a model of a computer-aided system for monitoring the 
health of workers under the conditions of their productive 
activity developed on the basis of a computer 
  -  a psychological and physiological status simulator developed 
on 
the basis of a microcomputer together with a color graphics 
display and a module for recording physiological parameters 
(pulse rate, breathing rate, temperature, and skin potential) as 
well as electric stimulation facilities; 
  -  a SKENAR-type energy neurostimulator which was developed and 
manufactured for measured application of electric pulses for 
therapeutic purposes on reflexogenic segments of the skin cover 
in patients with diseases of the peripheral nervous system, 
skeletomuscular system traumas, or to be used as an auxiliary 
facility in respiratory diseases, in the initial stages of 
cardiovascular system diseases; it will be used starting from 
the foundation of scientific research, subsequent execution of 
experimental design work on its basis, and all the way to the 
production of pilot prototypes and pilot batches of the 
instruments being developed. Moreover, the Taganrog Radio 
Engineering Institute complex has accumulated considerable 
potential in the field of information science and computer 
science which makes it possible to automate the collection and 
processing of environmental and medical and biological data and 
develop a system of regional ecological data banks and knowledge 
bases. This is especially important since contacts have been 
made at an international level: a joint Soviet-Italian 
enterprise, contacts with Czecho-Slovakia, contacts with 
Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany, etc. 
  This issue of the journal contains applied articles 
dealing with the problem of monitoring the environmental 
parameters recommended for publication by the scientific and 
engineering seminar ``Radiophysical Methods in Environmental 
Research'' and by the coordinating center for organizing 
scientific research at the RSFSR State Committee on Science and 
Higher Education. 
  Moreover, the issue also contains the findings of research 
in 
related fields carried out by scientists from other institutions 
of higher learning.

  [Text]The sorry state of ecology makes even natural 
foodstuffs less and less suitable for consumption. And industry 
has to carry out increasingly thorough purification of such 
food. In particular, milk is usually treated with ion-exchange 
resins. These sorbents have the remarkable capacity to absorb 
numerous impurities: radionuclides, pesticides, heavy metals, 
and even excessive acidity, thus transforming ``poor'' milk into 
milk that is quite suitable for boiling. 
  Until recently, only small batches of milk intended for 
small 
children were submitted to such treatment, but after Chernobyl 
its' use increased dramatically in a number of oblasts. Then 
there appeared the problem of disposing of radioactive waste, 
which is quite sizable with use of this technology. Ion-exchange 
resins must be cleaned periodically in salt solutions, which 
then become the radioactive waste, which is quite significant 
(about 10 percent of the volume of treated milk) and hazardous 
(because of the high cesium-137 content). 
  The Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian Academy of 
Sciences, together with the All-Union Research Institute of the 
Dairy Industry were able to "take care of" radioactive salt 
solutions by including their treatment in the technological 
process. For this purpose, a new sorbent was developed, a 
modified zeolite that selectively binds expressly cesium-137. 
True, it becomes radioactive waste after use, but its volume is 
one-fiftieth of the level in salt solutions. 
  The modified zeolite can also be used for direct removal of 
cesium-137 from milk. This is particularly valuable for farmers 
who do not handle large batches of milk, but have enough time to 
inactivate it for a somewhat longer decontamination. Especially 
since, in this case, no special equipment is required. The 
sorbent does not get clogged with either protein or fat. The 
treatment method has been tested at the Moscow Medical Academy 
imeni I. M. Sechenov and its use is recommended. 
  It is technologically simple and inexpensive to manufacture 
the modified zeolite. The base material, naturally occurring 
zeolite, is available in sufficient amounts in the nation. But, 
unfortunately, there is no manufacturer as yet.

Academy, and V.D. Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences,

  [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification 
of production, the problem of environmental protection and 
rational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly 
socially and economically significant. Included among the 
matters classified under this problem are the following: 
pollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic 
chemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful 
consequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and 
diseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and 
recultivation; further development of the legal bases of 
environmental protection; and economic assessment of natural 
resources. 
  The development of production, scientific and engineering 
progress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not 
destroy the harmony that has been established in nature or 
destroy natural resources. There are no wastes in nature: All 
biological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed 
circle. 
  All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some 
degree or other. Research has shown that at least one third of 
all processible raw material is now transformed into finished 
products. Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials 
becomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment. In the 
past decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the 
atmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial 
development has increased sharply and continues to increase. 
Each year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power 
plants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and 
other machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in 
the form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the 
atmosphere. 
  The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world 
is 
absorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium 
in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been 
upset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding 
louder with each passing year. The continuing increase in the 
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an 
especially negative phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is known to be 
toxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated 
respiration and cardiac activity. An increase in carbon dioxide 
concentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also 
facilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal 
radiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate 
warming throughout the entire planet. As is known, in the past 
100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface 
increased by 0.5-0.6Î, which has in turn accelerated glacial 
thawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m. 
  Also released along with carbon dioxide during the 
combustion 
process is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect 
and which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, 
including illness of the central nervous system. 
  Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large 
amount of sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels also contain a great deal 
of sulfur. Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are 
released in our country. When sulfur dioxide reacts with 
atmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form. When 
nitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed 
that combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and 
nitric acids. These acids may cause serious lung diseases. 
  Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated 
on the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the 
atmosphere. 
  In nature, everything is interconnected. Toxic impurities 
that end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of 
precipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and 
vegetable gardens. Polluted precipitation also falls into water 
reservoirs. The acids contained in precipitation react with 
metals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc.) in the soil, and 
they infect the water and thus the fish. 
  Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution. 
Industrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into 
water reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes 
can no longer be cleaned with existing resources. The natural 
purity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost. 
Phosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as 
fertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them. 
The situation regarding irrigation water is no better. Its 
chemical composition largely dictates the quality of 
agricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, 
phosphates, and metals has also risen. Countries with a high 
technological discipline permit the use of relatively small 
amounts of fertilizer. In countries with a lower technological 
discipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase 
crop yields. As a rule, this results in a decline in product 
quality. 
  And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, 
the environment shortens their life. The child mortality rate in 
many countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries 
it has even begun to increase. Studies conducted by the World 
Health Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead 
content was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates. 
Where is the way out? 
  Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further 
destruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a 
planetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not 
to extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective 
capabilities. Understanding of the fact that people's lives 
truly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become 
widespread. 
  It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to 
regulate man's relationship with nature have been developed. In 
the developed countries, where the economy is subject to market 
relationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed 
intensively. This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, 
consequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. 
The manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust 
gases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities. 
  Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is 
being conducted at the international, state, and sector levels. 
Many countries regularly exchange information about the current 
condition of the environment and are creating a common 
ecological data bank. 
  Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently 
actively engaged in this process. And the situation in our 
country cannot be called good. According to existing data, about 
30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster 
areas. Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of 
restoring and protecting nature as priority problems. 
  Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more 
than two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements 
specified in standards. Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial 
wastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are 
transported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized 
storage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials 
ending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in 
infection of the plant and animal world. 
  Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy 
has long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is 
a definite contributor to these negative consequences of 
economic activity. 
  Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form 
of gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout 
the sector as a whole. From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units 
trap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 
tonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes 
throughout the country, are released into the atmosphere. 
Considering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located 
in cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough 
standards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely 
populated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect 
of the sector's production on the environment is not always 
adequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic 
materials. In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume 
percentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal 
power plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), 
painting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 
percent). The sector's production is characterized by a long 
list of wastes. And although solid particles and hydrocarbons 
predominate in the composition of toxic materials generated 
(they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual 
enterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and 
compounds into the air medium. 
  Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding 
and core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other 
wastes are generated at the sector's enterprises. Of that 
amount, 800,000 tons is toxic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of 
abrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, 
chromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for 
industry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are 
released each year. 
  According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector 
enterprises 
throughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated 
consists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and 
other types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum 
products (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 
percent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, 
slags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, 
highly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after 
regeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and 
varnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes. 
  The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's 
production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste 
technologies and equipment have not yet become basic and 
binding. It should be noted, however, that the sector's 
institutes are definitely working in this direction. 
  The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless 
melting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting 
by using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible 
to significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce 
the toxicity of wastes (slags). Also noteworthy from the 
standpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the 
toxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a 
process and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of 
aluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in 
layers. The process has been introduced on a wide scale at 
aviation industry enterprises and in other sectors. 
  Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of 
titanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder 
obtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way. 
This will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins). 
  From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and 
equipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of 
casting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, 
and neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them 
at sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work. 
  In the past few years, the following ecologically promising 
low-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components 
have been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of 
components used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws 
and cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating 
magnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum 
or sulfur hexafluoride gas). This has made it possible to cut 
emissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3. 
  In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; 
Defectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector 
enterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following 
low-waste processes and equipment: 
  -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic 
cutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of 
grinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine 
materials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration 
of cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil 
residues from the water in spent cutting fluids. The cost 
savings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles; 
  -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing 
coatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that 
has made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a 
factor of 5 or 6; 
  -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of 
blades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent; 
  -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics 
(glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the 
manufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises 
instead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's 
type); 
  -- a process for finishing precision components of 
fuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of 
finishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced 
consumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into 
the atmosphere by a factor of 3. 
  In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the 
following have been developed: 
  -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness 
based on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication 
instead of the oil-and-whiting method; 
  -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of 
pneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized 
water and a stand for comprehensive development of 
pneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas 
(nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive 
helium. 
  In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce 
television-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was 
done in 1990-1992. This type of inspection may replace the x-ray 
and magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of 
magnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the 
use of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the 
inspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and 
fixative wastes. In the case of the television-magnetic method, 
there are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple 
times. 
  Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible 
to 
reduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, 
nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere, eliminate 
contamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly 
flammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the 
volatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the 
sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of 
water sources by petroleum products, etc. 
  Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with 
respect to ecological improvement of production and creation of 
new low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above 
data, still difficult to call this activity purposive and 
effective. 
  To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise 
during aviation operations. The "greenhouse" gases 
CO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides 
form as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine. Efforts are 
currently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce 
nitrogen oxide wastes. 
  The only way of significantly reducing or completely 
eliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such 
as liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen. The development of 
cryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate 
aviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves. 
  Development and assimilation of the following 
processes/equipment are planned as priority directions of 
ecological improvement over the next few years: 
  -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash 
components and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of 
commercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other 
health-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it 
possible to economize fuel and raw material resources; 
  -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer 
coatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic 
field that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent 
vapors and aerosols in the atmosphere; 
  -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium 
used when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine 
components by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that 
will result in an ecologically pure technological process; 
  -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure 
technological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory 
alloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor 
of 6-8; 
  -- a process and automated chambers for 
microcomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of 
coatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process 
by 25 percent on average. 
  These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the 
following: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed 
dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere; 
eliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; 
improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate 
pollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and 
reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products. 
  The development of science-intensive processes and equipment 
and their introduction into industry are still far from 
adequate. One of the main distinguishing features of 
science-intensive technologies and production is the fact that 
they require little raw material and energy (i.e., they are more 
resource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are 
used are not great. Water consumption in these processes is also 
much lower than in conventional industrial processes, which 
ultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage. 
  Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, 
and progressive casting are among those resource-saving 
low-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially 
significant for the sector's production on an ecological plane. 
  The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these 
problems is another very important reason why the work that is 
being done with respect to ecological improvement of industry 
and creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes 
has not been effective enough. 
  According to the standard international classification 
system, the aviation sector is among the 10 most 
science-intensive sectors. It is understood that the task of 
switching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste 
processes in the present period under the conditions of the 
systems of economic relationships that have developed in the 
sector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and 
large become the main source of financing R&amp;D, is rather 
difficult. 
  One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a 
systems approach is that of developing a special integrated 
environmental protection program. The foundation of this program 
consists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the 
sector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving 
low-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all 
stages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the 
purpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility. 
  The technological measures planned by the sector should be 
based on priority directions, including those in the field of 
ecological improvement of the sector's production as determined 
first and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of 
production and processes, and materials with the biggest 
negative effect on the environment. 
  The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology 
program must contain a number of subprograms in different 
directions of environmental protection activity. Specifically, 
each subsector must have a separate program of operations to 
create a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and 
neutralizing production and consumption wastes. 
  Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of 
attention as a tool that makes it possible to make a 
scientifically well founded decision regarding the need to 
develop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and 
further develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, 
equipment, and materials that are in use. 
  In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it 
possible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible 
negative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of 
the sector's production on the environment. What is needed most 
on this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector 
institutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of 
the methodological, standards and related reference information, 
and technical-organizational support of such an expert 
evaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and 
enterprises. The expert evaluation should be based on a 
comprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several 
directions, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's 
atmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc. 
  The sector's institutes now have the materials required to 
conduct expert evaluations. For example, they now have the 
following: normative-reference material related to determining 
indicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's 
manufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of 
all industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to 
the basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with 
consideration for its quality; a method of calculating the 
quantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials 
into the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing 
equipment at the sector's enterprises; a 
normative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of 
materials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors 
for use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector 
methodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions 
form aircraft engines. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health 
and other industrial sectors also have a number of 
methodological materials. 
  A group of environmental protection specialists at the NIID 
are conducting a systematic check of completed scientific 
research work and newly developed and improved technological 
processes to analyze their effect on the environment and their 
conformity to the requirements of environmental protection 
legislation so as to prevent the introduction of technological 
processes that do not meet the requirements of environmental 
protection and rational use of natural resources. 
  The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and 
in enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the 
required body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great 
importance in this respect. 
  Only when specialists have in-depth knowledge of the 
interaction of nature and society, the consequences of 
industrial pollution of the environment, rational methods and 
ways of using nature, the requirements of environmental 
protection legislation, ways of protecting the environment 
against industrial emissions, ways of estimating the damage done 
to nature, and other matters will they be capable of actively 
introducing expert ecological examinations into the sector, 
increasing its quality, and consequently producing a product 
that is not ecologically harmful. 
  Purposive and effective work toward ecological improvement 
of 
the sector's production based on resource-saving and low-waste 
technology is impossible without significant improvement of 
organizational work in this direction. 
  In this regard, special attention must be paid to developing 
organizational methodological materials to support the use of 
recyclable material resources in the national economy. 
  The problem of increasing the effectiveness and rational use 
of recyclable material resources is one of the most important 
problems in the sector's production. Hundreds of thousands of 
tons of recyclable material resources pile up at the sector's 
enterprises each year. Table 1 presents the volumes of the 
generation, use, and destruction of recyclable material 
resources in the sector in 1991. It is evident from Table 1 that 
between 4 and 83 percent of recyclable material resources is 
destroyed depending on the type of resource. The main thrust of 
the sector's economic strategy is effective use of recyclable 
material resources in production, the main directions of which 
are presented in Table 2.

  [Text] Note: RMR = recyclable material resources. 
  [Text] Solving this problem requires a new systems approach 
to using 
all recyclable material resources. Recently, the recovery of raw 
material resources from wastes has become a matter of 
governmental importance in many developed countries. Unused 
recyclable material resources require significant expenditures 
for storage (or burial). In addition, burying them aggravates 
the ecological situation. 
  Reducing the volume of industrial wastes and making rational 
use of them reduces the size of dumps and the costs of 
maintaining them. About 2 million hectares of land in our 
country are currently used as dumps. The dumps become full in an 
average of 4-5 years, after which new dump sites must be found. 
The territory occupied by dumps can only be recovery after 10-20 
years. The area of land withdrawn from circulation is therefore 
constantly increasing. 
  Today, it is important that the public understand that 
the solution to economic and ecological problems is not 
purification equipment, on which enormous funds are spent, but 
rather no-waste technology and reprocessing of recyclable 
material resources. 
  When recyclable material resources are reprocessed, 
environmental pollution is reduced by 40-45 percent versus when 
primary resources are used, and capital expenditures are 4-5 
times lower than the costs of obtaining and processing 
comparable types of primary resources. Obtaining 1 ton steel 
from scrap metal, for example, requires 80 percent less energy 
than the entire cycle to produce steel from iron ore does. 
Reusing 100 million bottles makes it possible to save 30,000 
tons of sand, 10,000 tons of soda, 6,000 tons of oil, 18 million 
kwh of electric power, and 15 million m[.sup]3[/] of gas. 
Producing 1 tonne of lubricating oils based on spent product 
will save 6 tons of oil, and 1 ton of rag wool will yield about 
700 kg of recovered wool. Using waste paper when manufacturing 
paper makes it possible to reduce air pollution by 46 percent 
and water pollution by 25-45 percent. 
  When assessing the feasibility of investing large 
amounts of funds in the creation of some new facilities to 
produce different types of products, it is thus necessary to 
bear in mind that in most cases it is much more advantageous 
from both economic and ecological standpoints to spend funds to 
improve existing production processes through more in-depth 
processing of raw material. In such cases, the amount of 
additional product may be produced in much shorter time periods 
and at a lower cost. In addition, toxic emissions into the 
environment are significantly reduced. 
  It should be noted that the existing methods of estimating 
the use of production wastes and their demand only consider the 
savings from selling the additional product obtained. The scales 
of the true effect of introducing a recovery process are 
depressed because the reduction of economic damage due to 
environmental pollution is not considered. 
  The total savings from using recyclable material resources 
consists of the profit obtained from selling the product made of 
recyclable material resources, eliminating their removal and 
burial costs, reducing transport costs, freeing ground occupied 
by dumps and disposal sites, and reducing expenditures on 
environmental protection. Socio-economic criteria that give 
consideration to both the effect of producing a product and the 
social results of preventing the release of toxic materials into 
the environment must be used when estimating the savings 
resulting from using recyclable material resources. 
  Extraction and processing of materials for use in the very 
same production processes for the second and, in some cases, the 
third time is the main direction in making use of industrial 
wastes abroad. The membrane process and ion-exchange method have 
gained the greatest popularity. Specifically, they permit 
economically profitable processing of effluent after 
electrochemical treatment of solutions both with a low salt 
content (when units are washed) and in concentrated solutions 
(spent electrolytes). 
  For effluent with a low salt content, an ion-exchange filter 
is used. After that, the purified and desalinated (up to 90 
percent) water is returned to the unit for electrochemical 
treatment, and the concentrate is subjected to additional 
treatment either for regeneration and reuse or else for 
neutralization. Japanese specialists have developed ion-exchange 
filters for continuous purification of the washing waters of 
electrochemical processing units. The filter has ion-exchange 
cassettes or replaceable-type cartridges.

  Methods based on the membrane process are considered more 
promising for concentrated solutions. Different types of 
electrolyzers, i.e., with plate-type and three-dimensional 
porous electrodes, are used in the units created in Germany and 
Japan. Filter elements based on hollow fibers produced by the 
American firms Dupont, Westinghouse, and Dow Chemical have 
become popular. Sleeve-type membranes produced by the firm 
General Dynamics (the United States) made of the drain material 
Tricot with a packing density of 720 
m[.sup]2[/]/m[.sup]3[/] are in demand. 
  Wastes from the production of printed circuit boards are 
widely used abroad for electrochemical regeneration of 
cuprammonium solutions in electrolyzers in which the anode and 
cathode spaces are separated by an ion-exchange membrane. During 
the regeneration process, the spent solution circulates 
continuously in the anode chamber, where it is oxidized and 
returned to the etcher. Copper ions pass through the membrane 
into the cathode chamber, where they are deposited on the 
cathode in the form of a metal powder. The unit has a capacity 
of 3 kg of pure copper per hour (the URT-901 unit used in the 
sector has a capacity of 1 kg/h). The firms Finishing Service 
(Great Britain) and Gell-Muller (Germany) series-produce units 
for electrochemical regeneration combined with alkaline etching 
lines. 
  About 240 million old tires are discarded in the United 
States each year. As secondary materials, they are burned as 
fuel, used to manufacture rough home flooring and landing mats 
for aircraft, mixed with asphalt and used in laying sidewalks, 
used to manufacture drain pipes and enclosures, etc. In 
addition, the state of Pennsylvania is conducting a project to 
activate used rubber so as to chemically bind it with plastics 
for the purpose of transforming old rubber into a polymeric 
composite material suitable for manufacturing hoses, gaskets, 
rollers, and even new tires. The method entails grinding worn 
tires into powder and adding it to plastics to form a composite 
mixture. Calculations performed at the NIID indicate that more 
than 90 percent of wastes may be reprocessed and used in the 
interests of the national economy. 
  Ninety percent of wastes from the sawmilling and woodworking 
industry are used, as are 98 percent of polystyrene wastes. The 
savings of primary polystyrene thanks to the use of 1 tonne of 
secondary polystyrene averages 986 kg for the subsector. In the 
subsector, wastes from the sawmilling industry are used for 
manufacturing particle board and mail (postal) boxes, 
constructing temporary structures in the sector's own ancillary 
facilities, and selling to state farms and collective farms 
(sawdust) and the public (trim, slabs, and lumber that has 
already been used). Polystyrene wastes are used to produce 
components for basic production, industrial-engineering goods, 
cultural and general goods, and goods intended for sale in the 
economy. 
  Sector enterprises obtain some woodworking and polystyrene 
wastes from other enterprises in the region for processing and 
use in their own production. One plant, for example, has at its 
own initiative found a profitable method of reprocessing a large 
volume of sawmilling and woodworking wastes from enterprises of 
various sectors throughout the region. Yearly production of 
particle board averages 1,500 m[.sup]2[/] with an economic 
impact of 530,000 rubles yearly. Each year, the Vpered [Forward] 
Machine Building Plant in Moscow uses sawmilling and polystyrene 
wastes to manufacture hangers, motor vehicle and door handles, 
bread baskets, candlesticks, cutting boards, decorative 
spatulas, and small serving tables in quantities of 450,000 
units each year for an economic impact of 370,000 rubles. 
  The Gidromash [Hydraulic Machinery] Production Association 
(Nizhniy Novgorod) uses polystyrene wastes to produce household 
goods in quantities of 500,000 units each year with an economic 
impact of 420,000 rubles. It should be noted that enterprises in 
the subsector sell polystyrene wastes mainly to manufacturing 
organizations. A fairly insignificant amount of woodworking and 
sawmilling wastes are transported to dumps, buried, or destroyed. 
  The NIID has evaluated the ecological situation in the 
sector 
in relation to the recovery of slime wastes generated during the 
electrochemical treatment of gas turbine engine components and 
subassemblies. According to data obtained from sector 
enterprises, there is a total of 1,572 tons of slime each year. 
Of that amount, 251 tonnes are recovered, and the rest is 
transported to a dump. Titanium-containing slimes, which amount 
to 947 tons a year, are particularly valuable. It should be 
noted that the processing sectors of industry, for example, the 
paint-and-varnish and construction sectors, are not especially 
interested in this quantity of slime. The principles of no-waste 
technology require that these wastes be included in 
technological chains, however. The NIID has conducted an 
information search and identified 20 technologies in which 
recyclable material resources containing titanium slimes may be 
used. The MMPO imeni Chernyshev [expansion not given] and 
Nitrogen Industry Institute have, for example, developed a 
process for using titanium slimes to prepare Claus oxide 
catalyst to replace imported catalyst in sulfur production. The 
design of a shop to reprocess titanium slime to produce 
refractory alloys has been proposed at the Novomoskovsk Chemical 
Combine. 
  The use of worn-down mounted abrasive points is very 
important for our sector. A survey of enterprises revealed 2,545 
tonnes of such points generated during 1991. Enterprises in the 
sector use abrasive point wastes for various technological 
purposes. At the Salyut MMPO, for example, 24.5 percent of its 
120 tons of waste is sold to manufacturing organizations, and 
53.9 percent is recovered. Of the 125 tons of waste at the MMPO 
imeni Chernyshev, 84.3 percent is sold, 15.2 percent is 
recovered, and 0.5 percent is used in vibration tumblers. 
  Most worn-down mounted abrasive points are thus sold to 
manufacturing organizations, and only a small part are used for 
technological or production purposes. 
  Removal of an aluminized coating (during repair) and ceramic 
cores from single-crystal blades in a fluoride salt melt is a 
progressive direction. A significant amount of the slime 
generated after regeneration of the fluoride salts is used to 
produce construction materials. At the Rybinsk Motor Building 
Production Association, the economic impact from the 
introduction of this process has amounted to 462,000 rubles a 
year (in 1991 prices). 
  Several hundreds of tons of tungsten- and cobalt-containing 
wastes is generated each year at the subsector's enterprises 
during the process of pointing and using hard-alloy cutting 
tools. Eighty percent of the weight of all of the solid alloy 
obtained is in lump form, and 20 percent of the weight of the 
wastes from resharpened hard plates is in dust form. The 
enterprises and the NIID have jointly organized sections to 
collect the metal lumps and dust. The economic impact of the 
introduction of these sections has been about 180,000 rubles at 
each enterprise. 
  A technology for reprocessing wastes from grinding and 
pointing cutting tools made of high-speed steel is being 
developed at the institute. At the present time, between 8 and 
12 percent of the high-speed steel used ends up as grinding 
wastes, and up to 70 percent of the cutting portion of a cutting 
tool is ground away during resharpening. Enterprises transport 
these wastes to the dump, where iron and heavy metals (tungsten 
and molybdenum) oxidize and are subsequently leached out into 
the ground waters. Oxidation of chromium and vanadium result in 
the formation of toxic materials. The government pays gold for 
tungsten and molybdenum, and the enterprises send these metals 
into the environment. The newly developed technology makes it 
possible to recover steel powders isolated from the wastes by 
cyclones by remelting them (to produce cast components) and by 
the powder metallurgy method (to manufacture cutting tools). 
  Integrated solution of the problem of using recyclable 
material resources in the national economy will make it possible 
to significantly boost production efficiency and the degree of 
environmental protection. 
  The problem of protecting the environment and using natural 
resources rationally is thus extremely critical for Russia's 
current economy and demands the most in-depth attention and 
active participation on the part of the sector's scientific 
research institutes, associations, and enterprises.

  [Text]As a result of a number of natural 
disasters and technogenic accidents, global changes are 
presently occurring in man's environment, and this makes it 
necessary to develop a new scientific discipline, ecological 
psychology. Formation of radioecological psychology is taking 
place within its limits. The subject of radioecological 
psychology consists of objective facts, patterns and mechanisms 
of development of the human personality, his mental activity in 
the presence of complex interweaving of radioecological and 
sociopsychological factor related to the major nuclear accident 
at the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power plant]. Under such 
conditions, there is dramatic and prolonged mandatory change the 
lifestyle of millions of people, which leads to often 
misunderstood and largely dangerous changes in the mental aspect 
of their life. 
  Radioecological psychology is called upon to demonstrate the 
patterns and mechanisms of occurring changes, assess possible 
consequences and propose adequate ways and means of rendering 
psychological aid to people with consideration of their age-, 
sex-related, individual psychological and sociopsychological 
distinctions. Thus, radioecological psychology is an applied 
scientific discipline. 
  The distinctions of the subject and actual execution of 
deployed research determine the complex nature of formation of 
radio-ecological psychology, which is closely linked with 
psychophysiology, general, medical, age-related, pedagogic, and 
social psychology, as well as sociology, pedagogics, law and 
other disciplines. It utilizes the techniques of experimental 
psychology, psychohygiene, psychotherapy, etc. At the same time, 
within the mainstream of this scientific direction, it is 
developing its own theory, methodology, specific methods of 
investigation and correction of impaired mental development and 
behavior of people who have suffered from the sequelae of the 
radio-ecological disaster. 
  The social relevance and humanitarian orientation of this 
discipline are instrumental in close interaction between 
scientists and practitioners in different specialties residing 
not only in affected country but also in distant foreign lands. 
Beneficial scientific ties are being established between 
psychologists of Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine. Psychologists 
of England, Belgium, Hungary, Germany, the United States, 
France, Japan and other countries are displaying interest in 
these problems and expressing the desire to give scientific and 
practical aid [8]. The ``Children of Chernobyl'' project is 
being implemented under the aegis of UNESCO; it involves 
construction of a number of community centers for 
sociopsychological rehabilitation of children up to the age of 7 
years (in the Ukraine, in Vishnevyy, Kiev Oblast), and 
preparations are under way for opening a UNESCO international 
laboratory in Kiev to work on overcoming the socio-psychological 
and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  There is a history to the formation of radioecological 
psychology in the Ukraine. In the early days and months after 
the accident, it was impossible to determine the nature and 
extent of impact of the radioecological disaster on social and 
psychological phenomena, or to predict their dynamics without 
appropriate studies. 
  The earliest observations in 1986 (for example, those of A. 
U. Kharash from Moscow State University), and subsequent 
purposeful studies (in particular, of the staff of the Ukrainian 
Psychological Research Institute in 1987) were carried out by 
scientists at their own initiative [9]. The findings gave cause 
for serious concern about the social and psychological 
consequences of the accident. The results of observations, 
interrogations and special studies were reported in the form of 
papers and accounts relayed to superior agencies; however, the 
reaction to them was quite restrained, since the findings 
contradicted the official assessment of the sequelae of the 
Chernobyl accident. 
  A comparative study of more than 1300 3d, 5th, 7th and 9th 
grades students -- namely of: a) children evacuated from the 
30-km zone, b) those who remained in the zone of radioactive 
contamination in Zhitomir, Kiev and Chernigov oblasts, c) those 
residing in Kiev, d) a control group from Poltava Oblast -- 
carried out by 16 staff members of the Ukrainian Psychological 
Research Institute in 1987 revealed a number of statistically 
significant differences between them. Thus, the exposed 
students revealed decline in indicators of attention, memory, 
work capacity, impairment in volitional-emotional and emotional 
areas [1]. All this was indicative of sustained stress. Children 
and adolescents evacuated from the 30-km zone were in a 
particularly difficult situation: about 50 percent of them 
experienced serious difficulties in socio-psychological 
adjustment to their new place of residence [2, 3]. 
  A small research team was formed in 1988, which became the 
Children of Chernobyl scientific and practical center in 1990 
(headed by S. I. Yakovenko), to carry out further investigations 
at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute. Several 
articles and methodological recommendations were prepared on the 
basis of their studies [4, 5, 6]. 
  The next step toward deeper investigation of the 
socio-psychological consequences of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES was the Union-Republic Children of Chernobyl 
program approved in 1991. In spite of organizational and 
financial difficulties, it was possible to recruit the nation's 
leading scientific institutions to implement it. In the Ukraine, 
the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute was appointed as 
the head organization (director: A. V. Kirichuk), and 18 of the 
42 topical problems of this program were worked on there. The 
results of its research and clinical work carried out in 1991 
were summarized at the interregional scientific conference on 
``Socio-psychological Rehabilitation of Children and Adolescents 
Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster,'' which convened in February 
1992 in Kiev [8]. 
  The findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: 
The accident at the Chernobyl AES caused catastrophic changes in 
the ecological situation, radical breakdown of the age-old 
lifestyle, system of relations, and made substantial adjustments 
in people's value orientations (first of all, those dealing with 
attitude toward the environment, society, health and rearing 
children). 
  The psycho-traumatic situation that developed after the 
Chernobyl disaster enhanced "centrifugal tendencies" in 
personality development of children and adolescents, which was 
manifested by a tendency toward accentuation of temperament, 
diminished resistance to stress, increased aggressiveness and 
conflict in some, passivity, asthenization, formation of 
consummatory and pension-neurosis mindsets in others. 
  On the whole, the following developmental disturbances were 
typical in children and adolescents who suffered the 
consequences of the Chernobyl accident: --physical: 
asthenization, deterioration of indicators of physical 
readiness, early development of chronic diseases; --mental: 
stress, deadaptation, diminished attention, memory, work 
capacity (including mental work), volitional and emotional 
disturbances, nostalgia for the past and uncertainty about the 
future, diminished motivation, distorted self-appraisal, and 
others; --spiritual: existential crisis, difficulties in 
personal and professional self-assertion, formation and 
persistence of the helpless victim complex doomed to a short and 
difficult life; --social: increased aggressiveness, conflict; 
social apathy, difficulties in communicating (particularly in 
children evacuated from the 30-km condemned zone). 
  In other words, there was a large number of "children who 
had 
gone through a lot," which is not normal in peacetime. 
  At the same time, what had been experienced was, in a number 
of instances, instrumental in intensive formation of the 
personality of affected children and adolescents, appreciable 
improvement in family relations, and others. However, the 
existing positive facts have not yet been reliably aired in 
psychological publications. 
  The following tasks moved to the fore in solving problems of 
sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents in 
the zone of the Chernobyl catastrophe: --determination of 
factors and conditions that arose because of the Chernobyl 
disaster and prevent proper development of children and 
adolescents in the accident zone, and their relationship to 
other concurrently existing factors; --establishment of patterns 
of impact of the aggregate of all existing factors on mental 
development of different territorial and age groups of victims; 
--elaboration of an integral concept of providing for proper 
development of children and adolescents in the zone of the 
Chernobyl disaster; determination of scientific ally validated 
ways and means of rendering the necessary psychological aid to 
victims. 
  The most important factors that hinder proper development of 
children and adolescents in the accident zone are: --external 
and internal radioactive irradiation that is deleterious to 
health and particularly dangerous for children born in 1986; 
--unsatisfactory level of medical care of affected children, 
only 15 percent of whom are under clinical observation; 
--inadequate information given to the public about the 
radioecological situation, safety measures, health status, and 
results of scientists' studies; --distorted image of the 
Chernobyl disaster in the mass media, which are transformed into 
"mass mental traumatization" media, continued circulation of 
various rumors and conjectures that initiate social stress and 
personal anxiety, also affecting children; --deterioration of 
sociodemographic population indicators in the accident zone, 
which is being abandoned by the best educated people who are 
replaced by those who expect only benefits, housing and high 
wages; --erosion of family-relative relations, prolonged 
separation of parents and children during vacations, 
impossibility of restoring previous forms of organization of 
everyday work and leisure; --material and technical difficulties 
in organizing the educational-rearing process in public 
education institutions situated in the zone of rigid radiation 
monitoring (crowded cafeterias, no gyms, ancillary facilities, 
technical educational equipment, etc.), shortage of qualified 
personnel, overfatigue of pedagogues; --inadequate efficacy of 
sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents 
during vacations, its virtual absence at their place of 
residence; --shortage of funds and resources to implement laws 
and enforceable enactments called upon to provide social 
protection of victims, diminished attention given to the latter 
on the part of local authorities and the world community. 
  In assessing the prospects for overcoming the 
sociopsychological sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl 
AES, we must state that: 1) the sources of radiation hazard have 
not disappeared and their impact will probably last for tens of 
years; new victims of the disaster have also been found who were 
previously convinced that they were not involved in its 
consequences; 2) it is impossible to provide all victims with 
normal living conditions, good medical care, work in their 
special field, to compensate them for the material damage; 3) 
social tension persists in society due to the ``unfair'' 
distribution of benefits, humanitarian aid, etc.; 4) victims do 
not trust the authorities, mass media, scientists and 
specialists; 5) it was found that the victims have extremely 
limited opportunities to solve their problems; nor is there any 
effective State sociopsychological and legal aid for these 
people. 
  The reason for the existing situation is not only that the 
necessary funds and resources are wanting, but also there is a 
shortage of constructive ideas to be systematically implement, 
or a scientifically validated conception for eradication of the 
sociopsychological consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl 
AES. 
  In this respect, the only exception is the concept of 
providing for proper mental development of children and 
adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, which was 
developed at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute and 
approved by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. However, it 
requires further definition, since there are still not enough 
scientific data for accurate assessment of the 
sociopsychological and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the 
Chernobyl disaster and prediction of further development of the 
situation. 
  The information we have to date is fragmentary, and for this 
reason it is dangerous to draw far-reaching conclusions on its 
basis. Only one thing is apparent: we can make a distinction of 
at least nine subgroups among affected children, which differ in 
number, relocation, proportion of radioecological and 
psychotraumatic factors, and how the stress situation is 
experienced. They are: --1) those evacuated from the 30-km 
accident zone in 1986; --2) those living or who have lived in 
the zone of mandatory relocation; --3) those referred to the 
guaranteed relocation zone; --4) those living in regions of 
continuous radiometric monitoring; --5) those living on "safety 
islands," situated in the accident zone (Kiev, Slavugich and 
others), who do not, however, agree with this assessment of the 
situation, as well as: --6) children of "eradicators," who were 
born after their parents had fulfilled their civic duty; --7) 
"grandchildren of Chernobyl," i.e., children of the grown 
representatives of the above subgroups; --8) children and 
adolescents in "clean" territories, who were exposed to the risk 
of internal irradiation due to consumption of contaminated food; 
--9) children born in 1986 who were the most affected by the 
radiation factor. 
  A considerable number of children and adolescents of the 
Chernobyl zone were given the status of victims and have the 
right to expect the State's aid; the rest who have, so to speak, 
fallen through the cracks, have not undergone humanitarian 
socio-psychological expert evaluation. The reason is clear: not 
a single decision or enforceable enactment underwent expert 
humanitarian sociopsychological evaluation. 
  The program of further scientific and clinical work in 
1992-1995 aimed at eradicating the socio-psychological 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster covers the following: 
--organization of monitoring of the sociopsychological 
situation, mental development of a representative sample of 
children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, 
starting a distributed data bank in order to assess the 
situation and predict its future dynamics; --expert humanitarian 
evaluation of decisions pertaining to provision of appropriate 
living conditions for children and adolescents affected by the 
consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES, organization 
of the educational-rearing process in and beyond the area where 
they reside; --development, experimental trial and adoption of 
psychological-pedagogic recommendations to workers in public 
education and health care institutions, and parents of affected 
children; --establishment of an infrastructure of specialized 
institutions for socio-psychological rehabilitation of affected 
children and adolescents, provision of psychological 
consultations for them; --training and advanced training of 
personnel (clinical psychologists, pedagogues and social 
workers), providing them with scientific-methodological and 
psychological aid. 
  These tasks have been fulfilled to varying extents. In 1992, 
Kiev State University handed out diplomas of clinical 
psychologists to 140 people who were referred there from the 5 
most affected oblasts of the Ukraine. They returned to their 
homes to work with children in public education institutions and 
specialized psychorehabilitation offices, the network of which 
is already beginning to proliferate. In the future, it is 
planned to graduate 60 clinical psychologists annually from the 
specialized department of Kiev State University, who will be 
involved in implementation of the Children of Chernobyl program. 
  An agreement has been reached to organize training of 
psychologists from affected regions of the Ukraine at Fordham 
University in New York and the New Hope Guild Center also 
located there, which specializes in sociopsychological 
adaptation of migrants. 
  A program for organizing a network of regional 
psychorehabilitation centers in the Ukraine, a decree on 
regional centers and prototype plan to outfit them have been 
developed. 
  Methodological recommendations have been elaborated for: 
parents of affected children (M. I. Alekseyeva), preschool 
institutions for children from the zone of radioactive 
contamination (S. Ye. Kulachkovskaya), different types of 
schools situated in different zones of the Chernobyl disaster 
(I. L. Fedorishina, Yu. M. Shvalb and others), non-educational 
institutions called upon to provide conditions for creative 
development of children and adolescents living in radiation 
zones and unable to spend their free time in the usual way (V. 
V. Rybalka), as well as workers in health camps and rest homes 
where children of the Chernobyl zone spend long periods of time 
(M. I. Borishevskiy, I. M. Turchaninova). 
  Much work has been done in the field of methodological and 
software-hardware support of monitoring the sociopsychological 
situation, mental development of children affected by the 
sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster, and managing a distributed 
data bank (A. M. Karpukhina, V. G. Panok). 
  In 1993, the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute is 
joining in a comprehensive investigation of the adult population 
affected by the sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant.

  [Text] Is radioactive contamination dangerous to the health 
and life of Russia's population? Many, primarily in high 
management spheres, maintain that there is no reason to worry, 
that there are more important things. People living in 
contaminated regions and some scientists think otherwise since 
it has been discovered that low doses may probably be just as 
lethal as the high ones. 
  But more about this later, and in the meantime, we should 
reiterate that in the West, 0.1 rad per year is regarded as the 
safe limit for human health over a 70-year life span. This is 
close to the natural background of 10-20 ÊR/h. From the many 
units of measurements designating doses, we shall select the rad 
and the Curie. One rad is 100 erg of absorbed radiation per 1 g 
of substance. One Curie (Ci) is 
3.7[.sup].[/]10[.sup]10[/]decays of element nuclei per 
second: this is produced by 1 g of radium. 
Where Are We? 
  Demographic and medical statistics demonstrate that our 
genetic stock is in trouble. We have knocked out the fittest 
among us and spared the remaining ones. The weakened ones bred 
the sick ones. Today, we can hardly find 10% of perfectly 
healthy among the non-old. The population has been reproduced in 
an historically unprecedented fluctuating mode. The October 
[Revolution] engendered four catastrophic decreases in birth 
rates. The first one is still continuing, and since 1991, it has 
become deeper than the third decline, worse than the worst years 
of the last war. 
  The most poisoned country in the world, Russia is 
contaminating the biosphere with chemicals and radiation more 
than others. 
  Approximately 100 billion Ci of radioactive poison has been 
accumulated in the world and approximately half of this is ours. 
Some of it we discharged into the sea--twice as much as the rest 
of the world. Part of it we poured into the reservoirs. No one 
except us dares to store radiation in an open form. In the 
Urals' Lake Karachay alone, 120 MCi has been accumulated. Are we 
waiting for a stronger wind? In Chelyabinsk-40 (Kyshtym), 
storage practices were more reliable, employing steel vessels, 
yet even there something blew up in 1957 and released 20 MCi. It 
killed 20 km[.sup]2[/] of pine forest at once, and forests 
over 700 km[.sup]2[/] became sick. 
  Tomsk-7 ``excelled'' last spring. Then, a cry of despair was 
heard in July from the underground nuclear city in 
Krasnoyarsk-26: ``It may blow up with such a force that 
Chernobyl will look like a picnic!..'' 
  Burying radioactivity is a tricky business. The Americans 
are 
spending billions of dollars to build storage facilities, yet 
even there the scientists warned the U.S. President that the 
science was still not ready to guarantee the reliability of 
burial sites. 
  There is a debate in the West on whether mankind will 
survive 
until 2030. If it will not, who do you think will trigger the 
end? 
On Science and Applications 
  Let us look at the report from the ``UN Scientific Committee 
on the Effect of Atomic Radiation'' which incorporated data for 
1945-1984 (``Radiation: Doses, Effects, Risk.'' Moscow, 1990). 
  Virtually nothing is known about the effect of low radiation 
doses while available information is based either on linear 
extrapolation of large doses or the outcome of experiments on 
animals. Existing recording methods detect only significant 
disorders in the organism while small anomalies remain 
undetected although there are more of them, and their total 
contribution to the impairment of the organisms' functions may 
be even greater. 
Even proof is already available. 
  Nuclear power plant personnel irradiation and radon sources 
within the doses acceptable for operating personnel (5 rad/year) 
increase the number of chromosomal mutations. Little is known 
about the joint effect of radiation and chemical substances 
except perhaps tobacco smoke. The risk for a non-smoking uranium 
mine worker receiving a close-to-maximum permissible irradiation 
dose can be compared to the risk of a non-irradiated smoking 
worker. Yet the joint effect of smoking and irradiation does not 
double but quadruples mortality. In 1970, medical X-ray 
examinations in the United States took more lives than household 
injuries, fires, and poisonings together. 
  It seems like there is a bit more clarity with higher doses. 
A 300-500 rad dose results in a bone marrow injury, and half of 
the irradiated persons die. At 50-100 rad, some cells lose their 
ability to function normally but still regenerate. At 10 rad, 
temporary sterility is observed in men. The probability of dying 
from cancer under 100 rad increases by only 0.1-0.5%, 
while the 
number of serious genetic impairments in the sex cell ranges 
from zero to unity (it is higher among men). The probability 
that a disfigured child may be born to irradiated parents is 
low--0.2% per 100 rad. 
  Yet more recent studies show that cancer and genetic 
impairments appear even at doses which are one-to-two orders of 
magnitude lower than those according to the UN Scientific 
Committee data (Science No. 5002, 1991 and New 
Scientist No. 1871, 1993). 
What Has Chernobyl Shown? 
  Here are some data from the expert conclusion drawn by the 
"International Commonwealth on Restoring the Habitat and Safe 
Human Living Conditions" (Chernobylskaya Katastrofa (Chernobyl 
Catastrophe): Causes and Consequences, Minsk, 1992). In Belarus, 
thyroid gland cancer increased by sevenfold and cardiovascular 
diseases rose by 3.5-fold. In many regions of Gomel and Mogilov 
oblasts, chromosomal mutations increased by 1.5-2 times, the 
frequency of miscarriage and congenital diseases doubled, low 
birth weight jumped by fivefold, and ischemic heart disease 
increased by ninefold. Most schoolchildren have cardiovascular 
system disorders, and one-third of the population in these 
regions hase a weakened immune system. 
  Infant mortality and general population morbidity are 
continuing to rise, the intake of radionuclides into plants is 
not decreasing, and the physiological conditions of the animals 
are deteriorating despite the predictions of scientists from 
Biofizika and despite the measures taken in the aftermath of the 
accident. Social tensions are on the rise. Between 57 and 
90% 
of the respondents stated their categoric desire to relocate. 
The ratio of C-graders to A-graders in schools has increased by 
tenfold. The relocated persons are often met with hostility, as 
if they were lepers, and they run back to their contaminated 
places only to find new owners--refugees from the "near abroad." 
We still have a long way to go to match the Philippines or 
Indonesia where 80% of the population regard themselves as 
happy. 
  One cannot ascertain any pattern in the chaos of data. The 
favorite trick--to compare the polluted region to a clean 
one--does not work since contaminated food, water, and dust in 
the air know no boundaries. Cows in slightly contaminated 
territories (7 Ci/km[.sup]2[/] or approximately 7 rad per 
lifetime) give milk containing 20 times the maximum permissible 
concentration (PDK) of radionuclides. These territories are home 
to approximately 1 million persons. Given a 40 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/] contamination, milk contains 100 times the 
norm, yet shipments under state contracts continue from these 
territories. Drink our milk, my dear, and eat our beef... 
  According to some estimates based on Japanese analyses, the 
marginal cancer mortality due to Chernobyl will reach 70,000 
persons (A. Lyutsko). The Belarussians estimate the loss from 
the catastrophe as 60 annual budgets or 200 billion rubles. A 
modest accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 
the United States cost 135 billion dollars. Chernobyl has 
confronted the Belarussians with the problem of preserving their 
genetic stock. 
  At the same time, an amazing conclusion was drawn by the 
International Project on Chernobyl convened under the aegis of 
IAEA: there is no serious danger, so be fruitful and multiply. 
The IAEA press release is even more surprising: 100 experts from 
this agency admitted in an unofficial forum that there is no 
sufficient reason for their optimism. How shall we interpret 
this, gentlemen? What, indeed, are the reasons if the experts 
have predicted during the early weeks after the catastrophe that 
there would be water contamination, nuclide transport by winds, 
``hot'' dust particles (leading to tuberculosis), nuclide 
migration and presence in the soil, and joint effect of 
radiation and chemicals while forgetting about the immune system 
and genetic apparatus? 
  The IAEA has also approved the WHO concept of concentrating 
the efforts in individual population groups without spending 
them for wide-ranging, long-term research. What is this--penny 
pinching? Incompetence? Or maybe they are being overcome by 
curiosity? Were they finally given a unique opportunity--the 
whole country turned into a nuclear test site? In other words, 
let there be business as usual, and we will keep on looking... 
From Recording to Science 
  It soon will be 100 years since man has been irradiated with 
X-rays and radium and their effect studied. No unambiguous 
conclusions have been drawn thus far. The problem turned out to 
be a tough one. It is difficult to discern patterns among 
thousands of processes in the organism. What we have are 
recording of events, practical habits, and consequences. Yet 
there is no science, and no laws have been established. The 
emerging sciences of radiobiology and radioecology have not had 
the time to mature and bear fruit. 
  Western scientists are cautious: since we know little, let's 
stay close to the natural background of 7 rad per lifetime; the 
British prefer 3.5 rad while the ``British National Committee on 
Radiation Protection'' insists on 2 rad. 
  We do not like such standards. If these were in effect, we 
would be forced to relocate unknown dozens of millions of 
people. We have to choose another path: to raise the safe 
irradiation level. It will be worry-free, and all three branches 
of government will be happy. For us, the Biofizika Institute at 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Public Health has developed a 
standard of 35 rad per lifetime. Yet the foreigners are still 
praising us: yes, yes, they say. It is possible for you since 
you are ahead of the entire planet... Ahead. And running to get 
even further ahead. Give us our 100 rad per lifetime today (yes, 
there is such a proposal). Since the dogs are not dying, it will 
be fine for us too... 
What's Science up to? 
  The new science of radiobiology has recently stumbled across 
the central issue--the effect of low chronic radiation doses on 
the living organism, population, and the biosphere. Chronic 
irradiation may force the humans to depart from the biological 
arena or will generate a new breed of people--morons. Only 
active measures resting on fundamental knowledge have the power 
to resist this. The time when nature covered up for man's 
follies has passed, and today, he himself must save it. 
  Basic research began in the 1960s after the role of DNA 
became clear. Radiobiological studies proceeded according to the 
notion that small exposures resulted in small responses. Yet 
several years ago, Professors Ye. Burlakova and D. Spitkovskiy 
and Doctor of Biological Sciences L. Rozhdestvenskiy discovered 
some unexplained facts. It turned out that a 1-5 rad dose may be 
just as dangerous as 100 rad and even more dangerous than 10-30 
rad. These phenomena were identified in DNA and cell membrane 
lipids by Burlakova and in leukocyte chromosomes by Spitkovskiy. 
Changes occur in the bone marrow trunk cells which produce the 
blood and immune system components under the effect of low doses 
which either increase or decrease the cell's sensitivity to the 
damaging effect of large doses (Rozhdestvenskiy). 
  The earlier-observed effects of low doses clouded by the 
dogma of their low significance have not caused alarm. The 
discovery of the nonlinear character of the radiation's effect 
on living entities demolished this dogma and are in the phase of 
modern scientific paradigm of the behavior of self-organizing 
systems, such as living organisms. Yet the new observations also 
contradict traditional physics and chemistry. One rad is 
3[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-9[/] M/l, or 
2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]15[/] corrosive molecule fragments 
which rain upon the complex and fine mechanism of cell and 
intercellular processes. One rad is the small 
fluctuation which, near the critical state, may lead to a 
catastrophe--the breakup of the organism. One rad is 20 annual 
backgrounds. Yet in addition to radiation, there are pesticides, 
acid rain, heavy metals, and ultraviolet irradiation through the 
ozone holes... And all this is compounded and often multiplied. 
  This means that the problem must be examined and developed 
and research must be expanded. And this needs money. 
  The Chairman of the Scientific Council on Radiobiology at 
Russia's Academy of Sciences Yelena Borisovna Burlakova and 
Professor N.N. Semenova, chief of the Chemical-Physical 
Institute Department at Russia's Academy of Sciences visited the 
Vice President of Russia's Academy of Sciences and Deputy 
Minister for Science (who, by the way, is a corresponding member 
of Russia's Academy of Sciences and an expert in this field) at 
the Environmental Protection and National Resources Ministry and 
at the State Chernobyl Committee. 
  The professors were received splendidly everywhere they 
went, 
and the results of her and her colleagues' studies were praised 
highly, and deep understanding of the importance of the problem 
was expressed, after which they were footballed to the next 
department due to the shortage of funds... When the State 
Chernobyl Committee sent her back to the Academy of Sciences, 
the circle became closed. You guessed it right: no one gave her 
the money. 
Where to Get Money? 
  The Soviet man is accustomed to ``receiving'' money from the 
bureaucrat. A good Soviet bureaucrat knew perfectly well to whom 
``to give'' and for what. If a Politburo member had a pain in 
the eye all of a sudden, three laboratories were set up 
immediately. If the member was satisfied, the bureaucrat's 
bosses were happy and the bureaucrat was happy too. If the 
member died, all three laboratories were fired. And everybody 
was again unhappy. 
  And what is the advantage or satisfaction from radiobiology? 
Is there danger or threat to health without it? 
  Well, it is not quite like that. We do have a special 
agriculture industry, special food and water purified in order 
to remove from any kind of poison, and special environmental 
condition monitoring. We also have special children who will 
grow up, and we will make sure that they, in turn, do not give 
birth to monsters, and should the worst happen, we will park 
them abroad... 
  The biologists are asking for money to save academic 
radiobiology. In translation, this means to save us and our 
children, not the chosen ones. Yet they have to ask it from the 
same bureaucrat and oftentimes, from the same person. And 
naturally, with the same outcome. 
  The conclusion is self-evident.

<F P=106> [Speech by President of the Russian Academy of Medical </F>
Sciences V.I. Pokrovskiy at the Second (LXV) Session of the 
General Meeting of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, 
26-30 January 1993: ``The Report of President of the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences V.I. Pokrovskiy''] 
  [Text] The scientific portion of this session is devoted to 
the neurosciences.[.sup]1[/] This is connected with the fact 
that an increase of the number of people suffering from nervous 
and mental illnesses, the outcome of which in half of the cases 
is disability, is being noted throughout the world. 
  This is not only the loss of manpower resources, but also a 
loss of the intellectual potential of the nation, as well as one 
of the causes of serious social deformations. Diseases of the 
brain are usually accompanied by disturbances of thinking, 
behavior, and the emotional sphere, of which an increase of drug 
addiction, crime, and suicides is a direct consequence. 
  In Russia not less than 20 million people suffer from 
diseases that to one degree or another are connected with brain 
disorders. About 5 million people are chronically disabled owing 
to these illnesses. The maintenance of patients costs 
approximately 23 billion rubles [R] a year. 
  The scale of the total losses of society in connection with 
pathology of the nervous system is unprecedented. They are 
estimated, for example, in the United States alone at $401 
billion a year, which amounts to an economic value that is equal 
to 7.3 percent of the gross national product. Of course, the 
noneconomic harm is extremely great, but it is not liable to 
scientific determination. 
  It should also be considered that the process of the 
increase 
of the length of the biological life of man is not being 
accompanied, unfortunately, by the lengthening of the period of 
his labor activity. On the contrary, it is making him 
unprotected against nervous system diseases of old age and in 
need of the help of others. Nervous and mental disorders, 
particularly psychoemotional stress, are the favorite place of 
the application of the activity of charlatans of all 
colors--sorcerers, psychics, and miracle workers. This also 
merits the more active attention of specialists. 
  The World Health Organization and the leadership of a number 
of countries have made at the state level the decision on a 
10-year program on the study of the brain--``The Decade of the 
Brain, 1990-2000''. In the United States this program has 
acquired the status of a law, which has been passed by Congress 
with its annual financing in the amount of more than $350 
million a year. Similar decisions are being made in the 
countries of the European Community. 
  The development of the neurosciences in our country and in 
the world confirms the possibility of obtaining in a 
comparatively short time results that can actually change the 
negative situation in the country, which is due to the medical 
and socioeconomic consequences of brain diseases of man. In 
connection with this the problems of the neurosciences should be 
grouped with priority problems. 
  It should be recalled that earlier the AMS [Academy of 
Medical Sciences] also discussed repeatedly the problems of the 
central nervous system and the brain. In particular, the sixth 
session (1950), which was held jointly with the USSR Academy of 
Sciences, was devoted to the development of the teachings of 
I.P. Pavlov. At the seventh session (1952) the first results 
were supplied (the theme--all diseases are due to a cortical 
disorder). The ninth session (1955) was the physiological 
analysis of the problem of inhibition. The 24th session (1967) 
was devoted to questions of the disturbance of cerebral 
circulation. The 32d session (1972) discussed the problem ``The 
Physiology and Pathology of the Brain.'' 
  At this session, which encompasses a wide range of 
questions, 
we need to approve the scientific program ``The Human Brain.'' 
We hope that this will be the first academic program that is 
supported by state financing, on which there is preliminary 
agreement. 
  The Presidium of the RAMS [Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences] also made the decision to conclude the scientific part 
of the sessions henceforth not with decrees, but with the 
adoption of scientific programs, the financing of the themes and 
projects of which will be carried out on a competitive (grant) 
basis. 
  Experience has shown that the formulation of state programs 
with special-purpose budget financing and their implementation 
on the basis of an expert evaluation and competitive selection 
during the period of an acute financial shortage are the most 
advanced form of the planning, coordination, and support of the 
most promising scientific research and collectives of 
scientists. The programs make it possible to consolidate the 
efforts of researchers, to set up temporary collectives, to halt 
in good time the financing of unpromising ones and, on the 
contrary, to strengthen promising ones. 
  Goal program financing is a tool, by means of which the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences can accomplish its main 
task--to raise to a qualitatively new level basic and applied 
research in medicine, the results of which will make a 
substantial change in the notion of the processes of vital 
activity of the healthy and ill person or will cause the radical 
improvement of the methods of diagnosis and treatment. 
  Under present conditions medical science, just as the entire 
domestic health care system, is close to crisis. The 
preservation of the Academy of Medical Sciences, its structure, 
and the scientific potential is a great achievement. However, 
thus far there is no concept of state policy of the development 
of medical science in the country, since the judicial legal 
status of scientific research and other institutions and of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences itself has not been 
determined. The phrase from the Edict of the President of the 
Russian Federation that the functions on the organization and 
coordination of medical science in the country have been 
assigned to the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, is well 
known. But by other Edicts similar functions have been assigned 
to other ministries and departments, and this phrase remains a 
phrase, since legal and financial ties of the scientific 
councils of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences with higher 
educational institutions and scientific research institutions of 
the Ministry of Health and the State Committee of Sanitary 
Epidemiological Supervision of the Russian Federation and of 
other departmental affiliation are lacking. Owing to this the 
indicated institutions do not submit to the scientific councils 
and problem commissions plans and reports of scientific research 
work. Each department is introducing its own planning and 
reporting cards, which often are incompatible with each other. 
  Now 62 state programs, which concern the protection of the 
health of the population and medical science and were submitted 
by 12 ministries and departments, are now under consideration 
for financing in the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. 
The Ministry of Health of Russia has drawn up another 38 
sectorial programs, moreover, all the programs are financed from 
the state budget, bypassing the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences. There are also various foundations. In the formed 
situation it is obvious that the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences is unable to perform the functions assigned to it by 
the President of Russia on the planning and coordination of 
medical science in the country, to conduct a qualified 
examination of scientific research projects, and to plan the 
further development of health care. 
  Taking what has been said into account, since August 1992 a 
commission, which was set up by the Presidium of the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences, under the chairmanship of 
Academician of the RAMS V.D. Fedorov has been working on the 
preparation of the Law on the development of medical science and 
the place of our academy. The commission has been working 
together with the Committee for Health of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Russian Federation and at present has prepared documents for 
the holding of parliamentary readings, which will take place in 
February 1993. 
  The necessity of the Law is determined by a number of 
circumstances, among which the most important one is the 
determination of the place of the academy and its institutions 
in the system of the distribution of the forms of property 
(state, municipal, and private) in accordance with the Law on 
Property, which was passed after the Edict of the President of 4 
January 1992 on the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. 
  In the Law the landed ownership of other types of property 
should also been attached to the academy and its institutions, 
since the lack of the same considerably complicates the activity 
of scientific collectives. 
  Further, it is necessary to legalize what was incorporated 
in 
the decree of the Government of July 1992 and, unfortunately, 
has thus far not been fulfilled--the determination of the level 
of financing of the academy and the social support of scientific 
associates of the academy and the assignment to the academy of 
the expert evaluation of scientific plans and the distribution 
of assets through grants. 
  In spite of the existing difficulties, scientists of Russia 
continued to conduct scientific research intensively. 
  Among the achievements of world level are the isolation of 
clones of hybridoma cells, which secrete monoclonal antibodies 
to the antigens of B cells of the pancreas, and the development 
of methods of the early diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes. 
Various immunomodulators were developed and were partially 
introduced in practice. Sparing methods of the treatment of 
intricate disturbances of the heart rhythm, techniques of 
transluminal angioplasty, and methods of the combined therapy of 
lymphogranulomatosis, which ensure a five-year survival rate of 
70-92 percent, were developed. New neurotropic and psychotropic 
drugs, heart remedies, and others were developed, tested, and 
introduced in practice. 
  Original X-ray endovascular methods of the replacement of 
blood vessels, sclera-strengthening methods for the prevention 
of the progression of myopias, and equipment and instruments for 
microsurgical operations, traumatology, and orthopedics, which 
have received world recognition, were developed. The Urat-2 
device for the intrarenal crushing of stones was developed. 
  Scientists of the Siberian Department developed methods of 
monitoring the health of the population and the environment and 
conducted depth epidemiological studies of the most prevalent 
noninfectious diseases. This made it possible to carry out the 
medical demographic, public health, and ecological mapping of a 
number of territories of Siberia and the Far East. 
  A collection of molecular probes of synthetic 
oligonucleotides, which is making it possible to study the 
structure of human DNA, were created. 
  The universal phenomenon of regenerator-plastic 
insufficiency 
and the decrease of metabolism was established, which makes it 
possible to reveal one of the mechanisms of the adaptation of 
the body under present adverse ecological conditions and creates 
the foundation for the development of fundamentally new 
approaches to prevention and therapy. New drugs were obtained 
from local resources. 
  It is possible to continue this list. But now is not the 
time 
to talk about successes. It is more important to find means of 
escaping a number of extremely negative trends that have 
occurred. 
  The main one of them is the decreasing amount of financing. 
  At the end of 1992 the amount of financing of scientific 
research of the academy came to R1.7 billion. As compared with 
1991 financing has increased by 8.7-fold, moreover, 24.3 percent 
of these assets (R428 million) were transferred to the academy 
only on 25 December 1992. The amount of financing of clinics 
came to R3,001,000,000. Allocations for the acquisition of 
equipment and the capital repair of the buildings of clinics 
were envisaged in the indicated sum, but 27 percent of the 
year's assets were also transferred to the academy after 20 
December. 
  How was it possible in a week to spend these assets 
purposefully? 
  And as a whole the increase of the amount of financing by 
the 
sections ``Science'' and ``Clinic'' does not offset the level of 
material expenditures of municipal services, which has increased 
by 15- to 30-fold, and at clinics the level of the cost of 
foodstuffs and medicines, which has increased by 50- to 100-fold. 
  Institutions and organizations have cut sharply the purchase 
of equipment and current outlays on scientific work and are not 
buying laboratory animals from nurseries, which has led 
nurseries to the decrease of production volumes, as a result of 
which their financial position is in a critical state. 
  The buildings of institutes are falling to the ground, since 
there are no assets for the performance of capital repair, for 
preparation for operation under winter conditions, and for their 
maintenance in proper condition. 
  An extremely serious situation has formed at the clinics of 
scientific research institutions. 
  The financial difficulties are being accompanied by the lack 
of the necessary drugs, instruments, equipment, and so on. A 
significant amount of imported equipment is idle, since there 
are no spare parts for it and no reagents. Freely convertible 
currency has not been allotted to the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences for two years. 
  On 15 January 1993 there were no control figures with 
respect 
to the budget for 1993 at the academy. It is unknown whether 
funds will be allocated for the introduction as of 1 December 
1992 of new salaries in accordance with the unified wage scale. 
  Financing for January has been opened in the amount of 
one-third of the credits of the fourth quarter of 1992. 
  It is natural that the financial crisis is adversely 
affecting the state of medical science. The attempts at the 
commercialization of medical science and the conversion of 
scientific research institutions to full self-support and 
self-financing are intensifying. The mass departure of 
scientific associates, moreover, the best trained ones, for work 
abroad under long-term contracts is being noted. Here a third of 
the scientific institutions of the RAMS have completely rejected 
international cooperation, the others have drastically 
restricted its volume. 
  The reason consists in the lack of assets for the 
fulfillment 
of the obligations of the Russian side within the framework of 
the signed agreements, and first of all with respect to the 
receiving of foreign specialists and the sending abroad of 
scientists of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. 
  Attempts to establish parallel structures or structures that 
replace the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (State 
Scientific Centers, which are directly subordinate to the 
Ministry of Science, the Higher School, and Technical Policy of 
the Russian Federation, the National Institute of Health, and so 
forth), having taken away the rights and functions of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, are being observed all the 
time. Is it worthwhile, perhaps, to hear alternative proposals 
at the General Meeting of the academy, especially as they are 
being put forward or are supported by individual members of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences? 
  Of course, the activity of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences and its presidium deserves criticism. It is reacting 
slowly to the changed political and economic situation in the 
country. 
  We have not formulated a scientifically substantiated 
concept 
of the protection of the health of the population and the 
development of health care under the new economic conditions. We 
have not achieved, in spite of intensified work, the fulfillment 
of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation and the 
decree of the Government, which concern medical science. We are 
carrying out slowly, although in a number of cases this has 
proved to be a positive factor, the reorganization of the 
activity of the academy itself. 
  However, it has been possible to do something. Today the 
session is settling the question of the establishment of the 
Northwestern Department of the RAMS, the structure of which will 
be absolutely new for the academy. Higher educational 
institutions and scientific research institutions, which are not 
included at the administrative level among the institutions of 
the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and are not financed by 
it, will be a part of the department on a functional basis. 
Given the break of vertical ties in the country and the 
strengthening of the economic independence of administrative 
territories the regional principle of the activity of the 
academy is acquiring particular interest, although many 
organizational and economic questions thus far remain unclear 
and inadequately studied. 
  The question of establishing the Volga River Center is being 
raised. 
  The Kursk Medical Institute in the person of its 
rector--Prof. A.V. Zavyalov--advanced the interesting initiative 
of establishing a Central Chernozem cost accounting affiliate of 
the RAMS. 
  Two institutes, which have a large turnover and are 
operating 
entirely on a cost accounting basis, became a part of the 
academy. 
  The Medical Literature Association, of which the Meditsina 
Publishing House, the Meditsinskaya entsiklopediya Scientific 
Production Association, and the publishing division of the 
Moscow Medical Academy imeni Sechenov became a part, was formed. 
There are grounds to hope that the systematic publication of 
medical journals will be resumed. Manuals and textbooks have 
again begun to appear. Work has started on the fourth edition of 
Bolshaya meditsinskaya entsiklopediya (The Great Medical 
Encyclopedia). 
  Several changes of the structure have also been carried out 
in the staff of the Presidium of the academy. A legal division, 
an economic administration, and a consular group in the 
Administration of Foreign Relations have been established. The 
structure in the administration of affairs has been streamlined, 
and several other things. 
  The level of medical science is the level of health care, 
this is the future health of the people. Today the academy is 
experiencing not the best of times, but nevertheless it is 
developing. 
  The academy in essence is beginning a new cycle of its 
development and activity. And our task is not only to preserve 
the scientific potential of medical science of the country, but 
also to enrich the traditions of domestic medicine, which is 
strong first of all in its scientific schools. And if step by 
step we achieve successes, this will help make the future of 
Russia brighter than it appears today.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Prochorov, Director of the Institute </F>
of General Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences: ``The 
Plight of Science''; first paragraph DELOVIE LYUDI comment] 
  [Text] The Nobel Prize winner and one of the creators of 
the laser, Alexander Prochorov, claims that Russia is joining 
the ranks of the third-grade science power and unless the 
government's attitude to science does not alter, the process 
will be irreversible. 
  The golden years of Russian science were the end of the 
1940's and the beginning of the 1950's. Salaries, provisions and 
equipment were all of the very best quality. In retrospect, this 
had its good and bad aspects, but the fact remains that 
scientists were well looked after. The results were positive: 
for years the world has been using a particle accelerator which 
was designed and made by Soviet scientists during those glorious 
years. It was at that time too that work began on developing the 
laser principle of producing high-intensity radiation, for which 
the author of this article, together with Nikolai Basov and the 
American Charles H. Townes, was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
physics. In those years research began into space and astounding 
progress was made. The list of examples goes on. Western 
scientists who are aware of the collapse of Russian science are 
tempted to ask, ``How is it then that the Soviet Union managed 
to break ahead?'' American colleagues remark how the successes 
of the USSR influenced the policies of the U.S. Congress and 
administration on basic science and scientists in that country. 
  In Russia, the situation has deteriorated, a process which 
began under Nikita Khrushchev. The policy of ``uniting science 
and practice'' was carried out ruthlessly. Whole institutes 
which carried out academic research were handed over to 
industry, including the Institute of Computing and Mathematics, 
the Institute of Oceanology and others. Fundamental research was 
placed on the back burner. The result in a number of important 
branches of science was lamentable. Specialists attracted by the 
``introduction into industry'' abandoned a number of ideas in 
the field of microelectronics. No attention was paid to the idea 
of ultra-pure materials or to high-quality diagnostic equipment. 
As a result, the computer Pamyat, which was way behind those 
being made abroad, was developed. Now, Russia is so 
``successful'' that her scientists wonder whether they will ever 
catch up with the Americans and the Japanese. 
  It is true that even in bad times there have been people in 
government who have well understood the importance of basic 
science. Many significant developments were made under the 
patronage of the military, but secrecy problems arose. As a 
scientist, it was clear to me that without exchanging 
information it would be impossible for science to move forward. 
I managed to stop many feeble attempts to make research work at 
the Institute of General Physics secret. It is curious to 
remember the complaint of one Russian who bemoaned the fact that 
he, who had the power to classify any of a scientist's projects 
as "top secret" and forbid him to travel abroad, was unable to 
classify his thoughts. 
<H5>  CATCH 22 </H5>
  The deterioration which is taking place in Russian science 
has already caused the country to be relegated to the third 
world, and in five years this process will be irreversible. 
Within the Academy of Sciences, a fall in scientific and labour 
discipline has become commonplace, as has the desertion of 
scientists for other spheres and the attempt to move abroad at 
all costs. The Presidium of the Academy has increased the 
salaries of scientists, but mostly this remains true only on 
paper, as the government cannot fund it. A stratum of 
self-styled ``pensioners'' has already formed amongst 
scientists. These scientists appear at their institutes mainly 
on the days when their allowances are paid (they cannot be 
called salaries), while in the rest of their time these 
candidates and doctors of science earn extra money by building 
dachas for businessmen, quietly growing crops on 
their plots of land, or turning to business. Of course, a number 
of institutes, including the Institute of General Physics, 
retain their former glory: the group of those devoted to science 
remains intact; foreigners come, offering contracts and joint 
projects. However, the West sees Russian scientists as cheap 
labour. Leading Russian scientists are being offered salaries on 
a par with those in Malaysia or Mexico. Proposals have been made 
to buy out laboratories or even whole institutes and, naturally, 
to dictate the research programme. 
  Russian science has been forced to sell its most important 
files, expensive equipment and materials, and designs which are 
the last word in scientific thought and which any other country 
would not sell at any price. In saying this, I do not wish to 
give the impression that I am against partnership or cooperation 
with foreign scientists. I myself was born in Australia, and 
have lived abroad and enjoyed the hospitality of foreign 
scientists. The Institute of General Physics is working on a 
number of joint projects, including with the U.S., South Korea 
and France. Yet the sale of scientific developments and 
strategic supplies in the hope of saving what little remains 
signals the beginning of a collapse. 
  However, even these necessary sales cost the Institute 
dearly. It is told, ``You earn hard currency, therefore you must 
be a commercial organization, and references to your research do 
not give you the right to request a discount on electricity, 
water or materials,'' which are needed in great quantities for 
carrying out the work. Incidentally, references to our research, 
or to the need to keep up scientific funding are not even heeded 
at government level. Several appeals on the part of scientists, 
including the president of the Academy of Sciences, to both the 
Gaidar and the Chernomyrdin governments, had no success. The 
matter is usually dealt with by petty clerks who take care to 
remind representatives of institutes that there are many mouths 
to feed. 
  Although the current powers include, as never before, many 
people with scientific degrees--there are even correspondent 
members and academicians--such an attitude reflects the lack of 
understanding regarding the scope of basic science which, given 
the chance, could make breakthroughs in high technology. Even in 
former times, advanced, promising ideas were not always taken on 
board. At the time when laser technology was being developed, a 
director of industry had to be invited to the Institute to 
attend seminars describing the future for laser technology. At 
least then scientists were trusted, but now the lack of 
understanding is deepening, as is the economic crisis. 
<H5>  RICH MAN, POOR MAN </H5>
  In this situation, all that remains to do is to fold one's 
arms and wish success to those who find a work placement abroad 
and sign a long-term contract. What else can one do, if the 
average salary at a scientific institute is 25,000 rubles (25 
dollars at the beginning of September). How can these people and 
their families survive in comparison, newspapers advertise jobs 
for painters with a salary of R150,000. Comments to the effect 
that science must be reorganized and freed from its excess 
weight are disturbing. What is needed is a normal level of 
financing, the provision of equipment and materials, and of 
course, control over the results. 
  The fact that Russian science is lagging behind is growing 
more noticeable by the day, and, what is more, the advance of 
scientific knowledge in the rest of the world is accelerating. 
It is cause for concern that Russian scientists have nothing to 
report to world conferences on technology. Russia might once 
again miss the boat, for instance in nanotechnology, where 
scientists are working on the level of atomic structures. A new 
era of laser technology is about to begin, and here Russia is 
behind: there is no money available to finance this work, and 
nothing, as is known, will come of nothing. One cannot even 
order foreign science magazines--there is no hard currency. At 
the Institute of General Physics work has been stopped on 
crystal growth. The effect this will have on microelectronics is 
clear: all materials will have to be imported. Indeed, even 
Russia's own manufacturers are driving her towards this. For 
example, zirconium oxide, which is used in the manufacture of 
fianite currently costs so much that it is cheaper to buy it 
abroad. Yet due to the shortage of hard currency, work in this 
field will also have to cease. Financing in the field of 
fiber-optic communications, laser physics, solid-state physics 
and optics, where Russian institutes have high-class designs 
attracting the interest of foreign countries, is nowhere near 
sufficient. Thanks to a number of contracts with foreign firms, 
some of them are still managing to get by. 
  If developments are not made in the field of fiber-optic 
technology, the country as a whole will be unable to make any 
progress. People wrongly believe that cellular communications 
are an alternative, but one of the disadvantages of such systems 
is the ease with which conversations can be overheard. With 
fiber-optic systems, however, it is impossible to listen in on 
conversations: i.e., not only military, but any commercial 
secrets will be better protected. I believe that Russia has all 
that is necessary to create a fiber-optic network herself. 
  Russia is a country rich in talent and ideas, but most of 
all 
it must be hoped that she does not destruct science herself. It 
can be saved today, but tomorrow will be too late.

Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and 
Botanical Garden of Moscow State University imeni M. V. 
Lomonosov, Moscow: ``Soros Foundation Grants for the Problem of 
`Biological Diversity'''; UDC 58:061.21:06.026.53] 
  [Text] The funding of research through a system of grants 
offered on a competitive basis by different foundations is a 
common practice in the West. At the present time, this form of 
funding is also coming to our country but, unfortunately, this 
is happening in the presence of progressive "cuts" in State 
allocations. Thus far, George Soros, the well-known American 
financier and public figure, originally from Hungary, has made 
some real steps to support Russian science. Recently, the 
endeavors of Soros have been aired extensively in the Russian 
press. 
  One of the first Soros project in Russia and other CIS 
states 
was to provide a rather considerable sum to support research on 
biological diversity. Announcements of the competition for 
grants, which was established by the International Cultural 
Initiative Foundation and Russian Federation Academy of Natural 
Sciences [RANS], appeared in the press in June and July 1992. N. 
N. Vorontsov, RANS vice-president, was the initiator. 
  The competition was announced for the following directions 
of 
the Biodiversity problem: 
  1) systematics of plants (including fungi and 
microorganisms) 
and preservation of their biodiversity; 
  2) systematics of animals and preservation of their 
biodiversity; 
  3) paleosystematics and evolution of biodiversity; 
  4) genetic methods of studying and preserving biodiversity; 
  5) methods of preserving collections on biodiversity; the 
museum and collection business; 
  6) study and preservation of biodiversity in sanctuaries. 
  G. Soros allocated slightly less than a million dollars to 
the competition, planning to distribute this sum among close to 
4,000 grantees in republics of the former USSR (with the 
exception of the Baltic states, Ukraine and Moldova, where there 
are branches of the Soros Foundation). 
  It is known that something similar to grants has appeared in 
recent times in our research institutions as a sort of 
supplement to basic funding, but retention of dominance of 
administrative-feudal relations leads, not infrequently, to even 
greater flaws in distribution of funds that with the direct 
payment system. To avoid this, the Cultural Initiative 
Foundation selected the form of individual applications to 
participate in the competition without passing through any 
administrative entities. Two expert commissions, for Moscow and 
St. Petersburg, were created to hold the contest. The Moscow 
commission, headed by N. N. Vorontsov, consists of botanists V. 
A. Krasilov, M. G. Pimenov, A. K. Skvortsov, and V. N. 
Tikhomirov; the St. Petersburg commission, headed by Yu. I. 
Polyanskiy, comprises botanists M. A. Bondartseva, D. V. 
Geltman, N. S. Golubkova, S. G. Zhilin, R. V. Kamelin, N. N. 
Tsvelev, and B. A. Yurtsev. The expert commissions considered 
the following factors: consistency of topic in the submitted 
application and personal experience of the applicant with the 
orientation of the competition, potential benefit of announced 
research and, when screening applications according to Item 5, 
importance and general availability of the preserved 
collections. The Moscow applicants were examined by the St. 
Petersburg commission and the restby the Moscow commission, and 
each application was examined by at least three experts. 
  A total of 2,252 applications were received, and 2,110 
passed 
the competition. Most of the accepted applications came from 
Russia (1,885), 72 were from Armenia, 34 from Kazakhstan, 27 
from Belorussia, 26 from Georgia, 18 from Kyrgyzia, 13 from 
Turkmenia, 11 each from Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, and 9 from 
Tajikistan. Botanical applications constituted about one-fourth 
of the total number (537 + 137 applications, which could be 
considered botanical), and there was approximately the same 
share among those accepted with regard to distribution in 
different states. Most of the applications submitted by 
botanists were received from the Botanical Institute imeni 
Komarov, RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] (186), Moscow State 
University] (47), State Botanical Garden RAN (26), Institute of 
Plant Growing imeni N. I. Vavilov (12) and from other cities 
(Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Penza, 
Tver, Ashkhabad, and others). The grants (each for $250) were 
paid out in a lump sum (once); payments began in March 1993. 
  In compiling this information, we used data kindly provided 
by A. P. Rasnitsyn, who performed the duties of commission 
chairman during a temporary absence of N. N. Vorontsov.

<F P=106> [Article ``Chemical weapons or chemical war?'' by V. </F>
Voronov, L. Fedorov under the rubric ``Current Topics''] 
  [Text] Two significant events occurred in the world of 
chemical disarmament in the second decade of January 1993. On 13 
January in Paris, Russia signed the Convention on banning the 
development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical 
weapons and its destruction and together with her, more than 100 
other countries affixed their signatures. At a joint meeting of 
the Committee on Industry and Power and the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources at the Russian Federation 
Supreme Council in Moscow on 19 January, the committees rejected 
the very concept of the comprehensive program of stage-by-stage 
destruction of chemical weapons in Russia submitted by the 
Convention Committee on Chemical and Biological Weapons. Almost 
no one objects to the fact that chemical weapons must be 
destroyed. Yet such a seemingly noble 
cause--disarmament--engenders numerous problems which are not 
only economic but also environmental, social, and political in 
nature. In itself, parting with chemical weapons does not 
signify an end to chemical war but merely its transition to a 
new--environmental--phase. The experience of our civilization 
reveals that it is not easy to untangle the knot of 
contradictions without a detailed study of history. 
Consequently, we asked two professionals in their respective 
fields, the historian Vladimir Voronov who recently completed 
graduate studies at Russia's Humanities Academy and Doctor of 
Chemical Sciences Lev Fedorov to talk about the development of 
chemical weapons production in our country. The facts which they 
are presenting here are drawn from declassified archives, 
official statements, and private conversations with people in 
the know. This is how the conversation turned out. 
  Chemist. From the chemical viewpoint, the most 
``prolific'' part of our chemical weapons in the last 70 years 
can be divided into four categories--yperites [mustard gases], 
choking chemical warfare (OV) agents (phosgene and diphosgene), 
arsenic-containing chemical warfare agents (lewisite, adamsite, 
and diphenylchlorarsine), and finally, highly toxic 
phosphorus-containing nerve agents (sarin, soman, and V-gas). 
Production of the first three groups falls within the period 
from the 1920s to the late 1950s. The last category is the 
``accomplishment'' of the 1960s-1980s. In particular, mustard 
gases formed the bulk of our chemical arsenal up to the 1950s 
while everything began back in the 1920s. 
  Mustard Gases 
  Historian. The first mustard gas batch was 
produced in Moscow by the Olginskiy plant which was nominally 
listed as experimental production of the Anilintrest. This 
happened between 30 Aug and 3 Sep 24. Eighteen pounds of the 
products were produced. It is interesting to note the way this 
formulation was described in those years: production of one 
pound of the substance "H" called for 2,006 buckets of 95% 
alcohol, 0.9 pounds of technical sulfur chloride, and 10 pounds 
of commercial sulfuric acid. 
  Chemist. Substance ``H'' is the code name of 
technical mustard gas which can be produced by the simplest 
technology through ethylene. It usually contains a lot of 
impurities--from 20 to 50% (distilled mustard gas is 
referred 
to as HD). Cloaked in this manner of clothing, mustard gas can 
be traced through all of our prior documents. Yet in the 
chemical language, this formulation appears rather prosaic: 



  The need for alcohol was probably overstated because of the 
need for the traditional ``washing of optical axes.'' And the 
first ``smelting'' was produced at today's GSNIIOKhT (Institute 
of Organic Chemistry and Engineering in Moscow) which for a long 
time has specialized in developing chemical weapons. It was set 
up back in 1922, and the Olginskiy plant was under its 
jurisdiction as an experimental enterprise. 
  The purpose of combat employment of mustard gas--a 
persistent 
blister agent--was to contaminate the ``enemy'' terrain. Before 
World War II, this ``king of gases'' took a leading position in 
the arsenals of Germany, the United States, and the USSR. Yet 
other types of mustard gases also existed--nitrogen and oxygen 
mustard gases, sesquiyperite, etc. Each of these had its own 
history on our Earth. 



  Our military was experimenting with special enthusiasm with 
low freezing and viscous formulations. 
  Historian. By the way, our military learned to use 
mustard gas in 1927-1933 under the leadership of German military 
chemists. This enabled the teachers to conceal their work with 
chemical warfare agents banned under the Treaty of Versailles in 
the USSR. The first serious German-Soviet mustard gas tests were 
conducted at the edge of today's central chemical warfare 
testing range in Shikhany (Saratov oblast). The first attempt to 
set up production of mustard gas in the town of Ivashchenkovo 
(subsequently Trotsk which is now called Chapayevsk in Samara 
oblast) in 1923-1926 also involved the Germans. Yet it was 
unsuccessful, so large-scale technical mustard gas production 
began only in the 1930s in Chepayevsk at the Bersol plant (now 
the chemical fertilizer plant). Generally speaking, mustard gas 
was produced at two new chemical construction projects--the 
giants of the first five-year plan. In 1929--at the Berezniki 
Chemical Works (soda plant in Perm oblast), the other giant is 
the chemical works in Bobriki (subsequently Stalinogorsk in 
Moscow oblast and today--Novomoskovsk in Tula oblast). Its 
design mustard gas capacity is 9,000 t/yr. Here we should add 
production of viscous yperite with a capacity of 6,000 t. Other 
yperite producers at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s which can 
be mentioned include the Bogorodskiy and Ugreshskiy plants (both 
in Moscow) as well as others. By 1935, the production capacity 
of our mustard gas facilities reached 35,000 t. This was without 
the Chapayevsk plant and high-volume production of 
ethylene-propylene low-freezing mustard gas according to V.S. 
Zaykov's technology set up just before the war at Kaprolaktam 
(Dzerzhinsk) which, it seems, lasted longer than the rest. 
  Choking Agents 
  Chemist. In closing the ``mustard gas'' page in 
our history, we must add that during the war, attempts to 
produce mustard gas in Russia alone were made at 30 plants, 
including plants in Omsk and Tomsk where mustard gas facilities 
were constructed with U.S. assistance. Yet technical yperite "H" 
is a relatively simple product while some of our plants had a 
rather broad chemical warfare orientation. For example, the 
Chapayevsk and Novomoskovsk plants also produced choking 
agents--phosgene and diphosgene--in addition to mustard gas: 



  These chemical warfare agents were used during World War I. 
Both, especially phosgene, occupied an important place in our 
war plans. Today, phosgene is not as much a chemical warfare 
agent as a semifinished product necessary for the chemical 
industry. According to the terminology adopted by the Chemical 
Disarmament Convention, phosgene is a dual-use chemical. Yet 
during those years, everything was different. By the way, even 
today, the Army possesses a small phosgene arsenal of 50 t in 
the form of munitions. 
  Historian. In the 1930s, everything indeed was 
different. In 1935, our industry produced 13,000 t of phosgene 
annually (the principal producers were the Chernaya Rechka 
chemical plant imeni M.I. Kalinin, Rubezhansk Chemical Works, 
and Chapayevsk plant). And all these tons acquired not a 
chemical but military life. The diphosgene production capacity 
at that time was 1.9 thousand t while the Army demanded all of 
five. During the war, production of chemical warfare agents rose 
sharply. 
  Arsenic-Containing Chemical Warfare Agents 
  Chemist. Let us examine one blistering chemical 
warfare agent--_b_-chlorovinyldichlorarsine which is better 
known as lewisite (by the name of its developer G.N. Lewis). In 
contrast to mustard gas, this chemical warfare agent does not 
have a latent period (which for mustard gas reaches several 
days). 
  Strictly speaking, combat lewisite contains several 
substances since it is produced by adding AsCl[.sup]3[/] to 
acetylene in the presence of catalytic quantities of 
AlCl[.sup]3[/], HgCl[.sub]2[/], and CuCl[.sub]2[/]: 



  Yet only trace amounts of arsenic trichloride and 
_g_-lewisite are contained in the mixture while the 
_b_-lewisite 
concentration may reach 10%. Thus, the combat origin of 
lewisite is formed by _a_-lewisite which develops during the 
synthesis in the form of two isomers: 



  The most toxic trans-isomer is predominant in the mixture. 
  Historian. The history of lewisite in the USSR was 
thornier than that of other chemical warfare agents. In 1935, 
the Army announced an annual need for 1,000 t of lewisite but 
did not receive a single ton from the industry. The need to 
obtain lewisite was repeatedly reflected in government decrees. 
In 1937, the chief of the Chemical Warfare Directorate of the 
workers' and peasants' Red Army complained in a memorandum to I. 
Stalin and V. Molotov that the Berezniki Chemical Works still 
had not set up planned lewisite production. 
  Chemist. The reason isquite simple--there was no 
calcium carbide without which cheap acetylene cannot be produced: 



  In Central Russia, calcium carbide production was set up 
just 
before the war at the Chernaya Rechka plant (Dzerzhinsk). This 
was what gave an impetus to lewisite production at the 
Kaprolaktam (Dzerzhinsk) and in Chapayevsk. By the way, a third 
kiln was added in 1943 to the two operating furnaces. 
Altogether, attempts were made to engage at least 13 plants in 
lewisite production in Russia alone. 
  Now we are left with the task of figuring out how to destroy 
today's lewisite stockpiles without any detriment to our planet 
(6.4 thousand t in the town of Kambarka in Udmurtia and 0.2 
thousand t in the village of Gornyy, Saratov oblast). Moreover, 
a lot of munitions with our lewisite stockpiles were sunk some 
time ago in the Arctic Ocean and buried in the ground at various 
locations in Russia. 
  Historian. The Soviet Army was actively preparing 
to employ three other arsenic-containing substances in the last 
war--adamsite, diphenylchlorarsine, and diphenylcyanarsine. 
Adamsite production was set up at the Kineshma chemical plant 
imeni M.V. Frunze (Ivanovo oblast; it is listed as the adamsite 
plant in the documents). In 1935, the plant capacity reached 
3,000 t/yr, and in 1937, plans to increase it to 10-12,000 t 
with a prospect of raising it further to 17,000 t were reported 
to I. Stalin. Diphenylchlorarsine production was related to the 
operation of the Derbenevsk (Moscow) and Shchelkovo (Moscow 
oblast) plants. From the production viewpoint, production of 
these chemical warfare agents was probably not very complicated. 
  Chemist. What's true is true. The feedstocks for 
producing both items cannot be classified as especially scarce 
(we shall cite one of the synthesis versions): 



  And the approach to producing these substances was also on a 
large scale: in Russia alone, nine plants were producing 
adamsite during the war and at least eight--diphenylchlorarsine 
and diphenylcyanarsine. 
  We should note that the attitude toward arsenic-containing 
chemical warfare agents has undergone a certain evolution. 
Whereas they have been regarded as irritant agents before, today 
these substances are no longer treated as chemical weapons, and 
they are not even mentioned in the Chemical Disarmament 
Convention. Yet arsenic-containing compounds remained an 
environmental weapon or a weapon against ourselves. 
  Historian. This aspect of the problem became 
evident quite a long time ago. Back in 1937, it was reported to 
I. Stalin that there was no satisfactory solution to the problem 
of waste-water treatment in arsenic-containing chemical warfare 
agent production. The issue of discharges was not given high 
priority by the authorities either then or later on. As for the 
fate of chemical munitions, the decision taken by the military 
was surprisingly simple. In one highly classified earlier 
document dated 1989, we read then between 1946 and 1978, 17,543 
aerial bombs with adamsite warheads were sunk by our naval 
forces at two locations in the Baltic Sea. 
  Chemist. I should note, by the way, that today 
much is being said about sinking the captured German munitions. 
This is not so. Most of the munitions were ours. As a matter of 
fact, there were not two but at least ten sinking locations. 
  From the viewpoint of environmental safety, the formulated 
problem is exceptionally urgent. Suffice it to say that the 
Convention signed on 13 January bans such methods of parting 
with chemical weapons as "sinking at any reservoirs, burial in 
the ground, or combustion in the open air." This is why the 
draft program for destroying our chemical weapons was rejected 
on 19 January. It absolutely failed to take into account the 
fact that we had to free ourselves not only from available 
chemical weapons but from much of what had been done many years 
earlier. We are talking about the ecological impact of the 
actions undertaken by our military and related to the 
wide-ranging and thoughtless sinking, burial, and burning of 
hundreds of thousands of tons of old chemical weapons as well as 
the activity of our industry involved in producing these weapons. 
  Phosphorus-Containing Chemical Warfare Agents 
  These 1989 documents provide food for very serious thought. 
For example, one of the documents from the Politburo of the 
Central Committee of the CPSU referring to foreign press reports 
mentions the possible transfer of production technologies of 
some of our chemical warfare agents to Middle Eastern countries. 
Most likely, the agent mentioned is sarin. This is a highly 
toxic phosphorus-containing nerve agent which, as well as soman, 
was produced at the Khimprom Production Association in Volgograd: 



  According to official and most likely, understated data, a 
total of 12,000 t of sarin and 5,000 t of soman were produced in 
the last several decades in our country. These 
phosphorus-containing chemical warfare agents were "packed" in 
various munitions--artillery shells, aerial bombs (sarin), and 
spraying aviation devices (viscous soman). 
  Phosphorus-containing chemical warfare agents classified as 
the so-called V-gases were produced in an even higher quantity 
(15.5 thousand t) at the Khimprom Production Association in 
Novocheboksarsk, Chuvashia. By the way, both our and American 
gases are structurally different although their empirical 
formulas are the same: 



  Today, these phosphorus-containing chemical warfare agents 
are stored, according to official reports, at five arsenals 
scattered throughout Russia--in Kizner (Udmurtia), Leonidovka 
(Penza oblast), Maradykovskoye (Kirovsk oblast), Pochepa 
(Bryansk oblast), and Shchuchye (Kurgan oblast). The issue of 
the methods to destroy chemical warfare agents remains 
absolutely unclear. In any case, it will be a long time before 
these of our "treasures" belong to the domain of history. 
  Historian. The problem of binary chemical weapons, 
primarily phosphorus-containing chemical warfare agents, has 
been actively discussed in foreign press in the last decades. 
Yet even we have not remained on the sidelines. I can recall 
that back in the fall of 1989, our Foreign Minister E. 
Shevardnadze proposed at a session of the UN General Assembly 
that the Americans give up the development of binary chemical 
warfare systems on a parity basis. 
  Chemist. Yes, the development of binary weapons 
and even multicomponent weapons is a complicated technological 
breakthrough and a serious new step in the race toward chemical 
death. The source components (precursors) have a low toxicity 
and are convenient to store, while the synthesis location of the 
highly toxic chemical warfare agent from these components is 
transferred from the reactor at an industrial site directly to 
the munitions. The moment of synthesis occurs during the flight 
toward the probable enemy. Strictly speaking, there can be many 
such binary pairs. For example, the following can be used for 
our V-gas: 


  Yet the issue of binary weapons and phosphorus-containing 
chemical warfare agents in general is a subject for a separate 
conversation; likewise, the issue of environmentally safe 
destruction of chemical warfare agents and environmental cleanup 
of Russia's contaminated territories should be discussed 
separately.

<F P=106> [Article by S.V. Kolpakov, President of International </F>
Metallurgist Union] 
  [Text] On 24 July 92, the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Justice registered the charter of the International Metallurgist 
Union, and this date became the official birthday of the new 
public association. During several months preceding this event, 
the group of sponsors and the coordination council made a great 
effort in learning the metallurgists' opinions about the 
expediency of merging into a union and its likely tasks, status, 
and functions. These efforts culminated in the founding congress 
held on March 27,1992 in Lipetsk which unanimously adopted the 
resolution to set up the union and discussed its charter and 
management bodies. 
  The adoption of this resolution was prompted by the actual 
situation characterized by the negative consequences of 
disrupted economic links and the breakup of a single 
metallurgical complex into components. The output volumes of the 
principal types of production throughout metallurgical 
enterprises of CIS countries in 1992 decreased by 17-24%. 
This 
drop in production continued in 1992 and in relation to 1991 at 
Russian Federation enterprises amounted to 12.5% for 
steel and 
15% for rolled products. The situation in ferrous 
metallurgy in 
Ukraine and Kazakhstan is no better. In nonferrous metallurgy in 
the former USSR republics, the drop in production in 1991 
amounted to 7.7% for primary aluminum and 30.6% 
for secondary 
aluminum, 24.4% for refined copper, 14.4% for 
nickel, 24.\1% 
for zinc, and 19% for rolled nonferrous metals. The 
unavoidable 
metal product price rise (by 26.5 times during the first nine 
months of 1992) proceeded in a jump-like fashion without 
correlation with production costs, which aggravates the gap 
between the financial position of the enterprises even further 
and forces many of them to limit wage increases, cut back 
production staff, and lose skilled personnel. 
  The long-range metallurgy development plans produced earlier 
with a balanced coordination among the subindustries and at a 
territorial level lost their real basis when the former union 
republics became sovereign. The metallurgists understand that it 
would be unreasonable simply to discard them and forget. A joint 
search for new nontraditional decisions is necessary. 
  The database support for the enterprises in the fields of 
production, science and engineering, and economic situation in 
the industry and at the enterprises is continuously shrinking, 
which is fraught with unpredictable consequences even for the 
most well-meaning initiatives of individual enterprises to 
expand their production. At any moment, they may find themselves 
without supplies of the necessary ferroalloys, billets, and 
refractory and other materials. 
  At the founding congress which gathered representatives from 
many enterprises, scientific research institutes, and 
metallurgical organizations from all regions and a number of CIS 
countries, an unambiguous admission was made that their 
separation is a serious obstacle on the road to overcoming the 
crisis and further developing the industry. We need a 
unification vehicle which would not repeat former command 
administrative links but would be consistent with today's 
principles of independent economic activity under the conditions 
of market relations. 
  The historical experience and today's foreign practices 
attest that such associations are possible and are already 
successfully functioning and justifying the hopes of their 
founders and members. 
  The Society of German Metallurgists founded in 1860 is one 
of 
the oldest in the world. According to its charter, its 
objectives are assisting in the technical, scientific-technical, 
and engineering efforts in the field of pig iron, steel, and 
associated material production. Using its own resources, this 
society is carrying out a broad spectrum of scientific and 
engineering research, ensures legal protection of their 
findings, assists young workers in increasing their skill 
levels, and carries out expert (arbitration) activity in its 
sphere. Because of its practical activities, the society has 
acquired a good reputation, its opinion is taken into account by 
the government in adopting resolutions pertaining to German 
metallurgy, and its influence in the structures of the European 
community is noticeable. 
  The rapid development of the industry, power generation, and 
mining in the second half of the 19th Century in Russia 
necessitated the development of societies with a professional 
orientation. Russian technical and physical-chemical societies 
were formed and several years later--the Russian Metallurgical 
Society and a number of others. Large regional associations of 
engineering and technical personnel sprang up. The societies did 
not limit themselves to educational and information 
dissemination activity but carried out extensive organizational 
work and defended the interests of the society members in 
various spheres. They took coordinated positions, e.g., in the 
issues of providing industrial credits and securing government 
orders for domestic enterprises, the development outlook of the 
iron ore and bituminous coal base in the new industrial regions 
of the country, involvement of foreign capital and protection 
from foreign competition, and improvement in the working 
conditions in the mining and metallurgical industry and the 
status of workers and their insurance. The activity of the 
Russian Metallurgical Society is directly related to the names 
of such prominent metallurgists as Chernov, Kurako, 
Grum-Grzhimaylo, and Pavlov who exerted significant influence on 
the development of the metallurgical production science and 
practices. 
  The authority of the newly developed International 
Metallurgist Union includes enterprises and organizations in the 
metallurgical industry in CIS countries; collective (enterprises 
and organization) and individual members from these as well as 
other foreign countries may join it. This is a public 
organization which unites on a voluntary basis engineers, 
scientists, experts, production managers, and social work 
organizers in the metallurgical and mining industries. In its 
activity, the union is guided by Russian Federation legislation 
and international legal standards and the legislation of the 
states which house union departments, as well as its own charter. 
  The union provides representation and protects the interests 
and rights of its members before the authorities and assists in 
effectively utilizing the most recent achievements of science 
and engineering in order to increase the ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy production quality and competitiveness. Union 
functions include drafting and submitting to government bodies 
proposals on issues of metallurgical and mining industry 
development strategy, international division of labor which is 
based on carrying out the necessary research, expert 
examinations, and assessments of domestic and world trends. 
Another important form of activity is supplying union members 
with scientific and engineering and other types of information, 
conducting exhibits, seminars, and symposia, and helping to 
improve business skills. 
  The principal governing bodies--the union council and 
auditing committee--were elected at the founding congress. 
  The Council of the International Metallurgist Union began 
its 
practical activity immediately after its election by the 
congress. In the initial phase, the sponsoring group consisting 
of the council members was forced to carry out extensive work on 
formalizing in an established order the charter documents and 
registering the charter at the Justice Ministry. For greater 
promptness, a council presidium consisting of 17 members and six 
standing committees were set up from among council members at 
the first meeting; the standing committees deal with the 
structural and economical reorganization; modernization 
development strategy and engineering progress; social problems; 
finance and economics; juridical and legal affairs; and 
relations with mass media. One more committee--on foreign 
economic relations--was recently set up. 
  The structure of the union and its regional organizations is 
still being formed while negotiations on cooperation with other 
public organizations, foreign representatives, and companies are 
underway. Relationships with the organizations which form the 
metal products market, i.e., trading houses, brokerage 
associations, and the Roskontrakt Russian contracting authority 
are being established. Proposals to set up specialized banks for 
servicing the market for metals and raw materials for their 
production are in a preparatory stage. 
  Today, we have reached the stage in the union operation 
where 
it is necessary to concentrate the intellectual potential of the 
scientists and experts on generating proposals to bring 
metallurgy from the critical condition and find ways and forms 
of their realization through management bodies. I would like to 
outline several problems on which the International Metallurgist 
Union (MSM) is currently working and which, in our opinion, are 
especially urgent. 
  The problem of shipments under intrabranch cooperation is 
very acute. For many decades, the metallurgical industry has 
developed under the conditions of rigid economic relations and 
has formed a single technological and economic complex. Many 
enterprises are rather narrowly specialized, so the exchange of 
metal products among the regions has been carried out on a scale 
measured in tens of millions of tons, most of which was made up 
by billets for subsequent conversion into rolled products, 
pipes, and hardware. Today, these cooperation links are 
disrupted. The emerging metals market does not yet have the 
necessary structures and attributes and does not create 
favorable conditions for trading relations. On the contrary, 
bereft of reasonable controls allowing for the objective factors 
through a differentiated taxation system, customs duties, and 
quotas, our market has opened up a broad avenue for large-scale 
export of conversion metal to noncontiguous foreign countries 
and made it unprofitable to ship it to enterprises inside Russia 
and to CIS countries. The International Metallurgist Union is 
promoting an initiative to correct this situation. We need a new 
approach which would ensure that the enterprises have incentives 
to ship billets to conversion plants first and foremost. 
  The first problem is directly related to the second--the 
metallurgical enterprises' incentive to improve the quality of 
end products and expand its production for shipment to the world 
market. Today, trading involves primarily metal with a low 
degree of readiness: pig iron, scrap metal, and blanks. Yet even 
quality types of production are often sold at prices 30% 
below 
those in the world market. One of the reason is the fact that 
this production lacks quality certificates issued by specialized 
companies, as is the case with foreign practices. 
  In recent years, work on developing certification centers in 
Russia was undertaken by the ``Sapem-sertifikat'' Joint Stock 
company, one of those founders is the International Metallurgist 
Union. In October 1992, Russia's State Standard Board gave 
``Sapem-sertifikat'' the authority and entrusted it with the 
functions of the central body of the certification system for a 
group of similar goods among which metal products play a 
prominent part. Cooperation in this field with known foreign 
companies has already begun. The union intends to expand these 
efforts in the framework of the functions stipulated by the 
charter aimed at improving the metal products export efficiency 
by adopting a number of governmental resolutions dealing with 
allocation of quotas, export, re-export and licensing rules, etc. 
  Supplying metallurgy with secondary raw material has always 
posed a complex problem here. Today, the situation became simply 
catastrophic. The enterprises and individual persons are no 
longer interested in turning in scrap metal while large 
quantities of scrap metal already procured are exported, 
primarily its most valuable and scarcest types. Scrap purchasing 
and processing enterprises were left without the resources 
necessary for reproducing fixed capital and guaranteeing current 
operations. A real danger has developed that secondary metal 
enterprises may pass to the hands of private persons who will 
increase scrap exports. Today, dramatic measures are necessary 
for effectively utilizing this very valuable type of raw 
material which, in essence, is a part of the national treasury. 
In our opinion, a special resolution must be made in this regard 
at a governmental or presidential level, and we are actively 
pursuing these goals. Special commissions have been set up for 
examining the situation and drafting proposals. 
  Metallurgy in CIS countries is in need of serious 
modernization. The strategy which was developed earlier for this 
purpose is largely unacceptable today due to a change in the 
role of the state, forms of property, and economic activity of 
enterprises. The International Metallurgist Union intends to 
discharge its state obligations of comprehensively assisting 
metallurgy modernization in Russia and other CIS countries. 
  Mindful of how stressed state budgets are, we think that it 
is possible to find new approaches to financing this metallurgy 
modernization by combining it with certain state support. We are 
talking about setting up an off-budget technological development 
and modernization fund whose draft proposal has been prepared 
and approved by the International Metallurgist Union council. 
  Our metallurgy has been developing largely on the basis of 
scientific developments from domestic scientific research 
institutes whose scientific output is highly regarded throughout 
the world. Due to the lack of state financial support, the 
metallurgical science has found itself today in an extremely 
difficult situation. We think that it is possible to extricate 
ourselves from it by setting up national scientific ferrous and 
nonferrous metallurgy centers on the basis of existing 
scientific research institutes. The International Metallurgist 
Union may take the initiative to develop large industry-wide 
metallurgy modernization programs with the participation of 
these centers. The off-budget R&amp;D fund may become the 
financial 
basis of these efforts; it is expedient to form this fund 
through withholdings from the cost of metallurgical production. 
  An industry-wide specialized commercial bank which would 
provide specific and beneficial credits for measures aimed at 
modernizing enterprises and developing capacities for 
manufacturing competitive products should be set up. Obviously, 
it is expedient to obtain long-term interest-free credits, e.g., 
from Russia's Central Bank or the government for shortening the 
initial period necessary to develop the financial basis for 
metallurgical modernization. 
  In discharging its function of legal protection for its 
members, the International Metallurgist Union will also continue 
to give them legal support in resolving internal points of 
contention. To this end, an International Metallurgist Union 
arbitration tribunal has been set up which, on beneficial terms 
and in a short time span, will consider all cases submitted to 
it. It is important that while possessing professional skills in 
the field of metallurgy, the arbitration tribunal is called upon 
to find ways to reconcile the parties and reduce the claimant 
outlays related to the consideration of their cases. 
  Needless to say, several months of the International 
Metallurgist Union activity is a relatively short time for 
preparing and especially implementing serious measures. The 
union is in its formative stages, and new members are still 
joining it. We are not indifferent to the future membership 
makeup of the organization. We are trying to ensure that it is 
replenished with authoritative and skilled experts and 
production leaders characterized by the pride in their work and 
responsible attitude to the future of the industry. During the 
past months, many leaders and prominent experts from metallurgy 
enterprises in CIS countries, scientific research institute 
staff, employees of concerns, Roschermet Corporation, the stock 
market, trading houses, and certain state departments and trade 
unions have become union members. We are hoping that the union 
will continue to expand further by admitting engineering, 
technical, and scientific personnel in the metallurgical and 
mining industries who are committed to their profession and will 
form the intellectual potential of the organization; realization 
of this potential will help solve complicated issues of bringing 
metallurgy out of the critical state and ensuring its future 
balanced developed. 
  Approximately 50 enterprises in organizations from six CIS 
countries which include large integrated iron and steel works, 
specialized plants, scientific production associations, 
institutes, and associations have already joined the 
International Metallurgist Union as collective members. Requests 
have been received about membership terms from several companies 
from noncontiguous foreign countries. It is important to ensure 
that this process continues. Speaking about expanding our 
membership, we must clearly proceed from the principle that the 
union needs enterprises and organizations as the basis for its 
functioning while collective members need the union as the 
organization capable of affecting the resolution of 
contradictions arising due to the new realities of life. 
  It is necessary to emphasize that the newly developed 
metallurgist union does not claim to supplant the functions of 
existing management structures, including metallurgy committees. 
Our primary intention is to assist all union members in various 
states in establishing close contacts on the basis of common and 
mutual interests. Whenever possible, we will undertake to solve 
the problems which are unusual to the new structures but have 
preserved or acquired urgency. The guiding principle of 
interaction with the authorities is mutual respect and 
assistance and the ability to complement each other. Not the 
ambitions but cooperation in the name of normal viability and 
development of industries, enterprises and organizations must 
become the cornerstone of this activity.

Russian Federation Council of Ministers] 
  [Text] Metallurgy is one of the base branches of Russia's 
industries and, along with the fuel and energy complex, largely 
determines the viability of her economy. 
  All large industrially developed countries have or strive to 
have their own effectively operating metallurgical industries. 
The developing countries are also pursuing independence in this 
field and are building large metallurgical facilities. 
  The Russian Federation's proportion of the metallurgical 
complex production among the states formerly comprising the USSR 
is 60%. In Russia, ferrous metallurgy is the principal 
supplier 
of structural materials virtually to all branches of the 
national economy and will retain its importance as a basis 
industry for a long time to come. 
  In addition to the petrochemical and forestry industry 
production, domestic ferrous metals are also finding demand in 
the world market. Export of metallurgical raw materials, 
semifinished products, and individual types of ready products is 
an important source of hard currency revenues necessary both for 
the state as a whole and for the specific metallurgy enterprises 
for the purpose of their retooling and development in the social 
sphere. 
  The potential of Russia's ferrous metallurgy is determined 
by 
the production capacities which make it possible to produce the 
following (in million tons per year):

  The partitioning of the former Soviet Union was accompanied 
by the breakup of the unified metallurgical complex, a sharp 
drop in the effective demand for metal products, and a worsening 
of the export-import shipment situation. Altogether, the 
production volume at ferrous metallurgy enterprises declined by 
17.5% in 1992 compared to 1991. 
  According to expert estimates, consumption of rolled 
products 
in Russia in 1992 decreased compared to the 1991 level by 8 
million tons (15.5%) and that of steel pipes--by 2.6 
million 
tons (28%). At the same time, certain types of metal 
products 
which are the life blood of the state economy did not find 
sufficient demand): these are transportation metal, rails and 
wheels (up to 30% of natural demand, pipes for operating 
gas 
lines and wells (up to 30%), bearing steel (up to 
40%), and 
rope (up to 20%). As a result, the capacity utilization of 
Russia's metallurgical complex facilities (Fig. 1) has declined. 



  Ferrous metallurgy has a number of peculiar features which 
worsen its critical condition and call for considerable efforts 
to resolve the long-overdue interrelated problems. The most 
acute of these are the following: 

  -  an increased material-to-output and energy-to-output 
ratios of production; 
  -  a considerable depreciation of fixed production capital which 
exceeds 50% for the industry as a whole and in a number of 
enterprises--70%, and a low production level with the 
attendant 
poor production quality and competitiveness 
  -  a lack of balance in the subindustries and individual process 
stages, especially due to the disruption of relationships in the 
interbranch and intrabranch cooperation with respect to raw 
materials and semifinished products 
  -  extremely unsatisfactory environmental conditions in the 
regions with the metallurgical industry. 

    A lion's share of metallurgical production in Russia is 
manufactured by obsolete technologies using obsolete and aging 
equipment. More than 60% of steel is smelted in open 
hearth 
furnaces and 75% of steel is cast into ingots. More than 
one-half of rolled stock is produced in equipment which is at 
the 1960s level. Consequently, ferrous metallurgy production has 
elevated specific material consumption and power-to-output 
ratio. For a comparable range of assortment, almost three times 
as much waste is produced per ton of ready rolled stock than in 
Japan while the energy consumption is higher by one-third. As a 
result of an increase in consumption of resources and 
considerable labor outlays compared to today's levels, 
production expenditures at domestic enterprises are in most 
cases higher than the price of metal products in the world 
market, using world prices as a reference. Tentative estimates 
show that even at enterprises with some features of modern 
technologies, the physical and energy outlays per ton of rolled 
products in Russia are $50-70 higher than at today's foreign 
plants. 
  The principal reasons for the energy resource overruns in 
the 
principal process stages are the lower iron concentration in the 
burden, a high fines concentration in the sinter, a high 
proportion of open hearth production, a low proportion of steel 
cast in continuous casting machines (MNLZ), and a large number 
of blooming mills. Due to the technical backwardness of Russia's 
ferrous metallurgy and the resulting high production costs, 
annual losses reach $3.5-4.0 billion. 
  The breakup of the unified metallurgical complex hit 
especially hard the mineral and raw material base of ferrous 
metallurgy. Today, such metallurgical enterprises in Southern 
Urals as the Magnitogorsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works, 
Orsk-Khalilovo Integrated Iron and Steel Works, Chelyabinsk 
Integrated Iron and Steel Works, and partially the Western 
Siberian Integrated Iron and Steel Works use iron ore raw 
materials which are brought from Central Russia (up to 10 
million t/yr) and even from Kazakhstan (up to 9 million t/yr), 
yet stable shipments from these areas are far from being assured. 
  There are no deposits or enterprises which mine manganese 
and 
chromium ores whose principal reserves are located in Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan. The raw material base of the refractory industry 
is insufficient due to the depletion of the Satka magnesite 
deposit as well as the scarcity of fireclay mined in Russia. 
  Due to the considerable obsolescence of capital stock, 
metallurgy is inflicting considerable harm on the environment 
which is estimated to reach 400-450 billion rubles a year. An 
increasing stringency of environmental standards and 
requirements and the introduction of economic sanctions will 
lead to considerable economic losses for enterprises which do 
not meet these requirements. While at foreign plants with a 
total metallurgy cycle and advanced practices equipped with the 
most recent scrubbing equipment, dust ejection into the 
atmosphere reaches 1,000 t/yr per 1 million tons of steel, at 
Russian plants this indicator is several times higher (see 
table).

  Under the conditions where the metal production and 
metallurgical raw material consumption in Russia has decreased, 
the importance of export shipments is on the rise. Since the 
world market for ferrous metals has already evolved almost fully 
and is characterized by traditional ``spheres of influence,'' a 
thorough study of the issue of large metal batch shipments and a 
search for new mutually acceptable forms are necessary for 
penetrating it. 
  Russia's economy has suffered considerable harm due to an 
uncontrolled export of metals, including secondary metals. Thus, 
the use of ferrous metal scrap in production decreased by 6 
million tons in Russia in 1992 for this reason. 
  Today, the Western European and North and Central American 
markets virtually cannot expand due to the high custom duties, 
protectionist measures, and stiff competition. At the same time, 
the importance of traditional Eastern European markets for us is 
increasing while interest in Asian and African markets is on the 
rise. 
  Yet the high resource-to-output ratio of production combined 
with an insufficient quality level lead to a low competitiveness 
of most types of ready products from Russia's ferrous 
metallurgy, and only 10-15% of ready metal products can 
compete 
in the world market: electrical sheet steel (partially), 
reinforcement steel, alloy bars, rails, shipbuilding sheet 
steel, and certain other types as well as semifinished products, 
e.g., pig iron, process stage blanks, and hot-rolled coils. 
  An estimate of the likely internal and external ferrous 
metal 
market capacity makes it possible to predict the production 
volumes of rolled products to be 47-39 million tons in 1995 and 
50-55 million tons in 2000. According to expert forecasts, the 
production, domestic consumption, and exports of rolled products 
(in millions of tons) will stabilize in the next two-to-three 
years and increase somewhat by 2000.

  One should treat this forecast with considerable skepticism 
since it is based on the 1992 macroeconomic indicators which may 
change with time. One should also emphasize that ferrous 
metallurgy is characterized by considerable lagging, so crisis 
phenomena in it may be more prolonged than in the national 
economy as a whole, while the freeing of prices for the energy 
resources will inevitably aggravate the crisis since it will 
result in an invasion of imported metal products under the 
conditions where our enterprises are not competitive. 
  An analysis of the general economic conditions and the state 
of ferrous metallurgy in Russia makes it possible to draw the 
conclusion that if necessary measures in retooling the industry 
and protecting the domestic market from imported metal products 
during the modernization period as well as ensuring a controlled 
price increase for energy resources are not taken, Russian 
metallurgy will virtually cease to exist. 
  Mindful of the world experience and the economic futility of 
winding down domestic metallurgy and aiming at importing metal 
products, Russia is left with no alternatives to radical 
modernization of metallurgical production. 
  At the same time, the performance of enterprises in 1992 
demonstrated that the overhaul and retooling measures in the 
industry, including those taken at government levels, do not 
resolve a number of acute problems in the industry. Mindful of 
the fact that the task of supplying the national economy with 
metal products with the requisite quality and assortment, mostly 
the agroindustrial and fuel and energy complex, developing 
production of durable consumer goods and communication and 
transportation facilities, maintaining Russia's defense 
capabilities at the necessary level, and developing the expert 
potential while increasing the proportion of ready products as 
well as a cardinal improvement in the environmental conditions 
in the metallurgical regions is of paramount importance, the 
Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy developed a draft of 
the national program of "Metallurgy Retooling and Development in 
Russia." 
  Completion of the program will require efforts both on part 
of the state and on part of the Metallurgical Enterprise and 
Scientific Research and Design Institute staff and management. 
The program pinpoints key issues of industrial development and 
outlines the specific and effective ways of resolving them. 
According to the program, a reduction in expenditures for 
production, primarily a decrease in the energy-to-output ratio 
and specific material consumption of production, a decrease in 
labor outlays, and an improvement in production quality 
indicators will be responsible for ensuring the economic 
efficiency of production, profitability of ferrous metallurgy 
enterprises, and guaranteeing that they receive the resources 
necessary for normal operation, including the development of 
their expert potential. 
  Realization of the national program will enable the industry 
to develop on the basis of domestic scientific developments and 
domestic equipment. This will require a system of state support 
for promising scientific developments, preservation of the 
scientific and technical potential, and financing of basic 
scientific research. 
  The retooling of metallurgy must be carried out by 
effectively utilizing the economic capabilities of the 
enterprises themselves and with state support. The principal 
problems whose solution requires state support are as follows: 
lowering the outlays of physical, energy, and labor resources; 
improving the product quality in developing new types of 
products; increasing the product competitiveness; maximizing the 
utilization and developing a domestic raw material base; and 
improving the environmental conditions. 
  State support for retooling may be expressed in various 
forms: the state should primarily make sure that highly 
efficient measures are realized primarily at the expense of 
enterprise profits thus developing the necessary prerequisites 
for the beneficial profit development conditions, e.g., export 
and import duties, credits, tax regulations, etc. 
  The program calls for the following principal technological 
production modernization trends: 

  -  comprehensively utilizing raw materials; 
  -  increasing the ore dressing degree and maximizing the scrap 
metal utilization in order to lower the energy outlays; 
  -  improving the steel melting production structure by replacing 
open hearth furnaces with modern steel melting units with steel 
casting in continuous casting machines; 
  -  setting production of individual types of metal items which 
lower the specific metal content in the national income, 
including cold rolled sheets, corrosion protected metal 
products, cold roll formed sections, etc.; 
  -  minimizing transportation outlays for raw material, 
semifinished products, and ready production shipments and 
outlays of energy resources and other materials; 
  -  maximizing the utilization of the secondary resources forming 
in the national economy. 

    Pursuant to the draft program, 60 installations at 32 
enterprises are being modernized, overhauled, or replaced 
(altogether, there are more than 200 enterprises in ferrous 
metallurgy). 
  It is expected that the national program will be carried out 
in two stages during which the following capacities will be 
brought onstream, in thousands of tons:

  Commissioning of new capacities after implementation of the 
first stage will make it possible to retire obsolete equipment, 
increase the proportion of steel made using advanced processes 
to 53.3% and continuous steel casting--to 31.6%, 
decrease the 
steel consumption for rolled products by 1.4 million tons, coke 
for pig iron--by 2.8 million tons, pig iron for steel--by 1.0 
million tons, and energy resources--by 1 million tons of 
standard fuel. 
  Implementation of the second phase will make it possible to 
increase the proportion of advanced processes to 70% and 
continuous casting--to 69%. Additionally, the metal 
outlays for 
rolled products will decrease by 2.3 million tons, pig iron for 
steel--by 1.8 million tons, and energy resources--by 1.6 million 
tons of standard fuel. 
  The use of new practices will make it possible to improve 
the 
production competitiveness, increase the expert potential, and 
reduce harmful discharges by 2.5-3 times. 
  Realization of high-priority Phase I measures stipulated by 
the national program calls for up to 300,000 tons of equipment 
and for Phase II--approximately 100,000 tons. A list from 
Sukhumi. A list of installed and upgraded equipment necessary 
for implementing the stipulated measures is summarized below:

  Domestic process equipment developed and installed in recent 
years is inferior to similar foreign equipment with respect to 
productivity, reliability, production quality, power-to-output 
ratio, mass, and overall dimensions. Thus, the metal-to-output 
ratio of the slab machines is 20% higher than that of 
similar 
foreign units while the metal casting rate is 30-40% 
lower, 
which considerably decreases their productivity. 
  The domestic machine-building industry does not manufacture 
many types of modern equipment for the fourth process stage 
shops, electrolytic tinplating and chrome plating devices, 
electrolytic cold rolled sheet zinc plating and aluminum plating 
machines, light quenching machines, strip grinding and polishing 
machines, continuous production lines for heat treatment of 
bands, and various types of dressing equipment. Principally new 
devices have not been developed for manufacturing pipes, 
nondestructive welding quality control testing devices, and pipe 
dressing machines. 
  It is patently obvious that metallurgy must be retooled on 
the basis of utilizing modern process equipment while maximizing 
the utilization of domestic machinebuilder capabilities and 
using the experience and developments of the leading foreign 
companies and even bringing them in whenever necessary. At the 
same time, we should vigorously utilize the capabilities of 
military industrial complex (VPK) enterprises which have a 
powerful engineering and production potential. 
  We need a new approach to the operation of design 
organizations. Their principal task has evolved into a thorough 
economic analysis of the conditions at enterprises, developing 
optimum solutions for maintaining and developing the production 
potential allowing for an increase in the competitiveness and 
production quality. As a rule, design decisions must be made on 
a competitive basis. 
  Implementation of the country's national metallurgy 
development program will call for new approaches from builders, 
assembly workers, and clients to construction and modernization 
of installations. Construction and modernization terms of 
complex installations must not exceed 3.5 years and must ensure 
high quality. The contractor for carrying out the work should be 
selected on a competitive basis allowing for the terms, quality, 
and agreed-upon costs. 



  Overall, implementation of the measures outlined by the 
ferrous metallurgy retooling and development program will call 
for 1.6 trillion rubles at today's prices and $6.8 billion (Fig. 
2). Calculations show that the facilities necessary for 
financing the program can be raised due to internal enterprise 
resources and by engaging production user, commercial structure, 
and foreign investor resources (Fig. 3). The shortfall can be 
covered by state support. 



  The Russian government must make the following decisions in 
order to provide assistance at a state level: 

  -  Maintain for the time being the adopted procedure for 
forming centralized off-budget resources due to the cost of 
production. 
  -  Extend to the enterprises participating in national program 
implementation the procedure for acquiring abroad the equipment 
which cannot be manufactured in Russia on the basis of 
credit-compensation transactions. 
  -  Free the enterprises, partially or fully, from paying customs 
duties (both export and import) in exporting the products which 
ensures hard currency earnings for purchases of process 
equipment, spares, and accessory parts. 
  -  Free the enterprises from the mandatory sale of 50% 
of foreign 
currency to the state, provided that it is used for equipment 
purchases. 
  -  Establish a procedure for transferring to the enterprise 
balance sheet the installations built due to foreign exchange 
resources at a special investment exchange rate which reflects 
the real correlation of currencies thus ensuring the 
competitiveness of metal products and largely limiting metal 
price increases. 
  -  The profits used for investment should not be taxed 
regardless 
of the amount 
  National program implementation will make it possible to 
raise 
the technical level of Russia's metallurgy, improve the 
competitiveness of domestic metal products, save jobs, radically 
improve the environmental conditions, and avoid imports. The 
total economic impact will reach approximately $3.0 billion 
annually. It is also expected that the enterprise profits may 
increase by approximately 300 billion rubles due to an 
improvement in the metal production quality and assortment. 
Furthermore, according to expert estimates, elimination of 
imports of one million tons of rolled products will make it 
possible to save approximately 10,000 metalmaker jobs which 
would otherwise require approximately 60 trillion rubles 
necessary to create these jobs. 
  Implementation of the national program measures is based on 
the mutual responsibility of the state and the enterprise: the 
state must ensure financial benefits for the program measures 
while the enterprise--meet the deadlines and ensure that each 
measure is carried out at a technical and economic level 
stipulated by the contract. In all, if the necessary investment 
and state support regime are ensured, the ferrous metallurgy 
modernization program may be largely completed by 2000-2005. 
  A radical modernization of Russia's metallurgy is an 
objective necessity and despite the considerable investments 
necessary for its implementation is economically efficient. 
Realization of the entire program should be ensured by 
implementing the clearly defined comprehensive development 
programs for each enterprise and region which will reflect 
high-priority problems with the specific mechanisms of solving 
them. The Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy and 
economic and commercial structures set up by the metallurgical 
enterprises (corporations, concerns, the international 
metallurgy union, etc.) will participate in developing the 
specific measures under the program. 
  Successful implementation of the program is possible only in 
the case where each metallurgist and metalmaker at his workplace 
clearly understands the objectives and goals of the program and 
makes his own contribution to their realization.

  [Text] In the foreseeable future, steels and alloys will 
remain the principal structural materials; this is dictated by 
the broad range of their physical and mechanical properties, 
relatively low cost, and a well-developed raw material and 
technological production base. 
  The conditions of a market economy determine the 
characteristic features in approaching the development and 
production of new metallic materials,[.sup]1[/] improving 
traditional materials, and using new and improved materials in 
products. Moreover, the new materials play the role of a 
commodity which has the consumer properties satisfying the buyer 
and bring profit to the producer. 
  A number of aspects of the movement of new materials to the 
metal products market is considered in the article. 
  Stimuli and incentives for developing new 
materials. The new metallic materials can successfully 
reach the market under the following conditions: 
1. there are no similar products in the existing market, and 
the use of new materials opens up new opportunities for 
developing products, i.e., a free ``niche'' exists. 
2. existing similar metal products are inferior to the new 
products in quality, and production of new items is more 
profitable. 
  Materials with a completely new set of properties open up 
the 
possibility of developing a new products market. Materials, as a 
rule, are developed simultaneously with designing a product, 
i.e., custom-developed. Examples of this approach are the 
simultaneous development of a new category of amorphous alloys 
and the most recent modifications of pulse transformers and the 
separation of the spheres of influence between metallic soft 
magnetic alloys and semiconductor ferrites. 
  The opposite used to be true, i.e., the new material was 
``looking for'' its applications or, in other words, the product 
was being developed for existing metal. This happened, e.g., 
when superconducting alloys and cryogenic power engineering and 
cryoelectronic products [2] were being developed simultaneously 
on the basis of the discovery of the high-temperature 
superconductivity phenomenon [1]. Production of the principally 
new materials often cannot be realized by traditional production 
methods using conventional equipment and calls for new designs. 
Oriented crystallization of eutectic alloys, impregnation of 
frame matrices with alloys, explosive impact methods, metal film 
sputtering, etc., can serve as examples. 
  As we have already mentioned, these types of materials 
figure 
primarily in the new sector of the metal products market. 
  Another sector of the metal products market is characterized 
by displacement of ``classical'' traditional metal products by 
new materials. In this case, a higher level of properties blazes 
the trail to the market for the new material thus ensuring a 
higher quality of products or their greater adaptability to 
streamlined manufacture, a decrease in production costs, an 
improvement in the product reliability, etc. 
  IF-steels (especially deep drawing and without free 
interstitial atoms) and clad steels for the automotive industry 
are examples of such materials. Materials whose properties are 
at the level of classical analogs yet cheaper due to efficient 
alloying, e.g., nickel-free stainless steel and tungsten-free 
tool steels can also be classified as belonging to this group. 
These classes of materials are developed, as a rule, on the 
basis of improving their production practices (ensuring a 
specified chemical composition, steel purity, more stringent 
allowances, using heat treatment, improving the surface finish, 
etc.). 
  Since materials, as a rule, are semi-finished products for 
making items while the products as a commodity have a certain 
life cycle in their market [3], the life cycle of the material 
also depends on it. For example, metallic and film memory 
elements developed for early-generation computers ceased their 
existence together with these types of computers. High-purity 
metals and alloys developed for designing vacuum tubes in 
early-generation radio and TV devices were also not used in 
subsequent generations of electronic equipment. As a result of 
the further development of these skill-intensive industries, 
metals were no longer used in new-generation products--the metal 
was displaced by semiconductors, ferrites, and other materials. 
The life cycle of a multifunction material, as a rule, is longer 
than that of the materials custom-designed for a specific 
product. 



  Economics of materials with new qualities. The 
development and production management of new or improved 
materials are fraught, as a rule, with additional production 
outlays. In principle, the production process can be arranged in 
such a way so as to ensure a predetermined degree of 
approximation of the physical limits of this class of material 
properties. Yet the economic expediency of such approximation 
under market conditions is far from always justified. An 
analysis demonstrates that each unit of "gain" in properties 
calls for progressively increasing production outlays (Fig. 1). 
The cost of material whose range of properties is close to the 
physical limit C[.sup]0[/] is substantially higher 
than the cost of mass-produced material with a traditional range 
of properties C[.sup]1[/]. For the consumer, it is 
more profitable to deal with a commercial level of properties 
(the C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range) 
which is higher than the traditional level but lower than the 
physical. Under market conditions, the commercial level forms as 
a function of the specific demand for the material, the product 
market opportunities, and the product's specific metal 
consumption. The commercial level of properties may not coincide 
with the design level of properties C[.sup]4[/] 
with respect to the material parameters on whose basis the 
engineering design of the product is made. The degree of 
discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels 
(the difference between the 
C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range and 
C[.sup]4[/]) characterizes the material 
utilization level in the product: given 
C[.sup]4[/]&lt;C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], 
the material properties are underutilized; given 
C[.sup]4[/]&gt; C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], 
the specific metal content in the product increases since the 
shortfall in the property level has to be compensated for by an 
excessive amount of material (e.g., for increasing the net 
section in order to ensure a specified strength or operating 
magnetic induction of the product). 
  In the case where 
C[.sup]4[/]&gt; C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], 
we may be dealing with an economic paradox: despite the 
discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels, 
an elevated metal expenditure may turn out to be economically 
justified if the smaller quantity of metal with higher 
properties costs more than a greater quantity of relatively 
cheaper metal. For this reason, in particular, anisotropic 
electrical sheet steel exposed to laser treatment (the 
properties are improved by 8% and the cost rises by 
15%) has 
limited applications [4]. 
  Consequently, the use of a new material whose applications 
in 
a product ensures a decrease in aggregate production and 
operation outlays compared to the one it substitutes can be 
considered economically efficient. 
  Operating properties, reliability, and competitiveness 
of materials. After the engineering analysis of the product 
is completed, the consumer, in the final analysis, is no longer 
interested by the primary physical characteristics of the 
material (ultimate tensile strength, density, magnetic 
permeability, etc.) but rather the ability of the material as a 
whole reliably to perform certain functions, ensure the 
serviceability of the product, and guarantee the lowest 
manufacturing outlays (adaptability to production). Naturally, 
these comprehensive characteristics are largely determined by 
the primary ones yet the final assessment of the material (the 
material fits or does not fit) is made only in conjunction with 
the product and by the product's market suitability, i.e., the 
product's consumer appeal and economic characteristics. 
  The operating properties of the material and supply 
reliability must be ensured by the manufacturer technology 
level. The metal consumer must be confident in the producer's 
goods. Thus, as a result of many years of tradition at American 
automotive companies, a certain procedure developed in the 
relationships with metal suppliers. Each car part is made from 
metal supplied by only one vendor who managed to 
attain consistently high quality of metal products. Such 
producers are awarded quality certificates by the automotive 
plants. Such a quality certificate enables the metal supplier to 
hope that car manufacturers "will let them supply one more 
part." The USS Corporation is one of the first U.S. 
metallurgical companies supplying automotive sheets and it has 
received Ford and Chrysler quality certificates. 
  In certifying metal products, the Ford Motor Company 
proceeds 
from meeting the four principles of interrelation with metal 
suppliers: 

  -  the quality of metal supplied (50 points on a scale of 
100); 
  -  timely and predictable shipments (20 points) 
  -  metal product price (20 points) 
  -  supplier participation in jointly developing and finishing 
the 
metal products together with the user (10 points). 
  -  It is important that the price competition is assigned 
priority 
number three (20 points) while the shipment quality and 
regularity move to the forefront (a total of 70 out of 100 
points!). 

    Foreign (especially Japanese) automobile producers [5] are 
being increasingly transplanted to the United States in recent 
years. Japanese automobile manufacturers have established that 
the automobile body sheet produced by metallurgical enterprises 
in the United States and used by American customers does not 
meet Japanese requirements [6]. An assessment of 14 quality 
parameters shows that American steel is inferior to Japanese 
with respect to the seven most important parameters (the coat 
quality, surface finish, suitability for drawing, geometric 
tolerances, etc.). Thus, the automobile body sheet market 
becomes closed, and it is very difficult for nontraditional 
metal producers to penetrate it. It is expected that competition 
will heat up even more in the automobile body sheet market due 
to the fact that construction of units for applying coats in a 
number of countries (Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, 
and South Korea) has acquired elements of obsession according to 
the analytical report by P. Marcus to the Eighth Congress of 
``Ferrous Metallurgy Survival Strategy'' held in 1992. 
Furthermore, in a short run, ``...a major battle will develop 
among plastic and aluminum sheets and various types of clad 
steels in the automobile body sheet market'' [7].

  A general assessment of the service properties of materials 
can be complemented by the concept of material reliability which 
is especially important for the material operating under extreme 
conditions. Reliability is a comprehensive material 
characteristic and determines its ability to ensure the product 
serviceability within a specified time interval under the effect 
of external damaging factors [8]. A classification of the 
external factors and the character of the resulting metal damage 
are summarized in the table. The character of the material 
damage development under a constant effect of a certain external 
factor (or a group of factors) where the operating parameter 
changes exponentially with time (Fig. 2) is representative. The 
product fails when the working parameter goes beyond the 
operating range 
P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/]. The 
reliable material operation span (Curve 2) may be 
increased by stabilizing treatment, e.g., aging or thermal 
cycling. Ensuring reliability is the most important condition of 
guaranteeing the ability of the material to perform its 
operating functions. A guarantee of reliability calls for 
additional material producer and supplier outlays related to 
more stringent production practices, the need for stabilizing 
treatments, accelerated reliability tests, and reliability 
forecasts. 



  Another important aspect of the issue of ensuring product 
reliability which depends on the material is its maintainability 
[8], i.e., preserving the necessary product performance level by 
changing the failed material. This problem is related to the 
supplier's ability to provide materials whose parameters are at 
the level of the initial parameters of the failed material. For 
the material supplier, solution of this problem involves 
adjusting the technology for producing metal batches with 
identical properties, improving the chemical, structural, phase, 
and geometrical homogeneity of the metal which leads to 
additional production costs due to the need to maintain a high 
level of production culture, stringent requirements for the raw 
material quality and homogeneity, etc. In this case, the 
question of what is more economically expedient--to tighten up 
the production process in order to prevent rejects or allow a 
certain amount of rejection but ensure that off-grade metal is 
taken out [9]--cannot be a priori answered 
unambiguously. 



  The coincidence of the properties of the original (failed) 
material and its substitution has a probablistic character and 
is described by a material property distribution curve with a 
transition from batch to batch as well as within each batch. The 
narrowing of the distribution curve by technological methods or 
rejecting the metal which does not fall within the operating 
parameter range 
P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/](P&lt;P[.sub]1[/] 
and P&gt; P[.sup]2[/]) also leads to 
additional producer costs. In the case where the practices are 
tightened up in order to optimize the material produced with 
respect to several parameters, we are witnessing the narrowing 
the volumetric distribution curve. For example, for the two 
parameters P and S (Fig. 3), optimization 
means that both parameters fall within area 1-2-3-4. Naturally, 
this problem is much more complex than optimization by a single 
parameter. At times, different parameters have opposite behavior 
trends in which case the optimization task becomes even more 
complicated. 
  The problem of metal homogeneity is directly related to the 
issue of the product's specific metal consumption. The 
reliability of the entire structure depends not only on the 
specific characteristics of the material, but also on the cross 
section margin necessary for decreasing the metal damage 
probability due to local deviation of the characteristics from 
the mean specific value. The probability of local deviations is 
determined by the material homogeneity, i.e., the distribution 
curve and, in the final analysis, the degree of technological 
rigidity. 
  As we have already mentioned, a guarantee of reliability is 
especially important for materials under extreme conditions. 
Thus, e.g., according to data in [10], the requirements imposed 
on the materials used in making sea-based aircraft are more 
stringent in a number of cases than those for space equipment (a 
high strength combined with a low specific gravity, resistance 
to cyclical loads in a corrosive medium at temperatures of up to 
1,150Î, etc.). Composite metallurgy methods (production of 
composites on the basis of intermetallic compounds), powder 
metallurgy methods (engineering ceramics and materials for 
specialty bearings operating in corrosive media under high loads 
and high temperatures), single crystal and quasisingle crystal 
metallurgy, and specialized coat application methods (heat 
protecting, corrosion resistant, etc.) are used for developing 
such materials for specific products. 
  According to forecasts by the Japanese Ministry of Trade and 
Industry [11], the need for specialty materials for operation 
under extreme conditions will increase rapidly and by 2000 
exceed the 1989 consumption level by several times. This is 
primarily true for the following classes of materials: 
intermetallic compounds with a high strength and heat 
resistance, alloys with a high resistance to biological and 
physiological media, and high-temperature superconductors. The 
demand for materials which determine energy conservation and 
microelectronics development [11, 12], i.e., amorphous alloys, 
microheterogeneous (including nanocrystalline) alloys, 
multilayer composites (including metal-ceramics), materials with 
an amorphized surface, and hydrogen accumulating materials for 
hydrogen engines, etc., will increase sharply. New modifications 
of traditional materials must also be developed, e.g.: stainless 
steel micrometer-thick fibers for woven materials and screens, 
reinforced concrete in seismically resistant structures and 
nuclear reactors, and reinforced refractory products [12]. The 
issues of developing the aforementioned classes of materials are 
resolved especially effectively in places where material 
producer and item producer integration has been achieved. 
  An analysis shows that one can win customers in a saturated 
market only by offering a commodity which has advantages 
compared to competing products and which meets user demands at a 
higher level. Under these conditions, the metal product 
competitiveness becomes especially important [13]. 



  The competitiveness of metal products as a commodity is a 
comparative comprehensive estimate of the totality of 
qualitative and economic properties (parameters) relative to the 
market requirements or the properties of a similar (or 
substituted) commodity. A quantitative estimate of the 
competitiveness level K is made on the basis of 
developed procedures [14] and, in the final analysis, is 
expressed through the free parametric quality index 
I[.sup]p[/] and the free parametric economic index 
I[.sup]c[/] (the difference between the quality 
parameters of this commodity and a similar commodity per unit of 
production outlays): 
  K = 
I[.sup]p[/]/I[.sub]c[/]. 
  Given K&gt; 1, the commodity is more competitive than 
the analog while given K&lt;1, it is less so. The metal 
product competitiveness level is especially sensitive to the 
range of consumer appeal (I[.sup]p[/]) at low 
outlays--small fluctuations in the value of the 
I[.sup]p[/] index require a high degree of 
customer satisfaction with quality in order to maintain a high 
level of competitiveness (Fig. 4). Thus, the nonprice 
competition factors come to the forefront at low outlays. This 
is taken into account by experienced material producers [15]. In 
practice, the situation with assessing the competitiveness is 
much more complicated since the I[.sup]p[/] and 
I[.sup]c[/] indices are independent. Thus, 
according to data in [16], an increase in the degree to which 
the metal product consumer requirements are met (the 
I[.sup]p[/] index) from 90 to 95% is fraught with 
almost doubling the metal producer outlays (the 
I[.sup]c[/] index). On the other hand, production 
of higher-quality items gradually leads to a decrease in 
production outlays due to an increase in the production quality 
and a decrease in rejections and outlays for additional product 
finishing [15]. 
  In penetrating the free market, the new producers must take 
into account all possible factors. We can cite examples where 
given similar expenditure and consumer appeal levels, the 
materials capture markets due to traditional customer loyalties. 
Thus, the well-known can war led to a division of the metallic 
beverage container market: the Coca Cola Company prefers 
aluminum cans while Pepsi Cola--steel cans [17]. 
  Material property standardization principles. As 
we have already mentioned, while possessing a broad range of 
diverse properties, the same types of metal products, as a rule, 
are used in items for very different purposes, i.e., are 
multifunctional. This determines the specific features of 
unifying the properties in standards and other regulatory 
technical documents. 
  In standardizing production, the indicators used in all 
application versions must be mandatory (base); the remaining 
requirements are optional and become mandatory only upon 
additional agreement (contract) between the producers and 
consumers. Sometimes, it is sufficient to have reliable 
reference data on a range of properties cited in an appendix to 
the standard or a supplier company catalogue. This approach 
takes into account the mutual interest of the producers and 
consumers and ensures their constructive technical dialogue and, 
in the final analysis, metal product utilization effectiveness. 
This standardization principle is widely used in foreign 
standards and is reflected in all newly developed domestic 
regulatory technical documents. 
  The set of properties for new materials for specific 
purposes 
(developed for the specific product) must be standardized and 
mandatory with respect to the service characteristics of the 
product indicating the procedures for measuring these properties. 
  The chemical element composition standards for steel and 
alloy properties for specific applications must be strictly 
regulated. For multifunction metal products, rigid 
standardization of the chemical composition is unacceptable 
since in order to ensure a specific range of requested 
properties, one must be able to manipulate the chemical 
composition to a certain extent. 
  Depending on whether the product is crucial, the 
requirements 
for the level to which the properties regulated by the standards 
are ensured differ. Thus, experience shows that for metal 
products used in construction, this norm is at least 0.95 but 
for more crucial applications--0.97 or more. In addition to the 
requirement to ship products in accordance with international or 
national standards of technically advanced countries, the 
manufacturer penetrating an external market must ensure that all 
contract requirements are met and guarantee the quality 
stability of the shipped products which, as a rule, is confirmed 
by the export production certification by acknowledged 
international or national societies (the British Lloyd Register, 
the German TGF, the American Oil and Gas Institute, etc.) 
  One should keep in mind that certification of the product 
shipped is an initial phase of certification as a supplier 
warranty, while certification of the system ensuring the quality 
in effect at the manufacturing enterprise should serve as the 
concluding phase. The requirements for ensuring the quality 
system are described in ISO 9000 standards [18]. 
<H5>  Summary </H5>
  The specific features of the development, production, and 
application of new metallic materials under market economy 
conditions are considered. Under the conditions where new 
materials become a market commodity, such market material 
characteristics as competitiveness, new property standardization 
principles, commercial quality level, life cycle, and the ratio 
of the material and product economics are significant. These 
categories determine the ability of the new materials to become 
a commodity profitable for both the producers and the consumers.

Organization of Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy; UDC 334:669.2] 
  [Text] Russia's metallurgical complex consisting of 
hundreds of independent enterprises and ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy organizations represents 24 large subbranches of the 
industry each of which has clearly defined specific features of 
production, its own practices, equipment, units and machines, 
and specially trained personnel. In essence, each subbranch is 
an independent base branch of the industry with a high value of 
fixed capital. 
  Mining operations have a discrete and cyclic character and 
depend on the systematically changing natural conditions (the 
tempo and scale of geological exploration efforts, the 
availability of mineral deposits and their quality, the deposit 
occurrence conditions and location, etc.). 
  Most ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are 
characterized by a continuity of production processes and the 
availability of numerous installations with a high unit capacity 
closely interrelated in a single production process. 
Furthermore, individual subindustries and enterprises are linked 
to each other by constant cooperative shipments. 
  The high capital-to-output ratio of mining and metallurgical 
production and a continuous increase (in recent years) in the 
fast metal production tempo without sufficient capital 
investments for replacing the fixed capital led to a sharp drop 
in operating ore extraction production capacities and wear and 
obsolescence of the capital stock. 
  The production processes used in production systems 
operating 
in metallurgy can explain the rather complicated and tense 
environmental situation which developed in various vast Russian 
regions. Suffice it to say that atmospheric discharges of 
harmful substances by metallurgical complex enterprises reach 
27% of all Russian enterprise discharges while 
contaminated 
water effluents exceed 15%. 
  The need to address a broad range of global issues related 
to 
decreasing harmful substance discharges over large territories 
and air and water space and improving the working conditions and 
daily life of metallurgical enterprise workers led to 
considerable increases in the cost of production and a drop in 
the effectiveness and profitability of individual productions, 
enterprises, and subindustries since improvements in the air and 
water quality involve considerable expenditures. 
  Thus, operating metallurgical complex enterprises are 
characterized by the high cost of fixed capital and its 
considerable wear and obsolescence (more than 50%), vast 
outlays for solving environmental and social problems, and the 
existence of marginally profitable or unprofitable 
infrastructure both at enterprises and individual subindustries. 
  The economic reforms which have been carried out in recent 
years and involve changes in managing the enterprises and the 
industry as a whole, improving cost accounting, self-financing, 
raw material and metal price deregulation, profit taxation, and 
limitations in the wage fund did not sufficiently take into 
account (or to be more precise, did not take into account at 
all) these very important characteristics of mining, dressing, 
mining-metallurgical, and processing enterprises in Russia's 
basic industry of the national economy--metallurgy. 
  As a result, instead of stabilization and an increase in the 
production effectiveness, we are witnessing its sharp decrease, 
while the mining extractive and metallurgical enterprises which 
produce metals and items crucial for other enterprises and 
industries have become marginally profitable or unprofitable. 
The situation in the metallurgical complex is continuing to 
deteriorate, pig iron and steel production and smelting are 
dropping, rolled stock and steel pipe production is declining, 
and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are in a critical state 
due to a deterioration of their supplies of raw material 
resources and intensive retirement of ore capacities from 
operation. 
  An analysis of the status quo in metallurgy demonstrates 
that 
by late 1992, the drop in the production of individual types of 
metals will reach 50% compared to the preceding year 
which, in 
turn, will lead to an even greater reduction in the production 
volume in mechanical engineering and the output of industrial 
goods for consumer use. 
  The principal reasons of the declining production in 
metallurgy are shortfalls in the shipments of coking coal, a 
considerable scarcity of scrap metal due to the absence of 
market mechanisms for its collection and an increasing volume of 
its imports, a sharp decrease in mining and metallurgical 
equipment shipments, a noticeable and ever-increasing gap 
between the economic and business links under intergovernmental, 
interbranch, and industry-wide cooperation, and the lack of 
economic and social incentives for stabilizing and increasing 
the production volume and stable financial conditions of the 
enterprises. 
  The measures taken in 1992 to deepen the economic reforms 
which involve divestment and privatization of enterprises 
pursuant to the state privatization program and Russian 
Federation Presidential Decree No. 721 of 1 Jul 92 which cite as 
an example the critical situation which has developed in the 
metallurgical complex lead to a rather definite conclusion: the 
economic reforms already underway call for a radical correction 
in order to take into account the characteristic features of the 
basic branches of industry without which future realization of 
the measures to expand and deepen the privatization processes 
becomes questionable and reinforces the continuing slide and 
decrease in the production effectiveness. 
  The state privatization program of state and municipal 
enterprises in 1992 is largely aimed at privatizing small- and 
medium-size enterprises in the retail trade, consumer services, 
and transportation spheres whose balance sheets show a 
relatively low cost of property and does not take into account 
the characteristic features of large enterprises which include 
most of metallurgical complex enterprises. 
  Furthermore, the cost of property has risen substantially by 
the end of 1992 due to a multiple increase in the cost of 
working capital which, in a number of cases, exceeded the cost 
of fixed capital by tens and hundreds of times. 
  This jump-like increase in the cost of enterprise property 
limited the ability of the employees to buy out this property 
and required a more detailed analysis and economic feasibility 
of the issues related to assessing the cost of property, 
classifying the enterprise infrastructure objects according to 
various forms of property, and taking into account the interests 
of kindred industries which are a part of a consolidated 
production process with the privatized enterprise in buying out 
a proportion of shares of the joint stock company formed on the 
basis of this enterprise. 
  With respect to the foregoing, the deadlines set up by the 
presidential decree for transforming state enterprises into 
publicly traded joint stock companies (by 1 Nov 92) turned out 
to be unrealistic and led to hasty, economically unjustified, 
and at times inefficient decisions. 
  Thus, out of the total number of metallurgical complex 
enterprises and organizations already transformed into joint 
stock companies in 1992, no more than 25% of such 
entities met 
the deadline (1 Oct 92) in holding employee meetings 
(conferences) and submitting the necessary privatization 
documents to the Russian Federation government, Russian 
Federation State Committee on Property, and committees for 
controlling the property of local administrations. 
  Among the large metallurgical complex enterprises which 
successfully, and in a timely fashion, completed the preparation 
and submission of the necessary documents (privatization plans, 
property assessment documents, and joint stock company articles 
of incorporation) to appropriate state property control bodies 
for converting them into publicly traded joint stock companies, 
one should especially note the Uralruda Production Mining 
Association, the Mikaylovsk Mining Ore Dressing Complex, the 
Cherepovets Integrated Iron and Steel Works, the Berezniki 
Titanium-Magnesium Works, the Achinsk Alumina Combine, the 
Khrustalnyy Mining Ore Dressing Works, the Pervouralsk Tube 
Making, Chelyabinsk Tube Rolling, and Uralsk and Irkutsk 
Aluminum Plants, the Krasnyy Vyborzhets Leningrad Production 
Association for Nonferrous Metal Treatment, and others. 
  A number of metallurgical enterprises has been privatized 
and 
registered in appropriate bodies and are carrying out productive 
and economic activity in the framework of a publicly traded 
joint stock company (the Tulachermet Scientific Production 
Association, the Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, the 
Kandalaksha Aluminum Smeltery, the Domodedovo Refractory Plant, 
and the Solnechnogorsk Metallurgical Screen Plant). 
  We should note that the preliminary technical and economic 
analyses and subsequent feasibility studies and timely and 
proper preparation of founding documents for privatization at 
most of these enterprises were carried out with the help of the 
Central Scientific Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy, 
Central Scientific Research Institute of Nonferrous Metallurgy 
Economics and Information, Center for Scientific Organization of 
Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy, and other scientific research 
organizations. 
  Yet for a number of reasons, particularly due to the absence 
of the necessary regulatory documents, e.g., statutes of 
enterprise employee stock funds (FARP), the procedure for 
transferring blocks of shares to trusts, the rate of land taxes, 
mineral use taxes, etc., privatization documents submitted on 
time for consideration and approval by the majority of 
enterprises are being considered past the deadlines established 
by the presidential decree. 
  The unsolved problems in the banking and credit system and 
the delinquency in payments for supplier products have largely 
prevented timely preparation of documents for transforming 
enterprises into joint stock companies. 
  The abnormal situation which has developed due to nonpayment 
at mining and metallurgical enterprises and the forthcoming 
surge in the injection of money due to the energy resource price 
liberalization will call for urgently addressing the issues of 
replenishing the working capital, indexing the cost of property, 
eliminating the cash deficit at the enterprises, expanding the 
checking and noncash transactions, accelerating the interbank 
clearing, and increasing the responsibility of the banks which, 
in contrast to enterprises, are successfully functioning and 
flourishing in their financial and economic activity. 
  A classification of metallurgical complex enterprises 
according to the possibility of their privatization in 1992 
pursuant to the state privatization program demonstrates that 
most of these enterprises (about 67%) must be privatized 
in 
coordination with local property management committees. The 
remaining enterprises (except for those which have already been 
transformed into joint stock companies) must be privatized in 
coordination with the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Property (20%) and Russian Federation government 
(12%). 
  The experience of local property management bodies 
considering the privatization documents submitted by enterprises 
attests that the privatization committees set up within these 
bodies are physically incapable of properly and in a timely 
fashion considering and coordinating the large volume of 
articles of incorporation and take into account the industrial, 
production-technical, and socioeconomic characteristics of the 
enterprise activity. 
  The fact that authoritative bodies represented by the 
Metallurgical Industry Department (today--Russian Federation 
Committee on Metallurgy), namely such structures as concerns, 
companies, associations, joint stock companies, and scientific 
research institutes have been virtually prevented from 
developing the organizational-technical and economic measures to 
transform state enterprises into joint stock companies, is a 
serious drawback in managing the privatization efforts. 
  As a result, the privatization plans being developed by the 
enterprises themselves do not include the most important 
measures aimed at increasing the operating efficiency of the 
enterprises and developing incentives for a production volume 
stabilization and increase and for a stable financial position, 
i.e., enterprise transformation into joint stock companies and 
privatization become an end in itself. 
  An analysis of enterprise privatization efforts in the 
industry shows that the enterprises which possess sufficient 
resources to set up a privatization fund and which have formed 
this fund in a timely fashion and introduced personal 
privatization accounts for employees are the ones that prepared 
and submitted privatization documents on time and selected 
benefits version, II which is the most profitable and acceptable 
to the employees. 
  From the total number of enterprises prepared for 
transformation into joint stock companies, almost three-quarters 
selected benefits version II which ensures redemption of 
51% of 
the entire block of shares and makes it possible to guarantee 
the controlling block of shares for the enterprise. Highly 
profitable aluminum production enterprises, tube mills, and 
nonferrous metal processing plants are dominant in this group of 
enterprises. 
  At privatized enterprises with marginal profitability and 
limited resources to set up sufficient privatization funds 
ensuring redemption of the controlling block of shares, 
22% of 
employee groups selected version I benefits. This version was 
selected by employees of the Mikhaylovsk and Lovozerskiy Mining 
Ore Dressing Combines, the Northern Onega Mine, the Ufaleynikel 
Production Association, Berezniki Titanium-Magnesium Works, 
Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, and others. 
  Only the employees at individual small enterprises (the 
Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant and the Krasnoyarsk Vtortsvetmet 
Secondary Nonferrous Metals State Enterprise) selected benefits 
version III which provides for giving a small group of 
enterprise employees (under certain contractual conditions) the 
right and possibilities to carry out the privatization plan. 
  Several employee groups which leased the property of small 
state enterprises expressed the desire to convert to a limited 
liability partnership and buy it out. 
  For most of the remaining metallurgical complex enterprises, 
the conditions of their transformation into joint stock 
companies provided by the state privatization program do not 
enable the employees to buy out a large proportion of state 
property shares since, on the one hand, the enterprises do not 
possess a sufficient privatization fund formed primarily due to 
a surplus of economic incentive funds and after-tax profits, 
while on the other--employees at the enterprises selecting 
benefits version I are limited to 20 minimum monthly wages in 
the case of a gratuitous transfer of a part of preferred shares 
and when selling regular shares at a discount--to 6 minimum 
monthly wages per employee. 
  The option of purchasing 51% of shares is virtually 
unrealistic for large metallurgical enterprises with the high 
cost of capital stock since the selling price of such shares in 
accordance with the statutes of closed subscription of shares 
under state and municipal enterprise privatization approved by 
the Russian Federation State Committee on Property increases by 
a factor of 1.7. 
  The fact that the privatization program does not call for 
the 
possibility of privatized enterprise share redemption at par 
value by juridical persons whose share of state property exceeds 
25% decreases the activity and efficacy of the program and 
makes it impossible to involve the suppliers and consumers 
closely related by cooperative deliveries in redeeming the 
shares of the entities they are interested in. 
  The experience of enterprise privatization plan development 
with respect to searching for the resources to redeem shares 
demonstrates that most enterprises have forwarded to the 
privatization fund resources from their profits at the expense 
of other important profit utilization applications. As a result, 
financing of social programs and investments for the development 
of production and new equipment has been sharply reduced or 
terminated at these enterprises altogether. 
  We should note that to a certain extent, the Russian 
Federation Presidential Decree ``On Developing the System of 
Privatization Vouchers in the Russian Federation'' published in 
October 1992 solves this problem; it stipulates that in selling 
the privatized enterprise stock, the total number of shares to 
be sold for privatization vouchers to the joint stock companies 
developed in the course of privatization by converting state 
enterprises which are a property of the Russian Federation is 
equal to 80% and for enterprises which are a property of 
the 
constituent republics within the Russian Federation--35% 
of the 
total number of ordinary and type B preferred shares. Moreover, 
pursuant to the resolution of these republics' supreme councils, 
the total number of shares to be sold for privatization vouchers 
may be increased to 80%. This measures makes it possible 
considerably to expand the privatization scale if the 
enterprises do not have sufficient resources to set up 
privatization funds, reduce the use of profits for these 
purposes, and direct profits to social needs and production 
development. 
  A number of unsolved problems which lower the employee 
incentive to accelerate privatization has been revealed in the 
course of assessing the capital stock cost at mining, ore 
dressing, and mining and metallurgical enterprises in order to 
determine their authorized capital. 
  An important characteristic of property formation in this 
group of enterprises is the considerable proportion of the 
exploratory, capital, and preparatory operations in mining in 
the cost of capital stock. This is a peculiar type of property, 
and it does not appear possible either to sell it or use it for 
other purposes in the subsequent period since this property is 
subject to liquidation and write-off after a certain time (as 
the deposit is being depleted). 
  Consequently, it appears necessary to subtract the cost of 
this peculiar property in determining the authorized capital in 
order to accelerate the development of joint stock companies on 
the basis of marginally profitable mining extracting enterprises 
and providing an even playing field for them among other 
enterprises. 
  It is also necessary to subtract from the authorized capital 
the cost of environmental protection installations which is 
reflected in the cost of fixed capital since maintenance of 
these facilities involves considerable outlays yet does not 
guarantee profits while not only the enterprise employees, but 
also the entire population of the region derive benefit from 
their operation. 
  The aforementioned facilities must be transferred to the 
balance sheet of joint stock companies without compensation 
under an appropriate agreement. 
  The issues related to increasing the competitiveness of 
metal 
products in the external market, expanding the enterprises' 
export possibilities, developing production of scarce import 
substituting products, developing an ore and raw material base 
for stabilizing the enterprise operation, and creating new 
technologies and equipment which have been completely ignored in 
the enterprise privatization plans are especially acute at the 
privatized enterprises of the metallurgical complex. 
  At the stage of enterprise conversion to joint stock 
companies, it is necessary to develop special programs (business 
plans) to implement these high-priority trends and set up the 
sources and volumes of their financing, including the method of 
setting up subsidiary joint stock companies. 
  Holding companies as well as trust companies which possess 
blocks of stock (a share) which belong to the government and 
carry out these necessary investments in order to implement 
these programs due to the dividends derived from these shares 
could become the institutional management framework for the 
corresponding programs in various subindustries. Business plans 
must become part and parcel of enterprise privatization plans 
and should be considered and approved by the Russian Federation 
Government and State Committee on Property and by appropriate 
property management committees. 
  Conversion of large metallurgical complex enterprises into 
joint stock companies requires time, serious preparation, and an 
accounting of the characteristic features of the industries, the 
character of operations, and the outlook for the technical and 
economic development of each enterprise.

  [Text] The history of Russian light alloy metallurgy which 
served as the basis for subsequent formation of the aerospace 
technology in the former USSR dates back to the commissioning of 
the first specialized aluminum rolled stock mill 60 years ago. 
  The birth and constant dynamic development of aviation 
engineering in the 1930s were inextricably linked to 
improvements in the equipment and practices of casting ingots, 
manufacturing various types of metallurgical semifinished 
products, developing alloys, and expanding their applications in 
the aircraft industry. 
  Aviation metallurgy achieved tremendous success during the 
Great Patriotic War when an industrial base was created in the 
shortest time in the eastern part of the country, complex 
methods of manufacturing high-quality metal products were 
implemented at new plants, and scientific research work aimed at 
increasing aircraft ``survivability'' and improving their flight 
performance was carried out. 
  The use of light alloys in space technology, shipbuilding, 
and other areas of new technologies on a wider scale began in 
the postwar years. As a result, aviation metallurgy is becoming 
specialty metallurgy of light alloys and 
organizationally--subordinated to the USSR Ministry of Aviation 
Industry as a metallurgical department; at present, it is a part 
of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy. 
  The following landmarks characterize the postwar development 
of specialty metallurgy: 

  -  mastering continuous casting of aluminum alloy ingots and 
subsequently improving it by introducing vacuum melt treatment 
using electromagnetic molds, group casting, etc.; 
  -  developing and bringing on stream high-output vertical 
hydraulic presses with an up to 750 MN force for producing 
large-size stampings as well as horizontal presses with an up to 
200 MN force and mastering on their basis production of large 
extruded sections and panels 
  -  developing and mastering multistand hot and cold rolling 
mills 
which ensure production of a broad assortment of slabs, sheets, 
and bands for aircraft manufacturing and for other engineering 
fields; 
  -  mastering and implementing titanium, high-temperature, and 
refractory alloys and new melting methods (vacuum arc, electron 
beam, and electroslag remelting) which make it possible to 
produce alloys with a higher doping level in order to increase 
the strength, heat resistance, and other properties of materials; 
  -  producing high-temperature nickel, titanium, and aluminum 
alloys by the granular metallurgy method based on utilizing 
rapid solidification and hot isostatic pressing and production 
of billets by the methods of powder metallurgy, isothermal 
stamping, diffusion welding, etc. 
  -  Specialty metallurgy made a significant contribution to 
solving 
complex problems related to the development of modern aviation 
equipment at a high scientific and engineering level: these are 
the Buran spacecraft, the Mriya AN-225 aircraft with the highest 
load lifting capacity in the world, the comfortable civilian 
aircraft IL-96-300, TU-204, and IL-114, the newest military 
aircraft MIG-31, MIG-29, and SU-27, the Ka-32 and Mi-26 
helicopters, highly efficient PS-90 and TV7-117 engines, support 
aircraft, and other flying vehicles which are equal to the best 
developments in the world. 

    Today, specialty and light alloy metallurgy in industrially 
developed countries occupies one of the leading spots in various 
types of rolled stock production. The assortment of semifinished 
products produced has been expanded considerably, production of 
especially large deformed products has been mastered, and the 
quality indicators have been improved substantially. 
Semifinished products from nickel-based alloys, refractory 
metals, and aluminum-lithium alloys have been mastered and 
implemented extensively. 
  A stable ratio has developed--40% of light alloy 
blanks are 
used in aviation and specialty technologies and 60%--in 
the 
national economy. This subindustry production largely determines 
the possibilities of engineering progress in the production of 
computer equipment, electronics, radio engineering, nuclear 
power, construction, production of containers and packaging, and 
other branches of the national economy. 
  In Russia, virtually all structural rolled stock from 
aluminum, titanium, and a number of specialty alloys is produced 
at eight specialty metallurgy plants: the SMK, SaMZ, KUMPO, 
BKMPO, VSMPO, KMPP, KraMZ, and VILS. 
  Specialty metallurgy is characterized in that it represents 
a 
through technological production cycle--from smelting ingots to 
developing ready products (including those with a high degree of 
precision) for subsequent use in the mechanical engineering 
complex. High-production processes which ensure production of 
billets from light alloys of the requisite quality have been 
implemented at all production stages. 
  The principal types of rolled stock are large-size slabs and 
sheets from high- strength thermally hardened aluminum alloys. 
This rolled stock makes it possible to reduce the number of 
fastening joints in the structure thus considerably decreasing 
the product mass. 
  Today, new practices have been developed for hot and cold 
rolling of slabs and sheets with a variable cross section along 
the length whose macro- and microstructure and mechanical 
properties correspond to the sheets and slabs with a constant 
cross section in the same shipping condition. 
  Sheets and bands with a textured surface and decorative 
pattern are produced at specialty metallurgy plants, and 
production of thin aluminum bands with embossed relief for new 
structures of refrigerator and conditioner evaporators has been 
assimilated. Sheets with an isotropic surface roughness are 
being produced in order to improve the stamping ability and 
adhesion resistance as well as to upgrade the outside appearance 
of paint and varnish coats (primarily in the automotive 
industry). 
  In the 1970s, sheet rolling production at the Samara 
metallurgical plant was radically restructured. By upgrading the 
hot rolling mill and installing two imported high-speed cold 
rolling mills as well as a continuous heat treatment production 
line, the capacity of the rolling shop producing sheets and 
slabs from aluminum alloys increased by 2.5 times. During the 
overhaul, large-scale production of anodized tin can band was 
set up for the first time in our country. 
  Subsequent upgrading of the seven-stand hot rolling mill 
2800 
in the 1980s made it possible to increase the hot rolled coil 
mass from 6 to 10 t and reduce the semifinished rolled stock 
thickness from 6 to 3 mm, thus making it possible to increase 
the productivity of modern high-speed cold rolling mills 1800 
and 2300 and improve the rolled stock precision. 
  Today, a sheet rolling complex on the basis of a modern 
8-stand hot rolling mill is being assembled at the Krasnoyarsk 
metallurgical plant. The specialized equipment complex makes it 
possible to produce large slabs from aluminum alloys with a 
width of up to 2.7 and a length of up to 30 m. A unique 
hardening unit with controlled jet cooling produced by the Ebner 
Company ensures a high quality of slab and plate heat treatment. 
  Production of laminated sheets and slabs (including those 
from dissimilar materials) as well as rolled-welded panels from 
aluminum alloys has been set up at Russia's plants. The use of 
laminated rolled stock in various fields of mechanical 
engineering (in aerospace technology, shipbuilding, and rocket 
building) makes it possible to use principally new structural 
designs, lower the aircraft and spacecraft mass, increase the 
service life characteristics, and save scarce materials. 
  Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with stainless steel 
have been successfully used both as structural materials for 
making vacuum-tight adaptors for welding products consisting of 
dissimilar materials, for making containers and vessels intended 
for storing corrosive liquids and biological products in 
agriculture, and for producing clad metal kitchen utensils. 
  Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with copper on one or 
both sides are used for making current conducting electrical 
equipment, current leads, contactors, and circuit breakers, and 
repeater and radar systems; in household appliances, this 
ensures a high operating reliability and saves scarce copper. 
  Rolled welded panels and thermal plates from aluminum and 
its 
alloys are used in heat exchange systems for developing 
household refrigerators, heat and pressure chambers, and life 
support systems and for making solar water heaters. 
  One hundred and eighty extrusion complexes and production 
lines on the basis of horizontal hydraulic presses with a force 
from 5 to 200 MN are in operation in rolling mills of specialty 
metallurgy plants. They are used to produce more than 20,000 
types of sections from aluminum alloys. 
  Commercial production of thin-walled panels with a 960-2,100 
mm width and an up to 12 m length from aluminum (including 
aluminum-lithium) alloys on the basis of presses with a force of 
50-80-120 and 200 MN has been underway for 25 years. This unique 
technology is based on extruding finned pipe and subsequently 
uncoiling it into a plane on special dressing equipment. 
  The domestic industry is producing hot-extruded, 
cold-strained, and welded pipes. In addition to making regular 
round pipes, finned, rectangular, and oval-shaped pipes are also 
produced. A method has been developed and specialized production 
line equipment for making drilling pipes has been manufactured. 
  In recent years, highly efficient methods of producing 
seamless tubes from aluminum alloys with an inside 
corrosion-resistant coating has been developed in Russia in 
recent years. Methods of making wound grain storage structures 
have been developed. 
  Large-size stamped blanks (with a broad assortment) from 
aluminum alloys are produced in vertical hydraulic stamping 
presses with a force from 50 to 750 MN. Spars, beams, arm props, 
chassis frames, etc., are being produced with a minimum 
machining allowance. 
  Rolled large-size rings should be mentioned among large-size 
semifinished products. 
  A technology of stamping piston-type parts from alloy AK12D 
containing 12-14% Si has been developed at specialty 
metallurgy 
plants. Full-scale tests demonstrate that their wear resistance 
increased by fivefold while their service life was extended by 
approximately twofold. 
  Such branches as the aviation industry, shipbuilding, 
general 
mechanical engineering, chemical and petroleum machinebuilding, 
and metallurgy have a need for titanium rolled stock. 
  Russia's titanium production set up at the VSMPO possesses 
the largest smelting capacities in the world for making ingots. 
With respect to the equipment range and capabilities and ingot 
production, the smelting industry exceeds all other countries 
taken together (120,000 t/yr). Cylindrical ingots with a 
280-1,200 mm diameter and an up to 15 t mass are smelted. Double 
and triple vacuum arc remelting technologies have been 
implemented in production thus ensuring a high metal quality. 
The autocrucible melting process which ensures chemical 
homogeneity of titanium alloys and the possibility of utilizing 
(up to 100%) waste and returning it back to the melt 
without 
preliminary grinding has been commercially implemented at the 
VSMPO. 
  Existing production of deformed semifinished products from 
titanium and its alloys carried out at the VSMPO, VILS, KMPP, 
ChMZ, SMK, and other enterprises ensures a diverse assortment of 
semifinished products from a wide range of alloys. 
  Methods of extruding titanium alloys and steels which 
provided for overhauling existing hydraulic presses, heating 
devices, and straightening tensile machines which have been used 
before for making aluminum alloy sections was developed in the 
mid-1960s for ensuring production of sections for engine frames. 
  Production of thin-walled sections with a minimum 1.5 mm 
wall 
thickness and with a surface quality which made it possible to 
weld them without additional machining was set up in the early 
70s. A coil method of making 0.2-0.8 mm thick sheets from 
titanium alloys with a mass of 2 t has been mastered at the 
VSMPO. 
  Due to the breakup of the USSR, Russia, being a dominant 
consumer of titanium and its alloys, was left without its own 
operating sources of titanium ore raw material or existing 
production of alloying composition and has only a 40-45% 
(of 
the demand) capacity for titanium sponge production. 
  In the near future, the issues of supplying Russia's 
titanium 
industry with its own raw material, improving the rolled stock 
and blank quality to the level of world standards, creating 
conditions for more economic metal utilization at all process 
stages, supplying all branches of the national economy with the 
full range of semifinished products and blanks, and ensuring 
access to the world market for Russia's titanium production must 
be solved comprehensively in the near future. 
  The scientists working in specialty metallurgy mastered for 
the first time in the 1960s vacuum arc melting of refractory 
nickel alloys which subsequently was implemented at all ferrous 
metallurgy plants. This made it possible considerably to improve 
the metal purity. Extensive research into using electron beam 
smelting has been carried out in order to improve the refractory 
alloy ingot quality further. Work is underway on manufacturing 
equipment and developing methods of continuous ingot casting 
using intermediate foundry ladles and separating the metal 
melting and solidification processes. 
  Yet nickel alloy blanks produced by traditional methods no 
longer meet the increasing requirements of high-temperature 
strength. Granular metallurgy which was borne at the VILS in the 
1970s made it possible to ensure the properties of compact 
blanks at the level of deformed metal properties or better and 
thus eliminate deformation in a number of cases and produce 
blanks with a high shape complexity and dimensional accuracy, 
ensure a radical improvement in properties, and manufacture 
principally new types of blanks (with a variable chemical 
composition) and combined parts (discs with blades, impellers, 
etc.) whose production is impossible by traditional metallurgy 
methods. 
  Various types of specialized domestic equipment have been 
developed for producing granules by the centrifugal electrode 
sputtering methods and their processing and degassing, as well 
as gasostats and equipment for subsequent processing and 
monitoring of ready parts. A shop for producing granular 
metallurgy products from refractory nickel alloys, particularly 
discs and shafts for mass-produced aviation engines, has been 
constructed and brought onstream. The RD-33 for MIG-29s are 
equipped with discs and shafts produced by granular metallurgy 
methods. Today, increasing the reliability of discs for modern 
turbojet engines PS-90 and TV7-117 and passenger airliners 
IL-96- 300, TU-204, and IL-114 is a high-priority task. 
  Development of modern aviation and specialty equipment calls 
for creating new materials with a low density which have high 
service characteristics. Traditional foundry and powder 
metallurgy methods have virtually exhausted their capabilities 
of increasing the properties of materials. In recent years, 
extensive developments of materials using a principally new 
method-- mechanical alloying--which differs in that all alloy 
formation processes occur in the solid phase have been underway 
at the VILS in recent years. This makes it possible to produce 
materials with a unique combination of physical and mechanical 
properties which are unattainable by other methods. 
  Assimilation of high-modulus aluminum-based materials for 
instruments and their components whose use will make it possible 
to lower the instrument mass by two- to fivefold and increase 
the instrument reliability and accuracy and high-temperature and 
heat resistance iron and nickel alloys for combustion chambers, 
heat protection screens, nozzles, heat exchangers for high- 
temperature structural fastening elements, etc., is underway. 
This will make it possible to increase the operating temperature 
of gas turbine engines by 100-150ÎC made from age-hardened 
titanium alloys with an elevated wear resistance. Materials on 
the basis of intermetallic compounds with a reduced density and 
elevated corrosion resistance are being developed for 
substituting high-temperature nickel alloys in making gas 
turbine engine blades. 
  In recent years, work has been underway on producing new 
alloys by utilizing the vacuum deposition processes. The 
possibility of producing aluminum alloys with an elevated 
high-temperature strength for use in structural elements in 
place of titanium alloys and steels is confirmed. 
  Composite materials with a metallic and ceramic matrix have 
been generating considerable interest. Aluminum composite 
materials with a discrete reinforcing agent are promising for 
ensuring a low part mass combined with a high strength and 
rigidity and good wear resistance. Thus, the specific rigidity 
of Al-SiC materials is 1.5-2 times higher than that of 
conventional structural alloys (steel and titanium and aluminum 
alloys) while their specific strength is comparable to that of 
titanium alloys and considerably exceeds high-strength steels. 
  The solution to the problem of producing materials ensuring 
operation of structures at a 1,500-1,800ÎC is closely 
related to utilizing composites with a ceramic or intermetallic 
matrix. Composites on the basis of silicon nitride and carbide 
which are characterized in that they combine high strength and 
heat conductivity with low specific gravity and coefficient of 
thermal expansion are the most promising. The use of hot 
isostatic pressing makes it possible to produce highly dense 
blanks with a complex shape with a small finishing machining 
allowance and with isotropic physical and chemical properties. 
  The accumulated experience of producing metallurgical 
semifinished products for the defense complex must be actively 
implemented under today's conditions for producing civilian 
items. It is necessary to maintain the scientific and technical 
potential of specialty metallurgy, support and promote 
scientific developments, and lay the foundation for stable 
performance of the industry in an environmental of world market 
competition. 
  Due to a reform of economic management methods in Russia 
under today's conditions and the need to merge with the 
economies of the world community, there is an urgent issue of 
ensuring that the metallurgical enterprises manufacture 
competitive products which meet customer requirements. An 
infrastructure for testing and certifying semifinished made from 
light and specialty alloys in conformance with series 9000 ISO 
international standard requirements must be developed for 
ensuring the high competitiveness of the metallurgical products. 
Setting up certification efforts will enable the metallurgical 
plants to ensure high-quality product shipments to domestic 
plants and earn a reputation of suppliers of high-quality 
products among foreign partners.

All-Russia Light Alloys Institute; UDC 69.717] 
  [Text] Compared to iron, steel, copper, brass, wood, and 
glass, aluminum as a structural material is relatively young 
since it has been produced for a little over 100 years. Yet 
nevertheless, due to the considerable diversity of its 
properties, aluminum now substitutes these materials and even 
has certain advantages over them. No other material is known 
which would be represented in such diverse forms, e.g., sheet 
and plate rolled stock, plates (slabs), foil (with a thickness 
up to 5Êm, sections, forged products, shaped cast products, 
wire, and powder. 
  A unique combination of the most diverse aluminum properties 
makes it possible to use it efficiently in various branches of 
the national economy, primarily such large sectors as the 
automotive engineering industry, construction, container and 
packaging production, electrical engineering, agriculture, etc. 
  Noticeable successes in the development of materials, 
practices, and structures and their optimum utilization have 
been achieved in these particular applications. Let us consider 
several examples. 
  The most important issue for Russia is to solve the food 
problem, primarily the tasks of harvesting, storing, and 
transporting grain since its poor organization leads to losses 
of up to 30% or more. The solution used widely in world 
practices is to develop a system of metallic mechanized grain 
storage facilities which can be rapidly erected and positioned 
in direct proximity to the food production locations. The 
construction cycle of one elevator tower with a 250 t capacity 
in the field is 24 h while a "turnkey" mechanized complex with a 
1,000 t capacity can be completed in 30 days. 
  A structure has been set up which will make it possible 
annually to construct in Russia storage facilities for 2 million 
tons of grain. This will require 25,000 t of aluminum rolled 
products. 
  A large number of other efficient aluminum building 
structures for agricultural purposes which are characterized by 
a high degree of plant finish (chicken coops, greenhouses, 
potato storage, irrigation pipes for irrigated farming, etc.) as 
well as agricultural transport structures (refrigerators, truck 
trays for transporting fertilizer, milk tanks, etc.) has been 
developed. 
  The development of production of canning band as an integral 
component of a complex of efforts aimed to set up production of 
rolled sheets was a considerable achievement. Scientific 
principles and production methods have been developed and a 
large volume of design efforts has been carried out; large-scale 
production with a capacity of up to 75,000 t/yr of band has been 
set up at the SaMZ; together with the Dmitrov pilot plant, it 
produces approximately 90,000 t/yr which amounts to 30% of 
container production in the country. Yet, e.g., compared to the 
United States, per capita consumption of aluminum rolled 
products for packaging food is 15 times lower. 
  Another promising application of aluminum is in light motor 
transport (safety beams from aluminum sections with a high 
damping ability and even entire bodies including the reinforcing 
elements and the skin, pistons for highly stressed sports car 
engines from gasostat-treated powder alloys, and reliable 
superlight stamped wheel discs manufactured by aviation 
engineering methods). 
  Aluminum consumption in Russia's motor transport may reach 
300,000 t/yr. The energy outlays for the production of aluminum 
used will be quickly recovered due to fuel savings. 
  Aluminum has found successful applications in making 
railroad 
car axle boxes because of its ability to decrease their mass by 
twofold and lower the dynamic loads on the rails and car 
structures by 10% due to aluminum's damping properties. 
Furthermore, aluminum journal boxes require virtually no repairs 
during their entire service life. Up to 8,000 t of aluminum have 
been used annually for making the axle boxes since 1982. 
  Today, conversion made it possible to utilize in car 
structures large-size panels from aluminum alloys with an up to 
800 mm width and a length equal to that of the entire car, 
aluminum alloy pipes with inside corrosion-resistant cladding 
for water supply and heating systems, and slabs from weldable 
alloys for making railroad tank cars for acids. 
  The development of both today's comfortable high-speed 
railroad cars and subway cars would be impossible without 
extensive utilization of aluminum. 
  In recent decades, aluminum has been widely used in 
construction both as load carrying and barrier structures in the 
building interior and exterior. 
  Our designers and researchers have developed not only 
barrier 
structures but also three-dimensional load-carrying structures 
of building spans spanning 18, 21, and 84 m. 
  With respect to the foregoing, we should mention that a 
completely abnormal situation has developed in the country in 
the field of structural aluminum section production, primarily 
for making building structures. The ratio of extruded products 
to the total volume of commercial rolled stock from aluminum 
alloys has remained virtually unchanged in the past decade and 
amounts to close to 12%. Generally, the ratio of aluminum 
use 
in construction in the most developed countries, such as Japan, 
has settled at a 30% level, in Italy, at approximately 
20%, 
whereas in Russia, no more than 7% of all aluminum rolled 
products made is used in construction. 
  All of the roughly 120,000 t of section production is 
concentrated at six large aviation metallurgy plants and five 
specialized plants where two-to-five presses are in operation. 
Altogether, there are approximately 140 press production lines 
and complexes in the country, including 112 in aviation 
metallurgy. At the same time, approximately 1 million tons of 
sections in the United States is produced at 250 small 
specialized plants utilizing 450 press units. 
  The need to develop in the next 10-15 years a network of 
small plants producing aluminum sections at a rate of only 
200-250,000 t/yr and putting in operation a minimum of 50-60 
modern press production lines is obvious. In order to support 
the aforementioned billet production with the requisite metal 
quality, it is necessary to set up ingot smelting at primary 
aluminum plants, i.e., columns with a 130-250 mm diameter from 
alloys 6005, 6060, and 6063 with proper filtering, inoculation, 
and diffusion annealing. 
  Recently, the issue of broader utilization of aluminum in 
the 
petroleum and gas complex has been raised at an increasing 
frequency. We have developed considerable pipe production both 
for exploration and commercial drilling. Nineteen thousand tons 
of these pipes are being produced. 
  Due to the high sulfide compound concentration in petroleum 
in Orenburg area wells, steel pipes with double thick walls have 
been used, yet this does not solve the problem since the pipes 
have to be changed anyway as corrosion progresses. At the same 
time, aluminum is resistant in a hydrogen sulfide medium and can 
compete in resistance with corrosion-resistant steel. The demand 
for petroleum and pumping and compressor pipes from aluminum 
alloys is estimated as 100,000 t/yr. 
  One can cite numerous other positive examples of aluminum 
applications in various types of equipment, processes, 
structures, and devices. 
  The high technical and economic efficiency of aluminum 
applications in various fields of engineering and 
investment-financed projects for developing primary metal and 
rolled stock production gave the users a reason to plan for a 
long- term expansion of its application volumes to up to 4.5 
million t/yr (1978 and 1983 forecasts). 
  A reduction in project financing volumes, the absence of a 
noticeable increase in primary aluminum production and, 
likewise, aluminum rolled products and its constant shortages, 
and allocation of rolled stock for individual applications based 
on the residual principle led to a decrease in the user 
"appetite" and, most importantly, pushed the time of planned 
increase in aluminum use to 2005 and 2010. We should also notice 
that the forecast was made based on 1989 orders, i.e., prior to 
the start of an escalating price increase for metals, energy, 
and other types of resources. 
  In real life, a drop in rolled stock production volume has 
been observed in the last three years. The reasons for this 
phenomenon are dual in origin. On the one hand, the principal 
management difficulties causing unstable plant operation are due 
to the lack of raw material supplies and disruption of economic 
relations. 



  On the other hand, the consumers are moving away from using 
rolled stock, do not accept products already made to order, and 
return to old technologies and structures employing steel, cast 
iron, and other less expensive materials due to a sharp rise in 
aluminum rolled stock prices (Fig. 1) brought about by a 
multiple increase in prices for primary metals, energy, and 
other resources. In particular, such automotive enterprises as 
the KamAZ, MAZ, and OdAZ have ceased ordering extruded sections 
in the last two years while railroad workers are quickly 
restarting production of railroad car axle boxes from steel and 
pig iron. 



  If we compare thealuminum rolled product price index to that 
of steel, wood, or cement (Fig. 2), i.e., the materials which it 
effectively substitutes, one can see its considerable lead. For 
this reason, in the past two to three years, aluminum has 
catastrophically lost its position gained in previous years. 
  Process engineers, naturally, possess the reserves whose 
utilization will make it possible to decrease to a certain 
extent the rate of price increase for aluminum rolled stock; 
this is primarily a decrease in the energy outlays for its 
production. Enterprises of the former aviation metallurgy are 
heavy users of fuel and energy resources. In 1991, they consumed 
4 billion kWh of electric power, more than 1 billion 
m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas, and 13 million GJ of thermal 
energy. 
  The energy source price rise led to an increase in the ratio 
of energy outlays to the cost of production from 2.5 to 
10% 
while a further rise in the energy source price to the world 
level may boost the energy component of production costs to 
20%. Under such conditions, the role of energy 
conservation in 
the economic subenterprises changes radically. The reserves of 
energy resource conservation at enterprises are estimated to be 
at least 30%. Most of the largest operating energy 
consuming 
equipment is obsolete and has been greatly neglected while the 
energy consumption management level lags behind today's 
computerized planning and equipment operation control practices. 
  It is necessary to develop new combustion melting furnaces 
with a modern regenerative burner system and a high-speed flame 
and an automatic control system. 
  Utmost utilization of liquid aluminum from electrolyzers in 
smelting ingots in Krasnoyarsk and Kamensk-Uralsk may greatly 
lower energy outlays (up to 100 million rubles/yr). The 
power-to-output ratio for producing tin can band by using 
non-ingot blank rolling can be lowered by 25-30%. 
  The following should be substituted: obsolete traveling 
ovens 
for heating slabs--with modern pusher-tube furnaces at the 
Kamensk-Uralsk and Belaya Kalitva Metallurgical Production 
Associations and the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works; 
the uneconomical and environmentally unacceptable saltpeter 
quenching baths at the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works 
and Kamensk- Uralsk Metallurgical Production Association; and 
resistance furnaces--with gas-fired furnaces. 
  Due to the insufficient present level of investment, the use 
of secondary energy resources (VER) does not exceed 4% of 
the 
total output. Yet an increase in the secondary energy resource 
utilization by a mere 10% may lower the energy outlays by 
120 
million rubles/yr. 
  Another important reserve which is not adequately used today 
and which makes it possible under rising primary metal and 
energy resource prices to improve the situation with the use of 
aluminum in various industries is maximizing the involvement of 
secondary aluminum in production. In contrast to many other 
metals, the very nature of aluminum provides broad opportunities 
for its multiple use. Moreover, the energy outlays for its 
production amount to merely 5% of the primary production 
energy 
outlays. 
  Thus far, a lion's share of annually produced aluminum has 
been irretrievably lost from circulation and will not be 
returned in the form of recycled scrap until the end of the 
products' service life. The ratio of secondary aluminum to the 
total volume of its production in the country does not exceed 
18-20% while the rolled stock produced from secondary 
aluminum 
alloys amounts to merely 5% of the total volume. At the 
same 
time, the proportion of secondary aluminum in world practices 
reaches close to 25% (close to 38% in the United 
States and 
30% in Europe) and in individual developed countries, it 
exceeds 75% (79.1% in Japan in 1985). 
  The mining and alumina enterprises and primary aluminum 
production plants also have sufficient reserves and are faced 
with problems whose realization and solution may have a 
beneficial effect on increasing the technical level and lowering 
the cost of their production. 
  Yet when each enterprise individually addresses the 
aforementioned issues, both extracting and processing, most of 
the efficient large-scale measures cannot be implemented because 
they require considerable investment which an individual 
enterprise cannot afford. 
  At the same time, historically the aluminum-containing raw 
material mining (bauxites and nephelines) and alumina and 
primary aluminum production have been exclusively concentrated 
in nonferrous metallurgy while production of structural rolled 
stock from aluminum and its alloys (plates, sheets, bands, 
sections, panels, buses, rods, pipes, wire, stampings, and 
rings)--primarily at machining enterprises of the former USSR 
Ministry of Aviation Industry. 
  Thus, the issue of supplying the needs of the national 
economy with aluminum products has been thus far addressed by a 
large number of individual uncoordinated enterprises. 
  The three most important features can be identified among 
the 
many negative consequences of such lack of coordination. 

  -  Due to a rather frequent discrepancy between the 
departmental interests and natioal interests, the issue of 
stably supplying metalworking enterprises with primary metal has 
always been solved with great difficulties. As a result, the 
degree to which the national economy's need for aluminum rolled 
products are met has not exceeded 75-80%. 
  -  Under the conditions where state subsidies are severely 
limited 
and, at times, are not available altogether, and it is 
impossible to concentrate the financial resources for radically 
increasing the technical production level, each individual 
enterprise, as we have already indicated, is forced to limit its 
retooling plans in accordance with its own realistic 
possibilities. 
  -  Given the existing tax structure, only the added-value tax 
collected more than once due to the lack of enterprise 
coordination leads to a sharp increase in the aluminum rolled 
stock cost, a drop in demand, and a loss of positions already 
gained. 
  -  In our opinion, under today's conditions, these problems can 
be 
solved radically by deepening the vertical links and setting up 
unified commercial structures for manufacturing aluminum 
products, the so-called technological aluminum corporations. 
They are technological because they must unify enterprises which 
have long been connected by a common technological link which 
includes mining the ore raw material, processing it, producing 
primary metal, and manufacturing ready metallurgical production 
(rolled stock). 

    Prompt resolution of the issue of eliminating the 
bottlenecks, bringing the entire technological cycle to a proper 
technical level, ensuring stable operation of all links, and 
attaining high economic production indicators and total economic 
independence is possible only in the framework of sufficiently 
strong commercial structures and by concentrating intellectual, 
financial, and other sources.

<F P=106> [Article by V. A. Titkov, Scientific and Technical Institute </F>
of Interbranch Information, Ministry of Science of Russia] 
  [Excerpts] The developed countries of the world are 
presently involved in the global exchange of materials, 
information, and specialists. The direction of the flow of high 
technology is decisive in this process. Theoretically, one can 
quantitatively measure the volume of these exchanges across 
national borders; however, practically speaking, the scale of 
the transmission of high technology in three such streams can be 
determined only qualitatively. For example, the influx of high 
technology from the West into Japan greatly exceeds the influx 
from Japan to the West, judging from some unsystematic data, for 
example, statistics on Japanese students and graduate students 
studying in the US and Europe or the exchange of scientists. 
  In essence, today's high technology is global, and one 
cannot 
avoid the aforementioned contacts. Especially interesting is the 
problem of systemization, classification, and analysis of the 
number and quality of specialists in high technology, the 
"generators" and bearers of this technology. 
  The success of Japan in developing high technology areas of 
industry and science, as well as the active positive role of the 
government in this process, have made Japan's experience 
important for the reform of science and industry in Russia. 
Thus, it is especially interesting to study Japanese specialists 
in high technology areas (primarily microelectronics, computing, 
etc.) as well as the scientists who provide for the development 
of these fields. An instrument, and at the same time, an object 
of study is the NAMES database, which includes the leading 
Japanese scientists, businessmen, and specialists in high 
technology. 
  The objects of study were: 1. analysis of the sources of 
information; 2. the method of selecting specialists for 
inclusion in the database; and 3. a quantitative estimate of the 
level of competence of the specialists (optimal number of 
parameters characterizing a specialist, elimination of the 
subjectivity of expert opinions, etc.). 
  [passage omitted] 
<H3>  Description of the NAMES database (``Who's who in the high 
technology of Japan'') </H3>
  The NAMES database is an automated information research 
system which includes a card file and specialized software based 
on the dBASE IV database management system with a list of 
classification headings. The database includes about 5000 names 
of Japanese scientists, engineers, and managers working in high 
technology fields such as computing, microelectronics, automated 
design and production, robotics, etc. A record in the database 
includes personal parameters (full name, presence or absence of 
name written in Japanese characters, address of employing 
organization, telephone, fax, etc.) as well as professional 
parameters (degree/title, post, area of scientific interests, 
patents, etc.). In addition to these fields there is also a text 
field for additional information. 
  A program module has been developed to calculate a 
generalized estimate of the level of competence, for which a 
special field is reserved. 
  Information in the card file has been collected since about 
1975. 
  In the future, NAMES will have a modular structure including 
thematic files (computers, semiconductors, robots, etc.), a 
patent file (patent abstracts, patent holders included in the 
database), a statistical module, and possibly an organizational 
file on the structure of organizations whose employees are 
included in the database. The database language is English, 
because the product is primarily oriented toward a Western 
market. Of course, as the situation in Russia improves it will 
be easy to adapt the database to the domestic market. 
  Specialists in the database may be grouped by firm, 
government scientific research institute, governmental 
department, professional society, association, or corporations 
of Japan. 
  At present the database does not require a knowledge of 
programming and enables one to work in the following modes: 
query by example, editing of records, editing of the screen, 
addition of new records, and printing of the current record. In 
query mode one can search the following fields in the record: 
name, organization, area of scientific interests, degree/title, 
and patents. 
  Additional database capabilities enable the user to join and 
sort data in different ways, to verify information, to organize 
interactive work modes, and to protect in formation. 
<H5>  Prospects for further development </H5>
  The world is involved in a constant battle for the 
possession 
of intellect and access to its sources. A consequence is a 
continuing migration of intellect across national borders, and 
this requires a practical estimate of the potential of the 
scientists and specialists of various countries. Here a database 
of the scientists and specialists of various countries can play 
an irreplaceable role. Such databases make it possible, with the 
appropriate depth of development and entries, to determine the 
number and level of competence of specialists in various fields 
of science and technology and detect trends and features of 
development, priorities, and goals in the scientific and 
technical progress of various countries. 
  Our NAMES database may be used as a prototype database for 
various countries, and is a useful instrument for researchers 
and private companies. It is also a methodological basis for the 
creation of similar database. Such databases have good 
commercial prospects, because the participation of high 
technology specialists is key in determining the success or 
failure of new firms. 
  In the Russian Academy of Sciences and in industry there are 
specialists from the countries of the Far East and Southeast 
Asia who may be drawn to the development of such databases, 
which would make it possible to solve another problem, that of 
the optimal use of scientists and specialists in our country. 
  We can use the existing methodological and factographic 
materials right now and fill the niche in the Western 
information market for a database of personal information on 
Japanese specialists in the area of high technology. According 
to our estimates this niche will remain empty for a maximum of 
2-3 years. The market for a database on Japanese specialists in 
areas of high technology in industry and science may attract 
thousands, even tens of thousands of users and may constitute a 
sum of several million dollars. 
  Our plan, given minimum financing, is to develop a 
full-scale 
relational database of personal information, programs for 
statistical analysis and quantitative evaluation of the level of 
competence of the specialist in interactive mode, independent of 
the contents of the database, as well as active sounding of the 
Western information market with advertisements and the formation 
of demand for such software products.

  [Text] Strictly speaking, Samorukov's area of 
responsibility at the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is 
supercomputer components. But who works strictly according to 
job description? Samorukov is also involved in LSI design and 
development and in the automation of LSI design. In other words, 
as Samorukov says, he takes what the logicians and experts in 
computer structure and architecture have developed, combines it, 
and pulls it through the physical implementation stage in such a 
way that the final prototype machine will operate reliably. 
  [Samorukov] The point is that in specifying the 
limiting characteristics of our computers, all these specialists 
frequently forget to take into account the fact that Kvant is 
not independently capable of implementing their designs in 
hardware using existing components. We have therefore been 
forced to approach collaborating enterprises in the electronics 
industry and order new components from them; otherwise, we could 
only dream of reaching the required level. However, these 
collaborators have their own requirements: We must not only 
develop a concept for a new machine and determine its 
characteristics, not only develop plans for it, but also put all 
of the ideas in a document of specific form; this document is 
then provided to the designers of the various individual 
units---to designers specializing in electric power, automation, 
etc. One person needs to be able to keep track of all this in 
his head. I am that person. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Is there any difference between 
what you worried about 10 or 15 years ago and what you worry 
about now? 
  [Samorukov] The situation is quite different now. 
Before, under strict centralized government control, Kvant and 
its products had high priority. We had both money and confirming 
directives---in essence, guarantees. We took these directives 
and hired collaborating enterprises. And we knew that this 
product would come in from this enterprise and that product 
would come in from that enterprise in accordance with 
established deadlines, so that we could count on being able to 
construct a new machine within the required time frame according 
to plan, debug it, build a mockup, and present it to the 
customer. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Weren't there failures under 
this system? 
  [Samorukov] Of course there were. Supplies were 
occasionally interrupted and development sometimes slowed down, 
but the system generally functioned. It enabled both us and our 
suppliers to plan. The customers had well-defined benchmarks 
good to plus or minus six months or a year. It was possible to 
project 5-10 years ahead with reasonable confidence. 
  The main customer for our high-production items has been the 
defense industry. And as soon as they began to have their 
budgets cut and started cutting back, the orders immediately 
stopped coming in, which left the Kvant Scientific Research 
Institute with much less financial maneuvering room. After all, 
the need for the equipment we produced was much smaller. 
Moreover, the flexibility of Kvant's supercomputer technology 
enables us to include 100 or even 1000 units in a single 
machine, while a commercial customer might be satisfied with a 
power of 10 or 20. It turns out that we are now working (to put 
it mildly) at far less than our full potential. Most 
``free-market'' entities are simply not in a position to use our 
class of technology or components. This leads to wheel-spinning 
and downtime. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Dead season? 
  [Samorukov] Half-dead. It is now clear that 
without government support, ``high technology'' enterprises such 
as ours previously oriented towards defense work will soon 
experience difficulties. And this is despite the fact that many 
problems in pure science requiring high-performance computers 
(such as meteorological forecasting and seismic research) are 
still of current interest and remain unsolved. There is 
virtually no government support. The US itself, with its 
extremely well-developed commercial sector which has trillions 
of dollars available to it, has traditional government 
investment in supercomputer programs, and the sums involved are 
enormous: Last year, in 1992, the American government subsidized 
a supercomputer and communications technology development 
program with 600 million dollars. This is equivalent to 600 
billion rubles. But our government has cast Kvant to the winds 
of fate and put us out to pasture to sink or swim. That's why 
we're going after any development projects at all, generally 
small projects completely inconsistent with the level of 
problems that the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is capable 
of working on. But what can we do? We are trying to keep our 
unique corps of specialists together and prevent them from 
running off to commercial or other enterprises capable of paying 
higher salaries than Kvant. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] And are you succeeding? 
  [Samorukov] Yes, with difficulty. Many of the 
young people we had the most hope in have either already left or 
are thinking of leaving. We are only able to hold on to the 
older staff. After all, we stall have a budgetary limit on 
salaries. We even have to state this in [employment] agreements. 
Only very recently have we been able to talk about indexing 
salaries or graduated financing. To put it another way, it is 
completely impossible for us to provide our staff with the same 
standard of living that we could about ten years ago. The 
problem of how to keep the Kvant staff in some sort of suspended 
animation until our products are indeed needed by the country as 
a whole (and not just a limited segment) will therefore be 
difficult to solve. Moreover, we are now unable to invest in 
development as we have for many years. All of the money received 
by the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is now being eaten.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Reznikov. First paragraph is NOVAYA </F>
YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA introduction.] 
  [Text] Computer piracy in Russia is a widespread 
phenomenon. The world average ratio of stolen (that is, 
illegally copied) to purchased software is about 1:3; in Russia 
it is 999:1. 
  Russia is computerizing rapidly. No self-respecting firm can 
do without a computer, and frequently blue monitor screens glow 
even in the windows of private residences. But virtually every 
common citizen, knowing how expensive the computer itself is, 
perceives computer programs as some sort of free supplement to 
the machine itself, as if they were empty diskettes. There are 
few who realize that computer programs frequently cost much more 
than the computers themselves. 
  All Russians, whom fate has somehow granted a computer, are 
in one way or another connected with the main global computer 
problem of piracy (or, scientifically speaking, bootlegging). 
Almost all software products used today in Russia are stolen, 
that is, not purchased from an official dealer of the producer, 
or copied without the producer's knowledge and consent. Every 
year, computer firms suffer multimillion, even billion dollar 
losses from illegal copying. The majority of Russians who are 
associated in one way or another with computer equipment engage 
continuously in piracy. Don't put on a concerned face...it's you 
too. Turn on your computer and look at the hard disk directory: 
did you buy many of the programs there officially? Or for 
example, yesterday you presented your friend with a diskette 
with the latest Aidstest; did you pay for it, or did you copy 
it yourself? It's not even important that you didn't profit from 
this. Piracy is any use of one copy of purchased software by 
more than one user simultaneously. In civilized countries this 
is a crime with a rather severe punishment. We have these laws 
too, but they are universally ignored, because the process is 
uncontrollable. 
  You must understand that I'm not complaining a lot about 
this 
yet. World prices for software are intended for the world, and 
not for us. Although prices are still somewhat lower here, not 
everyone can bring himself to pay the equivalent of 400 dollars 
for the latest version of Corel Draw when he can simply get it 
from his friends. Thus, the real prohibition of computer piracy 
will be equivalent to prohibiting computers in general, and this 
means our hopelessly lagging country will again have to go back 
to the drawing board. 
  Despite the fact that Russia is firmly in first place in the 
world in the number of illegal copies and the ratio of stolen to 
purchased software, we are still far from understanding what 
true piracy is. We are as far from it as the pirates of the 
eighteenth century are from today's pirates. Today there are 
entire pirate companies with the same scope as computer 
companies, but which do not advertise. They fill the market with 
their products, which have a quality approaching the quality of 
the true product. The bootlegs (illegal copies) are sold in 
large software stores, in packaging with documentation, in a 
completely official-looking form. These companies are mainly in 
the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe, which now seem 
to specialize in the production of illegal goods, from imitation 
``German'' liquors to, as you can see, computer programs. 
However, these firms also exist in the West. For example, 
recently, illegal copies of a remarkable game, Formula One Grand 
Prix, and Oxford Chess by MicroProse were demonstrated to me. 
They had been brought from England and everything was in order, 
from the ``official'' diskettes to the documentation... 
  These programs are mainly bought by our countrymen because, 
first, they are cheaper than the r eal thing, and second, 
because few Russians have seen the original packaging of the 
computer game. To those people who want to know how to 
differentiate bootlegs from originals, I advise them to take a 
look: 1. originals always have a colorful box; copies are sold 
in cellophane packets. 2. In the documentation usually the 
illegal books have colorful covers, but inside the text is a 
xerox. Virtually all true books with program documentation are 
printed in at least two colors and if the book has 
illustrations, especially photographs, they are usually color 
illustrations. 3. All diskettes should have the company logo. If 
you still decide to buy the illegal copy, I advise you to check 
it before you leave the store, because usually pirates use bad 
diskettes and half of them don't work. 
  Games comprise the majority of bootlegs. This is not 
surprising because they are the only type of software which is 
constantly updated, and for which the demand is never satiated. 
Of the serious general-purpose programs, the average person only 
needs a couple programming language compilers, one text editor, 
a couple gr aphic editors, DOS, Aidstest, and Norton. He can 
have an unlimited number of games, according to his temperament 
(I, for example, have 350.). Thus, all firms who produce games 
try to protect themselves from piracy. 
  They do this in different ways. Some simply cite the 
copyright law with the fine (in the U.S. up to a million 
dollars) and the imprisonment (up to five years) which one 
incurs for illegal copying and distribution of the product. 
Others use more effective forms of protection, for example, Doc 
check, when the program, either at the very beginning or at the 
most interesting part (if it is a game) suddenly asks one to 
open the accompanying book to some page and enter some word on 
some line of some paragraph, or some password, or a serial 
number, or to find a picture in the documentation and say what 
number it corresponds to, etc. 
  Another more cunning verification method is a disk method. 
The most primitive variety is the presence of information on the 
original diskette which is ``invisible'' to the operating system 
(and consequently to the user) which the program needs, but 
which is not copied from disk to disk. Sometimes the 
verification of placement of files on a disk is used, sometimes 
it is the presence of marked sectors on the disk. Some firms 
format their diskettes so that they are completely unsuitable 
for DOS, but the program itself can be read from it. Sometimes 
they make special key diskettes which cannot be copied and must 
be placed in the disk drive upon the request of the booted 
program. This method of protection is gradually becoming 
obsolete as it is inconvenient for users and virtually all games 
and programs today are so big that one must use a hard disk. 
  Gradually, all software producers are using a new 
information 
carrier, laser disks (CD-ROM) like those used to record music 
and films. They cannot be rewritten, large volumes of 
information can be stored on them (300-600 megabytes, more than 
the average hard disk, for example), and in general they require 
no protection. For this same reason they are not very widespread 
here. By the way, firms are actively working on the ability to 
record on laser disks. This ``problem'' will obviously be solved 
soon, so one will soon be able to copy them as easily as 
diskettes. 
  Small, relatively unknown firms have a tendency to be mean 
to 
pirates. They make their programs so that if illegal copying is 
detected, they either infect the machine with some virus or 
damage all accessible information. It's understandable: Who 
wants to lose several million dollars on pirate copies? But they 
inspire neither respect nor sympathy, but rather malice in 
return. In essence, they are not much better than virus writers 
who do great damage. By the way, these firms usually go bankrupt 
because of their malice. First, people are simply afraid of 
programs which may infect their computer (by accident, for 
example), and second, pirate copies are usually provided with 
programs with a good reputation, and everyone prefers to buy 
what he knows. 
  However, any copy protection is usually little comfort to 
the 
producer because there are always people who know how to get 
around it. They are called crackers (not to be confused with the 
food; rather, safe crackers). These people are good programmers 
who understand the workings of their computer and who have a 
good knowledge of assembler. They crack games and programs so 
that they are incapable of recognizing their illegal status, 
that is, they remove from the program the part which is 
responsible for protection. This is also an entire industry. 
There are large cracking operations involved in the commercial 
distribution of the results of their work (as a rule through 
computer networks) with branches all over the world and a large 
number of members and couriers. There are few computer people 
among us who have not heard of such organizations as the United 
Group or The Dream Team. These two pirate groups, who appeared 
in the U.S., gradually expanded to the entire globe, and now 
even have branches in Russia (and not only in Moscow and St. 
Petersburg). 
  Russia has the largest number of cracker offices and 
individual crackers, but it must be said that cracking programs 
is hack-work here. Frequently games leave the hands of our 
``experts'' in an unusable form, but one usually finds this out 
only in the middle of the game, not at the beginning. The 
crackers need only to sell the ``cracked'' program; you don't 
notice the hack-work at first glance, after which you bang your 
head against the wall. They are filling the Russian underground 
market for games with completely inoperable illegal copies. 
That's how most of the adventure games from Delphine, and the 
Formula 1 games of MicroProse, were cracked; five minutes after 
the machine starts up one loses control, and much else. Western 
crackers periodically send us petitions with a request to take 
this seriously, but they don't accomplish much. 
  The best crackers in the world also live in Russia and 
worked 
in the former KGB. Earlier, their job was to ``crack'' enemy 
information, but since there are no enemies left and they need 
money, they are not squeamish about illegal work. They crack 
only serious programs which offer a great deal of protection for 
a lot of money and by individual order. Good cracker 
organizations are mainly found in the Scandinavian countries. 
  The third branch of the unofficial computer business is 
hint-writing. Here people write hints for adventure computer 
games. Mainly, these are hints which explain what one must do to 
reach the end. Tactics are written for strategic games, and sets 
of control key combinations are written for arcade games and 
simulators. There are fewer hints for logic games. In general, 
this is not completely official and not entirely a business: 
First, firms write their own hints to their games, and hint 
writers do not recopy them, but find their own hints, which are 
not always within their jurisdiction; second, as a rule, hints 
are written without any commercial interest by people who simply 
really like the game and by writing hints can play it anew (I 
know, I have written them myself.). This process is followed by 
pirates, who resell the hints. This is the truly illegal side: 
Some people write hints using passwords (instead of how to 
``break'' the game). A somewhat gray branch of this ``document 
piracy'' is the writing of programming books. These books are 
needed only by those who stole the language they need (the 
software). Registered users have free support. 
  Finally, the fourth and most dangerous branch of the 
underground computer business is hacking-entry into all kinds of 
computer systems and cracking them ``in person.'' There are 
greater profits, greater risks, greater punishments, and 
significantly greater damage done to the victim. I hope to speak 
about this next time. 
  Overall, the illegal computer business is no less complex 
and 
no smaller than the official business. All Russians have been 
drawn to it for a long time. Even if we correct the economic 
situation, which I strongly doubt, and if every citizen has the 
opportunity to buy not only a computer, but also programs for 
it, the situation will not correct itself quickly (if it 
corrects itself at all). We have been taught materialism for so 
many years that we cannot conceive of information, a product of 
intellectual activity which should not be touched, as something 
valuable. Thus, we copy all varieties of information, from music 
to computer programs, from books to films, without thinking that 
their creation involved efforts no less than those expended in 
creating, for example, a microwave oven.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Zigunenko, TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI special </F>
correspondent. First paragraph is TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI 
introduction, a question from a student.] 
  [Text] ``In 
1990's No. 5 issue, the capabilities of supercomputers were 
described using examples of foreign supercomputers. In 1991's 
No. 1 issue the development of the Elbrus 3-1 domestic 
supercomputer, with a capability of more than a billion 
operations per second, was mentioned. It's 1993 and I'm still 
waiting for you to tell us about this computer in detail.'' 
Vladimir Sergeyev, student, Perm. 
  ``Don't describe our machine as anything special,'' they 
told 
me at the S. A. Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and 
Computing, ``there's nothing special about it.'' 
  This was a strange comment. What was behind it: exaggerated 
modesty or a judicious recognition of the significance of what 
had been done? I got the answer in the computer room where the 
Elbrus 3-1 is being checked out. 
  ``If you want to be scrupulously exact, what stands before 
us 
is not a computer, but a general-purpose multiprocessor 
computing system with well-developed software,'' stated one of 
the authors of this work, the deputy chief designer, Vladimir 
Abramovich Zhukovskiy. ``You can see the difference if you look 
at its architecture. First let's be specific: architecture in 
computing doesn't mean the metal racks and units filling the 
room. Nor does it mean the design, in terms of shape, color, 
etc. Computer architecture can only be clearly seen on a sheet 
of paper showing what's connected to what and in what sequence 
(see schematic).'' 
  The main parts of the Elbrus are the modular switching 
system, the peripheral system, the power supply system, the 
cooling system, and the general system software. 
  Communication with the machine is facilitated by automated 
digital printers, individual control panels, otherwise called 
work stations, and automated digital displays. 
  Today's communication systems make it possible to input data 
and receive the results of calculations without entering the 
computer room, either from the next room or another city. One 
can conduct not only man-machine dialogs, but machine-machine 
dialogs. With one set of adapters the Elbrus 1-5B and Elbrus-2 
representatives of the YeS family of computers can work with the 
Elbrus 3-1. 
  In general, one can increase the power of the computer 
complex, not only with external resources, that is, by attaching 
other computers, but also using the internal features of the 
Elbrus 3-1. 
  The central computer of the Elbrus 3-1 is the modular 
switching system. It, in turn, consists of modular pipeline 
processors, a bulk RAM, and the adapters which connect the 
high-speed switching network. When these adapters are used 
together, 16 modular pipeline processors can be attached, as 
well as 16 RAM units. If this is not enough to solve the 
problem, another 32 channels can be activated to connect in 
more resources, including other computers. 
  The modular pipeline processor itself is comprised of 
several 
modules, each of which executes a certain operation, addition, 
multiplication, etc. If one must first multiply the incoming 
data to solve a problem, and then add it, then the assembly line 
of modules is formed as follows: multiplier first, then summer. 
  Special modules which operate in a general pipeline mode 
make 
it possible to sharply increase speed. It is because of these 
special processors that one can calculate at such a high speed: 
from 50 million operations per second with scalar quantities to 
400 million operations per second with vector quantities. The 
modular switching system may have not one, not two, but four 
processors (in the future more will be possible), so the total 
performance of several such pipelines may reach 1.6 billion 
operations per second or more. 
  The high level of performance of the Elbrus 3-1 creates 
certain technical problems. One of them is that the computer 
heats up when it is in operation, and the excess heat may melt 
contacts, conductors, and integrated microcircuit elements, the 
very foundations upon which the computer is built. 
  The traditional solution, blowing a stream of cold air 
through the units, was ineffective in this case: one could 
create a hurricane in the computer room. Then the developers 
decided to use liquid cooling along with air cooling. 
  Abroad, this is what is frequently done: the units which 
perform the most intense work are placed in Dewar vessels, that 
is, in thermoses with liquid nitrogen or helium. The cooling is 
reliable and in some cases may even reach the superconducting 
stage, but a great deal of frost is formed. We managed to solve 
this problem using very simple measures. 
  Zhukovskiy showed me a micromodule, a plate about 3X3 cm in 
size. It had a radiator through which a cooling fluid was 
pumped. The radiator removes the excess heat from micromodules 
on a board 0.5X0.5 m in size. The fluid then enters a 
refrigerator, where the heat is removed; the fluid is then 
returned to the cooling system. 
  Boards with micromodules are placed in a frame similar to 
the 
plates of glass in a balcony door. The aluminum frame in turn is 
fastened to a column in an equipment rack. Thus, by rotating the 
door, the debuggers and operators can gain access to any unit, 
to each micromodule, even while the machine is in operation. 
This greatly simplifies and speeds up debugging and repair. 
  These are only some of the designs of the many used in the 
construction of one of the first domestic supercomputers. And 
yet, overall, the specialists are not very satisfied with their 
work. For example, abroad one chip can have millions of 
transistors, capacitors, and resistors; here in the best case, 
only hundreds of thousands are possible. The result is a great 
increase in size, mass, and energy consumption, as well as a 
reduction in performance. 
  That is why the developers don't want to say anything 
special 
about their baby: they created a computer using domestic 
micromodules which stands up to the remarkable Cray in a number 
of ways; but if it only exceeded the Cray in every way! 
  American television reporters tagging along at the institute 
held another opinion. They wanted to see with their own eyes and 
show the viewers back home one of wonders of what is to them a 
poorly understood nation. After work people stand in lines for 
increasingly expensive bread; at work they manage to reach the 
level of the world's best achievements. How do they do it? 
  Unfortunately, the answer for us is the same as in the 
famous 
Leskov story of Levsha. There is no scarcity of talent in 
Russia: when there is no magnifying glass, we just sharpen our 
eyesight...

Communications''] 
  [Text] At the center of attention of 
organizers and guests of the press conference held in February 
at the press center of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs were 
questions of satellite communications, its present and future. 
Journalists talked about this topic (heretofore largely 
``closed'' to the mass media) with the leaders of legislative 
bodies, industries, agencies and, of course, scientists whose 
efforts are largely responsible for the fame of our engineering 
work in space, including satellite communications. The reason 
for the meeting was launching of the ``Rossiya'' Program of 
Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting 
approved by our nation's government last year. 
  Speedy updating of communication facilities has recently 
come 
to be one of the main concerns of the Russian Government. It has 
become abundantly clear that without up-to-date 
telecommunications, we cannot set up an effective mechanism of 
economic reform and integrate ourselves into the international 
community. Reaching this goal over the great expanse of our 
nation is no easy matter, and therefore organization of 
communications via satellite with many remote regions is not 
only more advantageous than building relay lines or laying 
cables, but at times is the only way to get information 
``cargo'' to and from these places. Of course, this is not just 
a matter of telephone calls or data transmission, but also of 
television broadcasting of local and national programs. 
  However, as witnessed by RF Minister of Communications V. B. 
Bulgak, the current level of development of communications 
cannot be considered satisfactory. The communication satellites 
now in use were developed in the seventies, and therefore are 
not up to today's world level in throughput and performance. 
Moreover, there is a shortage not only of the satellites 
themselves, but also of ground stations, which is slowing down 
the development of communications and television broadcasting in 
many regions of the Russian ``boondocks.'' Last year, the 
fraction of satellite communication lines was only 6 percent of 
the total volume of international channels in the nation, while 
actual demand was at least 20 percent. Many reasons have been 
named for such a sad situation, among which one of the main ones 
is the disproportion evolved in the past between the number of 
military and civilian satellites. Figures have even been cited: 
to 140 of the former there have been only 36 of the latter, and 
of those 36 only 10 were designed for communications and 
broadcasting. So one of the main goals of Russian communication 
satellite doctrine is conversion of defense satellites. 
  Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to assume that mere 
launching of new satellites or defense conversion of old ones is 
a panacea. Dozens of satellites may be placed in orbit, but 
nothing would be accomplished. We need a developed reception 
network, as otherwise we will be throwing money ``into space''in 
a real sense. We must uniformly develop the satellite and ground 
segments, making a much greater investment in the latter than is 
now the case. And incidentally, even without launching new 
satellites, we could cover all of Siberia today with TV 
broadcasts; however, the ``satellite potential'' is not being 
completely used because of a lack of ground stations. 
  To correct the situation that has evolved, a Program of 
Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting has 
been approved; implementation of this Program will enable us to 
provide telephone service to inaccessible and remote regions of 
Russia, to set up new main networks, to organize mobile 
satellite communication, to considerably increase the volume of 
data transmission and the number of international channels, and 
also to provide multiple-program television broadcasting over 
the entire territory of the nation. In accordance with the 
intention of the developers of the Program (Scientific 
Production Association of Applied Mechanics, Scientific Research 
Institute of Radio, Central Scientific Research Institute of 
Communications, ``Avtomatika'' Production Association and 
``Iskra'' Production Association), the entire satellite 
communication system will consist of three subsystems: fixed 
satellite service, mobile communications, and direct television 
broadcasting. 
  Within the scope of the first subsystem, trunk and 
international communication lines will be organized, as well as 
lines of intrazonal and rural communications, business 
communications and data networks. Priority will be given to 
zonal and local communications, particularly in regions of the 
Far North, Siberia and the Far East, where communication is 
possible generally only via satellite. The subsystem of mobile 
communications will connect subscribers of mobile and remote 
facilities: ships and aircraft, railroad transport and the like 
situated not only on the territory of Russia, but also beyond 
its borders. Finally, direct television broadcasting will be the 
base for organizing universal coverage by two national TV 
programs and also local (regional) programs. 
  To handle these tasks, new advanced satellites are to be 
developed as outlined by Academician M. F. Reshetnov, general 
designer and director general of the Scientific Production 
Association of Applied Mechanics. Incidentally, not many of us 
had ever even heard of the SPA of AM. Situated in the formerly 
classified city of Krasnoyarsk-23, this enterprise for several 
decades has been the center of realization of nearly all our 
space programs, both military and civilian. But, of course, 
defense purposes predominated. The SPA of AM is now ``beating 
swords into plowshares,'' and to that end a joint-stock company 
of the same name has already been set up within the scope of the 
Association, dealing with the business of bringing life to the 
Program of development of Russian satellite communications, 
mainly on a commercial basis. 
  Work is in progress today at the SPA of AM on new 
satellites: 
``Gals,'' ``Ekspress,'' ``Arkos,'' ``Gonets,'' ``Sovkanstar'' 
and ``Mayak.'' These will not just replace their predecessors in 
orbit, but will take on some new functions as well. For example, 
the well known ``Gorizont'' satellites will be gradually 
replaced by ``Ekspress'' satellites that will begin operating 
next year. The first ``Ekspress'' will be launched this year. 
The new satellites will support transmission of television 
programs, as well as telephony signals and data. For these 
satellites, the Scientific Research Institute of Radio is 
developing new ground stations with antennas 2.5-4 m in 
diameter. And in a few years, the ``Ekspress-M'' satellite is to 
be launched, which will need a ``dish'' only 0.9-1.5 m in 
diameter for signal reception. 
  According to tentative estimates, introduction of 
``Ekspress'' satellites will quadruple or quintuple the 
throughput of the satellite communication system, and the 
lifetime of the satellite itself will be more than doubled. The 
increased throughput of the ``Ekspress'' trunks will be made 
possible by the use of new multiple access equipment with FDM 
and TDM, high-speed modems in ground stations, and the use of 
statistical multiplexing equipment in the latter. 
  Quite promising is the prospect of introducing low-orbit 
``Gonets'' satellites that will be used to transmit various 
kinds of information, including signals for E-mail service. The 
whole world is showing interest in low-orbit satellites, though 
we have been using them for decades, strictly for military 
purposes, of course. The principal advantages of communication 
systems with such satellites are low cost, and the capability of 
using simple and inexpensive terminals. The SPA of AM is now 
working on the first civilian low-orbit satellite, which last 
year was granted a ``visa'' for the radio band of 300/400 MHz by 
the World Administrative Conference on Radio Frequencies 
(WACR-92). Plans call for launching 36 ``Gonets'' satellites 
into circular orbit at an altitude of about 1500 km. The 
low-orbit satellite system should begin working in 1994-1995. 
  Another new thing learned by those attending the press 
conference: ``Gals'' satellites with three-band on-board relay, 
and ``Gals-R'' satellites with four-band relay. This equipment 
can be used to organize regional television broadcasting to 
individual small-sized receiver stations. Five sets will be 
integrated into a group to provide relay broadcasting to five 
two-hour time zones of as many as four television and radio 
programs. For signal reception from ``Gals,'' the Scientific 
Research Institute of Radio has developed ground stations with 
antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter (professional) and 0.9 m in 
diameter (individual). 
  Nor did speakers fail to give attention to the ``Marafon'' 
mobile satellite system, which has been a topic of discussion 
for several years. It turns out that it will be introduced in 
the not very distant future. ``Arkos'' satellites are to be 
launched into geostationary orbit next year, and ``Mayak'' 
satellites will be put into highly elliptical orbit in 
1995-1996. Five ``Arkoses'' and four ``Mayaks'' will be the 
basis of the ``Marafon'' system that will begin to operate in 
full volume early next century. The throughput of the future 
system will be 1800-2000 telephone channels. 
  Naturally, the expense of implementing such an ambitious 
Program will be enormous. The handouts at the press conference 
gave a figure of 13 billion rubles for the period from 1992 
through the year 2000 in 1991 prices. Where do we intend to get 
this money? It was explained that only 9.8 percent of this sum 
will be taken from the federal budget. All the rest will come 
from monies outside the budget. It is proposed that interest be 
maximized on the part of Russian businessmen and foreign 
investors. The SPA of AM has already made good progress in 
accumulating experience in such business activity by offering to 
lease Russian satellites to foreign companies, including 
launching services and technical support. 
  Another example of international cooperation in space is the 
Russian- Canadian project ``Sovkanstar,'' providing for setting 
up an international commercial satellite communication system to 
cover Russia and several other nations. Our specialists will 
design the satellite platform, and the Canadians will design the 
payload: a relay and antennas with minimum weight and energy 
consumption. Provisions also call for production of inexpensive 
Russian ground stations with antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter 
intended for business communications. In a word, our work in 
aeronautics and space, which has recently been on the brink of 
economic disaster, may now become a rather lucrative business.

Provinces''] 
  [Text] Joint Venture "Sprint Set" began 
operation in 1991. It was set up by Central Telegraph (Moscow) 
and the U.S. corporation Sprint International Communications 
with annual income of more than 9 billion dollars, which has the 
world's largest data network and produces communications 
equipment. 
  ``Sprint Set'' in Moscow: telephone (095)201-68-90; fax 
(095)923-23-44; telex 414750 SOVSN SU 
  Those of us who have tried, especially from outlying 
districts, to fax a business letter or personal correspondence 
to another nation know what a headache it is to have to dial up 
the operator, place the order, wait in line... 
  At the same time, by using the ``Sprint Global Fax'' system 
that has just been introduced into Russia by the Russian-U.S. 
joint venture ``Sprint Set,'' even a provincial owner of a fax 
machine need only dial a Moscow number on a conventional 
telephone line, and his message will be automatically faxed to 
one or a hundred addresses in any nations of the world. 
  ``We are trying to do everything to make the level of 
communication services of developed nations accessible to 
ordinary people in Russia and other nations of the former 
USSR,'' says Henry Radzikowski, director general of "Sprint Set" 
joint venture. ``To do so, we have concluded agreements with 
major telegraph offices on Russian territory, and have installed 
modern communication nodes in such cities as St. Petersburg, 
Rostov-na-Donu, Novosibirsk, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk and 
Khabarovsk. This equipment, produced by 'Sprint International 
Communications,' a U.S. telecommunications corporation, has 
become the main data network for computer communications in 
Russia.'' 
  ``The creation of structures in provinces in partnership 
with 
local communications enterprises and other investors that might 
participate in organizing and operating modern communication 
nodes is one of the top- priority goals of `Sprint Set','' 
continues Henry Radzikowski. ``In future, we will reach a point 
where we can install a minimum set of equipment in oblast 
centers, and even rayon centers; then people in the most remote 
province will be able to have reliable communication with the 
entire world. We are also supplying equipment to our partners 
who are setting up their own communication centers, but are 
connected to us. Among others, there are already such centers in 
Perm, Kiev, Riga, Tashkent, Vladivostok and other cities of the 
CIS and Baltic states. In the near future, there will be such 
centers in Novosibirsk, Yakutsk, Omsk, Tomsk, Barnaul and 
Volgograd. The communication services of `Sprint Set' are also 
proliferated through a network of distributors. In other words, 
we would like to facilitate creation of the most modern data 
utility network in cities of the CIS and Baltic states that will 
have an outlet to 110 world nations via the SprintNet global 
data network.'' 
  In the words of sales and marketing director Tatyana 
Prokhorova, the most popular service among clients is E-mail: 
``This is the exchange of electronic messages, transmission to 
the fax or telex of another subscriber at any point on the 
globe. Last year, `Sprint Set' finished work enabling E-mail 
subscribers to interact with 120,000 clients of the Russian 
AT-50 teleprinter exchange service.'' 
  ``Among our clients are the Ministry of Defense, the 
Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Security of Russia, the 
Russian affiliate of the World Association of Nuclear Plant 
Operators, Morflot, `Interfaks' Information Agency, and major 
world corporations like IBM, Texaco, 3M, and British Petroleum.'' 
  Tatyana Prokhorova emphasizes that more than 100 ``nearby'' 
and ``remote'' foreign banks have become clients, using ``Sprint 
Set'' to expedite handling of negotiable instruments and 
information both within their own system and among separate 
banks. The joint venture also assists them in organizing 
electronic correspondence with foreign partners. The system of 
communication services offered by the company, which is based on 
the capabilities of the data network, hardware and software for 
handling transactions, among other things enables banking, 
commercial and travel institutions within seconds to verify the 
credit of a customer using a charge card, and to automatically 
process data for clearing transactions for goods and services. 
  The rapidly developing package and complexity of services 
offered by ``Sprint Set,'' from furnishing communication lines 
to delivery of turnkey equipment in accordance with customer 
specifications, their exceptionally high quality and 24-hour 
customer support has made ``Sprint Set'' a leader in the 
development of modern technology of data transmission on the 
territory of the former USSR. 
  The joint venture has developed and put into service an 
extensive network for Bashkortostan, contracts have been signed 
and the development of republic-wide data networks has begun in 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 
  The joint venture has made an announcement of production of 
advanced telecommunication equipment in Russia. 
  But still the basic attraction is that ``Sprint Set'' joint 
venture knows how to organize and conduct telecommunication 
business oriented toward customer needs. Under conditions of 
market development and the necessity of converting from 
antiquated to modern communication technologies, this factor is 
becoming decisive.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Hands Across the Baltic: Russian </F>
President B. N. Yeltsin Has Opened a New Automatic International 
Communication System''] 
  [Text] Unusual animation held sway in the room of the 
Moscow international dial office in the capital region of 
Belyayevo on the morning of 10 April. A crowd of journalists, 
our own and from other nations, high-level European and U.S. 
diplomats, and finally, the arriving presidential entourage 
entering the room headed by B. N. Yeltsin, all bore witness to 
the importance of the forthcoming event. Such considerable 
attention to the international communication system brought 
about by the efforts of specialists, organizations and companies 
from Russia, Denmark and other nations was no coincidence: for 
the first time Russia and Western Europe were being joined by a 
fiber-optics communication line laid at the bottom of the Baltic 
Sea. 
  And so, from this day forth, our citizens can be connected 
with no great effort to 170 world nations, and in Moscow and St. 
Petersburg there will be no need to go through operators and be 
bothered with waiting for the call to be completed: callers will 
be able to dial direct to almost any point on the globe. Such is 
the result of concerted work by the ``Intertelekom'' Joint-Stock 
Company and its foreign partners: Telecom Denmark, the Great 
Northern Telegraph Company of Denmark, and a number of other 
companies from Europe, the United States and Japan. The fiber- 
optics communication line that they have laid at the bottom of 
the Baltic in conjunction with a number of new radio relay lines 
and municipal dial offices is capable of carrying 15,360 
simultaneous telephone calls. We remind you that just last year 
there were only 2900 international channels in all of Russia, 
and the only Moscow international dial office, built in 1980, 
was pretty well overloaded. 
  The end points of the new communication line, which is 2085 
km long, are Moscow and the Danish town of Albertslund near 
Copenhagen, where the fiber-optics communication line is 
connected to the international telephone network. The underwater 
fiber-optics cable, 4 cm in diameter, consists of two pairs of 
fibers having throughput of 565 Mbit/s, and is 1250 km long. On 
the Russian shore, the cable emerges onto dry land in the 
vicinity of Kingisepp. Thence to St. Petersburg and Moscow, 
where three new international telephone offices are installed, 
the relay race is continued by two radio relay lines with 
lengths of 124 and 810 km respectively. The section of the radio 
relay line to Moscow is designed for 5760 channels (3x140 
Mbit/s), and the one to St. Petersburg for 3840 channels (2x140 
Mbit/s). In addition, each main section has a reserve 10 Mbit/s 
trunk that is automatically connected in case of malfunctions. 
  It took just two months to lay the cable along the sea 
bottom, a time that was full of the most unexpected problems for 
those taking part in this complicated operation: Danish cable 
specialists and our divers. For the first time in world 
practice, the task was to bury the cable 60 cm under the bottom 
over the entire multikilometer line. However, it was not until 
work had already begun that it was learned that the heavy marine 
plow, weighing 25 metric tons, by which the cable was to be 
buried, could not be used along the shallow Russian coast. 
Divers had to do the job. But the plow could not always be used 
even in the open sea because it ``stumbled'' over other cables 
or rocky ground. And here all kinds of contrivances had to be 
devised. And when laying the shore cable near Kingisepp under 
arduous land conditions, the builders used an unusual approach: 
the excavator was set up on a raft from which the machine first 
broke through ice, and then made a trench along the bottom in 
which divers laid the cable. Nevertheless, difficulties did not 
stop the project from completion on time. 
  Expenditures on construction of the system amounted to 500 
million rubles and 123 million U.S. dollars. The principal 
investors were the "Intertelekom" Joint-Stock Company, the 
Danish companies Telecom Denmark and GNTC, and also the American 
company U.S. West International. Construction of the new line 
did not impact in any way on growth of the national debt of the 
country, as the government of Russia offered no financial 
guarantees to the parties in the project. At the same time, all 
of the system situated on our territory, and also the underwater 
section of the fiber-optics communication line to the midway 
point have become the property of Russia. 
  Equipment suppliers were determined on a competitive basis. 
They were the British company STC Submarine Systems which 
supplied the optical cable, amplifiers and other equipment for 
the underwater line; the Japanese company NEC, which furnished 
the digital equipment for the relay section; and the Croatian 
company Nikola Tesla which installed its AXE-10 digital 
switching offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Credit for 
purchase of the AXE-10 dial offices in the amount of 34.5 
million dollars was provided by U.S. West Int. The Moscow 
offices are designed for 7801 and 4780 channels and lines, and 
the St. Petersburg office for 4170. 
  The Russian President became the first subscriber to the 
system. At the festive opening ceremony in the presence of a 
throng of guests, B. N. Yeltsin and the Danish Prime Minister P. 
Rasmussen had a talk by videophone, ending with a symbolic 
handshake between the leaders of the two nations bound by the 
five-hundred year history of their diplomatic relations. Boris 
Nikolayevich praised the work of Russian and foreign specialists 
who had taken part in setting up the Denmark-Russia line, and 
presented the distinguished order of Friendship of Nations. 
Those present were congratulated for completion of construction 
by Minister of Communications of the Russian Federation V. B. 
Bulgak, and by the heads of diplomatic delegations of Denmark 
and the United States; there was also an announcement of a 
message sent by U.S. President B. Clinton to B. N. Yeltsin on 
the occasion of opening up the new international 
telecommunication system. 
  However, in the words of V. B. Bulgak, there is still a long 
way to go before the needs of the nation for international 
telephone service are satisfied. Therefore plans have been made 
to begin operation of the Southern, Eastern and Trans-Siberian 
sections of a trunk that will close the world telecommunication 
ring before 1998. The overall capacity of the international 
telephone offices of Russia, according to tentative estimates, 
will be 29,000 channels in 1995, 40,500 in the year 2000, and 
64,000 by the year 2005. 
  Within the scope of the Southern project, it is proposed 
that 
a Novosibirsk-Istanbul-Palermo fiber-optics communication line 
be built, 3400 km long, with an extension to Moscow (1622 km), 
and also that an international telephone office be opened in 
Rostov-na-Donu. The Eastern project includes a 
Russia-Japan-Korea underwater fiber-optics communication line 
1809 km long with 930-kilometer Nakhodka-Khabarovsk cable 
section. On the Trans-Siberian section of the trunk, a Moscow- 
Khabarovsk digital radio relay line is to be constructed, 8300 
km in length with capacity of 11,520 channels. It is planned 
that international telephone offices will be introduced by 
stages in Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Samara. 
Foreign communications operators and producers of equipment will 
take an active part in realization of these projects. 
  Opening of the Russia-Denmark line has provided a rather 
graphic demonstration that cooperation with us in such 
large-scale projects is not only possible, but even 
advantageous. For example, Telecom Denmark has already sold part 
of the capacity of the new underwater cable to 22 communications 
operators from the United States, Belgium, Italy, Germany, 
France and other nations. From the very beginning of operation 
of the Trans-Siberian trunk, there will certainly be even more 
extensive opportunities for cooperation in the field of 
communications.

nuclear station developer, and USSR State Committee for Safety 
in Industry and Atomic Power Industry should be corrected by the

contain a list of initial events and an analysis of departures 
from normal operation, a study of design and off-design 
emergencies, and a classification of design and off-design 
accidents based on the probability of their development and the 
severity of their consequences. Accidents with a severe damage 
or reactor core meltdown should be considered among off-design 
emergencies. 
  In designing the reactor plant, one should strive to ensure 
that the probability of a severe damage or reactor core meltdown 
in the case of an off-design emergency does not exceed 
10[.sup]-5[/] per reactor per year.

in the appendix. 
  2.2.3. The reactor plant detail design must demonstrate that 
given design emergencies related to a rapid increase in

such a way that given normal operation, departures from normal 
operation, and design emergencies, the corresponding fuel 
element damage limits are not exceeded allowing for the 
following:

given an unforeseen movement of the most effective end effector 
of the reactivity control system or a group of end effectors, 
the safe operation limits are not exceeded with respect to the 
fuel element damage allowing for the emergency reactor 
protection system operation without one of the most effective 
end effectors of the emergency reactor protection system. 
  2.2.10. Given normal operation, departures from normal 
operation, and design emergencies, the possibility of unforeseen 
movements and/or deformation of the core elements resulting in 
an increase in reactivity and deterioration of the heat removal 
conditions leading to a fuel element damage above and beyond the 
corresponding design limits must be ruled out. 
  2.2.11. The core and reactivity control facility 
characteristics must ensure that introduction of the reactivity 
control facilities into the core and/or reflector for any 
combination of their arrangement under normal operation, 
departures from normal operation, and design emergencies ensures 
introduction of negative reactivity at any section of their 
movement path. 
  2.2.12. The fuel assembly design must ensure that the change 
in the shape of fuel elements and other fuel assembly elements 
possible under normal operations, departures from normal 
operation, and design emergencies does not result in blocking 
the fuel assembly flow section leading to a fuel element damage 
above the corresponding limits and does not prevent normal 
functioning of the end effectors of the reactivity control 
system of the reactor.

limits and with departures from normal operation; and 
  an effectiveness sufficient for switching the reactor core 
to 
the subcritical state and maintaining it in the subcritical 
state given departures from normal operation and design 
emergencies. In the case where the emergency reactor protection 
system efficiency is not sufficient for maintaining the reactor 
core in the subcritical state for an extended period, automatic

protection system equipment set fail without failure of the set 
itself, an emergency signal must be automatically generated for 
this channel.

staff and without the operation of the emergency reactor 
protection system end effectors. 
  2.3.2.26. Execution of the emergency reactor protection 
system function should not depend on the availability and 
condition of power supply sources. 
  2.3.3. Requirements for the Neutron Flux and Reactivity 
Monitoring and Control 
  2.3.3.1. In order to monitor the neutron flux, the reactor 
must be equipped with monitoring channels so that monitoring is 
executed by at least the following devices within the entire 
variation range of the neutron flux density in the reactor core 
from 10[.sup]-7[/]% to 120% of the rated value:

  by three independent channels measuring the rate of change 
in 
the neutron flux density. 
  2.3.3.2. The admissibility of combining the instrument 
sections of the neutron flux density level monitoring channels 
with the instrument parts of the channels measuring the rate of 
change in the neutron flux density must be justified by the 
reactor plant detail design. 
  2.3.3.3. At least two of the three neutron flux density 
monitoring channels must be equipped with recording devices 
capable of connecting to any neutron flux density measurement 
channel and ensuring measurements without the entire design 
neutron flux density range. 
  2.3.3.4. The neutron flux density monitoring channels must 
be 
calibrated within the entire design range of thermal reactor 
power. The reactor plant detail design must justify and define 
the procedure and sequence of carrying out such calibration and 
its intervals in the course of reactor plant operation.

  Permissible reactor plant power levels during failures of 
the 
automatic control system and the possibility of the reactor 
plant operation without the automatic power control system must 
be justified in the reactor plant detail design. 
  2.3.3.11. When several measurement channels are connected to 
the input of the automatic power control system, the design must 
stipulate a device for obtaining a signal from the operating 
instrument channels so that disconnection or failure of one of 
these channels does not lead to changes in the reactor power 
under the effect of the automatic control system.

effectors to the working position with the remaining end 
effectors of the reactivity control system inserted into the 
reactor core must be at least 0.01 when the reactor core is 
characterized by a state with the maximum effective 
multiplication factor. 
  2.3.3.15. Failure of the channel for monitoring the neutron

requirements imposed on the facilities which ensure the on-line 
computer-aided measurement and recording of the current 
reactivity margin value in the reactor core during operation, 
on-line measurements of reactivity, total efficiency of 
reactivity control facilities, the efficiency of the emergency 
reactor protection system end effectors, the efficiency of the 
end effector groups of the reactivity control system, and the 
reactivity coefficients with respect to the parameters which

the facilities and techniques for monitoring the reactor core 
subcriticality.

the facilities for measuring the energy release nonuniformity in 
the reactor core as well as indicate the requirements for the 
facilities of on-line analysis of the burnout/dryout/DNB margin.

personnel actions. To this end, a recording system which should 
record the following must be provided: 
  the parameters and symptoms of the status characterizing the 
initial events or the parameters which make it possible to 
determine the initial event unambiguously; 
  control signals; 
  a change in the parameters which characterize the status of 
reactor plant systems crucial for safety; 
  a change in the parameters in response to which protection 
systems are activated; 
  a change in the parameters characterizing the radiation 
environment; and 
  operating staff conversations over intercom systems. 
  The scope and scale of recording must be justified and

etc.) and to failures of the principal reactor plant equipment 
which demonstrate the absence of reactions dangerous to the 
reactor plant. 
  Should reactions dangerous to the reactor plant be 
identified

and technical measures must be taken for eliminating them and 
for making the corresponding amendments in the reactor plant 
detail design in an established fashion. 
  2.4.11. The reactor plant and its systems must be controlled 
from the generating-unit control panel, and if necessary, from 
local control stations. 
  2.4.12. In addition to the generating-unit control panel, 
each generating unit must be equipped with a back-up control 
panel from which the reactor core can be switched to the 
subcritical state and from which emergency generating unit

process parameters necessary for the reactor plant safety if 
this cannot be done from the generating-unit control panel for 
whatever reason (fire, etc.).

local control stations must be stipulated in the reactor plant 
detail design.

  [Text] PREFACE 
  More than six years have elapsed since that fateful day when 
the explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant became a new benchmark in the history of development not 
only of nuclear power, but of all human civilization. The 
consequences of this unprecedented disaster have directly or 
indirectly impacted on the destinies of entire nations and 
regions, millions of people, and natural systems, and will be 
felt for many decades to come in future generations. Therefore 
from the very inception and up until the present our scientists 
and specialists and their foreign colleagues have never ceased 
for a single day their work on analysis of the causes and 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the search for ways 
to overcome them. 
  In the former USSR, this activity has been carried out by a 
number of governmental and non-governmental organizations, among 
which an important part has been played by the Commission of the 
Supreme Soviet of the USSR on Examining the Causes of the 
Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant and 
Evaluating the Actions of Officials in the Post-Accident Period. 
Working within this Commission has been a Standing Panel of 
Experts (SPE) including about 200 eminent specialists 
representing many fields of science and engineering in all three 
of the republics hardest hit by the disaster: Belarus, Ukraine 
and Russia. This group of scientists has done tremendous work on 
gathering, analyzing and generalizing a large body of materials, 
most of which were scattered throughout agencies and over 
territories, making access difficult. A lot of new information 
was also obtained directly at the locality of the events, 
including at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant itself. 
  Although the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was dissolved in 
late 
1991, the activity of the SPE nevertheless did not stop. 
SENMURV, a non- governmental international society for restoring 
the environment and safe habitation of man, has considered 
offering support to the panel of experts as its civil and moral 
obligation. Such cooperation proceeds from the logic of creation 
and activity of SENMURV, as reflected in its charter and name. 
How to reduce the detrimental impact of irrational human 
actions, how to protect Man, his health, the health of nations, 
how to restore our environment--these are the main problems that 
united scientists and businessmen of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine 
in the SENMURV International Society. 
  Over the last two decades, especially in the eighties, the 
scales and depth of consequences of economic and other activity 
on the territory of Russia and other CIS nations for nature and 
society have reached the limit beyond which an ecological 
problem has grown into a problem of national security, survival 
of a nation in the long-term historical perspective. 
  The global nature of ill-considered human activity in 
mining, 
carrying out large-scale power engineering projects, development 
of industry, transportation and the agroindustrial complex has 
resulted in an unpredictable ecological situation. Anthropogenic 
alterations of landscapes, demographic shifts, concentration of 
ecologically harmful production facilities on limited areas, and 
disregard for requirements of creating low-waste production 
facilities have given rise to totally new ecological factors 
that could lead to irreversible genetic changes in populations 
and communities. 
  Besides the continual poisoning of nature and people with 
wastes of harmful substances of existing enterprises, the 
presence of a large number of burial sites of radioactive and 
chemical wastes, threatening gradual exhaustion of the 
ecological potential and gene pool of Russia, there has been an 
increase in the risk of technogenic disasters. Damage due to 
industrial accidents alone averages 1.2-1.5 percent of the GNP, 
and in the most severe accidents like the one at Chernobyl, it 
exceeds the given figures by nearly an order of magnitude. Last 
but not least, as a result of such extraordinary situations, and 
also because ecological requirements are not met in handling 
radioactive (and other toxic) wastes and the acquisition of 
uranium deposits, Russia and other CIS nations are now faced 
with just about the worst radioecological scenario in the world. 
  Based on the urgency of its tasks, as well as on the 
professional orientation of its specialists, the SENMURV 
International Society is concentrating its activity on restoring 
the environment and safe habitation of man, combining 
international efforts of businessmen and scientists representing 
various fields of knowledge: biotechnology, physical chemistry, 
biology, biophysics, medicine, mathematics and systems analysis. 
Such an interdisciplinary approach is a guarantee of rapid 
advancement in problems of ecology, revealing new ways of 
solving them, and especially the Chernobyl problem. 
  Within the framework of the SENMURV International Society, 
the aforementioned panel of experts has been transformed to a 
Joint Expert Committee (JEC), which can be treated as its 
successor. This committee has continued work on preparation of 
its chief document: the expert conclusion that is being 
presented in this publication. The expert conclusion consists of 
four volumes: 
  Part 1. ``Direct Causes of Accident at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Plant. Radiation Monitoring. Protective Measures and 
Their Effectiveness.'' 
  Part 2. ``Medical-Biological and Genetic Consequences of the 
Chernobyl Disaster.'' 
  Part 3. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant for the Republic of Belarus.'' 
  Part 4. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant for Ukraine and Russia.'' 
  The following expert coordinators guided the team of authors 
in preparation of this expert conclusion: 
  V. B. Nesterenko--professor, associate member of Belarus 
Academy of Sciences. 
  Ye. B. Burlakova--professor, Chairwoman of Council on 
Radiobiology of Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  Ye. A. Yakovlev--Academician of Ukrainian Ecological Academy 
of Sciences. 
  V. A. Shevchenko--professor. 
  N. A. Tsepalova--candidate of chemical sciences. 
  D. S. Firsova--journalist, laureate of Lenin and State 
prizes 
of the USSR. 
  A. G. Nazarov--professor, associate member of Russian 
Academy 
of Natural Sciences. 
  B. N. Profiryev--professor, associate member of Russian 
Academy of Natural Sciences. 
  D. P. Osanov--professor. 
  G. S. Sakulin--professor. 
  L. N. Shadrin--professor. 
  While not all parts of this expert conclusion are of equal 
significance, all experts have endeavored to be maximally 
objective in analyzing events and documents, as well as in 
offering differing viewpoints. This has been aided by giving 
each expert creative freedom, the opportunity of setting up 
creative teams and formulating conclusions without hindrance. 
  Considerable assistance was provided to the panel of experts 
on the first stage of its work by the ``Chernobyl-Pomoshch'' 
Non-Governmental International Humanitarian Organization. 
  If this expert conclusion will attract the attention not 
just 
of specialists, economists and politicians, but simply the 
people living on contaminated territories and the public at 
large, we will feel that our labor has made its contribution to 
analysis of the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl 
disaster. 
  We hope that the number of supporters of those who have 
devoted their activity and are giving their efforts and energy 
to restoring our environment will increase, and then the 
concepts of ``Man. Earth. Universe'' will become indivisible and 
everlasting. That man might live forever and dwell on a 
blossoming, beautiful earth, unique and inimitable in the 
universe.

  Conclusion 
  a. Concerning State of Health of Cleanup Crew 
  As a result of our radiation-epidemiological examination of 
those taking part in cleaning up the aftermath of the accident, 
estimates have been obtained for the dynamics of general somatic 
morbidity for 1987-1991. 
  A statistically reliable general increase in morbidity was 
found, as well as a dose-dependent increase in number of the 
following illnesses among cleanup personnel: 
  1. diseases of the nervous system; 2. mental disorders; 3. 
diseases of the blood and circulatory organs; 4. diseases of 
organs of digestion; 5. sympathovascular dystonia 
  The dose-effect curve for these illnesses is bimodal: 
indices 
of morbidity in the group exposed to a dose of less than 5 cGy 
show a statistically reliable difference from the frequency of 
illnesses for the group irradiated with a dose of more than 30 
cGy, suggesting that the increase in the number of these 
illnesses is associated with the fact of irradiation and those 
induced by it. Based on our study of medical aspects of the 
consequences of the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant, and data of examination of victims under conditions of 
the clinic of military-field therapy of S. M. Kirov Military 
Medical Academy, we can conclude that among persons taking part 
in cleaning up the aftermath of the accident at Chernobyl 
Nuclear Electric Power Plant, not only was there an increase in 
frequency of some disorders, but there was also found to be a 
unique evolution and course of pathological processes: 
  1. Presence of a variety of clinical-hematological disorders 
in the form of isolated or combined cytopenias. The degree and 
dynamics of these disorders differ among the studied contingents 
of victims: those taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the 
accident in 1986-1987; residents evacuated from the 30-km zone 
during the first 7-10 days; residents remaining in radioactively 
contaminated localities. After five days, we continue to observe 
disorders of bone-marrow hemogenesis, including cellular 
differentiation. 
  2. Evolution and unusual course of illnesses of the 
gastroenteritic tract with manifestation of gastrointestinal 
syndrome during the early months following the accident, and 
atrophic erosive hypochlorhydric and achlorhydric gastritides, 
ulcers and stomach polyps. 
  3. Development of pathology of the cardiovascular system 
among a considerable number of victims. Rapid escalation of 
functional disorders into organic shifts is observed 
(neurocirculatory dystonia of various types into hypertonia and 
ischemia), early development of atherosclerotic shifts. 
  4. Occurrence of pathology of the orl-organs and organs of 
respiration from the first days of staying in the zone of the 
accident with subsequent development of atrophic processes of 
the mucous upper respiratory passages. 
  5. Occurrence of disorders of the central nervous system in 
the form of asthenic and vegetative manifestations among most of 
those taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the accident. 
Subsequently there is a rapid progression of disturbances of 
marrow hemogenesis. In isolated cases, shifts of mental state 
are observed. 
  6. Skin disorders in the form of beta-dermatitides of the 
lower extremities and face. 
  The cause of these disorders was not only the effect of 
external beta and gamma radiation, but also incorporation of 
radionuclides and other harmful substances, which was confirmed 
by mass-spectrometric studies (presence of long-lived 
radionuclides: nuclear fuel fragments, boron, lanthanides and so 
on). 
  b. Concerning State of Health of Juvenile Population 
  The overall morbidity of children on 
radionuclide-contaminated territories increased until 1989. In 
the structure of morbidity, a leading place belongs to diseases 
of the respiratory organs, infectious and parasitic, diseases of 
the organs of digestion, the endocrine system, blood and 
hemogenic system (especially iron-deficiency anemias), and 
neuropsychiatric disorders. 
  All republics show an increase in the group of chronically 
ill children, especially with respiratory illnesses. Among 
children of the younger age group who were born to mothers 
pregnant at the time of the accident, the number of acute 
respiratory illnesses is doubled on average. 
  An increase is observed in the specific weight of kidney 
disorders in 1986-1990. There is an increase in frequency of 
abdominal pain, gastritis and dyspancreatism. There is an 
increase in the frequency of astheno-neurotic syndromes. 
  Children exposed to irradiation show high prevalence of 
functional deviations of the cardiovascular system, functional 
cardiopathies. Three fourths of children show sympathovascular 
dystonia, disturbances of sympathetic regulation, and so on. 
Children of preschool age receiving a high dose on the thyroid 
gland may be categorized in the cardiovascular pathology risk 
group. 
  Large shifts are observed in the frequency and severity of 
endocrinological disorders. Aggravation of the course of endemic 
diseases is noted: doubling of the growth of goiter, an increase 
in the number of children suffering from thyrotoxicosis. There 
is an increase in prevalence of hyperplasia of the thyroid 
gland, especially among children exposed to irradiation at the 
age of 1-3 years (three times as often as among other groups). 
Studies of hormonal status indicate the highest degree of 
radiation illness of the thyroid gland for children aged younger 
than three years. 
  There was an increase, especially in Belarus, in the number 
of children with cancer of the thyroid gland; for example, 51 
cases were diagnosed in 1990-1991, of which 29 were children 
from Gomelskaya Oblast. The data of analyses were verified not 
only in the Soviet Union, but also in special clinics of Germany 
and other nations. 
  A study of the immune state showed some reduction of 
cellular 
and humoral immunity, especially among children of women who 
became pregnant three months after the accident. This group of 
children is characterized by an increased number of anomalies of 
development. 
  On territories contaminated by radionuclides there are signs 
of an altered course as compared with the usual for some 
illnesses: bronchopulmonary pathologies and allergic disorders. 
Pneumonia among children shows a tendency toward a more severe 
and protracted course, and less sensitivity to antibiotics. 
  All children living on territories with elevated radiation 
background may be categorized in the group of risk with respect 
to development of unusual post-vaccination complications. 
  Thus, most significant is the change of the symptom complex 
in illnesses of children, and a more severe course of illnesses 
with greater difficulty of treatment. 
  These shifts are similar on radionuclide-contaminated 
territories in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and give evidence 
that the Chernobyl accident has impacted on the health of 
children. 
  c. Concerning the State of Health of the Populace 
  Examination of the population of radionuclide-contaminated 
territories of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia revealed a 
significant growth in frequency of some diseases (both absolute 
and relative). This applies to illnesses of the blood and 
hemogenic organs, endocrine disorders, diseases of the 
gastroenteritic tract and urogenital system, neural and mental 
disorders. Illnesses assume a more severe and protracted nature, 
and are more difficult to treat. An increase is observed in the 
number of malignant tumors, especially cancerous diseases of the 
thyroid gland. 
  In Gomelskaya, Mogilevskaya and Bryanskaya oblasts, a 
special 
epidemiological examination revealed a statistically significant 
increase in the incidence of leukemia and other hemoblastoses in 
older age groups in 1988-1989 (mainly with chronic course). 
  Examination of the population of radionuclide-contaminated 
territories of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia revealed a 
significant growth in frequency of some diseases (both absolute 
and relative). This applies to illnesses of the blood, diabetes 
for Bryanskaya Oblast, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes, 
chronic lympholeucosis for Gomelskaya and Mogilevskaya oblasts, 
cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders for Ukraine, 
cancer of the thyroid gland for Belarus. 
  Thus, the results of examination of the cleanup crew and of 
the juvenile and adult population residing on contaminated 
territories have shown the detrimental impact of the Chelyabinsk 
accident on state of health. 
  General Findings 
  1. After analyzing the materials of various medical 
institutions, statistical data of the Ministries of Public 
Health of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, USSR and republic 
registries, it can be stated that the Chernobyl accident has had 
a detrimental impact on the state of health of the population 
residing on radionuclide-contaminated territories and of those 
taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the accident. In all 
cases, an increase is observed in general morbidity, and in some 
cases in relative morbidity, a reduction in the number of people 
acknowledged as healthy, intensification of severity of 
illnesses and extension of its duration, and less sensitivity of 
disease to the action of medication. There is an increase in the 
number of diseases of the blood and hemogenic organs, 
endocrinological diseases, diseases of the gastroenteritic tract 
and urogenital system, nervous and mental disorders. For many 
cases, it is found that the number and severity of diseases 
depend on the dose of irradiation. There is an increase in the 
total number of oncological patients due to an increase in the 
number of cancerous diseases of the thyroid gland, 
lympholeucoses, and non- Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
  2. Persons taking part in cleanup of the aftermath of the 
accident and residents of radionuclide-contaminated regions show 
elevation by several times in the level of aberrations of 
chromosomes in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood that is 
uniquely related to irradiation dose and dose rate. A tendency 
is noted toward an increase in the level of aberrations of 
chromosomes in time among children permanently residing on 
territories with an elevated level of radiation. An elevated 
level of aberrations of chromosomes in lymphocytes of the 
peripheral blood is evidence of real genetic injury of cells of 
the human organism due to the Chernobyl disaster. 
  In regions most contaminated with radionuclides, an increase 
is observed in intrauterine losses during pregnancy, most of 
which have genetic etiology. 
  A statistically significant increase is observed in the 
frequency of congenital anomalies in close follow-up in regions 
most highly contaminated with radionuclides as compared with the 
period prior to the accident. This is also a consequence of 
injury of genetic material among persons residing in regions hit 
by the Chernobyl disaster. 
  A considerable fraction of the genetic damage due to the 
Chernobyl disaster is anticipated among the progeny of 
irradiated parents in the form of multifactor hereditary 
diseases that show up throughout a person's lifetime, chiefly 
during middle and advanced age.

  Abstract 
  The report presents an expert conclusion regarding 
consequences of the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant for the Republic of Belarus, medical and radiological 
consequences for the populace, organization of radiation 
monitoring of food products to safeguard the populace in regions 
hit by the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Requirements are set forth for the sensitivity of ordinary 
and professional radiometric instruments for radiation 
monitoring of food products based on supporting the concept of 
residence of the populace in regions contaminated by 
radionuclides from the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Information is presented on setting up independent local 
centers for radiation monitoring of food products and the 
environment in centers of population of the Republic of Belarus. 
  Medical and biological consequences for the populace 
following the Chernobyl disaster are examined. 
  The report sets forth the scales of damage to forestry and 
agriculture as a result of the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant and gives recommendations on management of 
agricultural production and use of forests on territories 
contaminated by radionuclides. 
  Keywords: radiation conditions in Republic 
of Belarus, radiation monitors and radiometers, systems of 
radiation monitoring of food products, medical and biological 
consequences of Chernobyl disaster for the populace, management 
of forestry and agriculture on radionuclide-contaminated 
territories. 
  Introduction 
  Systems of radiation and ecological monitoring of the 
environment in Belarus, as in other regions of the nation, are 
narrowly departmental as a rule. In most centers of population, 
Belgidromet regularly determines the radiation conditions with 
respect to isotopes cesium-137, strontium- 90 and plutonium-239. 
Maps have been published of the radiation contamination of the 
territory of the republic with cesium-137, as well as 
strontium-90 and plutonium-239. At the same time, the 
representativeness and confidence of these maps are inadequate. 
At present only one measurement per 50 ha is taken on 
agricultural lands, and in centers of population with extent of 
1.5-2 kilometers, only 15-20 measurements. For example, within 
the confines of the village of Veprin in Cherikovskiy Rayon of 
Mogilevskaya Oblast, according to data of the former State 
Hydrometeorological Committee of the USSR the density of 
contamination with isotope cesium-137 is 1184 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. However, according to data of a mobile 
radiometric laboratory equipped with a "CANBERRA" gamma 
spectrometer, a detailed study done on 24 March 1991 revealed an 
extensive zone on one street with contamination of the order of 
1850-2035 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. A significant contribution to 
protective measures has been made by household studies of 
radiation conditions and compilation of radiation certificates 
of centers of population of the republic. Radiation 
certification of centers of population has basically been 
completed on contaminated territories, although certification of 
housing and garden plots continues. Certification of woodlands 
and agricultural fields is being done by the Ministry of 
Forestry and the Ministry of Agricultural Products of the 
republic respectively. 
  In 1986-1988 when determining protective measures, good 
reasons were found for leaning toward the use of density of 
contamination of lands with radionuclides as an information 
index. Since completing resettlement of residents away from 
centers of population with density of contamination by 
cesium-137 of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and strontium-90 
of 111 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], and also families with children away 
from the zone with contamination density of more than 555 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/], the overall dose of external radiation for 
most regions does not exceed 10-40 percent, and the principal 
dose of irradiation of residents in affected regions is obtained 
from internal irradiation due to using local food products 
contaminated by radionuclides. 
  Up until August 1990 in Belarus, as in other republics 
affected by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant, standards VDU-88 [for temporary admissible levels] were 
in effect that allowed exposure to internal irradiation due to 
radionuclide-contaminated food products of 0.7-0.8 rem per year. 
Laws of the republic on social protection of citizens affected 
by the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plantset an 
effective equivalent dose of the population resident on 
contaminated territories of not more than 0.1 rem per year (7 
rem for life). This has required the acceptance of new 
admissible levels of radionuclide contamination of food 
products. The introduction in Belarus on 1 August 1990 of new 
and more stringent control levels of admissible radionuclide 
contamination of food products was not supported by appropriate 
means of measurement, as most radiometric instruments were of 
type KRVP-4AB with inadequate sensitivity. 
  In November 1990, the international Commission on Radiation 
Protection set stricter upper limits of the dose of irradiation 
of professionals to 20 mSv per year (previously 50 mSv per 
year), and for the populace to 1 mSv per year (previously 5 mSv 
per year). The same ICRP recommendations (No 60, 1990) introduce 
a minimum limit of annual dose of 0.1 mSv for taking protective 
steps (all values stated over the dose burdens from the natural 
background). 
  In 1992, Belgidromet came out with a map of radioactive 
contamination of the territory of the republic with iodine-131 
and the dose rate due to this radionuclide in various regions. 
  In 1991, the Institute of Radiation Medicine of the Ministry 
of Public Health of the Rebpulic of Belarus compiled a catalog 
of doses of irradiation of residents for centers of population 
of the republic, where the density of contamination with 
radionuclide cesium-137 was more than 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. 
Dose loads were calculated by the approved procedure of the 
Ministry of Public Health for external irradiation with respect 
to dose rate and internal irradiation with respect to content of 
cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-239 in milk and potatoes. 
  The catalog covers 1111 centers of population of Gomelskaya, 
Mogilevskaya and Brestskaya Oblasts. In 1991, the dose of 
irradiation of residents exceeded 1 mSv per year in 610 centers 
of population. According to data of Belgidromet, there are more 
than 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities, on 
territories with cesium-137 contamination of more than 37 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. This number of centers of population should 
be increased due to villages and settlements in the Polesye 
district where the cesium-137 contamination density is 18.5-25.9 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and milk meeting standards RKU- 90 cannot be 
obtained. Thus, in 1992 we will need to measure the content of 
radionuclides in food products at more than 2500 centers of 
population of the republic. 
  Following completion of work on compiling the catalog of 
doses of irradiation of residents in centers of population of 
the republic, there will have to be a more precise definition of 
the previously assumed decisions on assuring safety of 
habitation on radionuclide-contaminated territories. 
  The report analyzes the main reasons for the unsatisfactory 
state of radiation-ecological conditions in the Belarus region 
and gives recommendations on necessary measures aimed at radical 
improvement of the situation that has evolved. 
  The book offers an analysis of the state of health of the 
populace of the Republic of Belarus since the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Creation of a network of local centers for radiation 
monitoring of food products for the populace along with the 
state radiation monitoring system will provide the population 
with means of protection from radionuclide-contaminated food 
products. 
  This report has been prepared by a panel of experts from 
Belarus; the base for doing the research was defined by the 
Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which was set up by 
the State Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of 
Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant and the International Chernobyl- Pomoshch non-governmental 
organization. 
  The basic goals and areas of activity of the Institute: 
  development of protective measures and regulations of safe 
production activity and habitation of the populace on 
radionuclide-contaminated territories; 
  comprehensive radiological examination of centers of 
population and territories subjected to radioactive 
contamination; 
  creation of local centers and preparation of dosimeters for 
monitoring food products for the populace, developing and 
producing radiometric instruments for radiation monitoring of 
food products and the environment. 
  Conclusions and Proposals 
  1. The Republic of Belarus was hardest hit by the Chernobyl 
disaster. To assess the scales of the disaster for the republic, 
the following data should be presented: 
  more than two thirds of the radionuclides discharged from 
the 
fourth unit at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant fell on 
Belarus, and one fifth of the territory of the republic was 
contaminated with radionuclides; 
  the population residing on territory with density of 
contamination by cesium-137 of more than 137 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] 
in the republic numbers 2,105,400 (including more than 400,000 
children) in 3668 centers of population, including 53 cities; 
  more than 100,000 people have been resettled from 
contaminated regions of the republic: in 1992, residents were 
resettled from all centers of population in regions with 
contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; more 
than 30,000 children reside on territory with density of 
contamination by cesium-137 of more than 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]; 
  the damage inflicted by the Chernobyl disaster on the 
Republic of Belarus, which does not have a single nuclear 
electric power plant, is expressed by sixteen annual budgets of 
the republic; 
  in the post-accident period, incidence of thyroid cancer 
among children increased by a factor of seven over the republic, 
and by a factor of 22 in Gomelskaya Oblast; 
  in zones of radioactive contamination of 17 regions of 
Mogilevskaya and Gomelskaya Oblasts, for three years after the 
accident the frequency of congenital defects of development in 
close follow-up nearly doubled in comparison with the period 
preceding the accident; 
  cytogenetic studies have shown that pregnant women (and 
fetuses) from the southern regions of Gomelskaya and 
Mogilevskaya Oblasts received doses of radiation that increase 
the overall level of spontaneous mutations of chromosomes by a 
factor of 1.5-2, and the number of dicentric and ring 
chromosomes in some mother-fetus pairs increased by a factor of 
4-10; 
  an absorbed dose of 400 cGy or more is considered a 
considerable risk factor of laboratory hypothyroidism and 
autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland among children; 
  significant prevalence of dyspancreatism syndrome has been 
established among children with level of incorporation of 
cesium-137 of more than 0.3 ÊCi/organism; 
  children residing on contaminated territories show greater 
frequency (compared with the control) of persistent asthenic 
states (by a factor of 2), hypochondriac syndrome (by a factor 
of 4.6), phobic syndrome (by a factor of 2.3) and so on; 
  among children and adolescents residing on contaminated 
territories, especially under conditions of elevated 
incorporation of cesium-137, there is an increase in disorders 
of the digestive system. For example, the occurrence of chronic 
gastritides and gastroduodenitises among children and 
adolescents in 1990 in these regions reached 171-297% (in 
the 
control--125-153%); 
  the level of recorded primary incidence of circulatory 
system 
disorders (CSD) in 1990 increased by comparison with 1985 by a 
factor of 3.5 over Gomelskaya Oblast, and by a factor of 2.5 
over Mogilevskaya Oblast. 
  2. The republic program for alleviating consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster for 1993-1995 and ahead to the year 2000 must 
take as a priority direction the production of clean food 
products, implementation of the concept of safe habitation of 
people on radionuclide-contaminated territories. 
  3. Contamination in the Republic of Belarus covers 45,600 
km[.sup]2[/] or 23 percent of the territory of the republic, 
more than 1,866,000 ha of arable land, of which 106,000 ha was 
removed from agricultural use in the first year following the 
disaster; in 1986-1989, a total of 256,700 of arable land was 
taken out of circulation. In 1990 alone, lands wiht Cesium-137 
contamination density of more than 1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] were 
eliminated from agricultural use, and finally, volumes of 
deliveries of meat and milk from these regions were reduced. 
  4. Research has shown that in the zone of contamination by 
radiocesium of up to 185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and by strontium-90 
of up to 11.1 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], all kinds of agricultural 
operations can be carried out by conventional technologies on 
arable lands. Forage with contamination density from 37 to 555 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/] is resown to grass. Radioactive contamination 
of territory by cesium-137 with density of more than 555 
kBq/m[.sup]2[/] makes stock raising unfeasible for practical 
purposes in this zone. 
  5. Standards have been set for the content of radioactive 
substances in agricultural raw material for producing goods 
corresponding to RKU-90 standards. Fodders should contain 5 x 
10[.sup]-8[/] - 1 x 10[.sup]- 8[/] Ci/kg. 
  6. In 1991-1992, the radiological services of the Ministries 
of Agriculture, Forestry, and Public Health significantly 
renovated their inventories of radiometric instruments for 
cesium-137 monitoring; the instruments have high sensitivity 
that allows monitoring to be done in accordance with standards 
RKU-90. Complete retooling in these enterprises requires 
delivery of more than 2000 new gamma-radiometers of Vityaz, 
Belrad, Aliot and RUP 01P6 type. 
  7. The level of admissible content of radionuclides 
according 
to RKU-90 in food products, and the specificity of the diet of 
food products for those living in Belarus are such that the 
possible annual dose burden may amount to 0.17-0.18 rem/yr. And 
milk, baked goods, potatoes and meat comprise more than 70 
percent of the accumulation of radionuclides in the organism. 
There is an acute need for 2-3 times more stringent radionuclide 
control levels with respect to grain, potatoes and milk. 
  8. Food products can be checked for strontium-90 and 
plutonium-239 content only by a radiochemical method (10-14 days 
for one measurement). Experimental models of beta-radiometers 
have been developed for instrumental determination of 
strontium-90 within a few hours (strontium-90 in soil of 20 
Bq/kg within 3-4 hours). Experimental models of alpha 
radiometers are being developed for instrumental determination 
of plutonium-239. 
  9. The law of the Republic of Belarus "On the Status of 
Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as a Result 
of the Chernobyl Disaster" (Article 40) acknowledges the 
advisability of setting up local centers (LC) for radiation 
monitoring (RM) of food products for the populace. According to 
a resolution and with the financial support of the State 
Committee of the Republic of Belarus on Problems of the 
Aftermath of the Chernobyl Disaster, 167 local centers for RM 
have been set up for rural Soviets in Gomelskaya (65), 
Mogilevskaya (42), Brestskaya (26) and Minskaya (14) Oblasts, 
and in the city of Minsk (20). 
  10. The Belorussian Institute of Radiation Safety, which is 
the head institute for LCs, is organizing LCs in the republic, 
and training capable local rural residents in radiation 
monitoring. Plans call for instituting more than 600 LCs in 
centers of population (generally the central homestead of farms) 
where the dose burden of the population exceeds 0.1 rem/yr. 
  11. Certification of the homesteads of villages and farms, 
use of adaptive technologies for agricultural production, 
compilation of maps of isotopic contamination of food products 
and development of regulations for safe production activity and 
habitation will enable protection of the health of the populace 
in regions hit by the Chernobyl disaster. 
  12. The operation of local centers in Brestskaya and 
Gomelskaya Oblasts has revealed considerable contamination of 
food products in centers of population of Belorussian Polesye, 
especially milk, cranberries and wild fruit at contamination 
density of less than 37 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Clean milk cannot be 
produced even at a contamination density by cesium- 137 of 
18.5-25.9 kBq/m[.sup]2[/]. Haste must be made in cultivating 
and improving natural grasslands, and respecialization of 
agricultural enterprises. 
  13. Laws of the Belarus Republic "On Social Protection of 
Citizens Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster" and "On the Legal 
Status of Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination as 
a Result of the Chernobyl Disaster," the first legislative acts, 
are running up against considerable financial difficulties in 
their implementation; assistance of republics of the former USSR 
has practically stopped, especially in convalescence of more 
than 580,000 children. 
  Considering the limited capabilities of Belarus in 
sanatorium 
and health resort facilities for convalescence of children 
(70,000 a year), an immediate task is to set up a 
sanitorium-convalescence base in the republic for 
300,000-500,000 children. Priority and long-term plans should 
include setting up children's year-round 
sanitorium-convalescence centers in clean regions of Belarus 
with incorporation of foreign investments, offering tax 
privileges for such centers and their founders. 
  14. In connection with the scarcity of reliable data in 
world 
science about the effect of low doses of radiation andthe 
no-threshold effect of radiation on man, and passage of new 
recommendations by the International Commission on Radiation 
Protection in November 1990 with appreciably lower limits of 
radiation doses for professionals of less than 20 mSv per year 
(formerly 50 mSv per year) and for the populace of less than 1 
mSv per year (formerly 5 mSv per year), particular attention in 
the republic must be given to minimizing the collective dose of 
irradiation, more precisely determining the effect of low doses 
of irradiation on healthy populations, especially for 
radiosensitive critical groups (a list of 34 illnesses is given 
in NRB-76/87), and working out effective measures for the 
population on territories with contamination density of not only 
555-1480 kBq/m[.sup]2[/] and 185- 555 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], but 
also with contamination density of 37-185 kBq/m[.sup]2[/], 
where the effective equivalent dose exceeds 1 mSv per year.

  [Text] Conclusion 
  Comprehensive mathematical analysis of medical-demographic 
indices in conjunction with characteristics of radiation 
contamination in various regions of Russia has yielded a wealth 
of possibilities for both analysis itself, and for the general 
procedural approach to assessment of the interrelationship 
between health of the populace and radiation impact that has 
been developed as the conceptual base of this analysis. The most 
important result of this work is mathematically confident 
establishment of a direct connection between morbidity and the 
radiation factor on territory with low doses of external 
irradiation. In a broader view, it is a matter of undoubted 
radiation causality of many illnesses of the populace in regions 
of ``Russian Chernobyl.'' At the same time, the discovered 
causality is complicated, and cannot be given any unambiguous 
interpretation in only one direction, positive or negative. Some 
illnesses are typified by decreased incidence with time, and 
improvement of the state of health with respect to given 
illnesses (pneumonia, rheumatism), while others show an increase 
(myocardial ischemia, cerebral illnesses, diabetes and so on) 
for the same radiation conditions. It is important to recognize 
that the general direction of change of morbidity, or the 
overall direction of the change in state of health of residents 
of ``Russian Chernobyl'' unfortunately is negative. This is 
confirmed by the fact of an increase in morbidity, although some 
stabilization, or rather a trend toward stabilization, is noted 
in 1991. There is a lot of work remaining in ascertainment of 
the mechanisms of radiation causality of illnesses, 
reconstruction of the initially received dose of radiation, 
further analysis of discovered facts of ``splitting'' of 
illnesses into two (``+'' and ``-'') groups and much more. 
Perhaps the developed methodology and practice of the 
comprehensive approach will enable more rapid and rational 
advancement in solution of the formulated problems. 
  The problem of the interrelationship between morbidity and 
low doses of chronic radiation exposure is not only of 
considerable theoretical significance, but is also of 
considerable practical importance for the fates of people taking 
part in cleanup of the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric 
Power Plant. A large detachment of Russian volunteer miners from 
Tulskaya Oblast worked on driving a tunnel beneath the exploded 
reactor of the fourth power generating unit at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant. After receiving considerable unaccounted- 
for doses of irradiation, the miners returned to their permanent 
residences in various regions of Tulskaya Oblast (as well as 
Orlovskaya, Kurskaya, Lipetskaya and other oblasts), where the 
contamination density usually does not exceed 5-10 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. According to traditional concepts rooted in 
radiobiology, these densities of fallout of radionuclides 
cesium-137 (and, correspondingly, strontium-90) are 
insignificant, and they cannot form appreciable doses of 
external and internal irradiation. This was indeed the position 
of experts of the International Chernobyl Committee. However, 
this leaves out many factors. First of all, the cleanup men who 
received large doses are still living in this same Tulskaya 
Oblast for the seventh year along with the native population 
(who likewise received certain doses) under conditions of low 
but CHRONIC constant irradiation acting on an organism that had 
already experienced dose burdens in 1986. Some food products, 
especially in homes, are still contaminated. Residents are not 
receiving any supplemental food products rich in protein and 
vitamins. There is no qualified medical assistance or systematic 
observation and monitoring of the health of the population 
(including cleanup workers) in regions of both Tulskaya Oblast 
and other middle Russian oblasts. Under these conditions, the 
possibility of existence of danger must unconditionally be given 
top priority, and the impact of low doses of chronic exposure 
must be taken into account as a risk factor, and not 
deliberately discarded as insignificant, especially as regards 
cleanup personnel still living in contaminated regions. 
  We have already spoken of the inadequacies of Russian 
legislation in the field of social compensation, which to a 
considerable extent is due to the serious economic situation of 
the country. But no less important are the stereotypes that have 
evolved concerning the harmlessness of low doses of irradiation. 
Thanks to these notions, the ``Russian Chernobyl'' of 15 regions 
did not exist, as it were, for 5 years, and it is only within 
the last 1.5-2 years that work has begun on scientific 
investigation of various aspects of the Russian Chernobyl 
problem area. We would hope that this expert conclusion, as all 
publications of ``Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster'' that 
apply to the indivisible Chernobyl region of Russia, Ukraine and 
Belarus, will draw attention of the public and of government 
agencies of CIS nations to the need for increased activity in 
work on Chernobyl, once more uniting the efforts of scientists 
and specialists in solving a crucial problem of our time. 
  General Findings 
  The data given above show that in the near future there must 
be a drastic increase in activity on studying contaminated 
territories of the Russian Chernobyl. There is work to be done 
on development, comprehensive discussion and acceptance of a 
government program for organizing a permanently operating 
monitoring service in each region of Russia that has been 
subjected to radiation contamination. 
  I. The expert proposals set forth below on further 
investigation of radiation conditions in Russia are aimed at 
significantly increasing the extent of radioecological coverage 
of the territory, and developing practical measures for 
alleviating the radiation situation. 
  1. A proposal for aerophotographic-spectral surveys of 
radioactive contamination of the locality in the European part 
of Russia as a result of the Chernobyl accident includes: 
  -surveys of previously unstudied territories on a scale of 
1:1,000,000: 
  Volgogradskaya Oblast; Kalmykia; Saratovskaya Oblast 
(right-bank regions of the Volga); Nenets Province; 
  -a detailed examination of regions with elevated levels of 
reserve of cesium-137 revealed as a result of work in 1991 on a 
total area of 72,400 km[.sup]2[/] (Penzenskaya, Ulyanovskaya, 
Saratovskaya and Novgordskaya Oblasts, and Mordovia). 
  2. Tracing Chernobyl contamination on the territory of 
Siberia by aerophotographic spectral surveys on a scale of 
1:5,000,000. 
  3. Setting up a computer database on radioactive 
contamination and fallout of chemical products. 
  4. Publishing maps of radioactive and chemical contamination 
in the first and second quarters of 1993. 
  5. Producing maps of chemical contamination for territories 
where zones of radioactive contamination due to the Chernobyl 
accident have been observed. This will enable an integrated 
approach to assessments of the synergic (combined) effect of 
anthropogenic contaminants on man. 
  II. Analysis of social aspects of migration of the 
population 
in radioactively contaminated regions of Russia, Belarus and 
Ukraine suggests several general conclusions and some specific 
forecasts relative to regions of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' 
  1. A study of the demographic situation in its various 
aspects should be considered a component of the assessment of 
long-term consequences of the Chernobyl accident, while 
demographic forecasts should be one of the possible guidelines 
of the outlook for development of the region. 
  2. In the near future, the demographic, economic, 
psychological and political situation in the disaster zone, 
especially including regions of Russia, will be determined to a 
great extent by migration of the population. Efflux of the 
population from rural localities and municipal settlements 
constitutes the principal features of this migration. 
  3. Consequences of the efflux are important not just from 
the 
standpoint of future development of the regions themselves, but 
also for the fate of several tens of thousands, and possible 
even hundreds of thousands of people migrating ``at their own 
peril and risk.'' This is essentially an open form of forced 
migration, and the population taking part in this process should 
rightfully be considered ecological refugees with corresponding 
rights to housing in regions of lodging. A significant part must 
be played by regions of Russia to which a flow of refugees is 
coming from Belarus and Ukarine. 
  4. The scales of consequences of the migration go beyond the 
confines of the region directly affected by the accident. The 
large specific weight of movements between republics, especially 
to Russia, confirms conclusions about the global nature, the 
proliferation of consequences of the disaster, rather than 
localization, as oficially expressed. In this connection, the 
problem arises of forming reserve funds for building refugee 
housing and developing a public health system. Appropriate 
intergovernmental agreements are needed on arranging employment 
for refugees. 
  5. Despite regional differences, it is by natural migration 
that the populace is resolving the severe contradictions 
existing since 1986. Trends of migration evidence poor 
effectiveness of stabilization by compensatory measures directed 
at alleviating the consequences of the disaster, especially in 
the region of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' Therefore, the forecast 
of migration subsumes at least two scenarios. According to the 
first, the traditionally inertial scenario, events will occur in 
accordance with the system set forth above. The second scenario 
presumes an effective policy of compensations capable of 
stabilizing the situation, and especially for the forthcoming 
process of migration to the Russian Federation. The uniqueness 
of the situation that has arisen as a result of the break of 
economic ties and administrative structures of the former USSR, 
there is no great optimism relative to the second scenario. 
Nevertheless, implementation of new social guidelines of the 
development of society should include as a priority a truly 
effective and coordinated social policy in regions affected by 
the Chernobyl disaster. 
  III. The consensus on results of expert work in assessing 
the 
state of health of the populace in the ``Russian Chernobyl'' 
subregion is set forth in the Conclusion of the corresponding 
section. Therefore, we will limit ourselves here to a few of the 
most pertinent conclusions drawn from development of a general 
procedural approach and comprehensive multivariate statistical 
analysis of medical demographic indicators and radioecological 
factors of the habitat of the populace in radioactively 
contaminated regions. 
  1. Contingent of people subjected to the action of radiation 
and residing on various territories differ significantly in the 
structure of morbidity. Ecological factors of the regions on the 
whole have a noticeable effect on the state of health of the 
populace residing there. 
  2. In regions with an elevated level of radiation 
contamination, there is a considerable change in the structure 
of morbidity due to an increase in the percentage of rare 
illnesses: in regions of the Chernobyl zone as a whole, there is 
a dramatic increase in the incidence (double or triple) of 
diseases that are virtually not seen in Moscow. 
  3. Based on the example of Tulskaya Oblast, trustworthy dose 
dependences have been discovered between morbidity and degree of 
radiation contamination of regions, which serves as direct proof 
of radiation causality of some illnesses. 
  4. Analysis of the dynamics of morbidity has revealed a 
genuine change of morbidity with respect to a number of separate 
nosological units both toward an increase, and toward a decrease. 
  5. The dynamics of the integral measure of deviation of 
morbidity with respect to the totality of nosological units from 
the initial (1985) state is markedly nonlinear. An assessment of 
the direction of these changes shows that they are negative on 
the whole: in the period following 1986, there is an increase in 
morbidity, especially dramatic in 1986-1988, with some reduction 
of the increase in morbidity and stabilization in 1990. 
  6. ``Splitting'' of the totality of illnesses into a group 
with positive dynamics and a group with negative dynamics is 
consistent with the concept of integrated action of factors of 
the habitat on the organism as a hierarchical structure of 
mutually regulated subsystems, and may serve as an argument 
supporting this concept. 
  7. The time dependence of the integral index of 
directionality of correlations between different illnesses shows 
extremum behavior. The position of the maximum in 1986-1987 
gives evidence of the important contribution of the radiation 
component to the observed changes of morbidity. 
  8. Our approach allows an integral assessment of the state 
of 
health of the population of regions, tracking of dynamics, and 
establishment of a relation between the state of health and the 
degree of radiation contamination, which opens the way to 
demarcation of territories of elevated risk and development of 
purposeful and effective protective measures.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan possesses a developed electric power 
system which fully meets the needs of the republic's economy for 
electric power and which transmits one-third of its production 
to the consolidated power grid of Central Asia and southern 
Kazakhstan. 
  The power system incorporates 20 power stations with a total 
installed capacity of 3,384 MW including 18 hydroelectric plants 
(2,710 MW) and two heat and power plants in Bishkek and Osh (674 
MW). Other large power stations are the Toktogul hydroelectric 
plant (1,200 MW), Kurpsay hydroelectric plant (800 MW), Bishkek 
heat and power plant (624 MW), Tash-Kumyr hydroelectric plant 
(450 MW), and Uch-Kurgan hydroelectric plant (180 MW).

  The power system's electric networks contain 500-kV aerial 
power transmission lines (VL) extending 541 km, 1,009 km of 
220-kV lines, 4,301 km of 110-kV lines, and 4,172 km of 35-kV 
lines and more than 60,000 km of 10-0.4-kV distribution lines. 
There are 481 35-500-kV step-down transformer substations with a 
total capacity of 7,787 MVA. 
  The power system is involved in central heat supply in the 
cities of Bishkek, Osh, Kara-Kol, Kyzyl-Kiya, and Kara-Kul. The 
total length of thermal networks is 460 km. The power system's 
heat sources annually produce 5,500-5,700 thousand Gcal or 
39% 
of the thermal energy consumed in the republic. 
  In 1992, the power system generated 12.1 billion kWh of 
electric power of which 9.4 billion were at hydroelectric plants 
and 2.7 billion--at heat and power stations. Furthermore, the 
electric power consumption by the economy and population of the 
Kyrgyzstan republic amounted to 9.7 billion kWh, while 6 billion 
kWh were supplied to the consolidated power grid (OES) and the 
People's Republic of China. On the other hand, 3.6 billion kWh 
were received from the consolidated power grid resulting in a 
transfer balance of 2.4 billion kWh.

  The industry is switching to new economic management 
conditions in a difficult situation which is typical of the 
economy as a whole. The principal problem which complicates 
execution of the campaign is the objective need for periodically 
increasing the electric and heat power rates. The difficult user 
adaptation to the new pricing policy and their financial 
insolvency and a lack of a clearly defined economic and legal 
framework for governing the relations among the producers and 
consumers of energy cause instability in the electric power 
industry performance. 
  The principal factors which determine the trends, scale, and 
pace of the electric power system development are as follows: 
  availability of the energy resources converted to electric 
and thermal power; 
  meeting the economy's requirements for electric and thermal 
power for domestic need and export; and 
  financing and physical base support of capital construction 
and overhaul of electric power industry installations. 
  Hydroelectric power resources are the backbone for 
developing 
the electric power base of Kyrgyzstan. According to geological 
survey data, the total hydroelectric power potential of rivers 
in the Kyrgyzstan republic reaches 142.5 billion kWh.

  According to analyses by the Gidroproyekt Hydroelectric 
Power 
Plant Design Institute, a total of 95 hydroelectric power plants 
with a total capacity of 11,350 MW and an average multiyear 
generation of 49.8 billion kWh may be built on Kyrgyzstan rivers. 
  At today's development stage, only 9% of 
hydroelectric 
resources have been mastered. Hydroelectric power construction 
is carried out primarily on the Naryn River. The development of 
the electric power industry in the foreseeable future is 
associated with mastering this river and its tributaries. 
  The plans for the power utilization of Kyrgyzstan rivers 
have 
been developed in sufficient detail, and today, there are 
several versions of hydroelectric power construction with 
economic and technical feasibility. 
  A positive feature characterizing the development of 
hydroelectric power in Kyrgyzstan is the possibility of building 
hydroelectric power plant cascades which utilize more fully the 
river resources and increase the degree of control. 
  An optimization of the electric power plant development and 
siting made it possible to determine the most efficient ways of 
commissioning the generating capacities in the power system up 
to the year 2010 (Table 2). 
  After completion of the Lower Naryn hydroelectric power 
plant 
cascade, plans call for building five hydroelectric power plant 
cascades in the upper and midsections of the Naryn River and its 
tributaries which include 19 hydroelectric power plants with a 
5,400-MW power and a 16.8 billion kWh generation in 2010. 
  Construction of the GES-2 Kambartin hydroelectric power 
plant 
with a 360-MW capacity and 1.1 billion kWh/yr generation began 
in 1991. At the same time, preliminary work and construction of 
the Kambartin GES-1 hydroelectric power plant with a planned 
1,900-MW power and an annual electric power output of 4.5 
billion kWh have begun; it will be fully commissioned by 2005. 
Construction and commissioning of the Kambartin GES-3 
hydroelectric power plant with a planned power of 170 MW would 
be expedient in 1996-2005. Kambartin hydroelectric power plants 
will operate in a power mode since the availability of the 
Toktogul reservoir downstream frees them from any irrigation 
constraints. 
  Plans for 2001-2010 call for building the Ala-Bukin 
hydroelectric power plant with a 600-MW design power in the 
midsection of the Naryn River and the Kara-Bulun plant with a 
120-MW power in 2006-2010. 
  Preparatory work on the Upper Naryn hydroelectric power 
plant 
cascade will begin in 1993 while construction of the principal 
structures--in 1995 with subsequent commissioning of five 
hydroelectric power plants in the cascade before 2005 with a 
total power of 291 MW. 
  The republic's small hydroelectric power plants could make a 
significant contribution to electric power generation. The total 
hydroelectric power potential of small rivers with rates of flow 
between 0.7 and 50 m[.sup]3[/]/s is estimated as 7.0 billion 
kWh/yr. Its utilization will make it possible to supply electric 
power to installations in distant pastures and for highland 
agriculture. 
  Today, only 3% of the possible hydroelectric 
resources of 
small rivers have been utilized in the republic. The irrigation 
reservoir and numerous canal and river resources are not being 
utilized for generating electric power. In order to accelerate 
the development of small-scale hydroelectric industry in the 
republic, plans call for building new and rebuilding small 
hydroelectric power plants with a total power of 178 MW and 
annual production of approximately 0.5 billion kWh.

  The above electric power plant development strategy will 
enable Kyrgyzstan to become a large producer of electric power 
at the turn of the century. 
  Moreover, electric power generation and the electric power 
plant capacity will double and reach 25.6 billion kWh and 7,800 
MW, respectively. 
  Gas-fired 720-MW TETs-2 heat and power generating plants 
will 
be constructed in Bishkek before 2010 in order to meet the 
demand for thermal and electric power, and first phase 
generating capacities--a peak load boiler--will be commissioned 
prior to 1994. The first generating unit with a 180-MW power 
will be commissioned in 1997. 
  Given the proposed electric power production and 
distribution 
scope, subsequent electric power supply system development for 
meeting the electric power requirements will become an important 
link in the power system. 
  The development of 220-500 kV electric networks will be 
dictated by the need to enhance electric power supply to the 
developing industrial centers, agricultural facilities, and 
municipal and domestic users in the need to accommodate 
generating capacities of the new large power plants. 
  The principal network installations to be built during 
1995-2010 include a 500-kV transmission line with the following 
500-kV substations (PS): the Kambartin hydroelectric power plant 
with the Kemin substation, the Kambartin hydroelectric power 
plant with the Kyrgyz substation in Osh oblast, and the Frunze 
substation with the Kemin substation which are used both to 
distribution power from the Kambartin hydroelectric power plants 
and for enhancing the links between the southern and northern 
parts of the power system. 
  The scope of the network construction and overhaul up to the 
year 2010 allowing that the planned hydroelectric power plants 
will generate power are summarized in Table 4. 
  The electric power distribution in the republic during 
1992-2010 will continue to utilize the formula 110/35/10-6/0.4 
and 110/10-6/0.4 kV. 
  Electrification is regarded as one of the objectives and an 
important means of implementing Kyrgyzstan's new energy policy. 
  The primary goal of its subsequent accelerated development 
is 
to maximize participation in standardizing and then subsequently 
greater improving the living conditions of the population. This 
will call for expanding the use of electric power in everyday 
life and the sphere of social services. 
  The second objective of accelerating the development of 
electrification is to enhance its participation in increasing 
the production sphere efficiency and increasing the national 
economic resources which result in invigorating the republic's 
economy. 
  It is expected that industrial electric power consumption 
will continue to decrease in 1993-1994; in addition to the 
declining volume of electric power generation, a continuing 
increase in the electric power cost which stimulates an increase 
in the electric power consumption efficiency will also have 
their impact. The economy is expected to pick up eventually, and 
some of it will be due to an increase in the electric 
power-to-worker ratio which will lead to an increase in electric 
power consumption. Nevertheless, a rather moderate rate of 
industrial electric power consumption growth is predicted 
allowing for energy conservation. Furthermore, the proportion of 
industry in the total electric power demand will decrease from 
37.2% in 1992 to 29% in 2005. 
  Roughly the same trends will characterize the electric power 
consumption for agricultural needs. At the level of 2,000, this 
category of users will consume one-fifth of the total electric 
power demand in the republic. 
  The anticipated substantial shifts in the electric power 
consumption structure will occur due to a deliberate accelerated 
development of electrification of the daily life of the 
population by implementing energy-intensive heating appliances 
in residences. A stage-by-stage increase in the number of such 
heating appliances will be responsible for an increase in the 
proportion of domestic thermal processes in the total electric 
power consumption of up to 20-30% after 2000. At the same 
time, 
the electric power consumption for traditional household needs 
will also increase. This electric power consumption is 
tentatively estimated as 11.8 billion kWh in 1995 and 17.4 
billion kWh in 2000.

<F P=106> [Article by A.I. Kulikov, Ya.A. Kovylanskiy, Poisk </F>
Scientific Production Company and State Enterprise of the 
National Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power 
Industry, Moscow] 
  [Text] The total production of the fuel and energy 
resources in 1990-1992 declined primarily due to a decrease in 
the coal and oil production. The lack of technical readiness to 
extract oil from the ground using more complicated practices 
precludes attempts at stabilizing or even increasing somewhat 
the oil production in the next 30-40 years. Coal production will 
increase yet it will be utilized primarily near the mining 
locations--in Russia's eastern regions--due to the difficulty of 
delivering it to the western regions. An increase in the gas 
production should be treated as an important yet 
difficult-to-meet goal. The planned nuclear power development 
scale would hardly make it possible to complete Russia's fuel 
balance. 
  Such a situation necessitates a search for new energy 
sources. In recent decades, scientists in Russia and abroad 
focused attention on the possibility of utilizing the heat 
released during the splitting of the so-called 
high-molecular silicates 
M[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]_x_SiO[.sub]2[/] type, where M=Na 
or K and _x_=3 or 4, e.g., the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] silicate. In this 
case, anhydrous silicon compounds of the SiR type, where R=C or 
N may serve as the splitting substance, e.g., a mixture of 
silicon carbide and nitride SiC + Si[.sup]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. 
  The fission process may occur in two ways: the first is the 
conventional chemical reaction which is characterized 
by the interaction of material particles; the 
second--physical-chemical chain reaction--which is 
determined by the level of the material-energy reaction chains. 
A chain reaction may develop only in the case where the energy 
released during the occurrence of the preceding reaction is 
sufficient to start the next one. Academician A.N. Semenov 
characterized these type of reactions as the development of a 
chain process by means of energy chains. 
  The fission process occurs until the development of the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] low-modulus 
silicate and CO and SiO carbon and silicon monoxide. According 
to the general theory of chain reactions, the presence of active 
silicate complexes and energy chains alone is insufficient to 
ensure a chain process. The crucial feature is the presence of 
the so-called critical mass of the silicate. Not all 
silicates can break up by the chain mechanism. In a number of 
silicates, the necessary initial energy in the initial state is 
consolidated only partially, so it must be additionally 
consolidated artificially from the initial substances. For 
example, in producing the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] silicate from the 
original products, i.e., sodium carbonate and sand: 
  (1)Na[.sup]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/] + 3SiO[.sub]2[/] = 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
CO[.sup]2[/]. 
  This process is widely known and is utilized in the 
glass-making industry. 
  The quantity of energy released during fission is calculated 
from the following formula [1, 2] 
  (2)Q = 
k[.sup]i[/][.sup].[/]10[.sup]3n[/], 
  where k is the indicator of the fuel type and 
purity and n is the coefficient of the chain reaction 
order; for the hydration process, n = 0, for a 
chemical reaction, n = 1, for a physical-chemical 
reaction, n = 2, for a nuclear reaction, n 
= 3, and for a fusion reaction, n = 4. 
  Analyses show that in the course of a purely chemical 
decomposition reaction, 1 kg of silicate releases 3,350 cal of 
heat [2], which is the same as Ekibastuz coal, while in a chain 
physical-chemical reaction, it releases 8.5 million kcal, i.e., 
in this case, it may replace 1,000 t of fuel oil. 
  Physical-chemical silicate chain reactions amount to a phase 
transformation during the process. At first, the high-modulus 
silicate is in the solid phase. To trigger its decomposition 
process, it is necessary to supply a relatively small quantity 
of initial energy from outside. As a result, it will be 
partially converted to the liquid phase, and the chain reaction 
will begin to develop. 
  Given a total transition of the critical silicate mass to 
the 
liquid state, reaction byproducts and energy are released 
abruptly (at a rate of an explosion). One can retard the energy 
release only by adding to the molten silicate mass special rods 
from anhydrous silicate compounds and withdrawing them. 
Insertion of the rods increases the energy chain multiplication 
factor, while their withdrawal decreases it. 
  The energy released in the devices as a result of the 
high-modulus silicate splitting under the effect of anhydrous 
silicon compounds may be broadly utilized virtually in all 
branches of the national economy with the help of a conventional 
heat exchange circuit using well-known designs. The gain from 
the transition to silicate fuel is indisputable. For example, we 
know that 39 t of liquid fuel are pumped into the tanks of the 
TU-154 airplane, yet the same energy can be derived from 39 kg 
of silicate. 
  Silicate fuel is inexpensive, and approximately 1.5 million 
t 
of it is produced annually in Russia. In the power industry, 
silicate power plants could be installed in place of boiler 
plants at thermal electric power plants and large boiler rooms. 
This is a new environmentally clean type of fuel, which is 
especially desirable for heat and power generating plants with a 
combined heat and electricity production as well as large urban 
boiler rooms located in residential construction and suburban 
areas. 
  The high-modulus silicate decay products, i.e., CO and SiO, 
are not discharged into the atmosphere but are forwarded to a 
special recovery module. In this module, carbon monoxide is 
converted to carbon dioxide, while silicon monoxide--into 
silicon dioxide. These substances are used for silicate recovery: 
  (3)Na[.sup]2[/])[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
2SiO[.sup]2[/] = 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/]. 
  The thermal pollution of the atmosphere is also greatly 
decreased, i.e., 
  Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
2SiO[.sup]2[/] = Na [sic] 



  A schematic diagram of a power plant with a gaseous energy 
source is shown in the figure. In contrast to boiler furnaces, 
heat transfer in the water wall tubes is realized due to heat 
transfer from the more-heated medium to the less-heated medium 
through the pipe walls rather than due to radiative transport 
from the fuel combustion flare. 
  Silicate power engineering is still in its infancy. Today, 
the State Association of the National Scientific Research and 
Design Institute of Power Industry together with the Energy 
Physics Institute (Obninsk) and the Gidropress Special Hydraulic 
Press Design Office (Podolsk) are developing the design of a 
pilot silicate power plant with a 25 MW power with 6 MPa and 
275ÎC heat transfer agent parameters. Shop drawings of the 
pilot-commercial power plant using the new energy source have 
been prepared and its assembly is in the finishing stages.

<F P=106> [Text of "Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties </F>
in Russian Federation"; first paragraph is italic SELEKTSIYA I 
SEMENOVODSTVO introduction] 
  [Text] We are presenting 
for your attention the "Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant 
Varieties in Russian Federation," which has been approved by the 
Ministry of Agriculture. It was developed with consideration for 
the concept of the draft of the ``Law Regarding Selection 
Improvements Whose Adoption Is Eagerly Awaited by Breeders.'' In 
view of the fact that some genera and species of agricultural 
crops will not be subject to the Law for a certain period, the 
Statute published here will regulate relations arising during 
the creation and use of new varieties of these crops. 
<H3>  Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties in the 
Russian Federation </H3>
  This Statute specifies the procedure for government testing 
of plant varieties for the purpose of scientifically 
substantiated formation of the variety resources of the Russian 
Federation and regulates relations arising in connection with 
the creation and use of new varieties. 
  The Statute is in effect until the passage and effective 
date 
of the Russian Federation Law Regarding Selection Improvements. 
<H5>  I. General Provisions </H5>
  1.1. Government tests of new varieties, hybrids, and lines 
of 
agricultural crops and other cultivated plants and silkworm 
breeds and hybrids (henceforth referred to as varieties) are 
conducted by the All-Russian State Commission on Agricultural 
Crop Variety Testing (henceforth referred to as the 
Gossortkomissiya) through the following: 

  -  republic, kray, and oblast inspectors to test varieties of 
agricultural crops (henceforth referred to as inspectors); 
  -  government variety-testing stations (henceforth referred to 
as 
gossortstantsii); 
  -  government variety-testing sections located on an independent 
balance sheet or organizational variety-testing sections on a 
contractual basis in agricultural enterprises under different 
forms of ownership (henceforth referred to as gossortouchastki); 
  -  the All-Russia Center for Quality Evaluation of Agricultural 
Crop Varieties [VTsOKS]; 
  -  regional chemical technology laboratories (henceforth 
referred 
to as laboratories); 
  -  other organizations on a contractual basis. 

    1.2. The Gossortkomissiya, in accordance with this Statute, 
will assume the examination of variety applications, conduct an 
expert examination of them and test the varieties, manage the 
State Register of Varieties Authorized for Use in Production in 
the Corresponding Region of the Russian Federation (henceforth 
referred to as the State Register), issue certificates and 
authorship certificates, publish rules clarifying the use of 
this Statute and the government's variety-testing method, 
publish official information, and perform other functions in 
accordance with the applicable statutes. 
  1.3. Inclusion of a variety in the State Register grants the 
right to reproduce, import, and sell seeds and plant material of 
a variety in territories of the republics, krays, and oblasts of 
a respective region. Crops of these varieties are subjected to 
testing, and variety documents are issued for them. 
  Reproduction of seeds and plant material of a variety for 
purposes of their export beyond the confines of its respective 
region does not require inclusion of the variety in the State 
Register for the given region. 
  1.4. For a variety included in the State Register, the 
Gossortkomissiya issues a certificate to the applicant and an 
authorship certificate to the developer. 
  1.5. State testing of plant varieties is financed with the 
resources of the republic budget of the Russian Federation. 
<H5>  II. The State Register </H5>
  2.1. The State Register includes varieties permitted for use 
during that year in the respective region of the Russian 
Federation (Appendix). 
  2.2. In the case of crops on the list specified by the 
Gossortkomissiya, inclusion of varieties in the State Register 
is based on government tests; in the case of all other crops, 
inclusion is based on expert evaluations or studies conducted by 
the applicant. 
  Varieties regionalized in the Russian Federation as of the 
approval date of this Statute are included in the State Register 
de facto. 
  2.3. The following varieties are excluded from the State 
Register of Varieties: 
varieties that have lost their agricultural value, homogeneity, 
or stability; 
seeds (plant material) that are not in demand and have not been 
used in the production of the respective region for the past 5 
years. 
  2.4. When the reasons prompting exclusion of a variety from 
the State Register have been eliminated, the originator has the 
right to send the Gossortkomissiya a petition requesting that 
the variety be reinstated in the State Register after the 
appropriate tests. 
  2.5. Revisions in the State Register and lists of the 
following are approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Agriculture upon the recommendation of the Gossortkomissiya: 

  -  varieties of hardy wheat; 
  -  varieties of grain, cereal, and leguminous crops that are 
valuable from a quality standpoint; 
  -  varieties of brewing barley; 
  -  high-oil varieties of sunflower; 
  -  erucic acid-free and low-glucosinolate varieties of rape and 
summer rape. 

<H5>    III. The Certificate </H5>
  3.1. The certificate certifies the originator of the variety 
and grants him the right to conclude agreements to produce the 
seeds (plant material) and sell them, as well as to otherwise 
introduce the variety into economic circulation in accordance 
with the State Register. 
  In the event that a certificate for a variety is issued to 
several applicants who have jointly created the variety, the 
relationships regarding use of the variety in production is 
regulated by an agreement among them. 
  3.2. A certificate shall remain in effect for 20 years from 
the date of its issue. In the case of grapes and decorative and 
fruit tree varieties, including their rootstock, this period 
shall constitute 25 years. 
  3.3. The holder of a certificate is obliged to maintain the 
variety so as to preserve the traits specified in the 
description of the variety on the priority date, its 
homogeneity, and its stability and is, upon the request of the 
Gossortkomissiya, obliged to send them at his own expense seeds 
of the variety for check tests and to permit on-site inspections 
when necessary. 
<H5>  IV. The Authorship Certificate </H5>
  4.1. The authorship certificate certifies the authorship of 
a 
variety and priority and grants the developer the right to 
receive authorship royalties from the holder of the certificate 
based on an agreement with him for as long as funds are received 
as a result of use of the variety in production. 
  The royalties to a team of developers are distributed in 
proportion to the extent of each developer's participation in 
creation of the variety. 
  4.2. The physical individual whose creative labor has either 
created or discovered a variety may be the developer of that 
variety. Disputes regarding authorship are resolved in a 
judicial procedure. 
  4.3. The period for which an authorship certificate remains 
in effect is unlimited. 
<H5>  V. Handling of an Application </H5>
  5.1. The breeder submits an application for inclusion of the 
variety in the State Register and issuance of a certificate and 
authorship certificate to the Gossortkomissiya. In the case of a 
variety created while the breeder is performing his job or job 
duties, the application is submitted by the originating 
institution. 
  5.2. The application should include the following: 

  -  a request to have the variety included in the State 
Register for the corresponding region and to issue a certificate 
and authorship certificate; 
  -  a description of the variety with its proposed name; 
  -  information regarding the creative participation of each of 
the 
developers of the new variety that has been signed by all of the 
developers; 
  -  the obligation to provide the required amount of seeds (plant 
material) of the variety free of charge. 

    The documents of the application should be provided in 
Russian in accordance with the form established by the 
Gossortkomissiya. 
  5.3. If the applicant is an originating institution, the 
presence of an agreement with the developer of the variety 
should be indicated in the application. 
  5.4. An applicant has the right to priority of first 
application 12 months from the date of receipt of the first 
application by another government. 
  In this case, the applicant should indicate the date of 
priority of first application in the application sent to the 
Gossortkomissiya, and within 6 months of the date of receipt of 
the application, he should present the Gossortkomissiya with a 
copy of the first application verified by a competent agency of 
the respective government along with a Russian translation of it. 
  5.5. In order for government tests of a variety to be 
conducted during the next growing season, an application must be 
received no later than the date established by the 
Gossortkomissiya. 
<H5>  VI. Naming of a Variety </H5>
  6.1. The variety is given the name proposed by the applicant 
and approved by the Gossortkomissiya. 
  6.2. The name of a variety should make it possible to 
identify the variety, be brief, and be different from any other 
name of an existing variety or closely related botanical 
species. The name must not consist of numbers alone; it must not 
contradict the principles of public morals; and it must not lead 
to confusion regarding the nature of the properties, origin, and 
significance of the variety or the identity of the breeder. 
  6.3. The name of a variety should be the same in the event 
that applications for its registration are submitted to the 
Russian Federation and other governments. 
  6.4. A name not meeting the requirements in items 6.2 and 
6.3 
must, upon the recommendation of the Gossortkomissiya, be 
changed within the specified time period. 
<H5>  VII. Expert Examination of an Application </H5>
  7.1. The Gossortkomissiya will conduct its expert 
examination 
within a month. The priority date is established, and the 
documents submitted with the application are checked for their 
conformity to the stipulated requirements. 
  7.2. The Gossortkomissiya may request missing documents or 
verifying materials, which the applicant is obliged to provide 
in the established time period. The application is not 
considered otherwise, and the applicant is informed of this fact. 
  7.3. In the event of an affirmative decision, the applicant 
is informed that his variety has been accepted for government 
testing or that an expert examination of the variety has been 
set. In the case of varieties demonstrating clearly 
unsatisfactory results in the applicant's field tests, the 
application is rejected. 
<H5>  VIII. Government Tests </H5>
  8.1. The government testing includes the following: 

  -  a biological-economic evaluation of the variety at 
government variety-testing stations and sections in the region; 
  -  an immunologic evaluation at special government 
variety-testing 
sections; 
  -  a quality evaluation at the All-Russia Center for Quality 
Evaluation of Agricultural Crop Varieties, laboratories, and 
other organizations. 

    8.2. Seeds (plant material) and specimens of new varieties 
for government testing are supplied at the originator's expense. 
  Seeds (plant material) included in the State Register of 
Varieties and used as standards in the experiments entailed in 
government variety testing are paid for by the 
recipient-inspector. 
  8.3. Government tests are conducted as follows: 

  -  in the case of single-year crops, for up to 3 years; 
  -  in the case of multiple-year crops, for two use cycles; 
  -  in the case of multiple-year arboreal varieties, for up to 
four 
agricultural harvests. 

    In individual cases, the period of government regional

  [Text]The influenza epidemics in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990 are 
characterized according to age groups. It was shown that two of 
the six epidemics were caused by serotype B influenza viruses 
and four, by influenza A virus. 
  Influenza and ORZ [acute respiratory diseases] strike 
primarily the child population. For this reason, it is 
imperative to improve registration of incidence of ORVI [acute 
respiratory viral infection] in children. The lack of such 
registration makes it difficult to pinpoint promptly the start 
of a flu epidemic due to their small share of the overall 
population. For this reason, we kept a differentiated record of 
incidence of influenza and ORZ in different age groups during 
the flue epidemic in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990. 
  In 1985, an epidemic rise in incidence of influenza among 
children began in the 46th week of the year (11-17 November) in 
the 3-6 year age group. The following week (18-24 November) the 
epidemic threshold was exceeded by morbidity among 
schoolchildren 7-14 years old with a high rate of rise (to 40.3 
percent). The epidemic flu outbreak among children was 
characterized by low intensity, and it lasted for 6 weeks. In 
this period, morbidity constituted 5.2 percent for children in 
the 3-6 year age group, and 1.9 percent for children 7-14 years 
old, which was not appreciably reflected in the incidence of 
influenza in the adult population (Table 1).

  Within the epidemic period a total of 80 nasopharyngeal 
washings and 71 paired serum samples from patients with the 
diagnosis of influenza and acute respiratory disease were 
examined. Two strains of influenza virus were isolated from 
material from a sick 3-year old child and 59-year adult; 
identification with prototype sera revealed that they were of 
the sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza virus. Immunological analysis 
carried out with a large set of immune rat serum samples 
revealed that they were closely related to the drift variant 
A/Chile/1/83 (H1N1). HIT [hemagglutination inhibition tests] on 
paired patient serum samples revealed an increase in titers of 
antibodies to influenza virus A(H1N1) in 14.1 percent of the 
cases, to virus A(H3N2) in 5.6 percent, to virus B in 7.0 
percent, and mixed influenza infection in 9.9 percent. When the 
tested patients were distributed in age groups, influenza was 
diagnosed in 37.5 percent of the children 3-6 years old and 22.2 
percent in those 7-14 years old (Table 2).

  [Text]We noted an epidemic rise 
in incidence of influenza among Alma-Ata children 7-14 years old 
at an increment rate of 38.4 percent in the 5th week of 1986 (27 
January -- 2 February). One week later, children 3-6 years old 
were included in the epidemic process with an increment rate of 
41.4 percent. However, overall incidence of influenza among the 
entire population of the city remained below the epidemic 
threshold at this time. This indicator exceeded its limits only 
3 weeks after the start of the epidemic. The flu epidemic lasted 
7 weeks, and at its peak 0.9 percent of the population was 
stricken. In this period, 19.9 percent of preschool children 
were involved, 12.0 percent of schoolchildren and 1.3 percent of 
adults. As a result, over the entire epidemic, 4.7 percent of 
the city's inhabitants had contracted influenza (see Table 1). 
  As a result of virological tests performed in the first 
quarter of 1986, 3 strains of influenza virus B were isolated 
from 182 nasopharyngeal washings from patients (see Table 2). 
Two strains were isolated from children 21 months and 10 years 
old, and the third from a 34-year adult. The isolated strains 
were closely related according to antigenic structure of 
hemagglutinin to influenza virus B/Victoria/1/85, and they were 
characterized by loss of relationship to virus 
B/Singapore/222/79. Serological testing of paired serum samples 
from patients identified influenza B in 23.2 percent of the 
cases, A(H3N2) in 7.7 percent, and A(H1N1) in 1.6 percent. Mixed 
influenza infection was diagnosed in 4.1 percent. On the whole, 
influenza was demonstrated in 37.1 percent of the tested 
individuals. Serological testing of age groups revealed 
influenza in 21.2 percent of children up to 2 years old, 10.0 
percent in those 3-6 years of age, 46.6 percent of children 7-14 
years old, and 42.1 percent of adults. 
  In the 4th quarter of 1986, epidemic influenza in Alma-Ata 
was characterized by involvement of all age groups (see Table 
1). Rapid rates of increase in morbidity were recorded among 
schoolchildren (39.1 percent) and adults (35.1 percent). A 
dramatic rise in morbidity was noted in the 2d and 3d weeks 
after the start of the influenza epidemic. Peak epidemic 
morbidity occurred 2 weeks after onset of the epidemic in 
infants (0-2 years) and schoolchildren (7-14 years), whereas it 
occurred 3 weeks after the start in children 3-6 years old and 
adults. The flu epidemic lasted 6 weeks in the city. In this 
time, 2.1 percent of infants to 2 years old, 10.1 percent of 
3-6-year children, 10.3 percent of those 7-14 years old and 2.7 
percent of the adults had been stricken with the flu. Morbidity 
among children 3-14 years of age exceed that of adults by 3.8 
times during this flue epidemic. 
  A total of 176 patients were submitted to virological 
testing 
in order to make laboratory identification of the etiology of 
influenza during the epidemic. We isolated three strains of 
influenza virus A(H1N1) from children and one identical strain 
from an adult. According to antigenic structure of 
hemagglutinin, the epidemic viruses were closely related to the 
drift variant A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1). The hemagglutination 
neutralization test with antibody erythrocyte diagnosticum to 
strain A/Taiwan/1/86 showed that isolates interacted to a full 
homologous titer (1:5120), with A/Prague/1/84 to one-half titer, 
and to A/USSR/090/77 to one-eighth titer. Serologically, 
influenza A(H1N1) was demonstrated in 20.3 percent of those 
tested and mixed influenza infection was found in 3.2 percent. 
On the whole, influenza was diagnosed in 29.7 percent of the 
tested cases. 
  Thus, in the first and fourth quarters of 1986, there were 2 
flu epidemics in Alma-Ata, which were caused by serotype B and 
sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza viruses. The distinction of these 
epidemics was predominant involvement of preschool and school 
age children. 
  In the winter-spring period of 1987-1988, epidemic influenza 
morbidity in Alma-Ata had a two-wave course, and was 
characterized by dissimilar involvement of inhabitants in 
different age groups. At the start, in the 50th week of 1987 
(7-13 December), the epidemic threshold was exceeded by 
schoolchildren, and after 3 weeks preschool children were 
involved in the epidemic process. Among younger children, the 
epidemic lasted 5 weeks, and in this time 6.7 percent of the 
children up to 2 years old and 8.8 percent of those 3-6 years of 
age were stricken. The epidemic had a continuous pattern in 
children 7-14 years of age, and 15.6 percent of them were 
stricken. The distinction of this epidemic was the fact that the 
adult population of the city was virtually uninvolved in the 
epidemic process. On the whole, 2.5 percent of the inhabitants 
of Alma-Ata were stricken with influenza during the epidemic. 
  In the first wave of rise in incidence of influenza 
(December 
1987), we examined 159 nasopharyngeal washings from patients and 
isolated 2 strains of influenza virus B. HIT of 89 paired serum 
samples from stricken individuals revealed influenza B in 8.8 
percent of the cases, A(H1N1) in 3.5 percent, and A(H3N) in 2.2 
percent. In 10 percent of the cases, we diagnosed influenza 
infection of mixed etiology. During the period of the second 
rise in incidence of influenza (1st quarter of 1988), 22 strains 
of the virus sero-subtype A(H3N2) were isolated from material 
taken from 414 patients. The strains were characterized by 
marked antigenic heterogeneity. One strain showed great 
resemblance to the standard A/Si-Chwan/2/87, others to 
A/Mississippi/1/85, and others yet to A/Philippines/2/82. HIT of 
181 paired serum samples of patients demonstrated diagnostic 
rise in antibody titer to virus A(H3N2) in 18.2 percent of the 
cases, to A(H1N1) in 2.2 percent, and to B in 3.3 percent. In 
March, testing of 69 pairs of blood serum samples revealed an 
increase to 17.4 percent in seroconversions to influenza B 
virus. During the period of epidemic rise in influenza, 
serologically we established microcirculation of relic strains 
of influenza A(H2N2) virus and A(H0N1) to 4.0 percent, as well 
as active circulation of other groups of respiratory viruses: 
parainfluenza, RS virus, and adenovirus, the share of which 
ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 percent. 
  In 1989, the epidemic rise in incidence of influenza in 
Alma-Ata started among 4-14-year school children in the 4th week 
of the year (16-22 January). Two weeks later, the flu epidemic 
struck preschool children 3-6 years of age and adults. The 
epidemic lasted in the city for 7 weeks, and in this period 12.8 
percent of the children 3-6 years old were stricken, 17.3 
percent of those 7-14 years old and 1.1 percent of adults. On 
the whole, 4.2 percent of the city's inhabitants were stricken 
with the flu during the epidemic. The distinction of this 
epidemic was also predominant involvement of the child 
population; however, the youngest age group (0-2 years old) was 
not involved in the flu epidemic process. 
  During the epidemic period, we examined virologically 364 
samples of nasopharyngeal washings. We isolated 10 
hemagglutinating agents, 6 of which were referable to influenza 
A(H1N1) virus, 1 to A(H3N2), 1 to B, and 2 isolates were a 
mixture of serovariants A(H1N1) and A(HSW1N1). Strains of 
A(H1N1) showed antigenic resemblance to standard viruses 
A/Prague/1/84 and A/Taiwan/1/86, and were neutralized by immune 
sera to these viruses to a full and half homologous titer, 
respectively. HIT of 151 paired serum samples from patients 
revealed diagnostic increase in titers of antigens to A(H1N1) in 
8.0 percent of the cases, to B in 11.2 percent, to A(H3N2) in 
2.0 percent, and mixed influenza infection was found in 4.6 
percent. 
  In January 1990, there was a new epidemic rise in influenza 
in Alma-Ata. Unlike the preceding epidemics, it began among the 
adult population in the 2d week of the year (8-14 January), and 
a week later children became involved in the epidemic. Maximum 
incidence of influenza was recorded only 3 weeks after the start 
of the epidemic, when 2.5 percent of the inhabitants were 
involved. On the whole, the epidemic lasted in the city for 6 
weeks, and 4.7 percent of the inhabitants were stricken. Also, 
in the period of the epidemic, 1.5 percent of children up to 2 
years old, 11.4 percent of those 3-6 years old, 12.9 percent of 
those 7-14 years of age and 2.4 percent of adults were stricken 
with the flu. These findings indicate that in this epidemic too, 
morbidity among preschool and schoolchildren exceeded that of 
adults by 5.5 times (see Table 1). 
  Virological examination of 293 samples of nasopharyngeal 
washings in the 1st quarter of 1990 resulted in isolation of 8 
strains of influenza A(H3N2) virus, 4 of which were isolated 
form children up to 14 years of age and the other 4, from 
adults. The etiology of the epidemic was confirmed by 
serological testing of 182 paired blood serum samples from 
patients with the flu. Thus, influenza A(H3N2) was documented in 
28.6 percent of the tested individuals. 
  Thus, in 1985-1990, there were 6 recorded influenza 
epidemics 
in Alma-Ata, 2 of which were caused by influenza virus serotype 
B (1986, 1987) and the other 4, by influenza A virus. In 
particular, there was prevalence among the public of strains of 
variants of A(H1N1) in 1985, 1986 and 1989, and of influenza 
A(H3N2) virus in 1988 and 1990.

  [Text] The operation of existing and 
the construction of new equipment for producing microbial 
synthesis products is currently giving rise to sharp social 
protest in connection with environmental contamination by 
microorganism cells in the gas emissions of these industries 
that cause acute respiratory diseases in humans. 
  The specifics of producing the majority of microbial 
synthesis products, including the production of feed proteins, 
involve the fact that during their growth process, 
microorganisms utilize oxygen, the source of which is, as a 
rule, air, which is released to the atmosphere after it has 
passed through the reactor. 
  The traditional scheme for producing microbial synthesis 
products includes a bioreactor (fermenter), air processing 
equipment, and equipment for purifiying the gas exiting the 
reactor. 
  Air processing equipment is intended for purifying gas of 
solid and harmful gaseous contaminants, compressing and 
condensing air, separating condensed moisture, and sterilization. 
  Equipment for purifying gas exiting the reactor is intended 
for trapping aerosols. As a rule, wet or dry filters are used 
for this. However, wet filters have a low purification 
effectiveness, and dry fabric filters, while they are relatively 
highly effective, have a high hydraulic resistance and require 
frequent regeneration or filter element changes, which makes it 
impossible to maintain sterility in the production space. 
  Due to the large volume of air that passes through the 
reactor per unit time (5000 - 3 m[.sup]3[/]/hr), which 
results in a low level of oxygen removal from the air (no 
greater than 15%), and the need to mix the liquid medium, 
equipment for processing and purifying air is significantly 
large. 
  In such a manner, the creation of ecologically pure 
technology allows one to overcome problems that have arisen and 
to give new momentum to the development of microbial synthesis. 
  The basic principle of creating ecological pure technologies 
lies in organizing a closed cycle, which is accomplished by 
capturing the carbon dioxide evolved in the reactor by means of 
sorption methods and returning the purfied gas to the reactor 
after adding the required amount of oxygen to it. 
  In this case, total oxygen utilization is achieved, whereas 
in a traditional apparatus, losses of oxygenated air are 
unavoidable, which leads to high air and energy consumption. The 
absorption of carbon dioxide from spent gas can be accomplished 
by chemical or physical sorption. In this case, the need for 
equipment to process air and biologically purify it after exit 
from the reactor drops. 
  A diagram of the equipment that carry out an ecologically 
pure method for producing microbial synthesis products with the 
application of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gas 
after its use in the reactor is presented in fig. 1. 



  Such a method for organizing the purification of spent gas 
leads to additional costs associated with chemisorbent 
consumption and the need to reprocess or neutralize reaction 
products. 
  Organization of the closed cycle with the application of 
physical sorption of carbon dioxide assumes regeneration of the 
absorber (monoethanolamine) and generation of carbon dioxide, 
which is widely used in various industrial sectors. A diagram of 
equipment intended for producing microbial synthesis products 
with physical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gaseous 
mixture is presented in fig. 2. 




    Regardless of the apparent prospects of technology for 
producing microbial synthesis products by organizing a closed 
gas cycle based on chemical or physical sorption of carbon 
dioxide, additional expenditures will be required with its 
implementation that are associated with creating equipment for 
producing pure oxygen and with the need to regenerate the 
sorbent or to utilize products formed as a result of chemical 
sorption of carbon dioxide. 
  Therefore, there is definite interest in a combined method 
where microorganisms that utilize oxygen and give off carbon 
dioxide in their life processes are cultured with microorganisms 
that utilize carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. For example, 
combined culturing of Candida scottii yeast and 
chlorella, whose biomass may be used as a feed additive, has 
been conducted. A diagram of equipment for combined production 
of C. scotii yeast and chlorella is presented in fig. 
3. 




    Such a method allows one to organize ecologically pure and 
absolutely waste-free production of microbial synthesis products 
with a significant reduction in the equipment required for this 
task, as well as in capital and operational expenditures. 
  The achievement of ecologically pure methods of conducting 
microbial synthesis assumes the use of high-efficiency reactors 
capable of processing highly concentrated nutrient media with 
low air (gas) and energy consumption.

  [Text]The primary stages of the information technology 
developed for creating and supporting a data base on metabolic 
pathways are presented in this article. The methods utilized for 
formalizing and visualizing information on metabolic pathways 
are described. A description is given of the developed software, 
which allows one to search for metabolic pathways by key words 
(their names, names of substances, enzymes) and produce a 
graphic image on the screen in various forms. 
  Existing methods of presenting information on cell 
metabolism, in our opinion, do not guarantee effective access to 
the information and do not allow one to apply modern analytical 
methods. 
  The presentation of information on metabolic pathways in the 
form of graphic diagrams is generally accepted. Diagrams of 
metabolic pathways are encountered in the majority of 
biochemistry textbooks, and charts [1, 2] and maps [3, 4] of 
metabolic pathways are widespread. Authors of original 
scientific publications on new metabolic pathways also make use 
of diagrams. 
  Apparently, visualization of information in the form of 
diagrams does not have an alternative because without graphic 
images, it is extremely difficult to represent a system in its 
entirety. Nevertheless, presenting information on cell 
metabolism in the form of metabolic maps does not guarantee 
effective access to the information and does not allow one to 
apply modern computer analysis methods. 
  The goal of this work was to create a computer data base on 
metabolic pathways that, together with the use of traditional 
visualization methods, would allow one to apply various computer 
analysis methods. In this case, it would be necessary to develop 
an effective system that would allow one to store and quickly 
process information on metabolic pathways, as well as make it 
possible for one to interface with other biochemistry and 
molecular biology data bases. 
<H3>  Primary Stages of the Technology for Support and Utilization 
of the Data Base on Metabolic Pathways </H3>
  The GDMP (graphic data base on metabolic pathways) is a 
software system for processing and storing information on 
metabolic pathways, the primary portions of which are the 
language for representing primary data, the data base, support 
software for the data base, and software for accessing and 
analyzing information stored in the data base. 
  Technology for operating the data base can be divided into 
three primary parts: translation of the original information on 
a metabolic pathway into the formal language for representing 
primary data, the MPDL (metabolic pathway data language), input 
of changes into the data base via the MPBM (metabolic pathway 
base manager) system, and user access to information via MPBR 
(metabolic pathway base retriever) software. The overall scheme 
of data base operation is shown in greater detail in fig. 1. 




<H3>    Formalizing the Object Field and the MPDL Language for 
Representing Primary Data </H3>
  Metabolic pathway determination. There is no exact 
determination of metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, the current 
practice of dividing overall cell metabolism into individual 
metabolic pathways indicates that in such a division, nodal 
substances play a key role in cell metabolism. Nodal substances 
participate in many metabolic transformations as starting 
substrates or final products. An example of a nodal substance is 
glucose-6-phosphate, which participates in glycolysis, glycogen 
synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and many other 
transformations. Another example of a nodal substance is 
pyruvate, with which many metabolic transformations begin or 
end. Glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvate are related nodal 
substances coupled by the glycolysis metabolic pathway. 
  In this work, the metabolic pathway is determined as a 
sequence of reactions interacting with each other through common 
intermediates that couple related nodal substances. In a 
confluent case, the metabolic pathway can be represented as a 
single reaction. 
  In order to facilitate graphic imaging of metabolic pathways 
and their analysis, it is advisable to utilize representation on 
the three hierarchically organized levels introduced in [5] for 
poly-enzyme systems. 
  According to [5], the interactions of metabolic pathway 
reactions through common intermediates comprise the primary 
structure of this pathway. The primary structure does not 
include interactions through common coenzymes or regulatory 
substances. A well-known example of using the primary structure 
for graphic representation of metabolism is D. Nicholson's map 
"Metabolic Pathways" [3]. In the primary structure, each 
substance is represented by only one node. Such a structure is 
the skeleton of the metabolic pathway whose graphic image is 
required. 
  The addition of interactions of reactions through common 
coenzymes to the primary structure leads to a secondary or 
stoichiometric metabolic pathway structure. The complete image 
of all possible interactions of a metabolic pathway's secondary 
structure may be unsuitable due to the multiple participation of 
coenzymes in various pathway reactions. Therefore, the secondary 
structure is usually represented in a form in which connections 
through common coenzymes are by broken lines. In such an image, 
each coenzyme may be represented by several nodes if it 
participates in several reactions. 
  In order to simplify images, several connections through 
substances in the primary structure may be by broken lines. 
Usually these are simple inorganic substances of the type 
H[.sup]2[/]O, CO[.sub]2[/], orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, 
etc. A well-known example of using such a broken-line secondary 
structure of metabolic pathways is G. Michal's map "Biochemical 
Pathways" [4], published by Boehringer, Germany. 
  The set of all stoichiometric interactions of the secondary 
structure, supplemented by nonstoichiometric regulator 
interactions, comprises the tertiary structure of the metabolic 
pathway [5]. 
  In this work, only the simplest task--computer display of 
the 
secondary structure of metabolic pathways--is discussed. 
  In order to simplify further presentation, we will agree to 
call substances that participate in primary structure 
interactions and that are represented by unique nodes "metabolic 
pathway intermediates." We will call substances that supplement 
the primary structure up to the secondary structure, as well as 
primary structure substances that are graphically represented by 
broken, non-unique nodes, "cointermediates." 
  MPDL language for representing data. The MPDL 
language for representing data is a subset of the format for 
representing data from the DBEMP factual data base on enzymes 
and metabolic pathways [6]. 
  The MPDL language is intended for formally describing 
metabolic pathways, and it includes software for describing the 
bibliographic source of information, the biological source, the 
intracellular localization of enzymes, and the metabolic pathway 
reactions themselves. 
  The MPDL-file is in ASCII format and consists of records. 
  A record is a logical unit of language that describes an 
individual metabolic pathway and consists of a sequence of 
fields. 
  A field consists of a title, located in the first columns 
and 
containing a portion separated from the title by a space. Fields 
are divided into "required" and "not required." 
  The MPDL language is compatible with the DBEMP format in 
such 
a way that any MPDL-record satisfies DBEMP requirements. A DBEMP 
record satisfies MPDL requirements if it meets the following two 
conditions: 
  1) the two fields required for an MPDL-record are present; 
  2) the MPDL syntax rules are followed. 
  Representation of primary data on a metabolic pathway 
in MPDL language. The described version of the data base 
includes an MPDL variant in which a record may contain 10 
fields. Their designations are briefly described below: 
  AN (accession number) contains a record identifier; 
  SO (source) contains a bibliographic description of the 
information source; 
  OR (organism) and OCN (organism common name) contain the 
systematic and commonly used names of an organism; 
  SPN (systematic pathway name), MPW (metabolic pathway), and 
APN (alternative pathway name) contain the systematic, 
recommended, and commonly used names of a metabolic pathway; 
  MPW E has the form of a table, consisting of a title line 
and 
content lines. The title line contains names of fields in the 
table. Content lines contain descriptions of the metabolic 
pathway reactions contained in these fields; four fields in the 
table--EC (enzyme code), EN (enzyme name), RE (reaction), and RD 
(reaction direction)--are entered in the appropriate language 
variant and contain the enzyme code, the recommended name, the 
reaction, and the reaction direction, respectively; 
  DES (designation) contains abbreviated names of substances; 
  INM (intermediates) contains names of metabolic pathway 
intermediates (but not cointermediates). 
  A sample record in MPDL language is given below. 


<H5>  MPBM Data Base Support Software </H5>
  MPBM software is executed in the form of a 300 K EXE-file. 
It 
is in C language (QuickC compiler, Microsoft). The system is 
intended for MPDL-file (containing MPDL language records) 
processing by the expert-operator with the goals of filling the 
data base, entering changes to the graphic images stored in the 
data base, and retrieval when information from the data base is 
needed. Expert-operator interface with MPBM is accomplished by 
means of a system of menus and dialog windows. 
  MPDL language translator. The two-way translator 
assures syntax and name verification and the formation of 
internal representation of metabolic pathways, including the 
stoichiometric matrix and the incidence matrix for subsequent 
construction of graphic images. 
  In general, the process proceeds with the participation of 
the expert-operator, who responds to system requests in specific 
situations. For example, with the appearance of an unknown 
substance name in the system, direct support of the expert is 
required in order to remove mistakes from the name. 
  Metabolic pathway imaging. General description. 
The image is a two-dimensional graph. The graphics software is 
divided into three types of nodes and two types of branches. 
  Each node type designates a metabolic pathway enzyme, 
intermediate, or co-intermediate (see the section "Metabolic 
pathway determination"). Each enzyme or intermediate is 
designated by a single node. Cointermediates are designated by 
several nodes, each of which corresponds to the 
co-intermediate's participation in a given reaction. 
  A branch of the first type is always directed from an 
intermediate to an enzyme and indicates the intermediate's 
participation as a substrate in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. A 
branch of the second type is always directed from an enzyme to 
an intermediate and indicates the intermediate's participation 
as a product in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. 
  An image may also contain various names for each node and be 
viewed on two different scales. 
  Initial planar configuration of the graph. A special 
interative algorithm for planar graph configuration is utilized 
to construct the inital image [7]. The algorithm is empirical 
and intended for producing graphic images that are visually well 
perceived. Our experience indicates that as a result of using 
the algorithm, at least the general structure of the graph is 
viewed well. 
  In conjunction with a sensitive algorithm developed by us 
for 
the initial configuration of points, the system asks the 
operator to assign one of two methods for initial configuration 
of graph nodes, utilizing his own knowledge regarding the cyclic 
nature of the metabolic pathway. 
  MPGE graphic editor. The MPGE graphic editor is intended for 
putting the metabolic pathway image in a form suitable for 
visual analysis. 
  The editor's resources take into account requirements that 
are traditionally imposed on metabolic pathway diagrams, but 
they do not restrict the author in the selection of a method for 
planar graph configuration. All operations can be carried out 
with a mouse. 
  The editor allows one to intermix individual nodes or groups 
of nodes and to arrange a group of nodes in a circle of desired 
radius or in a line of desired length. Operations may be 
conducted on two image scales. It is possible to work with named 
nodes or without them. With the input of changes, the image is 
automatically reconstructed. 
  Information storage in the data base. Data base 
structure. After an image of the required form is created, 
information on the metabolic pathway can be stored in the data 
base by means of a special command. The image form is stored as 
node coordinates. 
  The data base consists of 16 files in the relational SUBD 
"Paradox" (Borland) format that contain information on metabolic 
pathways in an internal form as well as support information. 
  Input of changes to the data base. It is possible 
to input two types of changes: changes to the image form and 
changes to metabolic pathway information at the 
MPDL-communication level. 
  In the first case, changes are entered by means of the MPGE 
editor; in the second--it is possible to retrieve information on 
a metabolic pathway from the data base by means of a special 
command and then to input the appropriate changes into the 
MPDL-file and rewrite the necessary record (see also fig. 1). 
<H5>  Software for Accessing the MPBR Data Base </H5>
  MPBR software is executed in the form of a 200 K EXE-file. 
It 
is in C language (QuickC compiler, Microsoft). The system is 
intended for assuring user access to information on metabolic 
pathways and also includes software for analyzing metabolic 
pathways. MPBR operates in the EGA graphic regime. User 
interface includes a hierarchical menu system, a series of 
pictograms, and a help window system. Complete 
interchangeability of the keyboard and mouse is assured. The 
metabolic pathway image is also used as a graphic interface. 
  Version 1.3 (October 1992) contains the resources described 
below. 
  Information on data base content. The user can 
obtain information regarding the number of metabolic pathways 
contained in the data base as well as about the overall number 
of substances and enzymes that participate in them. 
  Viewing metabolic pathway diagrams. The user 
selects a desired pathway from an alphabetized list of 
recommended names of metabolic pathways, at which point he gains 
access to systematic and commonly used names of the metabolic 
pathway as well as the biological source given in the original 
report. A portion of the menu system, with which these 
operations are executed, is shown in fig. 2. 




    After selection of a metabolic pathway, the system proceeds 
to the viewing regime. The image may be viewed in two ranges. 
Transition to the larger scale proceeds with the aid of a 
movable scale frame. 
  It is possible to include the names of graph nodes in the 
image. Names are EC-codes or recommended names for enzymes (in 
agreement with the enzyme classification in [8]) and complete or 
abbreviated names for substances. 
  In fig. 3, made from a screen display, a black-and-white 
image of the citric acid cycle is shown. 




    Figure 4 shows how a portion of this image appears on a 
larger scale. 




    Searching for metabolic pathways containing a specific 
substance or enzyme. The user selects a desired object from 
an alphabetized list of substance or enzyme names and obtains a 
list of metabolic pathways in which the given substance or 
enzyme participates. A portion of the corresponding menu system 
is shown in fig. 5. 




    This list is analogous to the general list of recommended 
names (see ``Viewing metabolic pathway diagrams''). While 
viewing images of metabolic pathways from the list, one can 
obtain information about the participation of the enzyme or 
substance in each of them. To accomplish this, the system 
automatically selects, during image formation via the graphics 
software, the substance or enzyme about which the inquiry was 
made. 
<H5>  Discussion of Results and Prospective Development </H5>
  In this work, software for visualizing and processing 
information based on the GDMP data base is described. Primary 
information on the structure of a metabolic pathway and the 
intermediates and enzymes participating in it is contained in 
the data base; however, several important characteristics have 
not yet been reflected by the data base software. In the 
described version of the data base, information on the 
intracellular localization of enzymes of a metabolic path and 
their regulation is absent. It is planned to include this 
information in future versions. 
  In the next versions, a link should also be established with 
the factual data base on enzymes and metabolic pathways in DBEMP 
[6] so that the user would be able to obtain information on the 
catalytic, regulatory, and molecular biological properties of 
enzymes participating in metabolic pathways. 
  There is definite interest, in our opinion, for the user to 
have the resources to view structural formulas of intermediates 
via the estblishment of a link with the corresponding data base. 
  Development of software, on the basis of this data base, for 
automating mathematical modeling and using algorithms for 
analyzing graphs for studying various aspects of metabolic 
pathway functioning appears interesting and promising to us. 
  We will be grateful for any comments or suggestions 
concerning possibilities for developing the system in these and 
other directions.

  [Abstract] Sulfoaromatic compounds, which are among the 
most important products of the chemical industry, are also 
environmental pollutants. Because strains that destroy such 
compounds have been only partially described, the researchers 
here sought to present a complete picture of the genetic control 
and regulation of the process associated with the decomposition 
of sulfoaromatic compounds. In studying the genetic control of 
the decomposition of arylsulfonates in Pseudomonas 
sp. BS1304, they demonstrated that the process of destruction is 
controlled by the plasmid pBS1004, which has a molecular weight 
of 120 kbp and belongs to the IncP-9 incompatibility group. The 
plasmid can be isolated in P. putida, P. aeruginosa, 
and P. mendocina. Degradation of the substrates 
begins with desulfonation and subsequent meta-cleavage of the 
substituted catechols. Both stages are effected by enzymes with 
high substrate specificity. The researchers found that the 
instability of the trait under consideration was associated with 
the formation of spontaneous deletions in the plasmid. 
Ultimately, the researchers demonstrated that the formation of 
such deletions is induced by Rms178 of the IncP-2 
incompatibility group. Figures 3, references 13: 1 Russian, 12

  [Text] The fate of the future of every people depends on 
their natural and social characteristics and the totality of 
external effects. The natural foundation of a population is 
represented by the gene pool, which is the basis of population 
integrity and stability, as well as of its functioning and 
development. The condition of the gene pool is determined both 
by internal laws and external effects of ecological factors. It 
is well known that a joint action of genetic mechanisms and 
ecological factors causes around 60% of the total amount 
of 
damage of population condition and health. However, in Ukraine a 
certain asymmetry in attention given to these two components has 
formed: while wide circles of scientists and public have 
expressed steadfast and strong interest in the ecology 
component, the genetic component is drawing attention of very 
few research professionals. So the real contribution of genetic 
mechanisms to health condition of the population has not yet 
become the subject of modern wide)scale theoretical and applied 
studies. However, it is clear that the nearest future of 
Ukraine's population depends to a large extent on timely and 
complex solution of the gene pool problem.To make this statement 
not just clear intuitively but also well reasoned we shall turn 
now to well)known facts.1. Since 1989 the reproduction of 
Ukraine's population has been decreasing, and there is a danger 
of its depopulation. Mortality has surpassed the birth rate 
[1,2]. According to Minstat [the Ministry of Statistics of 
Ukraine] the index of natural reduction of Ukraine's population 
was 39147 people in 1991 and 96861 in 1992. At the same time the 
reproduction rate for the number of girls born per woman who 
have reached 15 years of age and has dropped below one, to 0.976 
[1, 2]. In the last decade the frequency of hypotrophy among the 
newborn has increased fivefold, and the frequency of genetic 
disturbances, native developmental defects, spontaneous 
miscarriages and psychic diseases has also increased. 46% 
of 
high school students suffer from various chronic diseases, and 
one out of two has morphological and functional disturbances. 
Only 5 to 8% of high school graduates can be considered 
healthy 
[1, 3].Thus, dangerous trends of increasing reproductive losses 
of and genetic load in Ukraine's population have clearly 
shaped.2. The damaging effect of the extremely tense ecological 
situation in Ukraine is getting more serious. Excessive 
concentration of the metal mining, metallurgical, coal mining, 
power generating and chemical industries with their mostly 
obsolete and ecologically dangerous equipment, and inefficient 
and sometimes monoculture agriculture, they all dangerously 
pollute the environment. In the majority of regions atmospheric 
air pollution exceeds maximum permissible levels five to 
twentyfold, ground is being chemically poisoned, and 3 billion 
cubic meters of polluted sewage are dischargedT)annually into 
the environment [4]. The chemical load on the gene pool is 
increased due to the effect of the Chernobyl catastrophe. In 
recent years the number of certain oncological, hematological 
and endocrine diseases has increased, while the overall level of 
immune protection in people has decreased, especially in those 
who had been subjected to the effect of Chernobyl radiation 
factors.3. A number of infections, especially such as 
chlamidioses, mycoplasmoses, ureoplasmoses, as well as 
gelmintoses and virus carrying, have a negative effect on the 
gene pool.4. Ukraine has a relatively high level of a number of 
hereditary diseases and native developmental defects, and due to 
the extremely low availability of diagnostic means and 
medication they have an especially high negative effect on the 
gene pool.5. The multinational and multiethnic character of 
Ukraine's population is the result of the complicated history of 
the people who for many centuries has been divided among several 
states and affected by internal and external migration of large 
population masses, the 1932/ 1933 famine, substantial losses 
during WWII and other factors. This is why the gene pool of 
Ukraine's population and her regional and ethnic formations 
requires that a differentiated population)genetic research be 
conducted.The above circumstances (as well as other 
circumstances that have not been listed, make it possible to 
conclude that the question is not only preservation but also 
protection of Ukraine's gene pool. Apparently it is necessary to 
have a thoroughly thought over and carefully worked out program 
of scientific studies and practical actions.The main idea in 
developing a program to protect the gene pool of Ukraine's 
population is the understanding of its urgency by a group of 
scientists and by the Health Ministry management and taking into 
account certain work performed in this area and the available 
personnel and material and technical potential.A group of 
scientists had been developing the program in the 1980s, but it 
only became possible to develop a complete project in 1990/1991. 
The concept of the Program is based on the fact that problems of 
legislative, medical, scientific, personnel, economic and 
organizational support must be solved in an integrated manner, 
with a clear definition of the work scope and stages.The Program 
has been developed for a five)year period and counts on 
participation of researchers from various fields of biological 
and medical science and medical)genetic service 
practitioners.All Program provisions were centered around the 
following conceptual components: 1) studying the status of the 
gene pool of Ukraine's population; 2) genetic monitoring; 3) 
prevention and treatment of hereditary disturbances and native 
developmental defects; and 4) computerized forecasting systems 
for integrated control of the gene pool of Ukraine's population 
[5].The Program passed the competition conducted in 1991)1992 by 
the State Committee of Ukraine on Science and Technology 
Problems and took the first prize in the ``Human Health'' field. 
Thus it has acquired the status of a state S&amp;T Program.In 
1992 
74 projects of 27 academic and industry scientific and 
scientific production organizations and universities were under 
way within the Program framework. The Program consists of 8 
sections and 48 subsections that cover aspects of medical and 
scientific support and infrastructure ) creation of a scientific 
research institute and specialized medical genetics centers, as 
well as personnel, material, organizational and economic 
support.A number of studies regarding the status of the gene 
pool and effects of)ecological factors were performed.The 
mutagenous load on the environment was analyzed and evaluated. 
In particular, the summary mutagenous activity of the aerosol 
portion of chemical pollutants of atmospheric air was studied 
using the Ames method. It was demonstrated that in a group of 
``metallurgical'' towns the activity exceeded background values 
by a factor of 13 to 20, (``average'' mutageneity), while in 
towns with prevailing development of the chemical industry it 
varied between ``weak'' and ``average''. However, it was found 
that even in a control group of relatively ``clean'' towns 
genetic toxicity of air exceeded the background (by 50% in 
Sevastopol and by a factor of 8 in Poltava) (see the article by 
O.M. Dugan et al. in this issue of the magazine).Scientific 
foundations of screening for native and hereditary pathology had 
been developed, and the screening was conducted.An account of 
hereditary and native pathology and perinatal mortality among 
Kiev newborn was conducted, and the structure of native 
developmental defects was studied. It was demonstrated that in 
recent years the level of their variations varied within a wide 
range, albeit without any growth trends. This calls for studying 
the spread of dominant and recessive pathology in capital's 
population and for creation of a computerized register [7].A 
retrospective analysis of the structure of hereditary pathology 
in the Western region of Ukraine was conducted. It showed 
different densities of native developmental defects, 
phenylketonuria and hypothyrosis in various oblasts. The scope 
of necessary studies in each oblast and measures aimed at 
improving organization of medical preventive work were 
determined (Lviv Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Hereditary Pathology 
SRI, MOZ Ukrayiny).The frequency and types of chromosome 
aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of people that had 
been subjected to radiation effects after the ChAES [Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant] accident were studied. Significant 
individual variability of their frequency had been noticed. It 
was concluded that according to cytologic analysis data it can 
be considered a confirmed fact that radiation affected not only 
on those who participated in liquidation of consequences of the 
ChAES accident and residents of the stringent radiation control 
zone, but also Kievites. Taking into account the fact that 
genome changes can facilitate an increased share of certain 
malignant tumors, the studies that were conducted orient one 
towards individual approach to studies of the contribution of 
both damaging environmental factors and the hereditary component 
to the development of pathology (Experimental Pathology, 
Oncology and Radio Biology Institute, AN Ukrayiny).Studies of 
the spread of hereditary propensity to disturbances of formation 
and native developmental defects of the locomotor system in 
Ukraine regions with different levels of inbreeding and 
environmental pollution demonstrated that the most frequent 
disturbances were the ankle joint pathology and foot 
deformation. The frequency of this pathology in regions that had 
suffered from the ChAES accident especially hard and in 
ecologically disadvantageous Donets basin rayons is considerably 
higher than in Kiev. The studies continue, and a computerized 
register and forecasting model are being developed (see the 
article by A.P. Krasyuk et al. in this issue of the magazine).It 
was found that the number of cases of native pathology of organs 
of vision in children is increasing (approximately one third of 
all patients). Pathologies such as ptosis, dermoid cysts, 
hemangiomas and retinoblastomas are unevenly distributed among 
Ukraine regions. Among those hospitalized with a hereditary 
pathology of cornea the most frequently encountered was a 
chronic form of keratoconus and the least frequently encountered 
was peripheral keratoconus (Terien disease), but no regional 
differences had been detected. In children that had recieved a 
large overall dose of radiation due to the Chernobyl 
catastrophe, the frequency of the ophthalmologic pathology 
hasT)increased (Ukrainian Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue 
Therapy, MOZ Ukrayiny).According to preliminary analysis data in 
cases of hearing diseases the most frequently observed is the 
autosomal recessive type of inheritance of deafness and reduced 
hearing, while the autosomal dominant type and the type linked 
to the X chromosome are less frequent. The expediency of 
regional and population studies of inherited pathology of organs 
of hearing, determining the probability of its detection and 
treating it as a separate group was demonstrated (Kiev 
Otolaryngology SRI, MOZ Ukrayiny).Of great scientific importance 
are projects devoted to human genome, which form a section of 
the Program. The work is being conducted at a state of the art 
molecular)biological level and has yielded interesting results. 
Libraries of the 3rd, 5th and 19th chromosomes have been 
amplified. mRNA were extracted from human and rabbit livers in 
order to create kDNA probes. Major transcripts that yield 
themselves to alternative processing were extracted from the 
kDNA library of human embryo livers. mRNA from human brain and 
kidney and the entire RNA from a human heart were extracted in 
order to create kDNA probes. Differential screening of the kDNA 
library of human livers was performed, and clones with liver 
specific and "generic" genes were obtained.The spectrum of 
2.5)oligoadenylates in initial cultures of cells of chronic 
lymphoid leukosis patients was studied, as well as changes of 
the expression of receptors of interleukin 2 and the C3 fraction 
of the complement in patients' leukocytes due to the effect of 
immunity correcting preparations.The possibility of injecting 
RecA protein E. coli into an jejukaryotic cell while 
preserving protein enzyme activity has been demonstrated. 
Peculiarities of expression of the human ApoAI genome and DNA 
genes in a cell culture of mammals controlled by promoters of 
cytomegalovirus, mice rybosomic and RNA polymerase II were 
studied (human Alu repeat). It was demonstrated that in a 
plasmid retrovector DNA (plasmid probe pSTH lg 1/Rtsp) there is 
a fragment that corresponds to the human growth hormone gene. 
This makes it possible to continue developing a gene therapy 
model based on the human hematopoietic system. A system for 
computer storage and processing of electrophoregrams, 
particularly when detecting point mutations in various genome 
areas, was developed. Based on computer analysis data, 
oligonucleotide primers for the constant area of the IgE gene 
were calculated. It was demonstrated that the IgE response 
(pollinosis) is linked to human organism resistivity to 
respiratory diseases, and it was also found that in recent years 
there had been a trend towards a decrease in the number and 
functional activity of T lymphocytes accompanied by increased 
reactivity of B lymphocytes (Molecular Biology and Genetics 
Institute, AN Ukrayiny; Ukrainian Medical Genetics Science 
Center, MOZ and AN Ukrayiny).Work on genetic monitoring is 
conducted within the framework of the Program. The key point of 
the work is a combination of genetic and ecological studies. 
Results of studies of ground in five national preserves in the 
Western, Eastern and Southern regions show the presence of toxic 
and mutagenous effects. Analysis of aberrations (mostly 
chromatide) detected in sprout roots of Allium cepa 
onion shows the dominant action of chemical mutagens, and in 
areas adjacent to arable land it could possibly be pesticide 
phenomena. But positive results of bioindication in the absence 
of evidence of the presence of local pollution sources indicate 
a regional or global (including biospheric) character of 
pollution [8].Work has begun on genotoxicological evaluation of 
the territory of national preserve ``Roztochchya'' (Lviv 
oblast). The system of tests includes the AmesT)test, test for 
dominant lethal mutations and test for somatic mutations and 
recombination. In the water reservoirs at the reserve a 
mutagenic effect in fish was found. An assumption of industrial 
pollution was made. The studies that have been performed are 
part of the work on inventorying mutagens in the Lviv oblast 
(Lviv University).The level of genotoxic pollution of areas of 
the lower Danube and Dnieper (using bacterial test systems with 
salmonella strains) is being studied. Accumulation of genotoxic 
pollution in the silt of region's lakes and rivers was detected. 
Considerable variations of mutagenic activity at levels 
exceeding the spontaneous level by a factor of 2 to 6 was 
noticed. Activity of mutagenic action of organic)soluble 
fractions was considerably higher than that of water soluble 
fractions (Odessa University). Based on studies that used 
measurements of activity of marked enzymes of 
pseudocholinesterase and creatine phosphokinase, determining the 
amount of peroxide oxidation of lipoids and accumulation of 
malone dialdehyde in blood samples (taken to a low temperature 
bank from blood transfusion stations in several unfavorable 
areas of the Donets)Dnieper region and city of Kharkiv) it was 
found that the maximum permissible level of heavy metals had 
been exceeded. Computerized processing of the results is 
promising for development of genetic monitoring (Problems of 
Cryobiology and Cryomedicine Institute, AN Ukrayiny). Selective 
analysis of chromosome pathology and the condition of chromosome 
apparatus in children in various regions of Ukraine 
(particularly in regions that had suffered from the Chernobyl 
catastrophe) revealed that even in a relatively ``clean'' 
region, the Lviv oblast, the overall frequency of chromosome 
aberrations in newborn in 1992 was approximately 120% 
higher 
than in Kiev in 1984 (Lviv Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Hereditary 
Pathology SRI, MOZ Ukrayiny). Cytogenetic analysis of several 
groups of children residing in areas polluted with radio 
nuclides as a result of the Chernobyl accident demonstrated a 
reliable increase of the frequency of aberrant cells, 
chromosome)type aberrations and specific markers of radiation 
effects. A trend of increasing cytogenetic effect with time is 
being observed [9]. A number of trends of genetic instability 
has been detected in populations adjacent to the ChAES: 
increased number of native anomalies and spontaneous 
miscarriages, a shift of the chromosome aberrations spectrum, 
increased frequency of structural defects in the bone system in 
embryos compared to the control group, and increased share of 
children with disturbances of catabolic P protein homeostasis 
[10].Studies of ecological effects on hereditary pathology had 
led to a search for comparison methods and equivalents of 
effects of various factors. Thus, genetic)epidemiological 
studies of spontaneous miscarriages and native developmental 
defects in ecologically polluted industrial towns demonstrated 
that genetic consequences of the effect of chemical factors can 
be compared to the effect of radiation. For Mariupol they are 
equivalent to the effect of 230 Ber over 30 years [11].Studies 
of problems of diagnostics, prevention and treatment of 
hereditary diseases and native developmental defects are a 
considerable part of the State Program. Cytogenetic examination 
and computerized population analysis of the Kharkiv population 
led to a conclusion of expediency and effectiveness of applying 
genetic approaches to family planning and using the program of 
preconception help to families with native developmental defects 
and aborted pregnancies. A system of preventive measures 
includes family examination, preventive sanation, 
synchronization of reproductive processes and individual 
preventive help to pregnant women. This makes it possible to 
reduce the use of invasiveT) procedures by 33% 
[12].Studies 
have demonstrated that not only complex prenatal diagnostics 
makes it possible to conduct selective examination of women in a 
high)risk group (those suffering from sugar diabetes and 
internal infections, but also perform mass scale screening of 
pregnant women. The complex includes ultrasound scanning and 
timely invasive procedures. Based on examination results not 
only one makes decisions on interrupting pregnancy in expedient 
cases, but also on emergency help to newborn with correctable 
defects [13].A number of projects are aimed at developing 
diagnostic methods and searching for markers that indicate 
genetic disturbances.A test system for early diagnostics of 
dilatation cardiomyopathy using monospecific polyclonal 
antibodies is being developed. It has been demonstrated that in 
all cases of this pathology the serum contains autoantibodies 
against myosin and tropomyosin (Molecular Biology and genetics 
Institute, AN Ukrayiny; Ukrainian Medical Genetics Science 
Center, MOZ and AN Ukrayiny).A 50)item collection of mutants 
that are resistant to glyphosphate, a phosphorus analog of 
glycine. This opens up a possibility for continuing a search for 
methods for affecting a number of molecular)biological 
mechanisms. Certain areas of the Y chromosome were detected and 
analyzed, which forms a basis for testing mutations using 
restriction analysis (Molecular Biology and Genetics Institute, 
AN Ukrayiny). Methods are being developed for using DNA 
analysis of certain mutations and deletions linked to a high 
risk of mucoviscidosis disease and formation of Duchen's 
muscular dystrophy in various regions of Ukraine [14].A 
longitudinal polymorphism of restriction fragments of the apo)B 
gene that were obtained using the polymerase chain reaction and 
then the XbaI and SSt)1 restrictases was studied. The relation 
between the detection of three genotypes of X1X1 and X2X2 and 
indices of lipoid metabolism was analyzed. Prospects for further 
studies of genes of basic apo)proteins in the population at the 
preclinical and clinical stages of atherosclerosis in families 
of young patients have been delineated (Ukrainian Therapy SRI, 
MOZ Ukrayiny). During cytogenetic examination of children that 
were subjected to the effects of the Chernobyl catastrophe an 
increased frequency of specific markers of radiation effects was 
detected, and based on this an attempt was made to calculate the 
overall radiation dose [9].Methods are being developed for 
determining mutagenous effects of chemical and physical factors 
on the gene pool using sensitive genetically marked strains of 
microorganisms that can register one mutation per 10 to 100 
million of normal cells, which borders on the spontaneous 
mutagenesis background (Microbiology and Virology Institute, AN 
Ukrayiny).Enriching the arsenal of anti-mutagenic means is 
especially important for solving problems of preventing and 
correcting hereditary pathology, and it has been the subject of 
several projects.Scientific fundamentals of the search for and 
development and application of antimutagenes and gene protectors 
are being developed. They are aimed at increasing the 
effectiveness of organism's internal protective forces, 
particularly DNA reparation systems, blocking damaged genome 
structures etc.Promising studies of interferon inductors and 
prolongators were performed, and optimum conditions for 
obtaining its preparations and developing a compound that can 
induce interferon that has the antimutagenic effect were 
determined (Kiev University).T 0*0*0*00T The effect of 
bioflavonoids and polysaccharides on anti-mutagenic and radio 
protection activity of beta carotene was studied. It had been 
determined that beta carotene displays well pronounced 
antimutagenic activity against nitrozoguanidine, a supermutagen 
and supercarcinogen, and average antimutagenic activity against 
carbon and phosphorus radioactive isotopes (Microbiology and 
Virology Institute, AN Ukrayiny). A search for natural 
anti-mutagenes is being conducted. Researchers are finding even 
more advantages of natural antimutagenes over chemical factors. 
Experiments with higher plants demonstrate the protective effect 
of the millimeter wave band electric field on the chromosome 
apparatus. It has been determined that low exposures and doses 
of a UHF field help reduce the total number and shrink the 
spectrum of chromosome mutations. The possibility of 
extrapolating these results to other biological objects 
including a human organism has been demonstrated. The search for 
vegetative antimutagenes (a biological mass of rose radiola, 
fern)leaf polyscias etc.) continues, their cytogenic action is 
being studied, and first promising results have been obtained 
(Ukrainian Medical Genetics Science Center, MOZ and AN 
Ukrayiny).The first year of scientific studies according to the 
State S&amp;T Program ``Protection of the Gene Pool of Ukraine's 
Population'' has had productive results.The work of science 
collectives has begun, and authors of research objects and 
methods have been determined. A number of specific results have 
been obtained in all areas of the Program. They are valuable in 
their own right, but what is more important, they open up 
prospects for deepening and widening further science search. 
Research coordination has been set up, and the Ukrainian 
Medical Genetics Science Center, the lead scientific research 
organization in implementing the Program, has been organized.

  [Text] Much attention is currently being devoted to 
indicators of the immune status of healthy people in different 
regions of the country [1]. Persuasive evidence was obtained 
indicating that the body's immune system reacts very sensitively 
to various unfavorable effects, and it can be used to test for 
these effects [3]. Indicators of the immune status of people of 
different regions differ [1]. Such research has special 
significance in the country's ecologically unfavorable regions 
as a way of revealing the extent of the immune system's 
disturbance and the need for purposeful clinical examination and 
treatment and for measures by which to improve the health of the 
people. 
  One of the ecologically unfavorable zones requiring special 
attention is the Aral zone, including the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan, where examination and treatment results for 1989 
[2] reveal elevated morbidity characterized as the 
immunodeficiency syndrome and as the autoimmune and allergic 
syndromes (Table 1). Study of the immune status of the 
population of the Republic of Karakalpakstan is required if we 
are to plan measures to reduce overall morbidity.

<H5>  Research Procedures </H5>
  Three hundred forty-eight practically healthy people from 16 
to 60 years old residing in the three cities of Nukus, Muynak 
and Mangit were examined. Diagnostic questionnaire cards 
developed by the Immunology Institute of the Russian Ministry of 
Health [5] were filled out on each subject. Immune status was 
evaluated in accordance with procedural recommendations of the 
USSR Ministry of Health [5], including level I and II tests. 
Determinations were also made of the concentration of the 
rheumatoid factor, and of antibodies to thyroglobulin and 
trinitrophenyl in blood serum by triphasic immunoenzymatic 
analysis (IEA). The absolute and relative leukocyte and 
lymphocyte counts were estimated by the commonly employed 
procedure using Zadorozhnyy's stain, while T-lymphocytes and 
their subpopulations were determined with monoclonal antibodies 
obtained from the Immunology Institute using a flow-through 
cytometer. The concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM was 
determined by Mancini's method, while IgE was determined by the 
IEA method. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils was evaluated on 
the basis of absorption by latex particles. The t-test was used 
for statistical treatment. 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  According to WHO data diseases associated with disturbance 
of 
immune system function fall within so-called immunopathological 
syndromes (infection, allergic, autoimmune). They manifest 
themselves as chronic inflammatory diseases, as the absence of 
resistance to infections, and as allergic and autoimmune 
afflictions. Questionnaire results revealed that 37.3 percent of 
the surveyed population suffers diseases falling within these 
syndromes. 
  Table 2 gives the average immune status indicators for the 
Karakalpakstan population, as well as for residents of 
Semipalatinsk and workers of an antibiotics plant (Moscow) and 
the Khimplast Plant (Nizhniy Tagil), used for comparison 
purposes (the data were obtained by associates of the Immunology 
Institute of the Russian Ministry of Health). 



  The first interesting thing analysis of the results shows is 
an extremely low concentration of T-lymphocytes and their 
subpopulations in Karakalpakstan residents in terms of both 
percent and absolute content (see Table 2). While the 
concentration of lymphocytes is 63.2 +/- 1.29, 70 +/- 0.7 and 
62.02 +/- 0.45 percent in subjects from Semipalatinsk, Moscow 
and Nizhniy Tagil respectively, for Karakalpakia this indicator 
is 52.58 +/- 0.52 percent. The absolute number of lymphocytes in 
subjects in Karakalpakia is also significantly reduced. The 
concentration of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes among 
Karakalpakstan residents is 39.8 +/- 0.46 percent, while in the 
indicated cities (Semipalatinsk, Moscow, Nizhniy Tagil) it is 
34.4 +/- 1.1, 45 +/- 0.7 and 35.81 +/-0.39 percent respectively. 
In this case the absolute number of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes 
in Karakalpakstan residents averages only 498 
cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. All of the indicated differences are 
statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). 
  An evaluation of the frequency of deviations of the percent 
and absolute concentrations of lymphocytes from average standard 
values in Karakalpakstan residents (Table 3) revealed that the 
lymphocyte count was less than 19 percent for 10.9 percent of 
the subjects, the indicator was above 37 percent for only 6.03 
percent of the subjects, and the absolute lymphocyte count of 33 
percent was less than 1,200 cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. There were an 
especially large number of people with an absolute concentration 
of CD1[.sup]+[/]- and CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes below 
standard indicators (53.2 and 64.6 percent respectively).

  Phagocytic activity of leukocytes was significantly higher 
among Karakalpakstan residents when compared with residents of 
Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil: 85.4 +/- 0.56, 64.8 
+/-0.86, 71 +/- 0.7 and 58.5 +/- 0.99 respectively. The 
percentage of persons for whom the phagocytosis indicator was 
above standard values is 65.8 for Karakalpakstan residents (see 
tables 2, 3). Such an increase in phagocytic activity is 
possibly associated with a source of constant infection. 
  Evaluation of the B-system of immunity in Karakalpakstan 
residents revealed a significantly higher concentration of IgG, 
IgA, IgM and IgE than in the residents of the cities used for 
comparison. Thus, while the concentration of IgG, IgA and IgM in 
residents of Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil was 1337.4 
+/- 21.8, 1313 +/- 27 and 1095.3 +/- 13.17 for IgG, 190.3 +/- 
6.82, 215 +/- 9.1 and 220 +/- 5.7 for IgA, and 156.7 +/- 5.3, 
140 +/- 5.1 and 144.4 +/- 4 for IgM, these indicators for 
Karakalpakstan residents were equal to 1497.6 +/- 17, 265.3 +/- 
5.6 and 167.1 +/- 3.9 respectively. The percentage of people for 
whom these indicators were above normal was 1.14 for IgG, 17.8 
for IgA and 12.9 for IgM (see Table 3). The percentage of 
persons with hypoglobulinemia did not differ from the union-wide 
value. 
  Additional research characterizing activity of the immune 
system did not reveal gross disturbances, and the levels of the 
rheumatoid factor, antibodies to thyroglobulin and 
trinitrophenyl fluctuated within normal limits. 
  The morbidity structure of the Karakalpakstan population is 
dominated by autoimmune diseases, which exceed union-wide 
indicators by 2-8 times, while the frequency of diseases falling 
within the infection syndrome exceeds the union-wide indicator 
by 2.5-4 times (see Table 1). 
  When taken together, these figures are very similar to 
laboratory data and morbidity indicators obtained in surveys of 
elderly people [4]. It may be hypothesized that the residents of 
the indicated regions are exposed to unfavorable factors that 
lead to the described changes in immunological indicators, which 
manifests itself phenomenologically as early aging and as 
diseases associated with immunodeficiency. However, additional 
research will be required to establish a direct relationship 
between this morbidity and disturbance of the immune system. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  1. The relative and absolution numbers of T-lymphocytes and 
their subpopulations are reduced among residents of the 
Karakalpakstan Republic. 
  2. A higher concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE and 
higher phagocytic activity of leukocytes are typical of 
residents of the surveyed region.

  [Text] The data of epidemiological investigations devoted 
to the study of the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) suggest that 
the prevalence of the latter is associated with the level of 
risk factors (RF) in various population groups [4, 14, 17, 26, 
27]. This has been confirmed by the relationship discovered 
between the frequency of identification of CVD and of RF in 
population investigations [7, 11, 14, 18]. As has been 
demonstrated in large prospective investigations, morbidity from 
CVD and mortality from them are determined to a significant 
extent by the level of RF in populations [17, 25]. 
  The epidemiological situation with respect to CVD depends to 
a significant extent also on the frequency of identification of 
various combinations of RF in populations [1, 21, 24, 31]. In 
addition, according to the data of certain investigations, the 
level of RF in populations also depends on such characteristics 
as the age of the population, ethnic affiliation, educational 
level, and the character of the subject's work activity [2, 5, 
13, 23, 30]. And finally, the study of the prevalence of RF 
separately and especially in various combinations is very 
important from the point of view of the assessment of the 
prognostic significance of the level of RF for the development 
of new cases and of mortality from CVD among the population [6, 
10, 18, 31]. 
  The aim of the present investigations was to study the 
comparative characteristic of the prevalence of the principal 
CVD RF individually and in various combinations as a function of 
the character of work activity and educational level among the 
male population aged 20-54 years, living in cities of various 
regions of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]. The 
investigation was carried out within the framework of the 
unified cooperative program, RThe Epidemiology of IHD and 
Atherosclerosis in Various Regions of the CIS and the Baltic 
CountriesS, carried out and coordinated by the Department of the 
Epidemiology of Noninfectious Diseases of the All-Russian 
Scientific Research Center of Preventive Medicine of the 
Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation [VNITsPM Minzdrava 
RF]. 
  Materials and Methods&gt; 
  Random representative samples of the male population aged 
20-54 years, living in one of the regions of eight cities, 
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, 
Tashkent, and Bishkek, were the material for the investigation. 
The number of subject in these cities ranged from 2350 to 2950 
persons with a response rate more than 70%. The program of 
study and its methods were presented in detail in previously 
published papers [8, 9]. Uniform criteria of the level of RF 
were used for all centers in the analysis of the data. A level 
of arterial pressure (AP) of 160/95 mm Hg and above (WHO 
criteria) corresponded to arterial hypertension (AH). The 
assessment of the presence dyslipoproteinemias (DLP) was based 
on the following criteria: a total blood cholesterol level of 
250 mg/dl and above corresponded to hypercholesterolemia (HCH); 
a blood level of total triglycerides of 200 mg/dl and above 
corresponded to hypertriglyceridemia (HTG); and a level of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL CH) of 35 mg/dl and 
below corresponded to hypoalphacholesterolemia (hypo-_a_-HDL 
CH) 
[22]. A body weight index [body weight (BWI) (in 
kg)/height[.sup]2[/] (in m)] of 29.5 kg/m[.sup]2[/] and 
above corresponded to excessive body weight (EBW) [12]. Any man 
smoking at least one cigarette per day was considered a smoker. 
All methods were carefully standardized before the beginning of 
the investigation, and quality control was constantly carried 
out during the investigation. Quality control of the lipid 
studies carried out in all centers was performed by the 
Department of Standardization of Biochemical Research Methods of 
the All-Russian Scientific Research Center of Preventive 
Medicine of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. 
  Results 
  Data on the prevalence of RF (separately and in various 
combinations) in men aged 20-54 years are presented in Table 1. 
The per cent of individuals with one RF was minimal in 
populations of Bishkek and Kiev (26.1 and 28.6, respectively), 
and maximal in men from Moscow and St. Petersburg (42.8 and 
45.1, respectively). Smoking was the most frequently identified 
RF in the populations in question; its frequency ranged from 
13.0 (Bishkek) to 34.5% (St. Petersburg). DLP occupied 
second 
place in prevalence among the RF. This indicator was lowest in 
men from Novosibirsk and highest in the male population of 
Bishkek (3.1% versus 9.9%, respectively). The 
prevalence of 
DLP ranged from 4.1 to 6.3% in other populations. AH came 
next 
in the prevalence of RF, ranging from 1.9% in Tashkent to 
5.2% 
in Novosibirsk. The frequency of identification of EBW among the 
populations studied in Bishkek and Moscow was 0.6 and 
4.1%, 
respectively.

Note. Here and in Tables 2 and 3, the age-standardized indicator is cited. Standard - the male population of the CIS aged from 20 to 54 years. 


  The prevalence of a combination consisting of two RF was 
minimal in the men in Alma-Ata, maximal in Kiev (18.5 and 
30.5%, respectively). The combination of DLP and smoking 
was 
the most frequent combination of two RF in the populations 
examined, in particular, 8.9 and 14.0%, respectively, in 
Moscow 
and Tashkent. The combination of DLP and AH came next: its 
frequency was minimal among the men of Alma-Ata (0.9%), 
and 
maximal among the men of Bishkek (5.3%). The frequency of 
identification of the combinations of AH and EBW and EBW and 
smoking was somewhat lower. 
  The prevalence of a combination consisting of three RF was 
minimal among the men of Alma-Ata (2.7%), and maximal 
among the 
men of Tallinn (7.8%). DLP, smoking, and AH were included 
most 
frequently in a combination of three RF; such a combination was 
found in 0.8% of subjects from Alma-Ata and 3.3% 
of subjects 
from Tallinn. The combination of DLP, EBW, and AH was 
encountered somewhat less frequently: in 0.4% of men from 
Alma-Ata and 3.1% of subjects from Tallinn. The 
combination of 
RF consisting of AH, EBW, and smoking was minimal and maximal in 
Bishkek and Kiev (0.4 and 1.6%, respectively). There were 
overall RF in more than 70% of men studied from 
Novosibirsk and 
Tallinn. RF were observed in the male populations of Moscow and 
St. Petersburg in 68.3 and 69.6%, respectively. A lower RF 
prevalence was observed in men of the Central Asian region (in 
Bishkek, Tashkent, and Alma-Ata, respectively, 64.6, 69.9, and 
61.2%). 
  Data on the prevalence of RF separately and in various 
combinations in the men as a function of the character of their 
work activity are presented in Table 2. The presence of a single 
RF was identified more often in men engaged in physical labor; 
substantial differences in this connection were observed in 
workers doing physical and mental labor in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, and Alma-Ata. At the same time, the 
frequency of identification of smoking among the populations was 
substantially higher in physical laborers. The prevalence of AH 
alone was higher in intellectual workers in the populations from 
Tallinn, Kiev, and Novosibirsk. The frequency of identification 
of EBW did not depend on the character of work activity with the 
exception of men from Tashkent, where EBW was found twice as 
often among intellectual workers.

  A combination of two RF was found significantly more often 
in 
physical laborers only in the populations from Moscow, Tallinn, 
and Bishkek. In the remaining cities the combination of two RF 
did not depend on the character of the work activity of the men. 
The most frequent combination in both intellectual workers and 
physical laborers was the combination of DLP and smoking. This 
combination of RF was observed substantially more often in 
physical laborers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, and Tashkent. The combination of RF comprised of 
DLP and EBW was also identified substantially more often in men 
engaged in physical labor from St. Petersburg and Tallinn. At 
the same time, the combination of DLP and AH was found 
substantially more often in intellectual workers among the 
subjects from St. Petersburg. Other combinations of two RF in 
the populations did not depend on the character of the menUs 
work activity. 
  The prevalence of RF combinations consisting of three RF was 
higher in the majority of populations in physical laborers, but 
a significant difference was observed only in the subjects from 
St. Petersburg and Kiev. DLP, AH, and smoking were included in 
the combination of three RF most often. 
  Overall, in all of populations studied, such RF as DLP, AH, 
EBW, and smoking, were observed individually and in various 
combinations more often in physical laborers. It should be 
emphasized that RF combinations were encountered in both 
intellectual workers and physical laborers substantially more 
often in populations living in the European part of the CIS and 
Siberia, while the frequency of identification of RF was 
significantly lower in men from the Central Asian region. 
  Comparative data on the prevalence of RF individually and in 
various combinations as a function of the educational level of 
the men are presented in Table 3. The presence of one RF was 
observed substantially more often in Moscow, Tallinn, and 
Alma-Ata in individuals with secondary and elementary education. 
RF were recorded individually more often in men with elementary 
education among those from Tallinn and Novosibirsk. DLP was 
found significantly more frequently in men with higher education 
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Kiev, Alma-Ata, and Bishkek. 
Whereas, the frequency of smoking was substantially higher in 
individuals with elementary education in Moscow, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, and Alma-Ata. Further, the prevalence of smoking in 
men in Moscow, Tallinn, and Alma-Ata with elementary and 
secondary education was higher than in individuals with higher 
education. The frequency of identification of smoking in men 
with higher and secondary education from St. Petersburg and 
Bishkek was significantly higher than in individuals with 
elementary education. The prevalence of AH separately was 
somewhat greater in individuals with higher education, but 
significant differences were observed only in Tallinn and 
Novosibirsk. The presence of RF individually in the male 
population from Tashkent did not depend on the educational 
level. Smoking was the most prevalent RF in the men; its 
frequency was higher in individuals with elementary education, 
whereas DLP and AH were encountered somewhat more often in men 
with secondary and higher education.

  Combinations of two RF were encountered more often in 
Moscow, 
Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, and Tashkent in individuals with 
elementary education. The prevalence of a combination of two RF 
was higher in the men of St. Petersburg and Bishkek only in 
individuals with secondary education. A combination of two RF in 
Moscow in men with elementary and secondary education was 
identified significantly more frequently than in men with higher 
education. DLP and smoking were included in a combination of two 
RF most often. Such a combination was observed more often in 
subjects with elementary education in Tallinn, Alma-Ata, 
Novosibirsk, and Tashkent. The prevalence of the combination of 
AH and smoking was also higher in men with elementary education 
among the subjects from Moscow and Novosibirsk. The combination 
of DLP and AH was encountered significantly more often in men 
with higher education in Tallinn and Novosibirsk. The prevalence 
of such RF combinations as AH and EBW and EBW and smoking did 
not depend on the menUs educational level. 
  The prevalence of combinations if three RF overall did not 
depend on the menUs educational level, although there was a 
tendency in the majority of the populations to the more frequent 
identification of a combination of three RF and individuals with 
elementary education (see Table 3). 
  RF were observed significantly more frequently in 
individuals 
with elementary education in the populations of Moscow, Tallinn, 
Novosibirsk, Alma-Ata, and Tashkent; they were identified at a 
frequency ranging from 65.3 to 81.5%. The prevalence of 
RF in 
Moscow, Tallinn, and Alma-Ata in men with secondary education 
was substantially higher than in individuals with higher 
education, but at the same time lower than in men with 
elementary education. RF were identified significantly more 
often in the men of St. Petersburg and Bishkek in those with 
secondary education. The prevalence of RF in Kiev was 
significantly higher in individuals with secondary education 
than in those with higher and elementary education. At the same 
time, the frequency of identification of RF in men with higher 
education from Kiev was substantially higher than in individuals 
with elementary education. 
  Thus, the results of the investigations suggest that RF as a 
whole, depending on the character of the work activity and 
educational level of the men, were encountered more often among 
populations living in the cities of the European region, 
Siberia, and less often, in men of the Central Asian region. The 
highest prevalence of RF individually and in various 
combinations, as well as in relation to the character of work 
and educational level, was observed in the men from Novosibirsk 
and Tallinn. 
  Discussion 
  It was established, when populations of men were examined on 
the basis of a unified program and standard methods, that there 
were RF separately and in various combinations in the majority 
of the men in cities of various regions of the CIS and Estonia; 
at the same time, the level of RF was higher in the cities of 
the European part and Siberia, while RF were recorded 
substantially less frequently in the men of the Central Asian 
region. Smoking and DLP were most prevalent among the RF studied 
in the populations. DLP and smoking were included in a 
combination of two RF most often; DLP, smoking, and AH, in a 
combination of three RF. Very similar data have also been 
obtained in other population studies. Thus, RF were found when 
men 20-59 years of age in Moscow were examined in 76%; at 
the 
same time, smoking was the most prevalent RF [12]. Similar data 
have been obtained for other populations as well [2, 5, 20]. 
When 522 inhabitants of the island of Newfoundland were 
examined, RF were identified in 78%; HCH (61% at 
CH criteria 
&gt;  200 mg/dl), EBW, and smoking were encountered most 
frequently 
[23]. 
  RF were observed more often in our investigation in physical 
laborers. Differences in the RF level among intellectual workers 
and physical laborers were determined first of all by a higher 
frequency of smoking and its combinations with DLP and AH. In 
other investigations carried out in populations from the CIS, 
also among men engaged in physical labor, a higher prevalence of 
smoking and its combinations with other RF was observed [3, 13, 
15]. Data are available regarding the higher prevalence of RF 
individually and in various combinations among workers of 
industrial enterprises of Norilsk [16]. 
  When the men were studied in relation to educational level, 
we established that the frequency of RF individually and in 
different combinations has an inverse relationship to the 
educational level. The highest level of RF is observed in the 
majority of populations in individuals with elementary 
education; a lower level, in men with higher education. A 
similar relationship of the prevalence of RF as a function of 
educational level was identified in populations from Minneapolis 
(USA) and Australia [28, 29]. 
  Conclusions 
  1. For men living in various cities of the CIS, a high 
prevalence of risk factors (RF) individually and in various 
combinations, is characteristic; at the same time, the RF level 
is substantially higher in men from the European part and 
Siberia than in populations from the Central Asian region. 
  2. In descending order with respect to frequency of 
identification, the following RF are most prevalent among the 
men of the various cities of the CIS: smoking, 
dyslipoproteinemia (DLP), arterial hypertension (AH), and 
excessive body weight (EBW). DLP and smoking are included in a 
combination of two RF most often; DLP, AH, and smoking in a 
combination of three. 
  3. The prevalence of RF individually and in various 
combinations depends on the character of the work activity of 
the men: the level of RF is higher in men engaged in physical 
labor than in individuals engaged in intellectual work. 
  4. The prevalence of RF separately and in various 
combinations as a function of educational level, exhibits an 
inverse relationship: the highest RF level is observed in men 
with elementary education, the lowest in men with higher 
education.
