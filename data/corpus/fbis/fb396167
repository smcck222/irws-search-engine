  [Text] Growth of industrialization in the world was marked 
over the last 100 years by extremely fast increase in power 
consumption (by almost 25 times), which led to the use of 11.4 
billion tonnes of equivalent fuel in the world annually. 
However, in addition to the positive effect of 
industrialization, there are also negative factors, and one of 
the main ones is pollution of the atmosphere and planetary 
climate change, evoked by disturbance of the atmosphere's gas 
composition and the radiant heat balance as a result of 
accumulation of the combustion products of fossil fuels in the 
atmosphere. 
  The principal components of atmospheric pollution are oxides 
of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon. The toxic effects of some 
substances released by enterprises and forming as a result of 
human economic activity are described in Table 1. 
  Power generating facilities are among the principal 
polluters 
of the atmosphere (approximately 30 percent) [2]. Power supply 
sources of the Belarusian Republic currently consume around 65 
million tonnes of equivalent fuel per year, with around 90 
percent of the fuel and energy resources being supplied from 
Russia. Extraction of fuel and energy resources locally in 
Belarus in 1985 totaled: petroleum--2.0 million tonnes, gas--0.2 
billion nm[.sup]3[/], peat--4.5 million tonnes. On the other 
hand consumption just by power generating facilities, without 
regard for municipal heat supply sources not within the 
structure of the Belglavenergo TEO [not further identified], is 
shown in Table 2 [3]. 
  As follows from Table 2, the principal fuel of power 
generating facilities is fuel oil--48.7 percent. Consequently 
components released into the atmosphere as a result of its 
combustion, namely ash, soot, nitric oxides, sulfur dioxides and 
carbon monoxide, will be the environmental pollutants associated 
with generation of electric power in the Belarusian Republic.

  The concentration of toxic releases is determined by public 
health norms. Most important are the maximum one-time and the 
mean daily maximum permissible concentrations (PDKs) of toxins 
in the atmosphere. Table 3 gives the PDKs for several 
atmospheric pollutants adopted in the Belarusian Republic 
(PDK[.sup]max o[/]--one-time, PDK[.sub]m[/]--mean daily). 
  In order to meet the PDKs indicated in Table 3, we need to 
organize the fuel combustion process or provide the technology 
of purifying the fuel or the smoke gases. As a rule, for 
practical purposes the problems of purifying exhaust gases at 
power supply sources planned in countries of the former USSR 
were not addressed, and all of the attention was devoted to the 
fuel combustion process. However, while we can reduce toxic 
releases of N0[.sup]x[/] by improving the combustion process, 
SO[.sup]2[/] practically remains at its initial 
concentrations. Therefore to reduce toxic releases of 
SO[.sup]2[/], we need to furnish power supply sources using 
fossil fuel with purification systems. This of course makes the 
supplied electric power more expensive, but it improves the 
ecological situation at the locations of the power supply 
sources, and consequently reduces the risk of illness in the 
population.

  There are presently a rather large number of methods of 
removing SO[.sup]2[/] from gaseous releases. Some 
characteristics of these methods are given in Table 4. 
  As follows from Table 4, the SO[.sup]2[/] removing systems 
considered here are approximately identical in terms of their 
relative indicators. However, the cathode-ray methods do not 
require expendable materials, and moreover, they provide for 
comprehensive removal of NO[.sup]x[/] and SO[.sub]2[/] 
[5,6]. Furnishing power supply sources using fossil fuel with 
systems for removing toxic gaseous exhausts makes the supplied 
power 40-50 percent more expensive. It should be considered, 
however, that in this case the amount of the fines for toxic 
releases decreases. 
  Because many industrial enterprises, including those 
generating electric and thermal power, are unable to reduce 
releases below the PDV [maximum permissible release], on 11 May 
1990 the Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Republic adopted 
Decree No 119 ``On Standards of Charges for Releases 
(Discharges) of Pollutants Into the Natural Environment.'' The 
charges were introduced with the purpose of compensating for 
releases at the level of the PDV, with a coefficient of 0.1 for 
thermal power facilities, and a charge five times greater for 
surpassing them, depending on the danger class of the toxic 
substances. Table 5 gives the danger classes for toxic 
substances released together with smoke gases by power supply 
sources using high-sulfur fuel oil as fuel, and the cost per 
tonne of released substance.

  The damages caused by toxic releases from power supply 
sources burning high-sulfur fuel (around 20,000) [sic] were 
evaluated using procedures presented in [6-8]. The calculation 
results are shown in Table 6. 
  Considering that a tendency for land prices to increase is 
being observed, the amount of the damages will also grow. 
Consequently when planning and building power supply sources, we 
need to consider the damages inflicted both on the environment 
and on human health. For practical purposes the latter factor is 
not yet reflected in the procedural recommendations for 
calculating damages.

Institute, under the rubric of ``Environmental Data Collection 
and Processing Systems''] 
  [Text] Under the conditions of today's scientific and 
engineering revolution, the development of mankind's productive 
forces has reached a level at which almost the entire surface of 
the planet is involved in the production process. Furthermore, 
industrial development of the country has run into the problem 
of a sharp deterioration in environmental conditions. 
  The resolution of environmental problems is closely related 
to the availability to the society of the hardware capable of 
effectively monitoring the conditions (parameters) of the 
environment and humans living in it. The tasks of this 
monitoring are diverse: determining the composition and 
concentrations of small impurities with a natural or man-made 
origin; measuring the physical environment condition parameters 
(temperature, pressure, moisture content, velocity of air and 
water masses, etc.); and examining the energy and mass transfer 
among the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. 
  This section of the journal is primarily dedicated to the 
studies and developments carried out by the Taganrog Radio 
Engineering Institute (TRTI) in the field of environmental 
monitoring and medical and biological diagnostics of the 
functional status of humans. The Taganrog Radio Engineering 
Institute is one of the largest academic, scientific, and 
production complexes in the Northern Caucasian region and 
consists of an institution of higher learning, a scientific 
research institute, two design offices, an experimental pilot 
base, and problem-oriented and industrial laboratories. 
  In the framework of the republic-wide program of ``ecology 
and environmental protection in the Russian Federation,'' the 
Institute's scientists are developing sensors and transducers 
for monitoring the environmental parameters, hardware for remote 
sensing of the environment, computer and data networks, 
environmental information display systems, and expert systems 
for the on-line assessment and prediction of the environmental 
conditions. 
  The Institute has a considerable stock of research already 
completed in each of these fields as well as the necessary 
scientific potential and experimental base. Moisture content, 
temperature, pressure, water vapor, smoke, NO gas, and ammonium 
sensors have already been developed at the Institute. Elements 
of secondary transducers of physical quantities have been 
developed and manufactured in a micro-electronic form. Remote 
sensing methods have been implemented in radar and laser 
instruments for detecting and mapping the water surface 
contamination and soil moisture content and for detecting 
groundwater. Scientific and research work on developing a 
station for monitoring gas discharges, systems for collecting 
and processing environmental data, and nonlinear hydroacoustic 
instruments for remote measurement of the thickness of sludge 
deposits resulting from industrial enterprise discharges have 
been carried out at the complex. 
  Equipment and software for the diagnostic-recovery center 
are 
being developed and manufactured at the Institute; it contains 
the following: 

  -  a model of a computer-aided system for monitoring the 
health of workers under the conditions of their productive 
activity developed on the basis of a computer 
  -  a psychological and physiological status simulator developed 
on 
the basis of a microcomputer together with a color graphics 
display and a module for recording physiological parameters 
(pulse rate, breathing rate, temperature, and skin potential) as 
well as electric stimulation facilities; 
  -  a SKENAR-type energy neurostimulator which was developed and 
manufactured for measured application of electric pulses for 
therapeutic purposes on reflexogenic segments of the skin cover 
in patients with diseases of the peripheral nervous system, 
skeletomuscular system traumas, or to be used as an auxiliary 
facility in respiratory diseases, in the initial stages of 
cardiovascular system diseases; it will be used starting from 
the foundation of scientific research, subsequent execution of 
experimental design work on its basis, and all the way to the 
production of pilot prototypes and pilot batches of the 
instruments being developed. Moreover, the Taganrog Radio 
Engineering Institute complex has accumulated considerable 
potential in the field of information science and computer 
science which makes it possible to automate the collection and 
processing of environmental and medical and biological data and 
develop a system of regional ecological data banks and knowledge 
bases. This is especially important since contacts have been 
made at an international level: a joint Soviet-Italian 
enterprise, contacts with Czecho-Slovakia, contacts with 
Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany, etc. 
  This issue of the journal contains applied articles 
dealing with the problem of monitoring the environmental 
parameters recommended for publication by the scientific and 
engineering seminar ``Radiophysical Methods in Environmental 
Research'' and by the coordinating center for organizing 
scientific research at the RSFSR State Committee on Science and 
Higher Education. 
  Moreover, the issue also contains the findings of research 
in 
related fields carried out by scientists from other institutions 
of higher learning.

  [Text]The sorry state of ecology makes even natural 
foodstuffs less and less suitable for consumption. And industry 
has to carry out increasingly thorough purification of such 
food. In particular, milk is usually treated with ion-exchange 
resins. These sorbents have the remarkable capacity to absorb 
numerous impurities: radionuclides, pesticides, heavy metals, 
and even excessive acidity, thus transforming ``poor'' milk into 
milk that is quite suitable for boiling. 
  Until recently, only small batches of milk intended for 
small 
children were submitted to such treatment, but after Chernobyl 
its' use increased dramatically in a number of oblasts. Then 
there appeared the problem of disposing of radioactive waste, 
which is quite sizable with use of this technology. Ion-exchange 
resins must be cleaned periodically in salt solutions, which 
then become the radioactive waste, which is quite significant 
(about 10 percent of the volume of treated milk) and hazardous 
(because of the high cesium-137 content). 
  The Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian Academy of 
Sciences, together with the All-Union Research Institute of the 
Dairy Industry were able to "take care of" radioactive salt 
solutions by including their treatment in the technological 
process. For this purpose, a new sorbent was developed, a 
modified zeolite that selectively binds expressly cesium-137. 
True, it becomes radioactive waste after use, but its volume is 
one-fiftieth of the level in salt solutions. 
  The modified zeolite can also be used for direct removal of 
cesium-137 from milk. This is particularly valuable for farmers 
who do not handle large batches of milk, but have enough time to 
inactivate it for a somewhat longer decontamination. Especially 
since, in this case, no special equipment is required. The 
sorbent does not get clogged with either protein or fat. The 
treatment method has been tested at the Moscow Medical Academy 
imeni I. M. Sechenov and its use is recommended. 
  It is technologically simple and inexpensive to manufacture 
the modified zeolite. The base material, naturally occurring 
zeolite, is available in sufficient amounts in the nation. But, 
unfortunately, there is no manufacturer as yet.

Logunov, corresponding member, International Engineering 
Academy, and V.D. Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences,

  [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification 
of production, the problem of environmental protection and 
rational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly 
socially and economically significant. Included among the 
matters classified under this problem are the following: 
pollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic 
chemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful 
consequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and 
diseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and 
recultivation; further development of the legal bases of 
environmental protection; and economic assessment of natural 
resources. 
  The development of production, scientific and engineering 
progress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not 
destroy the harmony that has been established in nature or 
destroy natural resources. There are no wastes in nature: All 
biological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed 
circle. 
  All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some 
degree or other. Research has shown that at least one third of 
all processible raw material is now transformed into finished 
products. Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials 
becomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment. In the 
past decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the 
atmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial 
development has increased sharply and continues to increase. 
Each year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power 
plants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and 
other machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in 
the form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the 
atmosphere. 
  The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world 
is 
absorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium 
in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been 
upset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding 
louder with each passing year. The continuing increase in the 
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an 
especially negative phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is known to be 
toxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated 
respiration and cardiac activity. An increase in carbon dioxide 
concentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also 
facilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal 
radiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate 
warming throughout the entire planet. As is known, in the past 
100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface 
increased by 0.5-0.6ë, which has in turn accelerated glacial 
thawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m. 
  Also released along with carbon dioxide during the 
combustion 
process is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect 
and which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, 
including illness of the central nervous system. 
  Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large 
amount of sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels also contain a great deal 
of sulfur. Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are 
released in our country. When sulfur dioxide reacts with 
atmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form. When 
nitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed 
that combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and 
nitric acids. These acids may cause serious lung diseases. 
  Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated 
on the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the 
atmosphere. 
  In nature, everything is interconnected. Toxic impurities 
that end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of 
precipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and 
vegetable gardens. Polluted precipitation also falls into water 
reservoirs. The acids contained in precipitation react with 
metals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc.) in the soil, and 
they infect the water and thus the fish. 
  Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution. 
Industrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into 
water reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes 
can no longer be cleaned with existing resources. The natural 
purity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost. 
Phosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as 
fertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them. 
The situation regarding irrigation water is no better. Its 
chemical composition largely dictates the quality of 
agricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, 
phosphates, and metals has also risen. Countries with a high 
technological discipline permit the use of relatively small 
amounts of fertilizer. In countries with a lower technological 
discipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase 
crop yields. As a rule, this results in a decline in product 
quality. 
  And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, 
the environment shortens their life. The child mortality rate in 
many countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries 
it has even begun to increase. Studies conducted by the World 
Health Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead 
content was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates. 
Where is the way out? 
  Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further 
destruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a 
planetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not 
to extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective 
capabilities. Understanding of the fact that people's lives 
truly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become 
widespread. 
  It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to 
regulate man's relationship with nature have been developed. In 
the developed countries, where the economy is subject to market 
relationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed 
intensively. This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, 
consequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. 
The manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust 
gases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities. 
  Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is 
being conducted at the international, state, and sector levels. 
Many countries regularly exchange information about the current 
condition of the environment and are creating a common 
ecological data bank. 
  Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently 
actively engaged in this process. And the situation in our 
country cannot be called good. According to existing data, about 
30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster 
areas. Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of 
restoring and protecting nature as priority problems. 
  Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more 
than two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements 
specified in standards. Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial 
wastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are 
transported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized 
storage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials 
ending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in 
infection of the plant and animal world. 
  Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy 
has long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is 
a definite contributor to these negative consequences of 
economic activity. 
  Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form 
of gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout 
the sector as a whole. From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units 
trap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 
tonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes 
throughout the country, are released into the atmosphere. 
Considering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located 
in cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough 
standards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely 
populated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect 
of the sector's production on the environment is not always 
adequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic 
materials. In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume 
percentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal 
power plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), 
painting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 
percent). The sector's production is characterized by a long 
list of wastes. And although solid particles and hydrocarbons 
predominate in the composition of toxic materials generated 
(they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual 
enterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and 
compounds into the air medium. 
  Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding 
and core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other 
wastes are generated at the sector's enterprises. Of that 
amount, 800,000 tons is toxic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of 
abrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, 
chromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for 
industry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are 
released each year. 
  According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector 
enterprises 
throughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated 
consists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and 
other types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum 
products (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 
percent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, 
slags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, 
highly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after 
regeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and 
varnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes. 
  The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's 
production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste 
technologies and equipment have not yet become basic and 
binding. It should be noted, however, that the sector's 
institutes are definitely working in this direction. 
  The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless 
melting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting 
by using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible 
to significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce 
the toxicity of wastes (slags). Also noteworthy from the 
standpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the 
toxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a 
process and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of 
aluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in 
layers. The process has been introduced on a wide scale at 
aviation industry enterprises and in other sectors. 
  Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of 
titanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder 
obtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way. 
This will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins). 
  From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and 
equipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of 
casting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, 
and neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them 
at sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work. 
  In the past few years, the following ecologically promising 
low-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components 
have been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of 
components used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws 
and cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating 
magnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum 
or sulfur hexafluoride gas). This has made it possible to cut 
emissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3. 
  In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; 
Defectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector 
enterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following 
low-waste processes and equipment: 
  -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic 
cutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of 
grinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine 
materials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration 
of cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil 
residues from the water in spent cutting fluids. The cost 
savings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles; 
  -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing 
coatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that 
has made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a 
factor of 5 or 6; 
  -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of 
blades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent; 
  -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics 
(glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the 
manufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises 
instead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's 
type); 
  -- a process for finishing precision components of 
fuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of 
finishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced 
consumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into 
the atmosphere by a factor of 3. 
  In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the 
following have been developed: 
  -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness 
based on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication 
instead of the oil-and-whiting method; 
  -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of 
pneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized 
water and a stand for comprehensive development of 
pneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas 
(nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive 
helium. 
  In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce 
television-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was 
done in 1990-1992. This type of inspection may replace the x-ray 
and magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of 
magnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the 
use of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the 
inspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and 
fixative wastes. In the case of the television-magnetic method, 
there are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple 
times. 
  Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible 
to 
reduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, 
nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere, eliminate 
contamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly 
flammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the 
volatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the 
sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of 
water sources by petroleum products, etc. 
  Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with 
respect to ecological improvement of production and creation of 
new low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above 
data, still difficult to call this activity purposive and 
effective. 
  To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise 
during aviation operations. The "greenhouse" gases 
CO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides 
form as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine. Efforts are 
currently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce 
nitrogen oxide wastes. 
  The only way of significantly reducing or completely 
eliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such 
as liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen. The development of 
cryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate 
aviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves. 
  Development and assimilation of the following 
processes/equipment are planned as priority directions of 
ecological improvement over the next few years: 
  -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash 
components and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of 
commercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other 
health-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it 
possible to economize fuel and raw material resources; 
  -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer 
coatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic 
field that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent 
vapors and aerosols in the atmosphere; 
  -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium 
used when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine 
components by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that 
will result in an ecologically pure technological process; 
  -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure 
technological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory 
alloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor 
of 6-8; 
  -- a process and automated chambers for 
microcomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of 
coatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process 
by 25 percent on average. 
  These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the 
following: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed 
dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc.) into the atmosphere; 
eliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; 
improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate 
pollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and 
reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products. 
  The development of science-intensive processes and equipment 
and their introduction into industry are still far from 
adequate. One of the main distinguishing features of 
science-intensive technologies and production is the fact that 
they require little raw material and energy (i.e., they are more 
resource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are 
used are not great. Water consumption in these processes is also 
much lower than in conventional industrial processes, which 
ultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage. 
  Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, 
and progressive casting are among those resource-saving 
low-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially 
significant for the sector's production on an ecological plane. 
  The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these 
problems is another very important reason why the work that is 
being done with respect to ecological improvement of industry 
and creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes 
has not been effective enough. 
  According to the standard international classification 
system, the aviation sector is among the 10 most 
science-intensive sectors. It is understood that the task of 
switching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste 
processes in the present period under the conditions of the 
systems of economic relationships that have developed in the 
sector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and 
large become the main source of financing R&amp;D, is rather 
difficult. 
  One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a 
systems approach is that of developing a special integrated 
environmental protection program. The foundation of this program 
consists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the 
sector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving 
low-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all 
stages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the 
purpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility. 
  The technological measures planned by the sector should be 
based on priority directions, including those in the field of 
ecological improvement of the sector's production as determined 
first and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of 
production and processes, and materials with the biggest 
negative effect on the environment. 
  The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology 
program must contain a number of subprograms in different 
directions of environmental protection activity. Specifically, 
each subsector must have a separate program of operations to 
create a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and 
neutralizing production and consumption wastes. 
  Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of 
attention as a tool that makes it possible to make a 
scientifically well founded decision regarding the need to 
develop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and 
further develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, 
equipment, and materials that are in use. 
  In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it 
possible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible 
negative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of 
the sector's production on the environment. What is needed most 
on this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector 
institutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of 
the methodological, standards and related reference information, 
and technical-organizational support of such an expert 
evaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and 
enterprises. The expert evaluation should be based on a 
comprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several 
directions, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's 
atmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc. 
  The sector's institutes now have the materials required to 
conduct expert evaluations. For example, they now have the 
following: normative-reference material related to determining 
indicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's 
manufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of 
all industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to 
the basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with 
consideration for its quality; a method of calculating the 
quantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials 
into the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing 
equipment at the sector's enterprises; a 
normative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of 
materials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors 
for use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector 
methodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions 
form aircraft engines. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health 
and other industrial sectors also have a number of 
methodological materials. 
  A group of environmental protection specialists at the NIID 
are conducting a systematic check of completed scientific 
research work and newly developed and improved technological 
processes to analyze their effect on the environment and their 
conformity to the requirements of environmental protection 
legislation so as to prevent the introduction of technological 
processes that do not meet the requirements of environmental 
protection and rational use of natural resources. 
  The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and 
in enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the 
required body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great 
importance in this respect. 
  Only when specialists have in-depth knowledge of the 
interaction of nature and society, the consequences of 
industrial pollution of the environment, rational methods and 
ways of using nature, the requirements of environmental 
protection legislation, ways of protecting the environment 
against industrial emissions, ways of estimating the damage done 
to nature, and other matters will they be capable of actively 
introducing expert ecological examinations into the sector, 
increasing its quality, and consequently producing a product 
that is not ecologically harmful. 
  Purposive and effective work toward ecological improvement 
of 
the sector's production based on resource-saving and low-waste 
technology is impossible without significant improvement of 
organizational work in this direction. 
  In this regard, special attention must be paid to developing 
organizational methodological materials to support the use of 
recyclable material resources in the national economy. 
  The problem of increasing the effectiveness and rational use 
of recyclable material resources is one of the most important 
problems in the sector's production. Hundreds of thousands of 
tons of recyclable material resources pile up at the sector's 
enterprises each year. Table 1 presents the volumes of the 
generation, use, and destruction of recyclable material 
resources in the sector in 1991. It is evident from Table 1 that 
between 4 and 83 percent of recyclable material resources is 
destroyed depending on the type of resource. The main thrust of 
the sector's economic strategy is effective use of recyclable 
material resources in production, the main directions of which 
are presented in Table 2.

Note: RMR = recyclable material resources 


  Solving this problem requires a new systems approach to 
using 
all recyclable material resources. Recently, the recovery of raw 
material resources from wastes has become a matter of 
governmental importance in many developed countries. Unused 
recyclable material resources require significant expenditures 
for storage (or burial). In addition, burying them aggravates 
the ecological situation. 
  Reducing the volume of industrial wastes and making rational 
use of them reduces the size of dumps and the costs of 
maintaining them. About 2 million hectares of land in our 
country are currently used as dumps. The dumps become full in an 
average of 4-5 years, after which new dump sites must be found. 
The territory occupied by dumps can only be recovery after 10-20 
years. The area of land withdrawn from circulation is therefore 
constantly increasing. 
  Today, it is important that the public understand that 
the solution to economic and ecological problems is not 
purification equipment, on which enormous funds are spent, but 
rather no-waste technology and reprocessing of recyclable 
material resources. 
  When recyclable material resources are reprocessed, 
environmental pollution is reduced by 40-45 percent versus when 
primary resources are used, and capital expenditures are 4-5 
times lower than the costs of obtaining and processing 
comparable types of primary resources. Obtaining 1 ton steel 
from scrap metal, for example, requires 80 percent less energy 
than the entire cycle to produce steel from iron ore does. 
Reusing 100 million bottles makes it possible to save 30,000 
tons of sand, 10,000 tons of soda, 6,000 tons of oil, 18 million 
kwh of electric power, and 15 million m[.sup]3[/] of gas. 
Producing 1 tonne of lubricating oils based on spent product 
will save 6 tons of oil, and 1 ton of rag wool will yield about 
700 kg of recovered wool. Using waste paper when manufacturing 
paper makes it possible to reduce air pollution by 46 percent 
and water pollution by 25-45 percent. 
  When assessing the feasibility of investing large 
amounts of funds in the creation of some new facilities to 
produce different types of products, it is thus necessary to 
bear in mind that in most cases it is much more advantageous 
from both economic and ecological standpoints to spend funds to 
improve existing production processes through more in-depth 
processing of raw material. In such cases, the amount of 
additional product may be produced in much shorter time periods 
and at a lower cost. In addition, toxic emissions into the 
environment are significantly reduced. 
  It should be noted that the existing methods of estimating 
the use of production wastes and their demand only consider the 
savings from selling the additional product obtained. The scales 
of the true effect of introducing a recovery process are 
depressed because the reduction of economic damage due to 
environmental pollution is not considered. 
  The total savings from using recyclable material resources 
consists of the profit obtained from selling the product made of 
recyclable material resources, eliminating their removal and 
burial costs, reducing transport costs, freeing ground occupied 
by dumps and disposal sites, and reducing expenditures on 
environmental protection. Socio-economic criteria that give 
consideration to both the effect of producing a product and the 
social results of preventing the release of toxic materials into 
the environment must be used when estimating the savings 
resulting from using recyclable material resources. 
  Extraction and processing of materials for use in the very 
same production processes for the second and, in some cases, the 
third time is the main direction in making use of industrial 
wastes abroad. The membrane process and ion-exchange method have 
gained the greatest popularity. Specifically, they permit 
economically profitable processing of effluent after 
electrochemical treatment of solutions both with a low salt 
content (when units are washed) and in concentrated solutions 
(spent electrolytes). 
  For effluent with a low salt content, an ion-exchange filter 
is used. After that, the purified and desalinated (up to 90 
percent) water is returned to the unit for electrochemical 
treatment, and the concentrate is subjected to additional 
treatment either for regeneration and reuse or else for 
neutralization. Japanese specialists have developed ion-exchange 
filters for continuous purification of the washing waters of 
electrochemical processing units. The filter has ion-exchange 
cassettes or replaceable-type cartridges.

  Methods based on the membrane process are considered more 
promising for concentrated solutions. Different types of 
electrolyzers, i.e., with plate-type and three-dimensional 
porous electrodes, are used in the units created in Germany and 
Japan. Filter elements based on hollow fibers produced by the 
American firms Dupont, Westinghouse, and Dow Chemical have 
become popular. Sleeve-type membranes produced by the firm 
General Dynamics (the United States) made of the drain material 
Tricot with a packing density of 720 
m[.sup]2[/]/m[.sup]3[/] are in demand. 
  Wastes from the production of printed circuit boards are 
widely used abroad for electrochemical regeneration of 
cuprammonium solutions in electrolyzers in which the anode and 
cathode spaces are separated by an ion-exchange membrane. During 
the regeneration process, the spent solution circulates 
continuously in the anode chamber, where it is oxidized and 
returned to the etcher. Copper ions pass through the membrane 
into the cathode chamber, where they are deposited on the 
cathode in the form of a metal powder. The unit has a capacity 
of 3 kg of pure copper per hour (the URT-901 unit used in the 
sector has a capacity of 1 kg/h). The firms Finishing Service 
(Great Britain) and Gell-Muller (Germany) series-produce units 
for electrochemical regeneration combined with alkaline etching 
lines. 
  About 240 million old tires are discarded in the United 
States each year. As secondary materials, they are burned as 
fuel, used to manufacture rough home flooring and landing mats 
for aircraft, mixed with asphalt and used in laying sidewalks, 
used to manufacture drain pipes and enclosures, etc. In 
addition, the state of Pennsylvania is conducting a project to 
activate used rubber so as to chemically bind it with plastics 
for the purpose of transforming old rubber into a polymeric 
composite material suitable for manufacturing hoses, gaskets, 
rollers, and even new tires. The method entails grinding worn 
tires into powder and adding it to plastics to form a composite 
mixture. Calculations performed at the NIID indicate that more 
than 90 percent of wastes may be reprocessed and used in the 
interests of the national economy. 
  Ninety percent of wastes from the sawmilling and woodworking 
industry are used, as are 98 percent of polystyrene wastes. The 
savings of primary polystyrene thanks to the use of 1 tonne of 
secondary polystyrene averages 986 kg for the subsector. In the 
subsector, wastes from the sawmilling industry are used for 
manufacturing particle board and mail (postal) boxes, 
constructing temporary structures in the sector's own ancillary 
facilities, and selling to state farms and collective farms 
(sawdust) and the public (trim, slabs, and lumber that has 
already been used). Polystyrene wastes are used to produce 
components for basic production, industrial-engineering goods, 
cultural and general goods, and goods intended for sale in the 
economy. 
  Sector enterprises obtain some woodworking and polystyrene 
wastes from other enterprises in the region for processing and 
use in their own production. One plant, for example, has at its 
own initiative found a profitable method of reprocessing a large 
volume of sawmilling and woodworking wastes from enterprises of 
various sectors throughout the region. Yearly production of 
particle board averages 1,500 m[.sup]2[/] with an economic 
impact of 530,000 rubles yearly. Each year, the Vpered [Forward] 
Machine Building Plant in Moscow uses sawmilling and polystyrene 
wastes to manufacture hangers, motor vehicle and door handles, 
bread baskets, candlesticks, cutting boards, decorative 
spatulas, and small serving tables in quantities of 450,000 
units each year for an economic impact of 370,000 rubles. 
  The Gidromash [Hydraulic Machinery] Production Association 
(Nizhniy Novgorod) uses polystyrene wastes to produce household 
goods in quantities of 500,000 units each year with an economic 
impact of 420,000 rubles. It should be noted that enterprises in 
the subsector sell polystyrene wastes mainly to manufacturing 
organizations. A fairly insignificant amount of woodworking and 
sawmilling wastes are transported to dumps, buried, or destroyed. 
  The NIID has evaluated the ecological situation in the 
sector 
in relation to the recovery of slime wastes generated during the 
electrochemical treatment of gas turbine engine components and 
subassemblies. According to data obtained from sector 
enterprises, there is a total of 1,572 tons of slime each year. 
Of that amount, 251 tonnes are recovered, and the rest is 
transported to a dump. Titanium-containing slimes, which amount 
to 947 tons a year, are particularly valuable. It should be 
noted that the processing sectors of industry, for example, the 
paint-and-varnish and construction sectors, are not especially 
interested in this quantity of slime. The principles of no-waste 
technology require that these wastes be included in 
technological chains, however. The NIID has conducted an 
information search and identified 20 technologies in which 
recyclable material resources containing titanium slimes may be 
used. The MMPO imeni Chernyshev [expansion not given] and 
Nitrogen Industry Institute have, for example, developed a 
process for using titanium slimes to prepare Claus oxide 
catalyst to replace imported catalyst in sulfur production. The 
design of a shop to reprocess titanium slime to produce 
refractory alloys has been proposed at the Novomoskovsk Chemical 
Combine. 
  The use of worn-down mounted abrasive points is very 
important for our sector. A survey of enterprises revealed 2,545 
tonnes of such points generated during 1991. Enterprises in the 
sector use abrasive point wastes for various technological 
purposes. At the Salyut MMPO, for example, 24.5 percent of its 
120 tons of waste is sold to manufacturing organizations, and 
53.9 percent is recovered. Of the 125 tons of waste at the MMPO 
imeni Chernyshev, 84.3 percent is sold, 15.2 percent is 
recovered, and 0.5 percent is used in vibration tumblers. 
  Most worn-down mounted abrasive points are thus sold to 
manufacturing organizations, and only a small part are used for 
technological or production purposes. 
  Removal of an aluminized coating (during repair) and ceramic 
cores from single-crystal blades in a fluoride salt melt is a 
progressive direction. A significant amount of the slime 
generated after regeneration of the fluoride salts is used to 
produce construction materials. At the Rybinsk Motor Building 
Production Association, the economic impact from the 
introduction of this process has amounted to 462,000 rubles a 
year (in 1991 prices). 
  Several hundreds of tons of tungsten- and cobalt-containing 
wastes is generated each year at the subsector's enterprises 
during the process of pointing and using hard-alloy cutting 
tools. Eighty percent of the weight of all of the solid alloy 
obtained is in lump form, and 20 percent of the weight of the 
wastes from resharpened hard plates is in dust form. The 
enterprises and the NIID have jointly organized sections to 
collect the metal lumps and dust. The economic impact of the 
introduction of these sections has been about 180,000 rubles at 
each enterprise. 
  A technology for reprocessing wastes from grinding and 
pointing cutting tools made of high-speed steel is being 
developed at the institute. At the present time, between 8 and 
12 percent of the high-speed steel used ends up as grinding 
wastes, and up to 70 percent of the cutting portion of a cutting 
tool is ground away during resharpening. Enterprises transport 
these wastes to the dump, where iron and heavy metals (tungsten 
and molybdenum) oxidize and are subsequently leached out into 
the ground waters. Oxidation of chromium and vanadium result in 
the formation of toxic materials. The government pays gold for 
tungsten and molybdenum, and the enterprises send these metals 
into the environment. The newly developed technology makes it 
possible to recover steel powders isolated from the wastes by 
cyclones by remelting them (to produce cast components) and by 
the powder metallurgy method (to manufacture cutting tools). 
  Integrated solution of the problem of using recyclable 
material resources in the national economy will make it possible 
to significantly boost production efficiency and the degree of 
environmental protection. 
  The problem of protecting the environment and using natural 
resources rationally is thus extremely critical for Russia's 
current economy and demands the most in-depth attention and 
active participation on the part of the sector's scientific 
research institutes, associations, and enterprises.

  [Text]As a result of a number of natural 
disasters and technogenic accidents, global changes are 
presently occurring in man's environment, and this makes it 
necessary to develop a new scientific discipline, ecological 
psychology. Formation of radioecological psychology is taking 
place within its limits. The subject of radioecological 
psychology consists of objective facts, patterns and mechanisms 
of development of the human personality, his mental activity in 
the presence of complex interweaving of radioecological and 
sociopsychological factor related to the major nuclear accident 
at the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power plant]. Under such 
conditions, there is dramatic and prolonged mandatory change the 
lifestyle of millions of people, which leads to often 
misunderstood and largely dangerous changes in the mental aspect 
of their life. 
  Radioecological psychology is called upon to demonstrate the 
patterns and mechanisms of occurring changes, assess possible 
consequences and propose adequate ways and means of rendering 
psychological aid to people with consideration of their age-, 
sex-related, individual psychological and sociopsychological 
distinctions. Thus, radioecological psychology is an applied 
scientific discipline. 
  The distinctions of the subject and actual execution of 
deployed research determine the complex nature of formation of 
radio-ecological psychology, which is closely linked with 
psychophysiology, general, medical, age-related, pedagogic, and 
social psychology, as well as sociology, pedagogics, law and 
other disciplines. It utilizes the techniques of experimental 
psychology, psychohygiene, psychotherapy, etc. At the same time, 
within the mainstream of this scientific direction, it is 
developing its own theory, methodology, specific methods of 
investigation and correction of impaired mental development and 
behavior of people who have suffered from the sequelae of the 
radio-ecological disaster. 
  The social relevance and humanitarian orientation of this 
discipline are instrumental in close interaction between 
scientists and practitioners in different specialties residing 
not only in affected country but also in distant foreign lands. 
Beneficial scientific ties are being established between 
psychologists of Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine. Psychologists 
of England, Belgium, Hungary, Germany, the United States, 
France, Japan and other countries are displaying interest in 
these problems and expressing the desire to give scientific and 
practical aid [8]. The ``Children of Chernobyl'' project is 
being implemented under the aegis of UNESCO; it involves 
construction of a number of community centers for 
sociopsychological rehabilitation of children up to the age of 7 
years (in the Ukraine, in Vishnevyy, Kiev Oblast), and 
preparations are under way for opening a UNESCO international 
laboratory in Kiev to work on overcoming the socio-psychological 
and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  There is a history to the formation of radioecological 
psychology in the Ukraine. In the early days and months after 
the accident, it was impossible to determine the nature and 
extent of impact of the radioecological disaster on social and 
psychological phenomena, or to predict their dynamics without 
appropriate studies. 
  The earliest observations in 1986 (for example, those of A. 
U. Kharash from Moscow State University), and subsequent 
purposeful studies (in particular, of the staff of the Ukrainian 
Psychological Research Institute in 1987) were carried out by 
scientists at their own initiative [9]. The findings gave cause 
for serious concern about the social and psychological 
consequences of the accident. The results of observations, 
interrogations and special studies were reported in the form of 
papers and accounts relayed to superior agencies; however, the 
reaction to them was quite restrained, since the findings 
contradicted the official assessment of the sequelae of the 
Chernobyl accident. 
  A comparative study of more than 1300 3d, 5th, 7th and 9th 
grades students -- namely of: a) children evacuated from the 
30-km zone, b) those who remained in the zone of radioactive 
contamination in Zhitomir, Kiev and Chernigov oblasts, c) those 
residing in Kiev, d) a control group from Poltava Oblast -- 
carried out by 16 staff members of the Ukrainian Psychological 
Research Institute in 1987 revealed a number of statistically 
significant differences between them. Thus, the exposed 
students revealed decline in indicators of attention, memory, 
work capacity, impairment in volitional-emotional and emotional 
areas [1]. All this was indicative of sustained stress. Children 
and adolescents evacuated from the 30-km zone were in a 
particularly difficult situation: about 50 percent of them 
experienced serious difficulties in socio-psychological 
adjustment to their new place of residence [2, 3]. 
  A small research team was formed in 1988, which became the 
Children of Chernobyl scientific and practical center in 1990 
(headed by S. I. Yakovenko), to carry out further investigations 
at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute. Several 
articles and methodological recommendations were prepared on the 
basis of their studies [4, 5, 6]. 
  The next step toward deeper investigation of the 
socio-psychological consequences of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES was the Union-Republic Children of Chernobyl 
program approved in 1991. In spite of organizational and 
financial difficulties, it was possible to recruit the nation's 
leading scientific institutions to implement it. In the Ukraine, 
the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute was appointed as 
the head organization (director: A. V. Kirichuk), and 18 of the 
42 topical problems of this program were worked on there. The 
results of its research and clinical work carried out in 1991 
were summarized at the interregional scientific conference on 
``Socio-psychological Rehabilitation of Children and Adolescents 
Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster,'' which convened in February 
1992 in Kiev [8]. 
  The findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: 
The accident at the Chernobyl AES caused catastrophic changes in 
the ecological situation, radical breakdown of the age-old 
lifestyle, system of relations, and made substantial adjustments 
in people's value orientations (first of all, those dealing with 
attitude toward the environment, society, health and rearing 
children). 
  The psycho-traumatic situation that developed after the 
Chernobyl disaster enhanced "centrifugal tendencies" in 
personality development of children and adolescents, which was 
manifested by a tendency toward accentuation of temperament, 
diminished resistance to stress, increased aggressiveness and 
conflict in some, passivity, asthenization, formation of 
consummatory and pension-neurosis mindsets in others. 
  On the whole, the following developmental disturbances were 
typical in children and adolescents who suffered the 
consequences of the Chernobyl accident: --physical: 
asthenization, deterioration of indicators of physical 
readiness, early development of chronic diseases; --mental: 
stress, deadaptation, diminished attention, memory, work 
capacity (including mental work), volitional and emotional 
disturbances, nostalgia for the past and uncertainty about the 
future, diminished motivation, distorted self-appraisal, and 
others; --spiritual: existential crisis, difficulties in 
personal and professional self-assertion, formation and 
persistence of the helpless victim complex doomed to a short and 
difficult life; --social: increased aggressiveness, conflict; 
social apathy, difficulties in communicating (particularly in 
children evacuated from the 30-km condemned zone). 
  In other words, there was a large number of "children who 
had 
gone through a lot," which is not normal in peacetime. 
  At the same time, what had been experienced was, in a number 
of instances, instrumental in intensive formation of the 
personality of affected children and adolescents, appreciable 
improvement in family relations, and others. However, the 
existing positive facts have not yet been reliably aired in 
psychological publications. 
  The following tasks moved to the fore in solving problems of 
sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents in 
the zone of the Chernobyl catastrophe: --determination of 
factors and conditions that arose because of the Chernobyl 
disaster and prevent proper development of children and 
adolescents in the accident zone, and their relationship to 
other concurrently existing factors; --establishment of patterns 
of impact of the aggregate of all existing factors on mental 
development of different territorial and age groups of victims; 
--elaboration of an integral concept of providing for proper 
development of children and adolescents in the zone of the 
Chernobyl disaster; determination of scientific ally validated 
ways and means of rendering the necessary psychological aid to 
victims. 
  The most important factors that hinder proper development of 
children and adolescents in the accident zone are: --external 
and internal radioactive irradiation that is deleterious to 
health and particularly dangerous for children born in 1986; 
--unsatisfactory level of medical care of affected children, 
only 15 percent of whom are under clinical observation; 
--inadequate information given to the public about the 
radioecological situation, safety measures, health status, and 
results of scientists' studies; --distorted image of the 
Chernobyl disaster in the mass media, which are transformed into 
"mass mental traumatization" media, continued circulation of 
various rumors and conjectures that initiate social stress and 
personal anxiety, also affecting children; --deterioration of 
sociodemographic population indicators in the accident zone, 
which is being abandoned by the best educated people who are 
replaced by those who expect only benefits, housing and high 
wages; --erosion of family-relative relations, prolonged 
separation of parents and children during vacations, 
impossibility of restoring previous forms of organization of 
everyday work and leisure; --material and technical difficulties 
in organizing the educational-rearing process in public 
education institutions situated in the zone of rigid radiation 
monitoring (crowded cafeterias, no gyms, ancillary facilities, 
technical educational equipment, etc.), shortage of qualified 
personnel, overfatigue of pedagogues; --inadequate efficacy of 
sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents 
during vacations, its virtual absence at their place of 
residence; --shortage of funds and resources to implement laws 
and enforceable enactments called upon to provide social 
protection of victims, diminished attention given to the latter 
on the part of local authorities and the world community. 
  In assessing the prospects for overcoming the 
sociopsychological sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl 
AES, we must state that: 1) the sources of radiation hazard have 
not disappeared and their impact will probably last for tens of 
years; new victims of the disaster have also been found who were 
previously convinced that they were not involved in its 
consequences; 2) it is impossible to provide all victims with 
normal living conditions, good medical care, work in their 
special field, to compensate them for the material damage; 3) 
social tension persists in society due to the ``unfair'' 
distribution of benefits, humanitarian aid, etc.; 4) victims do 
not trust the authorities, mass media, scientists and 
specialists; 5) it was found that the victims have extremely 
limited opportunities to solve their problems; nor is there any 
effective State sociopsychological and legal aid for these 
people. 
  The reason for the existing situation is not only that the 
necessary funds and resources are wanting, but also there is a 
shortage of constructive ideas to be systematically implement, 
or a scientifically validated conception for eradication of the 
sociopsychological consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl 
AES. 
  In this respect, the only exception is the concept of 
providing for proper mental development of children and 
adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, which was 
developed at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute and 
approved by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. However, it 
requires further definition, since there are still not enough 
scientific data for accurate assessment of the 
sociopsychological and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the 
Chernobyl disaster and prediction of further development of the 
situation. 
  The information we have to date is fragmentary, and for this 
reason it is dangerous to draw far-reaching conclusions on its 
basis. Only one thing is apparent: we can make a distinction of 
at least nine subgroups among affected children, which differ in 
number, relocation, proportion of radioecological and 
psychotraumatic factors, and how the stress situation is 
experienced. They are: --1) those evacuated from the 30-km 
accident zone in 1986; --2) those living or who have lived in 
the zone of mandatory relocation; --3) those referred to the 
guaranteed relocation zone; --4) those living in regions of 
continuous radiometric monitoring; --5) those living on "safety 
islands," situated in the accident zone (Kiev, Slavugich and 
others), who do not, however, agree with this assessment of the 
situation, as well as: --6) children of "eradicators," who were 
born after their parents had fulfilled their civic duty; --7) 
"grandchildren of Chernobyl," i.e., children of the grown 
representatives of the above subgroups; --8) children and 
adolescents in "clean" territories, who were exposed to the risk 
of internal irradiation due to consumption of contaminated food; 
--9) children born in 1986 who were the most affected by the 
radiation factor. 
  A considerable number of children and adolescents of the 
Chernobyl zone were given the status of victims and have the 
right to expect the State's aid; the rest who have, so to speak, 
fallen through the cracks, have not undergone humanitarian 
socio-psychological expert evaluation. The reason is clear: not 
a single decision or enforceable enactment underwent expert 
humanitarian sociopsychological evaluation. 
  The program of further scientific and clinical work in 
1992-1995 aimed at eradicating the socio-psychological 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster covers the following: 
--organization of monitoring of the sociopsychological 
situation, mental development of a representative sample of 
children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, 
starting a distributed data bank in order to assess the 
situation and predict its future dynamics; --expert humanitarian 
evaluation of decisions pertaining to provision of appropriate 
living conditions for children and adolescents affected by the 
consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES, organization 
of the educational-rearing process in and beyond the area where 
they reside; --development, experimental trial and adoption of 
psychological-pedagogic recommendations to workers in public 
education and health care institutions, and parents of affected 
children; --establishment of an infrastructure of specialized 
institutions for socio-psychological rehabilitation of affected 
children and adolescents, provision of psychological 
consultations for them; --training and advanced training of 
personnel (clinical psychologists, pedagogues and social 
workers), providing them with scientific-methodological and 
psychological aid. 
  These tasks have been fulfilled to varying extents. In 1992, 
Kiev State University handed out diplomas of clinical 
psychologists to 140 people who were referred there from the 5 
most affected oblasts of the Ukraine. They returned to their 
homes to work with children in public education institutions and 
specialized psychorehabilitation offices, the network of which 
is already beginning to proliferate. In the future, it is 
planned to graduate 60 clinical psychologists annually from the 
specialized department of Kiev State University, who will be 
involved in implementation of the Children of Chernobyl program. 
  An agreement has been reached to organize training of 
psychologists from affected regions of the Ukraine at Fordham 
University in New York and the New Hope Guild Center also 
located there, which specializes in sociopsychological 
adaptation of migrants. 
  A program for organizing a network of regional 
psychorehabilitation centers in the Ukraine, a decree on 
regional centers and prototype plan to outfit them have been 
developed. 
  Methodological recommendations have been elaborated for: 
parents of affected children (M. I. Alekseyeva), preschool 
institutions for children from the zone of radioactive 
contamination (S. Ye. Kulachkovskaya), different types of 
schools situated in different zones of the Chernobyl disaster 
(I. L. Fedorishina, Yu. M. Shvalb and others), non-educational 
institutions called upon to provide conditions for creative 
development of children and adolescents living in radiation 
zones and unable to spend their free time in the usual way (V. 
V. Rybalka), as well as workers in health camps and rest homes 
where children of the Chernobyl zone spend long periods of time 
(M. I. Borishevskiy, I. M. Turchaninova). 
  Much work has been done in the field of methodological and 
software-hardware support of monitoring the sociopsychological 
situation, mental development of children affected by the 
sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster, and managing a distributed 
data bank (A. M. Karpukhina, V. G. Panok). 
  In 1993, the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute is 
joining in a comprehensive investigation of the adult population 
affected by the sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant.

  [Text] Is radioactive contamination dangerous to the health 
and life of Russia's population? Many, primarily in high 
management spheres, maintain that there is no reason to worry, 
that there are more important things. People living in 
contaminated regions and some scientists think otherwise since 
it has been discovered that low doses may probably be just as 
lethal as the high ones. 
  But more about this later, and in the meantime, we should 
reiterate that in the West, 0.1 rad per year is regarded as the 
safe limit for human health over a 70-year life span. This is 
close to the natural background of 10-20 æR/h. From the many 
units of measurements designating doses, we shall select the rad 
and the Curie. One rad is 100 erg of absorbed radiation per 1 g 
of substance. One Curie (Ci) is 
3.7[.sup].[/]10[.sup]10[/]decays of element nuclei per 
second: this is produced by 1 g of radium. 
Where Are We? 
  Demographic and medical statistics demonstrate that our 
genetic stock is in trouble. We have knocked out the fittest 
among us and spared the remaining ones. The weakened ones bred 
the sick ones. Today, we can hardly find 10% of perfectly 
healthy among the non-old. The population has been reproduced in 
an historically unprecedented fluctuating mode. The October 
[Revolution] engendered four catastrophic decreases in birth 
rates. The first one is still continuing, and since 1991, it has 
become deeper than the third decline, worse than the worst years 
of the last war. 
  The most poisoned country in the world, Russia is 
contaminating the biosphere with chemicals and radiation more 
than others. 
  Approximately 100 billion Ci of radioactive poison has been 
accumulated in the world and approximately half of this is ours. 
Some of it we discharged into the sea--twice as much as the rest 
of the world. Part of it we poured into the reservoirs. No one 
except us dares to store radiation in an open form. In the 
Urals' Lake Karachay alone, 120 MCi has been accumulated. Are we 
waiting for a stronger wind? In Chelyabinsk-40 (Kyshtym), 
storage practices were more reliable, employing steel vessels, 
yet even there something blew up in 1957 and released 20 MCi. It 
killed 20 km[.sup]2[/] of pine forest at once, and forests 
over 700 km[.sup]2[/] became sick. 
  Tomsk-7 ``excelled'' last spring. Then, a cry of despair was 
heard in July from the underground nuclear city in 
Krasnoyarsk-26: ``It may blow up with such a force that 
Chernobyl will look like a picnic!..'' 
  Burying radioactivity is a tricky business. The Americans 
are 
spending billions of dollars to build storage facilities, yet 
even there the scientists warned the U.S. President that the 
science was still not ready to guarantee the reliability of 
burial sites. 
  There is a debate in the West on whether mankind will 
survive 
until 2030. If it will not, who do you think will trigger the 
end? 
On Science and Applications 
  Let us look at the report from the ``UN Scientific Committee 
on the Effect of Atomic Radiation'' which incorporated data for 
1945-1984 (``Radiation: Doses, Effects, Risk.'' Moscow, 1990). 
  Virtually nothing is known about the effect of low radiation 
doses while available information is based either on linear 
extrapolation of large doses or the outcome of experiments on 
animals. Existing recording methods detect only significant 
disorders in the organism while small anomalies remain 
undetected although there are more of them, and their total 
contribution to the impairment of the organisms' functions may 
be even greater. 
Even proof is already available. 
  Nuclear power plant personnel irradiation and radon sources 
within the doses acceptable for operating personnel (5 rad/year) 
increase the number of chromosomal mutations. Little is known 
about the joint effect of radiation and chemical substances 
except perhaps tobacco smoke. The risk for a non-smoking uranium 
mine worker receiving a close-to-maximum permissible irradiation 
dose can be compared to the risk of a non-irradiated smoking 
worker. Yet the joint effect of smoking and irradiation does not 
double but quadruples mortality. In 1970, medical X-ray 
examinations in the United States took more lives than household 
injuries, fires, and poisonings together. 
  It seems like there is a bit more clarity with higher doses. 
A 300-500 rad dose results in a bone marrow injury, and half of 
the irradiated persons die. At 50-100 rad, some cells lose their 
ability to function normally but still regenerate. At 10 rad, 
temporary sterility is observed in men. The probability of dying 
from cancer under 100 rad increases by only 0.1-0.5%, 
while the 
number of serious genetic impairments in the sex cell ranges 
from zero to unity (it is higher among men). The probability 
that a disfigured child may be born to irradiated parents is 
low--0.2% per 100 rad. 
  Yet more recent studies show that cancer and genetic 
impairments appear even at doses which are one-to-two orders of 
magnitude lower than those according to the UN Scientific 
Committee data (Science No. 5002, 1991 and New 
Scientist No. 1871, 1993). 
What Has Chernobyl Shown? 
  Here are some data from the expert conclusion drawn by the 
"International Commonwealth on Restoring the Habitat and Safe 
Human Living Conditions" (Chernobylskaya Katastrofa (Chernobyl 
Catastrophe): Causes and Consequences, Minsk, 1992). In Belarus, 
thyroid gland cancer increased by sevenfold and cardiovascular 
diseases rose by 3.5-fold. In many regions of Gomel and Mogilov 
oblasts, chromosomal mutations increased by 1.5-2 times, the 
frequency of miscarriage and congenital diseases doubled, low 
birth weight jumped by fivefold, and ischemic heart disease 
increased by ninefold. Most schoolchildren have cardiovascular 
system disorders, and one-third of the population in these 
regions hase a weakened immune system. 
  Infant mortality and general population morbidity are 
continuing to rise, the intake of radionuclides into plants is 
not decreasing, and the physiological conditions of the animals 
are deteriorating despite the predictions of scientists from 
Biofizika and despite the measures taken in the aftermath of the 
accident. Social tensions are on the rise. Between 57 and 
90% 
of the respondents stated their categoric desire to relocate. 
The ratio of C-graders to A-graders in schools has increased by 
tenfold. The relocated persons are often met with hostility, as 
if they were lepers, and they run back to their contaminated 
places only to find new owners--refugees from the "near abroad." 
We still have a long way to go to match the Philippines or 
Indonesia where 80% of the population regard themselves as 
happy. 
  One cannot ascertain any pattern in the chaos of data. The 
favorite trick--to compare the polluted region to a clean 
one--does not work since contaminated food, water, and dust in 
the air know no boundaries. Cows in slightly contaminated 
territories (7 Ci/km[.sup]2[/] or approximately 7 rad per 
lifetime) give milk containing 20 times the maximum permissible 
concentration (PDK) of radionuclides. These territories are home 
to approximately 1 million persons. Given a 40 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/] contamination, milk contains 100 times the 
norm, yet shipments under state contracts continue from these 
territories. Drink our milk, my dear, and eat our beef... 
  According to some estimates based on Japanese analyses, the 
marginal cancer mortality due to Chernobyl will reach 70,000 
persons (A. Lyutsko). The Belarussians estimate the loss from 
the catastrophe as 60 annual budgets or 200 billion rubles. A 
modest accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 
the United States cost 135 billion dollars. Chernobyl has 
confronted the Belarussians with the problem of preserving their 
genetic stock. 
  At the same time, an amazing conclusion was drawn by the 
International Project on Chernobyl convened under the aegis of 
IAEA: there is no serious danger, so be fruitful and multiply. 
The IAEA press release is even more surprising: 100 experts from 
this agency admitted in an unofficial forum that there is no 
sufficient reason for their optimism. How shall we interpret 
this, gentlemen? What, indeed, are the reasons if the experts 
have predicted during the early weeks after the catastrophe that 
there would be water contamination, nuclide transport by winds, 
``hot'' dust particles (leading to tuberculosis), nuclide 
migration and presence in the soil, and joint effect of 
radiation and chemicals while forgetting about the immune system 
and genetic apparatus? 
  The IAEA has also approved the WHO concept of concentrating 
the efforts in individual population groups without spending 
them for wide-ranging, long-term research. What is this--penny 
pinching? Incompetence? Or maybe they are being overcome by 
curiosity? Were they finally given a unique opportunity--the 
whole country turned into a nuclear test site? In other words, 
let there be business as usual, and we will keep on looking... 
From Recording to Science 
  It soon will be 100 years since man has been irradiated with 
X-rays and radium and their effect studied. No unambiguous 
conclusions have been drawn thus far. The problem turned out to 
be a tough one. It is difficult to discern patterns among 
thousands of processes in the organism. What we have are 
recording of events, practical habits, and consequences. Yet 
there is no science, and no laws have been established. The 
emerging sciences of radiobiology and radioecology have not had 
the time to mature and bear fruit. 
  Western scientists are cautious: since we know little, let's 
stay close to the natural background of 7 rad per lifetime; the 
British prefer 3.5 rad while the ``British National Committee on 
Radiation Protection'' insists on 2 rad. 
  We do not like such standards. If these were in effect, we 
would be forced to relocate unknown dozens of millions of 
people. We have to choose another path: to raise the safe 
irradiation level. It will be worry-free, and all three branches 
of government will be happy. For us, the Biofizika Institute at 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Public Health has developed a 
standard of 35 rad per lifetime. Yet the foreigners are still 
praising us: yes, yes, they say. It is possible for you since 
you are ahead of the entire planet... Ahead. And running to get 
even further ahead. Give us our 100 rad per lifetime today (yes, 
there is such a proposal). Since the dogs are not dying, it will 
be fine for us too... 
What's Science up to? 
  The new science of radiobiology has recently stumbled across 
the central issue--the effect of low chronic radiation doses on 
the living organism, population, and the biosphere. Chronic 
irradiation may force the humans to depart from the biological 
arena or will generate a new breed of people--morons. Only 
active measures resting on fundamental knowledge have the power 
to resist this. The time when nature covered up for man's 
follies has passed, and today, he himself must save it. 
  Basic research began in the 1960s after the role of DNA 
became clear. Radiobiological studies proceeded according to the 
notion that small exposures resulted in small responses. Yet 
several years ago, Professors Ye. Burlakova and D. Spitkovskiy 
and Doctor of Biological Sciences L. Rozhdestvenskiy discovered 
some unexplained facts. It turned out that a 1-5 rad dose may be 
just as dangerous as 100 rad and even more dangerous than 10-30 
rad. These phenomena were identified in DNA and cell membrane 
lipids by Burlakova and in leukocyte chromosomes by Spitkovskiy. 
Changes occur in the bone marrow trunk cells which produce the 
blood and immune system components under the effect of low doses 
which either increase or decrease the cell's sensitivity to the 
damaging effect of large doses (Rozhdestvenskiy). 
  The earlier-observed effects of low doses clouded by the 
dogma of their low significance have not caused alarm. The 
discovery of the nonlinear character of the radiation's effect 
on living entities demolished this dogma and are in the phase of 
modern scientific paradigm of the behavior of self-organizing 
systems, such as living organisms. Yet the new observations also 
contradict traditional physics and chemistry. One rad is 
3[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-9[/] M/l, or 
2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]15[/] corrosive molecule fragments 
which rain upon the complex and fine mechanism of cell and 
intercellular processes. One rad is the small 
fluctuation which, near the critical state, may lead to a 
catastrophe--the breakup of the organism. One rad is 20 annual 
backgrounds. Yet in addition to radiation, there are pesticides, 
acid rain, heavy metals, and ultraviolet irradiation through the 
ozone holes... And all this is compounded and often multiplied. 
  This means that the problem must be examined and developed 
and research must be expanded. And this needs money. 
  The Chairman of the Scientific Council on Radiobiology at 
Russia's Academy of Sciences Yelena Borisovna Burlakova and 
Professor N.N. Semenova, chief of the Chemical-Physical 
Institute Department at Russia's Academy of Sciences visited the 
Vice President of Russia's Academy of Sciences and Deputy 
Minister for Science (who, by the way, is a corresponding member 
of Russia's Academy of Sciences and an expert in this field) at 
the Environmental Protection and National Resources Ministry and 
at the State Chernobyl Committee. 
  The professors were received splendidly everywhere they 
went, 
and the results of her and her colleagues' studies were praised 
highly, and deep understanding of the importance of the problem 
was expressed, after which they were footballed to the next 
department due to the shortage of funds... When the State 
Chernobyl Committee sent her back to the Academy of Sciences, 
the circle became closed. You guessed it right: no one gave her 
the money. 
Where to Get Money? 
  The Soviet man is accustomed to ``receiving'' money from the 
bureaucrat. A good Soviet bureaucrat knew perfectly well to whom 
``to give'' and for what. If a Politburo member had a pain in 
the eye all of a sudden, three laboratories were set up 
immediately. If the member was satisfied, the bureaucrat's 
bosses were happy and the bureaucrat was happy too. If the 
member died, all three laboratories were fired. And everybody 
was again unhappy. 
  And what is the advantage or satisfaction from radiobiology? 
Is there danger or threat to health without it? 
  Well, it is not quite like that. We do have a special 
agriculture industry, special food and water purified in order 
to remove from any kind of poison, and special environmental 
condition monitoring. We also have special children who will 
grow up, and we will make sure that they, in turn, do not give 
birth to monsters, and should the worst happen, we will park 
them abroad... 
  The biologists are asking for money to save academic 
radiobiology. In translation, this means to save us and our 
children, not the chosen ones. Yet they have to ask it from the 
same bureaucrat and oftentimes, from the same person. And 
naturally, with the same outcome. 
  The conclusion is self-evident.

  [Text] (Main theses were presented and distributed 
04-09-93 at a meeting of the Interbranch Commission on Problems 
of Continuing Operation of the ChAES [Chernobyl AES]; the 
Commission had been organized on assignment of the Cabinet of 
Ukraine No. 15083/64 of 11-16-92). 
  The ChAES administration substantiates the possibility and 
feasibility of continuing the operation of the ChAES based 
mainly on the following three factors: 
  1 - Economic inexpediency of decommissioning the ChAES 
  2 - A sufficient safety level 
  3 - The human factor. 
  Therefore one must evaluate all pro and contra factors 
within 
the context of these three categories. 
  I. Economic Considerations. 
  In regards to economic arguments for continuing the 
operation 
of ChAES one should note that when providing economic 
justification of continuing the operation the principle aspect 
is determining potential economic losses caused by possible 
heavy accidents at the ChAES. 
  Taking into account the current economic conditions, 
liquidation of potential accident effects of an even 
substantially lower scale compared to the 1986 accident will 
result in disproportionately large direct economic losses. Under 
these circumstances it is hard even to estimate the blow to the 
national economy. 
  It is worth noting that the absence of established in 
advance 
criteria of economic, organizational and technological 
acceptability and the risk of continuing the ChAES operation, 
which would provide an appropriate gauge for a skilled analysis 
of the factors under consideration, does not make possible an 
unambiguous assessment of continuing the ChAES operation. 
  II. Safety Level 
  The ChAEs administration justifies sufficiency of the safety 
level mainly by the large number of safety improving measures 
taken after 1986. But in doing so the basic deficiencies of RBMK 
[the type of ChAES reactors] have not been eliminated, namely: 
  - the absence of a localization system for the 
upper (steam-water) section of reactor pipelines; as a result, 
in the case of a certain accident (rupture of the PVK [expansion 
not given], separator drum and/or steam lines to the GZZ 
[expansion not given]) an indeterminate amount of radioactive 
heat- transfer agent can be released into the environment. In 
addition, such accident leads to a loss of the heat-transfer 
agent and can result in dewatering the fuel core with all 
accompanying consequences; 
  the reactor vulnerability to ruptures of 
technological channels (according to calculations performed by 
the Chief Designer the localization system was designed for 
rupture of not more than two to three channels, and independent 
experts surmise the possibility of the mechanism of a chain-like 
increase of the number of TK [expansion not given] ruptures 
after a rupture of one channel); such accident is analogous to 
the 1986 accident; 
  vulnerability of the steel-zirconium joints in 
technological channels to temperature fluctuations and their 
uncertain behavior in the case of thermal shocks (for instance, 
a false or prearranged operation of the SAOR [expansion not 
given] system); 
  low quality and reliability of the equipment, 
especially of shutoff and control valves and the ``SKALA'' 
computing control system (the service life of the latter had 
been used up long ago); 
  - the absence of protection of safety-important 
equipment from negative environmental factors (temperature, 
humidity and impact loads), which makes this equipment 
vulnerable in accident situations; 
  - the absence of physical separation of power 
supply cables for standby equipment of safety and 
safety-important systems and separation of power and control 
cable flows; 
  - inefficiency of the generator room fire-fighting 
system and vulnerability of design solutions related to 
placement of safety-important systems in the generator room; 
  a large number if welded joints in the first loop 
(KMPTs [expansion not given]) and the absence of 
state-of-the-art diagnostic systems. 
  In addition, the insufficient current safety level is 
substantially affected by the following factors: 
  unsatisfactory level of the safety culture, which 
is indicated by a large number of additional failures and 
defects detected during scheduled simulated accident situations; 
  miscalculations of the existing system of 
providing corrective actions based on results of investigation 
of incidents and accident situations; this was noted by the IAEA 
expert ASSET mission based on results of investigating the 
circumstances of the 1991 fire of the second unit. 
  As far as the measures aimed at improving neutron-physical 
parameters of RBMK that were implemented in operating ChAES 
units are concerned, one should also note the presence of 
essentially negative consequences of modernization of the 
control and protection system (CPS), the most serious of which 
are: 
  increased positive effect of dewatering of the 
CPS coolant circuit, which under certain situations of 
compensation with rods during reaching a critical state (the 
most vulnerable moment) can get as high as 5-6 eff; and it 
should be noted that this positive reactivity is released when 
draining water just within approximately two meters of the 
middle section of the fuel core (which is indicated by results 
of 1987 physical experiments in the third unit); 
  when operating at nominal capacity the 
operational reactivity margin is mostly comprised of rods 
submerged into the core, so the actual operating reactivity 
margin is much lower than computed by ``SKALA'' (43-48 RR 
[expansion not given]); the remaining rods are mainly located in 
the VK [expansion not given] (except local automatic 
regulators). These factors are playing the principle role in 
reducing AZ-5 [expansion not given] effectiveness during the 
first second of its operation: 
  - reduced subcriticality margin of the reactor 
when stopping it and impossibility of repair modes without 
introducing additional absorbers into the core. 
  Concentrating one's attention on using up the 
channel-graphite clearance as the main and only factor that 
determines the possibility or impossibility of continuing 
operation of RBMK is artificial. The RBMK has a lot of other 
drawbacks, and a large number of those have not yet been 
detected and analyzed. The most significant is the regularity 
and sequence of dangerous RBMK accidents after 1986 (the most 
striking examples are an LAES [Leningrad AES] accident in March 
of 1992 and a complicated fire in the generator room of the 
second unit in October of 1991). 
  Thus, the problem of increasing the safety level after the 
modernizations leaves open the main problem: is the current RBMK 
safety level acceptable? From the standpoint of requirements of 
international safety rules and even the former Soviet Union 
rules the safety level of this type of reactors is unacceptable. 
  - III. Human Factor 
  From the standpoint of social factors and the problem of 
employment of highly skilled personnel, continuing the operation 
to 1997 will not eliminate the problem in principle - it will 
only postpone it for some time. 
  Under these conditions and taking into account predominant 
safety considerations when considering the problem of stopping 
the CHAES operation, one should consider the availability of a 
large number of skilled personnel within a different context, 
namely, as a positive factor which can solve the problem of 
manning new units of AES with VVER-1000 [reactor type] if a 
substantiated decision is made to stop the moratorium on their 
commissioning. 
  Based on the above arguments, Minpryrody considers the 
substantiation of the possibility of continuing the operation of 
the Chernobyl AES insufficient and the Supreme Soviet decision 
regarding decommissioning of the Chernobyl AES inexpedient. 
  ``UKRAYINSKA GAZETA''. By publishing a selection of 
documents related to continuing operation of the Chernobyl AES 
we are hoping to inform our readers about the Acting Prime 
Minister's response as to the position of both sides, as well as 
to receive a clear Minpryrody answer as to what to do with our 
AES and how to do it.

  [Abstract] The search for new sources of electric power 
prompted an attempt to consider the power of the ocean--the 
principal store of energy on the planet--from the viewpoint of 
general electromechanics. The approach to developing commercial 
power plants for generating large quantities of electric power 
necessitated an examination (qualitative, at first) of the ocean 
power from the viewpoint of electromechanical energy conversion. 
To this end, the planet Earth is considered as an electrical 
machine whose magnetic field is created by a longitudinal 
current on the boundary of the solid core and liquid magma as 
well as radiation belts in space. The design of a unipolar 
electric motor is cited, and the planet Earth-electric machine 
is simulated by a machine which combines a magnetohydrodynamic 
(MGD) generator with an MHD motor in a single electromechanical 
system. It is assumed that the Earth rests on space just like 
electric machines working in parallel with a network of infinite 
power in engineering electromechanics. The sine-shaped curve of 
transverse current on the planar Earth projection is plotted, 
and it is noted that the sinusoidal curve coincides with the 
great oceanic currents, i.e., the Gulfstream and the Great 
Pacific Current. The effect of retardation of the Earth's 
spinning speed is taken into account. The high probability of a 
global change in the geomagnetic field and its consequences call 
for setting up state programs aimed at addressing the resulting 
global issues. The conclusion is drawn that electromechanical 
energy conversion has a certain role to play in our planet's 
evolution and that electromechanical energy's fraction of the 
total energy balance of the planet is on the same order of 
magnitude as thermal energy. Figures 4; references 9.

  [Abstract] The widening gap between the physical and 
engineering base of the construction industry and today's 
standards, the low mechanization level of roofing operations, 
and the increasing popularity of soft bitumen-based materials 
prompted the National Scientific Research Institute of Polymer 
Building Materials together with the Tekhnopom National 
Scientific and Engineering Center to examine the effectiveness 
of shaped cutting of rolled bitumen-impregnated roofing 
materials using a specialized laser system. To this end, CW, 
pulse, and periodic pulse CO[.sup]2[/], garnet, ruby, and 
Nd-glass lasers are tested. The experiment demonstrates that 
CO[.sup]2[/] CW lasers with a 1-6 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/] air 
injection to the cutting zone are optimum for materials moving 
at a high velocity relative to the beam. A comparison of laser, 
mechanical, and combined laser-mechanical cutting methods and 
process parameters makes it possible to speculate that a 36.9 
m/min cutting speed can be obtained using a 5 kW laser whose 
radiation is split into two beams. The advantages of a 
computer-aided laser cutting system include the simplicity and 
speed of switching from one standard size of material to 
another. The findings confirm the outlook for using laser 
radiation for shaped cutting of soft bitumen-impregnated roofing 
materials and the method's ability to implement complex designer 
concepts and original shapes for various building roof shapes. 
The anticipated economic impact from implementing the 
computer-aided laser complex using the combined laser-mechanical 
method with a double-split beam and three knives is up to 10 
million rubles in 1993 prices. References 4.

  [Abstract] Preliminary results of measurement of the total 
content and altitude concentration distribution of ozone are 
presented. Measurements were made from the Meteor-3 satellite 
with a BUFS-2 ultraviolet spectrometer. The information 
processing method is outlined, and simultaneous results obtained 
from the US TOMS ozone meter on the Meteor-3 are presented. The 
BUFS-2 instrument is a diffraction spectrometer with double 
monochromatization (dispersion subtraction) of the incident 
radiation. There are twelve spectral channels in the 255-340 nm 
range, with one channel at 388 nm in continuous operation. 
Ratios of atmospheric albedo are measured at a pair of 
wavelengths and compared with previously calculated values of 
these ratios for various ozone content figures. A figure 
contrasts ozone content findings from the BUFS-2 and the TOMS 
instruments for various latitudes. The Antarctic ozone hole is 
evident. Figures give the ozone concentration altitude 
distribution for Antarctica, the tropics, the middle latitudes, 
and the small ozone hole at 38.9N 111.5W formed by intrusion of 
a tropical air mass at the middle latitudes. Experimental data 
are contrasted with model data. The derivation of the model is 
described. Figures 3; table 1; references 16: 9 Russian, 7

  [Abstract] The model used in this study covers altitudes 
from 0 to 60 km and considers chemical and photochemical 
processes involving O, H, C, N, and Cl. The temperature and 
density used in the model are representative of March at 
45ëN. The model is one-dimensional and yields global average 
daily vertical profiles of atmospheric components. There is a 
satisfactory agreement between the theoretical models and 
observational data in most cases; however, there are substantial 
divergences in the concentrations of several components at 
various altitudes. For example, the models used here yielded 
excessive amounts of NHO[.sup]3[/], much less 
H[.sup]2[/]O, and at higher altitudes, noticeably less 
CH[.sup]4[/] and H[.sub]2[/]. This may be due to problems 
with the chemical scheme of the model due to a poor description 
of vertical transfer, as well as incorrect treatment of 
turbulent mixing. Further study is required to identify physical 
and chemical processes responsible for these divergences. Models 
and observational data can be more accurately compared by using 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. Individuals 
ections of the article discuss active and inert components, 
HNO[.sup]3[/] and O[.sub]3[/]. Figures 22; references 8: 2

  [Abstract] A study was made to determine the minimum energy 
of a space body impacting on the Earth's surface with which the 
developing cloud breaks through the tropopause and enters the 
upper atmosphere. The possible consequences of impacts of bodies 
with a diameter from 100 m to 1 km is examined; the altitude of 
rising of the cloud is estimated for an impact with an energy 
10-30 megatons. The physical picture of the resulting effects is 
discussed in detail. With the impact of meteor bodies with an 
energy in the indicated range a break is formed in the 
tropopause and dust surges into the upper layers of the 
atmosphere. With an increase in the mass of the impacting body, 
and accordingly, an increase in the energy of the explosion by 
two or three orders of magnitude, there is a change in the very 
character of rising of the dust cloud because instead of a 
turbulent cloud rising relatively slowly under the influence of 
Archimedes force a high-velocity plasma of the space body and 
ground (with the mass of the latter being greater than that of 
the space body itself) escapes into the upper layers of the 
atmosphere. The atmospheric dust content will be determined to a 
considerable degree by condensation processes. Only in the late 
stages will there be a slower ejection of melt and finely 
dispersed dust to lesser altitudes, but nevertheless above the 
tropopause. Additional atmospheric pollution will occur due to 
the great fires arising under the influence of thermal 
radiation. Figures 4; references 15: 1 Russian, 14 Western.

  [Abstract] Results obtained from the use of passive radar 
to study the physics of clouds and the diffusion of passive 
components in the lower part of the boundary layer of atmosphere 
are the foundation for the use of carbon and graphite chaff to 
track planned and accidental emissions of harmful substances by 
industry. The cloud of harmful substances is marked with chaff 
with a rate of sedimentation closely matching that of the 
tracked substance. Several materials with different rates of 
sedimentation may be used to track various components of the 
cloud.. The chaff is to be installed in the stacks, ventilators, 
and other structural elements of the plant and may be released 
on command or automatically when the maximum permissible 
concentration of a substance is exceeded in the emission. 
Figures show how this method was used to track the vertical and 
horizontal position and configuration of a cloud of chaff. A 
similar experiment conducted in the US with aluminized mylar 
chaff is noted. The maximum tracking distance for various 
diffusion conditions is determined. Figures 3; table 1; 
references 21: 16 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] This article discusses the intermediate 
climatic effects of atomic power plants on the environment. The 
plant used as an example is the Leningrad atomic power plant, 
which has a boiling-water uranium-graphite reactor. The two main 
factors affecting the environment are the release of radioactive 
materials from the stack, and the release of hot water into a 
natural body of water (in this case a section of the Gulf of 
Finland). The classification of accidents in the Russian system 
and the IAEA is contrasted. The Russian system has two levels of 
accident: one which can be handled automatically by the plant 
(which the plant is designed for), and the other is a 
catastrophic accident. The accident of the Leningrad plant on 24 
March 1992 is used as an example. The table presents maximum 
permissible concentrations of emissions for a stack height of 
100 m. The figure gives dosage versus distance data for fallout 
of iodine from a radioactive cloud. A formula is presented to 
calculate possible ground level concentrations of contaminants.

  [Abstract] Metals are released by virtually all of 
Chimkent's industries: cementmaking, refining, phosphorus 
processing, asbestos cement construction, thermal electric power 
generation, etc. The situation is worsened by the city's 
tendency to develop inversion layers, coupled with low winds and 
low precipitation levels. The distribution of metals in the 
lower atmosphere over Chimkent was studied by analyzing the 
quantity and spatial differentiation of pollution, the daily 
pattern and dynamics of concentrations of toxins in relation to 
synoptic-meteorological conditions, and by identifying the 
sources of pollution. The experimental method of the study is 
described. Lead was found to be the most hazardous pollutant, 
with concentrations reaching 25-50 times the maximum permissible 
concentration during some periods. The lead smelting plant and 
the coal burning thermal electric plant were found to be key 
sources of pollutants. Figure 1; table 1; references 6 (Russian).

``Machines for Plant Protection''] 
  [Text] The Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association is a 
supplier of boom and blower sprayers (except for a small 
quantity of OPV-1200A sprayers transferred to the 
Tadzhikkhimselkhozmash Plant for production), fertilizer 
distributors and machines for disinfecting livestock buildings. 
Most articles are produced as unified families out of basic 
models and units employing a modular unit layout. However, 
designers are devoting increasingly greater attention to making 
machines all-purpose by using various interchangeable tools for 
surface and soil application, spray rods with hose reels, and so 
on, and showing concern for improving the health and hygienic 
conditions of the work of machine operators. 
  Creation of machines making it possible to raise 
productivity 
by increasing operating width and speed, and using devices 
capable of reducing working fluid consumption rates appears 
promising. The equipment will become less material- and 
energy-intensive, and it will be fitted out with automated 
systems based on electronics and microprocessor technology. 
  In 1991 the Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association 
produced 26,500 sprayers and fertilizer distributors; however, 
this amount turned out to be insufficient to completely satisfy 
the demand for equipment. In most cases rural laborers failed to 
receive enough of the machinery they needed because of 
shortfalls in deliveries of a number of associated parts and 
materials, and owing to an ill-conceived pricing policy. 
  Information exchange among CIS countries has weakened 
unfortunately. Sometimes farmers are unaware of what kind of 
equipment is being produced, where it could be ordered and how 
much it costs. Readers will be interested in our report on 
machines in series production at plants of this production 
association. 
  The plant can offer the following machines today: 
  OP-2000-2 small trailed boom sprayer; 
  OPSh-15 trailed boom sprayer; 
  OM-630-2 small mounted boom sprayer; 
  PZhU-2.5 liquid fertilizer distributor; 
  PZhU-5 liquid fertilizer distributor; 
  PZhU-9 liquid fertilizer distributor; 
  MDPF-2000 trailed disinfector; 
  OPV-2000 trailed blower sprayer; 
  POM-630 and POM-630-1 mounted fertilizer 
distributor-sprayer; 
  OP-32000 fertilizer distributor; 
  OP-32000-1 fertilizer distributor-sprayer. 
  A diversity of standard tank sizes permits sensible use of 
equipment in all conditions: in zones with small field maps and 
a pass length of up to 1 km (630 and 1,200 liter tanks); with 
midsized field maps and a pass length of up to 2 km (2,000 liter 
tank); in zones with large field maps and a pass length of up to 
3 km (3,200 liter tank); with large field maps and a pass length 
greater that 3 km; in farms with fields located far away from 
the central farmstead (6,400 liter tank). 
  Rural laborers, including commercial farmers, will be 
interested in a new family of boom-type machines for plant 
protection and for application of liquid mineral fertilizers. 
The MZU-320 and MZU-320-1 mounted machines and the MZU-1200 
trailed machine will be an aid in protecting field row and 
vegetable crops with liquid chemical or microbiological 
preparations, and they will provide for surface application of 
basic solutions of complete liquid fertilizers. They can also be 
used successfully to disinfect livestock buildings and to wash 
agricultural machines with the help of spray rods supplied by 
special order. The machines are outfitted with units for 
mechanized working mixture preparation, and they are equipped 
with a special system for flushing the tank and all lines after 
spraying in order to ensure maximum environmental protection. 
  The MZU-3200 machine for plant protection and 
fertilizer application is intended for chemical protection 
of serial crops cultivated by intensive procedures with a 
constant equipment track width (1,800 mm), and other field crops 
against pests, diseases and weeds under routine and small-volume 
spraying conditions, while its MZU-3200-1 
modification is intended both for surface application of 
pesticides and complete liquid fertilizers (including with 
intensive procedures without a constant equipment track width), 
and for surface application of herbicides and their simultaneous 
placement with soil-working implements, and internal application 
of complete liquid fertilizer simultaneously with presowing soil 
working by cultivators. An attachment for surface application of 
all-purpose herbicides with their simultaneous placement in the 
soil by BMSh-15, BMSh-20 and BIG-3A harrows hitched to SP-16A 
units, used for internal application of complete liquid 
fertilizers, may be added to the MZU-3200-1 machine at the 
client's request. 
  Sprayers are equipped with horizontally stabilized hydraulic 
wide-swath booms, which guarantees high processing quality at an 
operating speed of up to 12 km/hr. The process itself as well as 
folding and raising of the boom are controlled by a hydraulic 
system from the tractor cab. The height of the boom is 
adjustable from 0.7 to 1.8 m. Four standard sizes of slot 
sprayers and two of deflector sprayers make it possible to vary 
consumption of working fluid per hectare within a wide range. 
Attachments are secured by quick-release bayonet joints. A 
closed stream method is used to adjust the machinery for work. 
  Sprayers are outfitted by a separate order with an automatic 
control system (SAURZh) ensuring stable maintenance of a set 
consumption rate with a deviation of 5 percent even with change 
in speed. There is a device for mechanizing preparation of 
working mixtures, and an extra tank (320 liters) for clean water 
used to flush the lines. 
  Specialists of the GSKTB selkhozkhimmash [not further 
identified] are conducting scientific research and experimental 
design work to create machinery for a contact wetting method of 
applying herbicides and plant growth regulators, electrostatic 
sprayers, sprayers employing a pneumatic spray-forming system, 
aerosols with controllable drop size, and machines for separate 
delivery of pesticides and water. Some of the work is being done 
jointly with companies of the FRG. 
  In addition the GSKTB selkhozkhimmash is working on a 
contract basis to prepare equipment for pesticide-conserving 
plant protection procedures that produce a savings of 
preparations of up to 50 percent, and to introduce them into the 
farms of clients; 
  for band placement of herbicides in the cultivation of corn, 
sugar beets and other industrial crops by means of the OPK-8 
sprayer-distributor; 
  for highly productive remote spraying of potatoes against 
the 
Colorado beetle and cereal crops against pests using the OPU-320 
sprayer (with a working fluid consumption rate of 1-20 
liters/ha); 
  for processing potatoes (OPSh-320, OPSh-630) against 
phytophthora using pneumatic booms (with a consumption rate of 
20-100 liters/ha); 
  for treatment of small volumes of potatoes (PSK-20) prior to 
planting and storage (with a working fluid consumption rate of 
3-8 liters/tonne); 
  introduction of a biological plant protection method of 
releasing entomophages by means of RESh-18 boom sprayers, and 
OShU-50 and PRE-35 blower sprayers for releasing 
Trichogramma; 
  sanitary and hygienic processing of livestock buildings 
using 
a cold aerosol generator. 
  The ZR-2000, ZR-3200, ZR-3200-1 and MPR-3200 
mixer-loaders, which are intended for preparation of 
working fluids out of quickly dissolving ingredients and for 
loading sprayers, occupy a special place in the outfit of 
machines for chemical plant protection. They are fitted out with 
a tapered container for storage of concentrated pesticides and a 
system for their metered delivery. The pumping unit of ZR-2000 
and ZR-2000-1 mixers is driven by an internal combustion engine 
(made in the USA) while that of the ZR-3200 is driven by the 
tractor's power takeoff shaft. 
  Lvov designers have developed the OMT-100 small 
sprayer for commercial farms, leasing organizations and 
peasant farms. This device is mounted on a T-010 tractor of the 
Kharkov Tractor Plant and the AZhMK-8 of the Gomselmash Plant, 
and it is intended for chemical protection of orchards, 
vineyards, and vegetable and other crops. It can be used for 
disinfection and disinfestation of buildings, for irrigation of 
small private plots, and in orchard and gardening cooperatives. 
  Comparison of the basic specifications of the new generation 
of sprayers with the best foreign analogues shows that in terms 
of productivity, swath, lifting capacity, working fluid 
consumption rates and other indicators, they correspond to world 
standards. However, designers still have more work to do to 
reduce weight and material content, to upgrade the quality of 
manufacture, and to improve appearance. 
  Designers are also troubled by the problem of raising the 
effectiveness of chemical plant protection measures, which 
depends in many ways on the proficiency of machine operators and 
competent operation of equipment. This is precisely why the 
association has organized a training center at which to upgrade 
the qualifications of machine operators. It has been supplied 
with posters describing the layout, adjustment and control of 
the machines. Specialists will soon be offered illustrated 
manuals offering recommendations on the use, technical 
maintenance, storage, preservation and repair of the machines. 
It is to be published this year. 
  The equipment is being sold both through the Agropromsnab 
[not further identified] and through direct contracts. Those 
wishing to acquire the machines need to sign a contract with the 
Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association or pay for the 
machines in advance.

  [Abstract] A study of the effects of hypobaric hypoxia 
equivalent to an altitude of 9000 m and to sea level on the 
stability of erythrocyte, lysosome, and mitochondrial membranes 
was based on a number of assumptions and previously established 
facts. The researchers had earlier ascertained that hypobaric 
hypoxia destabilizes erythrocyte membranes and results in an 
increase in serum levels of extraerythrocyte hemoglobin, total 
peroxidase activity, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
activity. Such hypoxia also changes the permeability of 
lysosomal membranes and the activity of lysosomal peptide 
hydrolases and disrupts the structures of the mitochondrial 
membrane and the catalytic properties of monoaminooxidase. Since 
the psychotropic drug pirazidol inhibits lipid peroxidation 
rate, the researchers hypothesized that the administration of 
the drug ahead of time would stabilize membranes and help to 
raise the body's resistance to hypoxia. In white male rats 
confined for three hours in an altitude chamber with an 
atmospheric pressure of 0.029 mPa, the administration of the 
pirazidol prevented a rise in the serum levels of hemoglobin, 
total iron, and total peroxidase activity. The overall activity 
of lysosomal acidic peptide hydrolases in all tissues and the 
free activity in the brain and liver did not differ from 
control, and the pulmonary activity of enzymes in soluble 
fraction was even 27 percent lower than in control animals. The 
administration of the drug also prevented any change in 
substrate specificity in mitochondrial fraction, as well as 
enzyme release to soluble fraction. References 28: 20 Russian, 8

  [Abstract] Elucidating the mechanism underlying the 
infection of cells by viruses requires study of the initial 
state of infection, i.e., the interaction of fusion peptide and 
cell surface, during which the functionally important change in 
the ion permeability of the cell membrane may take place. 
Bimolecular lipid membranes with incorporated fusion peptides 
are best suited for such study. The researchers here chose to 
use a synthetic polypeptide that consisted of 23 amino acid 
residues structurally similar to the Lassa arenavirus fusion 
peptide and that induced the fusion of small single-layer 
liposomes in a study of the features of the interaction of that 
peptide and bilayer lipid membranes consisting of dioleoyl 
phosphatidylcholine; they demonstrated the ability of the 
peptide to form single cation-selective channels with varying 
conductance levels. The amplitude histogram of the single 
channels contained four components with average values of 4.5, 
8.2, 10.1, and 12.4 pSi for bilayers in 0.1 M solutions of KCl, 
pH 7.4, at 21ëC and peptide concentrations of 2 x 
10[.sup]-9[/] M. Peak number and position was a function of 
peptide concentration in the aqueous solution, their ion 
composition, pH value, and temperature. The heterogeneity of 
levels of conductance was attributed to the presence of various 
aggregates of fusion peptide molecules. Figures 5, references

  [Abstract] One of the most promising methods of studying 
the interaction of bacterioopsin and the chromophore in 
bacteriorhodopsin involves the use of analogs that are proteins 
obtained via the replacement of retinal with a synthetic analog. 
There are two primary techniques for performing the replacement: 
incubation of the analog with apomembranes and cultivation of 
halobacteria that are defective in terms of retinal synthesis on 
a medium to which a given retinal analog is added. Since 
replacement with the first technique has a negligible effect on 
protein structure and interprotein interactions, and the 
purple-membrane hydroxylaminolysis involved leads to 
irreversible changes in properties, the second technique is 
thought to produce analogs with a protein structure that is 
closer to native and with certain properties that differ from 
those of analogs obtained with the first technique. The 
researchers here studied the structural and functional 
differences between the bacteriorhodopsin 4-keto analog obtained 
via the insertion of a retinal analog into apomembranes 
consisting of either the R1M1 or ET-1000 strains and the pigment 
obtained via the cultivation of the JW-5 mutant retinal-free 
strain on a medium containing 4-keto-retinal. The absorption 
spectrum of the pigment from the JW-5 strain had no 
retinal-oxime absorption band, but did possess a minor band at 
410 nm that, in terms of peak, coincided with the band of 
brown-membrane cytochrome b. The circular dichromism spectrum of 
the pigment lacks the typical pronounced doublet, and one 
positive band predominates, with only small distortions. Opsin 
fluorescence output is twice that in 4-keto-BR, and the spectral 
peak is shifted toward longer wavelengths by 2-3 nm. No 
light-adaptation spectral effects were observed in the pigment 
from the JW-5 strain. The dependence of the constant for the 
intermediate M rates of decay is lg(k) approximately -pH/5 at pH 
5-7, and lg(k) approximately -pH/1.25 at pH 7-9. Figures 2,

  [Abstract] In recent years, increasing attention has been 
devoted to the study of the genetic system of chloroplasts and 
mitochondria as a result of the possibility of the use of intact 
organelles and their genetic elements in experiments involving 
genetic and cell engineering. Particularly noteworthy is the 
analysis of ARS fragments of DNA of cell organelles and plasmids 
as a possible means of engineering potential plant vectors. The 
work reported here represents the first time mitochondrial 
plasmid-like DNA of cotton has ever been identified and 
described. The mitochondrial DNA was isolated from etiolated 
cotton shoots via differential and equilibrium ultracentrifuging 
in a CsCl-Hoechst 33258 density gradient. Electron microscopy 
and electrophoresis in agar gel showed that the mitochondria of 
G. hirsutum L. (108-F) contain, in addition to the 
principal high-molecular-mass DNA, two mini-ring DNA of 6.5 and 
2.4 kbp. The plasmid-like DNA was found to contain no 
appreciable traces of nuclear or plastid DNA. Figures 4,

  [Abstract] The microbicidal effect of macrophages is 
primarily due to the functioning of lysosomes, and many 
researchers consider an elevated lysosome content and 
intensified secretion of lysosomal enzymes signs of macrophage 
activation. The participation of lysosomal enzymes in the 
intracellular killing process depends not only on their 
synthesis, however, but also on processes ensuring their contact 
with absorbed microorganisms, which is to say on the fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes. Evidence exists that fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes does not always guarantee 
intracellular killing. In particular, the reports regarding the 
relationship of the plague microbe Yersinia pestis 
with lysosomes have been contradictory. Consequently, a study 
was conducted to examine the effect of a vaccine strain of 
Yersinia pestis on the fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Nonpedigree 
guinea pigs weighing 250 to 300 g each were immunized either 
subcutaneously or aerogenically with a vaccine strain of 
Yersinia pestis (10 guinea pigs were immunized in 
each case). Peritoneal and alveolar macrophages of the immunized 
animals were studied on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after immunization 
to determine their lysosome content and the fusion of the 
lysosomes with phagosomes. The experiments established that the 
frequency of fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes in the alveolar 
macrophages was only half that in the peritoneal macrophages. 
Subcutaneous immunization stimulated the fusion of lysosomes and 
phagosomes in the peritoneal macrophages but not in the alveolar 
macrophages, whereas aerogenic vaccination stimulated the fusion 
of lysosomes with phagosomes in both types of macrophages. A 
correlation between the macrophages' ability to kill 
Yersinia pestis and the frequency of fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes was established. It was hypothesized 
that during endocytosis of plague microbe in unvaccinated guinea 
pigs, there occurs a suppression of the fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes that is much more pronounced in the case of alveolar 
macrophages than in the case of peritoneal macrophages. Figures 
2; references 12: 5 Russian, 7 Western.

  [Abstract] Cell hybrids containing human chromosomes or 
their fragments against the ``background'' of the hamster or 
mouse genome are among the most popular tools for analyzing the 
human genome. Until now, attempts to create and maintain such 
hybrids have been fraught with a number of problems. A 
fundamentally new technique for detecting human DNA based on a 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with arbitrary primers (referred 
to as the AP-PCR method) has been developed. The new method was 
tested on two previously created hybrid clones representing a 
cross of Chinese hamster (VL79-_g_-8) and the human cell line 
HeLa. The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 15V 
P4 was used as a negative control. Genome DNA that yielded 
well-differentiated PCR patterns when amplified with two 
different arbitrary primers (21 and 45) was isolated from the 
hybrid clones and from the pure cell lines. From the standpoint 
of the appearance of their PCR patterns, the two hybrid clones 
produced with the two different primers were in no way different 
from the starting hamster line. Dot hybridization of the 
amplified DNA of these clones with tagged human amplified DNA 
clearly demonstrated the presence of human DNA, however. The DNA 
of the yeasts amplified with primer 45 yielded the same negative 
result as the hamster DNA. In the human genome DNA (HeLa), 
researchers succeeded in amplifying those unique, strictly 
specific genome sequences that, when used as a tagged probe, 
revealed homologous human DNA in the DNA cell hybrids and thus 
confirmed their hybrid nature. Dot hybridization with the 
amplified hamster DNA used as a probe demonstrated that 
hamster-specific sequences are completely absent in the human 
DNA amplified with the same primer. Similar results were 
obtained for primers 21 and 45. The new AP-PCR, which is said to 
be without analogues, was deemed suitable not only for detecting 
human DNA in interspecific hybrids but also in identifying human 
chromosomes by in situ hybridization or cross dot hybridization 
with monochromosomal human hybrids. The new AP-PCR method was 
said to possess the following distinctive features: 

  -  the selection of primers is unlimited (no knowledge of 
nucleotide sequence is required when constructing primers, and 
paired combinations of primers may be used to make sequencing 
easier; 
  -  one and the same primer may be used to identify the DNA of 
both 
organisms whose genomes constitute a given cell hybrid; 
  -  the result of amplification is always positive (the 
amplifiability of DNA is directly controlled) 
  -  the presence of DNA is judged not by the fact of 
amplification 
but rather by the capability of the amplified DNA under analysis 
to hybridize with human DNA amplified with the very same 
primer. 
  (This study was partially financed with funds provided by 
the 
Human Genome State Scientific-Technical Program [grant No. 
350].) Figures 2; references 26: 6 Russian, 20 Western.

  [Abstract] A set of techniques has been proposed for 
obtaining hybrid cell lines representing a cross between human 
and Chinese hamster cells. Specifically, the technique of 
introducing exogenous genetic material into cells by 
transfecting the cells is proposed as a way of overcoming 
existing problems with genetic markers. The transfected material 
serves to mark various segments of the genome in the different 
cell clones. These portions of the genome may then be preserved 
in cell hybrids by using a selective medium. The human DNA 
preserved in the hybrids may be obtained and tested in two ways: 
1. by karyotyping the hybrid cells by means of continuous 
cytometry (which makes it possible to identify and sort human 
chromosomes as individual peaks on the resultant histogram and 
2. by obtaining large amounts of human DNA from the hybrids by 
a chain polymerase reaction with primers homologous to the 
consensus sequence of Alu-repeats specific for human DNA. 
The experiments conducted to test and illustrate the proposed 
procedure were performed on a subclone of a crossed line of lung 
fibroblasts of Chinese hamster (V79-_g_-8). A culture of human 
embryo lung fibroblasts served as the primary culture. The cells 
were grown in Eagle's medium plus either 20 percent bovine serum 
or 10 percent embryonal calf serum and 5 percent human umbilical 
cord serum. The plasmid psv2neo, which caries a gene of 
resistance to the antibiotic G418, was used to transfect the 
human fibroblasts. The plasmid was introduced into the cells by 
electroporation. The transfected cells were selected in a medium 
containing the antibiotic G418 (500 æg/ml). To obtain the 
cell 
hybrids, the researchers incubated the cell mixture in a 
suspension with phytohemagglutinin (10 æg/ml) for 10 minutes. 
This was followed by centrifugation and processing of the cells 
for 1 minute with 50 percent polyethylene glycol. The hybrid 
cells were selected in a medium with a reduced serum content (7 
percent) in the presence of 500 æg/ml antibiotic. The primer 
Alu-517 was used in the chain polymerase reaction. After the 
polymerase reaction had been completed, aliquots of amplified 
DNA (volume, 2 æl) were separated in 1.8 percent agarose in 
0.75xTAE buffer. Several dozen clones of human embyro lung 
fibroblasts resistant to 500 æg/ml of the antibiotic G418 
were 
obtained. Cells cloned for several months in the absence of G418 
retained their resistance to the antibiotic, thus indicating the 
stable integration of the plasmid into the chromosomal DNA. The 
experiments confirmed that the primer Alu-517, when used in a 
chain polymerase reaction with DNA, amplifies only the DNA of 
the hybrids and HeLa cells and not the DNA of Chinese hamster 
cells. The primer and chain polymer reaction made it possible to 
detect human DNA in all of the clones analyzed, whereas 
conventional continuous cytometry only resulted in the 
preservation of human chromosome in one of the three clones 
analyzed. Figures 3, tables 2; references 13: 2 Russian, 11 
Western.

  [Abstract] One of the most promising trends in 
immunomorphology is the use of EIA, a variation of which is the 
peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. The discovery of new 
monoclonal antibodies allowing the identification of various 
antigens of normal and tumorous tissue has expanded the 
capabilities of morphological research. Peroxidase immunoassay 
has enabled the evaluation of local immunity and the 
morphological study of the role of various populations of 
lymphocytes in the immune response, as well as the 
identification of micrometastases in regional lymph nodes. 
Despite that, the technique is little used in Russia, because of 
the inadequate amount and inadequate variety of high-quality 
reagents and the small number of studies of the procedures 
associated with the technique. The researchers here developed a 
variation of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method that enables 
immunomorphological studies on cryostate sections of tissue of 
benign and malignant tumors of the mammary gland, as well as of 
regional lymphatic nodes removed in radical mastectomy. The work 
involved the monoclonal antibodies IKO-1, IKO-12, IKO-31, 
IKO-86, and IKO-90. Among the round-cell infiltrates both of 
benign and malignant tumors, the most pronounced expression was 
noted for the CD3 antigen, which is typical of T lymphocytes and 
was identified with IKO-90. CD3-positive cells were found to 
predominate. CD22- positive cells among the infiltrates was 
approximately equal to or a little more numerous than those with 
benign tumors, with a ratio of 1:2 in relation to CD3-positive 
cells. In regional lymphatic nodes without metastatic damage, 
IKO-90[.sup]+[/] cells were noted most often in the 
paracortical area as focal clusters. IKO- 12[.sup]+[/] cells 
were identified, as a rule, in lymphoid follicles as focal 
clusters. Usually, the center of the follicle was represented as 
B-cells, with lymphocytes on the periphery expressing CD4 and 
CD8 antigens. IKO-31[.sup]+[/] and - 86[.sup]+[/] cells 
were noted most often as clusters in the interfollicular 
regions. Lymphocytes labelled with the monoclonal antibodies of 
IKO-1 were found in the follicles, pulpy cords, and 
interfollicular regions. Figures 3, references 7: 5 Russian, 2

and/or used on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well 
as imported substances, are subject to State registration. 
  Substances containing impurities formed in the production 
process or when used are registered as individual substances. 
  1.6. Compound commercial chemicals, which must undergo 
hygienic certification in accordance with Decree No 1, dated 5 
January 1993, of the Goskomsanepidnadzor [Russian State 
committee for sanitary and epidemiological oversight], are not 
subject to State registration. 
  1.7. The procedure for State registration established in 
these Instructions does not extend to chemical and biological 
agents used to protect plants, farm crop and tree plantation 
growth regulators, pharmaceutical preparations, as well as 
radioactive substances, which are recorded or registered 
following previously established procedure by pertinent 
organizations. 
  1.8. Chemical and biological substances intended for 
production and use after 31 March 1993 (``new substances'') are 
subject to registration prior to production and use. 
  Substances produced, used and processed on the territory of 
the Russian Federation, as well as imported, prior to 31 March 
1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State 
registration within three years from the time of publication of 
these instructions. Specific registration dates must be 
coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1 
July 1993. 
<H5>  2. Procedure for State Registration </H5>
  2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are 
registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises, 
organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well 
as individuals responsible for production and import of a given 
substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership. 
  2.2. The registration process includes receiving 
applications, examining them and making the decision to 
register, and issuing a registration certificate. 
  2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration 
of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' 
which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for 
accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration. 
  2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be 
submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and 
area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to 
man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to 
registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State 
registration number and issuance of registration certificated 
with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of 
necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of 
submitted information is determined in each specific instance by 
the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and 
methodological documentation. 
  If an applicant does not submit the necessary information 
within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the 
registration certificate is no longer valid. 
  2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts, 
which is confirmed following established procedure, representing 
institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Russian Ministry 
of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases 
related to making decisions on State registration of potentially 
hazardous chemical and biological substances. 
  2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a 
State registration number and issuance of a registration 
certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological 
and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in 
standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST, 
TU and others) in the sections ``Safety requirements'' and 
``Environmental protection.'' 
  2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and 
use conditions for a substance with a State registration number 
to environmental protective and sanitary rules, adequacy of 
methods of assaying substances and conformity to NTD (GOST, TU, 
and others), as well as hygienic certification, are implemented 
by agencies of State sanitary and epidemiological oversight and 
Ministry Environmental Protection of the Russian Federation in 
accordance with sanitary and environment protective legislation. 
  2.8. Assignment of a State registration number and issuance 
of registration certificate are implemented on the basis of the 
expert finding of the Register's specialists and its approval by 
the director of the Register. 
  2.9. When registering a substance, the applicant remits 
payment in advance to the Register in accordance with the 
Statute approved by Decree No 552 of the Russian Federation 
Government dated 5 Aug 92, as well as for upgrading performance 
and material-technical support of the system of State 
registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological 
substances. 
  2.10. Applications for State registration are addressed in 
the name of the Register's director at 101479 Moscow, Vadkovskiy 
Lane, 18-20. 
  2.11. Documentation for registration must include: 
  2.11.1. a referral (cover letter) signed by an enterprise 
administrator or individual entrepreneur; 
  2.11.2. filled out ``List of information needed for State 
registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological 
substances'' (Appendix 1); 
  2.11.3. materials, on the basis which the ``List of 
information....'' was filled out; 
  2.11.4. payment authorization to pay for the registration 
fee; 
  2.11.5. official conclusion of the applicant as to possible 
publication of State registration materials in the free press. 
  2.12. Registration materials are to be examined within 30 
days. After assignment of a registration number, the Register 
issues a certificate of State registration of the established 
specimen (Appendix 2) and information form (Appendix 3) to the 
applicant, and publishes information about registration in the 
Register's information bulletin. 
  2.13. Validity of a registration certificate can be 
suspended by the Register if new data are received concerning 
previously unknown hazardous properties of a substance. The 
Register notifies the applicant of suspension of the 
registration certificate and/or ban on the substance within 10 
days of making this decision, and publishes this information in 
the Register's information bulletin. 
  2.14. The Register guarantees confidentiality of information 
about a substance that is an industrial secret unless it poses a 
threat to humanhealth and environmental safety. 
  2.15. The Register may, under specific conditions, 
rightfully refuse to issue a registration certificate. 
  2.16. An appeal of the Register's decision must be filed, no 
later than 30 days after it is made, with the chairman of the 
Russian Goskomsanepidnadzor. The appeal is examined within 30 
days. The decision of the chairman of the Russian 
Goskomsanepidnadzor may be appealed in Arbitration Court. 
  2.17. Enterprises and other business entities, regardless of 
the agency to which they pertain and form of ownership, 
organizations and institutions situated on the territory of the 
Russian Federation, individuals carrying out development, 
production and use, export and import of potentially hazardous 
chemical and biological substances bear responsibility in 
accordance with the ``Statute on State registration of 
potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' 
approved by Decree No 869 of the Russian Federation Government 
dated 12 November 1992.

First Tashkent Medical Institute; UDC 616.153.962.4-097] 
  [Abstract] Reports have been filed in recent years to the 
effect that with burns and a number of infectious diseases, 
specific antigens not only bind into immune complexes, but are 
also partially adsorbed on the surface of erythrocytes and 
thrombocytes. Although that is of diagnostic and predictive 
significance, methods for identifying antigens adsorbed on the 
surface of formed elements of the blood are procedurally 
complex, special equipment is required, and reagents are 
expensive. The researchers here have devised a simple, specific, 
fast method for identifying specific antigens -- salmonella and 
yersinia -- on the erythrocytes surface. The method, based on 
the fact that erythrocytes with adsorbed specific antigens enter 
into a hemagglutination reaction when they interact with 
specific antibodies, is called hemagglutination reaction with 
autoerythrocytes. The diagnostic value of the reaction was 
checked by means of examination of essentially healthy 
individuals and individuals with acute Flexner dysentery, viral 
hepatitis A, or staphylococcal diarrhea. In the healthy 
individuals and the individuals with dysentery and hepatitis A, 
in the presence of nonadsorbed agglutinating serum of salmonella 
and yersinia, the reaction was positive in titres of 1:5 and 
1:10. In individuals with salmonellosis and yersiniosis, in the 
presence of nonadsorbed agglutinating serum of salmonella and 
yersinia, the reaction was positive in 85 percent and 90 percent 
of the observations, in titres of 1:80 to 1:640. Reaction titre 
declined in a gradual, statistically reliable manner when the 
individuals' conditions improved. The researchers conclude that 
the diagnostic titre is 1:20 or higher. References 2 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Injury to the iris worsens considerably the 
post-traumatic process in ocular tissue, impairs visual 
function, and contributes to the development of corneal 
dystrophy, secondary glaucoma, and other complications that lead 
to work disability. Since reconstructive iridoplasty is one of 
the primary stages in the comprehensive treatment of 
anterior-segment pathology, the researchers here set out to 
evaluate the possibilities associated with optical 
reconstructive surgery involving artificial iris transplants 
developed at the Mikrokhirurgiya glaza complex. The transplant 
is prepared from a fundamentally new biosynthetic material -- a 
collagen copolymer with monomers of an acrylic series filled 
with inert dyes. In eight individuals, the clinical course of 
the postoperative period depended on the severity of the initial 
injury. In four individuals with earlier injury, local edema of 
the cornea in the scar area disappeared by the end of the second 
week. Stages 1 and 2 Tyndall phenomenon were no longer present 
by days 5 and 6 against the backdrop of steroid therapy. Minor 
hyperemia was observed for 5-6 days. Visual acuity improved to 
0.2-0.3 in four patients within a period of one week to three 
months. No specific complications were observed in the late 
postoperative period. Early postoperative response was less 
pronounced in two individuals with postsurgical colobomas. Two 
individuals with congenital cataract and aniridia, the 
postoperative course was uncomplicated. Visual acuity reached 
0.5 in two individuals, but vision was not completely restored, 
because of amblyopia. Figures 3, references 9: 8 Russian, 1

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Baranov, renowned </F>
scientist and physician, by Nikolay Vasilyev under the ``Be 
Healthy!'' rubric: ``Is the Family Necessary?''; first paragraph 
is boldface FEDERATSIYA introduction] 
  [Text] ``Family -- nucleus of society'' is a 
customary combination. [Family] is the foundation or base of any 
government. But who in our time is thinking about this very 
foundation? Decide for yourself -- What indeed is there to say 
about the family? Nevertheless it is today celebrating a 
singular anniversary. It is a year since the creation of the 
International Fund for the Protection of Motherhood and 
Childhood. And its president, the renowned scientist and 
physician A. Baranov has himself suggested talking with us about 
the current maternal and child health status in Russia because 
it is impossible to keep silent any longer. 
[Baranov] Evidently, a few statistics for a 
beginning. In Russia there has been a catastrophic decrease in 
the birth rate. This year the figure will amount to 
approximately 25 percent. This is an unprecedented for us. Such 
was not the case during the war. 
  Some are trying to prove that this is not really so bad. In 
Europe, for example, the birth rate has been traditionally low 
in recent years. Denmark, on whose level we are now, is cited as 
an example. These are false figures. The point is that when 
compared with the Danes, we have a 40-fold higher maternal 
mortality rate and a 5-fold higher child mortality rate. Are 
such incorrect comparisons -- we and they -- possible? 
  From the standpoint of perspective, it is better here to 
take 
Germany, Israel, and America, which have until recently 
stimulated immigration. They understand that the worker will 
make their government prosper and strengthen its power. They 
give shelter citizens from various countries of the world, and 
we unfortunately cannot take care of our own children and women. 
  Recently a new and dangerous trend has made itself known. 
The 
child mortality curve has moved upward since June 1991. I will 
mention that before then, it had decreased steadily for 3 years. 
The maternity hospitals in Moscow, and yes throughout all of 
Russia, today stand empty or half empty. I think the reasons are 
clear and common for all of society: the meagerness of 
financing, the lack of the most elementary drugs, the low 
salaries of medical personnel, etc. And indeed before the 
collapse of the Union a program was undertaken to construct 
modern maternity hospitals throughout the entire country. Now 
when will there be time for them? 
[Vasilyev] Excuse me, but why build if they are now 
standing empty? 
[Baranov] The trouble is that in our country health 
care has always seemed to be in the background of society. The 
things we just never built -- KamAzes [i.e., automobiles 
produced by the Kamsk Automotive Plant], canals, dams. The 
programs we just never thought of. The medicine we just never 
paid attention to. Maybe it's a commonplace situation. 
Specifically, the overwhelming number of our maternity hospitals 
are in old impractical buildings or buildings that are simply 
falling to pieces. That is why we must build. 
[Vasilyev] We have spoken with you about the birth 
rate. But what about maternal health... 
[Baranov]Here, as you understand, the situation is 
hardly any better. Four million abortions are performed in our 
country each year as opposed to 1,700,000 births. There is no 
larger number of abortions anywhere in the world, hence the 
maternal mortality and various female diseases and the overall 
health of the nation. 
  Our fund has chosen the task of family planning as its main 
direction. The question is whether to do something that should 
be a government task under the power of some fund. Of course 
not. Our goals are more modest. We want to help the government 
in this matter. 
  The point is that the fund has united in its ranks renowned 
specialists and scientists in the field of protecting maternal 
and child health. We already have departments open in Georgia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, the Crimea, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ivanovo, 
Khabarovsk, Irkutsk, and Stavropol. There is even a department 
in Washington, and one is now being registered in Belgium. Our 
intent is to make use of all of the advantages provided by this 
form of public organization, namely, speed, flexibility, and 
informality, in solving one problem or another. 
  What specifically have we set as our task? To begin a family 
planning campaign and, above all, to fight to reduce the number 
of abortions. Correct family planning can reduce maternal 
mortality by 40 percent and can cut the infant mortality rate in 
half. 
  And here, above all, the need for contraceptives must be 
met. 
We used to buy them. But it is impossible to live on purchases. 
We must create our own industry. We have found a Dutch firm 
called Organon that is examining our proposal to sell coils and 
Marvenol contraceptive tablets in Russia. The firm produces the 
world's best product of its type. In general, we feel that if 
some production process is created in Russia, it should be 
geared toward the highest-quality products. 
  Estimates show that it really possible to begin 
manufacturing 
coils and contraceptives by the end of 1993. We are planning to 
increase annual production to 7 million units plus 80 million 
packages of Marvenol. This will fully meet Russia's need. 
  Of course the fund cannot sustain such a gigantic program 
itself. Government help is needed. We have approached parliament 
with our proposals. It apparently supports our proposal and is 
now thinking of a way to provide more specific assistance. 
[Vasilyev]Production, as far as I can see, is only 
part of the problem. And what about the rest -- increasing the 
overall, let us say, medical level of service to mothers and the 
necessary consultations? 
[Baranov]You are right, the problem cannot be solved 
by the manufacture of contraceptives alone. We are also planning 
to create a network of women's medical centers in Russia. There 
they will see, first and foremost, women from what is called the 
high-risk group. They will be given the necessary examinations 
and consultations. 
  Such a center has already been created in Moscow based on 
the 
former Maternity Hospital imeni Guberman. The building lay empty 
for an entire year owing to pretensions of a 
sanitary-epidemiologic station. We asked Moscow's mayoralty to 
release it to the fund, and they met us halfway. Repairs are now 
under way there. We are hoping that the center will begin 
operating soon. It will be equipped with the most modern 
equipment. In a year we are planning to have as many as 50,000 
women seen in it. There is also an agreement with Nizhniy 
Novgorod to create an analogous center. 
  You understand, the fund is acting as a kind of catalyst. We 
know all the bottlenecks of our health care and, without waiting 
for the government to get moving, are trying to eliminate them. 
We have more than a few helpers abroad. We are very hopeful that 
when people learn more about our ideas and plans in our native 
Fatherland, they will come to our aid. 
[Vasilyev]Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, don't you have 
the feeling that all attempts to save medicine are doomed. It 
can collapse together with the entire economy. Unfortunately, 
all your good beginnings will not come to pass. 
[Baranov]I am an optimist by nature. If I adopt your 
philosophy of doom, I will have to fold my arms and wait for the 
end to come. But life goes on. And sooner or later the economy, 
and medicine along with it, will move uphill anyway. Our task is 
to help these processes. And how can one live without a future? 
  I would like to continue. We have implemented two more 
programs. One is related to vaccination, and the other involves 
baby food. 
  With respect to vaccination, we have begun working with the 
American firm Lederle, which is one of the world's two biggest 
firms in this area. It currently produces AKDS [expansion not 
given] vaccine, which is being used successfully against 
pertussis, diptheria, and measles. We found a place far from 
Moscow in Obolensk where facilities may be established to 
produce this vaccine. A study of the project is now under way. I 
will add that it is one of today's best. And we are maintaining 
our approaches here. 
  I think that one of the most complicated situations in 
Russia 
today is that of baby food. Our next program is related to just 
this problem. Previously, the USSR had five large factories 
producing baby food that met 60 percent of the country's need. 
Now after everyone has scattered to his own corner, only two 
factories remain in Russia. They meet only 40 percent of 
Russia's demand. The problem is most critical. We have reached 
an agreement with the leaders in the Stavropol Kray to construct 
a plant there. We have long been conducting talks with foreign 
firms on this score. There are two concrete partners; 
unfortunately, they have still not made a final decision. 
  But we also have our own developments in this area. 
Scientists from the Nizhniy Novgorod Microbiology and 
Epidemiology Scientific Research Institute and Pediatrics 
Scientific Research Institute have created a unique product that 
is a substitute for baby food -- lactobacteriosis. Its taste is 
reminiscent of foreign yogurt but it is much more valuable from 
the standpoint of its qualities. It may also be used 
successfully by workers in toxic industries, in the Chernobyl 
zone, and in regions of ecological trouble. 
  A shop producing this product is already operating at the 
Rossiya state farm [sovkhoz] near Nizhniy Novgorod. We had 
wanted to set up production at small shops producing this 
foodstuff. We have now found manufacturing shops based at a 
defense plant. Next year we are planning to launch 10 such 
shops. The process is simple, and the raw material is available. 
Eventually we want to increase facilities to launch 50 shops a 
year. The objective is to cover the entire country with such 
small shops producing baby food. 
[Vasilyev]These are alluring plans. But excuse my 
indelicate question. They are all just plans; is there anything 
concrete? 
[Baranov] The U.S. government has allocated $1.5 
million for creation of a Neonatal Intensive Care Center. We are 
organizing it on the basis of the Morozov Hospital in Moscow. 
Our partner in the United States is Norfolk Children's Hospital. 
The building is being renovated. Our physicians are training to 
work with the very latest equipment. The department will be open 
next year. The creation of another seven such centers is planned.

<F P=106> [Article; ``Donations for Russia: Do They Reach The </F>
Designated Recipient?''; first paragraph is TRUD introduction] 
  [Text]There was a delegation of the Russian Government 
Commission on Humanitarian and Scientific-Technical Aid, headed 
by A. A. Zhitnikov, its deputy chairman, in the FRG. It 
discussed matters of further collaboration, participated in 
preparation of a new document that deals with various aspects of 
relations between the two countries in this direction. Our Bonn 
correspondent, R. Kolchanov, took advantage of this opportunity 
to interview A. A. Zhitnikov: 
[Question] What is the extent of humanitarian aid and 
how large a part is Germany playing in it? 
[Answer] Humanitarian aid to Russia is coming from 
more than 60 countries. Last year, we received about 500,000 
tons of foodstuffs, as well as many drugs and medical equipment 
both along government lines and from hundreds of private 
organizations. In the first half of this year, the volume of 
food aid alone constituted a million tons. Germany's share is 
quite appreciable. Let me mention such major organizations as 
the German Red Cross and CARE-Deutschland. Of course, we have 
expressed our most sincere appreciation to all donors who have 
to exert much effort to collect and transport food. 
[Question] The aid is intended primarily for the 
socially depressed population strata in Russia.... 
[Answer] According to our estimates, they constitute 
30-35 million people: pensioners, invalids, large families, 
refugees who have left their homeland because of conflict 
situations. 
[Question] Humanitarian aid is usually given for a 
specific, short period of time, but the factors you have 
mentioned will apparentlyprevail, regrettably, for a long time 
to come in our country. Shall we seek aid in the future also? 
[Answer]In the difficult transitional period that 
Russia is experiencing, millions of people are in need of social 
support. The government is making an utmost effort to alleviate 
their situation, but we do not have enough funds. As of June, 
the deficit in the budget earmarked for social programs 
constituted about 150 million rubles, and this does not include 
health care or expenses related to migration. We are trying to 
bridge the gap at the expense of humanitarian aid. For example, 
deliveries, in the form of aid, of American grain will enable us 
to get about 25 billion rubles to support the needy. In this 
regard, we are negotiating with other governments as well. So 
that humanitarian aid to Russia is simply a necessity for the 
time being. 
[Question] Does it really reach the people for whom 
it is intended and to a full measure? 
[Answer]There are representatives of different 
departments, nongovernment organizations and clergy in our 
Commission. There are local humanitarian aid headquarters. 
Administration heads are personally responsible for its 
distribution. In recent years direct contacts are developing, 
and we are encouraging this: hospital to hospital, city to city, 
and foreign children's institutions to ours. 
[Question] Still, there are quite a few reports, 
including some in the German mass media, to the effect that some 
of the aid is being stolen and sold through speculative entities. 
[Answer] Humanitarian aid from foreign countries is 
handled in two ways: it is sent directly to the needy, or it is 
sold. For example, you cannot deliver grain from door to door, 
and the proceeds from it go to pensioners, students and school 
lunches. That was the case, for example, with the 155,000 tons 
of food received through the Commission of European Communities. 
In Moscow, the proceeds from selling it constituted 4.6 billion 
rubles and in St. Petersburg, 2.5 billion. The moneys went to 
the needy. 
  We proceeded similarly with the 18,000 tons of American 
butter, 100,000 tons of Taiwan rice and several other forms of 
humanitarian aid. I should like to stress that, in principle, we 
coordinate our actions with the donors who deliver these 
products to us. Our aim is to have part of the humanitarian aid 
used ``for the future,'' for development of production. 
[Question] The Commission does not have its own 
shops. Through what channels is such aid implemented? 
[Answer] We are making a careful study of the 
capabilities of those who express the wish to participate in 
handling products received as aid. Sale is categorically 
prohibited without the Commission's special permission. The 
entire process is reflected in documentation, and we monitor it 
through the pertinent departments. 
[Question] Nevertheless, one can find products 
obviously received in the form of humanitarian aid in numerous 
stands loaded with alcoholic beverages and smoking materials. 
[Answer] We have checked this repeatedly. We learned 
that the products are offered to the stand owners by those who 
received them as aid in order to use the proceeds for other, 
more needed items. We are much more concerned with the instances 
of direct stealing. 
[Question] Is there much theft? 
[Answer]The losses from theft constituted about 35 
million rubles. Of course, this is very sad and outrageous. But 
the losses related to selling items of humanitarian aid are much 
lower, as compared to the total aid which amounted to about 35 
billion rubles last year, than in ordinary trade. It is nonsense 
that the commercial structures supposedly get rich from this 
aid. Anyone who sells products with our permission sets prices 
that are slightly below market prices for speedy sale, and is 
compensated only for inevitable expenses, for example, transport. 
  The Commission, however, does not spend a single ruble of 
deductions from humanitarian aid to maintain its staff of 18 
people. 
[Question] However, you are the target of unfavorable 
criticism? 
[Answer] I wish to note that humanitarian aid is 
often used in Russia as an arena for political battle. What sins 
have not been placed upon us! However, recently, a commission of 
the Ministry of Finance Control Administration failed to find 
any abuses in our performance. 
[Question]I should like to hope that soon potentially 
wealthy Russia will no longer have to seek help in foreign 
countries.... 
[Answer] We are experiencing a very difficult period, 
but there is no turning back. The road ahead toward implementing 
reforms, with consideration of present needs and interests of 
the socially less protected strata of the population, should 
ultimately lead to success.

Clinical Residencies, signed by P. N. Morozov, chief of 
Administration of Educational Institutions, addendum to Order No 
23 of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health, dated 17 Feb 93] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  General statutes </H5>
  1. Clinical residence is a part of the multilevel structure 
of higher medical education in the Russian Federation, a form of 
continuous professional education of physicians at higher 
medical educational institutions and research institutions, 
medical departments of universities, institutes for advanced 
training of physicians, which is carried out in order to train 
or retrain specialists, as well as to upgrade their 
qualifications. 
  2. The right of institutions mentioned in Item 1 to train 
physicians in the form of clinical residency is granted by the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Health upon submittal of 
appropriate petition, excerpt from the record of decision of the 
scientific council and description of basic equipment of the 
institution with subsequent licensing of such institution. 
  3. The main object of having physicians take clinical 
residencies is to train highly qualified specialists for 
independent work in health care agencies and institutions, or in 
private practice. 
  4. Clinical residents are trained according to specialties 
specified in the existing ``List of medical specialties,'' and 
in accordance with the curriculum and syllabus for each 
specialty. According to the Russian Federation Law ``On 
Education,'' the mandatory minimum of the professional syllabus 
for a specific medical specialty is determined by the pertinent 
State standard. The syllabuses for clinical residency and 
curriculums are approved by the scientific councils of 
institutions that train clinical residents, and they are revised 
every 5 years, with consideration of changes in the State 
standard for educational minimum of professional syllabus for 
each specialty. 
  5. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health reserves the 
right to terminate physician training in the form of clinical 
residency in institutions where such work is not organized 
satisfactorily. 
  6. Clinical residency training takes place away from the 
main 
workplace. Training lasts 2 years. If the scientific council of 
the institution providing clinical resident training raises the 
question of extending clinical residency to 5 years, permission 
is granted by the Russian Federation Ministry of Health on an 
individual basis, depending on the specialty of training. 
Residencies start on 1 September. 
<H5>  Clinical residency acceptance and training </H5>
  1. Physicians participate in competitions to be accepted for 
clinical residency. Citizens of other nations, as well as 
physicians referred by cost-accounting and departmental (with 
the exception of those under the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Health) medical institutions and organizations enroll for 
clinical residence in medical educational and research 
institutions of the Russian Federation on a contractual basis, 
unless other procedures are stipulated in existing legislation. 
  2. All clinical residency entrants enjoy equal rights, 
regardless of social origin and financial status, race and 
ethnicity, sex, language, attitude toward religion, type and 
nature of work, and place of residence. Restrictions are 
permitted only on medical contraindications, as well as in cases 
stipulated by Russian Federation legislation. 
  3. The rules for acceptance to a clinical residency 
(conditions, procedure and time of acceptance, number and forms 
of examinations, rating criteria) are established by 
institutions that train physicians in clinical residency, they 
are approved by decision of the scientific councils of these 
institutions and must be published no later than 3 months prior 
to receipt of documentation. 
  4. Individuals who have passed examinations and competition 
have the right to be enrolled for a clinical residency. 
  5. To carry out clinical residency enrollment, the 
administrator of the educational (research) institution 
announces a competition with a time limit of at least 1 month 
for applications, he appoints an acceptance commission chairman 
and approves its members. The acceptance commission comprises 
representatives of the main clinical specialties. 
  6. Target numbers for enrolling physicians in a clinical 
residence are approved annually by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Health and reported to health care institutions and 
agencies in January-February for the next school year. 
Enrollment in clinical residence on a contractual basis is 
carried out by institutions that have the right to train 
clinical residents in excess of the target enrollment numbers 
approved by the ministry. Reports on filling clinical residency 
spaces in the current year and applications for the next year 
are submitted to the Russian Federation Ministry of Health no 
later than 1 October of each year, with indication of 
specialties and bases of proposed training. The reports must 
indicate: --number of physicians accepted for residency 
(separately, according to target enrollment numbers and 
contracts);--training specialty; --agencies (institutions, 
organizations) who referred specialists for training 
(separately, according to target enrollment numbers and 
contracts). 
  7. The application for acceptance in a clinical residency is 
addressed in the name of the administrator of the institution 
that trains clinical residents, with enclosure of: --personnel 
record form [ID] with photo, endorsed by the personnel 
department, from the last place of employment or study (those 
who have been unemployed for over 1 year fill out the form used 
for personnel records at the place to which documentation is 
submitted); --curriculum vitae; --referral-recommendation from 
the last place of employment (study) describing the level of 
professional training, business and organizational traits of 
applicant, with indication of specialty and purpose of training, 
and institution to which documentation is submitted for 
enrollment in clinical residency (for individuals enrolling by 
special referral and who have worked (studied) at least 1 year 
prior to submitting documentation for enrollment in clinical 
residency); --copy of graduation diploma from higher medical 
educational institution; --passport, military card, and labor 
book [work permit and record] are submitted personally by the 
candidate for clinical residency. 
  8. Travel expenses for individuals referred to specialized 
clinical residency and after its completion are paid by the 
referring organizations (institutions). The return trip for 
individuals who failed in the competition is also paid by the 
referring organizations (institutions). Individuals who did not 
complete their individual training program and whose clinical 
residency was terminated prematurely pay for their own return 
trip. 
  9. Physicians who have passed the competition for clinical 
residency are excused from work by administrators of 
institutions (organizations), in accordance with existing 
legislation. A pertinent letter from the educational or research 
institution that provides training of clinical residents serves 
as grounds for such action. 
  10. Physicians undergoing clinical residency training are 
paid a stipend at the expense of the training institution, in an 
amount set by the pertinent enforceable enactments or an amount

<F P=106> [Article by Russian Academy of Medical Sciences Academician </F>
Pavel Sergeyev: ``Pills to Cure Developed Idiocy: How We Became 
a Medicine-Free Power''] 
  [Text] Much is being said 
and written today about the chaos and confusion reigning in 
pharmaceutical support to the Russian population. But this 
catastrophical situation did not come about all at once. Our 
current woes are bitter payment for entire decades of 
thoughtless decisions and actions. 
  My career in pharmaceuticals began many years ago. In the 
early 1970s I was already the director of the department of 
molecular pharmacology and radiobiology at the Moscow Medical 
Institute No 2. Once I had the occasion to talk with a certain 
highly placed worker at the USSR Council of Ministers on the 
state of medical science. I said then that in another 10-15 
years our state would be completely dependent upon the West for 
pharmaceuticals. Domestic medical industry was developing at a 
loss, a large share of capital investments was being sent to the 
GDR, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria, while our 
pharmaceutical factories were shutting down. A crisis was to be 
expected. I was asked to write all of this down and take the 
materials over to the Council of Ministers. 
  I worked daily for a month and a half on my concept of the 
state of pharmaceutical science in the country. Then, after 
sending the materials I began waiting for a response. But 
unfortunately no one made the effort to answer me. Then I sent a 
letter to the CPSU Central Committee. Once again there was no 
reply. 
  In the heyday of perestroyka I was invited together with 
Academician M. Mashkovskiy and Academician R. Glushkov to join 
Gorbachev's staff, and we were asked to draft a presidential 
edict on pharmaceuticals. For 3 months we conducted serious 
analytical work, which culminated in a draft edict. It's not 
known whose fault it was, but this edict never was signed. For 
years I appeared before public health committees of the Russia 
and the USSR, roamed the ministry hallways, and expended energy 
trying to prove something patently obvious--people need 
pharmaceuticals as much as they need bread. 
  In late 1991 a concrete, fully thought out Russian state 
program was finally drawn up and approved. The strategic line of 
development of pharmaceutical science and of provision of 
medicines to the population was finally defined ``on paper.'' 
But alas, once again things never went farther than this. 
  As before, the country continues to lack a unified program 
of 
research in pharmacology. We have over 40 medical VUZes, and all 
of them have pharmacology departments, but no one is 
coordinating their work. The absence of planning and control 
encourages inactivity. 
  On the other hand the road that must be traveled by 
medicines 
already in existence to the patient is infinitely complex and 
long. So much coordination with numerous committees, commissions 
and experts councils must be done! It takes an average of 10-12 
years to create a new pharmaceutical, while the process of 
introduction sometimes drags on for decades! Often an original 
preparation that we could have produced for ourselves and sold 
abroad grows obsolete, never getting beyond the paperwork stage. 
In the meantime in developed countries it usually takes 2-3 
years to introduce a high quality preparation. 
  Why does this happen? There's no secret here. We simply lack 
a nationwide system for the synthesis and introduction of 
pharmaceuticals, and we do not have a unified sector producing 
them. Throughout the world, pharmaceuticals are made by huge 
firms in which the processes of scientific development of 
pharmaceuticals and their introduction into production are 
combined. In our country we do not have a single firm of this 
kind. And consequently a preparation that comes into being in 
some university department also often ``dies'' there, having 
been unable to make it into production. Another misfortune lies 
in the fact that our pharmaceutical enterprises have fallen far 
behind modern requirements in terms of their equipment. 
  As I see it, one of the greatest misfortunes is the absence 
of state orders for medicinal resources. Consequently we also 
lack a program for providing the country with pharmaceuticals, 
one based on a clear idea of what we have for today, what 
preparations are suitable for use, and which have become 
hopelessly obsolete, what will be needed tomorrow, including the 
amount that will have to be purchased abroad, and precisely what 
will have to purchased there. We do not have any kind of service 
that could determine the population's demand for 
pharmaceuticals, draw up state orders, and distribute 
pharmaceuticals in optimum fashion! 
  No country in the world can completely satisfy its demand 
for 
pharmaceuticals by its own production. Japan for example, which 
has a highly developed pharmaceutical industry, imports many 
more pharmaceuticals than it exports. Clearly it would be 
impossible and unsuitable for Russia to do away with imports of 
pharmaceuticals. But today the ratio between exports and imports 
is 1:20. This is of course extremely disadvantageous to the 
country, which has all of the potential to make this ratio equal 
to 1:2 or 1:3. 
  In the last year the pharmaceutical supply situation became 
even more tragic. The collapse of the economy, and the 
tumultuous and inarticulate confusion in the higher echelons of 
power have had a devastating effect on the supply of 
pharmaceuticals to the common people. The pharmacies are empty, 
while the warehouses are overfilled--they are holding 
pharmaceuticals back in anticipation of new, even fantastically 
higher prices. What is the Russian Ministry of Health doing in 
this situation? 
  In the last 15-20 years--that is after it was separated out 
of the Ministry of Medical and Microbiological Industry, the 
Ministry of Health has done nothing about pharmaceuticals, and 
for practical purposes it has even avoided drawing up state 
orders. 
  The Extraordinary Pharmaceutical Committee was organized in 
August 1991, but because of its total incompetence it didn't do 
anything, and it was soon abolished. 
  Then Academician A. I. Vorobyev organized an expert council 
on pharmaceuticals when he became minister. His work also 
recalled running in place. When the council held meetings, 
foreign firms always had their ears to the wall, and their 
interests were defended by experts discussing the fate of a 
given preparation. And in my opinion it was not until the new 
minister assumed his post that we finally began fighting the 
flawed system of distributing and selling pharmaceuticals, one 
in which the state appropriated millions of rubles' worth of 
foreign currency to acquire pharmaceuticals abroad, while 
patients continued to remain without therapeutic assistance. 
``Glorious'' was the legacy left to the new minister. Western 
states had given us loans for the purchase of pharmaceuticals, 
but as a result of unforgivable mismanagement they were returned 
unused. Large sums of foreign currency idled in safes of the 
Pharmacological Committee. Its former chairman visited companies 
in different countries of the world 10-15 times each year. And 
even now he continues to manage international ties in the 
Pharmacological Committee! 
  The new minister is not responding to the administration's 
lead, he is trying to fight it, and this does him honor. But it 
is very important for him to create a team of people around him 
from different fields of pharmacological industry and 
pharmacological science, a team of honest people of like mind. 
It is extremely necessary to distribute orders for imported 
preparations as quickly as possible--after all, thousands of 
people are waiting! 
  And of course, we need to change the system under which all 
hard currency is transferred to local public health departments. 
Pharmaceutical merchants have rushed headlong to them, easily 
finding a common language with people who have little 
understanding of the highly complex issues of purchasing 
imported preparations. The coordinating role must remain with 
the Center. Otherwise this idiotic waste of state resources will 
continue unavoidably. And after all, we have very few of these 
resources left.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prof Yuriy Mikhaylovich Komarov, </F>
corresponding member of the Academy of Technological Sciences 
and doctor of medical sciences, by Albert Kozlov; place and date 
of interview not given: ``What Are We Eating, What Are We 
Breathing? The Health of Russians: The Situation is Extremely 
Alarming''] 
  [Text] Until the late 1980s Russia's population 
growth exhibited a stable trend--3.5-7 percent every 5 years. In 
1991 we reached the mark at which the coefficient of natural 
growth was only 0.7 per thousand residents, and beginning in 
1992 the population actually began to decrease. The number of 
deaths exceeded the number of births by 204,000 people. This 
year this process has accelerated. 
  A TRUD correspondent asked Professor Yu. Komarov, doctor of 
medical sciences, corresponding member of the Academy of 
Technological Sciences and general director of the 
Medsotsekonominform Scientific-Production Association, to 
comment on so lamentable a fact. 
  [Komarov] In and of itself, zero population growth or even a 
decrease in population is a widespread phenomenon in the world. 
However, Russia's situation is unique in that the transition to 
a natural decrease is caused chiefly by a decrease in the birth 
rate. In the last 5 years 900,000 persons were born in our 
country, or 36 percent less than in the preceding 5 years, and 
if we include 1992, the number is 195,000 less. The birth rate 
in Russia has become the lowest among developed countries. 
  The second factor influencing the population decrease is a 
sharp worsening of the health of people and growth of mortality. 
This raises the problem of the health and life span of the 
population to the rank of national problems determining the 
survival and prospects of the nation. 
  The decline in birth rate and health is a consequence of the 
socioeconomic and ecological crisis, the low level of financing 
of public health, insufficient flexibility of its structures, 
and the absence of any strategy in this direction. 
  [Kozlov] It has usually been believed that assets invested 
directly into the development of public health produce the 
greatest impact in improving the people's health. But today the 
principal causes of morbidity and mortality are associated with 
living conditions and way of life. 
  [Komarov] That would be the most correct approach to take to 
this problem. The quality of life of Russians may be portrayed 
in general form as follows. In 1985 we were 68th in the world in 
gross production per capita, and 77th in level of personal 
consumption. This was respectively 39.9 and 25.8 percent of the 
levels in the USA. In the past year the standard of living of 
Russians dropped further by a factor of two. Consumer prices 
increased by 26 times (in 1992), while average wages increased 
by only 13 times, and the rate of growth of pensions and 
assistance was a third behind the growth of wages. This year 
these indicators are even more deplorable. 
  A drop in real income has resulted in a worsening of the 
consumption structure. The proportion of food expenses in the 
family budget grew by an average of 60 percent (85 among the 
poorest and pensioners); in this case consumption of meat, oils, 
vegetables and fruits decreased by a time and a half. On the 
other hand consumption of potatoes and grain products of lesser 
value in dietary respects increased. Hence the protein shortage 
in the Russian diet was 25 percent, the vitamin C shortage was 
50 percent and the group B and A vitamin shortage was 20-30 
percent. 
  Paradoxical as it may seem, people in countries in which the 
quality of protects against avitaminosis gulp down vitamin 
supplements. In our country, where the diet lacks in nutritional 
respects, the situation is reversed. The vitamins we produce of 
such low volume (not to mention their quality) that if we were 
to give them to all Russians, each person would receive only one 
multiple-vitamin pill a year. In the meantime in order to 
satisfy the country's demand at the Western level, we would need 
to spend just $1.50 per Russian on the development of domestic 
industry. 
  [Kozlov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what influence is the 
ecological 
situation in the country having on our health? 
  [Komarov] Over 60 million Russians live under conditions in 
which the maximum permissible concentrations of toxins in the 
air are continually exceeded. Approximately half of our 
population drinks water that fails to satisfy hygienic 
requirements. The work places of around 5 million persons in 
industry and a million in construction and transportation fail 
the safety standards, while 4.3 million work in conditions under 
which the concentration of toxins in the air of the work zone 
exceeds the standard. 
  In order for the scale of ecological contamination to become 
more understandable, let me say that each year over 50 million 
tons of exhausts from enterprises and motor transportation enter 
the air: This is 400 kilograms for every Russian. And in cities 
like Berezniki, Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, Magnitogorsk, Novokuznetsk, 
Norilsk and Perm--a total of 84 cities--morbidity is 1.5-2 times 
higher than the country average. 
  [Kozlov] Your scientific-production association analyzed the 
causes of worker mortality. What diseases kill Russians most 
often? 
  [Komarov] It will seem strange, but what took first place in 
1991 was suicide. Let me say right away that it is provoked by 
social problems and stress. A high percentage of losses also 
comes from work-related injury. And among diseases, circulatory 
ailments, neoplasms, and diseases of the respiratory and 
digestive tract have the lead. 
  The structure of health impairments is now determined 
chiefly 
by long-lasting chronic diseases. Once again there is a direct 
relationship to the state's strategy in health protection: We 
need a two- or three-time increase in outlays on public health, 
and an increase of several times on improvement of the 
environment and development of the social infrastructure. But 
the new powers are as hesitant to provide money for the health 
of people as were the former ones. This is why infectious 
diseases have begun spreading in our country once again. There 
are increasingly larger numbers of cases of acute intestinal 
infections, salmonellosis and viral hepatitis--many hundreds of 
thousands of cases per year. Cholera, which has been forgotten 
by most developed countries, is revealing itself more and more 
frequently. Tuberculosis is returning. 
  Women are a special problem. In the last 3 years their 
morbidity increased abruptly in connection with absence of 
proper diet, because of the shortage of proteins, vitamins and 
microelements. Maternal mortality is very high--four to five 
times higher than in developed countries. By the way, not a 
single developed country in the world has so many women dying 
from abortions as we do (Russia can be compared only to 
Tanzania). Moreover death could be prevented in 60 out of 100 
cases. 
  [Kozlov] Are things any better with the health of men? 
  [Komarov] Unfortunately Russia is one of those countries in 
which ``supermortality'' among men is especially pronounced. In 
comparison with women, the mortality indicators for men of young 
and middle working age are four to five times higher. Only 
around 70 percent of urban and around 60 percent of rural men 
live to 60. In comparison with the USA, the FRG, Japan, France 
and Great Britain, men of what we might call ``working age'' die 
2.5 times more frequently in our country. 
  [Kozlov] The figures are saddening, if not tragic. Is there 
a 
solution? 
  [Komarov] Our country's leadership must finally realize the 
simple truths. First, without health, there cannot be a healthy 
economy. And second, if the necessary emergency measures are not 
implemented very soon, in 7-15 years Russia will transform into 
a degraded society. While in developed countries up to 10-12 
percent of the gross national product is allocated to public 
health, in our country no more than 3-4 percent is allocated. 
Each year more than $2,500 are spent per capita in the USA, 
while in our country 6,500 rubles were planned in 1993. 
  Each time, statistical bodies publish increasingly more 
alarming data indicating a decrease in life span and birth rate, 
growth in the number of suicides and murders, of venereal 
diseases, of alcoholics and drug addicts, congenital 
deformities, and disengagement of the people's ``moral 
restraints.'' These are manifestations of a chronic disease in 
society, a menacing warning that unless the dangerous trends are 
curtailed, the country and the people may find themselves 
without a future. This danger is more terrifying than the 
economic and political crisis. 
  Today, there are practically no illusions left regarding the 
possibility for reforming our economic system swiftly, in a few 
years. Therefore despite the slogans, the social sphere, 
including public health, will once again be financed on the 
basis of the residual principle, and it will experience even 
further degradation. 
  Sad as it may be, the conclusion we are forced to reach is 
this: The people's health is in serious jeopardy.

  [Text] Georgos Apostolopulos, a well known Greek 
businessman and the director of the Athens Medical Center, sent 
a large consignment of medications to Moscow as a gift to the 
Russian Ministry of Health. 
  G. Apostolopulos's medical center has been interacting 
closely with Russian medical personnel for a long time. He 
opened a first aid station in Moscow equipped with special 
machines for outpatient care brought in from Greece, there is a 
diagnostic center, and other forms of cooperation are 
developing. One other act of humanitarian assistance was carried 
out in G. Apostolopulos's Athens clinic--an extremely complex 
heart operation free of charge on Kseniya Lukidis, a girl from 
St. Petersburg whom doctors in Russia were unable to cure. 
  ``Russia is a country with extremely rich resources, with 
talented people who like to work,'' said the Greek businessman. 
``Having gained their freedom, your people will be able to 
progress and flourish very quickly. The West needs to do more 
than just provide humanitarian assistance: It should also 
cooperate with Russia, it should not fear investing capital into 
its economy, and it should supply new technology. All of this 
will ultimately be advantageous to both sides.''

Problems Institute, Russian Federation Ministry of Health, 
Moscow; UDC 612.822.014.46:577.175.537] 
  [Abstract] Existing and newly published data on the 
mechanisms of the reaction of a number of structures of the 
brain and pituitary-adrenal system under stress were examined. 
Published information on the following topics was examined: the 
role of the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic structures (the 
hippocampus, tonsils, septum, and reticular formation); the role 
of the adrenergic, seritoninergic, and cholinergic systems of 
the hypothalamus-reticulum-limbic complex; the role of 
neuropeptides; and delta-sleep inducing peptide [DSIP] and its 
biological role. In addition, the regulation of the 
pituitary-adrenal system and the functional activity and 
intercenter interrelationship of the structures of the brains in 
a stressed state of aggressive-defensive behavior and the 
effects of corticosteroids and DSIP were examined in a study of 
982 adult male rats. The rat studies established that the 
development of aggressive-defensive behavior results in a marked 
restructuring of the functional activity of the 
hypothalamic-reticular-limbic structures and cerebral cortex, as 
well as in a change in the nature of intercenter 
interrelationships that correlate with a change in the content 
of corticosterone and DSIP in blood plasma. Specifically, the 
stressed state of aggressive-defensive behavior was accompanied 
by an elevation of corticosterone level from 12.29 +/- 0.5 to 
126.1 +/- 1.5 mmol/l and a decrease in DSIP from 388.1 +/- 41.06 
to 242.3 +/- 31.88 fmol/l. Also during aggressive-defensive 
behavior, the bioelectric activity of the rats' brains 
manifested a change in theta-rhythm spectrum, the integral 
strength of which (in æV/s) in the hippocampus rose from 18.8 
+/- 3.6 (background) to 6.1 +/- 5.9. Theta-activity in the 
hippocampus thus increased from 31 to 54 percent. In the 
ventromedial hypothalamus theta-activity increased from 17 to 43 
percent, and in the reticular formation of the midbrain it 
increased from 31 to 37 percent (this change was coupled with 
increases in respiration and heart rates). The correlation 
between DSIP level and corticosterone level during 
aggressive-defensive behavior was seen as especially noteworthy. 
Exogenous injection of DSIP against the background of advanced 
stress resulted in myorelaxation and elimination of aggression. 
Injection of DSIP before the development of aggressive-defensive 
behavior led to a decrease in corticosterone level from 12.29 
+/- 0.5 to 9.64 +/- 0.7 mmol/l and to a less pronounced increase 
in the level of corticosterone in the rats' blood plasma after 
the onset of aggressive-defensive behavior than occurred without 
the injection of DSIP. New data regarding the 
structurofunctional organization of the inhibitory process under 
the effect of DSIP during aggressive-defensive behavior and the 
significant integration of nervous and hormonal factors in the 
mechanisms of its development were also obtained. DSIP was 
determined to function as a natural tranquilizer that increases 
resistance to stress. References 80: 19 Russian, 61 Western.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Pokrovskiy: ``The Academy Again Demands </F>
Saltykov's Blood''] 
  [Text] From what we see on the television and read in the 
newspapers we know that Yuriy Osipov, president of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, is extremely concerned with the financial 
situation of academic science and is especially upset by the 
circumstance that an individual item ``Russian Academy of 
Sciences,'' the backbone of Russian fundamental science, has 
disappeared in the draft budget for 1994. 
  Yuriy Osipov blames the loss of the item directly on two 
Borises: Boris Fedorov, Minister of Finance, and Boris Saltykov, 
Minister of Science and Technical Policy. In the opinion of the 
RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) Presidium, which was expressed 
on 14 December in an appeal of the academicians to Boris 
Yeltsin, these two ministers are intentionally and 
systematically destroying the Academy. A resolution of the RAN 
Presidium dated 21 December already contains a threat of public 
denunciation of the mentioned Borises. 
  In the appeal to the president the indignant scientists 
proposed that an end be put to this disgraceful situation and 
that all fundamental research in the country be conveyed to the 
oversight of the Academy of Sciences and that the Ministry of 
Science and Technical Policy be eliminated. The leaders of the 
Academy are by no means submitting this appeal for the first 
time. But for the first time all these conversations are no 
longer confined to the offices and are reaching a broad public. 
And perhaps for the first time the ``immortals'' are quite close 
to their desired objective. The dogfight has ended and war has 
been declared. 
  The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy is being 
bombarded with angry telephone calls: ``How could you? How dare 
you leave academic science without funds for its existence?'' 
Andrey Fonotov, the deputy minister, shrugs his shoulders in 
perplexity. In his opinion the panic arose due to a 
misunderstanding. 
  ``We thought that this matter was settled long ago. After 
all, the new draft of the budget in which this item is missing 
was sent out to all interested departments last summer. And it 
was not the Academy, but we who drew the attention of the 
Ministry of Finance to this detail. The draft was very inept and 
we sent it back with a great many critical comments; on 28 
October the ministry agreed with our criticism and the Academy 
item was returned to its rightful place. It is strange that 
Yuriy Osipov was not interested in learning the true status of 
matters from the Minister of Science and Technology before 
dashing off one denunciation after another.'' 
  But, from all appearances, the RAN president did not clarify 
the status of matters because this was not in his interests. 
Available facts make it necessary to assume that he had to have 
a panic precisely at that postelection moment when Boris Yeltsin 
announced an impending reduction in the number of ministries and 
their personnel. The panic was necessary around any problem, 
even if it be nonexistent. We find it difficult to believe that 
the leaders of the Academy, with all their friendly 
relationships to the president and prime minister of the 
country, had no access to the last draft of the budget. 
  But the facts are as follows. Already on 14 September 
Nikolay 
Malyshev, an advisor to the president of Russia on science and 
education, sent a memorandum to Yeltsin in which he proposed 
that of which the RAN Presidium is now proposing -- conveyance 
of all fundamental science to the oversight of the Academy and 
abolition of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. Then 
the dispersal of parliament occurred and the seat of Boris 
Saltykov for the first time in many months ceased to shake. The 
Minister of Science and Technical Policy as a member of the 
Gaydar camp during this unconstitutional period was completely 
untouchable. As soon as the elections had ended in the way we 
know they did the Malyshev memorandum with the presidential 
decision ``examine'' was laid on the desk of Yegor Gaydar. 
  The Malyshev proposals taken separately could scarcely harm 
the ministry -- the accusations made so little corresponded to 
reality. The ministry was accused of an excessive expansion of 
staffing at the very same time when the personnel rolls were 
being significantly reduced; due to low salaries people are now 
fleeing from the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. The 
ministry was accused of working ``in the old style'' in that no 
one there was occupied with anything but ``petty details and the 
distribution of funds.'' But it is hard to call a ``petty 
detail'' the organization of new structures of the state 
scientific center type, which has literally rescued from 
collapse several tens of very large scientific organizations in 
the country. It is difficult to call work ``in the old style'' 
the method, completely new for us, for distribution of funds by 
scientists themselves: reference is to the organization of a 
Russian Fund for Fundamental Research. This fund, incidentally, 
despite all the criticism directed at it, has invigorated much 
neglected research. ``Instead of complaining,'' said one 
scientist, ``we are now filling out applications for grants.'' 
  In a preelection meeting with scientists Boris Saltykov 
spoke 
of establishing a similar fund for specialists in the 
humanities, a Technological Fund, the possibility of 
establishing a fund for payment of thousand-dollar stipends to 
representatives of the scientific elite of the country. Now 
everything may end in a crash. 
  The Malyshev proposals, supported by the surprisingly 
similar 
proposals of the RAN Presidium, multiplied by a precisely 
selected moment in time, may still topple the minister hated by 
the Academy. According to information from the government 
apparat, a paper already lies on the desk of Boris Yeltsin 
providing for the abolition of the Ministry of Science and in 
its stead the organization of a department of science affairs. 
Malyshev, naturally, is to be named to this post. He once was 
the former Minister of Science and Technical Policy, sure, for 
an entire month. 
  ``The ministry in its present-day form is not the most ideal 
structure for leading science from a state close to clinical 
death,'' says Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Russian 
Consultative Council of the International Science Fund, an 
active supporter of science reforms, who more likely could be 
called an opponent rather than an admirer of the Ministry of 
Science and Technical Policy. ``The ministry is frequently 
criticized and at times very correctly. Like any Russian 
department it acts very slowly and each new thing that comes 
along -- be it regulations on preferential taxes for 
international philanthropic organizations or the setting up of a 
new fund -- is dealt with only with excessive difficulty. 
However, this is the sole department which is taking steps in 
the right direction, something not characteristic of Soviet 
administrative methods. If the ministry is abolished and the 
funding of fundamental research is returned to the Academy 
Russian scientists might as well put on mourning -- hopes for 
improvement in the situation are low even without this and they 
will decrease virtually to zero. Experience has shown that the 
only thing which the leadership of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences can do effectively is to ask for money. The Academy 
Presidium is not capable of carrying out reforms making it 
possible to conserve scientific potential because any of these 
reforms lessens its authority. It is capable only of dragging 
out the agony and making it irreversible.'' 
  A short addendum to this article. 
  The poor Russian Academy of Sciences, constantly whining 
about budget support, has at its disposal, for example, several 
recreational facilities, including one held jointly with an 
Austrian company -- the five-star ``Palace Hotel.'' Still 
another five-star hotel is located on the grounds of the Organic 
Biology Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, where an 
automobile shop also is in operation. Just what is done with the 
considerable hard currency receipts is unknown. In particular, 
in checking the Palace Hotel one discovers unaccounted for cash 
receipts of 860 thousand real American dollars belonging to the 
Academy. It must be surmised that they were not very necessary 
to the scientists or have been laid away for a rainy day.

<F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenkova: ``Russian Academy of </F>
Sciences and Ministry of Science Play Montague and Capulet. The 
Story of an Item in the State Budget is Coming to a Head''] 
  [Text] For the first time in the almost 260-year history of 
the RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) eight of its institutes in 
December announced their intention to cease work if they do not 
receive dependable state funding. It is true that for the time 
being it seems that this threat has not been carried out. At a 
conference of the RAN Presidium with the directors of the 
scientific institutions of the Moscow region, Yuriy Osipov, RAN 
president, reported that Viktor Chernomyrdin gave him the ``word 
of the prime minister'': in the very near future the Academy 
will be paid the 24 billion rubles which are due it. It is true 
that the Academy president shared with a SEGODNYA correspondent 
serious doubts that the money in actuality would be forthcoming. 
  In the budget for the fourth quarter it was provided that 
the 
RAN be allocated the sum of 36 billion. But the scientists have 
received only 12 billion. And such a situation cannot be called 
chance because it has already been repeated several times. As is 
emphasized by presidium members, even if all the promised money 
is paid, it is nevertheless inadequate. That minimum of the sums 
which science will receive from the state budget goes 
exclusively for salaries of specialists and payment for communal 
services. Scientists are simply beginning to forget about the 
purchase of instruments, materials and reagents. 
  Moreover, in the draft budget for 1994 there is no item for 
funding the RAN as an independent organization, as has been the 
recent practice. An individual line in the budget enabled 
scientists independently to distribute the scanty allocations in 
accordance with their own needs and considerations. The 
present-day draft ``means the virtual abolition of the RAN,'' 
assert its leaders. 
  Not having received money for the fourth quarter, the 
leadership of the Academy lost patience. The RAN has now already 
long waged ``trench warfare'' with the Ministry of Science and 
Technical Policy, which implements state scientific policy and 
handles the ``science money'' passing through its hands. Indeed, 
one of the principles of the strategy of the Ministry of Science 
is the concentration of financial resources in the most priority 
fields and the organization of federal scientific centers, as 
follows from this, in which this money will be concentrated. 
  Now the RAN Presidium has decided to speak out openly 
against 
the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. ``The RAN 
Presidium regards the prevailing state of affairs not to be the 
result of the random course of circumstances but a manifestation 
of systematic work on abolition of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences,'' it states in its resolution. ``If the prevailing 
state of affairs is not rectified in the very immediate future 
the RAN presidium in the name of rescuing Russian science will 
be forced to take an extreme step -- publicly expressing its 
lack of confidence in the Minister of Science and Technical 
Policy and the Minister of Finance, whose actions in essence are 
directed to the destruction of the RAN and national science.'' 
  Even now the leadership of the Academy has decided to ask 
the 
president and prime minister of Russia to establish a State 
Council for Science, Scientific-Technical Progress and Education 
under the president of the Russian Federation as a higher 
consultative agency for working out a strategy for a state 
scientific and scientific-technical policy. It is recommended 
that the council ``be made up from among outstanding scientists 
having the recognition of the international scientific 
community,'' evidently having in mind members of the Academy. 
Moreover, the RAN presidium considers it desirable ``to 
transform the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy into a 
State Committee for Science and Technology,'' substantially 
abridging its functions, and keeping under its oversight only 
``matters relating to organization, structuring and oversight 
over implementation of state scientific-technical programs.'' 
  It is difficult to say how the officially declared war of 
the 
two science families will end. Its outcome will depend to a 
great extent on the personal disposition of the higher 
leadership of the country. For the time being it resembles a 
``pendulum,'' swinging first in one direction, and then in the 
other. 
  Meanwhile, as strong worlds quarrel one with the other, a 
great many so- called academies are appearing, specializing in 
all possible branches, and ever-wider spreading their wings. 
Organized as independent structures, they now are more and more 
frequently having success in wrangling budgeted money from the 
state. Just what are these academies? As a example it is 
possible to cite an excerpt from the unusual publicity 
prospectus of the MIA (International Academy of Information 
Science), recently promoting a forum on information science: 
``The enterprises, organizations, institutions and private 
individuals participating in conducting of the forum for a 
sponsor's fee in the amount of 300 thousand rubles are elected 
without competition to regular membership in the MAI and the 
director is elected as an honorary member of the Academy.''

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Kuchin, senior scientific specialist, High </F>
Energy Physics Institute: ``The Fate of Science -- In the Hands 
of Politicians''; the first three paragraphs are an introduction] 
  [Text] Now we all are involuntary witnesses of the ruinous 
consequences of a breakdown in businesslike cooperation in the 
economy. Politicians already are beginning to correct the twists 
and turns which have occurred during sovereignization of the 
production sphere, to seek out the ``extremists,'' those who 
first said ``no'' to a partner and began to build a wall around 
their own territory. Meanwhile in science (yes, and probably 
not only in science) the cessation of normal relations among 
work partners is continuing to be aggravated. It is not what 
scientists want, but seemingly is occurring by itself by reason 
of some objective factors. Evidently in the last analysis the 
same strong factors are operative here as in the economy. And 
the consequences of this quiet process of calamitous 
self-isolation may be not less destructive for the growth of 
scientific potential in the republic and the development of the 
country as a whole. Accordingly, it is important as quickly as 
possible to stop the general disintegration of the intellectual 
sphere of activity before its results become irreversible for 
us. When Kazakhstan was part of the Union our science was 
included in the common information pool of the country. The 
central scientific library of the republic Academy in a 
centralized system received from Moscow the books and journals 
published in the USSR and abroad. Now the operation of this 
system does not extend to us. They explain to us: there are no 
funds available. In one way or another the flow of scientific 
information to the republic has been cut off. We have been left 
without a number of international journals in the English 
language in the fields of mathematics, physics and other 
disciplines. Our director then declared: ``Seek out partners, 
establish contacts with the necessary authors, ask that they 
send reprints and preprints. You certainly understand that 
without information we cannot survive! However, money also is 
needed for maintaining contacts with the respective parties... 
The other day our institute was visited by a group of Chinese 
scientists. It was headed by Chou Huan Chao, president of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. This was not the first visit of 
Chinese colleagues to our institute. Already six years ago 
applications were finalized for carrying out joint research in 
different fields of high-energy physics and plans were laid for 
carrying out joint balloon experiments in the stratosphere. The 
negotiations ended without results: neither country had the 
necessary funding and equipment. Nevertheless Kazakh and 
Chinese physicists found a basis for carrying out joint research 
-- in third countries. Our scientists and specialists in four 
major scientific institutions in China (at Beijing, Shanghai, 
Wuhan, and Linfen) and the scientists of other countries with 
the support of Moscow colleagues are entering into a major 
international collaboration (cooperation sphere), are studying 
the interaction among different nuclei and photoemulsion nuclei 
in a broad energy range. A number of interesting results were 
obtained and 14 joint studies were published. But Kazakh and 
Chinese physicists cannot meet and talk in a neighborly way. To 
be more precise, we cannot. The tenth meeting of participants in 
this collaboration was held in September 1991 in Wuhan. The 
scientists of our institute also received an invitation. But 
they did not go: there was no money for missions abroad. This 
time invitations to China and proposals for cooperation no 
longer followed. But, indeed, at the meeting there was 
discussion of the difficult times that had arrived for 
fundamental research in some countries... So an outright 
disgraceful situation has arisen for an independent country: in 
order to meet with a work colleague who lives right here, not 
far away, ``over the mountain,'' it is necessary to go to Moscow 
or await an invitation from Sweden, where the collaboration 
center is located at Lund. It goes without saying, if the trip 
is at the expense of the inviting party... And this is not the 
sole example when the friendly hand of support extended from 
abroad is not being met with a return handshake on our part. For 
a long time our institute cooperated with the Physics Institute 
at Lodz University (Poland). Joint research was carried out, 
there was an exchange of work results and scientists and plans 
for the future were laid. In 1991 the Poles proposed that in the 
spring of the coming year a small working conference be held on 
``Simulation, Theory and Experimentation in Cosmic Rays'' at 
Almaty. And it also was planned that this conference later 
become traditional, that it acquire a solid international status 
and that different countries participate. But again everything 
was cut off due to the lack of money; the Academy at that time 
(in 1992) did not have 30 thousand rubles for meeting the 
minimum expenditures on the reception of guests. It was 
evidently difficult for the Poles to believe this. They broke 
contacts with us and the traditional protocol on cooperation was 
not extended. In actuality, what sense does it make to maintain 
relations with such an incapacitated partner! In search for a 
solution they say, seek sponsors, involve yourself in commercial 
activity, organize joint enterprises and companies, and continue 
scientific work. They cite the example of Japan, where reliance 
is on practical research carried out by large private companies, 
or China, where scientists are put on a self-supporting basis. 
We regard such a recommendation to be fallacious at its very 
core. And it is strange to hear it from time to time from the 
``generals'' of science. At best it is suited for solution of 
the problems of a limited number of individuals, but not science 
in general. The fact is that for the time being in the 
republic there are simply no such large industrial companies 
which would be in a position to assume a considerable fraction 
of responsibility for the growth of scientific research and the 
development of new technologies. Our private entrepreneurial 
sector only now is beginning to stand on its own legs and is 
absorbed in its own problems of survival and initial 
accumulation of resources. It is not up to sponsorship at such a 
scale as would be necessary for the normal functioning of 
science. For the time being the government remains the sole 
``sponsor'' for science, culture, education, medicine, etc. 
The market for individual entrepreneurship in our country is 
extremely limited and specific. It cannot be accepted by all who 
do not wish to switch suddenly from the good life to trading in 
computers or selling beverages in the streets. Incidentally, for 
those not in the know, the heads of the researcher and creative 
worker are not at all tuned like those of a merchant or broker. 
Accordingly, to combine business, science and art is difficult 
for a normal person with a psyche not operating on two 
frequencies. And finally, and most importantly: perhaps it is 
not evident that all this feverish individual activity of 
scientific workers in the search for sponsors, grants and money 
for acquiring computers and equipment, trips abroad and return 
reception of visitors has a single result: rapid breakdown of 
scientific potential. The same as the departure of people for 
commercial organizations or the ``brain drain'' abroad. And this 
potential, indeed, has been built up in Kazakhstan over the 
decades and constitutes a treasure of the republic. And it is of 
great importance for the movement of people along a civilized 
development path. Will we select backwardness? The tragic 
situation in which Kazakh science has found itself, it is 
believed, is caused not so much by the general economic crisis, 
which in itself is secondary, as by the mentality of the 
influential part of society, a systematic undervaluation of that 
role which science plays in our time, in general, for the 
intellectual potential of the country, for the growth of the 
well-being of people and the prospects for its further 
development. With respect to the number of people involved in 
intellectual spheres of activity, with respect to the importance 
for the future development (or degradation) of society, the 
problem of the fate of science in Kazakhstan is now already 
acquiring a political ring. Like litmus paper, giving evidence 
of the course of a reaction in one direction or another, the 
prolonged neglecting of science indicates a voluntary (or 
involuntary) choice of a definite variant of the development of 
events: a choice in the direction of backwardness. In 
actuality, when Japan after bitter damage in the Second World 
War went to work on restoration of its economy it also 
experienced an acute need for money and received material 
assistance from the outside. And nevertheless it proceeded to a 
sharp increase in expenditures on fundamental research and 
development work. During 1948-1949 36.7% of the budget was 
allocated for these purposes. Because its leadership elected a 
path of development by increasing the intellectual capabilities 
of the population and on this basis the mass use of advanced 
foreign methods and equipment. There's an example of 
resoluteness and faith in their own capabilities! Against the 
background of Japan and other countries attaining rapid progress 
due to an intensification of the intellectual sphere of 
activity, the slow ``financial'' stifling of science in 
Kazakhstan is perceived as a sort of act of national suicide. 
Again and again I want to ask our powers that be: ``Do you 
need science? If not, it is interesting to know how, relying on 
what social forces, you intend to ensure the proclaimed 
strategic development of the republic, the flourishing of the 
people and growth of its prestige in the world?'' In order to 
accelerate democratic and market transformations in society 
there must be profound changes in the consciousness of the 
people, a radical breaking away from the stereotypes and 
mentality which have developed. With the present-day 
psychological mood of society it is difficult for scientists to 
count on any full recognition of the usefulness of their 
activity and receive everything which is necessary for carrying 
it out at a fitting professional level. It seems that in 
Kazakhstan there is a need for a union of science and politics.

<F P=106> [Interview between Raisa Dobraya, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F>
correspondent, and Kupzhasar Naribayev, rector, Kazakh State 
University; ``We Will Not Erect a Tombstone Over Science''; the 
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] It is known that the situation of our science, 
expressing it gently, is not easy. A high percentage of young 
people have been drawn into the business world. A hundred times 
more money can be earned in deals, in buying and selling, than 
behind the desk at any, even the most important scientific 
research institute. After graduating from lower schools, 
preference is given to the economics, law and commerce faculties 
and to universities. What is being done in order to enhance the 
image of the so-called nonprestige science faculties, such as is 
the situation for education in general in our country, and is 
there still a pull of young people toward science, despite its 
present day status? These matters are discussed by Kupzhasar 
Naribayev, rector of the Kazakh State University imeni Al-Farabi. 
  Naribayev: I cannot speak for the entire 
educational system. We now have a good many higher educational 
institutions, including private ones. But our university, the 
oldest in the republic, is intended for training specialists in 
the fundamental sciences, and without question there are 
difficulties. Although I assume that we somehow like to paint a 
dark picture and, incidentally, constantly lay it on thick. Now 
is a complex period, but I figure that a solution will be found 
in one way or another. I think it would be incorrect to say, for 
example, that we are erecting a tombstone over science, on which 
the very development of society is dependent. In the most 
difficult time a Ministry of Science was organized, which, 
incidentally, does not fund groups, as was the case earlier, but 
scientific projects. But many scientific organizations have been 
accustomed to being funded in advance and at the present time 
they are left confused. We, however, have received about 1.5 
billion rubles, demonstrating the timeliness of the themes which 
we have proposed. 
  It is difficult for science and the education system, but it 
is indeed clear: that country wins out which devotes attention 
primarily to them. If we, let's assume, purchase technology in 
the West, it must be adapted to our conditions. Who will do 
this? Yes, scientists are going into business and students are 
engaging in it. The budget is weak. Businessmen produce nothing. 
It is necessary to have a system of laws which will favor the 
development of goods production and then specialists also will 
be needed. 
  This time, I am sure, will come. The state, recognizing the 
problems involved in our own development, must determine the 
special role of science and education even against the 
background of deep social and economic difficulties and do 
everything for their thorough development. 
  Dobraya: Kupzhasar Naribayev, and what now is the 
flow of those entering the science faculties: physics, 
philosophy, chemistry? 
  Naribayev: It seems that it's not that small, the 
true devotees of science have not been diverted. Yes, and to 
call these faculties nonprestigious due to the fact that there 
is a not very high competition for entrance would be incorrect. 
After all, today there are many who are simply materially unable 
to allow themselves travel for study in the capital and because 
of this the flow of those matriculating in the higher 
educational institutions in Almaty has been reduced. It is 
precisely the university graduates who must develop and further 
improve new highly scientific technologies in different branches 
of physics, chemistry and biology and their knowledge is the 
basis for the further development of nuclear power, 
environmental protection and the development of new materials. 
And this sort of activity cannot be called nonprestige. 
  As the economic situation stabilizes it also will be natural 
to expect an increase in the motivation for study in the natural 
science faculties. The formation of such a long-term motivation 
requires a definite period of time. 
  Dobraya: What is the percentage of foreign 
students who are selecting the university? 
  Nabirayev: A total of 257 persons from 29 
countries of the world, which is 1.8% of the total number. 
  Dobraya: Are they coming from America and Europe? 
  Nabirayev: Yes, there are students from America, 
Germany and Poland. Our education is recognized in the West. 
  Dobraya: But it is assumed that this is not the 
case. Is it not true that our diplomas are not valued there? 
  Nabirayev: It is impossible to make such a 
categorical assertion that our diplomas are not valued in the 
West. This problem has its juridical aspect. In world practice 
there are agreements in force among countries on the reciprocal 
recognition of certificates of education. The former all-union 
model of education, having primarily an ideological character, 
naturally could not be a partner of the Western system for the 
training of personnel. Indeed, in actual practice there have 
been no forms of cooperation with the West in the field of 
training of personnel that would make it possible to speak of 
any discrimination against our diplomas. In individual branches, 
such as in economics, there could be no such cooperation. But 
nevertheless the quality of training of specialists, especially 
in the natural science fields of specialization, in our country 
always was and still is at a sufficiently high level for it to 
be recognized in both Europe and America. Here we have the 
example of numerous cases of successful cooperation between our 
scientists and those in the West in different fields of science 
and technology. Our graduate students and young scientists are 
successfully working in research centers in America and Europe. 
  However, the radical transformations now transpiring in the 
education sphere in our country have the tendency toward 
organization of an educational system more adapted to world 
standards. Since 1992 our university has switched to a two-level 
teaching system such as adopted in many countries. And beginning 
with the current academic year this system has been introduced 
in a number of other universities of the republic. Such a 
changeover was not at all dictated by any striving to imitate 
the Western instructional system. It must be noted that in world 
practice a high evaluation was given to the former Soviet 
education system based on 5-6 years of instruction. But from the 
point of view of the feasibility of the expenditures on such an 
intensive training of specialists, most of whose knowledge then 
remains unused, it is preferable, to be sure, to have a 
multilevel structure of education. 
  The striving for an increase in the quality of education 
induced us to study the experience of academic institutions in 
many countries in the field of monitoring and evaluating the 
knowledge of students. The rating system for checking the 
knowledge of students introduced in our university incorporated 
the most effective and optimum approaches to the certification 
of students and is combined to the maximum with the multilevel 
training of specialists. 
  We are inviting the cooperation of Western specialists in 
the 
market economy and international law fields in the training of 
our people. Agreements have been concluded on cooperation in the 
field of training of personnel with universities in France, 
Japan, Great Britain, South Korea and Turkey and for the second 
year joint work is being done with the World Bank in Washington 
on the retraining of our instructors in the principles of a 
market economy. All these measures, it is believed, will 
facilitate an increase in the quality of instruction in our 
university. 
  Dobraya: Is there a plan for work with the gifted? 
  Naribayev: There is. Our instructors are 
participating in olympiads, such students are assigned to 
assistant and full professors, are carrying out individual types 
of departmental work and are being sent abroad for study. But, 
unfortunately, only those can remain as graduate students who 
have material resources: a very small stipend. And I also wish 
to add that there are few applications for specialists to enter 
from scientific research organizations. On the one hand, to be 
sure, they themselves are not in the best situation: they are 
being cut back and are poorly funded, etc., but in science there 
always is a need, so to speak, for a new infusion, and then it 
will develop. This is one of the reasons why our students, even 
talented ones, are going into the business world. A sign of the 
times, but we will hope that it is temporary. 
  Dobraya: University science earlier was regarded 
as a pariah. It was assumed that fundamental science was being 
developed only inside the walls of scientific research 
institutes. What's the present-day situation? 
  Naribayev: Fundamental science is developing in 
the Academy of Sciences and in our university. We have large 
laboratories and three scientific research institutes have 
opened: theoretical and experimental physics, new chemical 
technologies and modern problems in biology. A scientific 
research humanities center is in operation. We intend to open 
institutes of applied mathematics and ecology. But there is a 
very difficult problem: science and production are not working 
hand-in-hand and for the time being tests are being carried out 
nowhere in the country. Once again it remains to hope that these 
are temporary difficulties. Just take a look, the realities of 
today are unquestionably imposing an imprint on the educational 
process. One would think that against the background of a 
decline in the prestige of education it would be natural to 
expect a decrease in the general intellectual level of the 
student body. But each year we are meeting at the university 
threshold young people desiring to study Persian and Japanese 
literature, the history of the Far East, space physics, the 
theory of numbers, genetics and molecular biology. Precisely 
these young people constitute an enormous intellectual potential 
for our country. Without such young people we cannot construct 
in our republic that which we want to build. A tombstone must 
not be erected over science.

<F P=106> [Interview between Boris Saltykov, Minister of Science and </F>
Technical Policy RF, and Olga Kolesova: ``The Winter of Our 
Science''; the first two paragraphs are an introduction] 
  [Text] It is cold in the unheated offices of Academy 
institutes in Siberia. There also is cold in the hearts of 
scientific specialists forever awaiting budget reductions or a 
simple cutback. The most warmth-loving long ago were drawn to 
the south, but more likely to the west... 
  Our correspondent took advantage of a visit of Boris 
Saltykov, Minister of Science and Technical Policy of the 
Russian Federation, to Novosibirsk, to inquire when there might 
be a thaw for science. 
  Kolesova: Boris Georgiyevich, two years in the 
ministerial seat these days is not a short time. So many changes 
have occurred that each year one can count on three, and maybe 
even ten. Have you had a change in your points of view on the 
goals and methods for the reformation of science? 
  Saltykov: There has been a definite evolution in 
points of view, I think, among all members of the government and 
among all the citizens of Russia. We began reforms in 1991 
without having had any practical experience in carrying them out 
and therefore there was a definite idealism, purely theoretical 
ideas of what had to be done. 
  On the whole the strategic ideas on the principal goals of 
science reform have almost not changed. However, the forms, the 
methods and the sequence of different measures had to be changed 
as we went along, taking the developing economic and social 
conditions into account. It was immediately clear to us: the 
model of science which had been adapted to the 
administrative-command control system inevitably had to be 
changed because by that time the system had already changed. By 
late 1991 all the branch ministries had collapsed and this means 
that all the branch science which they fed had already come 
apart at the seams. It was necessary to construct new 
mechanisms, to devise new structures for its funding and control. 
  The idealism was manifested in the fact that we clearly had 
underrated the stability of the old system, its capacity to 
resist. When reforms began in the economy science (however, like 
culture as well) suffered more than other branches. This was not 
the fault of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, but 
its misfortune. A substantially lesser growth of prices was 
predicted for early 1992. We anticipated that in 1992 the budget 
would be reduced by 40-50%, but the results for the year 
showed 
that it had fallen by almost a factor of three. This was a shock 
for science. And our role under these shock conditions was to 
react rapidly, to devise survival mechanisms. In short, whereas 
initially the first priority was to bring the system for 
organizing and funding science into line with the conditions of 
the expanding market, by the spring of 1992 the problem of 
elementary survival had already arisen. And it was important 
(this, incidentally, was the most difficult task) to save the 
best, sacrificing -- if necessity dictated -- that whose loss 
would not exert too great an influence on the scientific 
capabilities of the country. To be sure, the principal 
difficulties arose in the choice of priorities due to the 
enormous inertia of the former system. Let's say that we 
inherited about 40 scientific-technical programs -- strongly 
validated, organizationally formulated, but in many respects no 
longer corresponding to the needs of 1992, much less 1993. It 
was very difficult to change them. A start was made by replacing 
several program directors. 
  In general I would say as follows: life constantly teaches 
its lessons. The changes which occurred dictated that we take 
new approaches. For example, the implementation of the program 
for state scientific centers in early 1992 was planned in a 
different form. But the crisis in branch science already by late 
1992 forced a search for new forms of immediate assistance to 
the best scientific and technical organizations in Russia. 
  And evolution of points of view of the type: we thought, it 
is necessary to go to the market, but now we understood that it 
was necessary to leave everything as it was, something which, 
Thank God, did not occur. In general, however, the process of 
acquiring work experience under conditions which were unusual 
for us turned out to be not very easy. And this experience, 
especially for high-level directors, in my opinion, was 
invaluable. 
  Kolesova: ``There is too much science in our 
country'' -- that is a contention with which everyone 
mercilessly scolds you -- from academician to common folk. Do 
you by chance not intend to refute it? 
  Saltykov: This thesis in actuality was advanced by 
me early in 1992, but it was employed in a definite context. 
There was probably as much science as was required by that 
system which existed several years ago: a system which was 
ideologized, militarized, oriented on the needs of a great 
military power. But we changed the system: we decided that it 
was necessary to cut the army in half, to reduce unnecessary 
expenditures on defense because precisely they stifled the 
civilian branch (we had five times more tanks than did the 
United States!). Accordingly, in our country there came to be 
many who were employed in the research, development, testing and 
engineering fields, especially those who were related to defense 
orders. This does not at all mean that we have too many educated 
or too many talented people (and sometimes it is precisely so 
interpreted to me). But it is just the other way around: the 
more educated and talented people there are in society, the 
better. But, after all, scientific specialists and engineers are 
not simply educated people, but people producing some product 
which must be required by society. Either fundamental knowledge 
is involved, or practical development work, oriented on 
industry, defense, etc. Specialists at any scientific research 
institute know very well that each institute has been 
supersaturated with people -- in the distant golden 1960's when 
petroleum dollars flowed in a river and virtually everything 
which was applied for was funded. To be sure, I exaggerate, but 
not by much. 
  A civilian society, in which the interests of all layers of 
society are balanced, must count its resources and also must 
count its expenditures on science. All the time they say about 
me: ``He wants to cut back on fundamental science.'' However, 
even fundamental science has its funding sources. It is known 
that even the Academy has received 30-40% of its funding 
from 
defense orders. And if we all are in agreement that expenditures 
on defense must be reduced, it is inevitable that the Academy 
will be allocated 30-40% less. Or that this percentage 
must be 
taken from another part of the budget. But from what part? At 
whose expense? 
  Incidentally, one of the results of activity of the Soros 
Fund was the appearance of interesting statistics. It was found 
that from almost a million ``statistical'' scientific workers in 
Russia during the last five years only 21 thousand have three 
(or more) publications in prestigious scientific journals, ours 
and foreign. Well, let's assume that an equal number simply did 
not submit applications. And, unfortunately, this is a quite 
objective evaluation of those really ``producing'' new knowledge 
in fundamental science! Our drama was that in our country there 
was a very labor-intensive (in contrast to fund-intensive) 
development path, including in science as well. Whereas, for 
example, in Europe, United States and Japan one scientist and 
corresponding equipment are adequate for performing any work, 
this would take us three researchers and five technicians. That 
is, we have made up for the shortage of modern equipment by 
work, sometimes even work by highly skilled specialists. 
Accordingly, in the event of a changeover to advanced research 
technologies reserves will be found for reducing numbers. On the 
other hand, these people could successfully find themselves in 
such organizations necessary for a market economy as those 
introducing new technologies, consulting and servicing firms, 
certification and information centers, etc. In the technically 
well-developed countries this infrastructure is extremely well 
developed and a great number of specialists are employed in it. 
  Kolesova: Many provincial scientists, including 
those in Siberia, have suspected: the minister -- in any case at 
the beginning of his activity -- held the opinion that all 
science was concentrated within the limits of the Sadovoye Ring. 
  Saltykov: Just plain slander. I always criticized 
the organization of our science precisely for the fact that in 
the administrative system all decisions were made at the center. 
And certainly in this sense Moscow made mistakes in the 
distribution of resources. Accordingly, I am speaking out 
precisely for the maximum decentralization of the making of 
decisions, in particular, with respect to the allocation of 
funding. 
  But when they tell me that it is necessary to elect 
scientists to the Academy of Sciences not only from Moscow, but 
from each provincial city because ``there are no academicians 
there,'' I protest. Despite this, members must be elected on the 
basis of the results of their work, not by place of residence. 
  Kolesova: Could you not formulate the key points 
in the present-day scientific policy of the government, since 
sometimes the fear arises that there simply is none... 
  Saltykov: There is a concept, and it is not the 
result of office meditations of ministerial officials. It was 
formulated together with the leading scientists of the country 
and was discussed at the All- Russian Conference of Scientific 
Workers and in the government. In the concept which is today 
being implemented there are two main goals: creation of new 
mechanisms for organizing and funding of science corresponding 
to a market economy and conservation of the capabilities 
accumulated over the course of the entire evolution of Russian 
science. Among the methods for implementing these goals it is 
necessary to mention the creation of alternative 
extradepartmental funding sources. This funding system is 
primarily governmental. One fund, for fundamental research, has 
already been established; we are striving to set up a second for 
research in the humanities. We also are approving the setting up 
of regional funds. Incidentally, a good example is in Siberia: 
the Krasnoyarsk Regional Science Support Fund. 
  With respect to applied science, there, as it seems to us 
today, two processes should be at work. First, transformation of 
some of the former branch institutes by means of organization of 
joint stock companies, privatization and merging with some 
production structures into companies heavily oriented on 
science, large or small, which will live, as they say, ``from 
the market,'' filling orders of consumers, among which the state 
may be one. However, the institutes most important for the state 
itself and for the time being (or in principle) not intended for 
the market consumer are being transformed into state scientific 
centers and are receiving considerable support from the budget, 
although, to be sure, a search for clients is not forbidden them. 
  If one speaks of the entire innovative sphere, we will 
assume 
that it is necessary to develop small-scale innovative business. 
We allocated an item in the budget for the funding of business 
insurance policies and business motor pools, the ``incubators of 
business,'' but for the time being there are no good mechanisms 
for such support. 
  Still another of the principal points in our scientific 
policy: a system for selecting priorities and funding in 
priority directions, finalized, primarily, in the form of state 
scientific and technical programs. This will make it possible to 
fund important research within the framework of fundamental 
programs having good coordinating structures: ``High-Energy 
Physics,'' ``Human Genome,'' ``New Methods in Bioengineering,'' 
etc. 
  Another part is programs oriented on use in the economy. 
Here, for the time being there are difficulties because it is 
unclear how under market economy conditions it is possible to 
distribute the rights of ownership for the results obtained 
during work under a government program. 
  Finally, in the present-day difficult situation an acute 
problem, as before, is the brain drain and ways to contend with 
it. The ``Government Professor'' project already has been in 
preparation for a year. The essence of this project is the 
payment of the elite part of our scientists such sums as would 
enable them not to think of departure for abroad. 
  Kolesova: Insofar as I understand, this idea found 
its reflection, highly distorted, to be sure, in a recent 
presidential decree entitled ``Material Support of Scientists.'' 
Under the circumstances of adoption of this decree, once again 
there is evidently a manifestation of the disagreement between 
your ministry and the Presidium of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, already becoming traditional, which in no way 
strengthens the position of scientists in society and the 
government... 
  Saltykov: We worked on the ``Government 
Professor'' draft together, both the Academy and the Ministry. A 
working group was organized in the Ministry of Science and 
Technical Policy which included representatives of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, universities and government agencies and 
these were the authors of this project. And we thought out the 
details: selection method and organization of expert councils 
which would include foreign scientists. But it turned out that 
the preparation of the decree on ``Material Support of 
Scientists'' went right past us, it did not receive the OK from 
either the Minister of Science and Technical Policy or the 
Minister of Finance or the science section of the government. 
  Kolesova: Why? 
  Saltykov: Don't ask me. They simply did not 
present the draft to us. 
  The first point in this decree is seemingly a weak 
reflection 
of the ``Government Professor'' idea. But I assume that only the 
vocabulary of the project was adopted: ``outstanding 
scientists,'' ``stipends,'' etc. However, its essence has 
nothing in common with the idea of contending with the brain 
drain. First of all because there is violation of the 
extradepartmental principle. With all respect to the Academy of 
Sciences, it must be admitted that outstanding scientists are 
working in both the higher educational institutions and in the 
branches. It would be more natural to establish 
extradepartmental councils for the selection. Incidentally, this 
is not just my point of view -- after issuance of the decree 
there was immediately a rain of accusations that the 
universities and some ministries (the Ministry of Nuclear 
Energy, for example, has excellent institutes at the academic 
level) had been forgotten. 
  But the most important thing is the figures: the stipend for 
an outstanding scientist, 75 thousand rubles, to be sure, cannot 
pretend to be a realization of that idea which was embodied in 
the ``Government Professor'' project. It is something else that 
today any money is worth getting. But this is not a project for 
contending with the brain drain; this is simply still another 
stipend for some group of scientists. 
  The ``Government Professor'' project provided for a stipend 
in the amount of a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars or five 
hundred -- that can be debated -- but as you see, the scale is 
completely different. It is not a matter of a dispute between 
the ministry and the Academy, but an old fear: whether the 
remaining scientific community will be insulted by designation 
of such an elite? 
  I have dealt a great deal with the truly outstanding 
scientists of our time and they are convinced: this would not 
happen. Any proper differential treatment, for example, when a 
person sells a license and receives three million, arouses no 
envy among colleagues because they know that this money was 
earned. It is far more dreadful when in such selections of the 
elite one or two ill-chosen, inadequate persons are included. 
The entire scientific community, indeed, knows what's up, who's 
worth what. Such accidents therefore cannot be allowed. 
  But in the decree there is reference to such sums relative 
to 
which the lofty words ``material support of scientists'' are 
inappropriate. For that reason as well the decree ought not have 
been issued; a directive of the government would have been 
entirely sufficient. Because scientists, to be sure, expected 
major decisions. 
  Kolesova: Both during your visit to Novosibirsk 
last year and today you spoke of the complex situation in the 
government arising due to the strong pressure of some branches. 
Did you make any attempts at organizing a strong science lobby? 
  Saltykov: Lobbying is not exclusively something 
Russian, it is observed in all countries. If one speaks of the 
relation of forces in the past parliament, there was a strong 
agrarian lobby there, and it also exists in the government. The 
organization of something similar for science is possible 
through an adequate makeup of the State Duma, which need not 
necessarily include scientists, but in any case intelligent 
people understanding the role of science in the fate of Russia 
and who understand clearly that expenditures on science must not 
drop below a certain level. 
  Kolesova: Insofar as I know, you are running from 
Novosibirsk Oblast in the ``Russian Election.'' In this 
connection I ask the standard ``Bolshevik'' question: a minimum 
program or a maximum program? 
  Saltykov: I have already set forth a maximum 
program: to realize an increase in the fraction of the budget 
for science in the coming year. The minimum program is to hold 
at the same level. But I nevertheless will strive to achieve the 
maximum program because this is an entirely realistic 
parliamentary struggle. Excuse me for an entirely Bolshevik 
answer: if the ``Russian Election'' turns out successfully we 
will do everything in order to augment appropriations for 
science. 
  Kolesova: Pardon me, but here's the traditional 
challenge in the ``Russian Election,'' especially for candidate 
ministers: you already have been in authority but expenditures 
on science have in no way increased. 
  Saltykov: That is in error. We were in authority 
only in 1992 and in 1993 the government became a coalition. I 
don't have to tell you that the authority was in the hands of 
the Supreme Soviet, not ours. A struggle of opinions developed, 
alas, not to the advantage of science, although I also must bear 
my share of responsibility. And nevertheless our principal task 
now is to achieve an increase in the fraction of expenditures on 
science in the Russian budget. 
  Kolesova: The last, purely personal question: are 
you not weary of all this? 
  Saltykov: Fatigued, but also hardened.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Kosarev and Lyudmila Lesnova: ``Russian </F>
Science Aid Falls Short''; the first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] A commentary on review materials devoted to the 
matter of survival of science in the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, what is now the CIS, appeared under the indicated 
heading in the journal SCIENCE (September 1993). 
  In familiarizing readers with its content, we will allow 
ourselves some comments in passing. After the breakup of the 
Union, as the situation in Russia became more acute, the West 
was faced with the threat of a catastrophe associated with the 
brain drain, and with it also new technologies in the field of 
the means of mass annihilation. Even more than in the past there 
was a strengthened fear of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
especially their appearance in countries with an unpredictable 
policy. This circumstance aroused Western analysts to concern 
themselves with work on the matter of aid to Russian scientists. 
  The pursued objective was not only to retain control over 
nuclear weapons, but also to take advantage for themselves of 
the rich scientific potential of Russian scientists, attracting 
them to joint development work by extending financial support 
along the lines of both international funds and national 
corporations, funds and societies having adequate financial and 
scientific resources. 
  A concise prehistory of this is as follows. James Baker, the 
former American Secretary of State, in September 1992 conveyed 
to B. N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, the 
information that the United States was ready to make its 
contribution to the saving of Russian science. He promised to 
seek $25 million for these purposes which it was proposed be 
distributed among scientists engaged in the military field. This 
initiative received official support in Russia. Subsequently the 
European Community joined this initiative, promising to allocate 
an additional $19 million. In turn, Japan obligated itself to 
add $17 million for this very same purpose. 
  George Bush, president of the United States, assumed that in 
cooperative work it would be possible to maintain the scientific 
capabilities of Russia. He laid great hopes on the International 
Science and Technology Center, which was to award its first 
grant not later than May 1992. Sixteen months have elapsed, but 
this international center has not allocated a single penny for 
these purposes. 
  The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation in every way 
possible has held onto the possibility of such cooperation. Both 
the supporters and opponents of this idea in its ranks have 
become very active. The first have striven not to lose their 
positions in the field of the fundamental sciences where our 
scientists have been traditionally strong. The second have found 
such an alliance to be humiliating, on the one hand, and on the 
other hand they have expressed the fear that such a policy will 
favor the leakage of secret information. 
  However, each of the well-developed countries has sought to 
extract the maximum advantage for itself and has been in no 
hurry to allocate money to the Russians. Negotiations at the top 
frequently end with assurances of readiness for cooperation, but 
the times for allocating sums are constantly violated. The 
selectivity of interests also has exerted an influence. For 
example, the Americans have been primarily attracted by space 
research. They have promised Russia that $100 million will be 
released for use on the Mir space station and the right to 
conclude contracts for the launch of commercial satellites. 
However, our country has received only $34 million of the $250 
million promised through all channels. 
  Long months have passed on different kinds of agreements and 
understandings. As a result, the process of implementing the 
project has assumed a drawn-out character, has begun to develop 
on a noncentralized basis (it always was centralized in the 
former USSR when the agreeing side was either the CPSU Central 
Committee or the USSR Academy of Sciences and different 
ministries), e.g. through individual private funds. One of the 
first who succeeded in overcoming the bureaucracy was the 
billionaire G. Soros, who set aside $100 million for Russian 
science. But it was found that just money was not enough. It was 
first necessary to establish a banking and accounting system, a 
control system, a system for expert evaluation of projects and 
purposeful selection of organizations and specific individuals 
whose activity would command the respect of American specialists 
and appeal to their interests. 
  Months also were spent on this and meanwhile a considerable 
percentage of the promising scientists had already emigrated 
from Russia. Just at the Nuclear Research Institute imeni 
Kurchatov 20 of the 54 scientists of the Plasma Theory Section 
have departed for the West, and as far as can be determined, 
they have no intention of returning. Scientists are unsettled 
with respect to their status as researchers and their material 
rewards. 
  Some foreign funds would like to avoid high taxes in their 
own countries and therefore are not adverse to investing sums 
for beneficial purposes, such as the subsidization of Russian 
science. However, it is not so easy to accomplish this. In the 
Russian Federation private individuals do not have the right to 
receive hard currency from abroad. 
  No one is fully confident that the allocated sums will reach 
the intended recipients because they pass through several 
bureaucratic levels (customs, bank, institution where the 
specialist works). It is not always possible to set up the base 
necessary for research in place. Sending the money on is 
complicated by high taxes. 
  The Americans have become convinced that the Russian side is 
misusing the aid sent. For example, Russian individuals in many 
cases travel to the United States who have nothing to do with 
those programs for which the sums were allocated. This 
circumstance prompted our American colleagues to put this work 
under their control. In December 1992 the Russian Federation was 
visited by a group of scientists from the United States for 
on-the-spot familiarization with the most promising scientific 
centers. Without special difficulty they determined 22 research 
groups meriting special attention, 21 of which were immediately 
included in a plan for the funding of scientific work. A grant 
in the sum of $5,000 annually was set aside for the scientists 
of each group and one scientific association received $30,000 
from the Human Genome fund. The money will be sent directly to 
those doing the work. 
  Plans call for increasing the number of grants, the amount 
of 
which varies from $10 to $100 thousand, under two-year 
scientific programs. Difficulties arise with respect to expert 
evaluation of the applications submitted for receiving such 
grants. Plans call for involving the leading scientists of the 
United States, Western Europe and Japan in this work. 
Cooperation with Western colleagues in the science field is not 
limited solely to funding. It is not less important to exchange 
scientific information [publications, holding of scientific 
conferences and such. In this connection the authors of 
publications mention the slowness in the finalization of exit 
visas, which results in the disruption of foreign missions of 
Russian scientists.] 
  The table accompanying this article, published in the 
mentioned journal, is of interest. We duplicate it in full.

  The cited data show that as of today only the George Soros 
Fund has actively entered into cooperation with scientists of 
the Russian Federation. The others are either in the 
organizational phase or have already depleted their resources. 
Those organizations which do not publicize their intentions but 
make a contribution to supporting the development of Russian 
science arouse a definite sympathy. 
  A long procedure is involved in receiving grants. And this 
is 
entirely to be expected. In the West they are not accustomed to 
throwing money to the winds. For us it was typical to receive 
subsidies from the state and not always was attention given to 
the results of our own research. In many cases the subsidies 
were used by science and education officials to make trips to 
different countries, where at government expense they satisfied 
their personal curiosity and also pursued more mercantile 
objectives. Unfortunately, this also is no rarity today. The 
birthmarks of socialism do not go away rapidly. 
  And so it goes that foreign colleagues invite you to 
international congresses, you try to formalize travel documents, 
but the real possibility for departure is in the hands of 
completely other people -- either ministerial workers or 
officials at institutions of higher education who have 
accomplished little in science and who are completely unknown in 
the West. It happens that a scientist is invited to work at the 
WHO and a person goes who is closer to the administrative 
circles of the Ministry of Health or a scientific research 
institute. It appears that in our system for evaluating the 
intellectual capabilities of a specialist, his social and 
juridical defensibility, we will not very soon put our house in 
order in this respect. That is why there is the fear that the 
system of grants is being used by ``go-getters.'' 
  The system of grants may possibly seem to some to be 
humiliating. But under the conditions of negligence of science, 
education and public health in our country it would be incorrect 
to ignore it. Otherwise we risk falling completely behind in our 
own development, losing traditions and priorities in science. 
Science as a part of culture is international. A scientist has a 
motherland, but science does not. Its results belong to all 
mankind.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Mikhnevich and Igor Polyakov: ``What We </F>
Have We Are Saving''; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] A plant is being constructed at Zelenograd for the 
production of modern microelectronics. Despite the fact that the 
amount of capital investment is estimated at $300 million, 
specialists are sure: this sum can be recouped with profit in 
three years. This profit will be earned due to the sale of 
products in internal and world markets. Discussions of the 
preservation and multiplication of national intellectual 
capabilities in the high technologies sphere up to now resemble 
a dialogue between a blind person and a deaf person. Cries for 
assistance come from the camp of scientists and engineers; the 
government, which has no money, utters promises and commercial 
structures, scratching their heads as where to invest 
accumulated capital, lack the foresightedness for evaluating the 
essence of high technologies and to understand: a gold mine lies 
literally beneath their feet. However sad it is to admit, but 
precisely those foreign companies working in the field of 
microelectronics (behind which, among others, stand the major 
banks) sooner than our fellow countrymen understood that it 
would be the height of stupidity to ignore the possibilities of 
an enormous scientific-technical complex in whose creation they 
would not have to invest a cent. Somewhere slightly correct 
something, somewhere renovate equipment, then race for licenses 
for products in great demand, using the Russian work force which 
is very low cost by world standards. j In essence the only thing 
which is saving us is that in the West they know very well the 
value of the high technologies, which are called 21st century 
technologies. And therefore they are interested in not allowing 
the killing of the goose that lays the golden eggs. They are not 
interested because world practice has shown loud and clear: high 
technologies give a maximum yield only under conditions of an 
international division of labor. What this separation should be 
is a matter of business strategy. And now we will return to 
the Zelenograd scientific-technical complex, which after 
becoming a joint stock company, becoming privatized, was given 
the name Kontsern Nauchnyy Tsentr [Scientific Center Concern], 
the status of a juridical entity and a heap of troubles with 
respect to its own future. One of the first who drew attention 
to the capabilities of the Zelenograd enterprises was the 
American corporation IBM, which is known as the king of the 
computer market. It supplied the equipment for the Kvant plant 
forming part of the Scientific Center and there organized the 
production of personal computers and videomonitors. As they say, 
cheap but good. The specialists of this foreign corporation took 
a very far-sighted look. They calculated in time that the 
enterprises at the Scientific Center were capable on a regular 
basis of replacing their company electronic components by 
Russian components, concluding that this in no way would exert 
an influence on computer quality. Later there was more. It was 
found that due to Zelenograd know-how it was possible to 
increase considerably the capacity of the computer external 
memory, making it suitable for use in computer networks. In the 
long run IBM intends in general to afford the Scientific Center 
the opportunity to work to the specifications of their clients, 
on the basis of Zelenograd computers creating new-generation 
information-computer control systems. Another channel for the 
Scientific Center to enter into the world market had already 
been laid out independently. Its enterprises began to supply 
integrated circuits to the markets of Southeast Asia -- again in 
conformity to the specifications of the client companies. The 
quality of the product was quickly appraised favorably there and 
today approximately a third of the production of the ``Mikron'' 
and ``Angstrem'' plants making up the concern is exported. The 
reputation of the delivered products is so high that the clients 
pay in advance. Still more interesting for the people at 
Zelenograd is the story with China -- it did not begin to 
purchase microcircuits, but the equipment produced by the 
``Elion'' plant for the production of microcircuits in order on 
its basis to establish a technological base for Chinese 
microelectronics. The unique production lines for the 
production of microcircuits cost really big bucks and therefore 
it is in general not difficult to understand the Chinese 
strategy. ``Elion'' offers its equipment considerably more 
cheaply and the price differential in no way corresponds to a 
loss in quality. The very same thing applies to the delivery of 
microcircuits to Southeast Asia. Accordingly, to think that the 
Scientific Center has become a foreign exchange millionaire for 
the time being is still premature. However, it may very easily 
become such if it is possible to broaden the production of 
microelectronics and start up the plant which is under 
construction. The time required for paying off the 300-million 
hard currency credit necessary for this purpose (taking into 
account the interest rate of 9-12% prevailing in the 
world) is 
estimated at three years. If reliance was to be oriented on the 
preferential credits within the framework of conversion programs 
just the construction of the plant alone would require six years 
and during this time there would be a changeover to the next 
generation in microelectronics. Turning to world experience of 
advanced countries, it is easy to understand: investments in 
scientific and practical development work of electronics 
companies always have been and remain a profitable business. 
And what about our commercial banks? Indeed, if you think it 
over, this is a possibility which for the time being they are 
deprived. When the shares of the Zelenograd enterprises are 
given a quote on the international money market together with 
IBM, Motorola, Sony and other companies specializing in this 
field, it will already be too late. It is not necessary to speak 
of how much the production of the Scientific Center is necessary 
in Russia and the CIS. Reference is not to computer production 
alone. It is sufficient to recall the quality of our telephonic 
communications, worse than which it is perhaps difficult to 
conceive. Accordingly, the programs of the Scientific Center 
include the modernization of the communication networks of the 
Moscow telephone center and the replacement of archaic 
electromechanical commutators by high-speed electronic 
commutators. For Moscow a project also has been developed for 
coinless automatic telephones using plastic cards. Still more 
far-going plans call for the development of a supercomputer on 
the basis of our own know-how and use of its technical solutions 
in the production of high-speed PC's in no way inferior in 
quality to similar products from IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other 
companies known throughout the world. Contact telephone:

Sciences: ``Science Serves the Ukraine''] 
  [Text] The First (Founding) General Meeting of the Academy 
of Sciences was held on 27 November 1918 at Kiev under the 
highly difficult conditions of the Civil War. This was an event 
of enormous importance for the Ukraine and its culture. With the 
appearance of the Academy the long-held dream of the progressive 
Ukrainian intelligentsia for the creation of such a scientific 
center in the Ukraine which would organize and bring together 
the creative activity of its scientists and put scientific 
advances in the service of the people was realized. 
  The activity of the Academy of Sciences began from three 
institutes, individual departments, offices, commissions, and 
committees. Only 140 specialists worked in all these 
institutions, and among them there were 12 academicians. 
  Now the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences consists of more than 
170 scientific institutions, including 4 international 
institutions, at which more than 75,000 persons work. It 
consists of 194 academicians and 268 corresponding members, as 
well as 53 foreign members from 16 countries. 
  During the years of existence of the Academy numerous 
scientific schools were formed within its walls. Our Academy is 
among the leading scientific centers of East Europe and in many 
fields occupies leading positions in world science. In its 
creative treasury there are more than 30 discoveries and more 
than a few other attainments in natural science, engineering, as 
well as very significant research in the humanities. 
  Among the most significant achievements of the 1920's-1940's 
was the realization of an artificial nuclear reaction with the 
splitting of lithium atoms and the discovery of a stable isotope 
of lithium, the construction of charged particle accelerators, 
the largest for that time in Europe and the USSR, the 
development of a three-coordinate radar operating in the 
decimeter range, production of indium, liquid hydrogen and 
helium, heavy water, concentrations of ``heavy'' oxygen and 
nitrogen. At the same time superconductors of the second kind 
were discovered, the first experimental confirmation of the 
neutrino hypothesis was obtained and the fundamental possibility 
of direct thermoemission transformation of thermal energy into 
electric energy was demonstrated. 
  In addition, Ukrainian scientists have proposed highly 
productive flux welding and its industrial technology, a 
beginning has been laid for developing molecular spectroscopy 
and electrochemistry, the principles of the theory of 
electrolytes, the phytohormonal theory of tropisms and the 
general biological law of growth of organisms have been 
formulated. During the years of the Great Fatherland War the 
automatic flux welding of the bodies of tanks and artillery 
systems was organized, making possible a substantial improvement 
in their combat qualities and a considerable increase in 
production. 
  During the postwar period the cybernetics specialists of the 
Academy, under the direction of S. Lebedev, created the first 
electronic computer in continental Europe. Ukrainian scientists, 
headed by Academician V. Glushkov, formulated a theory of 
digital automatic devices, serving as a scientific basis for the 
development of new-generation computers. 
  Much has recently been done for the development of a number 
of scientific fields. An example of a major complex piece of 
development work carried out by scientists in different fields 
of specialization -- in information science, physics, materials 
science and chemistry -- is the world's first laser accumulator 
of data on optical cylinders using the optical immersion 
principle. The results of research defining the conditions for 
the formation of diamond-like carbon, hexagonal graphite and 
their mixtures, obtained by the method of high-velocity electron 
beam evaporation and condensation of graphite in a vacuum, are 
the first such results obtained anywhere. 
  The formulation of the theoretical principles of precision 
soldering of silicon nitride ceramics is of great importance for 
machine building. Soldered connections of steel and ceramics in 
the parts of internal combustion and gas turbine engines have 
already been obtained. 
  Professional physicists have established the presence of 
photoinduced light absorption and macroscopic quantum 
interference in high-temperature superconductors. 
  In the molecular biology field the capability of cells to 
change the rate of synthesis of individual _g_-RNA was 
detected, 
which may find application in bioengineering, diagnosis and 
treatment of oncologic and genetic diseases. Academy 
physiologists have developed new methods for studying the 
functions of vitally important macromolecules in nerve and 
muscle cells, have investigated calcium conductivity and other 
properties of the membranes of nerve cells. 
  New trends are characteristic for the development of 
research 
in the social sciences and humanities. The efforts of 
economists, jurists and sociologists have been concentrated on 
carrying out economic reforms and the development of the 
scientific principles of the structural-investment and 
innovative policy of the Ukraine corresponding to governmental 
and juridical acts. 
  Historians, archeologists and archeological historians are 
carrying out major work in restoring the material and spiritual 
monuments of the past and in setting up a national ``Ukrainian 
archival and manuscript bank.'' Philological science has been 
enriched by research on the ancient history of the Slavic 
languages. 
  It must be noted that now, under conditions of an increasing 
economic crisis, Ukrainian science is being inflicted losses 
from which it will be difficult to recover. This is fraught with 
the most severe consequences for the intellectual potential of 
the people. Creative groups and the traditional bonds created 
through the efforts of scientists of several generations are 
being destroyed. The scales of fundamental research in the most 
promising, vitally important directions are being cut back. This 
is accompanied by a reduction in the general level of scientific 
research, is being expressed in the quality of training of 
scientific and scientific-technical specialists and is causing 
irreversible consequences in the entire educational system. The 
shortage of foreign exchange is contributing to the isolation of 
our scientists. Hence the massive brain drain. The most 
promising scientists are going far from the scientific sphere 
and are departing for abroad. All this constitutes an 
unquestionable threat to the national interests of the country. 
  The need for immediate specific steps at the governmental 
level is evident. To be sure, today the sovereign Ukraine for 
objective reasons cannot support the level of science funding 
characteristic of economically well-developed countries. 
However, it must be remembered that precisely the work of 
scientists in many respects favored the economic and social 
progress of these countries. Accordingly, under the present-day 
difficult conditions in order to get through the critical 
situation it is necessary to use the entire creative potential 
of the Academy of Sciences, providing it maximum support. 
  For us work in the interests of the Ukraine is 
high-priority. 
The most acute problem is in the fuel and energy field. Our 
scientists have made a detailed study of needs and our own 
resources and long-term scientific and technical solutions and 
possible directions for development have been defined. Only 
recently were proposals on incorporation of small deposits of 
oil and gas, the use of gas hydrates, mine methane, low-grade 
coal and combustible shales into the energy balance of the 
Ukraine prepared and sent to the government. Multisided research 
is being carried out on the problems involved in energy 
conservation, the use of nontraditional and renewable energy 
sources. Work is being done which is related to broadening of 
the search for and production of oil and gas, the conversion of 
transportation to natural gas and other alternative types of 
fuel. 
  An exceedingly important direction in Academy activity is 
elimination of the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station, in particular, research on the 
propagation of radionuclides over the territory of the Ukraine, 
solution of the problem of multiyear influence of low radiation 
doses on biological objects and man. 
  The Academy also is working out proposals on the development 
of a gold- producing industry in the Ukraine and the draft of a 
program for the mining and processing of precious metals and 
stones. We have the capabilities and in some cases also specific 
goals for meeting needs for new materials, as well as for 
maintaining and further developing research in the interests of 
the defense industry, and also a space program, including as a 
source of new high technologies for the economy. The Academy 
recently signed an agreement on cooperation with the city 
administration of Kiev for the speediest possible resolution of 
city management, the introduction of finalized scientific 
developments into production and on their basis production of 
competitive products with a heavy scientific input. The 
principal fields of cooperation are ecology, energy 
conservation, health protection and cultural and spiritual 
development of the capital. 
  An important aspect of the activity of the Academy of 
Sciences is the maintenance of existing scientific links, the 
broadening of its participation in the international scientific 
community in both bilateral and multilateral arrangements. I 
would like, in particular, to mention the high level of 
cooperation of the work of scientists of the Ukraine and Russia. 
Their productive activity has brought about more than a few 
outstanding achievements and discoveries in world science. These 
contacts must be maintained and strengthened for the well-being 
of our peoples. 
  Our Academy has been received in the International Council 
of 
Scientific Unions with the rights of a national member. In 
September, on the initiative of the Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences in Kiev, the Academies of Sciences of fifteen countries 
signed an agreement on establishing an International Association 
of Academies of Sciences for strengthening the bonds between 
scientists of the East and West, North and South. 
  In conclusion I want to emphasize that the time-tested 
principle in accordance with which our Academy is simultaneously 
constructing both a community of scientists and an association 
of scientific research institutes has justified itself and must 
be safeguarded. Without maintaining traditions and a certain 
conservatism, characteristic for all authoritative academies in 
the world, neither the survival of science in these difficult 
times nor its development in the future will be possible.

``Russian Scientists Departing for the United States in Response 
to the Smell of Hamburgers''; the first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] The article by Sergey Leskov, entitled ``Soviet 
Scientists in America,'' published in the NEW YORK TIMES, is 
long and wordy. It gave rise to lively discussion in the United 
States. We did not deem it reasonable to reproduce this article 
here even in part: from the objections expressed by newspaper 
readers in the Letters to the Editor section in the NEW YORK 
TIMES it is entirely clear what it is all about. We express 
appreciation to those PRAVDA subscribers in the United States 
who brought our attention to this discussion. (The letter from 
Professor R. Khoffmann is published with insignificant 
abridgements). 
  Letter to the Editor: 
``Like many of my colleagues, I am disturbed by the 
irresponsible and presumptuous statements made by Aleksey 
Abrikosov, who Sergey Leskov quotes in the article ``Soviet 
Scientists in America.'' 
  I am one of those who luckily survived the collapse of 
Soviet 
science. I received my post at Princeton University in 1989, at 
the very same time when Doctor Abrikosov became director of the 
High Pressures Institute at Troitsk. Like him, I am the son of 
an academician. Although I detested the privilege which I had, I 
left the Soviet Union in search for freedom and independence, 
and not the ``good food,'' which Abrikosov puts so high on the 
scale. 
  I worked with Doctor Abrikosov at the Theoretical Physics 
Institute imeni Landau at Moscow for about 20 years. I know well 
the ``food lines'' which he discusses. The specialized elite 
distributor (exclusively for academicians) was located on 
Leninskiy Prospekt, several blocks from our apartment. There 
Abrikosov could have met with Doctor Roald Sagdeyev, although 
such a type of meeting occurred extremely rarely. The people 
reaching the corresponding level in the bureaucratic hierarchy 
had the habit of sending their personal drivers and secretaries 
for food products and not wasting their own time on this. 
  The phrase ``he went hungry while working for science'' is a 
bad translation from the Russian (I read the original of this 
interview in one Russian newspaper). In actuality, he said ``he 
hungered for science,'' in the sense that he wanted to work in 
science more than he was able to do in Russia. In actuality, I 
understand this beautifully. After his early success in the 
1950's, when Abrikosov made several surprising discoveries, he 
later produced nothing significant -- neither in Russia nor in 
this country. 
  Such things happen with creatively thinking scientists, 
especially with those who began early, like he. In my case I had 
a similar sort of experience and in actuality, over the course 
of the last years of my stay in the Soviet Union I encountered 
problems similar to those which he describes. However, we cannot 
blame this on the system or on our former colleagues. 
  When I arrived here (in the United States -- S. S.) my 
productivity increased. But I know that most of the ideas which 
I am developing here were formed there in the ``food lines.'' 
Everything which we theoreticians need is a fountain pen and a 
little paper, plus the possibility of discussing our ideas with 
colleagues. All this we had at the Landau Institute: truly I 
never encountered a better place for work than our institute in 
the early 1970's. 
  I want to say: Russia is sick, but by no means dead. It 
survived a far worse crisis after the Revolution when the best 
brains fled from the country and Stalin dealt with whoever 
remained. It's like there's something in the air which generates 
new scientific talents and despite all obstacles induces them to 
develop. All these ``elite'' scientists about whom Doctor 
Abrikosov speaks are products of Russian culture, including he 
himself. 
  Doctor Abrikosov proposes that the West ``assist all 
talented 
scientists to leave Russia and to ignore the others.'' This 
smacks a little of Stalinism! That amused Stalin, moving entire 
nations through the expanses of the empire. But what about those 
who love Russia, those who prefer to share the alarm of their 
country than to leave it, those who feel responsibility for the 
laboratories and institutes which they head, and those who 
simply are still too young to have an international reputation? 
  He, of course, knows all this, so why does he say such 
cynical things? I have an answer for that. I already earlier had 
heard something similar to this from emigrants, to be sure, 
primarily from uneducated people. This is subconscious. It 
bothers us that ``we are eating good food,'' at the same time 
that our colleagues are suffering there in Russia. There are two 
ways to overcome this subconscious split personality: either 
assist them (our colleagues in Russia -- S. S.) or convince 
ourselves that they do not require our assistance. 
  Aleksandr A. Migdal, Professor of Physics, Princeton 
University, Princeton, New Jersey 
  Letter to the Editor: 
  ``The article entitled ``Soviet Scientists in America,'' by 
Sergey Leskov, presents the contrasting points of view of 
Aleksey Abrikosov and Roald Sagdeyev on ways to rescue Russian 
science, obviously giving preference to the opinion of Doctor 
Abrikosov, namely that ``it is useless to assist science in 
Russia'' and that the only path to take is to help talented 
scientists to leave. 
  This is a strange and defeatist logic. I respect the right 
to 
emigration (I myself immigrated to these shores). But the 
superpessimistic, egoistic reasonings about emigration make me 
protest. Russian science in the long run will flourish because 
for this it has the talent and inclination and prehistory.'' 
  Roald Khoffmann, Professor of Physical Sciences, Cornell 
University, Ithaca, New York 
  Translated from English by Sergey Svistunov.

  [Abstract] A two-stage cryptographic transformation system 
with probabilistic selection of pseudo-randomly-long key 
sequences from several initial secret keys is described. This 
system exhibits a resitance to cryptoanalysis, based on the 
known initial text and the corresponding cipher, which is 
sufficient for any practical applications. The first stage 
consists of preliminary preparations when the specific 
transformation mechanism is rearranged, depending on the user 
selected password, and the second stage is the actual coding. A 
programmable three- key cryptomodule was developed, with a 2M 
bit/s coding rate and 16 MHz clock frequency for applications 
with IBM PC/AT type computers. With this module, it was possible 
to convert any initial text into a pseudo-random train of 
characters with code representation by binary numbers from 0 to 
255. The frequency distribution of characters in the code was 
nearly uniform, and the rms deviation was from 1 to 10% 
for 
different texts. This implies that statistical methods of 
cryptoanalysis for deciphering such codes are not effective. It 
is pointed out that in systems with a special type of addressing 
to the on-line memory this method can provide much greater 
coding rates. Figure 1, references: 2 Russian

  [Abstract] A rotation mechanism with two rotation axes is 
normally required for rearranging the pattern of satellite TV 
antennas which would provide independent setting of azimuth and 
the axis' angle. Thus, the antenna can be directed in two stages 
to the selected satellite using its angular coordinates. 
However, the construction of the directing mechanism can be 
simplified, if the limits of the receiving antenna pattern are 
taken into account. Methods are described in this paper for 
computing accurate angular coordinates of optimal rotation axis 
of a single-rotation satellite communication receiving antenna, 
and the estimates are made of the maximum angular error in 
directing such antenna at specified locations, and coordinates 
of the satellite range of longitudes. Figures 3, references 2:

  [Abstract] The coefficients of signal spectrum logarithm 
expansion along base function systems may be used as a 
recognition signature. Feasibility of joined measurement of the 
energy and non-energy signal parameters, reflected from targets 
is analyzed. Algorithms are developed for estimating structural 
parameters applicable to the conditions of regular measurements. 
A system is examined of structural parameters for targets' 
identification. Spectrum analysis of complex signal envelopes, 
reflected from the ``i'' and ``k'' class signals indicate that 
they exhibit values of structural parameters _b_[.sup]_n_[/] 
and _a_[.sup]_n_[/]. For example, the absence of parameters 
_b_[.sup]_n_[/] and _a_[.sub]_n_[/] at _n_&gt; 2, constitute 

a characteristic feature of the spectrum of signals reflected 
from radar targets, combined in a class of single targets. 
Therefore, these parameters may be used as signatures of 
multiple-point targets in the background of single-point 
targets. References 5 Russian.

  [Abstract] The Problem of Error Accumulation in dynamic 
systems because of the effect of Internal Parametric 
Perturbations is examined in this article. The obtained 
estimates of the accumulated perturbations are used for 
determining the frequency of attracting the sources of 
``extraneous'' information about the system motion in order to 
reduce its sensitivity to the parameter variations. The 
capacities of the proposed approach are illustrated by an 
example of estimating the correction periodicity of an 
platformles inertial navigational system located on an aircraft 
flying along a great-circle-track. The aircraft dynamics are 
described and the equations of a platformlessinertial navigation 
system are derived. The sensitivity functions were computed by 
the statistical testing method. Their mathematical expectation 
as a function of the correction periodicity and the rms 
deviations from these values are provided in tables. Tables 2,

of the crystal lattice and by dispersion is examined. Since the 
phenomenon of acoustic magnetic resonance occurs in GaAs in the 
presence of paramagnetic impurity Fe[.sup]2+[/], the 
possibility of realization of acoustic self-induced transparency 
(ASIT) and formation of solitons as well as breezers is also 
examined. Numerical computations demonstrated that with non- 
harmonic oscillations of the lattice and dispersion, the 
excitation of the breezers can not occur. By replacing the Ga 
atoms in the GaAs by atoms of paramagnetic impurity 
Fe[.sup]2+[/], the conditions of the ASIT effect can be 
realized if the system is placed in an external permanent 
magnetic field. Figure 1, references 10: 6 Russian, 4 Western

  [Abstract] The photoluminescence spectra and n-1 exiton 
reflection of i-n[.sup]-[/]-, i-n[.sup]-[/]-n- and i- 
n[.sup]-[/]-n-n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs epitaxial structures, grown 
by the MOS-hydride method were examined at helium temperatures. 
Their electron mode of conductivity was achieved by Si doping. 
On some epitaxial layers with many structural surface defects, 
such as micro-pockets, micro-cracks, oval defects, etc., the 
intrinsic photoluminescence was manifested in a form of 
intensive single band at 1.51514 eV. It was demonstrated that 
with attenuation G&lt; G[.sup]cr[/] this band is caused by the 
polariton luminescence near the surface, and with 
G&gt; G[.sup]cr[/] by the resonant luminescence of the n-1 
exiton. Figures 4, references 26: 12 Russian, 14 Western

  [Abstract] The quality of GaAs layers grown by the 
atomic-layer epitaxy method from a gas phase of metal-organic 
compounds at different substrate temperatures (435-600ëC) 
was analyzed based on measurements of Raman light scattering, 
low-temperature (4.5 K) photoluminescence, Hall coefficient and 
electroconductivity. It was determined that because of the 
presence of carbon acceptors, the examined layers exhibit hole 
conductivity. As the precipitation temperature is increased, a 
gradual improvement is observed of the layers' quality, 
accompanied by a lower concentration of holes and their 
increased mobility. The high degree of purity and the film 
quality, grown at T=600ëC, is confirmed by the results of 
the analysis of the photoluminescence exiton band spectrum. A 
comparison was also made of the layers' characteristic obtained 
with GaAs and Ge substrates in a single technological process. 
It was demonstrated that the properties of the GaAs/Ge layers 
significantly differ from the properties of the homo-epitaxial 
layers. Figures 5, references 11: 1 Russian, 10 Western

  [Abstract] Resonant-tunnel diodes (RTD) based on GaAs/AlAs 
heterostructures were produced using the method of 
molecular-beam epitaxy, and their static volt-ampere 
characteristics were examined. A two-barrier structure (TBS) 
with a 14 nm thick non- doped GaAs layer as a spacer was grown 
on a 1.5 æm thick n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs (doped by Si) with a 3 x 
10[.sup]18[/] cm [.sup]-3[/] concentration of impurity. 
2.5 nm thick AlAs layers were grown as TBS barriers. A 4.5 nm 
GaAs layer was used to form the TBS potential well. The 
difference in optimal temperatures of growing GaAs and AlAs 
constitutes the particular feature of growing this structure. 
Because of this feature, the temperature of the substrate was 
varied during the growing process. The TBS was grown at the 
substrate temperature of 690ëC, and the GaAs layers at the 
temperature of 620ëC. Differences were detected in the 
volt-ampere characteristics of the RTD produced on identical 
heteroepitaxial structures. An equivalent RTD model is proposed. 
The volt-ampere characteristics of the RTD were computed within 
the framework of this model for different conditions. Figures 5,

  [Abstract] The effects are examined of neutron irradiation 
on changes of the distribution profile of zinc atoms in gallium 
lattice points (Zn[.sup]Ga[/]), previously generated by 
thermal diffusion. Thus, this work deals with establishing the 
relationship between the irradiation dose F and the boundary 
shift of previously generated p-n-junction. Light emitting 
diodes (LED) based on GaAs[.sup]1-x[/]P[.sub]x[/] (x=0.37 
- 0.41), obtained by zinc diffusion were examined. Depth of the 
p-n- junction in the initial LED was W[.sup]0[/]= 
2.5+/-0.5æm. Control of changes in the position of the 
p-n-junction with irradiation (F = 10[.sup]10[/] - 
5x10[.sup]13[/] cm[.sup]- 2[/]) was performed by analyzing 
dC/dV- characteristics. Changes in the zinc distribution profile 
and expansion of the compensated region with increased F were 
recorded, indicating that the p-n-junction boundary is shifting 
into the n-region. Curves were obtained showing the relationship 
between the value of the p-n-junction boundary shift as a 
function of F. Figures 2, references 7 Russian.

  [Abstract] Based on studies of the effects of irradiation 
by fast neutrons on photoluminescence of p-GaAs(Zn), it is 
demonstrated that in addition to the familiar mechanisms there 
are other, that can cause changes in the maximum position of the 
bands of impurity luminescence h_n_[.sup]m[/]. In many 
situations changes in the value of h_n_[.sup]m[/] with 
irradiation can also be caused by the dependence of the 
h_n_[.sup]m[/] on the excitation intensity of the 
photoluminescence L, i.e. on the concentration of excess 
minority current carriers. The concentration is significantly 
reduced with increased irradiation dose í, resulting in a 
shift of the position of maximum luminescence h_n_[.sup]m[/] 
with irradiation, and appearance of a dose dependence 
h_n_[.sup]m[/](í), if h_n_[.sub]m[/]=í(L). Graphs were 

obtained of the maximum position of impurity radiation 
h_n_[.sup]m[/] as a function of the irradiation dose by fast 
neutrons í, measured in p-GaAs(Zn) for various excitation 
intensity L and concentrations of excess electrons øn. The 
graphs indicate that in the irradiated crystals, the 
luminescence maximum h_n_[.sup]m[/] is shifted into the 
low-energy region, if measurements are made at large L. However, 
the maximum does not change its position if the measurements are 
made either at small L, of under conditions øn=const. Figures 
2, references 12: 7 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] Numerical physico-technological studies of 
complimentary polysilicon transistor structures (TS) with 
identical, nearly optimal profiles of impurity distribution and 
identical technologies were performed at T=300 K, taking into 
account the temperature-concentration relationships of 
mobilities of major and minor carriers in these structures. The 
complete distribution profiles, identical for n-p-n and p-n-p 
transistor structures with arsenite (As) emitter and collector 
and boron (B) base for the former, and also with B-emitter and 
collector and boron base for the latter are shown in graphs. 
Static and quasi- static parameters of complimentary TS with 
identical profiles of impurity distribution and topology with 
the emitter surface S[.sup]E[/]=1æm[.sup]2[/], were 
examined applying identical physico-topological (PT) models. The 
rate of effective surface recombination at the emitter contacts 
n-p-n and p-n-p of the TS was S[.sup]p[/]= 
1.2x10[.sup]5[/] cm/sec at annealing temperature T &lt; 
900ë C. Graphs are also provided showing the results of PT 
modeling the current-volt characteristic I[.sup]K[/], 
I[.sup]B[/]= f(U[.sub]EB[/]) of complementary TS, the 
current transfer ratio as a function of the collector current 
B=f(I[.sup]K[/]), and the emitter capacitance as a function 
of the collector current C[.sup]TE[/]=f(I[.sub]K[/]).

  [Abstract] Two algorithms are proposed for automatically 
selecting subsets of A-conjugated vectors having a simple 
configuration for a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE) 
with a symmetric positively determined matrix. New computation 
methods of conjugated gradients are developed based on these 
algorithms. A numerical study was carried out of the developed 
methods for a two-dimensional modeling problem of an insulating 
metal-oxide-semiconductor structure with oxide in the shape of a 
``bird beak'', containing non-planar boundaries. With these 
methods, the modeling time can be reduced by a factor of two.

  [Abstract] Emphasis is placed on the development of a 
higher quality of information processing based on existing 
domestic hardware. In this case, a VHF or UHF radio signal is 
used for processing in systems with t hree-dimensional 
integrated circuits. The use of three-dimensional circuits 
decreases size by 1-3 orders of magnitude and incre ases speed 
by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The system consists of control 
devices, phase shifters, attenuators, and various types of 
transmission lines. New and improved wideband UHF and VHF 
control devices are needed to foster development of these 
systems. An application program package has been developed to 
design control devices. Methods of increasing the bandwidth of 
the system are discussed. Various types of control devices are 
described. Equations are derived which may be used to analyze 
the charact eristics of the devices. Various types of 
trnasmission line junctions are discussed. Equations are 
presetned which can be used to evaluate the amplitude-frequency 
characteristic and phase-frequency characteristic of various 
types of junctions. Synthesis of circuit junctions is 
addressed. Figures show various junction topologies. Figures 12; 
tables 2; references 10: Russian.

  [Abstract]An algorithm is examined for adaptive control of 
a multidimensional linear stochastic plant. This algorithm is 
based on the usage of recurrent estimates of stochastic 
approximations with weighted averaging. Of primary interest was 
the speed with which the quality criterion converges with the 
optimal operating mode for a closed system. It is shown that the 
usage of a stochastic approximation algorithm with weighted 
averaging allows the maximum possible convergence speed to be 
achieved, if the necessary a priori information is available. 
The objective of control is to minimize threshold values of the 
output signal second moment, which is time averaged. The 
asymptotic properties in the sequence of estimates and average 
losses are researched. Conditions are established for asymptotic 
efficiency of the control algorithm. 29 references.

  [Abstract]A functional diagnosis of a Kalman filtration 
algorithm is examined. Kalman filtration is carried out in an 
on- board digital computer which is subjected to upsets and 
failures. Upsets, failures and interference when information is 
transferred can cause the computer to produce incorrect results. 
Among the several possible control and diagnostics methods, the 
method chosen is based on analytical redundancy, which is 
algorithmic in nature. To test this method, the dimensions of 
the filter are increased by one unit of measure in order to 
establish the control. This allowed the whole range of control 
relations to be obtained, including algebraic invariants which 
are used to locate and localize defects. This methods occupies 
relatively few resources of the computer and makes it possible 
to discover failures and mistakes in the operation of the 
digital computer as they occur, which allows distorted results 
to be blocked, as well as prohibits mistakes from multiplying. 2

  [Abstract] A feasibility of constructing different types of 
optical memory devices based on interference systems of spatial 
light scanning with wavelength re-tunable semiconductor 
injection lasers is examined and an analysis is made of their 
characteristics. Functioning of these devices is based on the 
effect of changes in the spatial structure of the interference 
picture at the output of a multiple-beam Fizo interferometer 
(FI) with changes in the wavelength of laser which illuminates 
the interferometer. Optical memory devices with one Fizo 
interferometer and two crossed FI in the scanning system are 
discussed. A block diagram of a simple optical memory device 
with a multiple-beam FI in the scanning system is provided. 
Problems of constructing memory devices with a super-large 
capacity are also examined. Figures 4, references 8 Russian.

  [Abstract] A feasibility of developing a digital 
optoelectronic processor of multi-level images employing an 
algebraic addition of sign changing matrices is examined. This 
study is based on a stack coding concept. With stack coding the 
number is being coded by a stack in K plane image matrices, 
while the least significant bit is fixed in the first matrix, 
the next significant bit in the second matrix, etc. Thus, all 
the initial numbers, as well as the results of processing can be 
represented by K digits, i.e. by K representations with 
dimensions NxM, each containing digit shears NxM of binary 
numbers. A space-continuous arithmetic-logic device is developed 
for synthesis of algebraic additions of sign-changing matrices. 
The multi-input arithmetic- logic device for processing binary 
images is a fundamental operating unit for expanding the 
functional capacity and speed of processing. Figures 3,

  [Abstract] Multiplicative exponential asymptotics of the 
splitting value in any order of a small parameter h is computed 
for the Shroedinger operator. A general case of several 
symmetrical point-wells, and wells organized in nondegenerated 
manifolds is also examined along with the multiplicative 
asymptotics of the lower eigenfunctions. First, a case of two 
potential wells is examined and three theorems are derived. 
Employing the Wentzel/Kramers/Brillouin method, equations can be 
obtained for a general situation, when the potential V is 
invariant under the impact of a finite group of orthogonal 
transformations and when there is a nondegenerated potential 
minimum in each fundamental region. References 15: 8 Russian, 7

  [Abstract] A medical radio-tomograph is 
proposed. The tomograph is designed for active selective 
diagnostics in conjunction with frequent therapy of internal 
organs in the millimeter to decimeter wave range. Its 
functioning is based on combining the principles of selective 
holography with adaptive location. The methodology of microwave 
nonlinear tomography, based on methods of contrasting 
substances, a priory radio- testing and adaptive self-focusing 
of radio-illumination is described. A diagram of the 
radio-tomograph is provided and the algorithm of its functioning 
is also described. Implementation of the proposed scientific 
principles and engineering solutions would improve the spacial 
resolution, the contrast range, and the information content of 
radio-holograms; expand the spectrum of applications (biomedical 
diagnostics, selective analysis and thermal processing, 
non-invasive defectoscopy etc); and increase the diagnostic and 
therapeutic capacities of the radio-tomograph (additional 
diagnostic information, focused treatment or heating of the 
internal organs, etc). Figure 1, references 14: Russian.

  [Abstract] A method is proposed for studying nonlinear 
distortions in a circuit with complex nonlinearity. This method 
involves a transformation analysis of the spectrum of complex 
envelope of analytical signals on the complex equivalent 
characteristic of instantaneous values representing the 
nonlinearity. An algorithm for the spectrum transformation on a 
nonlinear element with specified amplitude and phase-amplitude 
characteristics and a program for its execution was 
developed.The algorithm includes the following operations: 
computation of the amplitude characteristics of the ``real'' 
A[.sup]c[/] and``imaginary'' A[.sub]s[/] signal 
transmission channels from specified amplitude and 
phase-amplitude characteristic; approximation of the 
A[.sup]c[/] and A[.sub]s[/]characteristic by odd

  [Abstract] The emergence of new-generation aerospace 
equipment, e.g., super- and hypersonic aircraft, space shuttles, 
cryoplanes, etc., calls for developing new materials and their 
manufacturing and processing technologies as well as methods of 
identifying the flying vehicle status during operation. The 
problem of developing new methods of nondestructive testing of 
welds is especially acute in aerospace engineering. Acoustic 
testing based on the integral link between the metal structure 
and its mechanical and acoustic characteristics is one of the 
most promising methods whereby the material structure fully 
determines its physical and mechanical properties, such as 
ductility, strength, thermal conductivity, etc., while also 
determining the characteristic features of elastic vibration 
generation and propagation, i.e, the propagation velocity, 
damping factor, acoustic emission intensity and its spectral 
composition and phase correlations, etc. In particular, 
attention is focused on ultrasonic and acoustic emission methods 
and their advantages. A block diagram of the general acoustic 
testing principle and a block diagram of a new-generation 
acoustic diagnostic complex are cited, and the acoustic data 
processing methods are described. Such a real-time 
computer-based system may be placed on-board an aircraft but it 
may be more efficient as a means of incoming and final 
inspection. A plan for further development of acoustic 
diagnostic methods is outlined. Figures 4; references 1.

  [Abstract] The increasing stringency of the requirements 
imposed on the economic and environmental indicators of aircraft 
gas turbine engines (AGTD) brought to the forefront the issue of 
using liquefied hydrogen or natural gas as motor fuel which 
calls for preliminary fuel gasification in a special heat 
exchanger. The development of such heat exchangers-gasifiers is 
fraught with a number of problems, e.g., selecting the heat 
exchanger location, ensuring a stable cryogenic fuel flow in the 
heat exchanger channels, selecting the fuel preheating regime, 
etc. The solution to these problems is complicated by a lack of 
reliable design methods. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made 
to develop an analysis technique using the example of heat 
exchanger-gasifiers for NK-88 and NK-89 engines. The design of 
the heat exchanger and heat and mass transfer processes during 
cryogenic fuel gasification are described in detail, a 
mathematical model of the process is formulated, and an 
algorithm for solving the resulting equations is proposed. The 
analytical method of designing heat exchangers for cryogenic 
fuel gasification with two-phase flow conditions inside the 
pipes and frosting on the outside surface is verified 
experimentally. The maximum spread between the analytical and 
experimental data is within 15-25% which attests to the 
mathematical model's adequacy for practical applications.

into 5-7 æm powder with a bulk density of 3,240 
kg/m[.sup]3[/] and a 0.55 W/m[.sup].[/]K effective thermal 
conductivity, e.g., for use in hydride compressors for 
space-based hydrogen refrigerators where heat is supplied by the 
sun and removed by radiators, prompted attempts to optimize the 
mass characteristics of such refrigerators for subsequent use in 
spacecraft. Adsorption isotherms of the 
LaNi[.sup]5[/]-H[.sub]x[/] system, i.e., the dependence of 
the equilibrium hydrogen pressure on its specific mass content 
at various temperatures, the relationship between the heat 
delivery and extraction temperatures of the hydride compressor 
radiators, the hydrogen refrigerator T-S-curve, and 
the dependence of the total radiator area on the precooling 
temperature at various pressures are plotted. The total radiator 
area has a clearly marked precooling temperature minimum which 
also depends on the refrigerator's remaining parameters. Figures

  [Abstract] The importance of estimating the attainable 
lift-to-drag ratio and the facilities for increasing it in order 
to determine the aircraft shape which ensures the necessary 
lift-to-drag ratio at the design flight path section prompted an 
analysis of lift-to-drag ratios at supersonic velocities. To 
this end, flows behind a diagonal (oblique) shock and 
rarefaction wave are considered ignoring friction loss for a 
wing shaped as an infinite wedge and a triangular plate with 
supersonic leading edges. The advantages of an oblique wing over 
a delta wing are employed in a symmetric wing. The study shows 
that the lift-to-drag ratio of an infinite oblique plate may be 
considerably higher than that of triangular plates with 
subsonic, sonic, and supersonic edges whereby a wing with 
characteristic side edges is the simplest swept wing but only 
until the velocity component behind the shock normal to the edge 
reaches the speed of sound. Overall, a straight wedge with 
lateral washers is the optimum bearing airframe shape. Analyses 
shows that a combination of straight wedge airframe and plate 
wing produce a noticeable lift-to-drag ratio gain due to a lift 
redistribution between them. Figures 6; tables 1; references 13: 
12 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] Hypersonic flow of a viscous gas over a plane 
delta wing with finite length at a null angle of attack at a 
given surface temperature with a symmetric wake is considered in 
a Cartesian system of coordinates with an origin at the delta 
wing vertex assuming that the characteristic Reynolds number is 
large yet subcritical, so that the boundary layer and wake flow 
is laminar, and it is further postulated that an intermediate 
interaction regime is realized on the principal wing section and 
in the wake, and that strong interaction areas form only in the 
wing vertex and leading edge vicinity. The boundary value 
problem is solved by the finite difference method. For 
illustration, a plane delta wing in a flow is considered 
allowing for the wake flow. The pressure distribution on the 
wing (and, for comparison, that of a delta wing with a given 
trailing edge pressure), the boundary layer displacement 
thickness distribution, the friction stress coefficient 
distribution in the longitudinal direction, the velocity and 
enthalpy distribution on the wake axis, and the pressure 
distribution along the wing span with an interaction parameter 
of _ch_[.sup]*[/]=2 are plotted. The findings demonstrate that 
the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing within a 
0.5ó_ch_[.sup]*[/]ó3 interaction parameter range differ from 

those of a wing in a flow with a given trailing edge pressure by 
10-15%. Figures 6; references 14: 13 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] Steady-state supersonic flow of a viscous 
chemically and thermodynamically nonequilibrium gas mixture 
about a smooth blunt body is considered on the basis of a model 
of parabolized Navier-Stokes equations which are an asymptotic 
form of Navier-Stokes equations under specific constraints in a 
body axes system of coordinates. The slip, temperature shock, 
and catalytic atom recombination effects on the wall are taken 
into account in defining the boundary conditions. The effect of 
nonequilibrium excitation of translational and vibrational 
degrees of freedom on the dissociation reactions is examined. A 
numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations is sought by the 
method of global pressure gradient iterations. For illustration, 
the results of numerical calculations of hypersonic flow about 
an axisymmetric hyperboloid which simulates a space shuttle 
vehicle streamline within an 85-110 km attitude range are 
presented. A model with different vibrational temperatures of 
molecular components is also considered whereby the inverse 
impact of chemical reactions on vibrational relaxation is taken 
into account. The findings are compared to the results direct 
statistical simulation by the Monte Carlo method for the same 
conditions. Figures 5; references 14: 6 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Text] (Main theses were presented and distributed 
04-09-93 at a meeting of the Interbranch Commission on Problems 
of Continuing Operation of the ChAES [Chernobyl AES]; the 
Commission had been organized on assignment of the Cabinet of 
Ukraine No. 15083/64 of 11-16-92).The ChAES administration 
substantiates the possibility and feasibility of continuing the 
operation of the ChAES based mainly on the following three 
factors:1) economic inexpediency of decommissioning the ChAES; 
2) a sufficient safety level; and 3) the human factor.Therefore 
one must evaluate all pro and contra factors within the context 
of these three categories.I. Economic 
Considerations.In regards to economic arguments for 
continuing the operation of ChAES one should note that when 
providing economic justification of continuing the operation the 
principle aspect is determining potential economic losses caused 
by possible heavy accidents at the ChAES.Taking into account the 
current economic conditions, liquidation of potential accident 
effects of an even substantially lower scale compared to the 
1986 accident will result in disproportionately large direct 
economic losses. Under these circumstances it is hard even to 
estimate the blow to the national economy.It is worth noting 
that the absence of established in advance criteria of economic, 
organizational and technological acceptability and the risk of 
continuing the ChAES operation, which would provide an 
appropriate gauge for a skilled analysis of the factors under 
consideration, does not make possible an unambiguous assessment 
of continuing the ChAES operation.II. Safety Level 
ChAEs administration justifies sufficiency of the safety level 
mainly by the large number of safety improving measures taken 
after 1986. But in doing so the basic deficiencies of RBMK [the 
type of ChAES reactors] have not been eliminated, namely: 
the absence of a localization system for the upper 
(steam water) section of reactor pipelines; as a result, in the 
case of a certain accident (rupture of the PVK [expansion not 
given], separator drum and/or steam lines to the GZZ [expansion 
not given]) an indeterminate amount of radioactive heat transfer 
agent can be released into the environment. In addition, such 
accident leads to a loss of the heat transfer agent and can 
result in drying the fuel core with all accompanying 
consequences;) the reactor vulnerability to ruptures 
of technological channels (according to calculations performed 
by the Chief Designer the localization system was designed for 
rupture of not more than two to three channels, and independent 
experts surmise the possibility of the mechanism of a chain-like 
increase of the number of TK [expansion not given] ruptures 
after a rupture of one channel); such accident is analogous to 
the 1986 accident; vulnerability of the steel 
zirconium joints in technological channels to temperature 
fluctuations and their uncertain behavior in the case of thermal 
shocks (for instance, a false or prearranged operation of the 
SAOR [expansion not given] system); low quality and 
reliability of the equipment, especially of shutoff and control 
valves and the ``SKALA'' computing control system (the service 
life of the latter had been used up long ago); the 
absence of protection of safety important equipment from 
negative environmental factors (temperature, humidity and impact 
loads), which makes this equipment vulnerable in accident 
situations; the absence of physical separation of 
power supply cables for standby equipment of safety and safety 
important systems and separation of power and control cable 
flows; inefficiency of the generator room 
fire-fighting system and vulnerability of design solutions 
related to placement of safety important systems in the 
generator room; a large number if welded joints in 
the first loop (KMPTs [expansion not given] and the absence of 
state-of-the-art diagnostic systems.In addition, the 
insufficient current safety level is substantially affected by 
the following factors: unsatisfactory level of the 
safety culture, which is indicated by a large number of 
additional failures and defects detected during scheduled 
simulated accident situations; miscalculations of the 
existing system of providing corrective actions based on results 
of investigation of incidents and accident situations; this was 
noted by the IAEA expert ASSET mission based on results of 
investigating the circumstances of the 1991 fire of the second 
unit. Human FactorFrom the standpoint of social 
factors and the problem of employment of highly skilled 
personnel, continuing the operation to 1997 will not eliminate 
the problem in principle it will only postpone it for some 
time.Under these conditions and taking into account predominant 
safety considerations when considering the problem of stopping 
the CHAES operation, one should consider the availability of a 
large number of skilled personnel within a different context, 
namely, as a positive factor which can solve the problem of 
manning new units of AES with VVER 1000 [reactor type] if a 
substantiated decision is made to stop the moratorium on their 
commissioning.Based on the above arguments, Minpryrody considers 
the substantiation of the possibility of continuing the 
operation of the Chernobyl AES insufficient and the Supreme 
Soviet decision regarding decommissioning of the Chernobyl AES 
inexpedient.``UKRAYINSKA GAZETA''. By publishing a 
selection of documents related to continuing operation of the 
Chernobyl AES we are hoping to inform our readers about the 
Acting Prime Minister's response as to the position of both 
sides, as well as to receive a clear Minpryrody answer as to 
what to do with our AES and how to do it.

  [Text] (Main theses were presented and distributed 
04-09-93 at a meeting of the Interbranch Commission on Problems 
of Continuing Operation of the ChAES [Chernobyl AES]; the 
Commission had been organized on assignment of the Cabinet of 
Ukraine No. 15083/64 of 11-16-92). 
  The ChAES administration substantiates the possibility and 
feasibility of continuing the operation of the ChAES based 
mainly on the following three factors: 
  1.Economic inexpediency of decommissioning the ChAES; 
  2.A sufficient safety level 
  3.The human factor. 
  Therefore one must evaluate all pro and contra factors 
within 
the context of these three categories. 
  I. Economic Considerations. 
  In regards to economic arguments for continuing the 
operation 
of ChAES one should note that when providing economic 
justification of continuing the operation the principle aspect 
is determining potential economic losses caused by possible 
heavy accidents at the ChAES. 
  Taking into account the current economic conditions, 
liquidation of potential accident effects of an even 
substantially lower scale compared to the 1986 accident will 
result in disproportionately large direct economic losses. Under 
these circumstances it is hard even to estimate the blow to the 
national economy. 
  It is worth noting that the absence of established in 
advance 
criteria of economic, organizational and technological 
acceptability and the risk of continuing the ChAES operation, 
which would provide an appropriate gauge for a skilled analysis 
of the factors under consideration, does not make possible an 
unambiguous assessment of continuing the ChAES operation. 
  II. Safety Level 
  The ChAEs administration justifies sufficiency of the safety 
level mainly by the large number of safety improving measures 
taken after 1986. But in doing so the basic deficiencies of RBMK 
[the type of ChAES reactors] have not been eliminated, namely: 
  - the absence of a localization system for the 
upper (steam-water) section of reactor pipelines; as a result, 
in the case of a certain accident (rupture of the PVK [expansion 
not given], separator drum and/or steam lines to the GZZ 
[expansion not given]) an indeterminate amount of radioactive 
heat- transfer agent can be released into the environment. In 
addition, such accident leads to a loss of the heat-transfer 
agent and can result in dewatering the fuel core with all 
accompanying consequences; 
  - the reactor vulnerability to ruptures of 
technological channels (according to calculations performed by 
the Chief Designer the localization system was designed for 
rupture of not more than two to three channels, and independent 
experts surmise the possibility of the mechanism of a chain-like 
increase of the number of TK [expansion not given] ruptures 
after a rupture of one channel); such accident is analogous to 
the 1986 accident; 
  - vulnerability of the steel-zirconium joints in 
technological channels to temperature fluctuations and their 
uncertain behavior in the case of thermal shocks (for instance, 
a false or prearranged operation of the SAOR [expansion not 
given] system); 
  - low quality and reliability of the equipment, 
especially of shutoff and control valves and the ``SKALA'' 
computing control system (the service life of the latter had 
been used up long ago); 
  - the absence of protection of safety-important 
equipment from negative environmental factors (temperature, 
humidity and impact loads), which makes this equipment 
vulnerable in accident situations; 
  - the absence of physical separation of power 
supply cables for standby equipment of safety and 
safety-important systems and separation of power and control 
cable flows; 
  - inefficiency of the generator room fire-fighting 
system and vulnerability of design solutions related to 
placement of safety-important systems in the generator room; 
  - a large number if welded joints in the first 
loop (KMPTs [expansion not given]) and the absence of 
state-of-the-art diagnostic systems. 
  In addition, the insufficient current safety level is 
substantially affected by the following factors: 
  - unsatisfactory level of the safety culture, 
which is indicated by a large number of additional failures and 
defects detected during scheduled simulated accident situations; 
  - miscalculations of the existing system of 
providing corrective actions based on results of investigation 
of incidents and accident situations; this was noted by the IAEA 
expert ASSET mission based on results of investigating the 
circumstances of the 1991 fire of the second unit. 
  As far as the measures aimed at improving neutron-physical 
parameters of RBMK that were implemented in operating ChAES 
units are concerned, one should also note the presence of 
essentially negative consequences of modernization of the 
control and protection system (CPS), the most serious of which 
are: 
increased positive effect of dewatering of the CPS 
coolant circuit, which under certain situations of compensation 
with rods during reaching a critical state (the most vulnerable 
moment) can get as high as 5-6 eff; and it should be noted that 
this positive reactivity is released when draining water just 
within approximately two meters of the middle section of the 
fuel core (which is indicated by results of 1987 physical 
experiments in the third unit); 
when operating at nominal capacity the operational 
reactivity margin is mostly comprised of rods submerged into the 
core, so the actual operating reactivity margin is much lower 
than computed by ``SKALA'' (43-48 RR [expansion not given]); the 
remaining rods are mainly located in the VK [expansion not 
given] (except local automatic regulators). These factors are 
playing the principle role in reducing AZ-5 [expansion not 
given] effectiveness during the first second of its operation: 
  - reduced subcriticality margin of the reactor 
when stopping it and impossibility of repair modes without 
introducing additional absorbers into the core. 
  Concentrating one's attention on using up the 
channel-graphite clearance as the main and only factor that 
determines the possibility or impossibility of continuing 
operation of RBMK is artificial. The RBMK has a lot of other 
drawbacks, and a large number of those have not yet been 
detected and analyzed. The most significant is the regularity 
and sequence of dangerous RBMK accidents after 1986 (the most 
striking examples are an LAES [Leningrad AES] accident in March 
of 1992 and a complicated fire in the generator room of the 
second unit in October of 1991). 
  Thus, the problem of increasing the safety level after the 
modernizations leaves open the main problem: is the current RBMK 
safety level acceptable? From the standpoint of requirements of 
international safety rules and even the former Soviet Union 
rules the safety level of this type of reactors is unacceptable. 
  - III. Human Factor 
  From the standpoint of social factors and the problem of 
employment of highly skilled personnel, continuing the operation 
to 1997 will not eliminate the problem in principle - it will 
only postpone it for some time. 
  Under these conditions and taking into account predominant 
safety considerations when considering the problem of stopping 
the CHAES operation, one should consider the availability of a 
large number of skilled personnel within a different context, 
namely, as a positive factor which can solve the problem of 
manning new units of AES with VVER-1000 [reactor type] if a 
substantiated decision is made to stop the moratorium on their 
commissioning. 
  Based on the above arguments, Minpryrody considers the 
substantiation of the possibility of continuing the operation of 
the Chernobyl AES insufficient and the Supreme Soviet decision 
regarding decommissioning of the Chernobyl AES inexpedient. 
  ``UKRAYINSKA GAZETA''. By publishing a selection of 
documents related to continuing operation of the Chernobyl AES 
we are hoping to inform our readers about the Acting Prime 
Minister's response as to the position of both sides, as well as 
to receive a clear Minpryrody answer as to what to do with our 
AES and how to do it.
