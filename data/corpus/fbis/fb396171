  [Text] The Congolese authorities are not satisfied with the 
latest comments by French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, 
who said that he is concerned about the evolution of the 
Congolese situation. He also expressed doubt about President 
Lissouba's ability to solve the crisis. Foreign Minister 
Benjamin Bounkoulou, who is quite irritated, spoke to Monique 
Mas: 
  [Begin Bounkoulou recording] The reasons that impelled Mr. 
Roussin to react in this way -- the assessment he made about our 
president -- are unacceptable. His remarks are discourteous 
toward a president of a country that is a friend of France. 
This assessment is not in line with the traditions of 
friendship between Congo and France; it is not in line with the 
elementary principles of diplomacy and international law for a 
minister of a friendly country to judge a head of state in this 
way. It is all the more serious since Mr. Roussin has very 
friendly relations with President Pascal Lissouba. What is very 
surprising about these remarks by Minister Roussin is that the 
previous day a French Government statement issued by the Foreign 
Ministry noted the search for a political solution under the 
authority of President Lissouba. [end recording] 
  The French ambassador to Brazzaville was summoned to the 
Congolese Foreign Ministry this morning.

  [Text] There is a discordant note in the relations between 
Congo and France. In an interview with AFP on 29 December, the 
French cooperation minister commented on the political situation 
in Congo. He said, among other things, that there are no 
national armed forces in Congo and described as unbearable the 
fact that French nationals living in Brazzavile are being 
harassed. 
  Michel Roussin asked President Pascal Lissouba to take the 
necessary measures in order to show his abilities as a leader. 
The reaction was swift. The Congolese Foreign Ministry 
described the statement as discourteous. Francis Tamalax has 
details: 
  [Begin Tamalax recording] At a time when national forces 
need 
to harmonize their actions with the mediation activities of our 
friends, (Machiavel Tadikisa Massanga), spokesman for the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Congo was surprised at 
the unfriendly attitude of a French political authority. This 
attitude introduces a discordant note in the good relations 
existing between Congo and France. Brazzaville nonetheless has 
reiterated its faith by taking care of its friends during the 
disturbances experienced by the country, notably France, whose 
political commitment in favor of Congo has never wavered. The 
Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that, except for 
some minor incidents that it regrets and strongly condemns, 
foreigners living in Congo have been safe from the violence 
which led to the deaths of about 80 people in the south of 
Brazzaville, the capital, from 10 to 14 December. [end 
recording] 
  One of the consequences of the political violence in Congo 
is 
the fear that is gripping French nationals. In recent days 
several French nationals, including two diplomats, have been 
attacked or mistreated by unknown individuals in Brazzaville. 
About 30 French technical assistants are planning to leave 
Congo in the coming days and will follow about 40 others who 
recently left the Congolese capital with their families and 
possessions. 
  On the economic level, things are no better. The disruption 
in rail traffic between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire following 
the political violence has resulted in an increase in prices for 
essential goods and the scarcity of some products in the 
Congolese capital. Bread is becoming scarce due to a scarcity of 
flour, and the price has risen from 50 to 75 CFA francs. 
Similarly, a portion of cassava, usually sold for 500 CFA 
francs, now costs 1500 CFA francs at the city's largest market. 
Chinchards, the sea fish that is the most widely consumed by 
Congolese, can no longer be found. The price of a kilo of rice 
has doubled from 200 to 400 CFA francs, and bananas have 
disappeared from most markets. These scarcities are attributed 
to the proliferation of black market deals organized by Zairians 
who cross the river in canoes loaded with cassava flour. 
  Apart from foodstuffs, Zairian clandestine fuel traders, 
nicknamed al-Qadhdhafis, sell fuel at 1000 CFA francs per liter, 
compared to the 300 CFA francs on the official market. 
  Congo-Ocean railroad traffic, the only permanent link 
between 
the capital and the Pointe-Noire port -- the main economic 
center of the country -- has been interrupted for 10 days. 
Opposition supporters have erected barricades on the rails to 
denounce political violence in the Congolese capital.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 2 (AFP) -- At least four people 
died and many others were shot when government forces and 
opposition militiamen clashed in Brazzaville's southern Bacongo 
district, hospital officials announced Sunday [2 January]. 
Military officials said the clashes overnight Friday broke out 
after armed opposition rebels, identified as "ninjas," attacked 
an army camp at Bacongo. The army used heavy weapons to repel 
the submachine-gun toting rebels. 
  But opposition spokesman Laurent Mann accused the members of 
the national police's ministerial reserve of attacking the 
opposition militia and "shooting at passers-by at close range." 
Mann said the number of casualties was much higher and five 
bodies had still not been retrieved from Bacongo as no Red Cross 
workers had been allowed in. 
  The worst violence ended Saturday afternoon but witnesses 
said shots could still be heard at Bacongo Sunday morning. 
  At least 93 people have died since new violence erupted in 
the southern neighborhoods of the Congolese capital between 
supporters of the government and the opposition in early 
December, according to a hospital tally.

  [Text] Within the framework of establishing transitional 
institutions to include the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the 
republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
[MRND], [words indistinct] Hotel, Umubano. In the opinion of 
the MRND, the responsibility for the stalemate can only be 
blamed on the current prime minister and on the person who will 
lead the great transition. Here is MRND national Secretary 
Joseph Nzirorera: 
  [Begin Nzirorera recording] The MRND feels that the 
blackmail and tricks of outgoing Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana and of Faustin Twagiramungu, prime 
minister-designate of the transitional broad-based government, 
constitute a serious handicap to the process of peace and 
democratization in which our country is resolutely engaged. 
  The MRND feels that the stalemate in the establishment of 
the 
institutions stipulated in the Arusha Accord is mainly to be 
blamed on the prime minister-[designate] of the transitional 
broad-based government, who does not want to fully implement the 
accord from the Arusha negotiations, and instead indulges in 
meddling in the internal conflicts of parties in order to defend 
partisan and disreputable interests. 
  The MRND strongly denounces the prime minister's 
interference 
in the internal affairs of political parties which are called 
upon to participate in the transitional institutions. The MRND 
was surprised by the behavior, which resembled that of the 
minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, of outgoing Prime 
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who unilaterally announced the 
date of the establishment of the transitional institutions and 
went on to accuse the president of the Republic of not wanting 
to take the oath before the Constitutional Court, although she 
well knew that negotiations were still in progress and far from 
being concluded. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The ceremonies sanctioning the establishment of 
the Transitional National Assembly and the broad-based 
transitional government, which were scheduled to take place 
yesterday and today respectively, as desired by Dr. 
Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Rwanda, did not take place. There was still 
hope yesterday that the ceremonies might take place today. 
  The commander in chief of the UN Mission for Assistance to 
Rwanda, General Romeo Dallaire, had allowed for a postponement 
of only 24 hours. [passage omitted] 
  The main obstacle in the way of the establishment of the 
transitional institutions, namely the National Assembly and the 
broadbased transitional government, is the problem of divisions 
within some political parties which have been called upon to 
participate in the institutions. The said parties have not 
managed to nominate their representatives for the National 
Assembly and ministers to the transitional broadbased government. 
  There is no sign of the institutions being established 
before 
the scheduled deadlines. We are wondering when the transitional 
institutions will be installed. Will we wait for an end to 
divisions within political parties before we get moving again? 
What is almost sure is that we cannot wait indefinitely for an 
end to these quarrels before we put in place transitional 
institutions, due to the urgency of establishing them. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [First installment of an interview with President Isayas </F>
Afewerki by local reporters; date and place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Isayas] On 16 December at a place called (Adi 
Hawke), which is about 20 to 30 kms from (Shenkit), 20 armed men 
who came from Sudan fought with our units in the area and were 
all killed. This is not a new incident because there have been 
similar clashes at the border. What makes this latest incident 
more important than previous ones is that the group included two 
Moroccans. These people claim they are to liberate the whole 
region and that they are connected with the Jihad movement of 
Afghanistan and of other regions. For the past two to three 
years we have been trying to solve this issue with the Sudanese 
Government in a very constructive way. 
  There was no practical action taken to contain or control 
these activities other than empty promises. Generally speaking, 
we did not want to speak out. We believed we could solve the 
problem patiently and constructively because it was not our 
internal problem but a foreign problem. Since the source of the 
problem is Sudan, we were trying to solve it in collaboration 
with the Sudanese Government and other forces in Sudan. This is 
what we believed. However, while we were trying to solve the 
problem such incidents continued to occur. The issue remained 
outstanding. 
  Finally, there was this incident on 16 December. The said 
people were killed and one of our unit commanders was killed. 
We do not want any Eritrean killed, particularly at this time 
when there is no reason for any Eritrean to be killed. We 
cannot keep a death on our side a secret. We do not regard this 
incident as a victory. In the past our policy was extreme 
tolerance, because we did not want the issue to get out of hand, 
but now it has reached this stage. We do not care about those 
who were killed in the previous fighting, but because there is 
no reason for a combatant to be killed now, after independence, 
because we do not want such incidents to happen again, and 
because we do not want the matter to be kept secret, we are 
informing the public about the war which has been declared on 
Eritrea and its people. [passage omitted] 
  We see no reason for foreigners coming all the way from 
Morocco, Tunisia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to fight in this 
country. Moreover, we cannot keep silent when such a war is 
declared on us, nor can we keep silent before the world. This 
is because we have managed to reach this stage after a long and 
protracted war. We are therefore trying our best to solve this 
problem not only in the interests of our country, but also in 
the interests of the region. [passage omitted] 
  We know how to play with fire. There are different types of 
fire. We have enough experience in how to play with fire in the 
past, and we no longer want to play with fire. Enough is 
enough. [passage omitted] We will persevere, but this does not 
mean that our patience is inexhaustible and it does not mean 
that we will continue with the same policy we have been 
following. The people know where their duty lies. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified reporter] Won't such an incident negatively 
affect the historical good-neighborly relations with our 
neighbors, particularly when the attempts are connected with 
foreign intervention from abroad? 
  [Isayas] The Jihad movement in Eritrea was formed by the 
Sudanese National Islamic Front. This is clear to all. The 
front also knows and admits the fact. It is not a secret.

  [Text] The Nakuru District commissioner, Mr. William 
Kerario, has appealed to the people living at the Nakuru/Narok 
border to remain calm as security personnel tried to solve an 
incident in which raiders believed to be the Kikuyus from 
(Ndefo) farm in Nakuru attacked villagers of (Likia) village and 
escaped with over 150 head of cattle belonging to the Maasai 
before slashing 20 others. 
  Speaking in Nakuru after visiting the area, Mr. Kerario said 
that security has been beefed up in the area. He said a group 
of over 30 men from (Ndefo) farm crossed the border and attacked 
the villagers yesterday morning. 
  Following the incident, Mr. Kerario added that Maasai morans 
[warriors] grouped and pursued the raiders who they also 
attacked, killing four of them before the others took off with 
the animals. Mr. Kerario said that quick action by police who 
received the information managed to recover 22 of the animals at 
(Ndefo) farm and arrested 44 suspects, eight of whom were 
positively identified by (Likia) villagers as part of the 
raiders. He said that police also recovered a homemade gun at 
the scene of the fight. 
  Terming the incident as a deliberate move by some people to 
revive the tribal clashes in the area, Mr. Kerario said that the 
government viewed this seriously. He said that the incident 
happened only two days after another group of raiders attacked 
Ndorobos [tribe] and stole their animals at Marioshoni Forest in 
the district, and vowed that the government will act swiftly 
and firmly to ensure that peace prevailed. At the same time 
Mr. Kerario appealed to residents of the affected areas to 
assist the police with any information that could lead to the 
recovery of the animals and arrest the culprits. He assured 
those who lost their animals that they will be returned to them 
as soon as they are recovered.

  [Excerpt] Thousands of Somalis today signed a petition for 
the withdrawal of foreign forces from Somalia so that the Somali 
people can achieve total peace and understanding. The petition 
is addressed to the UN Security Council and will go via the 
British Government. 
  The petition begins as follows: The NEW DAWN [WAAGA CUSUB] 
newspaper has been asked to campaign for this petition, which is 
the wish of Somali National Alliance [SNA] supporters in 
particular and the Somali people in general. It asks the UN 
Security Council for UN Forces to leave their country and 
release the officials and supporters who were illegally arrested 
and taken from their homes, and who are still in UN Operation in 
Somalia jails. The objective is to let the UN Security Council 
and the international community know the true feelings of the 
Somali people. [passage omitted] 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1146 GMT on 30 December in a 
Mogadishu-datelined item adds: "The petition signed by Aidid's 
supporters in Mogadishu accuses the United Nations of human 
rights abuses, including the detention of Osman Hassan Ali, 
known as `Ato', Aidid's chief financier who was arrested on 
September 21. Two other senior Aidid aides, Omar Salad Elmi and 
Mohamed Hassan Awale, have been held since October 3. The 
petition reiterates Aidid's assertion that the United Nations 
wants trying to colonize Somalia and accuses the world body of 
"creating a hostile atmosphere" by attacks against Aidid's 
faction, causing "the death and injury of an estimated 11,000 
Somali civilians." An Aidid supporter, Abdi Abshir Kahiye, said 
the SNA hoped to hand the petition to UN special envoy to 
Somalia, Jonathan Howe, with more than 50,000 signatures by the 
end of January."]

  [Excerpts] Ali Mahdi Mohamed, president of the Somali 
Republic, sent a congratulatory New Year 1994 message today to 
all the Somali people wherever they may be, beseeching God to 
make this year the year in which the Somali people revive their 
nationhood and find peace amidst the general public of the world 
at large. [passage omitted] 
  The president sent a message of good wishes and 
congratulations to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who 
he said has selflessly stood up for the interests of the Somali 
people, noting the UN Security Council's day and night effort to 
ensure that the crisis in Somalia is resolved. The president 
sent a similar message to the UN Operation in Somalia leadership 
and staff and wished them success. 
  The president further called on the Somali community to make 
use of the international assistance which is badly needed by 
many countries in the world who also face crisis. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the formation of district and regional assemblies and 
more 
so the national assembly, the president called on the Somali 
people to speed up the formation of those assemblies which the 
world and all peace-loving people see as the only solution of 
reviving the nationhood of Somalia. The president further 
highlighted the way the 12 factions are fully involved in the 
faster formation of those assemblies in order to establish the 
interim national assembly and further called on our brothers the 
Somali National Alliance [SNA] and their supporters to be 
positive and flexible towards the peace calls by their brothers 
[the 12 factions], and if their [SNA] peace call is genuine, for 
them to participate in the formation of the assemblies, which is 
vital. 
  Today we are not in a position of confrontation and blaming 
each other but we are at the crossroads of reviving the 
nationhood of the Somali people, the president said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Finally, President Ali Mahdi Mohamed called on the Somali 
people wherever they may be to pray to God to bestow success and 
prosperity on Somalia in this year 1994.

  [Text] President Yoweri Museveni has warned that 1994 is 
very important in Uganda's political calendar and a lot is at 
stake. In a New Year message to the nation broadcast on radio 
Uganda and Uganda television, Mr. Museveni strongly advised his 
fellow countrymen not to allow their narrow interests to stand 
in the way of a smooth transition to a democratic elected 
government. He confirmed that a parliament and a president will 
be elected under the new constitution made by the people this 
year. He called upon all Ugandans to take the completion of the 
constitution-making exercise as seriously as they took the 
earlier phases of civic education and the submission of their 
views to the constitutional commission. "We must now complete 
the task we embarked upon more than four years ago and nobody 
should divert you at this 11th hour", he said. 
  He commended the commissioner of the Constituent Assembly 
elections and his staff for the civic awareness they have 
generated, which has made the registration exercise successful. 
He appealed to all Ugandans to take the Constituent Assembly 
elections very seriously so that they elect people who are 
committed to the nation and can competently debate the draft 
constitution, which is the compendium of the views of the people 
of Uganda, which they are at liberty to amend, add to, or 
subtract from through their representatives or directly. 
  On the question of having a level playing field, the 
president said the National Resistance Movement [NRM] government 
is committed to free and fair elections. However, he added: "We 
wish to appeal to the intending candidates not to tilt the field 
through the bribing of voters. The level playing field we all 
cherish", he went on, "will therefore very much depend on the 
behavior of the candidates." 
  He said government policy is to have the best men and women 
in the business of representing the people. On the future of 
the country the president said the democratic system we are 
building must be premised on peace and stability. We must 
therefore, he said, eschew the politics of division of the past 
and build political platforms on programs and not on ethnicity, 
religion or region. In that way, peace, stability, and 
democratic governance will take firm root in this country and 
become enduring. He said in the excitement and noise of the 
coming elections it will serve as well to remember the tortured 
history of our country since independence. He said institutions 
which we have always had and whose continuity some are 
advocating did not give us the peace and stability we all 
cherish. 
  Why should some people therefore, he asked, think that those 
self-same institutions and the people behind them who in the 
past have been the authors of chaos and tragedy can now lead us 
along the golden path? We now have an opportunity to put right 
the wrongs of the past. If we do not, he declared, history will 
condemn us. He reiterated the NRM policy of reconciliation, 
adding that Ugandans should never again be stampeded into exile 
on baseless grounds. 
  On the question of monarchs in Uganda, the president made it 
clear that the NRM government is not opposed to the restoration 
and formalization of any of our cultural institutions, provided 
the majority within the community concerned so desire. 
  On cooperation among the three east African countries: 
Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, president Museveni said the NRM 
government is fully committed to the revival and restoration of 
the historical links between the three countries to promote 
trade and common services. 
  On efforts being made to end minority rule in South Africa, 
President Museveni said Uganda hopes and prays that the forces 
of unity and reconciliation will prevail over disunity and 
hatred in the months ahead. 
  On the situation in Africa, the Ugandan leader said Africa 
has got one destiny and it cannot be realized until stability, 
peace and order prevail everywhere. We therefore earnestly call 
on the forces ranged against each other in fratricidal wars in 
the Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, and Angola to sheath their swords. 
  President Yoweri Museveni has said that in terms of economic 
performance, 1993 has been the brightest year for Uganda's 
economy since the early 1970's. In a New Year's message to the 
nation, Mr. Museveni said the last 12 months have been of 
prosperity, tranquillity and peace, and he declared we should be 
grateful to the Lord for all the blessings on our country. 
  He said over the last 12 months, the government has 
accelerated the pace of macroeconomic and structural reforms 
aimed at achieving increased stability and efficiency of the 
country's economy. The main elements in the strategy of 
maintaining macroeconomic stability, he added, are: firm control 
over public expenditure, keeping a tight lid on monetary 
expansion consistent with economic growth, and liberalization of 
the foreign exchange market, which has allowed increased foreign 
exchange inflows. 
  The president said that as a result of implementing this 
strategy, inflation has been brought under control. He 
disclosed that the rate of inflation dropped to 1.5 percent in 
November last year compared to 52 percent in November 1992. He 
promised that inflation will not be allowed to exceed 5 percent. 
The sharp fall in the rate of inflation has resulted in the 
reduction of interest rates. Due to these achievements, 
considerable private inflows, estimated at 241 million dollars 
in 1992/93, rose sharply, from 136 million in 1991/92. The 
president added that the government has been able to service its 
external debt obligations satisfactorily and has reduced its 
external debt arrears from 585 million dollars in June 1992 to 
253 million dollars in June 1993. 
  Mr. Museveni said, moreover, this has been achieved at a 
time 
when the country's external reserves at the Bank of Uganda are 
also increasing, reaching a level of 135.5 million dollars at 
the end of November 1993 from a level of only 60 million dollars 
in September 1992. And for the period July 1992 to June 1993 
our GDP is estimated to have grown by about 7.0 percent. 
  In the field of structural reforms the government has 
undertaken a number of measures. These include a return of over 
3,000 properties expropriated by the Idi Amin regime in the 
early 1970s to their owners. As a result of this action the 
country is beginning to see major rehabilitation and investments 
in properties repossessed by their owners, which has opened up 
opportunities for employment. Other measures taken are 
rationalization of public expenditure to improve services 
increasing the pace of divestiture reform of parastatals, and 
reform of the civil service through the restructuring of 
ministries, and the reduction of staff and the first phase of 
the reduction of the size of the Armed Forces has been completed. 
  He said in the New Year 1994, the government intends to 
pursue policies that will help us to consolidate macroeconomic 
stability. The government will accelerate the pace of the 
finance sector restructuring. In this connection Mr. Museveni 
said the government will intensify the restructuring of the 
Uganda Commercial Bank and cooperate [as heard] banks. He 
disclosed that early in the year the government will table in 
the NRC a non-performing loans recovery bill which seeks to 
clear the Uganda Commercial Bank of all non-performing loans 
from its balance sheet. The government will also sign a 
performance contract agreement with the Uganda Commercial Bank 
management: the government further intends to accelerate 
economic growth by improving the incentive framework for the 
private sector. 
  Accordingly, early in the year, the government will 
implement 
the following measures to reduce further the regulatory barriers 
to trade and investment: the cotton subsector will be 
revitalized through a change of policy relating to cotton 
production, ginning and marketing. The Ministry of Trade and 
Industry will to this effect table a cotton bill in the NRC 
early next month which aims at abolishing the lint marketing 
monopoly over exports and that of the unions over ginning. 
  The coffee subsector will be further liberalized through the 
implementation of the following measures: the requirements that 
coffee must be transported to ports by rail will be abolished. 
Exports will be free to choose the mode of transport for their 
coffee to the sea. The price formula used to calculate the 
export flow price will be abolished. The Ministry of Trade and 
Industry will announce the details in due course. The Uganda 
Coffee Development Authority, UCDA, statute will be amended to 
restructure its board so that the majority of directors 
represent the coffee industry and to define UCDA's role in the 
extension of coffee nurseries. The Coffee Marketing Board 
Limited, CMBL, will also be structured to reduce its operating 
costs to reflect current market realities. 
  Pump prices for petrol will be liberalized, and the minister 
of natural resources will announce the detailed measures that 
will accompany this policy. 
  The government will implement the final phase of the 
divestiture of the custodian board properties in 1994. In this 
regard the government will implement the following measures 
early in the year: return of remaining properties with valid 
repossession claims to their owners by the end of January 1994. 
The government will also sell all unclaimed properties by 
competitive tender beginning September 1994.

  [Text] The president of the National Assembly of Burundi 
and acting president of Frodebu [Front for Democracy in Burundi] 
party, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has paid a one-day working 
visit to Uganda at the invitation of President Yoweri Museveni. 
  Mr. Ntibantunganya, who was leading a high-powered 
ministerial delegation, was received at the airport by vice 
chairman of the NRM [National Resistance Movement] and the NRC 
[National Resistance Council], Al-Hajj Moses Kigongo, the 
Burundi ambassador to Uganda, Mr. Havyrimana, and other senior 
government officials. 
  From the airport, the Burundi delegation went to Lake 
Victoria Hotel, Entebbe, where they held talks with President 
Yoweri Museveni. The talks were also attended by the vice 
chairman of the NRC, Al-Hajj Moses Kigongo, and the director 
general of the Internal Security Organization, Brigadier Jim 
Muhezi. 
  A press release issued after the talks said the two 
delegations met in a brotherly and (?good) atmosphere and 
exchanged views on the current political situation in Burundi. 
The Burundi delegation briefed President Museveni on the 
political and security situation prevailing in Burundi and also 
the background to the crisis the country is going through. 
President Museveni reiterated his deep sorrow at the death of 
the late President Ndadaye, Pontien Karibwami, president of the 
National Assembly, and other high ranking officials of the 
Burundi Government. The Ugandan leader pledged his full support 
to all the people of Burundi in their efforts to re-establish 
peace and strengthen the process of democracy. The two 
delegations agreed to meet again as soon as possible to deepen 
their discussions on a date mutually convenient. 
  In an interview with the UGANDA NEWS AGENCY, UNA, 
correspondent at the airport before departure for home, Mr. 
Ntibantunganya expressed his gratitude to President Museveni for 
his concern for the people of Burundi and said he was confident 
that the Ugandan leader had the capacity and experience of 
handling problems like that of Burundi. He said he came to 
Uganda to seek advice in trying to find an institutional 
solution to the Burundi crisis which needed all political and 
social groups in the country to work together. 
  Mr. Ntibantunganya was later seen off by the NRM vice 
chairman, Al-Hajj Moses Kigongo, and other senior government 
officials.

  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- A witness to the attack on 
Cape Town's Heidelberg tavern which left three women and a man 
dead has described the incident as "sick". He said he had seen 
three girls in a corner of the pub "shooting up and down into 
the air like puppets" as they were being gunned down with 
automatic rifles. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reported the unnamed witness had walked into the pub to buy 
cigarettes and was busy chatting when he heard sounds resembling 
firecrackers. "I knew they were gunshots" he said, adding he 
"instinctively hit the deck". 
  "When I looked around everything was very quiet. But I heard 
the gunshots and I saw three girls in a corner going like 
puppets, shooting up and down into the air". He said people 
were running all over, hurrying outside, trying to get to their 
cars. 
  "Why did this happen in Observatory?" He asked. "I have been 
all over the country and Obs is such a peaceful place, very 
multiracial ...Why did they attack here?" "They were young 
people (the victims)...They keep talking about peace, peace, 
peace, but that's not peace. That was sick. I can't stop 
thinking about those three girls. I've seen action here, there 
and everywhere but this was different, because it was in my home 
town, right here. It's not fair," the witness said.

  [Text] Media Statement by the Government Spokesman 
  Reaction by the State President, Mr F W de Klerk, to 
  the Attack Last Night on an Observatory 
  Restaurant 
  The state president has learned with shock and horror of the 
attack last night on an Observatory restaurant in which four 
people were killed. 
  The identity of those responsible for the attack is not yet 
known. The state president has, however, given the assurance 
that the South African Police will use all their resources to 
track down the perpetrators and to bring them to justice. 
  The state president has emphasised that there can be no 
justification whatsoever for this barbaric deed. The 
representatives of the vast majority of South Africans have 
reached agreements that will soon lead to our first inclusive 
national elections and to the establishment of a truly 
representative government of national unity. The attack last 
night is evidently an attempt to destabilise this process. 
  The state president has called on all South Africans to 
resist any attempt to force them to deviate from this course and 
has urged them to stand united in their condemnation of violence. 
  He has conveyed his condolences to the family and friends of 
those who lost their lives in this shocking attack.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Law and Order Minister Hernus 
Kriel described the murders as callous, adding, the "sheer blood 
lust which marked this attack represents the kind of evil that 
must be relentlessly fought in the new South Africa". 
  "The fact that this attack took place during the festive 
season is evidence of the depths of depravity to which the 
perpetrators are prepared to sink in order to destabilise the 
democratic process. They must and they will be stopped. 
  "All South Africans must now unite and make the greatest 
possible effort to fight violence in all its forms. I appeal to 
the public to take every possible precautionary security measure 
to lessen the likelihood of such attacks. The South African 
Government and the SA Police remain as committed as ever to 
combating terrorism and every possible effort is being made to 
bring those responsible for this latest outrage to justice. 
  "I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the 
families and friends of the victims." 
  Condemnation of the attack also came from the African 
National Congress's Gill Marcus who told reporters she hoped the 
killers would soon be brought to book. "We condemn it as 
totally unacceptable... It's very difficult to understand the 
motives of people who commit random acts of terror."

  [Text] ANC Press Statement on the Attack 
  on the Heidelberg Restaurant, Cape Town 
  The attack on innocent civilians in the crowded Heidelberg 
restaurant in Cape Town must stand condemned by all who value 
democracy, peace and freedom in South Africa. 
  The loss of innocent life in such a cold-blooded manner is a 
grave indictment on our society. 
  Such acts of naked terrorism serve only the interests of 
those who want to destabilise negotiations and prevent free and 
fair elections. 
  As with all such attacks, whether they occur in the East 
Rand 
townships, in Natal or in the Cape, they must be immediately 
investigated and the perpetrators brought to book. 
  It is regrettable that there seems to be a different 
response 
when such attacks occur in townships as compared with those that 
occur where whites are victims. In townships, when taverns or 
homes are attacked, it is attributed to "black on black" 
violence or party political rivalry, and virtually dismissed as 
routine. We commend the police for their high-level response to 
this criminal act, and would like to see the same level and 
intensity of response in the other instances of violence that 
claim so many lives daily. 
  We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the 
three women and a man, as yet unnamed, who lost their lives. We 
wish the injured a speedy recovery. 
  The ANC will continue to do all in its power to bring an end 
to violence.

  [Text] Johannesburg Dec 31 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] on Friday called the late night shooting at a pub 
in Observatory, Cape Town, in which four people were killed and 
several injured, regrettable. 
  But the attack had to be seen "in the context of the daily 
carnage sweeping across our country, especially in the East Rand 
and the killing fields of Natal," said Deputy President Johnson 
Mlambo in a telephone interview with SAPA. "The PAC calls upon 
all our people to pay an equal value to all human life, 
regardless of skin colour." 
  Mr Mlambo said the PAC would continue to work hard for a 
mutual cessation of hostilities with the "regime". "We hope in 
the new year to extend our slogan of peace amongst the African 
people to apply to all who live in our country." 
  He added that the PAC did not know who was behind the 
attack.

  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] in the Western Cape on Friday condemned the "senseless 
attack on innocent people" at the Heidelberg tavern in 
Observatory shortly before midnight. 
  IFP Western Cape Chairman Alan Gibson and Vice-Chairman 
Lesley Langenhoven said they were "horrified" to hear of the 
attack in which four people lost their lives and others were 
wounded a few minutes before midnight. 
  They "implored" the people of Cape Town to assist the police 
in bringing "these murderers to justice". "We also ask those 
leaders of liberation movements to show respect for the victims 
by praying for them at home and not to use this incident for 
political gain while your members still retain their AK47's and 
limpet mines," they said. 
  Inkatha challenged liberation movements to hand in their 
"weapons of destruction now" and singled out the ANC [African 
National Congress] as being the most heavily armed group in the 
Western Cape region.

  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- Thursday night's terror 
attack on Cape Town's Heidelberg tavern should not be allowed to 
provoke decent people into taking revenge, Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu said on Friday. 
  Archbishop Tutu said the attackers, who left four people 
dead 
and five injured, were "agents of evil...who know they are on 
their last lap while the country progresses to freedom and 
peace", SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
reported. 
  The archbishop is a former recipient of the Nobel Peace 
Prize.

  [Text] Pretoria Dec 31 SAPA -- The shooting of innocent 
people in Cape Town was part of the carnage taking place 
countrywide, which had increased since implementation of the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC], AVF [Afrikaner National 
Front] spokesman Stephen Maninger said on Friday. 
  In its reaction to Thursday's night terror attack in Cape 
Town, the AVF called on the government and State President F W 
de Klerk to stop shadow-boxing with mere election statements, as 
though the country was in a peaceful election campaign. 
"Instead it should not evade its responsiblities to uphold law 
and order even if the TEC seems to have the de facto power," 
said Mr Maninger. 
  Government negotiator Roelf Meyer could use this opportunity 
to prove his past statements that implementation of the TEC did 
not rob the government of its power. "It is clear to us that 
since the TEC has come into effect there is a definite increase 
in violence. We believe that this is possibly the result of the 
fact that the same organisations actively conducting terror 
operations against political opponents are perhaps also playing 
a major role in the decision-making process within the TEC." 
  In view of the increasing violence, Mr de Klerk's recent 
electioneering attacks on his political opponents were not only 
pathetic and fake but reminded the AVF of Nero playing the 
fiddle while Rome was burning.

  [Text] Cape Town 31 Dec SAPA -- In a telephone call to SAPA 
on Friday afternoon, a Mr Zwaye Mfeya said he was the commander 
of the APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army] unit which 
attacked the bar just before midnight on Thursday, killing four 
people and wounding five. Mr Mfeya said he was phoning from 
central Cape Town. "The Afrikaner regime should expect more 
attacks. APLA confirms these operations will continue as long 
as our people don't have the vote...Ours is the vote for 
majority rule. APLA operations will continue as long as our 
people are being maimed and killed by the SA Defence Force and 
police." 
  SAPA was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of 
the 
claim. Mr Mfeya would give no more details of the attack other 
than those reported.

  [Text] Natal is to be targeted by the Azanian People's 
Liberation Army [Apla] this year, an Apla unit commander 
threatened in an exclusive interview. The commander, who asked 
to be labelled by his combat name of "Sizwe", said small attacks 
had already been carried out in the province and that more would 
follow, urging people to leave "Occupied Azania." 
  "In line with Apla's declaration that 1993 was the year of 
the great storm, Apla units in Natal will pounce on the enemy. 
The year will end with a thunder in Natal. This holiday will 
be a bloody one. All the tourists in occupied Azania must leave 
if they want to live." 
  Sizwe also threatened that the ANC's [African National 
Congress] armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, 
MK], could soon become a target of Apla. "If MK joins the 
peacekeeping force, then they will become legitimate targets."

  [Text] Umtata Dec 31 SAPA -- The Azanian People's 
Liberation Army [APLA] has declared 1994 the year of the great 
offensive on all fronts. In a New Year's message received by a 
SAPA correspondent in Umtata, APLA commander Sabelo Phama said 
on Friday the bullet and the ballot were to be used effectively 
in 1994. 
  Mr Phama said his organisation was concerned about decisions 
pertaining to security forces at the World Trade Centre. He 
said political power without military and economic power was 
empty and APLA should double its efforts both politically and on 
the military front. 
  The statement made no mention of the attack on a Cape Town 
pub around midnight on Thursday which killed four people and 
injured others. A caller purporting to represent APLA claimed 
in a telephone conversation with SAPA his organisation, the 
armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, was responsible for 
the attack.

  [Text] Johannesburg Dec 31 SAPA -- A second underground 
armed grouping has claimed responsibility for the late Thursday 
night attack on a Cape Town tavern. A caller purporting to be a 
member of the Azanian National Liberation Army [Azanla], armed 
wing of the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania, told SAPA in 
a telephone call on Friday that his movement had been 
responsible for the attack on the pub in which four people died. 
  Earlier, a man claiming to be a member of Azanian Peoples' 
Liberation Army [APLA] telephoned SAPA and said the Pan 
Africanist Congress' armed wing was responsible for the attack. 
  "They (APLA) must not claim responsibility for things they 
did not do," the purported Azanla caller said from a payphone. 
The man said he was calling from the southern Cape town of 
George. He identified himself as "Mobutu", the same name given 
by a caller who on Thursday telephoned various news 
organisations to claim responsibility for an explosion which 
damaged a block of flats in Port Elizabeth's Swartkops 
industrial area shortly after midnight on Tuesday. There were 
no injuries in that incident. 
  Shortly after the Tuesday blast, police found large amounts 
of explosives in several places at a block of flats in Algoa 
Park, about 15km from Swartkops. Officers said at the time 
police were investigating a possible link between the blast and 
the explosives seized. 
  The "Mobutu" caller told SAPA on Thursday the sabotage was 
part of Azanla's campaign for the complete liberation of all 
Azanians. "The struggle will continue until we are all free." 
  There was no way on Friday of independently confirming the 
caller was from Azanla.

  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- South Africa faced three 
challenges in 1994: democratic success, economic growth and to 
break out of past conflicts, State President F W de Klerk said 
in his New Year's message on Friday night. 
  December 31 marked more than the end of just another year. 
It also marked the end of an era, he said. 
  Next year South Africa would, for the first time, have a 
multiparty government that would be truly representative of all 
its people. "For the first time we will have a system where the 
constitution and the bill of rights -- and not politicians in 
Parliament -- will have the final say," Mr de Klerk said. 
  For the first time South Africa would have a constitutional 
system containing effective checks and balances against the 
misuse of power. 
  Important among these would be independent courts, including 
an independent constitutional court with wide-ranging powers. 
  Equally important would be the establishment of strong and 
autonomous provinces, with important powers and functions 
effectively entrenched. 
  Mr de Klerk said South Africa faced three challenges in the 
new year, the first being to let democracy succeed. "The second 
challenge...will be to make our economy work to the benefit of 
all our people. Success in the economic field will be as 
important as success in the constitutional field." 
  Democracy and elections would not by themselves bring all 
the 
things that people needed, said the president. "We will not be 
able to create jobs and build all of the houses, schools and 
clinics that we need, unless there is money to pay for them. 
And the only way that we can get this money is to ensure that 
our economy grows as quickly and as strongly as possible." 
  This would require hard work, new investments and expanding 
exports. "To achieve this, the new government of national unity 
will have to follow the right policies -- policies that have 
succeeded throughout the world." 
  "The third great challenge that we will face will be to 
build 
a new South African nation; to break out of the conflicts of the 
past; to break through to reconciliation," said Mr de Klerk.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Regional and Land Affairs Minister </F>
Andre Fourie, by South African Broadcasting Corporation 
presenters Eon de Vos and David Hall-Green, on the "Good Morning 
South Africa" program; passages in slantlines in English -- live] 
  [Text] [De Vos] Good morning and welcome to Good Morning 
South Africa. It is just after the news at eight [0600 GMT]. 
Earlier this morning we gave our viewers the opportunity of 
phoning in to discuss the purchase of a jet by the KwaZulu 
government. The amount mentioned is R[Rand]33 million. We have 
had several interesting opinions aired by viewers and in the 
meanwhile we have received a telephone call from Minister Andre 
Fourie, the Minister of Regional and Land Affairs, and he will 
also comment on this issue, concerning the jet purchased by 
KwaZulu. Good morning Minister Fourie. 
  [Fourie] Good morning. 
  [De Vos] Thank you for telephoning us. Firstly, what is the 
South African Government's view? 
  [Fourie] Well, let me first put the matter in perspective 
and 
I am thankful for this opportunity. You must understand that 
all the self-governing territories, including KwaZulu, are 
autonomous regional governments in terms of Act 21 of 71. They 
were on their way to independence in terms of the policy of the 
former government, so they have the full right and the full 
power to make any such decision. If there have been any misuse 
of funds, then there are several monitoring mechanisms to deal 
with this. They have their own Legislative Assembly to monitor 
spending. They have their own public accounting committee. The 
auditor general of South Africa can monitor spending and if 
funds are misused, then a report can be tabled in parliament. 
So there are several monitoring mechanisms. I really think this 
is a storm in a teacup, because in my opinion this is an asset 
and this asset will be handed over to a possible future 
Natal-KwaZulu regional authority or the South African 
Government. So this is not a loss for the taxpayer, it is 
actually a very good investment. 
  [De Vos] You talk about a storm in a teacup, a small amount, 
but Sunday papers mention a debt of more than R600 million. You 
mentioned that it is within their budget. What are we talking 
about? 
  [Fourie] Yes, you see this is typical of the SUNDAY TIMES 
and 
the ANC [African National Congress] trying to score by 
politicizing the issue. That 645 million rand debt is from 
loans to self-governing states through the Development Bank of 
Southern Africa. These are all capital expenditures -- for 
water and electricity supplies, all capital expenditure -- and 
they work on long-term loans and these loans are financed 
through their budgets. So this issue is totally out of 
perspective. 
  [De Vos] What about the view that they rushed to secure the 
deal before April, before things change? 
  [Fourie] Well I cannot comment on this because I don't know 
when the decision was made. I don't know when the order was 
placed, but as far as I am concerned the KwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly and the KwaZulu government will stay in power until the 
27 April, until the new constitution comes into effect. 
  [De Vos] Concerning the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] 
-- there is talk that the ANC will apply to the TEC to have the 
jet impounded. Now is the TEC empowered to do this? 
  [Fourie] I think this is absolutely laughable. I don't think 
they can impound the jet. They could inquire about this and 
then enter into discussion with the self-governing territory of 
KwaZulu, but I think for Gill Marcus and, especially Matthew 
Phosa ... [changes thought] It really surprises me, you know, 
that they can actually make such statements. Can I just give 
another perspective -- when I had to act against Lebowa, where 
they had an overdraft of R60 million and their budget deficit 
this year is expected to be over R400 million, then the ANC was 
dead quiet and did not say anything about this. But because this 
concerns Chief Minister Buthelezi and they want some sort of 
political gain, now they are fighting with him over R33 million. 
A R60 million overdraft -- that is debt. That is weak 
administration, money that cannot be recovered. This is an 
aircraft that has been bought. It is an asset and that asset 
remains in the government's possession or in the possession of a 
future regional government. I really think they are trying to 
score political points. 
  [De Vos] //A question from you, David.// 
  [Hall-Green] //Good morning Mr. Minister.// 
  [Fourie] //How are you David?// 
  [Hall-Green] //I am very well thank you and a happy New Year 
to you.// 
  [Fourie] //Same to you//. 
  [Hall-Green] //When the status of KwaZulu is changed, after 
the election in April, what is going to happen to this debt of 
roughly R650 million?// 
  [Fourie] //Yes, as I explained the R645 million debt, so 
called debt -- it is in long term loans which has been incurred 
through the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and obviously 
the new regional government for KwaZulu-Natal will take 
responsibility for that and a new government in that territory 
will have to make arrangements in terms of their budgets in the 
future, to pay those loans back to the Development Bank.// 
  [Hall-Green] //One of the callers who phoned in from 
Suurbekom this morning was very upset about this expenditure, 
saying that if you go through KwaZulu today and you look at the 
way the people live -- the lack of drinkable water, access to 
water and this kind of thing. Is this not an inflammatory thing 
to have done at this time?// 
  [Fourie] //Well that is a political question I think that 
Chief Minister Buthelezi and his cabinet will have to answer to. 
I can't reply to that. For them, they must make that political 
decision and they will have to explain that, both to their 
Legislative Assembly, and if necessary, also if the auditor 
general would like to investigate the matter, that's fine. Then 
they will be answerable to them. So I can't give you an answer 
in that regard. But as far as I am concerned it is not R33 
million down the drain, it is R33 million rand spent on an asset 
which any future government can dispose of, or use it in a 
proper manner in future.// 
  [Hall-Green] //Mr. Minister, thank you very much for phoning 
us this morning and putting your side of the story.// 
  [Fourie] //Thank you very much indeed.//

<F P=106> [Report by Roger Makings and Ray Hartley] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kwazulu took delivery of the British-built 
twin-engined Hawker 800 on Friday, just four months before the 
homeland will cease to exist on April 27. 
  According to calculations done by an experienced pilot, the 
new aircraft will cut flying time between Ulundi and major South 
African cities by between 10 and 46 minutes, but it will cost 
twice as much to operate as the turbo-prop King Air 300 -- owned 
by Kwazulu National Airways Corporation and used by homeland 
ministers. 
  A brief statement issued by the Kwazulu Finance Department 
this week defended the purchase of the aircraft as a 
cost-cutting exercise because it was cheaper than leasing. 
[passage omitted] 
  News that the aircraft deal had been concluded angered 
critics of Kwazulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The 
purchase was "massive and obscene" said ANC [African National 
Congress] Legal Department head Matthew Phosa. He called for a 
full investigation of Kwazulu's finances and told the SUNDAY 
TIMES the ANC would ask the TEC [Transvaal Indian Congress] to 
impound the aircraft when it reconvenes in mid-January. 
Democratic Party [DP] MP Peter Soal said it represented "a 
scandalous squandering of taxpayers' money." 
  Both the ANC and DP have called on Regional and Land Affairs 
Minister Andre Fourie to explain how debt-ridden Kwazulu -- 
which owed R[rand]645-million late last year and depends 
overwhelmingly on grants from the central government for its 
income -- obtained permission to buy the jet. Mr. Fourie could 
not be reached for comment late this week. 
  A Kwazulu spokesman said the aircraft -- which is painted 
white, green and gold -- would be handed over to the Natal 
regional government once the homeland was dissolved. [passage 
omitted]

Sunday there had been defections in the homeland's Defence Force 
to the African National Congress' military wing, Umkhonto We 
Sizwe (MK). Homeland defence chief Maj-Gen H S Turner branded as 
"cheap propanga" a CITY PRESS newspaper report on Sunday saying 
a 22-man detachment of MK members had been formed in 
Bophuthatswana. 
  The members, some of whom were allegedly involved in the 
abortive 1988 military coup to topple President Lucas Mangope, 
had defected from the homeland's army. 
  The "Bop Platoon" was introduced during the ANC army's 32nd 
anniversary celebrations in Krugersdorp recently. MK's western 
Transvaal Chief of Staff Kagiso Ramatlhoko said the group had 
undergone military training under the auspices of MK. He told 
CITY PRESS the unit was based in the homeland, but he declined 
to disclose its location for security reasons. 
  Gen Turner dismissed the report as a "sham story". "The 
Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] rejects allegations 
concerning the so-called defection of BDF members to the MK," he 
said. "The BDF considers the allegations cheap propaganda...It 
is again emphasised that MK activities in any form will not be 
tolerated in Bophuthatswana."

  [Text] Johannesburg Dec 31 SAPA -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] on Friday entered the fray over defecting members of the 
armed wing of the African National Congress [ANC], claiming many 
former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] cadres had 
"enthusiastically" joined the DP because of dissatisfaction with 
the ANC. 
  On Thursday the National Party made a similar claim which 
was 
dismissed by the ANC with "contempt and disgust". 
  On Friday Jack Bloom, the DP's southern Transvaal chairman 
of 
expansion, said he was not surprised former Umkhonto we Sizwe 
members were joining other political parties. "Throughout this 
year, a large number of former MK soldiers have enthusiastically 
joined the DP, invariably because of dissatisfaction over ill 
treatment by the ANC and misgivings at the real commitment of 
the ANC to democracy," he said. 
  He added: "The ANC must learn to accept healthy competition 
together with the fact that it is losing many members by its 
internal authoritarian practices. It is our information, in 
fact, that many nominal ANC members will cast their vote for a 
different political party once they are assured of the secrecy 
of the ballot. We believe that current defections to our own 
ranks are but the tip of the iceberg as far as support that will 
translated into votes on election day."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  De Klerk Loses White, Afrikaner Support -- The world is "in 
awe" that South Africa "could change so dramatically in less 
than four years without a shot being fired, without a revolution 
taking place, without civil war breaking out," declares the page 
6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 31 
December. Yet, "by acting swiftly, Mr de Klerk has not been 
able to take his people along with him, polls showing that he 
has lost White, and particularly Afrikaner, support. And by 
acting so quickly, he may have sparked a resistance that could 
endanger the whole carefully structured change to a new South 
Africa." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  National Reconciliation Major Task of Country -- "National 
reconciliation" will be the "major test" before South Africa in 
1994, says Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 3 January in a 
page 8 editorial. "Much progress" was made in 1993, but "with 
political violence leading to more than 3,000 deaths in 1993, a 
great deal of work remains to be done to bring peace to this 
country. Reconciliation is not, however, incompatible with 
political competition, provided the rivalry is tempered by 
tolerance and permeated by a democratic ethos. We do not want 
false reconciliation, a saccharine fraternity which denies 
differences." The African National Congress, ANC, has a "special 
responsibility" in the months ahead, because with its allies it 
is the "dominant political force and its influence is especially 
strong in the numerically important black community. The ANC's 
unofficial status as the government-in-waiting brings with it a 
proportionately heavy burden. By discharging it wisely, the ANC 
can help secure the future and facilitate fulfilment of its 
declared mission of reconstruction and reconciliation." 
  Labor Party Colored Adjunct to ANC -- Allan Hendrickse, the 
leader of the Labor Party, is "amply entitled to be sour about 
the Nats, whether or not his vitriol relates to an embarrassment 
over the pension his co-operation with the Nats has given him," 
says a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 
31 December. "But it was odd to use an (intended) valediction to 
virtually wish his party into oblivion. The Labour Party has 
become a kind of coloured adjunct of the ANC, not quite a real 
party, not quite a mere branch. It should make up its mind, and 
preferably it should decide to fight on its own right. Small 
parties should be allowed to flower." An alliance is good but 
"a real alliance requires two parties with two identities." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  1994 Promises Democracy, Challenges -- Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 3 January in a page 6 editorial says a new 
government must, among other things, "set in motion a long-term 
plan to disarm the country." This should be done by "tightening 
controls and imposing heavier penalties on people with 
unlicensed weapons." As important to the country will be the 
economic policies of the new government. "On monetary policy, 
the status granted to the Reserve Bank, given the ambiguous 
wording on the matter in the new constitution, will be the 
critical determinant of economic confidence. An independent 
Reserve Bank is crucial." Besides its economic policies, the 
new government will need to restructure the civil service, "if 
only to correct past racial imbalances. If that leads to 
appointments being made on merit, we score a bonus. If, 
instead, jobs are allocated as rewards for service to the 
'struggle', we face disaster." The year ahead promises a new 
democratic society, "but it also guarantees challenges which, 
depending on how they are met, will determine whether that 
promise materialises." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Pub Massacre Path to Civil War -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 3 January in a page 6 editorial refers to the weekend 
attack on a pub in Heidelberg, in which four people died and 
five were seriously injured, saying "It will be very easy for 
the perpetrators of this horror and their supporters to argue 
that blacks are dying daily in the political violence in this 
country and that the response is never as prompt and loud. They 
may argue that they are avenging those killed in the townships. 
This would be a puerile argument because, instead of solving 
the problem, it worsens it. The massacre is one step down the 
path to civil war." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Stronger Moderate Middle Ground Needed -- "The horror attack 
on defenseless civilians in a Cape Town tavern is a cruel 
contradiction to South Africa's so-called Year of Peace which 
began yesterday," says an editorial on page 16 of Johannesburg 
RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 2 January. "Judging from this atrocity, 
and similar earlier ones, and the continuing violence taking 
place on the Reef and in Natal in particular, there are clearly 
still segments of the population which do not see peace as the 
top priority in this election year. Brutal violence is still 
viewed by some as a necessary political instrument." The death 
of hundreds "underlines the fact that not everyone is committed 
to peaceful politicking within the framework of the new 
constitution. And the urgent talks with the Freedom Alliance in 
the days and weeks ahead confirm that those on the outside 
number more than just the roving bands of murderers." Of 
course, "not everyone can ever be bound by any new constitution, 
and for the foreseeable future there will be militants who will 
have to be held in check mercilessly. But atrocities such as 
the one in Cape Town conjure up a frighening specter of much 
more extensive violence if we fail to negotiate a more inclusive 
constitution on time." "For that reason all right-minded South 
Africans are focussing their hopes on the leaders involved to 
intensify and broaden even further their search for solutions, 
because we cannot afford the alternative." RAPPORT concludes: 
"One can rightly says that South Africa will stand or fall by 
the emergence of an even stronger moderate middle ground which 
will do everything to eradicate radical violence totally from 
our society."

<F P=106> [Article by Lorette Grobler: "Only 30 Percent of Black </F>
Matriculants Will Succeed"] 
  [Text] A large cloud of uncertainty is hanging over the 
final exams being taken starting on Monday by some 360,000 black 
students. 
  It is generally accepted that this year's success rate will 
be just this side of 30 percent. 
  Educational organizations agreed yesterday that the 
countrywide remedial review programs have done nothing to fill 
the gap. In most cases those programs died before birth because 
the teachers were already overworked and the students overloaded. 
  "There were a handful of teachers who offered extra morning 
classes, but in the majority of the cases the teachers were far 
too overloaded with work to be able to also offer any remedial 
programs," said Mr. Nkoane Maloka, regional coordinator for the 
South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU), yesterday. 
  Mr. Desmond Thompson, national information officer for the 
National Education Crisis Committee [NECC], corroborated this. 
"Operation Catch Up was not a success and students' morale is 
still very low." 
  Even the additional two weeks by which Mr. Sam de Beer, 
minister of education and training, delayed the final exams, did 
not help. 
  "The majority of the teachers were not even able to handle 
half of the study plan with the children. Students whose 
teachers did rush them through the study plan were not able to 
keep up with all the new information," said Mr. Maloka. 
  The circumstances are particularly difficult in schools in 
the Eastern Rand where students are afraid they might get shot 
while taking their exams. 
  "Perhaps there will not be any strikes now, but the 
situation 
is far from normal," stated Mr. Makola. 
  Mr. Thompson said that it does not do any good to be too 
enthusiastic about black education, which is on the brink of 
total collapse. 
  "Our only hope is that the new National Education and 
Training Forum will be more effective next year and that 
students will be able to take the exams over if they want to." 
  The Department of Education and Training was cautiously 
optimistic yesterday about what can be expected in the upcoming 
final exams. 
  "We hope that students have made the best of the additional 
two weeks available to them, but we would prefer not to make any 
predictions about the possible success rate," said Mr. Geoffrey 
Makwakwa, spokesperson for the department. 
  On Monday, the students will be taking typing and shorthand 
exams, and on Tuesday it will be history, French and several law 
courses. 
  Educational organizations expect that numerous students will 
be returning to school. Next year's classes will be even more 
overcrowded, with broader age differences among the students. 
The exams end on 30 November.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Super Strategy for the SAP"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the South African Police Force [SAP] 
announced a new strategy which it will henceforth use to fight 
violence and crime in the country. The foundation of this new 
strategy is community policing. The SAP will strive to make the 
nature of its policing in all respects community oriented. This 
is a report from our political editors. 
  The police force's new strategic plan includes seven focal 
points: Safety of the community; legitimacy of the police; 
training of the police; state of mind of the police; the optimal 
use of resources; adjustment to the new national allocation; and 
management skills-leadership of the SAP's management cadres. 
  As far as the safety of the community is concerned, the 
intent is to bring crime and violence to more acceptable levels 
and to restore a feeling of safety within the community through 
continuous presence, countrywide consultation forums between 
police and community, and optimal cooperation. 
  To this end, all available resources will be effectively 
activated in consultation with the community. Official 
structures will be expanded to ensure consultation and community 
involvement. Crime prevention and solutions to deeper problems 
of law and order will be given greater attention. And the 
overall policing authority of the police will be expanded. 
  The SAP's goal is to be an impartial, representative, and 
accepted community police service. 
  Therefore they want to establish a streamlined and community 
friendly policing style, to promote openness, to ensure the 
provision of equal services to all communities and the equal 
treatment of all individuals, to live up to a value system based 
on the principles of the police behavior code as included in the 
national peace agreement, to enhance the language skills and 
cultural sensitivity of its members, to maintain a sound and 
easily accessible complaint procedure, to not allow itself to be 
politically abused, and to be made up as representatively as 
possible. 
  The SAP's training must aim at being coordinated and in 
agreement with internationally accepted principles. This 
training must be geared toward competency, ability, professional 
and community need. 
  In order to improve the state of mind of the police, fear 
and 
political uncertainty will be tackled through better internal 
communication. Better and tougher discipline will also be 
implemented. The selection in hiring personnel will become more 
strict. Training will focus on positive attitude and human 
rights. And each member of the SAP will have to live up to the 
behavior code. 
  In order to achieve the best possible distribution and use 
of 
all available human, logistic and information resources to meet 
to the extent possible the policing needs of the community, a 
good computerized management information system will be 
implemented. The subjects of management courses will be adapted. 
  The SAP will also ensure that it will be efficiently and 
fully included in the new national model and that its policing 
will function effectively and acceptably within such a new 
national model. 
  To this effect a continuous restructuring and positioning of 
the SAP in accordance with national changes, and a review and 
adjustment of laws, regulations and prescriptions in accordance 
with these changes will be necessary. 
  The strategy is also aimed at the professional training of 
all police officers so that they will have the necessary skills 
and abilities to ensure that they will provide an acceptable 
communi ty oriented service. 
  In order to achieve this, a representative management body 
must be entrusted with the maintenance of standards. Skills will 
be developed through transitional programs. All members of the 
SAP, but especially management personnel, will be encouraged to 
better equip themselves academically. 
  In order to create a favorable climate for the development 
of 
this strategy, the SAP has committed itself to: 

  -  Recognize the basic rights of all people; 
  -  Protect/secure the community by providing quality service; 
  -  The principle of responsibility toward the community; 
  -  Impartiality and credibility; 
  -  Provide speedy, simple and professional services; 
  -  Proactive action and maintenance of initiative; 
  -  Consultation with the community, negotiation and a 
participatory style of managment; 
$And to respect the needs of the community. 
  This strategy was developed by the governing board of the 
SAP 
in consultation with the Police Council following a 
determination of the needs of the broader community. 
  This will be available to the public for perusal at all 
police stations. 
  The Police Council functions under the leadership of Mr. 
Johan van Vuuren, former head of ARMSCOR. A variety of groups 
from the broader comunity is represented in it.

<F P=106> [Article by military correspondent Marga Ley: "`No Question' </F>
of Split Within the SADF (South African Defense Forces"] 
  [Text] There is no question of either dissension or a 
possible split within the Defense Forces. 
  General Kat Liebenberg stated yesterday in Pretoria that the 
Defense Forces are apolitical and do not belong to either the 
National Party, the Conservative Party or any other party or 
movement. 
  During a spectacular parade at Voortrekkerhoogte of a 
brigade 
of soldiers belonging to the four separate Defense Force 
services, with several overflights, parachute jumps and a canon 
salute, Gen. Liebenberg handed over the command of the South 
African Defense Forces (SADF) to Lieutenant General Georg 
Meiring. 
  "The structure and culture of the Defense Forces do not 
allow 
for such dissension," said Gen. Liebenberg. 
  The parade was attended by, among others, General Constand 
Viljoen, a former head of the Defense Forces and currently one 
of the leaders of the Afrikaner National Front (AVF). 
  Yesterday, the AVF called on its supporters to fight to 
achieve self-determination. 
  Following the parade, Gen. Viljoen said that he hoped that 
South Africa would never reach the point where the SADF is given 
the task to take action against the right wingers. 
  Gen. Liebenberg asked politicians and the media to respect 
and uphold the apolitical character of the SADF as an 
institution and the soldier in uniform for their own sake and 
that of the country's. 
  He warned organizations, institutions and individuals who 
are 
striving to chip away at and besmirch the SADF that they may yet 
have to rely on those forces for their protection and security, 
their own survival and the orderly survival of the country. 
  In addition, he also warned that the SADF and the defense 
industries have already been cut to the bone by far reaching 
cuts and rationalization. 
  "If more cuts are implemented, then the nerves will be bared 
to the core, with disastrous consequences." 
  He also pleaded that standards must be maintained within the 
SADF and that the SADF must always hang on to its professional 
nature. 
  "The situation cannot be allowed where someone who exercises 
command over the lives of soldiers would not be adequately 
trained or adequately qualified or lack the necessary experience 
and military knowledge." 
  Gen. Lieberberg also pleaded for the maintenance of 
part-time 
forces. "Whatever changes may occur in the new system, the 
part-time forces may never be allowed to become the stepchildren 
of the Defense Forces," he said. 
  The parade was also attended by other politicians. Mr. Kobie 
Coetsee, minister of defense, was present as well as Mr. Hernus 
Kriel, minister of law and order, who initially sat next to Gen. 
Viljoen before taking his place on the front honor seats.

<F P=106> [Interview in the column "One-on-One" with Col. Johan </F>
Burger, chief of Negotiation Strategy in the South African 
Police Force's Community Relations Department, by Andriette 
Stofberg: "Col. Johan Burger Is Not Afraid To Speak His Mind: 
Police Force Must Be Demilitarized Soon"; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] "Today we bravely say things which would have been 
unthinkable a few years ago. I believe that it is to our 
advantage that this has become possible." 
  Colonel Johan Burger does not seem like such a "liberal" 
police man. Sitting behind his desk in Pretoria, he looks just 
like any other very ordinary policeman. 
  It is only that this chief of negotiation strategy within 
the 
Community Relations Department has quietly acquired a reputation 
within and outside the police force as someone who is not afraid 
to say things which used to be better left unsaid. 
  When in 1971, as a very young policeman, he was hunting 
terrorists far away in the Caprivi strip, he did not have too 
much to say. He did not even ask questions. Besides, like so 
many other policemen there, he did not even know who or what 
SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] was. 
  "We did not receive any political training. We were not 
politically aware. We were only taught that we were there to 
shoot terrorists. We did not know what they stood for. We only 
knew that they were in the process of causing some kind of drama 
or other." 
  Then came the disturbances of 1976. The small seed, which 
would lead to his starting to ask questions, was sowed. He was a 
member of the riot squads. "I imagined myself in the shoes of 
the black men, and wondered how I would have felt if Afrikaans 
had been forced upon me." 
  In 1982, when he was riding around in Owambo "with a Casspir 
and a gun," he started asking questions in earnest. 
  About such things as why the police force had moved so far 
away from its traditional role of a doctrine of "search and take 
into custody," after having so successfully made the military 
"search and destroy" doctrine of a semimilitary organization its 
own. 
  One of the results of these questions was a Master of 
Strategic Studies dissertation last year at UNISA [University of 
South Africa] about the role of the police in counterinsurgency 
in Namibia. 
  He believes that it is necessary for the police force to 
become demilitarized as soon as possible and that it must once 
again become a civilian police force. The military character of 
the police force has developed over many years--first through 
participation in two world wars and then in the 
counterinsurgency war along the border. 
  "I believe that we should have withdrawn sooner as the 
struggle became more military in character. Of course, the 
police force has a role to play in counterinsurgency actions. 
But there comes a point when the involvement of the military 
becomes so great that they should play the primary role. Then 
the police force must stand back." 
  "What has happened in our country is that instead of the 
police force standing back, we joined. Sometimes we were more 
soldiers than the soldiers themselves." 
  "This inherently created problems for us. Take a policeman 
who had returned from the border and had to come to police the 
townships, can you imagine what his approach was? After all, he 
had been conditioned like a soldier." 
  "Now we must change our own approach to our own culture. And 
this is hard to accept for many policemen--given the pride we 
have in our history. However, the question remains: was it good 
for us to have become militarily involved to such an extent? Is 
this the right kind of background to have for normal policing 
work?" 
  "We have been trained like a semimilitary organization. In 
addition to the fact that South Africa has never had a culture 
of human rights in its constitution or in any other laws, we did 
not have this in the police force either. We are the product of 
our own society." 
  "Now that society is changing, we must recognize that we 
must 
do the same thing. We are already in the process of implementing 
major changes. An international team of experts is helping us to 
adjust our training, with a particular emphasis on the new 
community policing approach, and also because we need a better 
under standing of negotiating tactics to defuse situations--that 
the guys should not be so quick to turn to violence." 
  Like any other people in the country, policemen must find 
their bearings within the changes which are taking place in the 
national and other arenas. 
  As part of his job, Col. Burger has developed a consequence 
leap model which he uses in informational sessions to try to 
explain to policemen all over the country how the national 
negotiations affect the Police force. 
  "It says to the guys on the other side of the negotiation 
process that there will stil be a South Africa, there will still 
be a police force, there will still be a structure, there will 
still be laws. Things will just look a little different. You 
have to make a psychological leap to that point from where you 
are now. Then things will not seem so confusing to you and you 
will large ly lose your fear of the future." 
  "Of course, you will still be uncertain because nobody can 
see into the future. But you have to realize that it will be 
incredibly difficult for you, if not impossible, to be 
physically a policeman in the new South Africa if 
psychologically you have remained behind in the old South 
Africa." 
  He talks about the major confidence crisis which exists 
between the police and primarily the black community. 
  "Take such factors as the so-called apartheid heritage. 
Nobody argues about it anymore: apartheid had certain negative 
consequences and the police force was not untouched by them. We 
have had a certain power approach within the police force. I do 
not mean all policemen, but in many cases policemen did not have 
any interest in the community, especially not the black 
community." 
  "We simply used the approach that this is what the law said, 
the law was rigidly enforced and we did not tolerate any 
opposition. Good relations were not important to us. What was 
important was to enforce the law as it stood." 
  "Opposition to this also hardened the policemen's 
disposition. Later on, we no longer had any sympathy for the 
victims of cer tain laws--however unfair they may have 
been--because for us it was a question of doing a job that had 
to be done." 
  The hardening of feelings on both sides between the 
community 
and the police force led to alienation. After February 1990, 
however, the police began to realize that they had to reach out 
to heal the alienation. 
  "But this goes together with the legitimacy of the 
government. As long as we do not have a legitimate government, 
the police force cannot be legitimate." 
  "Legitimacy is defined by the whole population of a nation. 
The police force is currently not legitimate because today's 
government, of which we are an extension, only represents part 
of the population. If the body is dead, there is no way an arm 
can be alive." 
  "We are trying, through the community policing approach, to 
achieve a greater degree of acceptance. But this is only 
secondary. All these positive things will not mean a thing until 
the government itself, the primary source, has achieved 
legitimacy."

  [Text] People allegedly linked to the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] today attacked the 
Malongo oil complex, 30 km north of the city of Cabinda, 
according to an unofficial military source in Luanda. The 
source added that the staff at the complex, run by the American 
company Chevron, were evacuated to the sea, from where they 
contacted their relatives in Luanda by phone. Without giving 
any more details, the source said this was the first military 
incident in Cabinda involving a foreign company. The Malongo 
complex is the most important in the country, accounting for 60 
percent of the oil exploration in Angola. According to the 
source the attack took place in mid-morning. The staff were 
evacuated to the high sea and no one was killed. Despite 
various attempts, it has been impossible to get confirmation of 
this attack from the Chevron offices in Luanda or in Cabinda, as 
they are closed. 
  In the meantime, the same source also said that UNITA and 
the 
Angolan Armed Forces have been fighting in Malanje.

  [Text] There are reports of an attack against an American 
oil installation in the northern Angola. A spokeswoman for the 
oil company, Chevron, which runs the operation at Malongo, said 
three mortar bombs landed in the base, slightly injuring one 
person and damaging two vehicles. The Portuguese News Agency 
quoted Angolan military sources as saying the attack was 
possibly carried out by forces linked to the UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebel movement, but 
the UNITA spokesman at the United Nations, Marcos Samondo, said 
he knew nothing about the attack.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda on 30 </F>
December -- recorded] 
  [Text] Angolans, Excellencies: 
  Another year is about to end and yet the longed for peace is 
not present in every home and in the hearts of Angolans as a 
whole. The war continues, carrying in its midst destruction, 
grief, misery, and suffering to millions of Angolans. 
Nonetheless, I believe the situation will soon be overcome 
because our people have always been able to resolve their 
problems by themselves, however big the obstacles and the 
difficulties they face. On this occasion, which should be one 
of joy for all, I would like to convey a message of comfort and 
hope to all those who have been forced to leave their homes or 
live in locations and provinces occupied by National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops. I refer in 
particular to the war orphans. I would also like to salute 
Angolan and international organizations for everything they have 
done to relieve the suffering of those Angolans. 
  We are all aware that for legitimate reasons, the government 
has not been able to fully implement the program of action of 
the party that won the September 1992 elections. In practice, 
that program has been replaced by specific measures of an 
emergency nature designed to minimize major shortcomings. 
Although one still sees a degree of slackness on the part of 
certain government officials over the implementation of urgent 
tasks that have been planned, I am confident that the situation 
will be overcome, and that the government will be more efficient 
to ensure a better performance of the country's political and 
socioeconomic sectors. It is imperative that our government 
continues to ensure the functioning of democratic institutions, 
self-defense operations against UNITA's military forces, and to 
promote effective productive measures, giving priority to those 
sectors that cater for the basic social requirements of the 
people. 
  In addition to other parties and political forces, the 
government has the great responsibility of organizing, 
encouraging, and mobilizing citizens for productive work as a 
precondition for the effective enhancement of their salaries, 
and improvement of their living conditions. To achieve that, we 
need capable and active cadres because the successful 
implementation of the socioeconomic development program for 1994 
depends on them. This program calls for effective work and the 
socioeconomic enhancement of Angola as a whole, particularly the 
areas of greater potential. The implementation of that program 
is linked to the strengthening of the state's democratic 
authority, the structural adjustment of the economy, and the 
integration of Angolans into the national economy which is now 
market orientated. In so doing, Angolans will be assured of 
their social and economic upliftment, thus promoting real growth 
for the stability of the country. In that context, agriculture 
will be the basis of food security and economic growth. 
Petroleum and mining will finance development, and education and 
health will be the conduit for professional training and social 
participation of citizens in the development process. This is a 
challenge that the government ought to be able to accomplish as 
soon as possible. 
  Other issues like the privatization of property, land 
utilization, housing, and construction and related materials 
will also require the government's great attention so that the 
policies to be adopted and the tasks to be accomplished suit the 
strategic interests of the state and the needs of the people. 
The process of economic transformation will continue with a 
view to favoring private initiative. That, however, does not 
mean that the state should withdraw completely from the 
productive economic sector. The state ought to be capable of 
either replacing or complementing private initiative when the 
latter shows no interest in less attractive activities, but 
which are essential for development. Obviously, the scope and 
complexity of those and other tasks call for an efficient, 
operational, and sound government, as well as an efficient 
public administration. It is, therefore, imperative to redefine 
the policy on cadres and salaries, while continuing to introduce 
indispensable changes to overcome stagnation and indiscipline. 
  In tandem with the implementation of the socioeconomic 
development program and other urgent measures covering the 
various sectors, the organization of the armed forces and of the 
security and internal order services ought to be stepped up. It 
is only in an atmosphere of calm and social peace that the 
government can continue to implement the emergency measures 
designed to halt the worsening of the situation and to create 
conditions to reactivate economic development on a short-term 
basis. Over the past year the police general command made a 
praiseworthy effort to purge its ranks of undesirable and 
pernicious elements. Despite material shortcomings and the 
difficult living conditions of many of the command's staff 
members, I urge it to continue with the purging of such elements 
from the police ranks. The people want an organized, loyal, 
disciplined, and vigilant police that ensure tranquility of 
citizens, and see to it that social and private property is 
protected. 
  The new Angolan armed forces have brilliantly accomplished 
their mission. I am convinced that they will continue to defend 
our people by holding on firmly to their positions on the ground 
and preventing further advances by UNITA's military forces. The 
Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Armed Forces 
should, therefore, continue with their efforts to organize and 
discipline the Angolan Armed Forces, seeing to it that their 
equipment and personnel are better controlled, and that the 
National Assembly approves the legislation required for the 
strengthening of their role. 
  Excellencies, there can be no lasting solutions to the 
current crisis unless they are followed by the creation of an 
atmosphere of peace and national reconciliation. That is the 
ultimate goal of the ongoing Lusaka talks. In its strategic 
agenda for the resolution of the postelectoral crisis, the 
government still believes that the Bicesse Accord is the legal 
and political framework, and the relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions the international legal and political basis of the 
Angolan peace process. 
  So, I feel that only the demilitarization of UNITA, the 
fulfillment of outstanding aspects of the Bicesse Accord, and, 
as a consequence, national reconciliation are the fundamental 
premises that guarantee peace and the country's stability. In 
addition to that, there ought to be adherence to the principle 
of respect for democracy by acknowledging the power of law as 
legitimized by the people's verdict during the 29-30 September 
1992 elections. These have resulted in power being legally in 
the hands of the majority, with the rights of the minority being 
respected. 
  That experience has taught us that the factors leading to 
the 
collapse of the Bicesse Accord included, in addition to UNITA's 
bad faith, the profound mistrusts between the sides, the 
extremely short timetables for the execution of essential tasks, 
the lack of a budget to cover expenditure, the lack of resources 
to finance all the operations, and the inadequate personnel of 
the UN Angola Verification Mission-2. 
  New efforts should be made to avoid the same situation once 
the Bicesse Accord is revived and implemented. So, it is 
indispensable that we define realistic timetables for the 
planning and execution of organizational, political, and 
material tasks to be carried out by the government, the United 
Nations, and the international community to ensure the 
implementation of the future political commitments to be made by 
the government and UNITA. The international community ought to 
be aware of the costs and logistical difficulties posed by every 
aspect of a peace operation in Angola and should take steps to 
give its contribution. 
  Obviously, the government will not evade its 
responsibilities. In its plan of action, the government will try 
to consider every aspect of promoting stability and harmony in 
the country. I think that the Angolan people will also give 
their support when the time comes. The great political 
awareness that the majority of our people have already shown 
will once again permit them to distinguish between fair 
solutions and measures that are useless and serve only to 
promote chaos and anarchy. 
  We will continue our efforts to find a fair and lasting 
solution to the Angolan dispute, but while that does not come 
about, I urge you to be vigilant, to be even more committed to 
the upholding of democracy, freedom, and the interests of the 
Angolan people. Let us put aside all the artificial factors 
that have led to misunderstanding and mistrust and begin the new 
year, bearing always in mind the sacred values of national unity 
and love for the fatherland. United, our people will win. 
United, our people will fulfill their dream of peace and 
prosperity. A happy new year. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address to nation by UNITA President Jonas Malheiro Savimbi </F>
on New Year's eve -- recorded] 
  [Text] Angolan men, Angolan women, compatriots, proved 
militants of our glorious movement, the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], members of the UNITA armed 
forces, on this first day of 1994, I have the solemn duty to 
address the entire nation in order to be able to explain in a 
firmer, more precise, and in greater detail what we feel are the 
reasons for the situation we are currently experiencing in our 
beautiful country and the measures that UNITA intends to adopt 
so that peace may once again reign throughout the national 
territory. 
  First of all, we would like to declare to the entire Angolan 
people that our desire to reach an agreement with the government 
led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] 
is serious. Our commitment to peace is also very serious. We 
would like, before anything else, to also clarify that there is 
an infernal disinformation machine mounted in complicity with 
the MPLA, and for the MPLA, to convince the Angolan people and 
the international community that UNITA took up arms because it 
lost the legislative elections in September 1992. 
  All the Angolan people know and nobody should forget that 
the 
results of the 1992 legislative elections were announced on 17 
October 1992, but armed clashes only began in November 1992, 
after the massacres which took place in Luanda. We would like 
to point out without ambiguity that the reason for the war that 
is currently being waged in the country is not because we 
contested the results of legislative elections held in September 
1992. What caused this war is UNITA's moral and civic duty to 
defend itself from the elimination designed for it by the MPLA 
because of the MPLA's (?hatred) and [word indistinct] toward our 
movement. It is not very easy for us to forget the memory of 
our ever-missed Vice President Jeremias Kalandula Chitunda, a 
(?firm negotiator). We cannot forget the memory of our 
Secretary General Adolosi Paulo Mango Alicerces and Engineer 
Elias Salupeto Pena, who was the head of our representation to 
the Joint Political and Military Commission [CCPM]. 
  What is more, the massacres continued in Novo Redondo, 
Benguela, Lobito, and Lubango. We experienced treacherous 
attacks in Huambo, Bie, Menongue, Malange, Ondjiva, Luena, and 
Saurimo. All this forced us to try with all the resources at 
our disposal, no matter how few they were, to defend our 
populations, our militants, and sympathizers. All of you also 
know that (?there was a desire) to make the first multiparty 
elections in the country transparent; but from registration to 
voting processes, we witnessed only unrestrained manipulation by 
the MPLA. Already in August 1992, the MPLA [words indistinct] 
the winner, and asked the UNITA leadership to subscribe to a 
document in which our party accepted the results of the 
elections which had not yet been held. They were very sure of 
victory. 
  The catastrophe came, however, when Ms. Margaret Anstee 
declared the elections to be free and fair. After [words 
indistinct] months, the same lady says that she did not have the 
resources to organize and observe the elections. This is what 
she should have said on the occasion. Only after having plunged 
our country in [word indistinct], the lady says that of the two 
[words indistinct] one was doubtful and [words indistinct]. 
  Those who took part in manipulating the election results are 
now confronted with a conflict whose end is completely 
unforeseen. As is always the case in history, there must be 
scapegoats. The scapegoat in the present national crisis is 
UNITA. There is a witness, however, who does not forget -- the 
Angolan people themselves [words indistinct]. 
  Despite all this, we took upon ourselves the serious 
responsibility to accept the results of these elections. There 
is a major problem, however, in the legal framework emerging 
from these elections -- there is a lack of moral strength to 
understand, to forgive, (?to work), and to reconcile the Angolan 
nation whose fabric was damaged by much [words indistinct]. 
  The MPLA regime has been desperately sticking to the 
principle of sovereignty, even when its police (?steals), 
violates, and humiliates common citizens, [words indistinct], 
and many Angolans today [words indistinct]. The MPLA propaganda 
is only aimed at oppressing the people. It is equally aimed at 
[words indistinct] the international community regarding its 
real intentions. All the same, we think that the MPLA 
propaganda's effectiveness is already reaching its end. [Words 
indistinct] we in UNITA think that they remain the only [word 
indistinct] judges [words indistinct] our own conscience and our 
people themselves. The others are just messengers, carrying 
messages, as we have seen them do for over 15 years. What UNITA 
is worried about is the constant resort to weapons. What UNITA 
is worried about is the existence of political, economic, and 
social differences among the Angolan people. 
  Thirty-three years of war for a people and for an African 
country are too much. The African culture believes in dialogue 
and not in a constant resort to violence. It is for this 
reason, and it is not a minor reason, that we are committed to 
peace. We believe, however, in a true peace which demands 
concrete and real actions. The Angolan people know today that 
as part of its contribution to peace, UNITA has taken the 
following steps forward: 
  It accepted the results of the elections held in September 
1992. It accepted the Bicesse Accords as a foundation for 
discussions. It accepted the Abidjan Protocol and the many 
resolutions approved by the UN Security Council against [words 
indistinct]. What is more, UNITA unilaterally declared a 
cease-fire [words indistinct] which permitted the resumption of 
negotiations and the sending of humanitarian assistance to needy 
people. 
  In addition, all the concessions made in Lusaka were made by 
UNITA. At the present period, the cease-fire is already 
(?real), and the formation of the Angolan Armed Forces has been 
accepted, as well as all the consequences resulting from there. 
  What are we seeing on the side of the MPLA, however? We are 
seeing a very serious (?desire) to eliminate UNITA militarily 
and to transform our glorious party into an instrument [words 
indistinct] of what we are, where we came from, and where we are 
going. What is more, the MPLA regime has not yet learned to 
coexist with other parties. Accordingly, it concerns us to see 
a party that was officially recognized by the MPLA Supreme 
Court, the Democratic Party for Progress of the Angolan National 
Alliance [PDP-ANA], infiltrated today, because its president who 
has been an authorized voice of a true opposition [words 
indistinct]. 
  Over the last 18 years, we have seen many ploys by the MPLA 
government to try and create a new UNITA: UNITA B, UNITA C, 
UNITA E. None of those UNITA's has survived because there is 
only one UNITA and it has its own philosophy, its own 
objectives, and wants to contribute with its role and with its 
own [word indistinct] (?suffering) to the building of a strong 
and united Angola, which is, however, [words indistinct]. All 
attempts to create a new UNITA are bound to fail. 
  Furthermore, the MPLA has lately embarked on a 
disinformation 
campaign concerning possible UNITA military [word indistinct], 
the sole aim of which is to disguise the MPLA's undoubted desire 
to militarily eliminate all its opponents. [Words indistinct] 
in the cover of democracy, a one-party regime for many long 
years. This kind of democracy does not promote us. What is 
more, it does not [words indistinct]. 
  The UNITA delegation to the Lusaka peace talks will leave 
today, 1 January 1994, with the firm desire to meet with the 
MPLA. Those who tried to speculate that UNITA would not leave 
for Lusaka have erred yet again. We leave two days earlier so 
that the Angolan people and also the international community can 
see that we want to hold serious discussions and that we want to 
find solutions within a legal, political, and administrative 
framework which will guarantee peace, the tranquility of the 
people to promote economic and social development for the 
well-being of all Angolan people. 
  What is more, we are realistic. If we cannot [words 
indistinct] we should at least reach a general cease-fire so 
that with the silencing of weapons, (?civilians) can [words 
indistinct] but this time, we are not going to Lusaka [words 
indistinct]. We would like a cease-fire that will allow 
humanitarian organizations to continue to assist people affected 
by famine, disease, and nakedness. UNITA would be ready to sign 
such a cease-fire immediately. Perhaps it is very difficult for 
the MPLA, which has purchased arms to assume the same attitude 
of transparency, clarity, and [words indistinct]. 
  During the coming round of talks, UNITA [words indistinct] 
political and administrative throughout the country since this 
balance was seriously thwarted by the Luanda massacres. That is 
why, [words indistinct] since we shall no longer accept [words 
indistinct] guarantees. We cannot repeat the (?mistakes) [words 
indistinct]. 
  Furthermore, our delegation [words indistinct] to reach 
viable and verifiable agreements. We would also like to ask UN 
mediators not to treat Africans (?as inferiors). It pains me to 
say that, with so many conflicts in the country, so many 
conflicts in the world, so many conflicts on the continent, 
there are [words indistinct] but there is always a time for 
discussion and a time for reflection. There are many conflicts 
on the African continent, as the conflicts that are now emerging 
in Eritrea, the Sudan, the Congo, Sierra Leone, and other parts 
of our beautiful continent bare witness. There has always been a 
time for discussion and time for reflection. 
  In the case of Angola, timetables of slavery have been 
imposed on us, however. This was the case in Bicesse. It was 
the case in Abidjan, and it was also the case in Lusaka 
recently. This behavior does not only detract from the prestige 
of the mediation because it is a behavior that is adopted only 
toward Africans, but the world is experiencing conflicts such as 
the one existing in Bosnia, conflicts between Israel and 
Palestine, [words indistinct] discussions, a break for 
reflection and the resumption of discussions. I profoundly 
regret such behavior which makes Africans inferior beings. No 
one can doubt UNITA's [words indistinct] political problems, 
problems arising from a newly born democracy, economic problems, 
but we continue to believe in the destiny of our continent. 
After we have learned, we shall one day know [words indistinct]. 
  We would like to take this opportunity to thank the patience 
shown by UN Special Representative Dr. Alioune Blondin Beye, who 
has never spared any efforts to try and bring UNITA and the MPLA 
together. We would also like to remember a great African [words 
indistinct] the principles of African culture. It is not by 
negotiating under (?duress) [words indistinct] dialogue must be 
[words indistinct] but firm. Dialogue must be [word indistinct] 
but determined. Dialogue must be intelligent but also [words 
indistinct] that we Africans find solutions to our various 
problems. 
  We would also like to express our gratitude for the role 
played by the peace process observers. They have tried by all 
means to find [words indistinct] the MPLA government and UNITA. 
We also think that the United States, Portugal, and Russia have 
an important role to play in the peace negotiations in Angola. 
  I would also like -- since circumstances so dictate [words 
indistinct] -- to say a word about Portugal. UNITA hopes that 
in 1994 our relations with the Portuguese Government will 
improve, for the interest of our peoples [words indistinct]. 
Our relations have been very difficult. This has greatly 
hampered the negotiating process in Angola. We have a common 
language, culture, and [word indistinct] but, Africans that we 
are, we should not be penalized for trying to defend our values. 
At this stage, we are [words indistinct] of Angola. Portugal 
has an important card to play so we can find an agreement [words 
indistinct] at least try to arrive at an understanding with 
UNITA. It has an ambassador in Luanda and it has a great 
capacity to talk. 
  Other European countries, notably France, Germany, Belgium, 
the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy, should not in any way 
encourage the MPLA to follow unjust paths, because, by selling 
weapons to the MPLA and giving economic support to Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos -- who is still a candidate in the second round of 
presidential elections -- they only make the MPLA more 
intransigent, more radical and [words indistinct] with little 
desire to make concessions. 
  Peace is the overriding interest both to the Angolan people 
and to the other countries concerned about Angola [words 
indistinct] UNITA [words indistinct] attitudes that were [words 
indistinct] we also share a common background, culture, and 
language with Brazil. We hope that relations with Brazil will 
improve in 1994. 
  Regarding the United States, now that the USSR has become a 
conglomerate of countries, it is up to the United States to 
guarantee peace for all, whether they be big or small. The 
UNITA team will hold constant contacts with Holden Roberto, 
president of the Angola National Liberation Front 
representative, brother Daniel Julio Chipenda, Engineer Catete, 
and all opposition leaders who are abroad because the issue of 
peace is not a matter that only concerns UNITA. It concerns 
all the Angolan people, all of us. It is not because [words 
indistinct] in 1992 that UNITA [words indistinct]. 
  To all Angolans, to the proven militants: We have passed the 
thorny path of 1993. The year of 1994 shall be known as the 
year for thinking about our African identity and it will lead to 
new gains, the greatest of which shall be peace. Peace will be 
built with UNITA and peace will not [words indistinct] UNITA. 
  To all the Angolan people, to all our militants, our wishes 
of a happy new year.

<F P=106> [New Year's address to the nation by President Hastings Kama </F>
Kamazu Banda on 31 December; place not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Bwanas and Donas [Gentlemen and Ladies], good 
evening. The year 1993 is coming to an end in a few hours. As 
we celebrate this occasion, it is important that we reflect on 
some of the achievements and setbacks which we had during the 
year that has just ended. To begin with, you will recall that 
towards the end of 1992 I called for a national referendum on 
the system of national politics in this country. The results of 
the referendum, which was held on June 14th this year, were in 
favor of the introduction of a multiparty system of government. 
I readily accepted these results and urged the government to 
take the necessary legislative measures to ensure that the 
people's choice was respected and granted. 
  Bwanas and Donas, I am most pleased and happy that 
thereafter, the government moved swiftly to enact the necessary 
legislation for the integration of political pluralism in this 
country. Section 12 of the constitution was amended within two 
weeks of the referendum in order to turn the country into a 
multiparty state. Parliament also passed an act to provide for 
the registration of political parties in the country. Following 
these legislative measures, the country now has seven registered 
political parties, including the ruling Malawi Congress Party, 
MCP. 
  You will recall that on 23rd June 1993 I declared a general 
amnesty for all Malawian exiles irrespective of the political 
offences they had committed during the period when the country 
was a one-party state. The general amnesty was granted in order 
to enable such Malawians to return and participate freely in the 
new political process after the referendum. Parliament enacted 
the relevant general amnesty bill within two weeks of the 
referendum. 
  Since that time, almost all political exiles have returned 
home as free citizens and similarly, there are no political 
prisoners being held in our prisons now. 
  Bwanas and Donas, you will also recall that I established 
the 
presidential committee on dialogue last year to discuss and 
consult with the public affairs committee on issues of national 
interest. It is pleasing to me to note that the two committees 
[are] facilitating dialogue on many important issues and have 
made much progress. They reached agreement on the management of 
the transition process to political pluralism in the country. 
In August 1993, these two committees, representing government 
and the opposition, agreed to establish the National 
Consultative Council [NCC] and the National Executive Committee 
[NEC] to oversee the transition process. The National 
Consultative Council has already agreed on and drawn up a 
timetable of events leading to the holding of multiparty general 
elections on 17 May 1994. 
  Bwanas and Donas, the intensity of and the progress from the 
dialogue that has taken place in the NCC concerning the 
transition process, has demonstrated the good faith that exists 
between the opposition political parties and the government in 
the work for the country's future. As a result of that 
dialogue, the government has adopted a number of legislative 
measures aimed at ensuring free and fair general elections in 
May 1994. I would therefore like to commend the NCC and the NEC 
for the successful management of the transition process. I urge 
them to continue to cooperate and negotiate in good faith to 
resolve the remaining issues they have to handle. They must 
approach all these problems with the highest sense of 
responsibility and maturity because the competition will get 
more intense as we approach the election day. 
  As part of the transition process, I have recently appointed 
members of the electoral committee on the recomendation of the 
NCC. I have noted with pleasure that the electoral commission 
has now started its work. 
  Bwanas and Donas, you must remember that the main aim of 
political parties during the campaign process is to win more 
voters for the elections. This is mostly done by presenting the 
contents of the respective party's manifesto to the electorate 
in order to enable the electorate to make informed choices. I 
wish to appeal to the leaders and political parties to discuss 
their political differences with tolerance and to maintain peace 
and calm, law and order and racial harmony in the country during 
and even after the transition period. In making this appeal, I 
am confident that the same political wisdom which has enabled us 
to avoid ethnic violence and tribal hostilities over the past 31 
years will guide our political conduct all the way, that is 
before, during and well after the general elections. It is the 
moral duty for all of us to do our best to spare this country 
the political strife and social chaos which result in tragic 
loss of human life and property. 
  The government has now disarmed the military wing of the 
young pioneers movement through the Malawi Army and police. At 
its next sitting, parliament will repeal the relevant section of 
the Malawi Pioneer Act. Once again, as I said on (?2d) 
December, I regret the unfortunate loss of innocent life and 
damage to property which occurred during the initial phase of 
the disarmament exercise. It is my sincere hope that the people 
of this country will not have to go through such social 
tragedies again in the future. In this regard, you will recall 
that I recently set up a fund to assist the army and civilian 
victims of disarmament exercise. I, therefore, appeal to all 
concerned Malawians to contribute generously in support of this 
fund. 
  I understand that there were few members of the Malawi Youth 
Pioneers [MYP] who fled from their homes [words indistinct] at 
the beginning of the disarmament procedures which [as heard] may 
still be in hiding. I have also received reports that some of 
them may have crossed the border into Mozambique. If this is so, 
it is most unfortunate, though understandable. These young men 
are frightened and they were running for their lives. I would 
like to appeal to any MYP members that may still be in hiding to 
return home and report to the police and army officers who will 
ensure their safety. 
  If any MYP members have indeed crossed into Mozambique while 
fleeing for safety, I have confidence that our friends, the 
Mozambican authorities, will understand this event in this 
spirit. It is my hope that they will gather them from wherever 
they are and return them to us formally. We are most anxious to 
have them return home safely as precedents already exist for 
such an exchange, because I do recall that during the days of 
the Mozambican conflict, Mozambican soldiers who fled into 
Malawi while running away from the hostilities in the Mozambican 
conflict were always handed back formally to the authorities in 
Mozambique. 
  (?Here) I am happy to tell you that a meeting of the joint 
defense and security commission for Malawi and Mozambique is to 
be convened. It will take place in Blantyre starting Wednesday 
next week [5 January]. I have confidence that the issues will 
be resolved amicably at that meeting. 
  Now, turning to the economy of the country, I was relieved 
to 
note that after experiencing a most severe drought in the 
history of the country in 1991 [words indistinct]. It is 
unfortunate that the prices of tobacco and other crops were not 
satisfactory. This was due to [words indistinct]. As for this 
year, I wish to thank those of you who have cleared your gardens 
in good time in readiness for the rains. I, however, understand 
that the rains have been sporadic in some parts of the country. 
Let us all pray for good rains again this season so that we can 
be self-sufficient in food and sustain our economy, which, as we 
all know, is based on agriculture. 
  Lastly, I would like to thank very sincerely all the donors 
who met in Paris for deciding to resume development aid to 
Malawi. To quote from their own press release: I quote, "the 
donors confirm resumption of economic and financial support to 
Malawi in recognition of the exceptional progress made in 
political transformation and of the economic policy measures and 
(?steps taken) in the ongoing economic adjustment process." 
Such credit or commendation from the donor community these days 
is very significant. No one should belittle such an achievement 
in this country because many communities elsewhere are being 
condemned for political and economic mismanagement. All 
Malawians should be proud of such recognition in world politics 
today. In addition, the international community has spoken of 
Malawi as a model for the management of the process of political 
transition. In Paris, they praised all Malawians for our 
efforts to carry out the transition process in a peaceful and 
orderly manner. 
  I, therefore, appeal again to all Malawians to continue to 
be 
worthy of that praise. I agree with the donors that the process 
of political reform in this country should remain on track. We 
must cooperate with each other for the good of our nation 
despite our political differences. We must avoid irrational or 
emotional behavior. We must remain responsible by discussing 
and sorting out our grievances for the good future of our 
country. We must not jeopardize the successful dialogue which 
we have established with our donors in Paris. 
  Bwanas and Donas of all races, I would like to thank you for 
all the messages of encouragement and goodwill which I received 
while I was ill in South Africa and since my return. Let us all 
enter the year 1994 with a firm commitment to maintain peace and 
[word indistinct] law and order. We must forgive one another 
for any wrongdoing. We must encourage the spirit of 
reconciliation and tolerance, and we must indeed contribute to a 
stable and better Malawi, irrespective of our political 
affiliation. 
  This is why I (?have decreed) that there should be a general 
amnesty to cover everyone, including political offenders and 
those who violated our security laws, both here at home and 
abroad. We must remember and understand that certain actions 
were taken to safeguard the security of the country. 
  Bwanas and Donas, I wish you all a very happy and prosperous 
new year. May the Almighty God bless you all. Good night.

  [Excerpts] The cabinet met on 30 December from 1100 to 1300 
under the chairmanship of the head of state, His Excellency 
Henri Konan Bedie, and examined several reports, one draft bill, 
and two draft decrees. 
  Regarding the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the cabinet 
was briefed on the final agreement on the Uruguay-Round of 
negotiations. Started in 1986, the eighth round of multilateral 
trade negotiations ended on 15 December 1993. [passage omitted] 
  The cabinet decided to set up within the framework of the 
public sector-private sector liaison group a commission to 
examine the repercussions of the General Agreement on Trade and 
Tariffs Agreement on the Ivorian economy and to propose ways and 
means of enabling our country to receive the maximum benefits 
from this agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, 
the cabinet heard a report on the negotiation of a new fishing 
agreement between Cote d'Ivoire and the European Economic Union. 
The previous agreement expires on 14 January. The cabinet 
authorized a delegation to be sent to Brussels to negotiate the 
terms of this new agreement. 
  Regarding the Ministry Delegate to the Prime Minister in 
Charge of Economy, Finance, and Planning, the minister briefed 
the cabinet by commenting on certain decisions made at the 
ministerial meeting of the West African Monetary Union [UMOA] 
held in Dakar on 20 December. 
  This organization reviewed the measure to suspend the buying 
of the Central Bank of West African States bank notes that are 
exported outside the territories of member countries of the 
franc zone. It confirmed and strengthened this measure which 
contributes to the adjustment efforts being made by the UMOA 
member countries. 
  As part of these measures, the banks are henceforth 
authorized to get a maximum commission of 2 percent on manual 
exchange operations of the CFA franc for the French franc 
carried out at their teller windows by customers going abroad. 
  Regarding the same ministry, the cabinet was briefed on the 
measures adopted to meet state commitments. These measures 
concern a large part of the population. Indeed, on the 
instruction of the president of the Republic and in spite of the 
economic and financial difficulties facing our country, the 
treasury on 29 December settled some of its outstanding 
financial commitments in order to somehow lessen the burdens of 
the people at the end of the year. 
  The monies paid out cover a large number of budget posts, 
namely salaries. They are salaries of the civil service and 
national public enterprises [EPN] for December 1993 and payment 
of arrears for the greater part of the [EPN]. At this level, 
the payments made amount to 18 billion CFA francs. 
  The scholarships of university students and students in 
institutions of higher learning: On this point, an amount of 
600 million CFA francs was paid to students in institutions of 
higher learning covering December and the arrears. As for 
scholarships of university students, 337 million CFA francs was 
disbursed as October payments while waiting for the decisions of 
the scholarship awards commission which is sitting on 
scholarship attributions for the 1993-94 academic year. 
  Pensions: Payments made were for December and the arrears. 
At this level, the sum of 1 billion CFA francs was disbursed. 
  State contractors: At this level, the sum of 600 million CFA 
francs was disbursed to pay small- and medium-scale enterprises. 
  The payments made also concern subsidies to state 
enterprises, the necessary expenses for the running of our 
consular and diplomatic chancelleries, some expenses to be 
incurred in restructuring the financial system, etc. 
  In all, the financial effort made by the government covered 
a 
global amount of 30 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Monrovia, 30 Dec (AFP) -- An official 
representative of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] 
-- the main armed Liberian faction --disclosed on 30 December 
that General William Gengsen, the faction's "deputy defense 
minister," was killed on 23 December as he attempted to end 
armed clashes among the faction's soldiers. 
  The source, however, did not give the reasons for the 
shooting or the number of soldiers who took part in it. The 
incident occurred in Ganta, 60 km east of Gbarnga, which in turn 
lies 160 km northeast of Monrovia -- the headquarters for NPFL 
leader Charles Taylor. 
  An informed source reported that the clashes were sparked by 
a group of men who were demanding "allowances" in anticipation 
of their future demobilization, as well as a "special bonus" for 
Christmas. The same source further disclosed that Mr. Taylor 
was planning on traveling to the scene but was dissuaded from 
doing so by his close advisers. 
  Disarmament and demobilization of all armed Liberian 
factions 
could begin in mid-January.

  [Text] Monrovia, Dec 31 (AFP) -- The rebel National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the country's main armed 
faction, said Friday [31 December] that [it] would only disarm 
its troops when transitional institutions were officially 
established. This position, announced by NPFL radio, is 
diametrically opposed to that of the Interim Government of 
National Unity (IGNU), which has said that such institutions can 
only become functional once disarmament begins. 
  According to the inter-factional peace accord signed by the 
IGNU, the NPFL and ULIMO (United Liberation Movement) on July 25 
in Cotonou, Benin, disarmament should be carried out 
simultaneously with the setting up of transitional institutions. 
  The NPFL also contested the presence in Liberia of the 
ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] peacekeeping force deployed by the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS), which -- assisted by the UN 
Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) -- is to supervise the 
disarmament process. 
  "Only the five-member State Council (the tripartite interim 
governing body) can provisionally authorize the deployment of 
foreign troops throughout the country," the NPFL said. 
  "For UNOMIL and ECOMOG to be deployed throughout the 
country, 
an agreement between the legitimate government of Liberia and 
the United Nations and another between the government and ECOWAS 
must be signed," it added. "Only the State Council has the 
authority to order the parties to remove checkpoints, gates, and 
the actual physical disarmament of all parties." 
  "Men, women, and ordinary citizens took up arms against the 
past government because it was not representative and did not 
address their concerns and grievances," said the NPFL, which was 
behind the rebellion that began on December 24, 1989, against 
the government of President Samuel Doe, who was assassinated in 
September 1990. 
  "Now that they have decided upon a legitimately accepted 
government in which they are represented, they are prepared to 
peacefully and voluntarily surrender their arms to that 
authority," it said. "Give them their government and they will 
give up their arms." 
  In the meantime, France on Friday condemned recent attacks 
against humanitarian organizations in northern Liberia, which 
forced them to withdraw from the area, calling on all factions 
to "show restraint." 
  Lucette Michauyx-Chevry, the French minister in charge of 
humanitarian aid and human rights, demanded "that confiscated 
materiel and equipment be returned to the organizations, that 
civilian populations be protected, and that the security of 
humanitarian organizations' personnel be guaranteed."

  [Text] The raid on a UNHCR camp at Vahun in Liberia on 
Christmas day by ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
in Liberia] forces loyal to Alhaji Koromah is being taken 
advantage of by Koromah's political opponents. Reports said 
ULIMO forces commandeered trucks at gun point, looted supplies, 
and stole medicines and vaccines. Alhaji Koromah said nothing 
like that happened, that the trucks had been taken into 
safekeeping, and that the whole thing had been stirred up by 
Medecins Sans Frontiere. Well Madison Wion of the rival ULIMO 
wing called us up and Robin White asked him what he had to say 
about the events at Vahun: 
  [Begin recording] [Wion] We strongly condemn the situation 
in 
Vahun and we want to dissociate ourselves from it; and these are 
the fears that we've been having, looking at Koromah hijacking 
leadership, and we have been saying that Koromah is not the 
leader. And so, the problem in Vahun, we are not surprised. We 
knew that the elements who are loyal to Koromah would have 
caused us this problem. 
  [White] Now Alhaji Koromah says that his men were not 
responsible for any serious trouble there. 
  [Wion] Robin, we will never believe Alhaji Koromah. 
  [White] But you don't have any power any more. 
  [Wion] In term of what sir? 
  [White] I mean Alhaji Koromah is the leader of ULIMO. 
  [Wion] Koromah is not the leader of ULIMO. We don't know 
what justification he has to back his claim. We need to say 
that because he had the support of the military. From our 
assessment we know that it is not all of the military give 
Koromah the support. He has his elements that he is using. 
  [White] Yes, but do you have any armed men any more? 
  [Wion] We have armed men both in Liberia and Sierra Leone. 
  [White] How many armed men do you have? 
  [Wion] We are talking about in term of more than 5,000 to 
6,000. We have almost everybody that is in Liberia. 
  [White] Except for those with Alhaji Koromah? 
  [Wion] Except for those elements that Alhaji Koromah brought 
in who are not... [pauses] who quarrel with ULIMO's disciplinary 
measures. 
  [White] Now, you know, what do you think should happen in 
Liberia now? 
  [Wion] In term of what sir? 
  [White] In terms of the future. 
  [Wion] What is needed to be done, looking at the trend of 
events, is that let there be a national conference, because you 
cannot give power to warring factions. Why not call in 
everybody to include the political parties, the religious 
leaders, the various interest groups, and you name it. Call 
them to the conference table; let everybody come out with a 
platform, how we all should get to the rightful solution of our 
country. 
  [White] Could I ask you what attitude the Sierra Leone 
Government takes toward you operating in Freetown? 
  [Wion] I mean, the same attitude. They know that we have 
been fighting to protect our position, to protect our people. 
We still have thousands of refugees all around the country, and 
we cannot sit here for Foday Sankoh or Alhaji, I mean.... 
[pauses] how do they call him? Charles Taylor people to come 
and consume our people unnecessarily. [sentence as heard] So, 
we have to also take that position all of the time. So, we are 
both here in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
  [White] Are your men fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean 
Army against Foday Sankoh rebels? 
  [Wion] The objective is not to fight against Foday Sankoh 
rebels, but what we are saying here is Foday Sankoh is not just 
Foday Sankoh. It is Charles Taylor that is causing the trouble. 
He is creating the whole problem. It is not merely Foday 
Sankoh and we will not allow Charles Taylor to come and cause 
damage to our people and even our host! 
  [White] So, can I take that you are fighting alongside the 
Sierra Leone Army against Foday Sankoh? 
  [Wion] That is not a question to ask. We will continue to 
fight for our own protection in the first place. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Nigerian security agents have 
seized about 50,000 copies of this week's edition of the TELL 
news magazine, the management of the magazine has announced. 
  Sunday's crackdown was the first move against the press 
since 
the military regime of General Sani Abacha came to power last 
November 17. 
  The editor-in-chief of the magazine, Nosa Igiebor, said in 
an 
official statement quoted by the press Monday that the magazine 
has as its cover headline "The Return of Tyranny: Abacha Bares 
His Fangs". The article concerned examines 10 decrees made 
public two weeks ago, most of which terminated jurisdiction by 
the courts in matters pertaining to the new military 
administration. 
  Several prominent Nigerians and human rights organisations 
have criticised the laws, which Justice Minister Olu Onagoruwa 
said would be amended, as they were printed before his 
appointment. 
  Igiebor's company lost thousands of naira (thousands of 
dollars) last year under the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida 
following the seizure, at various times, of about 300,000 copies 
of the magazine which the authorities considered critical. 
  Babangida last year annulled the outcome of a long-awaited 
presidential poll in June, failed to hand over power to elected 
civilians as he had pledged after 10 years of military rule, and 
installed an unelected transitional civilian premier in August. 
The military replaced that government almost three months later. 
  TELL's editors, staff, distributors and vendors were 
constantly detained, arrested, harrassed and beaten for the most 
part of last year, Igiebor said.

  [Text] The Nigeria Labor Congress, NLC, has called on 
workers to participate fully and be prepared to make necessary 
sacrifices this year to save the country's democratic aspiration 
and socioeconomic well-being. In his new year message, the NLC 
president, Mr. Pascal Bafyau, said that 1994 holds another 
promise for the working class and labor unions in the nation's 
drive to democracy and struggle for economic survival. He said 
despite the experiences of last year, the working class and 
Nigerians in general should show a renewed sense of optimism, 
commitment, and confidence in the ability of the nation to 
transform its [words indistinct] in the future. Mr. Bafyau said 
that the government had taken the initiative to ensure that 
workers were in the mainstream of national output. He also 
enjoined the business community, especially transporters, 
landlords, traders, and petty businessmen to be humane in fixing 
(?tags) and prices for their goods and services to make life 
more bearable for the public.

  [Text] Yesterday evening, in his traditional New Year 
message, head of state Abdou Diouf announced backup measures to 
cushion the effects of the emergency plan on the purchasing 
power of workers after elaborating on the problems which led to 
the adoption of this plan. 
  [Begin recording] We (?believe) that whatever our 
difficulties, in order to build our economy on a sound and 
flexible base, it is better to make proposals that will finally 
put Senegalese far ahead of other African countries. History 
will not forgive us if we sacrifice the dignity of the oncoming 
generations to preserve our own interests and make ourselves 
fragile. That is why I have decided to maintain the plan as it 
was passed. I have approved, in conformity with the 
constitution, measures aimed at creating, with reasonable 
sacrifices and for a limited period, the conditions for a sound 
and sustained economic growth -- the basis for the development 
of our country -- instead of hazardous and very expensive 
solutions. 
  Thus, I want to remain truthful to the mandate that you have 
entrusted to me which gives me the right to somehow anticipate 
the traps that are on the road lined with land mines which leads 
to development. Of ocourse, I remain open to dialogue with only 
one objective: finding the best solutions for our people. 
  Thus, the government has just ended consultations with 
Senegalese businessmen on the problems facing them before and 
after the adoption of the emergency plan. The discussions took 
place in a serene atmosphere and fruitful decisions were made. 
That augurs well for the series of meetings on the economic 
situation. I have asked the prime minister to set up before the 
end of January 1994 a committee that will be responsible for 
preparing the meetings. 
  In the same vein, to cushion the bad effects of the plan on 
the purchasing power of workers, I have approved the reduction 
of the prices of certain basic commodities. The prime minister 
will give you a list of the commodities and the rate of 
reductions. 
  Finally, I confirm that, as promised, the measures adopted 
in 
the emergency plan will be implemented with openness after the 
adoption of the documents. To this effect, the monitoring 
committee will be set up and benefit from my total support to 
fully accomplish its mission. [end recording] 
  In conformity with the head of state's decision to adopt 
backup measures for the emergency plan to help consumers, the 
prices of the following commodities and services will be reduced 
as of 3 January 1994: rent -- at the SICA [expansion unknown] 
rents lower than 25,000 francs will be reduced by 15 percent. 
Rents between 25,000 francs and 100,000 francs will be reduced 
by 7 percent. Rents higher than 100,000 francs will be reduced 
by 5 percent. All low- and medium-priced houses [FL-HLM] will 
be reduced 6 percent. 
  Cement: One metric tonne of cement will be reduced 6 
percent. 
Electricity: 5 percent reduction on the price of one kilowatt of 
low voltage. Telephone: connection fee is reduced by 10 
percent, reconnection fee by 50 percent, and maintenance fee by 
10 percent. 
  Soap: 8.5 percent reduction on the price of a cake or a bar 
of soap weighing 200 grams has been reduced from 75 francs to 68 
francs, a soap of 500 grams from 160 francs to 146 francs, and 
the one weighing 750 grams from 230.5 francs to 228 francs. 
Instant coffee: there is a reduction of 100 francs on the price 
of the family size tin. 
  The maximum time for the liquidation of debts incurred from 
the purchase of state-built houses has been extended from 40 to 
48 months. 
  In his New Year message to the nation, the president of the 
Republic also reaffirmed the policies of regional development 
and the struggle to create job opportunities: 
  [Begin recording] I am persuaded that the continued 
development of our democracy and the accomplishment of the 
mission that you have entrusted me depend on bold efforts of 
decentralization. It is with full determination that this 
project is becoming a (?reality). We are working towards 
incorporating into the objective of regional integration our 
pan-African ambitions which constitute an everyday ideal for our 
youths [words indistinct]. It is the question of regional 
integration and development that will enable the realization of 
big joint projects in which the necessary aspect of 
supranationality will remain in harmony with the identity of 
each and everyone. 
  Regarding the struggle for employment, I have a strong 
conviction that creating 20,000 jobs every year during this 
five-year period is a Senegalese challenge [word indistinct] 
because we are going to take up together the challenge of 
training and imagination. 
  Restoring lasting peace in Casamance is also the concern of 
the president of the Republic. We must search for a permanent 
solution to restore lasting peace following France's testimony. 
[Words indistinct]. I warmly thank all those who enabled us to 
pass through this difficult stage. It is a challenge to be 
taken up and I firmly promise not to leave any stone unturned to 
[words indistinct]. That is the decisive turning point that 
will enable the return of peace in the Casamance Region in the 
interest of these brave people [words indistinct]. [end 
recording]

  [Text] France has threatened to withdraw its electoral 
assistance to Togo if conditions are not met for the holding of 
a fair legislative election on 23 January and 6 February. This 
was stated by Richard Duque, spokesman of the French Foreign 
Affairs Ministry. In a statement published yesterday, Richard 
Duque pointed out that right now, material conditions for a fair 
and democratic election have not been met, adding that the 
review of voters register and the distribution of the voting 
cards have encountered a preoccupying delay. 
  He added that France has decided, in conformity with the 11 
July Ouagadougou Accords, to send security and military 
observers to Togo in the coming days to join the Burkinabe 
military observers. French experts who are assisting in the 
electoral preparations have already started their work together 
with experts from other countries. However, Richard Duque said, 
France has stated that it will have to withdraw all of its 
observer team staff and its electoral assistance if conditions 
for a fair, democratic, and multiparty election are not met when 
the electoral campaign opens.

  [Text] Lome, Dec 31 (AFP) -- Togolese opposition parties 
contesting the forthcoming general elections said Thursday it 
would be "technically impossible" to hold the elections on 
January 23 and February 6 as scheduled. 
  The two main moderate opposition movements: The Action 
Committee for Renewal (CAR) of Yao Agboyibo and the Togolese 
Union for Democracy (UTD) of Edem Kodjo and five smaller parties 
spelled out their complaints in a joint statement given to AFP. 
  The seven parties said the government had set the opening of 
the election campaign for January 7 inspite of the fact that 
"the updating of electoral rolls is not yet complete" and 
"distribution of voter cards is nowhere near starting". 
  The opposition parties said they would "not bow to 
unilateral 
decisions taken with no consensus" and added that the elections 
had to be "free, open, fair and acceptable for everybody". 
  More than 300 candidates representing 15 parties have 
registered in the race for the 81 seats in the national assembly. 
  Two other opposition parties: The Union for Democracy and 
Solidarity (UDS) of Antoine Folly and the Democrats' Party for 
Unity (PDU) of Lucien Sanvi de Tove, have already said they will 
boycott the poll. 
  The opposition in exile led by Gilchrist Olympio has also 
urged a boycott. 
  The entire opposition abstained in the August presidential 
poll won by President Gnassingbe Eyadema with 96 percent of the 
vote.

  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- Four people were killed and 
seven wounded when at least five men burst into the crowded 
Heidelberg Pub and Restaurant Tavern in Station Road, 
Observatory, and sprayed patrons with R4 or R5 automatic rifle 
fire. Before opening fire a grenade was lobbed into the tavern 
which did not detonate. 
  The attack which happened at 11:50 PM followed a similar 
pattern to that in Kenilworth, Cape Town, earlier this year when 
gunmen lobbed a grenade and opened fire on worshipers in the St 
James Church. Eleven people died in that attack. 
  Three people in the tavern among the about 60 patrons were 
killed in the attack while the owner of nearby Machados 
restaurant, Jose Cerqueira, was also killed by the attackers 
when he tried to return fire. 
  The area was immediately cordoned off by police and 
roadblocks set up as far as George and Port Elizabeth, police 
radio control said. Police had also deployed 43 additional 
vehicles in the townships to try and locate the getaway vehicle, 
a blue Opel Rekord believed to have been stolen in Khayelitsha 
at 11PM. Police helicopters were also being deployed. 
  The grenade was later on Friday morning detonated by police 
in the tavern resulting in windows being blown out. 
  The scene at 4:30AM resembled a shambles. Benches and tables 
were piled outside in station road. 
  The media were not allowed inside the tavern as police were 
still busy with investigations, but from the entrance it looked 
like the tavern had been hit by a bomb. 
  A coffee shop, "Down at Marlenes" opposite the tavern had 
one 
of its windows shattered by bullets. The owner of the Benson 
Bistro close to the Heidelberg Tavern, Anita Haupt, said she was 
just closing her premises when the attack occurred. "I thought 
it was a car backfiring," Ms Haupt said. She said the owners of 
the restaurants in the area were getting together to organise 
stricter security. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV news later 
reported the registration number of the getaway car as being XA- 
20252.

  [Text] Abidjan, Jan 1 (AFP) -- Ivory Coast President Henri 
Konan Bedie, in his first speech Friday [31 December] since 
succeeding the late Felix Houphouet-Boigny, denounced the 
neo-colonialism gripping the West African nation's economy. 
  "It is not right that our industry should find itself back 
in 
the doldrums, that a large part of our wholesale and retail 
industry has fallen into the hands of foreigners and that our 
farm exports are still subject to a trading system that bears an 
irritating resemblance to the aberrations of the colonial era," 
he said in a year end address to the nation. 
  Konan Bedie, who succeeded to the presidency after 
Houphouet-Boigny's death on December 7, said the country needed 
quick solutions that could put the country back on the rails. 
  He added that the country was on the road to recovery when 
it 
came to balancing the budget and trade deficit.

  [Excerpts] Today a demonstration was held by the Front for 
Democracy in Burundi [FRODEBU] Party and parties allied to that 
of the president, namely the People's Party, Burundi People's 
Rally, and Liberal Party. For two full hours they marched 
through the streets of Bujumbura. 
  The demonstrators had only one goal on their banners and in 
their slogans: Support the arrival of the Mission for 
Protection and Restoration of trust in Burundi -- Miprobu, in 
short. Christopher Nkurunziza followed the march. [passage 
omitted] 
  All along the streets of the city center the placards and 
slogans were more than clear. For the demonstrators, Miprobu is 
a shield of democracy and no durable peace can come to Burundi 
without the coming of this international force. According to 
the demonstrators, the 180 soldiers of the Miprobu are 
insufficient and the government should request that the number 
of Miprobu troops be multiplied by 10. 
  The militants of the ruling party and its allies marched for 
more than 15 km in light rain before reaching the Football 
Federation Club stadium in front of the Source of the Nile 
Hotel. [passage omitted] 
  In the speech he delivered on the occasion, Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, speaker of the National Assembly and interim 
chairman of the FRODEBU party, noted the power of last 1 June 
emanates from the people's will. The latter is sovereign. 
Thus, according to him, it was legitimate that the ruling 
party, the president of the Republic, the National Assembly and 
the government control all the organs of the country. The 
speaker of the Burundi National Assembly said that when the 
government calls on Africans to provide the security of the 
government, no contrary decision can be taken. The Army will 
have to cooperate with the Miprobu which, according to Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya, is not coming to plunge the country back into 
chaos.

  [Text] In Cameroon, civil servants are continuing their 
strike despite the appeal to resume work made by President Paul 
Biya in his new year's message. Magistrates and medical doctors 
who had so far stayed away from the industrial action this 
morning joined the striking workers. Louis Salef, general 
secretary of the Confederation of Cameroon Workers Union, 
explains the strike to Jean Mater Ndi: 
  [Begin recording] [Salef] The strike order issued by the 
magistrates and medical doctors has been observed massively 
throughout the country. There were also diversionary tactics by 
the government. According to the head of state's message, it 
was suggested that career problems affecting doctors and 
magistrates would be revised, but this was only to amuse them. 
It was said that their salaries would be revised and increased 
by 50 percent from the reductions announced. All these are 
diversionary tactics. Today all these comrades, even from the 
private sector, felt the need to join us to efficiently carry 
out the struggle. 
  [Ndi] What did you notice when you went around? 
  [Salef] We noted that the Yaounde magistrates had gathered 
in a courtroom but were not working, which means that they were 
observing their strike order. At the Yaounde central hospital, 
for example, the strike order is being observed on a massive 
scale. However, we deplore that some strategies have been put 
in place to play down the strike and to intimidate the workers 
who would like to join their striking counterparts. [end

  [Text] We have just said goodbye to 1993 and welcomed 1994. 
As is the tradition, the new year is a time when resolutions 
are made and relatives and friends extend their best wishes to 
one another. President Pascal Lissouba, who is no exception to 
the rule, addressed the nation on the evening of 31 December. 
In his message, the head of state outlined measures that would 
bring about peace, which our country badly needs for its 
development. Here is what President Pascal Lissouba said: 
  [Begin Lissouba recording] The first challenge is to ensure 
a 
spiritual and moral awakening through systematic education of 
our people, especially our children. The second challenge is to 
rebuild the country and to rebuild towns that were destroyed or 
ruined by blind and savage violence. The third challenge is to 
make people understand, support, and consolidate the process 
toward peace and reconciliation among communities which have 
been torn apart. It is only when we are ready to accept and 
assume the contents of these challenges that a new political 
initiative will be proposed to our people in consultation with 
the leading political groups so that social peace will be truly 
consolidated. 
  The tragic events which occurred in the country are 
sufficient proof that the Congolese political class has not yet 
understood the first thing about democratic values, which still 
remains [words indistinct]. If it took Europe 100 years to 
achieve that, Africa should achieve these democratic values 
within just a few years. [end recording] 
  President Lissouba also had a message for the youth, 
especially the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral 
Development [MCDDI] and the Pan-African Union for Social 
Democracy [UPADS] activists. He called on them to demonstrate 
the fact that they are the reflection of Congo and its future. 
  [Begin Lissouba recording] I turn to our political party 
activists, and more especially to you, youth of MCDDI and UPADS. 
You are all children of Congo, and I owe it to you all, in my 
triple capacity as a father, a man of science, and a statesman, 
the heavy responsibility to see to your welfare, your education, 
and your training. It is necessary that your parents -- and it 
should also be the same for your various parties -- make this a 
duty, a privilege, and even an essential priority. Indeed, 
Congo as a whole is suffering. It is suffering from the image 
you are creating for it; it is worried about your future. I 
therefore call on you, through your political leaders, to pay 
heed to (?what we propose), to cease-fire, show discipline, and 
to put an end to provocation, which leads to rebellion and acts 
as an excuse for various reprisals. It is a necessary condition 
that will enable your political leaders to present their 
political problems and peacefully find the most favorable 
solutions for the youth of this country. 
  I also call on the national mediators, the political 
parties, 
and the general staff of the Congolese Armed Forces, the joint 
staff of the security forces to agree on the conditions, the 
modalities, and programs for training, organizing, educating, 
and assessing all our unemployed youth who interrupted their 
studies or were illegally recruited as private militiamen. It 
is only under these conditions that the people who have been 
traumatized by so much atrocity can be reassured. This must 
necessarily be accompanied by the streamlining of the Armed 
Forces, and the restoration of confidence and discipline within 
the Army. There should also be more solidarity between the 
Congolese Armed Forces, the gendarmerie, and public security 
agencies. The reorganization of the Armed Forces [words 
indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Congo's state-owned 
hydrocarbons company on Monday [3 January] imposed fuel 
rationing in the capital Brazzaville in the wake of violent 
political unrest sparked by elections. Hydro-Congo announced, 
according to state radio, that petrol and diesel fuel supplies 
must be limited to 30 litres (eight U.S. gallons) per vehicle 
per day, while selling in jerrycans is totally forbidden. 
  The latter measure aims to counter the flourishing black 
market of recent weeks, which has seen a litre of fuel selling 
for 1,000 CFA francs (3.4 dollars) instead of the official 600 
CFA francs (two dollars). 
  Political trouble has led to the closure of the rail link 
from the capital to the west African nation's oil city, 
Pointe-Noire, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) to the east, which 
has a refinery. 
  Bacongo, an opposition stronghold in the capital, was calm 
Monday, following clashes on Friday between armed supporters of 
the government and the opposition which left four people dead, 
according to witnesses. Relative calm was reported from other 
parts of the capital, but sporadic shooting was heard overnight 
in the Talangai district in the north of the city. 
  Several women's associations called Monday for an end to the 
violence, which has left at least 93 people dead since early 
December, according to a tally compiled from hospital reports.

  [Excerpts] The special representative of the UN secretary 
general, Mr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh, is at a loss to explain 
the last minute obstacles to the setting up of transitional 
institutions, because UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR] 
did everything possible for the easy progress of the process. 
For him, the commitments made by Rwandan officials have not 
been respected. Here is his declaration: 
  [Begin Booh-Booh recording] This meeting gives us an 
opportunity to make clarifications on the mandate and the 
responsibilities of UNAMIR in the context of the difficulties 
faced by Rwandan political officials in the setting up of 
transitional institutions as stipulated in the Arusha peace 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  The setting up of the transitional institutions had been 
planned for 37 days after the signing of the Arusha agreement. 
No one can say that time was short nor that, unfortunately, 
transitional institutions have been established. One can only 
note that commitments made by Rwandan officials to the 
international community have not been respected. Once again, I 
say that UNAMIR did everything which had to be done. We held 
many meetings with the country's main political leaders. The 
delay in the setting up of the transitional institutions cannot 
be understood nor is it acceptable. The credibility of Rwandan 
officials in the eyes of the Rwandan people and the 
international community is now in question. How can one explain 
the reasons for the last minute obstacles when everything seemed 
ready on 29 December? 
  How can one convince the United Nations, especially the 
Security Council, of the seriousness of the solemn commitments 
made by Rwandan officials? How can one explain to the Rwandan 
people about the delay which constitutes a grave threat to the 
future of the country? How can one explain to the international 
financial institutions and donor countries the absence of a 
responsible government in Rwanda that will work with them for 
the recovery of the country's economy? Finally, how can one 
explain to the thousands of Rwandans, who are impatient to 
return without fear to their homes, the meaning of the squabbles 
of some political leaders? 
  UNAMIR remains, more than ever, ready to carry out its 
mandate. It is up to the signatories of the Arusha agreement of 
4 August 1993, in conformity with Article 5, to meet 
expeditiously and do everything possible to implement one of the 
most important tenets of the agreement, that is the setting up 
of the transitional institutions. Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] Who is the successor of Melchior Ndadaye, the 
Burundian president who was assassinated last October? The 
Front for Democracy in Burundi [FRODEBU] party organized a 
meeting of its high-ranking officials in Bujumbura yesterday in 
order to identify the candidate for the post of future head of 
state. The name of the person to replace President Ndadaye will 
be made known tomorrow. But already a name is circulating in 
the Burundian capital. Celcius Nsengiyunva reports. 
  [Nsengiyunva] Only two hours were needed for the FRODEBU 
high-ranking officials to agree on the name of the person to be 
put forward for the post of president of the Republic, but the 
name of the person to replace the assassinated Melchior Ndadaye 
had already been [words indistinct] of the FRODEBU party and the 
current session was just a formality. Although the president of 
FRODEBU, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, did not reveal the name 
to the press, the name of his party's candidate -- the name on 
all lips in Bujumbura -- is that of the current minister of 
agriculture and livestock, Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira. The 
president of FRODEBU, in fact, minutes later [word indistinct] 
militants, said it by declaring "we chose for you a man that you 
know well, who is very close to farmers". 
  In fact the choice of Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira is certainly 
the 
result of the political bargaining which has been going on for 
some days with the opposition and the civil service. From the 
moment that the majority of people accept that the future 
president must come from the party which won the elections of 
last June, there is a need for a candidate who reassures both 
the Hutu and Tutsi communities. By remaining very discreet all 
through the current crisis, Mr. Ntaryamira has been able to win 
the trust of everybody.

<F P=106> [Article by RDG: "Zaire Fears Week of New Disturbances"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- The first week of 1994 in Zaire could 
well bring new unrest and looting. Zairian intellectuals in 
Brussels believe that President Mobutu is achieving exactly what 
he set out to achieve. His country is in a complete economic 
and social mess, and the hope of democratic reform is further 
off than ever. 
  The "New Zaire" (NZ) which was introduced on 21 October 1993 
by the pro-Mobutu government of Faustin Birundwa is visibly 
collapsing. The original exchange rate of three NZ for one 
dollar had climbed to 37 NZ to the dollar by last weekend. On 
the black market in Kinshasa, people were paying as much as 110 
NZ last Friday. In addition, the introduction of the NZ has met 
with political opposition. This is strongest in East Kasai -- 
where prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi comes from -- and in the 
Kivu province. On 29 November clashes with the military in 
Kananga left at least seven dead. 
  As a deterrent, President Mobutu had already dispatched his 
DSP [Special Presidential Division] to the Mbuji-Mayi diamond 
center. But the dealers are still refusing to accept the NZ. 
Any firm action by the DSP seems out of the question for the 
moment as the population is apparently well armed. Today, 
however, the presidential guard will enforce a total curfew and 
carry out large- scale house searches. 
  In Bukavu the border with Rwanda has been closed for several 
days now. The shortages of goods had prompted many people to 
seek out supplies across the border. The Zairian government 
will not tolerate this and the military are firing mercilessly 
at anyone who infringes the ban. 
  In the New Year, the thoughts of many Zairians are returning 
to the notorious 4 January 1959. In the then Leopoldstad, the 
troops of General Janssens put down the sudden call for 
"Dipenda" with brutal violence. The result was a couple of 
hundred dead and at least as many wounded. But in just one day 
independence was within reach. 
  Thirty-five years later the Zairians are once again calling 
for dignity and freedom. The failure of monetary reform and of 
two months of political negotiations have robbed them of their 
last grain of hope for improvement in a situation which becomes 
increasingly hopeless by the day. No end is yet in sight to the 
oppression and the exploitation.

  [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] in the Cape has demanded 
that APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army] be declared a 
banned organization with immediate effect. The party says in a 
statement that APLA and Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; 
ANC military wing] members who seek asylum in Transkei after 
committing acts of terror should be arrested by the South 
African Police. The party denounced negotiations between the 
government and the ANC [African National Congress] and PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] and called for action against the two 
organizations. 
  In a separate statement the CP appealed to whites to stop 
using trains as, according to it, the security situation on the 
railways has deteriorated to such an extent that whites are no 
longer safe while using the service. The CP's chief spokesman 
on transport, Mr. Joseph Chiole, said that whites who were 
compelled to use rail transport should arm themselves and not 
travel alone.

  [Text] A self-proclaimed APLA [Azanian People's Liberation 
Army] commander says an elite unit of the PAC's [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] military wing carried out the Heidelberg Tavern 
attack. This claim has been made in a telephone call to THE 
CITIZEN newspaper. John Matham has the details: 
  THE CITIZEN reports that a man calling himself Karl Zimbiri 
phoned the paper and identified himself using a pre-arranged 
code word established several months ago. Zimbiri reportedly 
said that an elite unit called the People's Concern had carried 
out both the Heidelberg attack and the St James Church massacre 
in July. Zimbiri says the unit is still in the country ready to 
strike again. He says it is propaganda to suggest that the unit 
has fled to Transkei. Zimbiri says the People's Concern is a 
special unit formed 10 months ago as a sub-structure of APLA. 
He says the unit consists of APLA's best people who have been 
trained in countries around the world. The PAC does not want to 
comment on the alleged existence of a special unit. The Law and 
Order Ministry has not been available for comment.

<F P=106> [Statement by the African National Congress issued in </F>
Marshalltown on 3 January] 
  [Text] The ANC is appalled at the apparent refusal of the 
government to deploy security forces in northern Natal. This 
follows a request to the government from the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] to deploy security forces in four areas of 
northern Natal to defend lives and property against the 
deteriorating security situation in the area. 
  In his response, Law and Order spokesperson Craig Kotze is 
quoted on as stating that the TEC has no powers to order the 
government to deploy security forces in Natal and that such 
deployment would amount to an invasion. 
  Kotze's reaction is based on narrow petty political 
interests 
that seek to curry favours with the National Party political 
allies. Coming in the wake of today's media reports that over 38 
people were killed in Natal in violence related incidents over 
the New Year weekend, his statement is both insensitive to the 
plight of victims of violence and arrogant to the extreme. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] is shocked that despite 
police reports that the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] had launched 
a campaign to drive ANC members from some areas and more 
violence was likely in the run-up to elections. It will be 
unfortunate if the perception is to deepen that the government 
has allowed the violence in Natal to escalate because it views 
black lives as cheap. 
  As far as the ANC is concerned, all self governing 
territories are bound by the provisions of the TEC act. In this 
context we expect these provisions to apply to all 
self-governing territories without fear or favour. 
  The primary duty of maintaining law and order in all areas 
of 
the country, including self-governing territories lies primarily 
with the South African security forces. 
  In terms of the Self-governing Territories Constitution Act 
21 of 1971 the homeland governments have no right to interfere 
with the "powers, entry into and presence of the South African 
security forces in the maintenance of public peace and order and 
the preservation of internal security in and the safety of the 
area concerned and the Republic". 
  The act further places the onus for the maintenance of 
order, 
peace and internal security in such areas (self-governing 
territories) on the South African Police (SAP). Clearly the 
government has a moral and legal obligation arising from the 
self-governing territories act to bring peace and stability to 
Natal. 
  It is ironic that the government which over the past years 
found it possible to detain, maim, and murder anti-apartheid 
activists residing in such areas should today find it 
politically inexpedient to bring about peace and stability in 
the same areas. We ask: What interests does the National Party 
government have in the escalation of violence particularly in 
the run-up to elections in Natal? 
  The ANC and the public will hold the South African 
Government 
accountable for the escalation of violence as a result of the 
IFP plans to drive out members of the ANC from certain areas of 
Natal.

  [Excerpt] Nineteen-ninety-four has had a violent start in 
Natal and on the East Rand, where at least 80 people have been 
murdered in crime related or politically motivated violence 
since Friday. More than 60 of the deaths occurred in Natal and 
KwaZulu. Many of the killings took place in the Natal Midlands 
where 10 people died in separate attacks near Ladysmith, six in 
Greytown, three in Mooi River, and one in Estcourt. On the 
violence-torn East Rand, at least 17 bodies were found in 
Katlehong, Thokoza, and Vosloorus over the weekend and this 
morning. In the latest incidence a man was shot dead in 
Vosloorus this morning. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says the 
national peace keeping force must be deployed before the April 
election. Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military 
wing; MK] Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda says March must be the 
target date for the establishment of a multiparty force. John 
Matham has the details: 
  The establishment of a national peace keeping force will be 
discussed at the first meeting of the Law and Order Sub-Council 
of the Transitional Executive Council. There is some skepticism 
that the force could be set up and properly trained prior to 
April. A government source has told the BUSINESS DAY newspaper 
that the idea of creating a force is, in his words, dead in the 
water for political and logistical reasons. The government is 
concerned about the wisdom of deploying a poorly trained force 
in tense areas. But Nyanda insists that the force will replace 
the SAP [South African Police], especially the Internal 
Stability Unit, in dealing with political violence. Nyanda says 
the force will consist of about 10,000 men who will be selected 
from recruits who gather at assembly points.

<F P=106> [Report by Norman West] </F>
  [Text] Labour Party [LP] leader the Rev. Allan Hendrickse 
has complained to the ANC [African National Congress] leadership 
that he has been "villified" and "kept in the dark" about 
nominations and that there is a general "hostility" towards his 
party from certain ANC elements. In a letter to the ANC 
leadership on December 21, he appealed for a "bilateral" on 
January 12 to iron out differences. The letter, addressed to the 
"Chairman of the ANC list committee" with copies to ANC leader 
Mr. Nelson Mandela and ANC secretary-general Mr. Cyril 
Ramaphosa, is the first official acknowledgement by Mr. 
Hendrickse that he felt he and his party were "unwelcome" in ANC 
ranks. This is despite the fact that Mr. Mandela included him 
in his entourage to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize jointly 
with State President F.W. De Klerk on December 10. 
  There is great division within the ANC on whether the LP, 
the 
main coloured party to make possible the Tricameral Parliament 
-- which in turn drew fierce opposition from the Anti-Tricameral 
Parliament Movement, the United Democratic Front -- should now 
be taken on board the ANC election ticket. Whereas Mr. Mandela 
likes the idea of having Mr. Hendrickse as a "magnet" to attract 
coloured voters, elements within the ANC in the western Cape -- 
including western Cape chairman Dr. Allan Boesak -- are against 
it, despite the fact the LP is a partner in the Patriotic Front 
which acted as a united group during the Kempton Park 
negotiations. 
  Because of the bad blood between the LP and ANC rank and 
file 
members, it came as no surprise to observers when Mr. Ramaphosa, 
punted by the LP as the keynote speaker at its 28th annual 
congress in Cape Town this week, never turned up. Nor was there 
a single observer from the western Cape region of the ANC. The 
ANC "snub" occurred despite Mr. Hendrickse devoting his entire 
opening speech on Tuesday to urging coloured people to vote for 
the ANC on April 27. The antagonism between the LP and the ANC 
is clearly acknowledged by Mr. Hendrickse in his letter to the 
leadership -- of which the SUNDAY TIMES has a copy -- which 
reads: "The LP of SA [South Africa] was kept in the dark about 
details of the intended nomination procedure until it was too 
late to prepare for regional nomination conferences. LP members 
from different parts of the country eked out varying degrees of 
information and each followed his own procedure. The head 
committee of the LP of SA had no control over the nomination of 
persons from its ranks. The LP was granted such minuscule 
representation at the regional conferences and ... the hostility 
towards LP members is still too great for Labour to stand a fair 
chance. In the western Cape (ANC) conference, voting was 
preceded by meetings where questions and statements from the 
floor were provided for. This allowed people to vent their 
spleen. The Labour Party was villified and condemned as 
opportunists ..."

to me that they want to seek anything that can be used 
negatively against the kwaZulu government in particular. [end

<F P=106> [Report by De Wet Potgieter] </F>
  [Text] Zulu warriors have for some time already been 
undergoing military training on a large scale by right-wing 
instructors at secret training camps in the mountains of 
northern Natal and eastern Free State. The training in 
guerrilla warfare is in preparation for what right wingers 
describe as "the bloody war" expected between the African 
National Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in 
the run-up to the 27 April general election. 
  The secret training is the first official confirmation of 
the 
close military cooperation which exists between far-right 
paramilitary organizations and the Zulus. These close ties are 
not limited to the nonaggression pact recently signed between 
the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and East Rand Zulus by 
Mr. Eugene Terreblanche and Mr. Mwesi Twala in Vereeniging. 
<H5>  Military Intervention </H5>
  It appears that far-right underground organizations want to 
intervene militarily should the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] order the defense force to invade kwaZulu. It also appears 
that the far right will become involved in the bloody war 
between the ANC on the battlefields of Natal. This secret 
training is not part of the kwaZulu government's official 
training program for its so-called Community Protection Units 
[preceding three words in English], which is being handled by 
the kwaZulu Police. 
  RAPPORT has established that the far right has a fairly 
effective intelligence network in place in northern Natal which 
works closely with the Zulus. Mr. Zanzi Sibanda, regional IFP 
organizer in northern Natal, confirmed to RAPPORT this week that 
"widespread training" of Zulus is taking place in the area. 
<H5>  Massacred </H5>
  He claimed that his people are being massacred on a large 
scale by ANC supporters, and their houses burned down. He 
showed RAPPORT an ANC pamphlet which was distributed about a 
week ago by the Madadeni branch in Newcastle, in which a call is 
made for the ANC's "enemy" to be wiped out and their homes 
burned down. "Kill the enemy or we perish," the pamphlet says. 
  Mr. Sibanda spoke to RAPPORT in the presence of the "Chief 
of 
Staff" of the Orde Boerevolk [Order of the Boer Nation], Mr. 
Leonard Veenendal, and referred to Mr. Veenendal as not merely 
an ally but "a good friend and brother." Mr. Sibanda said he is 
very worried about white MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing] commanders who are brought in from 
the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region to 
establish ANC "self-defense units" in northern Natal. He named 
two houses in the Dannhauser District where the ANC is storing 
weapons, and which are regularly visited by ANC Natal Chairman 
Mr. Harry Gwala. 
War [subhead] 
  "The ANC is preparing for full-scale war in Natal and the 
East Rand, in order to gain full control of these regions before 
the election," said Mr. Sibanda. "That is why I welcome help 
with the training of my people so that they can survive the 
struggle." 
  He expressed his concern over the possibility that the TEC 
will persuade the government to send defense force units to 
"take over" kwaZulu, or that an ANC government would do the same 
as President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who sent the Fifth 
Brigade into Matabeleland to suppress the supporters of Mr. 
Joshua Nkomo. 
  Mr. Veenendal told RAPPORT that the Zulus and the Boers have 
a common enemy, and that he had seen MK soldiers cold-bloodedly 
murdering innocent women and children in Natal and burning down 
their homes.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Defections Healthy in New Political Era -- The defection to 
the National Party, NP, of three African National Congress, ANC, 
military wing members -- "described as 'commanders' in some 
reports but whose status is downplayed by Umkhonto [Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing -- MK) Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda 
-- is neither surprising nor unwelcome," declares a page 8 
editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 January. The 
"enfranchisement of millions of black voters and the imminent 
birth of a new political era has introduced a fluidity into 
South African politics." THE STAR finds this "reshuffling" 
healthy since it "breaks up the old racial ties and introduces 
new loyalties based on shared philosophies and interests. MK, 
the welfare of whose members has been neglected by the ANC, is 
no more immune to these shifts than the NP, the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] or the DP [Democratic Party]." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Criticism of Police Formalities on Killers Hiding in 
Transkei 
-- "Transkei military leader Bantu Holomisa has made the correct 
response to suggestions that terrorist suspects are sheltering 
in his territory," begins a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 January. Holomisa has told police 
he will cooperate if they want to extradite anyone. All they 
have to do is follow the "appropriate procedures". "It was 
suggested at the weekend that police knew the identities of the 
killers in the St James' Church massacre and other Cape attacks, 
but they could do nothing because the suspects were hiding in 
Transkei. The claims have now become less emphatic, and the 
police say they need to establish names and addresses of the 
suspects before they can start extradition proceedings. Really? 
Surely such formalities can be overcome in pursuit of dangerous 
killers now that Transkei will be rejoining South Africa in a 
parliamentary democracy in a few months' time." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  KwaZulu Government `No Right' To Buy Luxury Jet -- "The 
kwaZulu government would probably emerge looking better if it 
conceded that it bought the R(rand) 33 million luxury jet 
without serious thought about the implications," begins a page 6 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 4 January. "For 
one, the ownership of the plane was transferred when the kwaZulu 
government had only a few months of life left. From April 27 it 
ceases to exist." "KwaZulu has no right to take decisions for 
the new Natal regional government."

a technical-military meeting will be held in that country 
between the military leadership of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] on 10 
January. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, who is 
also the main mediator of the Lusaka talks, has said that the 
aforementioned meeting will have as its main point of agenda the 
cease-fire agreement which has already been discussed in the 
Zambian capital. Alioune Beye has also said that this meeting 
will depend on the agenda of the Lusaka talks, which, as we have 
just said, will begin on 5 January. The UN official revealed 
this at the end of his visit to Sao Tome and Principe, where he 
has met with President Miguel Trovoada, who is the current 
chairman of African Lusophone countries. 
  Trovoada has been concerned with the Angolan situation, and 
has on a number of occasions offered to mediate in the talks 
between UNITA and the MPLA-PT.

  [Excerpts] Alioune Blondin Beye this afternoon was at the 
Futungo de Belas to brief President of the Republic Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos on the Angolan peace process. As the Lusaka talks 
are scheduled to resume on 5 January, it has been reported that 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
delegation arrived in Kinshasa today on its way to the Zambian 
capital. Beye, however, did not confirm or deny the report, 
merely saying that all sides will be in Lusaka on 5 January 
ready to talk. 
  Before the start of the talks Chief Beye is scheduled to 
visit two countries and meet U.S. congressmen. He will go to 
Gabon and Zaire to brief the respective presidents on the state 
of the peace process. In view of Beye's tight schedule, the 
talks will start at 1600 on 5 January. 
  Beye said he took the opportunity during today's audience at 
the Futungo de Belas to greet the president of the Republic on 
the occasion of the new year. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, says Foreign 
Minister Venancio de Moura is on his to New York for a meeting 
with Butrus Butrus-Ghali at 2300 today. He will discuss the 
possibility of a new UN Angola Verification Mission mandate, the 
supervision of the cease-fire, and other aspects that are likely 
to be raised at the Lusaka talks. LUSA cites U.S. diplomatic 
sources in New York as confirming the meeting which is in the 
context of the establishment of peace in Angola.

In this way on 11 December 1993 it attempted the life of the

  [Text] In a communique issued by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] Armed Forces today through 
the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel, the Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] Command in the 
Northern Front categorically denies any attempt by its troops to 
attack or occupy any post under the control of the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] 
regime. From northern Angola, our correspondent Elevado Prata, 
reports about this and other issues: 
  [Begin Prata recording] The MPLA-PT government is already 
very advanced in the new political, diplomatic and military 
offensive, which it has been preparing for some time now against 
UNITA in its positions, in order to have a more advantageous 
position on the ground to force UNITA to sign a premature 
agreement of the controversial Angolan political and military 
situation. After preparing its military machinery in the 
Northern Front to launch an extensive operation in Ndalatando, 
(Songo), Soyo, Malanje, Uige and the Lunda Provinces, aimed at 
recovering those areas while the next Lusaka talks are underway 
-- contrary to the agreement to decrease military operations to 
avoid a more tense atmosphere at the negotiating table -- the 
MPLA-PT, with its ultra partisan army, the People's Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA], (?bent on) launching this 
offensive, has already begun its political and diplomatic 
offensive, by manipulating the information of the operations to 
confuse the Angolan and international public opinion. 
  Malongo in Cabinda Province, with [words indistinct] U.S. 
investments in the exploitation of oil, was the venue chosen by 
the Futungo de Belas Palace to deceive the Angolan and 
international community. However [words indistinct] (?U.S. 
Government against UNITA), since any attack on Malongo 
represents a danger to the lives of U.S. citizens residing in

Malongo, it would not only be to frighten the Malongo workers 
and the FAPLA soldiers stationed in the area, and the world 
knows this. If one of these days FALA attacks Malongo, it will 
be to occupy it and close this oil [words indistinct] to the 
Futungo de Belas Palace. 
  Meanwhile, regarding the fictitious attack on Malongo by our 
forces, we have contacted Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa, 
FALA's Northern Front commander, who denied any involvement of 
his forces in any sabotage action on Malongo. General Numa 
concluded his statements by saying that if his forces moved to

  [Text] The following is a communique just in from the 
General Staff of the FAA [Angolan Armed Forces]: 
  The FAA General Staff informs the public that National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces have stepped 
up their military operations throughout the country since the 
adjournment of the peace talks. UNITA operations include in 
particular the attack on the Malongo oil camp in Cabinda at dawn 
on 1 January, as well as an attack on an FAA logistics base in 
Malange, resulting in the death of two soldiers and material 
losses. 
  Also on 1 January, UNITA forces attacked Dange-ia-Manha 
location of Cuanza Norte Province, and shelled Menongue, using 
artillery. 
  On 2 January, UNITA attacked Quijenje location and shelled 
the capital of Ukuma District in Huambo Province. 
  Those operations are designed to bring about changes to the 
present correlation of military forces so as to gain advantages 
at the negotiating table. Yet, FAA forces are thwarting every 
UNITA plan by firmly defending their positions. 
  The FAA General Staff once again draws the attention of the 
international community to the fact that UNITA is responsible 
for the prevailing atmosphere of war in the country in that it 
does not adhere to the so-called unilateral cease-fire it 
declared on 20 September 1993, and is clearly committed to 
poisoning the Lusaka talks and undermining the peace process. 
Those designs ought to be condemned by public opinion as a 
whole. The FAA will remain firm in the defense of the people 
and democracy. 
  [Issued] The FAA General Staff in Luanda, 3 January

  [Excerpt] The Government of Cabinda Province today issued a 
communique accusing the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] of having shelled the 
installations of Cabinda Gulf, thereby hurting U.S. interests in 
Angola. The communique says the Republic of Zaire is behind the 
attack which is designed to destabilize the Angolan economy. 
The provincial government says the attack was carried out by a 
group of UNITA bandits coming from the Republic of Zaire. The 
communique adds that Cabinda residents have for a long time now 
distanced themselves from Jonas Savimbi's organization and urges 
them to close ranks with the Angolan Armed Forces and the 
national police. 
  The Cabinda Government urged the government of lower Zaire 
to 
adhere to international law so as to uphold peaceful coexistence 
and good neighborliness. 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Petroleum says the attack on 
Malongo did not in any way affect oil production. Petroleum 
Minister Albina Assis says the morale of workers is high.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], said in Maringue yesterday the process of 
confinement of his soldiers is running smoothly. Dhlakama said 
the Renamo soldiers are already in assembly points awaiting to 
enter the venues corresponding to the second stage. Dhlakama 
was speaking at a news conference granted to Mozambican and 
foreign journalists, and said that his troops are facing a 
situation of misery. He spoke once again about the alleged 
mismanagement by the UN Operations in Mozambique -- for carrying 
water in helicopters from the city of Beira to the Chiramba 
assembly point, for the blue helmets stationed in the area. 
Dhlakama said he has spoken with UN Special Representative Aldo 
Ajello, and added that the issue has already been reported in 
New York. In another development, Afonso Dhlakama said the 
issue of the Malawi Young Pioneers is Mozambique Liberation 
Front propaganda to denigrate Renamo.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] In Zimbabwe the dollar has been devalued by 17 
percent in readiness for fierce market competition expected from 
South Africa. Well, the other big money issue in Zimbabwe at 
the moment is a debate over who controls the economy. Many 
black business people complain that it is still controlled by a 
handful of whites and Asians. These racial overtones have been 
highlighted by outspoken speeches like the one by Vice President 
Joshua Nkomo recently. Now, an advert has appeared in the 
Sunday newspapers paid for by a local black businessman. The 
open letter is pretty hard hitting against the non-black 
business community and what it alleges is institutional racism 
in the financial sector, as Rachel Rawlings reports: 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] According to the advert, today 
over 99 percent of Zimbabwe's post independence economy remains 
dangerously controlled and dominated by a mere 20,000 white and 
Asian minority business community. The advert goes on to say, 
what is more, some of our own black brothers and sisters in 
positions of trust and responsibility run the serious risk of 
being used as Uncle Toms by those who would wish to use them in 
defense of institutionalized racism. It is in reply to an 
advert placed in THE HERALD newspaper by the Bankers and Finance 
Houses Associations of Zimbabwe, which tried to counter 
allegations that banks were unwilling to lend to the black or 
indigenous business community. Although many banking 
institutions here are headed by black Zimbabweans, the advert 
claims they have been subverted to the interests of the white 
community, using the example of an extended simile: When you 
have some coffee and when it is truly black and too strong, what 
do you do? Of course you integrate it with white milk, you make 
it weak. It used to be hot, now it becomes cold, it used to be 
strong, now it becomes weak. This is how our black brothers as 
Uncle Toms would have been rendered tame and lame by the 
traditionally all white bankers associations, whose banks and 
financial institutions continue to practice institutional racism 
against majority indigenous owned businesses. 
  The advert advocates militant measures: We can't tolerate 
any 
more of this misallocation of our resources when our children 
remain on the dump heap of unemployment. The people shall march 
on these banks and financial institutions to demonstrate against 
this continual indignity, wherever there are those who would 
continue to ignore the just aspiration of the 10 million blacks. 
The revolution toward indigenous economic empowerment can no 
longer be stopped or delayed, just as it was impossible to stop 
the Zimbabwe war of liberation. The advert comes at a time when 
the president has promised government will implement measures to 
help indigenous businesses and the government has issued a 
directive that 80 percent of shares in Stanbic Bank, Zimbabwe, 
should be owned by indigenous Zimbabweans. The strong words 
will raise the temperature of an already acrimonious debate in 
which race is playing an increasingly bitter part. [end

after security agents seized copies of a weekly news magazine

  [Text] A five-member board of inquiry into allegations of 
professional misconduct against five military officers who were 
overseeing the affairs of the states in November last year 
following the change of government was inaugurated in Lagos 
today. The states are Borno, Kano, Osun, Sokoto, and Yobe. The 
board of inquiry, set up by the Chief of General Staff, 
Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, was inaugurated on his behalf 
by the principal general staff officer at the General 
Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal O.J. Ehigie. State House 
correspondent Haruna Idris reports: 
  [Begin Idris recording] Lt. Gen. Diya said the panel was set 
up in view of the seriousness of the allegations and the 
administration's decision not to condone corruption at any 
level. He called on the members to abide by their terms of 
reference and not to succumb to any undue influence in the 
discharge of their task. The terms of reference of the board 
include: to inquire into all allegations of official misconduct 
leveled against the officers; to investigate allegations of 
aiding and abetting smuggling leveled against any of the 
officers; to identify those involved in the misconduct and the 
roles played by each and apportion blame. The board is also to 
recommend appropriate measures to be taken to prevent 
occurrences in the future and look into any other matters 
related to misapplication and misappropriation of public funds 
and property. Responding, the chairman of the board of inquiry, 
Brigadier General Oladapo Popoola, gave the assurance that 
members of the board will do their best and justify the 
confidence reposed in them. Other members of the board include: 
Navy Captain R.A. Asasa; Group Captain W.Pratt; Assistant 
Commissioner of Police Haziz Ringi; and Lieutenant Colonel Emi 
Juru who will serve as secretary. The board is expected to 
submit its report not later than 30 January this year. [end

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This country so much needs a 
fresh economic impetus and the dressing of the wounds inflicted 
by the social and political crisis that we have gone through. 
Father Christmas was around during the holiday celebrations and 
reminded us that besides economic recovery, we have an important 
exercise to undertake this year -- the legislative elections 
slated for 23 January and 6 February. This ballot is an 
important landmark for the continuity and success of the 
democratic process which must be marked this year by the 
creation of all the institutions of the Fourth Republic, which 
was ushered in by the constitutional referendum of September 
1992. The fact remains, however, that the upcoming legislative 
elections must be free and fair and must be held in an 
atmosphere of security for all. This is the best wish of 
President General Gnassingbe Eyadema. He stated this in a 
communique presented here by Adjobi Adjadaye. 
  [Begin Adjadaye recording] The president of the Republic has 
taken good note of the progress made in the preparations for the 
upcoming legislative elections. As he had already stated in his 
first message to the nation in the aftermath of his election as 
president, the head of state fervently wishes that all those who 
were not able to be part of the first stage of our democratic 
process take part in the second stage of national unity, so that 
together we can all take part in the legislative elections on 
the scheduled dates. 
  In this spirit the president indicated last November that it 
was necesary to take into consideration the opinions of French 
and German electoral experts. Also, to iron out difficulties and 
create a general atmosphere of trust, the president of the 
Republic has met several times with the International Monitoring 
Commission and the National Electoral Commission [CEN], the 
government officials charged with organizing the legislative 
elections. 
  All these efforts testify to the constantly renewed 
political 
will of the head of state to contribute to a peaceful conclusion 
of the democratic process within the strict respect of the 
Ouagadougou accord. This is why the president of the Republic 
once again invites the CEN and the government officials charged 
with organizing the legislative elections, and the political 
parties to double their efforts with a view to accelerating and 
contributing positively to the carrying out of material tasks so 
that the elections can be held in a free, fair and secure 
atmosphere for all. Our people have suffered for far too long 
from this long transition and it is our duty to move heaven and 
earth for the elections to take place at the scheduled dates so 
that we can get to work. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Georges Combevi Agbodjan, minister of </F>
territorial administration and security, in Lome on 2 January -- 
read by announcer] 
  [Text] The country has no time to lose if it wants to 
ensure that 1994 is a better year for all Togolese. All the 
conditions will be met so that the legislative elections can 
take place on 23 January and 6 February. Contrary to the 
statement of certain opposition parties claiming that the 
revision of voters registers is not yet complete and that the 
distribution of voters cards could not begin, the minister of 
territorial administration and security wishes to make the 
following clarifications: 
  The results of the revision of voters registers made by the 
administrative commissions, composed of representatives of all 
political parties legally constituted, were transmitted to the 
National Electoral Commission [CEN] on 31 December 1993. The 
electoral code stipulates that the National Electoral Commission 
will be responsible for the personification of voters cards 
while the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security 
will be responsible for their distribution. To accelerate these 
last two phases of the preparations for the legislative 
elections -- the personification and the distribution -- the CEN 
and the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security have 
adopted the procedure proposed by French and German experts 
permitting the simultaneous personification and distribution of 
the cards in the presence of voters. The structures set up in 
the electoral constituencies and polling stations will make it 
possible for all voters to withdraw their cards before 23 
January. 
  To this end, the minister of territorial administration and 
security requests the representatives of political parties, who 
are members of distribution commissions, to assist the chairmen 
of the local electoral committees and prefects. The government 
will do everything possible so that the legislative elections of 
23 January will be regular, democratic, open, and fair. 
  Signed by Georges Combevi Agbodjan.

  [Text] The Union for Democracy and Solidarity [UDS] 
confirms its nonparticipation in upcoming elections. In a 
communique published today and signed by its delegate general, 
Mr. Antoine Folly, the UDS said that in line with the decisions 
made on 23 November 1993 not to take part in the 23 January 1994 
legislative election in the current conditions, the party has 
not put forth a candidate to stand in that election and 
therefore no candidate can claim to have been mandated by the 
UDS. The UDS states, and I quote, it had set up conditions for 
its participation in a free and fair election and regrets that 
these conditions are not met.

  [Summary from poor reception] "The Congolese Armed Forces 
[FAC] held a ceremonial parade this afternoon under the 
chairmanship of Professor Pascal Lissouba, president of the 
Republic and commander in chief of the Armed Forces." After 
touching on the latest developments in the country, Defense 
Minister General Raymond Damase Ngollo stated "the Army's 
present position in the face of the political situation in our 
country." 
  [Begin recording] "This situation is a challenge to the top 
army hierarchy who, according to your directives, Mr. President, 
should have taken control of the (?field) since the early days 
of the crisis a little over a year ago." But we are prepared 
today "to assume our responsibilities." However, Mr. President 
of the Republic, it seems important to face the reality of our 
army. Three quarters of our army are made up of commissioned 
and noncommissioned officers. A divided army cannot take 
control of any situation, and that is deplorable. Since 1983 
there has been no (?jurisprudence) within the FAC, and the 
failure of the compulsory national service has contributed to 
worsening this situation. In terms of equipment and 
infrastructure, our army finds itself in (?an uncomfortable 
situation) in the face of lacking equipment and motivation. 
"The FAC (?is now passing through) an unprecedented stage. The 
commissioned and noncommissioned officers and the rank and file 
are left at the mercy of alliances. This, Mr. President, is the 
institution we have in hand to cope with our delicate mission 
which consists in "guaranteeing the security of persons and 
their property, ensuring security at the borders, and 
participating in the social and economic development effort." 
[end recording] 
  In his speech, Prof. Pascal Lissouba, commander in chief of 
the Armed Forces, declared that the FAC has to be recycled. We 
listen to him: 
  [Begin recording] Indeed, my general, as I stated a year 
ago, 
the Armed Forces are the only organized Congolese institution. 
Indeed, my general, we were somewhat disappointed. Indeed, my 
general, our country's social fabric, which disintegrated 
dangerously, did not spare this institution. This is why, my 
general, I urge our military attaches to work hard. The fact is 
simply that we will have to recycle everyone. We will have to 
review the men of your institution, because as you know it is 
more than three decades since Congo formed an army. But I do 
not believe that Congo could think that an army, just like an 
individual, is a machine. To operate it, you need to feed it 
from time to time. Surely, you do not only have to feed it with 
hope and aspiration but also spiritually and psychologically, 
for we should not forget that technology advances and methods 
change. Therefore, countrymen, your troops must equally follow 
the trend. 
  "How do we go about it? Perhaps, we have to hold some talks 
and discussions with the military attaches of friendly countries 
so that an effort may be made in order that -- like what occurs 
at the military academy where many of the attaches carry out 
their trade -- we may take a look at those of your colleagues 
who flank you and who also require recycling. This seems 
crucial when you begin to move forward at a great pace in 
implementing the ideas which you yourself outlined. Indeed, we 
did think of embarking on recruitment. But these will not be 
like those you have been accustomed to in the past. You are 
going to be in charge of these recruitments. You will do them 
in a national manner. In other words, you will go to every 
region of our country. I cannot spot the general in charge of 
the Gendarmerie. Oh yes, he is there. He has already begun a 
job which he showed to me, and I think I am expecting that of my 
general. These recruitments must not be made like the ones we 
were doing in the past. That is to say, we were making a 
selection and then finally we were among ourselves. You will 
have to recruit them from all over the republic." [end 
recording]

Ogoni People (MOSOP), a minority rights pressure group 
representing about 500,000 people. 
  Soldiers arrived Sunday morning at his residence in the oil 
city, surrounded the premises and prevented Saro-Wiwa from going 
out and receiving visitors, the reports said. Also held in the 
building with him were members of his family and some visitors 
who were there the previous night. 
  The telephone lines of Saro-Wiwa, a former president of the 
Association of Nigerian Authors, appeared to have been tampered 
with and AFP was unable to contact him on Tuesday morning. 
  Saro-Wiwa was detained for some two months last year by the 
previous military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for 
championing the cause of the Ogoni, who have in past years 
complained about what they describe as the neglect, injustice 
and degradation suffered by their community despite the fact 
that large amounts of crude oil, the mainstay of the economy, 
are produced in their area. The Ogonis are one of some 250 
ethnic groups in Nigeria. 
  Ledum Mitee, MOSOP deputy president, and Monday Wiwa, 
another 
MOSOP official, were a week ago led away by soldiers to an 
unknown destination, the reports said. Their arrests appeared 
related to the authorities' decision to abort the celebration of 
an "Ogoni week" scheduled to start on December 28 and to which 
Saro-Wiwa was invited as a guest speaker. 
  The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation 
for 
human rights groups, has condemned the arrests of these minority 
rights activists in a statement and called for their immediate 
release.

  [Excerpts] Between 2 and 3 January, though the populations 
of Isale and Mugongomanga had been celebrating happily, 64 
houses were set ablaze by the populations of the two communes 
who lived in total harmony last year. Christophe Nkurunziza 
visited Mugongomanga commune. 
  [Begin recording] [Nkurunziza] Bujumbura rural is a province 
which had become peaceful after the tragic events experienced in 
Burundi. However, after the New Year's festivities, a 
resurgence of violence has been seen in the communes of Isale 
and Mugongomanga. 
  The governor of the province of Bujumbura rural, Dr. Aloys 
Hakizimana, will give us the facts. [passage omitted] How many 
houses were burned, how many people died, and how many were 
injured? 
  [Hakizimana] According to a report sent to me by the head of 
the Kibuye Zone on 2 January 32 houses were burned down with 
five people seriously injured and one very seriously. Three of 
them were transferred to [words indistinct] Kamenge while 15 
others who were slightly injured were treated at the health 
center in Kibuye, and they have returned home. In Kibuye [words 
indistinct] we counted [words indistinct] 20 houses burned. In 
Mugongomanga, [words indistinct] reports of the commander of the 
district of Bujumbura say that ten houses were burned down. [end 
recording] 
  After investigations, the number of houses burned down is 
put 
at 12 for Mugongomanga, while 52 were burned down in Isale. The 
reported violence has an ethnic connotation. The governor of 
the province of rural Bujumbura has this to say: 
  [Begin Hakizimana recording] It is very clear. Mugongomanga 
Province is predominantly Tutsi while the Isale commune is 
predominantly Hutu. On both sides, in Mugongomanga and Isale, 
there are Hutu who fled some localities of Gisagwe where there 
were confrontations during the crisis. The second phase of the 
crisis was in Mugongomanga commune. In Mugongomanga there is a 
Tutsi population which was displaced, which fled Isale commune. 
So, it can be called ethnic. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Today is the second day of the general strike by 
civil servants of the public administration sector. The strike 
action, called by one of the two national trade unions, the 
Federation of Chadian Trade Unions, is being widely followed. 
Here in Ndjamena the administration has been completely 
paralyzed. Civil servants embarked on this strike action to 
back their demand for their salaries, which they have not 
received for several months. 
  In its recent petition to the government, the main trade 
union federation called for the payment of two months of salary 
arrears to civil servants working in Ndjamena and three months 
of salary arrears to their counterparts in the provinces; the 
regularization of the financial situation of workers who were 
arbitrarily retired but later rehabilitated by the National 
Salvation Council; and the regular payment of salaries and 
allowances as of January, just to mention a few of the demands. 
  This strike action, which started yesterday, will end on 8 
January, but may be renewed if demands are not met by then.

  [Text] His Excellency Arturo Avello Diez del Corral, 
ambassador of Spain to Equatorial Guinea, returned to Malabo on 
2 January from Madrid with a message from Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez to President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. The Spanish 
envoy, who was called for consultations by his government, left 
for Spain on 12 December following the expulsion of the Spanish 
consul in Bata. The consul was declared persona non grata after 
holding an eight-hour meeting on 10 December with the political 
parties that did not take part in the 21 November legislative 
elections. At the meeting, the Spanish consul supported [words 
indistinct] of violence likely to jeopardize the order, peace, 
and tranquility prevailing in the country. Despite this act, 
considered as interference and a provocation, the Equatorial 
Guinean Government has continued to maintain good relations with 
Spain since that country decided unilaterally to (?reduce) its 
cooperation with Equatorial Guinea. This decision was followed 
by the departure of a large number of Spanish technical staff 
from our country. The Equatorial Guinean people, who are aware 
of the importance of the ties between them and Spain, hope that 
the contents of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's message are 
positive and promising. In fact, that is the wish of all the 
sons of this country.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] believes that 
the establishment of transitional institutions should take 
place as soon as possible. Otherwise its presence in Kigali is 
pointless. This is stated in a communique of the RPF issued this 
afternoon during a press conference held by the front's 
president, Alexis Kanyarengwe at the Amaryambere Hotel in 
Kimihurura. In the communique, read by the party's president, 
the RPF gives its views on some of the problems in the setting 
up of the broad-based institutions and stresses that it will not 
tolerate the results of political maneuvers. Here is Colonel 
Kanyarengwe. 
  [Begin Kanyarengwe recording] [Words indistinct] declares 
that it will not at all tolerate any results reached by 
political maneuvers aimed at substituting other lists of 
deputies for the one initially selected in the framework of 
setting up institutions on the 37th day after the date of the 
signing of the Arusha peace agreement. 
  The RPF also declares that it does not accept the last 
minute 
change of heart of parties such as the Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic [CDR] which had publicly declared that it would 
not take part in the transitional national assembly and 
therefore had not nominated its deputies. [passage omitted] 
  Any authority, individuals or parties who neglect their role 
in the setting up of the institutions will be responsible for 
the consequences which may result from the situation. This call 
is made particularly to the president of the Republic who should 
be the first person to make himself available for the 
swearing-in ceremonies of the deputies of the transitional 
assembly and members of the government team. The pursuit of 
maneuvers aimed at [word indistinct] a minority the blockade of 
institutions in favor of the president of the Republic and his 
party, obliges the RPF to declare to the national and 
international opinions that its presence in Kigali is pointless. 
[passage omitted] 
  Our position is clear (?and it is the following): We did not 
come here to play around or to watch a play. We are here to 
work, we are not here on holiday. This is in summary the 
meaning of the declaration. We are here to work. If you will 
allow it, we are available. If there are other intentions, 
[words indistinct] what else can you reproach the RPF with, of 
not having done? We are here in the capital. So why are we 
here? I put this question to you journalists. What is the 
purpose? To tolerate the whim of your president? No. [end

<F P=106> [Address by President Mobutu Sese Seko in Kinshasa on 4 </F>
January on the occasion of Martyrs' Day -- live] 
  [Text] Very dear compatriots, at the beginning of this new 
year, I want to express my best wishes of happiness, health, and 
prosperity to the entire Zairian people and the various foreign 
communities established in our country. I wish a prompt 
recovery to all the hospitalized and ill members of our families 
and eternal rest to those we are mourning. 
  Dear compatriots, according to the tradition, it was on the 
night of 31 December 1993 that I should have expressed these 
wishes to you, but I opted to do it today, on the anniversary of 
our independence martyrs, for I want them to witness this. What 
was the purpose of all the sufferings they endured, even to the 
point of sacrificing their lives? Actually, it was to make 
independent Zaire a stable and prosperous country, where all 
citizens enjoy happiness. As one who was personally involved in 
their struggle, first as a participant in the January 1960 
political roundtable meeting, and second as a member of the 
first government of the First Republic, and finally as one who 
continues their work, I cannot, in my capacity as head of state, 
remain indifferent to the disastrous situation prevailing in the 
country. Today's address gives me the opportunity to take stock 
of the state of the nation in order to draw a conclusion and the 
true consequences of almost four years of hesitation and 
confusion. 
  Dear compatriots, in April, it will be four years since 
Zaire 
has been mired in an endless transition toward the Third 
Republic. Four years -- it is the duration of a presidential 
term of office and of a full legislature in certain countries. 
The year 1993 began with the (?28) January tragic lootings and 
ended in an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis which has become 
worse over the last months. I know the considerable sacrifices 
this crisis cost us, mainly as a result of the political 
instability prevailing in the country. I also know the 
humiliation suffered by our ambassadors and diplomats abroad as 
a result of many months of salary arrears. The new zaire 
currency on which we were supposed to found our most realistic 
hopes is already facing regrettably serious difficulties hardly 
two months after its creation. The four-figure inflation rate 
is an alarming sign of the situation of our national production 
and then there is the issue of the skyrocketing prices of 
essential commodities. 
  As a consequence, your country Zaire has lost its good image 
while a look of general distress can be seen on the face of our 
compatriots. Dear fellow citizens, in all the years I have been 
leading the destiny of this country, I have never witnessed such 
an acute social crisis that does not spare any social class. 
Indeed, it is unacceptable that in this beautiful and rich 
country, cassava, rice, peanut, and sugar -- which are local 
products -- should go from 250 to 2500 new zaire in only a 
month. That is an increase of 500 percent. In the same vein, 
it is regrettable that the most elementary drugs should be out 
of the reach of modest families; that patients in possession of 
a medical prescription should be unable to get the prescribed 
drugs. Finally, what about the endless lines at the fuel 
stations, and the distressing spectacle of city dwellers walking 
from their homes to their place of work? 
  Zaire is projecting the image of a country where poverty and 
confusion prevail to such an extent that prices change following 
mere circumstances. It can be in the morning, at noon, or in 
the evening. In a word, Zaire appears today as a country 
without a state, and its population as a completely disoriented 
group of people without leadership; outlaws without any central 
authority. 
  My dear compatriots, if economy is vital for a country, the 
prevailing political climate remains the determining factor of 
its prosperity. In the face of the current situation of chaos 
and misery, only one word comes to our minds: Enough is enough. 
From now on, we should strive to make 1994 a year during which 
a genuine national policy of redress will be initiated. I will 
fully assume my responsibilities in order to make 1994 a year of 
stabilization for our institutions and rehabilitation of our 
country whose vocation remains to be a rich and powerful country 
as well as an important economic and sociocultural focal center 
in Africa and in the world. 
  This policy of national reparation should be considered the 
duty of us all; a challenge each of us faces. It is a challenge 
for all socioprofessional categories -- politicians, financial 
backers, agricultural workers -- in a word, everybody; from the 
medical doctor to the medical auxilliary, from the engineer to 
the worker, from the managing director and general secretary to 
the bailiff, from the general to the soldier, from the 
university lecturer to the student, even from the pastor and the 
priest to the parishioner. All of us should come to our senses. 
Each of us should assume his responsibility in his own field of 
activity and resolutely engage on the path of national redress. 
  Dear compatriots, now that we have conducted this in-depth 
analysis, I would like to particulary call on the military and 
the politicians. There was a time when the Zairian military was 
the object of our pride. I myself shared this legitimate pride 
for an army that I created from scratch. The army had at its 
disposal for its training, officers of great value, trained in 
the best military academies from all over the world: Belgium, 
China, Korea, Egypt, the United States of America, France, 
Israel, just to name a few. Our military operations in Chad, 
Togo and Rwanda, had forced admiration and respect for our Armed 
Forces. But our army has lost all this today because of a 
campaign of political disinformation that has dangerously 
threatened all spirit of discipline, civic-mindedness, 
patriotism, all qualities that make an army great. 
  The sad lootings perpetrated in 1991 and those that 
followed, 
are a regrettable illustration of this situation. Since these 
unfortunate events, observers are attributing all the 
misfortunes of Zaire to the military. This is just too bad. 
The military should be aware of the fact that its contribution 
is essential to the policy of national reparation. Its role is 
to ensure order, peace as well as the security of the people and 
their possessions. This is essential to the survival of the 
nation itself. That is why, I hereby call on the military to be 
from now on wary of demagogic and corrupt politicians who are 
intent on sowing confusion and who, under the cover of the 
night, distribute subversive and seditious leaflets in barracks, 
inciting soldiers to rise against the authorities and the 
established order. The same politicians -- when the day comes 
-- are the ones who denigrate our Armed Forces and call on 
foreign troops. 
  As for the politicians, I am convinced that only one logic 
thought should now prevail in our minds: The organization of 
elections. Elections that should be scheduled as soon as 
possible, elections before anything else. Indeed, I believe 
that the Zairian people need, more than ever, to be led by their 
own representatives, that is, men and women whom they trust. 
  Dear fellow citizens, I hereby make an urgent call on the 
politicians, in particular on those who negotiated at the 
People's Palace, to meet again in order to draw up practical 
modalities for the signing of the agreements reached after their 
own consultations in order to enable the formation of a new 
government before 12 January, a deadline I consider as the only 
acceptable one that should not be exceeded. The political 
consultation that took place at the People's Palace and that 
lasted several weeks, resulted in several agreements. Everybody 
agrees in Zaire that this was an honorable compromise that can 
serve as an acceptable basis for a constructive, peaceful and a 
consensual transition. The documents on the negotiations have 
the great advantage of being in line with all the positive 
aspects of the previous documents, notably that of the Sovereign 
National Conference and the Kinshasa Political Conclave. 
Therefore, they constitute an asset for all of us. Each party 
has taken into account the concerns of the others; each party 
has made concessions and all this in the interest of Zaire and 
its people. 
  The special emissary of the United Nations secretary 
general, 
Mr. Lakhdar Braimi, has said that these accords were positive. 
The French and Belgian ambassadors, as well as the charge 
d'affaires of the United States, who came to see me in Gbadolite 
on 10 December 1993, expressed on behalf of their governments 
their wish to see Zairian politicians sign these accords 
quickly. On this point, in order to guarantee a good conclusion 
to the implementation of these accords, Monsignor Monsengwo and 
the special emissary of the UN general secretary informed me 
that the two sides involved in the negotiations had expressed 
the wish that I should be more involved in these accords by 
signing them also. Without hesitation, I agreed in principle, 
but I am still waiting to be told where and when the signing 
ceremony will be held. This is why I am calling on politicians 
not to look in the the direction of the past that divided us, 
but to be involved, without afterthought or veto, in what unites 
us henceforth. 
  On my part, I reconfirm once again and solemnly my 
determination to favor the pursuit and the conclusion of the 
democratization process which I personally initiated on 24 April 
1990. It is for this reason that I declare my preparedness to 
sign immediately the accords that were concluded at the People's 
Palace. 
  My dear compatriots, the implementation of the People's 
Palace accords should rapidly lead us, as I have just recalled, 
to the formation of a government that will rightfully reflect 
this new spirit of confidence and cooperation. It will be a 
representative government and sufficiently balanced in its 
composition where each side will be represented. During the 
negotiations, I carefully avoided intervening but I just said 
that I will accept unreservedly any prime minister that will 
bring back the consensus of the political class. I also said 
and reaffirmed more than once that I have no objection that the 
future prime minister should come from the opposition and that 
it was even my wish that it be so. The new government should be 
organized and should function in conformity with the letter and 
the spirit of the People's Palace accords, especially the 
special arrangement relating to the equal and balanced sharing 
of power. 
  My dear compatriots, I have just defined to you the advanced 
stage of the degradation of our country's economic and social 
situation as well as the liquefaction of the authority of the 
state and the loss of Zaire's international prestige. This 
situation is due to the persistence of a confused political 
situation. This is why, without hesitating, I had to give 
precise guidelines to pull the country out of this impasse. 
  To conclude this message, I remind everyone that: First, I 
have announced to the nation that henceforth Zaire is resolutely 
committed to the irreversible logic of elections. Everything 
will be done so that these elections are free, democratic, and 
fair all levels -- presidential, legislative, municipal, and 
local. These elections will be held before 31 December. Steps 
are also being taken to assure that international organizations 
as well as certain bodies that are specialized in elections can 
assist us. Second, I asked the negotiators at the People's 
Palace to sign without delay the accords that resulted from 
their own discussions. The deadline given to them to conclude 
this matter cannot go beyond eight days. Third, after this 
deadline, I will assume my responsibilities, all my 
responsibilities as head of state and guarantor of the nation. 
  My dear compatriots, with a deep faith in the future of a 
great, prosperous, and worthy Zaire, I will like to express my 
wish that the new year brings hope for the happy conclusion of 
the democratic process to which we all are strongly committed. 
Happy New Year 1994!

  [Text] The closing ceremony of the October 1993 
parliamentary budget session took place yesterday at the Palace 
of the Nation with Maneng Makong, second deputy speaker of the 
National Assembly, in the chair. Among issues raised were the 
1994 appropriations bill and the validation of powers for 
hearing the reports of parliamentary audit missions. The 
ceremony offered an opportunity for deputies to recall the 
country's political and social situation. Here is our report: 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The October 1993 
session which closed on 3 January was not characterized by 
intense activity, as was the case in the past owing to the 
country's general political climate and the failure of the 
government to present the 1994 appropriations bill in a timely 
maaner. To date the bill has not yet been presented at the 
National Assembly. It would have provided answers to queries 
from deputies by explaining how the people's confidence in the 
state is going to be stimulated and enabling the effective 
revamping of the country's economic activities. All that the 
National Assembly had to do was to place on record a bitter note 
of the situation in view of the serious budgetary legislation 
lapses for the 1994 financial year. 
  Second Deputy Speaker Maneng Makong stressed that the 
monetary reform which had at the time been considered inevitable 
has just experienced a boomerang that has been sharply felt 
among all the social strata. He also spoke of the actions taken 
by parliament both inside and outside the country. The National 
Assembly was not indifferent to the unfortunate bloody coup 
attempt in Burundi and the death of President Felix 
Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire. Turning to the crisis in this 
transition period, the second deputy speaker observed that 
people had confused democracy with anarchy and democratic 
process with revolutionary process. To resolve this crisis, 
Zairian politicians must strive to draft the constitution of the 
Third Republic within the shortest possible time. Mr. Maneng 
Makong concluded with biblical verses as a way of appealing to 
the conscience of all politicians. [end recording]

the problem is not the political situation in Eritrea. [passage 
omitted] Even if the jihad movement objectives are to intensify 
religion in Eritrea, we are not new believers. Religion has 
strong roots in our society. [passage omitted] We should not 
see this new incident as a problem because this issue is not the 
problem of Eritrea. It is a problem that is coming from outside 
Eritrea. 
  What we should understand is that this issue is of a foreign 
origin. There is no reason for foreigners to come and fight 
here. The objective is to destabilize the prevailing peace and 
stability of the region. [passage omitted] It is not a big 
threat to us. Our fear is that we do not want the existing 
relationship we have with our neighbors to be affected as a 
result of the prevailing situation. 
  [Reporter] Eritrea is one of the countries of the region 
which is actively working to safeguard peace and stability in 
our region. If we turn to the question of Sudan, Eritrea is one 
of the countries which is working hard to solve the problem of 
southern Sudan peacefully, so why is Sudan taking a hostile 
stance? 
  [Isayas] It is not a secret that the Sudanese Government and 
its political forces are the ones who are supporting them by 
giving them space to (?organize). It is also no secret that the 
(?movement) is supported by forces from other regions. It is 
difficult to name them and they are not officially connected 
with countries. However, it is not the right time to name them. 
The war was declared a long time ago. We could have responded 
negatively, but this is not our wish, because the consequences 
would be very bad. [passage omitted] 
  Despite all these things, we will not stop supporting Sudan 
or strengthening our relations with Sudan. We will continue to 
maintain our tolerant relationship with Sudan. Those who are 
actively involved in the jihad movement are the frustrated ones. 
If the movement had the people's support it could have not 
declared such a war against the people. 
  [Reporter] There are some forces who want to destabilize the 
stability of this region using religion as a cover. The jihad 
in Eritrea is coming from Sudan. Kenya and Ethiopia are said to 
have the same problem. Is there any plan to solve this common 
problem jointly? 
  [Isayas] Our policy is to include these matters in our 
bilateral relations, and we will continue to do so. It is 
appropriate to issue this message on the regional and 
international level. Since the problem is coming from Sudan, we 
will try to solve it with Sudan. If other countries are facing 
the same problem, then I think those countries should also try 
to solve it on the same basis. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
called for more efforts to be directed towards soil conservation 
and protection of water catchment areas throughout the country. 
President Moi observed that water levels in many rivers have 
been reduced as a result of land degradation and destruction of 
water catchment areas. The president noted that unless water 
was conserved all forms of life would perish, and added that it 
was a responsibility of everyone to conserve the natural 
resources. 
  He noted that environmental protection should be uppermost 
in 
the development agenda, from the locational to the district 
level and urged forest officers to emphasize it. He also called 
on agricultural extension officers to teach farmers how to dig 
bench terraces where the land was steep. The president further 
noted the wealth of the community depended on natural resources 
and hence there was a need to protect it. President Moi was 
speaking at various places when he made an extensive tour of 
southern and central Baringo. [passage omitted] 
  Noting that the country was facing food shortages, the 
president advised Kenyans to exercise a spirit of being mindful 
of each other, whereby those who have should help the others. 
He at the same time assured wananchi [citizens] that the 
government will do its best to see that no one goes without 
food. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The period for the United Somali Congress [USC] 
Central Committee ran up to 5 July 1993, which coincided with 
the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] forces' attack on the 
Somali National Alliance [SNA]. For this reason it became 
necessary to delay for another six months, and to hold the USC 
congress at that time, according to its constitution, said the 
USC secretary general, who was also the chairman of the USC 
mini-congress held in Mogadishu today. 
  The mini-congress was attended by members of the USC 
executive committee, USC central committee members, members of 
the USC permanent committee, delegates of the USC communities, 
women's organizations, youth council representatives and 
religious leaders of the USC and other invited guests. 
  First, Mr. Abd-al-Karim Ahmed Ali [USC secretary general] 
delivered a speech and spoke about the problems encountered by 
the USC in the last two and a half years. The participants all 
voted unanimously in favor of the USC central committee and the 
chairman holding office for a further six months. [passage 
omitted] 
  They decided to extend the period for the USC central 
committee by six months. The mini-congress opened at 1000, 
there was a break at 1300 and it resumed at 1330. [passage 
omitted] Three hundred and six participants and invited guests 
expressed their support for the decision at the conclusion of 
the meeting at 1500 with applause. Mr. Abd-al-Karim Ahmed Ali 
closed the meeting by promising to meet the heavy responsibility 
properly and he prayed that God would help them. He said that 
the proceedings of the congress will be reported to Mr. Mohamed 
Farah Aidid, the USC chairman, on whose behalf he was speaking.

  [Text] The Supreme Court confirmed this officially in 
Conakry last night: Outgoing President Lansana Conte has indeed 
been re-elected as early as the first round of the presidential 
elections, which took place last month. The opposition, which 
claimed to have won or at least enough to get a second round, 
has not convinced the judges. Nicolas Balique reports: 
  [Balique] The outgoing president received 51.70 percent of 
the votes, while his main rival, Alpha Conde, got 19.55 percent. 
Ba Mamadou and Siradiou Diallo each received 13 and 12 percent, 
respectively. Among the other four candidates on the lists, 
only Facine Toure gets more than 1 percent. The opposition's 
appeals, which denounced manipulations and massive rigging, have 
been rejected. 
  However, the Supreme Court has accepted President Conte's 
request: It cancelled the results in Kankan and confirmed the 
invalidation of Siguiri, two departments of High Guinea where 
Alpha Conde received many votes. The opposition has recalled 
that without this decision, President Conde would have had to 
stand again. The next stage of the democratization process is 
the legislative elections. The date has not been set yet, but 
according to the Guinean electoral code, it is to be published 
70 days before the poll. Nicolas Balique, Dakar, RFI. 
  Lamine Sidime, the first president of the Supreme Court in 
Conakry, is satisfied with the way the elections took place. He 
spoke to Serge Daniel: 
  [Begin recording] [Sidime] I would also like to emphasize 
the 
joy and the cheerfulness with which the citizens of this country 
went to ballot boxes. They did so with true cheerfulness, 
notwithstanding, of course, damaged ballot boxes and equipment 
here and there. With a 78 percent turnout, I think that it is a 
record, and it is encouraging for democracy in Africa. [end

  [Text] The panel to reorganize and reform the operations 
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, was 
inaugurated today by the head of state, General Sani Abacha. 
State House correspondent Oje Ogbonaya Oje reports that the 
panel has four months to carry out its assignment: 
  [Begin recording] [Oje] Inaugurating the 10-man panel, Gen. 
Abacha said that the effort was part of the renewed 
determination of government to restore the confidence of the 
people in the operations of public institutions and agencies. He 
said that the organization of strategic institutions was a 
priority to his administration as contained in his maiden 
broadcast to the nation. The head of state expressed deep 
concern over the situation in the NNPC. He said in the past 10 
years the problem in the organization had risen to a situation 
when an average Nigerian legitimately wonder and complain as to 
why the country's earnings had not been reflected in the 
provision of social amenities to raise the people the people's 
standard of living. The head of state said that since the 
petroleum industry remained a major source of government income, 
all appropriate measures would be used to sanitize the NNPC and 
ensure discipline and prudence in the management of its 
operations. Gen. Abacha then outlined the assignment of the 
10-man panel: 
  [Abacha] To examine thoroughly the present structure, 
organization, and functions of the NNPC and make appropriate 
recommendations for improvement, and where deemed necessary, 
total overhaul; to scrutinize all payments of 1 million naira 
and above made by NNPC in the past three years to ascertain that 
the payments were made in accordance with laid down procedures, 
and where any of the payments were made under a contract that 
all such payments were in conformity with the terms of the 
contract; to identify all recipients of any regular or 
irregular, improper payments or proper, and the amounts 
involved, and suggest for effective and speedy restitution; to 
make recommendations for the improvement of payment procedures 
to prevent future occurrences of irregular and improper 
payments; to examine all major projects currently being executed 
by the NNPC with a view to ascertaining the relevance of each of 
those projects to the operations of the corporation and the 
development needs of the Nigerian economy -- for each such 
project, the panel should identify all amounts already expended 
and outstanding commitments due on the project [and]; to comment 
and recommend on any matter considered relevant to the NNPC 
(?with) particular regard to the smooth, efficient, and prudent 
operation of the corporation. 
  [Oje] The head of state urged the panel to carry out its 
assignment with all seriousness and sincerity of purpose. 
  Responding, the chairman of the panel, retired Major General 
Emmanuel (Adesoye) gave assurance that the panel was ready to 
carry out its duties. Maj. Gen. (Adesoye) however expressed 
reservation over the four-month deadline given to the panel to 
submit its report. All the members of the panel were present at 
the inauguration. [end recording]

  [Text] The Federal Government's budget for this year is to 
be based on a projected oil price of $14 per barrel, as against 
$17.4 last year. This follows the drop in the price of oil to 
$13 per barrel by the end of last year. The military 
administrator of Sokoto State, Colonel Yakubu Muazu, announced 
this late after the meeting of the Provisional Ruling Council 
and the military administrators yesterday in Lagos. He said 
that the government is aiming at a balanced or zero budget this 
year. Col. Muazu stated that monetary and fiscal measures to 
boost the economy, such as the avoidance of extra-budgetary 
allocations, were also discussed. He also said the government 
would take measures to curb inflation and the boost the value of 
the naira. The administrator stressed the need for Nigerians to 
work harder and exercise financial discipline this year to 
complement the government's economic revival measures. The 
meeting of the administrators is continuing today in Lagos.

government. The secretary general of the Nigerian Legion, 
Captain John Adoli, disclosed this in Lagos today at a news 
conference to mark this year's Remembrance Emblem (?Action) 
Week. Capt. Adoli appealed to the government to take over their 
sponsorship as the only solution.

  [Text] Two towns in Pendembu came under heavy rebel attack 
this morning. According to the military assistant, Department 
of Defense, Captain Amadu Koromah, the first rebel attack was 
launched on Mandoworo, northwest of Pendembu by some 200 rebels 
who were repelled by government troops after a four and a half 
hour battle. Initial reports put rebel losses at five dead but 
the final figure will be higher as a mopping up operation is now 
under way. 
  A combined force of National Patriotic Front of Liberia, 
NPFL, and RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels also launched 
a heavy attack on Jene, east of Pendembu. Reinforcements have 
been sent to the area, SLENA [SIERRA LEONE NEWS AGENCY] reports. 
  In another related development, rebels again launched 
another 
fierce attack on Joru, 18 miles from Kenema, on Sunday [2 
January]. Joru is the headquarter town Guala, Mende chiefdom. 
According to government information services, the rebels 
bypassed (Bari Serabu), 2 1/2 miles to Joru, following 
government troops' defensive posture. Military sources say the 
battle at Joru was the heaviest since the rebel incursion in 
that area. The rebels were, however, repelled but passed 
through Gboyama village where they are believed to have set fire 
on several houses.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 5 SAPA -- The goverment is to study the 
contents of a statement by the Freedom Alliance [FA] on Tuesday 
saying constitutional amendments affecting regions could still 
secure its participation in the April 27 election. "The 
government has received the response of the Freedom Alliance to 
the proposals of the South African Government/ANC [African 
National Congress] of 21 December 1993," a statement by Deputy 
Constitutional Development Minister Fanus Schoeman said on 
Wednesday. 
  He added the government aimed to arrange talks between 
itself, the African National Congress and the Freedom Alliance 
early next week to discuss the response of the FA. 
  The Freedom Alliance on Tuesday responded to the December 21 
government/ANC proposal by stating the FA had already committed 
itself to an all-inclusive agreement through peaceful 
negotiations if its amendments to the constitution were included 
in a minimum package. The FA said its constitutional proposals 
included provisions for self-determination of peoples on a 
territorial basis; the powers, functions and financial affairs 
of provinces; and separate ballot papers for elections for 
different levels of government.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 4 SAPA -- The Freedom Alliance [FA] 
on Tuesday stopped short of committing itself to the April 27 
election but said constitutional amendments affecting regions 
could still secure its participation. The FA -- a conservative 
grouping that includes the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the Conservative Party, 
Bophuthatswana and the Ciskei -- was responding to a 
government/ANC [African National Congress] proposal that the FA 
commit itself to the electoral process ahead of changes to the 
constitution. The proposal was made in talks between the three 
groupings on December 21 last year. 
  In a statement issued a day after FA leaders met in 
Pretoria, 
the FA said it had already committed itself to an all-inclusive 
agreement through peaceful negotiations if its amendments to the 
constitution were included in a minimum package. It urged 
government and the ANC to proceed immediately with negotiations 
on its proposals. 
  The statement said its constitutional proposals included 
provisions for self-determination of peoples on a territorial 
basis; the powers, functions and financial affairs of provinces; 
and separate ballot papers for elections for different levels of 
government. "The issue of a single ballot paper specifically 
undermines the democratic foundations of the system of 
proportional representation and the individual voter's right to 
choose. 
  "The FA and its leaders reiterate that for any such 
agreement 
to be reached, it should immediately be effected through formal 
amendments to the constitution of 1993, failing which agreement 
and/or consequent implementation, there cannot be any 
commitment."

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 4 SAPA -- The South African Defence 
Force's [SADF] first volunteer intake after the scrapping of 
white-only conscription last year will sign up at recruiting 
centres throughout the country on February 4. 
  SADF spokesman Maj Frank Halforty told SAPA on Tuesday the 
requirement for 1994 was 5,000 volunteers. If this figure could 
not be attained, an electronic ballot draft system would be 
applied to school leavers to make up for the shortfall. 
However, at this stage it appeared the target of 5, 000 
volunteers would be reached. He said 200 of the volunteers 
would go to the navy and the rest would be mustered into the 
army unless the air force required volunteer manpower. 
  The new volunteer intake would be recruited over two to 
three 
days, Maj Halforty said. He added the basic standards 
applicable to national servicemen of old, such as basic 
educational qualifications and health requirements, would apply 
to volunteer recruits of all races. When asked whether recruits 
would be expected to answer questions about military experience 
gained in formations such as Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing], Maj Halforty said he did not think 
this would be the case. 
  He said the volunteers would be required to complete a 
year's 
full-time military service after which they would have to attend 
eight 30-day camps spread over eight years.

  [Text] Britain is to reestablish military contact with 
South Africa after a break of more than 25 years with a visit of 
a royal navy war ship and support vessel this month. The 
British Ministry of Defense said in London that it hoped the 
goodwill visit by HMS Norfolk, the first of the navy's most 
up-to-date type 23 frigates, would boost Britain's chances of 
selling military equipment, particularly naval vessels, to South 
Africa. The Norfolk and its support vessel, Grey Wilbur, will 
visit Cape Town and Simonstown from 27 to 31 January.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 5 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has set up its own commission of inquiry to 
investigate the deaths of four people on the East Rand, 
allegedly at the hands of self-defence units [SDU]. 
  At a news conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday, ANC 
officials admitted some SDUs had been infiltrated by 
undisciplined elements, out to kill unit commanders and harass 
communities. ANC PWV [Pretoria - Witwatersrand - Vereeniging] 
General Secretary Oped Bapela said because the SDUs had been set 
up by communities, they had not previously been accountable to 
the ANC. But the time had come for the ANC to protect the 
community by becoming directly involved in the units. 
  The ANC PWV regional office had stepped in as soon as it had 
been alerted to continuous gunfire between SDU members of 
Mavimbela and Ncala sections in Katlehong on the East Rand at 
the weekend. There had been no similar occurences since Sunday, 
Mr Bapela said. 
  He said the four deaths of SDU members and Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] commanders last 
week had been caused by malicious rumour-mongering and character 
assassination of local leaders. Some SDU members had acted 
emotionally without establishing facts. 
  Guidelines for SDU restructuring had been drawn up at an 
urgent 10-hour meeting of the ANC, SA [South African] National 
Civics Organisation, SA Communist Party, SDU commanders and 
other involved parties on Tuesday. It had been agreed people 
joining SDUs would be screened carefully and those not living in 
the township should not be allowed to become involved. 
  For the first time, SDUs would have to be accountable to the 
ANC, which would control their activities through a 
newly-established monitoring committee. All fighting parties 
agreed to a formal ceasefire and that the highly-charged 
Mavimbela SDU would be disbanded temporarily during 
investigations and restructuring, Mr Bapela said. He assured 
the media the investigation into the deaths would be honest and 
no incriminating facts would be swept under the carpet. He did 
not rule out the possibility of handing suspects over to the 
[words indistinct] Internal Stability Unit was withdrawn from 
townships.

  [Text] Umkhonto we Sizwe's [Spear of the Nation, African 
National Congress (ANC) Military Wing] Rashid Patel says members 
of the first intake to the proposed peace force will begin 
training within two weeks. 
  Patel says the ANC will resist any attempt to convert the 
South African Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] into 
the national peace force. The ANC has been calling for the 
ISD's removal from townships, but law and order spokesman 
Captain Craig Kotze says the proposal to convert the ISD is 
likely to be tabled after a defense subcouncil meeting for the 
TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. That meeting will discuss 
the composition of the force and its command council.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 5 SAPA -- South African Council of 
Churches secretary general the Rev Frank Chikane has been 
nominated by the ANC's [African National Congress] PWV [Pretoria 
- Witwatersrand - Vereeniging] region as a candidate for the 
National Assembly. 
  Announcing this on Wednesday, the African National Congress 
said its members and those of the mass democratic movement had 
nominated Dr Chikane out of recognition for the contribution he 
had made in working for a just and non-racial society. However, 
because of his appointment as a member of the Independent 
Elections Commission he was not eligible to stand election. 
  The ANC and Dr Chikane had agreed that his name would be 
removed with immediate effect from all nominations lists, either 
for the National Assembly or for any of the provincial 
parliaments, the statement said.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has slammed 
Radio 702 for broadcasting what it calls misinformation from one 
of the government's dirty tricks departments. Spokesman Carl 
Niehaus was referring to reports that ANC Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa had bought a farm in the eastern Transvaal. 
Niehaus says such reports are unfounded and he says it's the 
media's duty to avoid being used to disseminate deliberate 
misinformation. 
  [Niehaus] We are concerned that Radio 702 allowed such a 
campaign to be carried on the air virtually throughout the day 
and it took them over four hours before they approached the 
African National Congress for any comment. The ANC believes 
that this places a serious responsibility on the media not to 
run such dubious stories without checking and double checking 
their authenticity.

  [Text] Durban Jan 4 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party's 
central committee is unlikely to take a final decision on 
whether it will contest the April 27 election when it meets in 
Ulundi at the weekend. IFP sources told SAPA on Tuesday the 
meeting was "routine" and while it would discuss the latest 
constitutional developments and a possible general conference to 
decide on its stance towards elections, final decisions would 
probably be made only later this month. 
  IFP central committee member Walter Felgate said the Freedom 
Alliance -- which includes the IFP -- met on Monday to draw up a 
response to a government and African National Congress [ANC] 
document on the current deadlock with the alliance. The response 
had been sent to the ANC and government on Tuesday morning and 
would be made available to the public as soon as a reply had 
been received. 
  He said the IFP could hold a special conference to decide 
its 
election stance only "once we have the best we can negotiate in 
hand". The party's decision to participate in elections could 
not be made by the central committee alone but needed a special 
conference to canvass grassroot support. 
  A special conference planned for this weekend was postponed 
in light of the January 24 parliamentary sitting, where 
amendments to the interim constitution could be approved. 
  IFP elections campaign political director Peter Miller said 
a 
special conference to decide on whether or not to contest 
elections would depend on the outcome of ongoing discussions on 
the interim constitution. "The special conference is the 
ultimate policy decision-making body of the party. If it is 
necessary to meet it will. Obviously the need for it to meet 
will be influenced by what happens in the coming weeks." 
  IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said the special 
conference might even be held after the January 24 parliamentary 
sitting, once "we know what the constitution ultimately 
contains".

<F P=106> [Phone-in interview with Reformed National Party leader Jaap </F>
Marais, chaired by SABC presenter Eon de Vos on the "Good 
Morning South Africa" program, italicized passages in English -- 
live] 
  [Text] [De Vos] Mr. Jaap Marais, good morning and welcome 
to Good Morning South Africa. We are holding discussions with 
several people across the political spectrum in South Africa and 
we are giving our viewers the opportunity of phoning in to air 
their views and maybe to ask a question. We have a first caller 
already and we have not even given a number yet. We will give 
it to you soon. If we talk about the HNP [Reformed National 
Party] -- we saw excerpts of your discussion in our 
advertisement, etcetera -- you put your views across very 
clearly, without any hidden messages, and you regard the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] as an undemocratic body 
which has no jurisdiction over you and your party, but at the 
same time you tell the government that there must be a white 
election. Would you then regard this as democratic if a large 
percentage of South Africans is excluded from such an election? 
  [Marais] Look, the government was voted into power by the 
white electorate. These are the people who gave the government 
a mandate. So if it wants to continue then it should get a 
mandate from those people, not from others. This is in 
accordance with the present constitution. It should act 
according to the terms of the current constitution and it does 
not have any mandate for what it is doing. In 1989 the 
government did not tell voters that it was going to embark on 
handing power over to an ANC [African National Congress] 
government. At that time it said white schools would remain 
white, the white residential areas would remain white. So it is 
not just acting without a mandate, it is also acting directly in 
contravention of the mandate it had asked for. For this reason 
it should come back to the white electorate. 
  [De Vos] Before it continues with the Transitional Executive 
Council? 
  [Marais] Yes. 
  [De Vos] Now what would the situation be like then -- you 
talk about a lost war, you talk about conflict -- is it HNP 
policy that if the HNP is not accommodated, or if people 
supporting your policy are not accommodated, then there will be 
conflict? 
  [Marais] Well, look the current negotiations are peace 
negotiations. The ANC was involved in a war against South 
Africa and the National Party [NP] government is making peace 
with the ANC. If these peace talks lead to the white man in 
South Africa becoming subjected to a communist government, then 
the future of the white man will be much worse than it would be 
if they instead stood up and prevented communist government from 
ruling them. For this reason the only choices we will have are 
either, virtual suicide under a communist government, or 
fighting to protect our people. 
  [De Vos] Now you are set on this idea that negotiations are 
out of the question -- that we cannot negotiate, etcetera, 
etcetera, but at the same time you are part of the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front -- AVF] who are involved in 
negotiations. Now how do you explain that? 
  [Marais] You are mistaken when you say that we are part of 
the Volksfront. From the beginning we said that we will not 
participate because there are real differences in approach 
between the two organizations. We say that the first priority 
is for us to stop the De Klerk government. If we do not stop 
it, it will continue to systematically give away our rights, as 
it has, for example, been done at the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation]. The people in the National Front 
only want to negotiate. They do not want to wage an open 
struggle against the De Klerk government. This is the basic 
difference between us in our whole approach. 
  [De Vos] The interesting thing is that when you talk about 
us, then I take it you are talking about the HNP and not the 
whole right-wing movement, as such. Is it possible for the HNP 
to stop the government? Are your numbers sufficient? 
  [Marais] I have no doubt that if the government calls for a 
general election today, that it will be flattened. For this 
reason it did away with by-elections. It is the most 
undemocratic thing that can ever happen in a country and they 
did away with it for only one reason, because it knows that it 
will lose every by-election and this will be proof that it does 
not have a mandate for what it is doing, so we have no doubt 
that the government is more scared of a general election than 
the devil is of holy water. 
  [De Vos] You are talking now about a white general election? 
  [Marais] Yes, a white general election. That is the only 
valid ... 
  [De Vos, interrupting] But who will defeat it? It will not 
be the HNP. 
  [Marais] Well, it depends. If an election is held then the 
entire right-wing spectrum will obviously be consolidated to 
defeat the government. You do not need any other reason for 
consolidation than the following: the government must be 
defeated. This is how it was in '48 -- the Afrikaner Party, the 
Gryshemde [Gray Shirts], the New Order, and the National Party 
stood together to defeat Smuts. 
  [De Vos] But you are talking about the election which 
brought 
the government to power in '89, but there was a referendum since 
then which showed support for government policy with an 
overwhelming yes vote. 
  [Marais] Look, that question in the referendum only dealt 
with continuation of negotiations to bring about a new 
constitution, but there was no talk of drafting a constitution 
which would eventually lead to the handing over of power to a 
communist government. The ANC is a communistic front. You must 
remember that the National Party always said that it supports 
power sharing. Mr. de Klerk himself said in 1977 that power 
sharing in a federation is a blueprint for the destruction of 
the white man. Now, no one can tell me that any government 
would get a mandate from a nation, for a blueprint for that 
nation's destruction. So that referendum is the biggest 
political gimmick ever seen in South Africa. The results were 
so influenced by intimidation and false promises that it has no 
validity whatsoever. 
  You speak about an election. You say it would be an 
opportunity to defeat the government. Well, there will be an 
election on 27 April; that's a foregone conclusion. Why don't 
you take part in it, and get to put your views across? 
  [Marais] Look, I don't believe it is a foregone conclusion 
that that election will take place. If the black homelands -- 
Zululand, Bophuthatswana, Ciskei -- as well as the right-wing 
opposition refuse to take part in that election, it would have 
no legitimacy. We say that election is a complete distortion of 
democracy. Not only is it a means of denying the Afrikaner his 
rightful political power, but millions of blacks with no 
understanding of democracy and democratic methods are being 
saddled with a responsiblity for which they are not prepared. 
The holding of a one man, one vote election has only one goal, 
and that is to break the Afrikaner's political power in South 
Africa. We are not prepared to give it any validity. 
  [De Vos] We had our first caller earlier. I'm not sure 
whether the person is still holding on...Yes, it seems the 
caller has been holding on patiently while we were talking. Our 
first caller is ready. Good morning. Who's calling? 
  [Worrall]Good morning, Eon. This is Brenda Worrall 
calling from Sandown. 
  [De Vos]Brenda, good morning. Yes, go ahead, 
please. 
  [Worrall]Yes, now I do not know when your rude 
awakening is going to come, Jaap Marais... 
  [De Vos, interrupting]Can we just ask, before we go on, 
can we just jack up the volume for Mr. Marais, please. He can't 
hear the phone caller properly. We'll turn on the 
loudspeakers here in the studio as well. Please, Brenda, 
can you go ahead now? 
  [Worrall]Yes. Now, what I was saying is I do not know 
when your rude awakening will come, Jaap Marais. We are black 
people. We are South Africans. We were and still are oppressed, 
and our liberation has absolutely nothing to do with the NP 
giving in to the demands of the ANC. Black people can liberate 
themselves and will do so, because they have and still continue 
to fight for their liberation. Your pro-apartheid and 
anti-black attitude -- however well you might disguise and 
justify that -- is only self-destructive unto yourselves. 
Please just face up to the reality. We are here to stay; a 
monster of a nightmare, maybe, but a reality to be dealt with. 
And, finally, I think you are the last person who can have 
anything to say about democracy, because people in South Africa 
know absolutely nothing about what democracy is. Thank you very 
much. 
  [De Vos]Thank you, Brenda. 
  [Marais] The volume was very loud, and I could not hear 
everything. [as heard] Could you just tell me briefly what it 
was all about? 
  [De Vos] Yes. To sum it up, she said we cannot wish away the 
black majority. It is a fact we have to live with, that blacks 
would achieve their liberation on their own, it had nothing to 
do with party politics. That's about it -- we must face up to 
the reality. 
  [Marais]We must realize that by just saying black 
majority is not stating the real position. There are various 
black nations in South Africa, and they differ among themselves 
just as much as whites and black in South Africa might differ. 
You must realize that between the Zulus and the Xhosas there 
has been war since before Jan van Riebeeck came to South Africa. 
There are the two Xhosa nations in Ciskei and Transkei; they 
have been at each other's throats for all these years. So there 
isn't just a simple black majority. There are various black 
nations in South Africa who are all entitled to govern 
themselves, and not to be governed by an organization such as 
the ANC, whic is Xhosa-dominated. So I think we have no problem 
in saying that the blacks have a legitimate claim to govern 
themselves, but not at the cost of the whites in South Africa. 
The whites have been the kingpin in the development of South 
Africa, and in creating stability, and even in stopping the 
tribal wars between blacks in South Africa. So it's absolutely 
foolish to think that you can switch South Africa to a black 
majority government and think that progress and peace and 
prosperity will continue. The whole of Africa has been a lesson 
to us that this is just not possible. 
  [De Vos] Following on the question she asked, is it not true 
that one could argue that if you use the rest of Africa as an 
example, where you say the whites were the axle around which 
everything turned, all the development, and so on...Can we not 
argue that that may be so, but that the whites were the axle at 
the cost of the greater group, the nonwhites, if you wish, or 
the blacks who, given the same opportunities, could also have 
been part of that axle? 
  [Marais] Well, you know, I could show you many articles 
where blacks in Africa are now saying:Bring back the white 
manbecause they were much better off when whites ruled. It 
is true that blacks perhaps suffered injustices, but no system 
can ever guarantee absolute justice to all. There are certain 
things which have to be done, which may be detrimental to 
certain people, but which are beneficial to the general welfare 
of society, and I do not think we have any doubt that the blacks 
in South Africa are the best organized in all Africa, simply 
because the whites were here. 
  [De Vos] Our next caller is on the line. You surname is Van 
Eeden, I believe? 
  [Van Eeden] Yes, Mike van Eeden. 
  [De Vos] Mike, good morning, and go ahead. 
  [Van Eeden] Mr. Marais, I'm not sure whether I understand 
you 
correctly, but it seems you are not prepared to live under a 
black government, yet we as blacks have had to live for years 
under a black [as heard] government. Why were we expected to do 
it? Why can't you, the whites, now also do the same? 
  [De Vos] The question says it seems you are not prepared to 
live under a black government, yet blacks have had to live under 
a white government all these years. Why not? 
  [Marais] Look, our point of view is that the whole policy of 
separate development was to enable black people or black nations 
to govern themselves, and not be governed by whites. That is 
the basic philosophy of nationalism. So it is not true to say 
that we believe it is right for blacks to live under whites, and 
not vice versa. That is not the case at all. 
  [De Vos] The next caller is on the line. I did not catch the 
name. Good morning to you. Who's calling? Could you repeat 
your name? 
  [Unidentified caller] I am 12 years old. I want to say to 
Mr. Jaap Marais, thank you very, very much for being such a good 
person to the whole of South Africa. We appreciate it very 
much, and I just know that the blacks will never defeat us. 
  [De Vos] Could you give your name again? 
  [Zeelie] Madeline Zeelie, from Bloemfontein. 
  [Marais] What did she say? 
  [De Vos] She said thank you very much. She said blacks will 
not defeat them. 
  [Marais] Well, thank you very much. 
  [De Vos]Have we got our next caller yet? I don't think 
so.If we look at the HNP, its formation, policy, you are 
actually what one might call the curator of the Verwoerd policy. 
But looking at the last election, and the votes that the HNP won 
at the polls, it would seem that your support is growing 
smaller. What would you say the future holds for the HNP? Is 
there a future? 
  [Marais] Look, in the 1981 election the HNP won 33 percent 
of 
the votes in Transvaal, where we stood against the NP. In mamy 
constituencies we got over 40 percent of the votes. Then the 
Conservative Party [CP] people realized that if they remained in 
the NP, they would be defeated by the HNP in the next election. 
So they broke away with a group of members of Parliament, and 
that gave the impression that they would provide an easier way 
of defeating the NP. It has now been found that the CP was not 
in a position to do so. But it affected the HNP detrimentally. 
The HNP has been in existence for 25 years, and we have never 
held a constituency, except for a short while. But we have 
never changed our policy. That is unique in our history. It 
only goes to show the indestructiliby of the foundation on which 
we stand. We stand on the same principles on which the NP of 
Hertzog, Malan, Strydom, and Verwoerd stood, and which form the 
foundation on which all the development in South Africa took 
place -- the constitutional development, the economic 
development, the cultural development. In politics, as in daily 
life, one has ups and downs. We are quite prepared to accept 
what is happening now. But we have no doubt that the HNP stance 
is correct, and will be proven to be correct. 
  [De Vos] Our next caller is on the line. Good morning. 
  [Engelbrecht] Good morning, Mr. Marais. My name is 
Engelbrecht of Melkbosstrand. Eon, thank you very much for the 
opportunity. Mr. Marais, I want to ask you this: The NP made 
many promises, both during the referendum and thereafter. We 
have been sobered by the fact that these promises have not been 
honored. One of the major promises Mr. de Klerk recently made 
was that he would reintroduce the death penalty, as a deterrent 
for the unbelievable level of violence prevailing in the country 
at present. Since then he has not carried out his promise. The 
violence is continuing, innocent children and adults are being 
murdered countrywide. I would just like to know how the HNP 
feels about this? 
  [De Vos] About the death penalty? 
  [Engelbrecht] Yes, the death penalty, but I would also like 
to know how Mr. de Klerk manages to get away with such lies? 
Why do they not tackle him about it in Parliament? 
  [De Vos] I think we have the gist of the question. I would 
think half of it should be directed at Mr. de Klerk, but 
nevertheless... 
  [Marais] Well, it's not only on the death penalty what we 
have been given false promises. One of the NP placards in the 
referendum read:/Want Jobs? Vote Yes.And as you know, 
of all this year's matriculants, only 4 percent will be able to 
get jobs. As for the death penalty, it was a popular thing to 
say at the time, and the NP jumped on the bandwagon. But now 
that it's time, as they say in English, to deliver the 
goods, because there will no longer be a white election, 
the government pretends it is not responsible. And that is the 
evil of this kind of thing -- by-elections have been 
discontinued, and the government can now simply ignore its own 
promises. But yes, we believe the death penalty must be 
reintroduced. 
  [De Vos] There we have it. The HNP says that the death 
penalty must be reintroduced. 
  [De Vos] We are ready for our next call. It seems that many 
are eager to speak about the HNP and its views this morning. 
Good morning. Who are we speaking to now? 
  [Du Pokoy] This is Freddie du Pokoy from Keimoes. 
  [De Vos] Freddie, good morning. From Keimoes? 
  [Du Pokoy] Yes, the capital of Upington. 
  [De Vos] The capital of Upington, Keimoes. Before we 
continue -- we have a sound problem...continue. 
  [Du Pokoy] Mr. Marais, I would like to ask you what you mean 
when you speak about communists, because in the past it was we 
who experienced the same thing. If someone did not agree with 
the government's policy, then he was a communist. Now that the 
ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], etcetera, are 
unbanned, I have met some of them -- I am not an ANC or PAC 
supporter but they are religious people. Where is this leading 
to? 
  [De Vos] The question is: What is a communist? 
  [Marais] Well, a communist is, of course, someone who 
follows 
the communist ideology and method. You must realize that 
communism is not just an ideology but it is a method of 
revolution through which existing orders are overthrown to be 
replaced by a communist order and the communist ideology is, of 
course, equal status to all people with no regard for gender, 
race, nationality, language, or anything. In the second place 
they believe that the state should control all means of 
production. Private property and private ownership must be 
wiped out. Communists are also basically against family life, 
saying that family life is a threat to a nation's productivity 
and for this reason family life also has to be eliminated. For 
this reason the education system, all social aspects of life 
must be geared toward promoting these goals. 
  [De Vos] It is interesting that you mention this because if 
one looks at what other parties, usually labeled as communists, 
are actually promoting then there are very few of these elements 
evident in their official policies. One could actually say, and 
I have heard this argument, that the National Party, for 
example, with their labor and homeland policies, etcetera -- the 
breaking up of families, etcetera -- have pursued those goals 
and have actually succeeded, and that they could be regarded as 
being on both sides of the spectrum. 
  [Marais] Well, look the National Party pretends that it is a 
party favoring the free-market system but it actually favors 
socialism, communism. It negates virtually every positive thing 
it does by embarking on a contradictory course of action -- the 
one man, one vote system, the eradication of apartheid. I can 
show you how the communists were on the brink of destroying 
apartheid in the fifties and sixties, in favor of one man, one 
vote. These are the basic things favored by communists to 
promote its ideology -- equal status, one man one vote, and the 
establishment of a communist government as it did in Rhodesia 
and Namibia. 
  [De Vos] Let us hear what our next caller has to say. This 
is George from Bophuthatswana. Hello, is that George? 
  [George] Yes, Mr. Jaap Marais, my name is George from 
Bophuthatswana. My grandfather is very old. My mother and 
father are also very old. There have always been whites 
suppressing the inhabitants of Africa, since 1652 as you well 
know, yet you still continue with your hatred, promoting this 
kaffir-boss relationship. Why can't you get rid of this and 
adopt a logical system used throughout the world, that of one 
man one vote, then you can serve under a newly elected 
government? Why are you so insistent? Look, your time has 
passed. 
  [De Vos] Thank you George. The basic point he raised is that 
he is a black man living in Bophuthatswana, and that the policy 
you favor is an old, worn-out policy. He asked why you do not 
move from this policy and follow the rest of the world where the 
one, man one vote policy has been a success. 
  [Marais] Look, the policy of one man, one vote -- it has 
been 
proven all over Africa that it led to a single one man, one vote 
election, and thereafter a one-party state emerged, or 
dictatorship. We have had one violent coup after another. 
Government in Africa is now a continuous process of revolution 
and the overthrow of governments. It has brought nothing but 
misery. Do you realize that Africa's contribution to the world 
economy last year was less than 1 percent? Africa has become a 
continent which exports nothing. It lives on credit as a result 
of the political systems which have brought economic misery. 
Remember that, during Dr. Verwoerd's time, when we had 
apartheid in this country, the growth rate was 7 percent per 
annum, inflation was 3 percent, and the prime lending rate was 
3.5 percent. The RAND DAILY MAIL said:The nation is 
suffering from a surfeit of prosperity. And what is the 
situation today? We have a negative growth rate, inflation has 
come down slightly to under 10 percent, but for years it was 
almost 20 percent. Interest rates have caused havoc to our 
economy. So you see, these are the practical consequences of 
policy. 
  [De Vos] Our next caller is Johnny Boardman of Wesselsbron. 
Good morning. 
  [Boardman] Good morning, Eon. I would just like to thank you 
all there at the studio for the manner in which you handle these 
discussions. We all appreciate it. To Mr. Marais: All these 
years I have followed your career and your statements, and I do 
appreciate what you are doing for the whites in South Africa. 
Over the years we have come to regard you as the prophet of the 
right wing. All the predictions you have made have proven to 
be correct. So this morning I would like to ask you to predict, 
here on the television, to the people of South Africa what lies 
ahead for us on the path that the De Klerk government is 
following? Maybe it will open people's eyes. 
  [Marais] Well, should the process which the government and 
the ANC are busy with go acccording to schedule right up to the 
end, there will be no order. It is impossible to accommodate 
the diverse population groups in this country under the roof of 
a single parliament. Parliamentary democracy has a limited 
tolerance for religious and racial differences. The result will 
be that the strongest group will seize power and oppress the 
other groups with force. That will lead to revolt, as in the 
rest of Africa. There is no way this process will succeed. The 
only way to ensure order is for Mr. de Klerk to have the courage 
to go back to the electorate and seek a mandate for what he is 
doing; and he will be defeated in a peaceful, orderly, 
constitutional manner. Then we can begin anew to restore order 
here -- not to draw up a new constitution, but to restore law 
and order, even if it has to go hand in hand with emergency 
regulations. But it would restore economic justice and put a 
stop to foreign interference in South Africa's affairs, so that 
this country can once again govern itself. Those are the three 
prerequisites for restoring an acceptable way of life here. 
  [De Vos] I think that is a good point for us to end on. 
Thanks to our viewers for your participation, and thank you, 
Mr. Marais.

  [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has again denied 
that it's responsible for last week's Heidelberg Tavern attack. 
At a Cape Town news conference today PAC negotiator Patricia de 
Lille said the organization has consistently condemned all acts 
of violence and is busy negotiating a comprehensive mutual 
cessation of hostilities with the government. She says the 
PAC's armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], has 
declared a moratorium on its armed struggle while talks on 
ending hostilities are underway. De Lille says follow-up 
discussions between the PAC and the government, and APLA and the 
SADF [South African Defense Force], are to be held within the 
next two weeks. 
  The PAC also strongly condemned the detention of two of its 
senior officials in connection with the Heidelberg attack. 
Michael Siyolo and Theo Mabusela were detained yesterday for 
questioning. Both men are being held under Section 29 of the 
Internal Security Act.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 5 SAPA -- Police investigations into 
the Heidelberg tavern attack indicated the attack could have 
been planned and executed from Transkei, Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel announced on Monday. 
  Mr Kriel said in a statement there had been a "major 
breakthrough" in the police investigation and the matter should 
now be taken up by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) "as 
a matter of urgency". 
  "Investigations have established a direct link between the 
perpertrators of the Heidelberg tavern atrocity and the 
territory of the Transkei. Furthermore, these investigations 
have also established that the Heidelberg tavern and other 
attacks could indeed have been planned and executed from the 
Transkei," Mr Kriel said. 
  The minister said ballistic tests had confirnmed that the 
weapons used in the Heidelberg attack and the weapons used in 
the St James Church massacre were identical. Gunmen burst into 
the tavern last Thursday night, killing three women and a man. 
  In the St James Church attack early last year, armed 
attackers killed 12 people, including several Russian sailors. 
  Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa has said he 
is 
prepared to hand over suspected attackers if the South African 
authorities can identify them. 
  Mr Kriel said on Wednesday: "Investigations have reached the 
stage where a joint investigation between the South African 
Police [SAP] and Transkei Police be considered a top priority. 
This would include the formation of a joint SAP/Transkei Police 
investigation team as rapidly as possible and the SA Police is 
ready to implement this." 
  South Africa last year sent soldiers into Transkei to pursue 
suspects in several attacks in South Africa. The soldiers 
attacked a home of a Pan-Africanist Congress member, killing 
four youths. The incident sparked a political and diplomatic row 
in which South Africa's ambassador to the homeland was expelled. 
  In his statement on Wednesday, Mr Kriel said: "Intensive 
investigations have resulted in a major breakthrough by the SA 
Police which now makes it essential that this matter be taken up 
as a matter of urgency by the Transitional Executive Council. 
It is a matter of extreme urgency that the TEC...Give advice on 
how to deal with the problem of dealing with suspects who take 
refuge in independent states. Speedy action is vital if the 
perpertrators are to be brought to justice without delay. It 
would be obstructive for the Transkei to insist on adhering 
strictly to a rigid and formal process of extradition in these 
areas."

<F P=106> [Report by Abbey Makoe] </F>
  [Text] Three alleged MK [Spear of the Nation, ANC military 
wing] commanders were shot and burnt to death by their 
colleagues serving in self-defence units [SDU] in Katlehong on 
Sunday in what is believed to be an ongoing "war" between the 
two groups, residents said. The three, all MK commanders based 
in Ncala Section, were executed while visiting the family of 
slain "Commander Boja," whose body was found at the mortuary 
earlier on the same day, witnesses said. Boja had disappeared 
on New Year's Eve. The last time he was seen was in the company 
of the three "commanders," a neighbour said. 
  A resident, who was part of a group that marched on the 
SDU's 
office in Mavimbela Section yesterday to protest against the 
clashes, was shot dead. Police confirmed the incident. Police 
said yesterday the death toll in Katlehong since New Year's Day 
stood at 16. Residents said hostilities between the SDUs and 
foreign-trained MK members based in Mavimbela and Ncala sections 
peaked on Sunday afternoon. The two sides, despite having 
fought heavily side by side in their "war" with members of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party, reportedly converged on their boundary -- 
Motaung Street -- and fired at each other. "They fought from 
11AM until 6PM, when members of the Internal Stability Unit came 
with reinforcements," a witness said. 
  Concerned residents spoke of kangaroo courts, in which 
suspects were tried and sentenced, even in their absence. Boja 
is alleged to have been killed by fellow commanders after he 
called for self-discipline. Most residents were concerned that 
the "war" was largely seen as ANC [African National Congress] 
against ANC in that the SDUs in both sections were run by MK 
commanders. But MK PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
regional chief of staff Mr. Viva Mkhonto yesterday said claims 
of MK soldiers leading the SDUs were not true. 
  He said while MK members were part of the communities, they 
did not necessarily control the controversial township 
neighbourhood watch groups. Senior MK officers had by yesterday 
not gone to investigate the claims, which he said he knew about 
only from rumour. "We cannot act on information that is not 
verified by our commanders," Mkhonto said.

  [Text] Self-defense units aligned to the ANC [African 
National Congress] are out of control and virtually at war with 
one another in troubled townships east of Johannesburg. The 
African National Congress, admitting some self-defense units are 
out of control, says it's trying to reestablish its authority 
over them. Sources close to the ANC say at least three 
self-defense units are out of control in townships east of 
Johannesburg, among the most violent in South Africa. The 
self-defense units are informal armed groups which live in and 
are responsible for the security of local communities.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 4 SAPA -- Police reacted with 
surprise on Tuesday to reports that African National Congress 
[ANC] members had been killing each other on the East Rand. 
Morning newspapers alleged three Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of 
the Nation; ANC military wing] commanders were shot and burnt to 
death by members of the ANC's self-defence unit [SDU] in 
Katlehong on Sunday in what was claimed to be an ongoing "war" 
between the two groups. 
  The reports claimed members of the police's internal 
stability division [ISD] broke up the fighting, which continued 
from 11 AM to 6 PM. However, East Rand police spokesman Lt Deon 
Peens said no such deaths had been reported from the area on 
Sunday. Furthermore, the ISD was not called out and detectives 
at local police stations knew nothing about the fighting, Lt 
Peens said. 
  Law and Order Ministry spokesman Capt Craig Kotze said it 
was 
worrying that "out-of-control" ANC self-defence units, 
especially on the volatile East Rand, had once again been 
exposed as the root cause of political violence. "It is the 
height of hypocrisy for the ANC to blame the SAP [South African 
Police] for the violence when killer ANC SDU's are not only 
deeply implicated in murdering policemen and eliminating 
political opponents, but are involved in bloody internal 
feuding," Capt Kotze said. He urged the ANC to co- operate with 
police to bring the perpetrators of SDU crimes to justice.

Mozambique. The South African charge d'affaires in Mozambique, 
Mr. (John Sund), has also been in contact with the Mozambican

the Namaacha Border post between Swaziland and Mozambique where 
motorists have been allegedly harassed by members of the 
Mozambican police force and forced to pay bribes. A South

<F P=106> [Article by Willem Pretorius: "People Want To Vote To Obtain </F>
Peace in South Africa; Most Fear Political Violence"] 
  [Text] "To bring peace to South Africa" is the most 
important reason that people are going to vote on 27 April of 
the coming year. This has just been established by an 
authoritative opinion poll. More than nine out of 10 people (92 
percent) stated that this is why they are going to vote. The 
competition among the various parties is still wide open, 
however, because more than a third of the voters (33 percent) 
have still not decided who is going to get their ballots. This 
poll did not include partisan political questions--in contrast 
to two others that show that the African National Congress (ANC) 
is going to win by a wide margin. (Report below) 
  The poll, which was conducted by three American 
institutions--the International Republican Institute, the 
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and the 
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies--shows that most 
South Africans fear political violence and crime. But the 
enormous gulf that exists between the various population groups 
is also evident from the survey, which consisted of a total of 
2,352 interviews conducted throughout the country between 19 
August and 26 September. Of these, 1,250 were conducted with 
blacks, 301 with whites, 450 with coloreds, and 351 with 
Indians. The homelands, self-governing regions, and rural areas 
were included. Some of the results of the poll that was made 
public this weekend include: 

  -  A total of 75 percent of the respondents said that 
right-wing extremists are going to unleash a war in the 
country; 
  -  Most South Africans are of the opinion that their lives 
are going to improve after the election. Only 8 percent of 
whites share this opinion as opposed to 73 percent of 
blacks; 
  -  Most of the people who are hopeful about the future are 
less well-off and a large majority of those who are under 35 
years of age (59 percent). Less than half of the older people 
are optimistic; 
  -  There are great differences between whites and 
blacks in regard to 13 questions put to them. Of the 13 
questions, the two groups agree on only one issue: that South 
Africa's foreign trade is going to improve. Most blacks believe 
that eight of the 13 problems will get better after the 
election, as opposed to whites, who believe that the situation 
in 12 of the 13 cases is going to get worse; 
  -  A full 80 
percent--primarily blacks and whites--say they will "very 
probably" vote, as opposed to Indians and coloreds, who are not 
as eager; 
  -  The greatest concern is over political violence, 
crime, and the economy. About one-third of the respondents said 
that political violence is sometimes justified; 
  -  Men and women 
differ a great deal on this issue, however. Some 72 percent of 
women say there is never a justification for political violence 
in contrast to 63 percent of men. For the most part, it is the 
younger men who feel this way. There are significant differences 
among blacks. Some 53 percent of Xhosas said that violence is 
sometimes necessary, as opposed to only 18 percent of Zulus; 
  -  Black people are hopeful about the election in contrast to 
the 
feelings of whites that can be summed up as "anxious." Coloreds 
are hopeful for the most part as well, while Indians' feelings 
can best be summed up as "perplexed." 
  1 
  Question: How do see your life in the next few years? 
  Responses: Overall: Better 61%; worse 18%; 
same 17% 
  Blacks: Better 73%; worse 10%; same 13% 
  Whites: Better 29%; worse 47%; same 21% 
  Coloreds: Better 57%; worse 16 %; same 23%

  [Text] The results of two separate surveys examining voter 
preferences for next year's election show that the African 
National Congress (ANC) is going to win by a wide margin--with 
the National Party (NP) coming in second. A poll conducted by 
Integrated Market Research (IMR) for THE SUNDAY TIMES found that 
the ANC can garner up to 60 percent support in contrast to a 
meager 13 percent for the NP--with the Freedom Alliance coming 
in right behind at 11.5 percent. 
  Mr. Donald Simpson, an independent election analyst, 
projected for RAPPORT that the ANC could get 57.10 percent of 
the votes, the NP 15.51 percent, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) 
9.22 percent, the CP [Conservative Party] 4.10 percent, the DP 
[Democratic Party] 4.00 percent, the Afrikaner People's Union 
(AVU) 0.30 percent, the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] 5.23 
percent, and regional parties 3.30 percent. 
  According to the IMR, support among black people for the NP 
has decreased drastically. Less than 2 percent of them will vote 
for the party, while support for it has declined to 40 percent 
among whites. A large segment of the colored and Indian 
community, where the NP is campaigning heavily, is still 
uncertain as to how it will vote, however. According to one of 
the polls, the ANC will not achieve the two-thirds majority 
necessary to change the constitution. The predictions are 
causing concern to the NP and Inkatha even though there are six 
months to go to the election. According to constitutional 
provisions, they will only be junior partners in the government. 
The rest of the parties are doing hopelessly poorly. 
  In accordance with constitutional provisions, the ANC, with 
its predicted support, will get 19 posts in the 30-member 
cabinet. It will also be able to designate a president and vice 
president and will thus have a two-thirds majority in the 
cabinet. Accordingly, President F.W. de Klerk will be the second 
vice president with an additional four posts for the NP. The 
Freedom Alliance will also be able to occupy four posts. 
  The survey was conducted among 2,200 people nationwide and 
the margin of error is 4 percent. According to Mr. Simpson, the 
parties could end up with the following seats in the National 
Assembly: ANC 229, NP 66, IFP 37, CP 17, DP 16, AVU 1, regional 
parties 13, and the PAC 21. He also predicts that the Northern 
and Western Cape are the only two regions where the NP could win 
easily.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Action Needed on Peacekeeping Force -- Johannesburg THE STAR 
in English on 5 January in a page 10 editorial notes that the 27 
April election "is supposedly to be policed by a body that does 
not yet exist, the National Peacekeeping Force. Unless work 
takes place at the speed of greased lightening, we could have a 
problem." "It is now much too late to ask the United Nations 
for an international contingent. The National Peacekeeping 
Force is the most vital single bridgehead on the next leg of the 
forward path. Get moving." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Too Late for Peacekeeping Force Before April Election -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 5 January in a page 6 
editorial says there is "a strong case" for a national 
peacekeeping force, but the project "has been left so late, and 
political problems are so complex, that there seems little 
chance it would be ready in time to accomplish anything. It 
would be better to scrap the idea than thrust responsibility on 
to an inadequate, poorly trained force." BUSINESS DAY advises 
the Transitional Executive Council, TEC to "lower its sights, 
form a small, symbolic squad for special duties, and concentrate 
its efforts on restructuring the security forces as a whole." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  TEC Must `Be Seen To Have Teeth' -- The TEC will have to 
"define its role very clearly if the institution is to gain 
credibility," remarks Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 5 
January in a page 6 editorial. "It will also have to be seen to 
have teeth to earn respect." The TEC gas asked the government 
to deploy the South African Police in northern Natal, including 
parts of kwaZulu, but the government says "it is still studying 
the request." The TEC has ordered the kwaZulu Commissioner of 
Police to supply it with information about alleged hit squads in 
his force. The kwaZulu chief minister "has stopped him from 
co-operating with the TEC." Now the African National Congress, 
ANC, "seems set to ask it to intervene in the purchase by 
kwaZulu of a luxury R[rand]33 million jet. The TEC will have to 
strenuously avoid being seen as a tool of the ANC in its fight 
against the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. It has to work on 
projecting an image of impartiality." 
<H6>  ILANGA </H6>
  New South Africa Can Only Hope for 'Gradual Change' -- 
Durban 
ILANGA in Zulu for 30 December to 1 January in a page 4 
editorial says: "The hot topic these days among many people is 
that 1994 heralds a new South Africa. We believe that the black 
nation can hardly wait to leave apartheid behind. Let us, 
however, give a word of caution! To some, this new South Africa 
spells heaven on earth. You hear them say: Come oh new South 
Africa and let us eat well, live in new houses. Even among 
school pupils you hear things like: Even if we fail come year's 
end, it will not mean much, because in the new South Africa it 
will be pass one pass all. No such thing will happen. Those 
who imagine that come 27 April this country will be a land 
flowing with honey are to be pitied as they live in a fool's 
paradise. All that can be hoped for is that if all goes well 
politically, things will gradually change for the better, but 
not in the blinking of an eye." "The new South Africa will 
yield good and enjoyable results only if we all work with 
determination to make it so in all aspects of life, and not just 
in the political field."

  [Text] We have just heard that alleged UNITA members 
attacked the city of Malanje this morning, which prevented a 
plane carrying three US congressmen from landing. The plane 
turned back to Luanda. This report comes to us from the LUSA 
news agency [Portuguese]. According to Angolan national radio, 
the city of Malanje has been under an intense attack by UNITA 
since the early hours of the morning. A woman was killed in the 
Ritondo district, 2 km from the center of the city, and 3 km 
from the airport.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Three U.S. congressmen failed to 
land in Malanje today because of heavy shelling allegedly by 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. 
[passage omitted]. The UNITA delegation in Lisbon has denied 
the attack on Malanje. Carlos Fontoura [UNITA representative in 
Lisbon] says it has all been fabricated. 
  [Begin recording] [Fontoura] I have to deny categorically 
any 
UNITA action to that effect. [passage omitted]. It is obvious 
that the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] is 
beginning to show a blatant and evident lack of imagination. A 
few days ago -- when the visit by the Americans, the U.S. 
congressmen, was being planned -- the day before they invented 
and publicized a UNITA attack against Malongo, which as you know 
not even the American company confirmed. Now, the day the 
Congressmen were due to arrive the MPLA invents all this 
guerrilla activity, which is no way part of UNITA's objectives.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The resumption of the Angolan peace talks due in 
Lusaka this afternoon has been overshadowed by inauspicious 
events back in Angola. Four American congressmen were flying to 
the city of Malanje on a fact-finding visit. They never made it. 
The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
rebels launched a bombardment of the city and the plane carrying 
the Americans turned back. So did the United Nations plane in 
which our correspondent Chris Simpson was travelling. He is now 
back in Luanda and sent this report. 
  Flagelamentos [shellings] is what we heard over the radio as 
our plane was 30 minutes away from Malanje. It is a word you 
hear a lot in Angola. Loosely translated, it means attacks or 
bombardments. Confirmation rapidly came that UNITA had indeed 
been shelling Malanje and the four U.S. congressmen and [words 
indistinct] in the other plane had been turned back for security 
reasons. Malanje was, at least temporarily, off limits, just as 
it was for weeks on end last year when the city starved for lack 
of food aid. At least it is never dull here, an aid official 
[word indistinct] observed, amid a series of urgent radio 
messages. 
  The World Food Program, which is currently sending eight 
planes a day to Malanje, put its Malange operations on a standby 
and the congressmen's itinerary was rapidly rearranged. Angolan 
national radio later claimed that UNITA had been shelling 
persistently since the early hours of the morning, causing at 
least (?two deaths). 
  Why now, why today, of all days, when the peace talks are 
back on? These were the questions everyone was asking. It 
remains to be seen whether UNITA will have any answers to offer. 
Jonas Savimbi's movement might argue, however, that all 
publicity is good publicity and that having been left off the 
visiting congressmen's itinerary, it was only fair that UNITA be 
allowed to spoil the rest of the program.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura 
is expected to meet UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in 
New York today. Indications are that the Angolan foreign 
minister will present Luanda's latest national reconciliation 
proposals to Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN 
special representative in Angola, confirmed today that the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] will resume their peace talks in Lusaka tomorrow, 
after the festive season recess. The UN special representative 
announced this to the media shortly before leaving Luanda for 
quick visits to Gabon and Zaire. He will be briefing the heads 
of state of those two countries on the reality of the situation 
at the Angolan peace talks. It is also noteworthy that a team of 
U.S. senators is to arrive in Luanda today, after postponing 
their scheduled visit late last year. Gustavo Costa, our 
correspondent in Angola, provides some details concerning the 
national reconciliation counterproposal that Foreign Minister 
Venancio de Moura will be presenting to the UN secretary general 
today. 
  [Begin Costa recording] According to a source close to the 
Angolan peace talks, the new national reconciliation 
counterproposal includes three ministerial portfolios for UNITA 
to be indicated by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 
two to be suggested by Prime Minister Marcolino Moco, and at 
least three embassies to be led by UNITA, among other new 
developments. Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de 
Moura is expected to deliver that proposal to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Burtrus-Ghali in New York today. 
  Some observers feel that Venancio de Moura's call on the UN 
secretary general one day before the talks are due to resume in 
Lusaka shows that the Luanda government intends to use Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's personal influence with UNITA leader Jonas 
Savimbi so the latter will accept the government's 
counterproposal and will agree to the setting of a date to sign 
the cease-fire accord. 
  Diplomatic sources say that Luanda's response suggests an 
attempt to meet UNITA's initial proposal halfway. It is already 
known, however, that UNITA will not be given some key ministries 
it has demanded. Luanda is reported to have shown inflexibility 
concerning the Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior 
Ministries, but it may be more open to UNITA holding ministerial 
portfolios linked to social and production sectors. Luanda is 
keeping open the possibility that UNITA will retain the Culture 
Ministry and it has replied that UNITA will only control three 
of the six embassies it has demanded. 
  Meanwhile, moves linked to the Angolan peace process are not 
taking place in New York alone. In fact, the seriousness of 
this country's situation is such that a team of U.S. congressmen 
[as heard] has come to Luanda to assess on the ground the 
complexity of a problem whose solution seems increasingly linked 
to a higher U.S. profile in a bid to reduce mistrust between the 
government and UNITA. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
received the U.S. team in Luanda this afternoon, but UNITA, 
through its Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel radio 
station, has already announced that it would like to see the 
team of U.S. congressmen in Huambo tomorrow to discuss troop 
demobilization and national reconstruction issues with UNITA 
leader Jonas Savimbi. 
  It appears, though, that such a visit is not on the agenda 
of 
the U.S. congressmen's stay in Angola. An official source has 
disclosed that, contrary to initial reports by sources in the 
Angolan Parliament, tomorrow the U.S. team will visit Malange 
rather than Bie [Cuito]. 
  UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the (?key 
figure) in the negotiation process, is one person who does not 
appear to be satisfied with half measures. Today, he stopped 
over in Libreville, the Gabonese capital, and Gbadolite, in 
Zaire. Upon his return from Sao Tome and Principe yesterday, UN 
Special Representative Blondin Beye said that military issues 
will not be up for discussion again when peace talks resume in 
the Zambian capital tomorrow. Diplomatic sources say that such 
issues will only be the subject of adjustments when the 
government and UNITA military leaders meet in Sao Tome on 10 
January to define practical measures conducive to the signing 
and effective implementation of the cease-fire accord. [end

  [Text] Beginning tomorrow, the attention of the Angolan 
people and the international community will be directed toward 
Lusaka, Zambia, where the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] will resume peace 
talks, under the UN mediation. However, it is particularly the 
Angolan people who wait with great expectations the debates in 
the Zambian capital, which are expected to end their suffering. 
  Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye, main mediator in the peace 
talks, has already visited Gabon and Gbadolite in Zaire and his 
whereabouts presently are not known. All the same, it is known 
that the peace talks will begin in Lusaka at 1600 hours 
tomorrow. Alioune Blondin Beye said military issues [words 
indistinct] discussed and agreed upon by the parties [words 
indistinct] only to assert views, since on 10 January, the 
military leadership from UNITA and the MPLA-PT will meet in Sao 
Tome and Principe. 
  In this second round of peace talks, the two warring parties 
will discuss the political package which, among other issues, 
includes the formation of the new national police, UNITA's 
participation in the government, the future role of the UN 
Angola Verification Mission, issues connected with [words 
indistinct], and national reconciliation.

  [Text] As scheduled, the peace talks between the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] will resume in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, today. 
The eyes and hearts of the peace- and freedom-hungry Angolan 
people, in particular, will be following developments in Lusaka 
with great interest. 
  UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye was still in 
Luanda this morning, after quick diplomatic visits to Gabon and 
Zaire to explain the complexities of the Lusaka peace talks to 
the heads of state of those two African nations. Later, Blondin 
Beye left for the Zambian capital, where, according to him, 
things are likely to start happening at 1400 GMT. This second 
round of talks will concentrate solely on political issues, 
notably the formation of a new national police force, national 
reconciliation, UNITA's participation in government, the future 
role of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2, and the setting of 
a date for the cease-fire accord to come into force. Military 
issues had already been discussed and agreed on after about 
three weeks of talks.

  [Text] The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, have restored control 
over the entire region around Malongo base in Cabinda Province, 
which UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] troops shelled on 1 January. 
  [Begin recording] [FAA spokesman Colonel Manuel Paiva] What 
happened in Malongo was that an unspecified number of enemy 
soldiers approached the Malongo oil complex under cover of 
darkness in an attempt to inflict economic losses on the 
petroleum company. The enemy fired a number of 81-mm mortar 
rounds from (Siela), near the Socoto valley. That is about 4 km 
from the Malongo oil complex. Fortunately, the five rounds that 
the enemy fired did not cause material or human losses. In 
response, our troops inflicted an unspecified number of 
casualties on the enemy, forcing it to withdraw in disarray. So 
that was what happened on 1 January 1994. 
  [Reporter] So, is the situation under control right now? 
  [Paiva] Yes. Our troops have taken the necessary 
precautions. One should point out that small groups are moving 
in the (Pande Vinte) and Sabantando regions. Our troops are 
ready to give an adequate response. [end recording]

  [Text] Official UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] sources connected with the General Staff 
of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] today 
strongly rejected reports going the rounds in Spain that UNITA 
supervised lethal equipment sent from that country to Angola. 
The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA- PT] provided the Riot Police with such equipment. A FALA 
officer, who was part of the Joint Political and Military 
Commission, said the Bicesse Accord is quite clear when it says 
that no country or government may supply lethal equipment to any 
of the signatories of the accord. 
  Yesterda, ABC, which is published in Madrid, reported that 
the Spanish opposition demanded explanations about the sale of 
weapons to the MPLA-PT when the Bicesse Accord was still in 
force. Felipe Gonzalez' government refused to comment, alleging 
that the equipment delivered to the MPLA was a state secret. 
  Meanwhile, ABC says the Spanish Government has confirmed its 
participation in training the MPLA's riot Police. Our FALA 
sources said Spain should be condemned by the UN Security 
Council for its involvement in the violation of the Bicesse 
Accord.

  [Text] Cabinda Provincial Governor Augusto da Silva Tomas 
has expressed satisfaction about the fact that separatist 
organizations in the province have chosen the path of dialogue, 
rather than the armed struggle, to solve problems linked to the 
future of the enclave. 
  [Begin Tomas recording] The efforts being made by the 
government, all men of good will -- notably those in the 
churches and international organizations represented here -- and 
the people of Cabinda Province at large, have finally allowed 
consensus to be sought on the basis of majority so that 
Cabinda's problems can be settled at the negotiating table, 
rather than by taking up arms. 
  To us, it has been a source of satisfaction and pride to 
learn that, finally, our brethren in the Renewed Front for the 
Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave, the Cabinda Democratic Front, 
the Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, the Movement of 
Resistance for the Total Independence of Cabinda [words 
indistinct] have decided to build a common front called the 
Cabinda Nationalist Forum, Fonac, that will seek to create 
favorable conditions for future talks with the government of the 
Republic of Angola. This is a patriotic stand. Taking into 
account the suffering of their people, they have decided to 
write yet another brilliant page in the history book of our 
heroic people of Cabinda, in line with our ancestors' teachings. 
We sincerely hope that this initiative will not be aborted, as 
has happened with so many other initiatives in our recent 
history. 
  We would also like to convey to our Cabinda brethren our 
wish 
that the negative influence of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola will not harm their interests. [end

Chakuamba, from stoning by members of the opposition United 
Democratic Front Party after he addressed a rally of the ruling 
Malawi Congress Party yesterday. Several residents of Bangwe, 
one of Blantyre's biggest townships with over 150,000 people, 
told newsmen that Mr. Chakuamba, who is secretary general of the 
Malawi Congress Party, was stoned after upsetting opposition 
supporters by calling the president of the United Democratic

  [Text] The minister of justice and attorney general has 
refused to receive a memorandum from the Malawi Democratic 
Party, MDP, which required the president to retire. In a press 
release issued today, the minister of justice and attorney 
general said he had refused to receive the memorandum because he 
thought the document was not only irresponsible but also 
undemocratic and unconstitutional. 
  The press release said it is the view of the minister of 
justice and attorney general that the president of this country 
can only be elected into office or removed from office by all 
the citizens who are eligible to vote through the ballot and not 
by the MDP alone, through what he called unorthodox means. The 
press release added that if the MDP wants the president to be 
removed from power it should go to the countryside and campaign 
for the forthcoming general elections so that it is voted into 
power through the ballot box. 
  The press release, therefore, advised the MDP not to deliver 
such documents to the attorney general who, it said, had no 
power whatsoever under the constitution or any of the country's 
laws to ask the president to retire. 
  Meanwhile, our reporter says police in Blantyre today 
stopped 
a march organized by the MDP to deliver the memorandum to the 
government (?through) the attorney general. Our reporter says 
the march, which had about 100 participants, and was led by the 
MDP secretary general Mr. Kondowe started at 1000 this morning 
from the clock tower in Blantyre. In the ensuing incident Mr. 
Kondowe and his driver were taken to the Southern Division 
Police headquarters. Latest reports say Mr. Kondowe and his 
driver have since been let free.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] President 
Afonso Dhlakama has once again accused General Domingos Fondo 
and government forces of trafficking in firearms with 
neighboring South Africa. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said 
the case is already known by President of the Republic Joaquim 
Chissano and that it involves a large quantity of weapons. The 
Renamo leader said this yesterday afternoon in Maringue, the 
general headquarters of his movement, at a news conference to 
mark the new year. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] I can give you an example of 
weapons being taken to South Africa with the knowledge of 
President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano. General Fondo has 
been involved in the sale of weapons to South Africa and these 
people then try to (?blame) Renamo. Large quantities of weapons 
are taken in trucks and sold to South Africa and everyone is 
aware of this [words indistinct]. 
  Frelimo has always acted in bad faith. Frelimo officials 
have always been warmongering and it was with the war that they 
[words indistinct]. It was with the war that they maintained 
and continue to maintain themselves in power. Many of them 
[words indistinct] that the war has ended. They know that they 
can lose elections [words indistinct]. I even believe that 
there are still many Marxists in Frelimo, who are not (?aware) 
that the war has ended. One of them is Marcelino dos Santos 
[Assembly of the Republic chairman]. For example, you must have 
heard recently [words indistinct] in the Assembly of the 
Republic [words indistinct]. We have in fact reached the 
conclusion that some of these people did not want the war to 
end. There is a recent example [words indistinct] in Nampula 
[words indistinct] and it was not just propaganda. We caught a 
police sergeant, who was hidden in a hall where [words 
indistinct]. He was there. Two of them were there with 
pistols. There was also the case of [words indistinct] he will 
try to hide but we know, we have proof, that he has a plan 
[words indistinct] in Maputo. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the Renamo leader expressed satisfaction with the 
political situation in the country and the steps made so far in 
implementing the General Peace Accord, despite the observed 
delays.

  [Text] In Maputo today, General Domingos Fondo, of the 
Mozambique Armed Forces, rejected accusations by Afonso 
Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, that 
he smuggles large quantities of weapons to neighboring South 
Africa. Speaking to the Mozambican and international media, 
Gen. Domingos Fondo made it very clear that he could not care 
less about Dhlakama's accusations. He added that Afonso 
Dhlakama must go to court, present his case, and prove his 
accusations or he will have to pay. 
  [Begin Fondo recording] As you know, our country has an 
institution that deals with accusations such as those. He 
should draw up a criminal complaint and deliver it directly to 
the correct institution so it can summon Gen. Fondo to answer 
those charges. He should bring the matter before the court 
rather than make those comments in public. A person who accuses 
another person of having committed a crime does not do so in the 
street but, rather, brings the case before the competent 
institution. I do not feel offended at this stage [words 
indistinct] must go directly to court and if there is no 
concrete evidence to back what he is saying, he will pay. When 
a person makes an accusation [words indistinct] has to pay. If 
you accuse someone of stealing, you go to court and say: he has 
stolen from me. In turn, the court will say: well, you must 
pay now. [end recording] 
  Asked about international media reports on his alleged 
involvement in arms trafficking, Gen. Domingos Fondo said he had 
nothing to say. He was also asked to comment on whether he has 
business interests in South Africa: 
  [Begin recording] [Fondo] I do not know whether you have 
come 
here as businessmen. If you are here to treat me as a 
businessman, then I must take off my uniform and then you must 
talk to me as you would to a businessman. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Fondo] If you are here to treat me as a businessman, then 
let us talk directly about what my company does. If I am here 
accused of (?smuggling) arms, then that is another matter 
altogether. You are here to talk to me as a member of 
parliament and a member of the Mozambique Liberation Front Party. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Fondo] [Words indistinct] (?weapons), if someone gets in 
touch with me, he does so in my capacity as general, to offer 
weapons at that particular time [words indistinct] (?and then it 
is over). [end recording]

  [Text] Jose de Castro, head of the Mozambique National

Chimoio that, despite a certain slowness in the confinement of 
Renamo troops, the work that has been done so far has been 
positive. 
  Speaking to the media in Chimoio, Jose de Castro said that 
the people who complain about Renamo's troop confinement 
slowness should rather consider the differences in the general 
conditions -- notably transportation -- enjoyed by Renamo and by 
the government forces. 
  The head of the Renamo Foreign Affairs Department also 
affirmed that he hopes 1994 will be the year that will (?prove) 
both sides share the desire to see true peace restored to the 
country.

buy food and clothing for soldiers in government and Mozambique 
National Resistance troop confinement centers. MEDIAFAX further 
reports that $1.2 million will be used to buy food and the

  Italy has provided this aid in the wake of UN Special 
Representative Aldo Ajello's call to the international community 
to provide logistical assistance to the troop confinement areas. 
  The Italian Government will also assist in the

of military training centers in Dondo, Sofala Province, and 
(Monguine) as well as Boane, in Maputo Province.

  [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission met in Maputo this 
afternoon. Radio Mozambique learned that 600 Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] soldiers abandoned two confinement centers 
in Sofala Province. Faustino Igrejas reports: 
  It is true that 600 Renamo men today abandoned their 
confinement centers in Chiramba and Magunde in Sofala Province, 
alleging logistical problems. The Cease-Fire Commission met in 
Maputo today and centered its discussions on the logistical 
problems facing the confinement centers. Major Eduardo 
Alexandre from the Cease-Fire Commission spoke to journalists 
after the meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Alexandre] We discussed mainly issues 
connected with food logistics in confinement centers. It has 
been observed that in certain confinement centers, Renamo troops 
are deserting. I refer to Magunde and Chiramba in particular. 
The meeting is therefore aimed at finding ways of halting these 
desertions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What was decided? 
  [Alexandre] It was decided that the government would support 
its troops during the confinement period, providing them fresh 
products. 
  [Reporter] Has Renamo already begun to withdraw from Dunda 
and Salamanga? 
  [Alexandre] As a matter of fact, we shall discuss this 
problem tomorrow, from the technical viewpoint. It is a 
situation connected with distance. Renamo feels that it should 
withdraw only 700 meters, while the (?government) feels that 
they should withdraw further. 
  [Reporter] Tomorrow's meeting is therefore aimed at 
discussing Renamo's withdrawal from Dunda and Salamanga? 
  [Alexandre] Tomorrow we shall hold the biggest tripartite 
meeting to discuss the area Renamo should withdraw to from the 
area it presently occupies. [end recording] 
  Radio Mozambique also asked Colonel (Sitela) from the UN 
Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] if he would confirm that 600 
Renamo men abandoned their confinement centers in Chiramba and 
Magunde. 
  [Begin recording] [(Sitela)] Yes. I can confirm that from 
the information we received. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it because of logistical 
problems? 
  [(Sitela)] I do not know. We [words indistinct] the problem 
to the Renamo representative [words indistinct]. It is possible 
that it is because of logistical problems. 
  [Reporter] It seems that the Unomoz had a responsibility, 
but 
the government says it has no responsibility? 
  [(Sitela)] Well, I feel that we were able to coordinate 
views 
during the Cease-Fire Commission meeting that we have just held. 
We defined the manner to provide logistical assistance. 
  [Reporter] What will be the manner? 
  [(Sitela)] The government will continue to supply fresh food 
to its own troops in their confinement areas, including other 
staples which are already being distributed to the two sides by 
Unomoz. With regard to Renamo, Unomoz will have the duty of 
supplying fresh food to Renamo personnel. Thus, the two sides 
will (?be able to receive) a more favorable (?food supply). 
Unomoz will be responsible for providing the transportation of 
food for Renamo personnel, while the government will in 
principle be responsible for providing transportation of food to 
its men. If the government needs assistance in the process, 
Unomoz will do all it can to help. [end recording] 
  An important thing is that the 600 men who abandoned their 
confinement areas in Chiramba and Magunde in Sofala Province 
today left without their weapons.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama has once again accused news media organs of 
being biased. Nogueira da Silva reports from Maringue, Renamo's 
general headquarters. 
  Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has admitted that the 
pacification process in the country will soon enter a difficult 
phase since most people in rural areas are illiterate. Afonso 
Dhlakama said it was necessary to educate the people about the 
meaning of democracy, [words indistinct] and how to vote, among 
other issues, connected with the electoral process. He said it 
is necessary to explain to the people that not voting for the 
Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] would not mean their 
death. Likewise, if people did not vote for Renamo it would not 
mean that they would be killed, the Renamo president stressed. 
He said the people are still afraid of Frelimo. 
  At a news conference he gave in Maringue yesterday to mark 
the New Year, the Renamo leader once again accused the news 
media organs in the country of being biased. 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] There is still no press freedom 
in the country. This is what I can say. I have always spoken 
about this issue and I continue to speak. For example, I am 
speaking here. If you return today and to do not report what I 
am saying, if you cut or just try to report bits and pieces of 
what I am saying, it means that you have no freedom. I shall 
therefore continue to speak about lack of press freedom. 
  We want to see the freedom of the press in Mozambique and 
you, as journalists, should correctly inform the people. The 
people do not want propaganda. They want to hear the truth. In 
my case, I want the people to hear what I am saying. You should 
not, therefore, be the ones to cut my words or choose what you 
think should be reported. You cannot say: Dhlakama's words were 
too strong. We cannot report them because Frelimo will not like 
it. Let us report what is not strong. 
  Although I continue to speak about lack of press freedom, I 
must also say that things are improving. We have to recognize 
that things are improving. All the same, I would like to see 
the press have greater freedom in Mozambique than is presently 
the case. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, do you believe there 
has been reconciliation in the country since the signing of the 
general peace accord? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, I can say that there has been. The 
situation is a little bit difficult. Let us recognize that 
Freelimo has ruled and continues to rule the country alone. It 
has not been easy for Frelimo to heed the message of 
reconciliation. We have been receiving complaints from our 
members who are maltreated. Some of them are expelled from 
work. Some of our members who are civil servants are expelled 
just because they visited Maringue. That is the case with you. 
You were dismissed from work because you came to Maringue. 
Today, you work for Renamo full time. There are other cases 
where our members were expelled, including teachers, (?typists). 
Others were expelled from companies, hospitals, and so on. We 
have already talked to the government about it and we think that 
we shall be able to defend the interests and rights of our 
members. [end recording]

  [Text] The new human rights group, Movement for National 
Redemption (Monare), has warned of a confrontation between 
various political forces here. The interim president of the 
organization, Mr. Patrick Msibi yesterday said: "In a research 
which was carried out by the organization from March 1993 to 
December of the same year, we were able to get hold of tangible 
evidence to the effect that a confrontation is looming in 
Swaziland." 
  He said the research also revealed that the forces concerned 
have since targeted some structures which they want to destroy. 
These include schools and bridges. He would not name the 
organizations, but mentioned that they are known. 
  He said the view of Monare is that to most Swazi people who 
are not satisfied with the current political situation whose 
foundations were laid by the Vusela [greetings) committees, the 
negotiation chapter for politics has ended. "Our feeling is 
that this confrontation could be avoided in the interest of the 
right to life, property, and economic stability." 
  He mentioned that most countries attain utmost respect for 
rights through the barrel of the gun. "We feel that Swaziland 
could be a good example by avoiding this confrontation 
peacefully," he said. 
  A comment from the police with regard to this claim was not 
available as senior officers were reported held in a meeting 
yesterday.

<F P=106> [By Regina Jere] </F>
  [Text] Lusaka, Jan 4 (AFP) -- Zambian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Vernon Mwaanga announced his resignation Tuesday 
following a barrage of press and public accusations linking him 
to drug trafficking. 
  Mwaanga's resignation also comes in the wake of 
international 
concern over corruption and drug dealing in the Zambian 
Government expressed by donors at a consultative group meeting 
in Paris last month. 
  "I want to inform the nation of my solemn decision to stand 
down as minister of foreign affairs with immediate effect," 
Mwaanga told a packed press conference at his office, adding 
that his decision was as a result of a relentless campaign 
fuelled by "people and entities with limitless malice." 
  "I am not involved in drug trafficking and I am not involved 
in corrupt practices or abuse of public office...but it is my 
duty to see to it that government position is not compromised," 
he said. 
  The minister said his decision to step down was aimed at 
giving the government a free hand to investigate fully and 
thouroughly the allegations levelled against him. "It is my 
perception that the government should have unfettered ability to 
investigate allegations of drug trafficking, corruption and 
misuse of public funds by public officers at whatever levels," 
Mwaanga said. 
  He became the fourth cabinet minister to voluntarily leave 
the two-year-old government of President Frederick Chiluba. 
  Since ushering in his cabinet after the 1991 multi-party 
elections, Chiluba has been under persistent pressure to act on 
alleged high level corruption and and drug trafficking in his 
government. 
  Local press reports and opposition figures have alleged that 
there are a number of ministers involved in the vice and accused 
Chiluba of failing to take action because they bankrolled his 
1991 presidential campaign. 
  Mwaanga, Community Development Minister Nakatindi Wina and 
her husband Sikota, who is deputy speaker of the National 
Assembly, were detained for months by former president Kenneth 
Kaunda for their alleged involvement in mandrax drug trafficking 
in 1985. The findings of a special tribunal appointed by Kaunda 
to investigate them have not been made public. 
  Finance Minister Ronald Penza told journalists after the 
Paris meeting that donors had withheld 96 million dollars of the 
required financial assistance of almost a billion dollars 
because of their concern about drug trafficking and corruption 
in the Zambian Government. He said the donors described Zambia 
as "the Columbia of Africa" and he called on Chiluba to take 
action before the next consultative group meeting in March. 
  Deputy Minister for Economic Planning Dean Mungomba, who 
accompanied Penza to Paris, has echoed the finance minister's 
views. "Our relations with our cooperating partners will be 
strained if serious steps are not taken before March.... We 
have dealt with serious problems like inflation and monetary 
control, I do not see why drug trafficking cannot be dealt 
with," Mungomba said. 
  Mwaanga said, however, that he will remain a committed 
member 
of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) although 
"the campaign against me has been orchestrated by colleagues in 
government who are themselves the very epitome of greed, who 
from their first day in government have used every opportunity 
to sustain their appetite for material possessions." He 
appealed to the other ministers accused of drug dealing to 
follow his example.

  [Text] President Chiluba says he has received a letter of 
resignation from Foreign Affairs Minister Mr. Vernon Mwaanga. 
The president's special assistance for press and public 
relations, Richard Sakala, said Mr. Chiluba appreciates the 
circumstances under which Mr. Mwaanga has resigned. The 
president says he will make a statement soon. Mr. Mwaanga 
announced the resignation in Lusaka this morning, saying he 
would like to give government time to investigate charges of 
drug trafficking leveled against him from various quarters. 
  Meanwhile, the Revolutionary Socialist Party [RSP] has 
described as courageous the move taken by former Foreign Affairs 
Minister Mr. Mwaanga. RSP General Secretary (Baultis Sikakula) 
also added that other leaders should follow Mr. Mwaanga's 
suggestion that they resign to give [words indistinct] ample 
evidence of their involvement in drug trafficking. Mr. 
(Sikakula), however, cautioned the country against bowing to 
pressure from (?foreign countries) in dealing with the matter.

Bureau will not be expected to sell foreign exchange to a person

will be expected to verify each passport to ensure a person is 
illegible to buy foreign exchange. 
  Presently, Zambian residents are free to buy up to $4,000 of 
which $2,000 can be used for [words indistinct] and the other 
$2,000 for purchase of goods.

  [Excerpt] The police central bureau has announced that it 
has released Mr. Lencho Leta and Mr. Ibsa Gutema. It is to be 
recalled that the procurator general of the central government 
recently instituted a criminal charge on various issues against 
Lencho Leta and Ibsa Gutema and that their cases had been under 
review at the central high court and were scheduled to be heard 
on 5 January. 
  The accused, Mr. Lencho Leta and Mr. Ibsa Gutema, in their 
application to the Ministry of Justice of the Transitional 
Government of Ethiopia, submitted that in so far as we believe 
that differences created in the implementation of the tenets of 
the charter can only be resolved peacefully and not through war, 
and in so far as we are ready to make every effort to ensure 
that those concerned work to this end to carry out their 
activities along these lines, we ask for charges against both of 
us to be dropped. 
  After the Ministry of Justice presented the application of 
the accused to the government and after an assessment carried 
out by the government, the government decided to enter a nolle 
prosequi and gave an order for the same to the Ministry of 
Justice through the procurator general on 4 January. [passage

  [Text] Burkina Faso, a member country of the Air Afrique 
Company, is following with interest the evolution of this 
multinational company. Yves Rolland Billecart, Air Afrique's 
managing director, is here in Ouagadougou to hold discussions 
with Burkinabe authorities concerning the necessary change in 
this indispensable tool for air transportation. 
  After arresting the company's financial loss a few years 
ago, 
and after making important investments, such as the purchase of 
the Airbus which increased the transportation capacity of the 
company -- after this stage of spectacular rehabilitation -- Air 
Afrique is faced with new difficulties which demand increased 
support from its member countries. This will be the topic of 
the heads of state meeting which opens on 10 January in Dakar. 
After his audience with Prime Minister Youssouf Ouedraogo this 
morning, Yves Rolland Billecart talked to Gerard Sawadogo 
Koudaogo this. 
  [Begin recording] [Billecart] This visit to Burkina Faso is 
meant to examine problems specific to Burkina Faso. We have 
noted with satisfaction that the exportation of agricultural 
products is going on well this year, thanks to greater 
discipline shown by exporters. It is also due to their 
commitments that Air Afrique has been able to meet the 
corresponding challenges. These were the major topics of my 
discussions with the prime minister. Earlier, I held a working 
session with the minister of transport, then with the minister 
of employment and labor, and with the minister of culture, whose 
many activities demand traveling, as well as with the minister 
of tourism. So, as you can see, the purpose of my visit was to 
discuss the general problems of the company for the Dakar 
conference as well as to discuss (?traveling issues). 
  [Koudaogo] Let us then talk with Rolland Billecart about all 
these problems facing Air Afrique. 
  [Billecart] Air Afrique is suffering from insufficient 
funds. 
When I took over the management of the company, there was no 
more capital because it was less than 15 billion CFA francs. 
Thanks to efforts made by France as well as our results for 
first four years, we were able to build up capital, which was 
good, but still insufficient. Presently, we have capital 
totaling 15 billion CFA francs, but we have a long-term debt of 
80 billion, which came purchasing aircrafts and modernizing our 
installations. Therefore, we need to balance the funds. We had 
drawn up a program which consisted of an assistance from the 
African Development Bank [ADB]. Unfortunately, the ADB board of 
governors did not accept the suggestion of its president and we 
ended up suggesting a new plan which I negotiated with the 
French Government. And it is this program which will be 
examined in Dakar. If, as I expect, this program is accepted, 
Air Afrique might be able to arrange [words indistinct] as far 
its capital or a permanent fund is concerned, and have a more 
balanced financial structure. Contrary to what was said, we 
have not envisaged a restructuring of the company. It was 
restructured in 1989. As you know, this resulted in the 
retrenchment of workers and this time, there is no question of 
retrenching workers. [end recording]

  [Text] The minister of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, says the 
allegations made against South Africa by the Transkeian leader, 
Major General Bantu Holomisa, in a letter to the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] are incomprehensible. Mr. Coetsee was 
apparently reacting to a request by Gen. Holomisa that the TEC 
give serious consideration to asking the United Nations to send 
a peace keeping force to South Africa because this country was 
tardy in forming a national peace keeping force. Mr. Coetsee 
said the government's representative on the TEC's defense 
subcommittee has informed him that there had been dynamic 
progress toward establishing a national peace keeping force.

  [Text] The peace talks will resume in Lusaka tomorrow. The 
government delegation left Luanda this afternoon. Our 
correspondent was at the airport and spoke to Faustino Muteka, 
head of the government delegation. He did not disclose anything 
new. 
  [Begin recording] [Muteka] We are negotiating. It has been 
agreed that there should be discretion. So, I would not like to 
hinder the talks in any way. 
  [Reporter] If it depended on the government delegation, how 
long it would take to find a settlement? 
  [Muteka] If the other side adopts an unwavering attitude, we 
will need more time to study ways of reaching consensus and 
signing an accord. 
  [Reporter] Does the government delegation has enough powers 
so that it will not need to return to Luanda to receive new 
instructions? 
  [Muteka] It is not like that. The government team has full 
powers. It is the government delegation... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Is there any consensus? 
  [Muteka] We must discuss any new developments with the 
government. [end recording] 
  So, the delegation remains discreet. The composition of the 
government delegation has not been disclosed. There are no 
details about the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola delegation, although it has been reported that its 
members are in Kinshasa. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special 
representative in Angola, has asked that the talks should resume 
at 1600 tomorrow because he intends to fulfill his schedule. 
This morning he was in Libreville and in the afternoon in 
Kinshasa. He intends to meet the U.S. Congress delegation 
tomorrow morning.

  [Excerpts] Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, prime minister 
and head of government today addressed officers of the 
Brazzaville Garrison. At the center of that address, which took 
place in the conference room of Hydro-Congo company, was the 
restructuring of the Congolese Armed Forces and their 
integration into development. Other issues were also examined at 
the meeting, in particular problems of security and keeping 
order. [passage omitted] Let us listen to the prime minister as 
he talked about the restructuring of the public security force 
and its present challenges: 
  [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] On the domestic field, our 
public force was not effectively prepared to face the new 
dangers that faced us, such as the massive distribution of 
weapons and of war munitions to the civilian population; the 
destruction and sabotage of public infrastructures and 
buildings; looting; barricades; dastardly assassinations; armed 
robberies; raping; and narcotics. All these crimes constitute 
for the public force and for the authorities challenges that 
must be met. Taking into account the [word indistinct] of the 
problems raised, the government was of the view that the 
reorganization of the public force, in view of the present 
constitutional and political situations, constitutes a decisive 
step towards the objectives we want to attain. This is why a 
document relating to this reorganization has been drafted and is 
currently being examined by the parliament. [end recording] 
  The prime minister, Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, also 
spoke 
about the recruitment of Congolese youths into our Armed Forces, 
a recruitment exercise which became a reality today as the 
president of the Republic, Professor Pascal Lissouba, signed the 
order for the recruiting of a contingent of 2,000 youths. 
Concerning this recruitment exercise, the prime minister 
informed the officers of the Brazzaville garrison about the 
objectives of this exercise. Listen to Jacques Joachim 
Yhombi-Opango: 
  [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] This recruitment will enable 
us to reduce or to solve the staffing problem and will also 
contribute to raising the number of junior officers within the 
public force. The Congolese Armed Forces alone will receive 
about 33 percent of the recruits. Any military force draws its 
ability from the enthusiasm, the spontaneity, and the commitment 
of the youths. The mission which the head of state has 
entrusted upon us is to replace our public force considerably 
with younger blood, in order to make it an efficient and 
result-oriented tool in the service of the nation. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpts] The National Assembly ended its extraordinary 
session at the Parliamentary Palace in the afternoon of 4 
January. The closing ceremony was chaired by National Assembly 
speaker Andre Milongo. A plenary session was held in the 
morning of the same day, during which the 1994 state budget was 
adopted. Andre Mimossi, a permanent correspondent at the 
Parliamentary Palace, has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Mimossi] [passage omitted] During the 
extraordinary session, parliamentarians discussed the major item 
of their deliberations, which is no other than the 1994 
financial draft bill, that is the state budget for this year, as 
well as the basis upon which it was drafted, namely the economic 
and social recovery plan known as PARESO [expansion unknown]. 
The 1994 budget, which was adopted by the National Assembly is 
nearly 166 billion CFA francs, that is 38.64 billion CFA francs 
less than the figure for last year. By adopting the text 
submitted to it at the session, the National Assembly has just 
paved the way for a reassuring future for Congo. Assembly 
speaker Andre Milongo pointed out the importance of this text. 
  [Milongo] During the deliberations, the honorable 
parliamentarians examined the various draft bills which would 
enable us in the very near future to set up local councils and 
allow for unrestricted management of local authorities. With 
the adoption of this text our country has taken a major step in 
the march toward the country's decentralization and 
municipalization. I am convinced that this praiseworthy policy 
will contribute to the development of our regions and 
municipalities through the control and valorization of their own 
human, economic, and technical resources. However, it must be 
stressed that the step being taken is realistic and cautious 
because in the first stage, only the regions and municipalities 
will be upgraded into administrative entities. During the same 
session, our honorable assembly also examined and adopted the 
1994 appropriation bill, as well as the action program for 
economic and social recovery, PARESO, which accompanies it. 
These measures will enable the government to reorganize and 
improve the economic and social fabric which is now in a 
shambles. [passage omitted] 
  I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our 
honorable parliamentarians for all the initiatives taken, which 
led to the adoption of the statement on the restoration of peace 
in the country at their congress meeting on 16 December 1993. I 
hope that there will soon be a return to peace now that the 
measures included in the statement have been effectively 
implemented. I, therefore, urge all the honorable 
parliamentarians, and I repeat, honorable parliamentarians to 
work tirelessly and above all sincerely for peace in their 
various constituencies because working for peace means ensuring 
one's own security. Collective security is the best security.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Exchanges of fire 
between Congolese government forces and opposition militiamen 
resumed here overnight Tuesday after a two-day lull, leaving one 
person dead, witnesses said. Army tanks returned fire against 
opposition militiamen who fired machine guns around the national 
television building and the Saint Exupery school in 
Brazzaville's southwestern Bacongo district, the witnesses said. 
A Malian national was killed in the crossfire as he passed by 
the school on a motorbike, according to a hospital source, 
bringing the death toll since early December to at least 95. 
  Calm had returned to the capital by midday Wednesday, 
witnesses said, although public transportation was still 
interrupted in the Bacongo district. Elsewhere in the capital, 
security forces carried out search operations for illegal 
Zairean immigrants, whom the government has accused of belonging 
to the opposition militia. 
  Prime Minister General Joachim Yhombi-Opango said Wednesday 
that the government would not use force against the civilian 
population, but that the security forces would "render harmless 
all marginals who have not understood the democratic process." 
Addressing officers of the Brazzaville military garrison, 
General Opango said a "systematic recycling" of President Pascal 
Lissouba's personal security forces would be carried out. 
  The opposition coalition has complained on several occasions 
that the president's security units were responsible for 
violence in the capital. 
  General Opango called for more discipline among the army, 
the 
police and the gendarmerie, which he said must "remain 
apolitical but obedient to civilian power." He also confirmed 
the president's December 31 announcement that a recruitment of 
army soldiers would be held "in all districts of the country in 
order to purify its ranks." 
  Soldiers currently account for a mere 33 percent of army 
personnel, with the rest comprising officers and 
non-commissioned officers, the prime minister explained. The 
last recruitment drive for the armed forces, which currently 
total about 20,000 men, was held in 1983. 
  In the meantime, the opposition coalition announced that it 
favoured the formation of a national union government to bring 
an end to the country's political crisis. Opposition leader 
Bernard Kolelas said in a statement that the new government 
should be formed after the arbitration commission announces its 
verdict on the contested results of the recent legislative 
elections. 
  The commission is to publish its report on February 5.

  [Excerpt] Rwanda today entered its transitional period, 
enlarged by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. The transition 
will last 22 months. This period was begun this morning at 1000 
by the president of the Republic, Juvenal Habyarimana, who was 
solemnly sworn in before the national [word indistinct] and the 
constitutional court. So we now have the first institution of 
the transition. Here is the oath, given by President Juvenal 
Habyarimana: 
  [Begin Habyarimana recording] I, Habyarimana Juvenal, in the 
name of almighty God, solemnly swear before the nation that I 
will loyally fulfill my functions, remain faithful to the 
Republic of Rwanda, respect the state institutions and promote 
the interests of the Rwandan people while respecting the basic 
law and other laws. [applause] [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Rwanda entered the great transition today, 
enlarged by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Habyarimana recording] Excellencies, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, my sincere thanks for responding to my invitation, 
for being here. I have invited you to this morning's ceremony. 
I have especially invited the relevant people. However, just 
like you, I have noted that the president of the Constitutional 
Court is not present. I would like to recall Article 7 of the 
agreement on the various questions and final dispositions. 
Article 7 says in its penultimate paragraph that the deputies 
to the transitional assembly shall swear before the president of 
the Republic in the presence of the president of the 
Constitutional Court. As the president of the Constitutional 
Court is not here, the disposition cannot be fulfilled. 
  I also note that no deputy of the RPF is present. Those I 
asked to check on those present have told me about this, that no 
deputy of the RPF is present in the hall and that no deputy of 
the Social Democratic Party is present. This is in addition to 
the absence of the president of the Constitutional Court. 
  Therefore, it is my duty to postpone the session, but I 
remain ready to convene it again once the relevant people are 
present, that is to say the deputies who will be sworn in, and 
once the authorities mentioned in Article 7 are available to 
accomplish their duties. 
  Therefore, I am postponing the session. I once again thank 
you for being here, for troubling yourselves. I would like to 
make a special call, especially to those not present, and to the 
international community, especially our friends who accompanied 
us to Arusha for more than one year to negotiate the peace 
agreement, for each of us to make a real and obvious effort, so 
that the international community can assist us. Also I hope 
that Rwanda sets up the transitional institutions as planned in 
the Arusha agreement, first of all the transitional national 
assembly, and then the broad-based transitional government. 
  In addition to my thanks, I wish you a good evening. The 
session has therefore been postponed for the reasons given and I 
am ready to reconvene it once the difficulties that we 
encountered this evening have been resolved. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] For several weeks, the Rwandan people have been 
waiting impatiently for the creation of the transitional 
institutions. [passage omitted] 
  President Habyarimana, in his afternoon speech, stressed 
that 
the ceremony had been postponed because the president of the 
Constitutional Court and many of the deputies designated by some 
political parties were absent. It is good to note the absence. 
But, it is not enough. There is also need for one to ask one's 
self what the reasons for the absence were. 
  Contrary to what is said by some of our colleagues at Radio 
Kigali, our country has not entered the period of broad-based 
transition. The transitional period will only start when the 
broad-based government starts functioning. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the African National Congress in </F>
Marshalltown on 5 January 1994] 
  [Text] On the weekend of the 18th and 19th of December 
1993, the 14 regions of the ANC [African National Congress] 
comprising delegates from ANC branches, Cosatu [Congress of 
South African Trade Unions], SACP [South African Communist 
Party], Mass Democratic Movement and PF [Patriotic Front] forces 
voted to nominate candidates for the National Assembly and the 
lists for the various provincial legislatures. These 
nominations have now been made available to all the regions. 
  It must, however, be pointed out that the lists of 
nominations that have been sent to the regions are only 
provisional. All of those who have been nominated have not yet 
been informed, many of them may still decide not to stand, or 
may opt to keep their positions in their respective 
organisations or apply for positions in the civil service. 
Provincial conferences to consolidate the nominations of the 14 
regions will be held over the forthcoming weekend of the 8th and 
9th of January. A national list conference to finalise all the 
lists will be held on the 15th of January. The National 
Executive Committee of the ANC will publicly announce the final 
lists on Tuesday 18th January.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Party's Federal Council on </F>
5 January] 
  [Text] It seems as if the ANC's [African National Congress] 
PWV [Pretoria -Witwatersrand - Vereeniging] region is repeating 
the mistakes of the Western Cape ANC, in compiling their 
candidates list. Names of prominent people are being used to 
give credibility to the list without their consent. 
  This undemocratic procedure causes grave embarrassment to 
people who differ fundamentally with ANC policy and are public 
figures who do not want to become embroiled in political 
controversy. The way in which the ANC goes about compiling 
their candidates lists indicates a shocking disrespect for the 
individual. 
  These embarrassing incidents also prove that the ANC is 
still 
trapped in their one-party-state-of-mind. It is time that they 
accept that the essence of democracy is freedom of choice. 
Appointing people on to your electoral lists without their 
permission is further proof of the ANC's disregard for basic 
democratic procedure and values. 
  It is indeed a sign of the political bankruptcy of the ANC 
if 
they have to revert to these kinds of gimmicks, to draw 
attention to their candidates lists and to attempt to lend it 
glamour.

  [Text] An Israeli newspaper says the ANC [African National 
Congress] has sought help from the Israeli army in working out 
an education program for black recruits in a new South African 
army. The newspaper quoted Israeli military sources as saying an 
ANC delegation visited Israel 2 weeks ago to gather information 
on the army's special program for recruits who fail their 
studies. 
  The delegation reportedly met the head of the education 
department in the Israeli army and visited several centers where 
army students are trained. The paper says the delegation said 
it was facing difficulty in enrolling young blacks with no 
education and they hoped to adopt methods being used in Israel.

  [Text] Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front, AVF] leader 
General Constand Viljoen says the establishment of a national 
peacekeeping force is only a political requirement and a waste 
of taxpayers' money. The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] 
subcouncil on defense yesterday said the 10,000-strong force 
would be deployed in election hot-spots by the end of March. 
  The AVF leader has reiterated that his organization rejects 
all TEC structures as a waste of taxpayers' money and energy, 
because he says they try to solve South Africa's problems in a 
one-sided manner. Viljoen says the country's police and defense 
force's command structure should not be tampered with, because 
they stand [word indistinct]. 
  Meanwhile, the Conservative Party [CP] says it won't 
recognize the authority of the command structure of the national 
peace-keeping force or joint defense force. CP deputy leader 
Willie Snyman says the peace-keeping force will fall under the 
complete control of the TEC's subcouncil on defense and Snyman 
says the TEC, which is the product of multiparty talks, is 
nothing but a seizure of power by communist terrorists. He says 
therefore the CP does not recognize the powers of the TEC and 
the powers and actions of the comnmand structure of the national 
peace keeping force.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 5 SAPA -- The "violence paradise" that 
the country had become vindicated the Conservative Party's [CP] 
predictions of anarchy, murder and robbery in the new South 
Africa, CP Chief Secretary Lem Theron said on Wednesday. 
  Dr. Theron urged conservative-minded citizens to reject the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] and the interim 
constitution which had facilitated the chaos and to "let their 
voices be heard to counter the disaster of communist tyranny". 
  The situation could be expected to deteriorate in coming 
months and years because Marxist Communist revolutionaries in 
Russia and Eastern Europe had proved they harbored no respect 
for life, he said. 
  Dr. Theron said several newspaper reports published on 
Wednesday confirmed the fraud and the false expectations of a 
peace utopia created by State President F W de Klerk. 
  These included reports on gangs armed with AK47s attacking 
flats; train violence; an African National Congress [ANC] 
admission that some self-defense units were out of control; 
vehicles being set alight after warnings; police fearing for the 
life of a teenager in a hijacked minibus, four robbers with a 
trail from Transkei to the Western Transvaal being linked to two 
murders; the ANC's determination to drive National Party members 
out of Soweto and several murders and robberies. 
  The new South Africa had become a place where only communist 
rulers and their bribed facilitators would be able to live 
securely after the April 27 election, he added. "Repression, 
exploitation and possibly even penal camps are the destiny of 
those who dare to oppose the so-called peace democracy of 
Communism..."

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 6 SAPA -- Two "confirmed" Azanian 
Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] members have been arrested in 
connection with the Heidelberg tavern massacre in Cape Town, Law 
and Order Minister Hernus Kriel announced on Thursday. They have 
been positively linked to the Heidelberg Tavern killings, Mr 
Kriel said in a statement. "These arrests brings to four the 
number of suspects being held in connection with this attack. 
Further arrests are not excluded," the statement said. 
  Both suspects, aged 24 and 22, were arrested earlier this 
week in Elliot in South African territory whilst travelling 
between two destinations in the Trankskei. 
  The arrest of the two members of the Pan Africanist 
Congress' 
[PAC] armed wing, coupled with investigations, had verified the 
finding by the Goldstone Commission that the Transkei was indeed 
a "safe haven for killers exporting terrorism to South Africa", 
Mr Kriel said. 
  The South African Police [SAP] was investigating whether all 
four suspects were linked to other terror atrocities in the 
western Cape. This "major breakthrough" further emphasised the 
urgent necessity for the Transkei to co-operate in establishing 
a joint SAP/Transkei police investigation team to further probe 
the matter, said Mr Kriel.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Government Unable To 'Govern With a Firm Hand' -- "The 
government does not seem to have any plan of action for halting 
the violence in the run-up to the election, being unable to act 
decisively for fear of ANC [African National Congress] 
reaction," declares the page 6 editorial in Johannesburg THE 
CITIZEN in English on 4 January. "Is it too much to expect the 
government to govern with a firm hand until the election decides 
whether it is put out of office?" "Weakness in that regard is to 
the disadvantage of both, because, to put it simply, both are 
held to blame for what is happening and both need to ensure that 
not only is the playing field levelled, but nobody tries to dig 
it up or disrupt the decisive election match that will be played 
on it shortly." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Self-Defense Units Part of Violence in Townships -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 6 January in a page 12 
editorial believes township self-defense units, SDUs, "are part 
of the problem of violence in the East Rand townships of 
Katlehong, Vosloorus and Thokoza." THE STAR has established 
that "internecine warfare between rival SDUs in Katlehong is a 
factor in the bloodletting in the township. As an ANC official 
in Katlehong notes, ANC supporters find themselves in conflict 
with one another. His statement is important for another 
reason: it repudiates the official mythology that SDUs are 
apolitical rather than ANC-aligned organisations. The ANC 
admits that it has to intervene to restructure SDUs in the 
troubled East Rand townships." THE STAR concludes from the East 
Rand violence and the ANC admissions that withdrawing the 
Internal Stability Division from the townships "will aggravate 
rather than solve the problem, as the Goldstone Commission 
warned last month." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Negotiating Urgency Has 'Dissipated' -- "Constitutional 
negotiations and the operations of the Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] are being conducted in a rather desultory and 
sloppy manner," says a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 6 January. The editorial refers to the 
"arm-twisting between the Freedom Alliance [FA] on one hand and 
the NP [National Party] and ANC on the other over preconditions 
for further talks," saying "it seems that we have returned to 
the phase of 'talks about talks' which, when conducted between 
the ANC and NP, went on for years. That kind of time is no 
longer available." "Exacerbating this problem is the fact that 
almost all the TEC decisions taken in the absence of the Freedom 
Alliance create new problems and obstacles to a final 
settlement." The "refreshing sense of urgency" demonstrated by 
negotiators in November "has all dissipated now." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Self-Defense Units 'Banditry' in Townships -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 6 January in a page 6 editorial comments 
on the "war" among self-defense units on the East Rand, saying 
the SDUs "quickly deteriorate into armed bandits." It is a 
tragedy that "they have to do work that the police should be 
doing," and that "they are not answerable to anybody." It is 
"laudable" that the ANC is "trying to rein them in," but "the 
problem has to be tackled at a much deeper level to stop 
banditry in the name of self defence in the townships."

  [Text] National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] and government negotiators have already arrived in the 
Zambian capital, Lusaka, where the second round of Angolan peace 
talks will be held. Secrecy will still be the strategy of the 
first round, following the methods of UN Special Representative 
Alioune Blondin Beye. Meanwhile, it has been agreed that 
political, and not military issues, will dominate the agenda of 
the talks. On the occasion of the resumption of talks yesterday 
afternoon, Radio France International, RFI, interviewed Dr. 
Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who began by commenting on issues to 
be negotiated. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] The first point is the police, 
but a modern and democratic police, not a police with a 
paramilitary and military organization, but a civil police 
force, such as in civilized and highly democratic countries. We 
will discuss the police and we can say now that we will not 
agree with the so called belligerent and military police, such 
as the antiriot police. We want structures which may guarantee 
total security for the population and democratic freedom in the 
country, not a police force created to oppress the opposition 
parties. 
  Our second point will be the big, multifaceted theme, 
national reconciliation, with issues regarding the government, 
the status of our President Dr. Savimbi, and the political and 
administrative decentralization which is extremely necessary to 
create acceptable structures which may unite the Angolan people, 
which has been traumatized and divided following the so called 
October 1992 Luanda events. Then we shall also discuss freedom 
of association, politically, and economically. This means that 
we will be dealing with extremely sensible issues, including the 
second round of elections, how democratic elections should be 
organized to guarantee a free expression. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] government [word 
indistinct] key ministerial posts? 
  [Valentim] [Words indistinct] ministerial key posts. We 
would like to have one post in the Defense or Interior Ministry, 
one post in the Foreign Affairs or Information Ministry and one 
post in the Territorial Administration or Economy. We would 
like to participate in government in an effective way, not like 
in the 1992 [word indistinct] when they gave us the ministry 
[words indistinct] not in the context of France, but in Angola's 
context, for us to take care of drums; that is not what we want. 
We want a participation which is a sign that Angola is truly 
heading toward national reconciliation. We also want UNITA's 
participation in the management of some economic enterprises, 
such as the National Angolan Fuel Company, the railroad company 
and others. We are still living in a society of the past, a 
monolithic society, in which all workers belong to the party, in 
which other parties do not participate in the economic and 
political activities, because we did not have time to prepare 
the country for an open democracy.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] leadership has categorically denied allegations 
reported by the Luanda regime's press that Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] troops bombed Malanje yesterday when 
the aircraft carrying U.S. congressmen was about to land. A 
source close to the FALA General Staff has said that such 
statements are a pretext by the Luanda regime to cover 
offensives launched by its forces in the area. Our source said 
there is no reason to investigate who, in fact, is responsible 
for what happened because this is part of a powerful propaganda 
campaign by the Eduardo dos Santos regime, which is searching 
for approval in the eyes of the U.S. Government. The same 
source said this is the second attack of this kind since the 
failed attempt to incriminate UNITA as responsible for the 
attack on Malongo in Cabinda Province. Our source concluded by 
appealing to the international community not to be taken in by 
the fallacious propaganda of the Luanda regime, since they are 
bent on boycotting the round of talks.

  [Text] The shelling of Malanje by the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] killed one person and 
wounded nine people, one seriously. Francisco Kuringana reports. 
  The action took place precisely at a time when the aircraft 
which was carrying U.S. congressmen -- who were expected in 
Malanje today -- was about to land. Local circles view this as 
another maneuver aimed at interrupting on-the-ground 
observations of the main problems affecting thousands of 
citizens in this part of the country because of the war caused 
by UNITA and the problems experienced by the Angolan people in 
all fields.

  [Text] The search for peace has resumed in the Zambian 
capital, Lusaka. However, the main strategy of Luanda is to 
continue exterminating the populations within the framework of 
the prolonged political and tribal genocide, while it falsely 
sings the song of negotiations. Our central news desk yesterday 
received reports from Uige that two SU-22 fighters coming from 
Luanda dropped a deadly cargo of bombs over the cities of Uige 
Negage and Quitexe. Many civilians were killed and others 
wounded. However, we do not have exact information and numbers 
of casualties caused by yet another barbarous action by the 
Futungo de Belas Palace.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Machado da Graca on the "Dotting the i's" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The accusations made by Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] leader, against Mozambican Army 
General Domingos Fondo has created a new situation in our 
country's political scenario. The Mozambican media have long 
reported that the public feels some figures are involved in 
dealings which range from somewhat shady to very dark. No one 
has, however, been able to piece together enough evidence to 
point out specific names and place the dots on the i's. 
  In his news conference in Maringue, Renamo leader Afonso 
Dhlakama took a step forward and indicated one name, that of 
Domingos Fondo, whom he accused of being involved in smuggling 
arms to South Africa. The Renamo leader went even further and 
said that President Joaquim Chissano was aware of it. Nothing 
can stay quite the same in the face of this new situation. 
Beginning with the attorney general, our legal structures 
simply cannot stand and wait for some unidentified person to 
come up with evidence. At this stage, the matter rests between 
two citizens: Afonso Dhlakama, who has made an accusation in 
public and who must be in possession of the relevant evidence, 
and Domingos Fondo, who has been publicly accused and who must 
respond to Dhlakama's evidence with other evidence and witnesses 
to prove his innocence. That is what one calls a legal state. 
  The normal thing to do under such circumstances is for Gen. 
Domingos Fondo to institute legal proceedings against Renamo 
leader Afonso Dhlakama for defamation and offensive remarks that 
could jeopardize his reputation. In turn, the court must 
establish who is in the right and penalize whoever is in the 
wrong. Things could follow a different path, though: Were the 
accusation only about purely individual interests, the matter 
could be laid to rest. It would be enough for Gen. Fondo to 
ignore those accusations. That accusation, however, involves a 
very serious crime and the simple fact that such an accusation 
has been made in public should force the Attorney General's 
Office to open an inquiry to investigate the truth of the 
charges. There is no escaping that responsibility. 
  What is more, we all hope that the Attorney General's Office 
will not tell us yet again that it does not have the material 
means for conducting the investigation.

  [Text] It took a lot of persuading to get the fighting 
forces in Mozambique to go to the United Nations assembly points 
for disarmament and demobilization. Especially, it seems, the 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] rebels, they finally 
began turning up at the camps before Christmas but apparently 
didn't like what they found or rather didn't find, in particular 
basic facilities and the lack of food, water, and clothing. 
Well, now, up to 600 Renamo soldiers are reported to have 
walked out of camps in central Sofala Province. Renamo's 
spokesman Almeida dos Santos called us up this afternoon and Dan 
Isaacs asked him if it was true that the soldiers were quitting 
the assembly areas. 
  [Begin recording] [Dos Santos] Yes, this is really true. We 
have received reports that in Chiramba, one of the assembly 
points, the soldiers have been leaving. Unfortunately, when 
President Dhlakama recently visited one of these assembly 
points, he discovered that the soldiers had no food and they had 
no clothing. Not only that, the huts in which they were living 
in, they were very poor, I would say sort of tents which are 
just plastic [word indistinct] that have been distributed to 
them, instead of giving them real tents. 
  [Isaacs] Mr. dos Santos, I find it a little bit difficult to 
believe when I have just spoken to the United Nations who say 
there are a few local problems, but on the whole, food and 
clothing are getting through to the assembly areas? 
  [Dos Santos] Well, probably since that visit that President 
Dhlakama had made to Chiramba assembly point, we have not had a 
follow up to this, because the United Nations, in the name of 
Dr. Aldo Ajello, had promised that it would send in a helicopter 
that would carry the president to also visit the other assembly 
points. If they had improved the situation, I am quite sure that 
our soldiers would not have moved out of this assembly point. 
  [Isaacs] Afonso Dhlakama, the Renamo leader, and now you, 
yourself, have been complaining about conditions in the camps 
and the Renamo soldiers themselves are voting with [words 
indistinct] by leaving some of these camps. What do you propose 
to do? What do you plan to ask the United Nations now to do? 
  [Dos Santos] We have got to force the United Nations to make 
sure that they actually create these conditions and in the 
meantime, I think the main thing that we could do is to ask the 
United Nations, jointly with our members who are in the 
Cease-Fire Commission, to go round to make sure that they try to 
put back the whole situation. [end recording]

forces in Mozambique to go to the United Nations assembly points 
for disarmament and demobilization, especially, it seems, the 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] rebels. They finally 
began turning up at the camps before Christmas, but apparently 
didn't like what they found or did not find, in particular the 
poor facilities and the lack of food, water, and clothing. Now, 
up to 600 Renamo soldiers are reported to have walked out of the 
camps in central Sofala Province. On the line to Maputo, Dan 
Isaacs asked Tom Cadel of the UN mission, Unomoz, who is in 
charge of the demobilization operation how he responded to the 
Renamo complaints. 
  [Begin recording] [Cadel] Yesterday, we have identified this 
problem and it was informed to Renamo delegation. The Renamo 
delegation at the Cease-Fire Commission said that they were not 
aware of this problem and that it would immediately check and 
then take appropriate action. 
  [Isaacs] Now, this isn't the first time that this has 
happened. Renamo soldiers a few weeks ago apparently went on 
hunger strike, complaining about the quality or the lack of 
food. Do you think that there are real problems getting enough 
food to the assembly areas? 
  [Cadel] I don't think there are any problems at all. There 
is a basic agreement between the World Food Program which is 
providing food to the assembly areas and the government. Unomoz 
offered that in the cases where there are difficulties in 
logistics that it could help. At the same time, on Renamo side, 
we had proposed, in the additional funding that Unomoz obtained, 
to provide some additional items, like dried meat, dried fish, 
and salt to Renamo assembly areas. 
  [Isaacs] And yet there do seem to be problems because Renamo 
personnel are walking out of assembly areas. Clearly, they are 
upset about something? 
  [Cadel] My position here at the moment, I am not aware of 
the 
exact reason, nor Renamo head of delegation yesterday in the 
Cease-Fire Commission was able to explain to the commission what 
reason could be. 
  [Isaacs] Now, apart from these problems there do appear to 
be 
a large number of Renamo and government soldiers arriving in 
assembly areas. What are the latest figures on those? 
  [Cadel] The latest figures are that on the government side, 
8,334 soldiers have arrived. On the Renamo side, 4,632, adding 
up to a total of 12,966. 
  [Isaacs] Now, that is quite a large number but it is slower 
than the UN had anticipated. Do you think the proposed election 
date of October of this year is possible, given those 
limitations? 
  [Cadel] I think from the demobilization point of view, 
definitely, it is very well possible. Of course, it depends 
here on the inputs from both parties to provide the information 
on which people are going to the new army and which people, they 
will be demobilized and this can be a fact that it will delay a 
little bit, but in the overall planning, technically, we still 
have a [word indistinct] of one month spare, we can call it. 
So, we are still confident that we can finalize the 
demobilization till the end of May. 
  [Isaacs] And therefore elections are possible in October? 
  [Cadel] And therefore elections should be possible in 
October. [end recording]

  [Text] Raul Domingos, head of the Political Affairs 
Department of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], told 
our correspondent this afternoon that his movement's forces will 
continue to abandon assembly points if logistical conditions are 
not improved. Raul Domingos said Renamo's withdrawal from the 
Chiramba and Magunde assembly points was an indication that food 
supplies are not being taken into account by the international 
community. He noted that Renamo soldiers could go without basic 
facilities at their bases, but not in assembly points. Domingos 
urged the international community to take into account the 
question of food and clothing for Renamo forces. He said the 
situation is serious and demanded that the international 
community should intervene immediately to prevent situations 
likely to endanger the peace process. He added that everything 
will be done to see to it that those who abandon the assembly 
points will return as soon as possible, though this depends on 
better logistical conditions.

  [Text] Government Major Eduardo Lauchande says no consensus 
has yet been reached with the Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] regarding the latter's withdrawal from Salamanga. 
Speaking at the end of a tripartite meeting attended by the 
government, Renamo, and UN Operations in Mozambique officials in 
Maputo today, Maj. Lauchande said Renamo agreed to inform the 
chairman of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] by tomorrow morning 
about the area where its men will be deployed. 
  The government has rejected Renamo's suggestion that its 
forces withdraw up to 700 meters from where they are stationed. 
CCF chairman Colonel (Sitela) says the dispute could be 
resolved if Renamo accepts the proposals that have been made. 
Renamo is supposed to withdraw 30 km south of Salamanga or 10 
km northeast of the town, instead of 700 meters.

  [Text] The lead story in the DAILY GRAPHIC is the smashing 
of a passports syndicate by the narcotics unit of the police. 
The syndicate, uncovered at a spot near the (?Crepys) Hotel in 
Accra, is suspected to be run by drug barons. The GRAPHIC 
quotes the deputy superintendent of police in charge of the 
narcotics unit, Mr. Robert Ayalindu, as saying that eight 
people, including the owner of the spot, have been arrested. 
  Fifty-nine international and diplomatic passports were also 
seized during the operation. The passports are from the 
Bahamas, Liberia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Kenya, and 
Canada. Some have American visas issued in them while others 
have visible signs that the original pictures have been taken 
off with the view to inserting new pictures.

  [Text] Lisbon, 4 Jan (AFP) -- President Joao Bernardo 
Vieira has assured that the trial of about 50 Guinea-Bissau 
opposition members accused of an attempted coup, including Joao 
da Costa the chairman of the Party for Renovation and 
Development, will be conducted fairly and legally. 
  "I guarantee that this trial will be conducted in the strict 
observance of the laws in force in the country and in line with 
international rules in the matter," the Guinea-Bissau head of 
state said in his answer to Portuguese head of state, Mario 
Soares, who wrote to him at the end of December to express the 
hope of seeing "caution" and "openness" guide this trial. 
  President Vieira, in his letter published by the LUSA AGENCY 
just before the opening of the trial on 4 January, denies the 
allegations that the date of da Costa's trial was set up 
hastily. "All the steps of the criminal procedure have been 
scrupulously observed," President Vieira assured in his letter 
to Mr. Soares.

  [Text] Lagos, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Two journalists working for 
the independent [THE] GUARDIAN newspaper were severely beaten up 
by Nigerian security agents responsible for demolishing illegal 
buildings, official Lagos television reported late Tuesday [4 
January]. 
  When the two journalists, who were on assignment to cover 
the 
demolition exercise in Mushin on the outskirts of Lagos, were 
shown on the television, they could hardly walk. One of them 
was almost naked as his clothes were torn following the beating. 
  The security agents were members of a environmental 
sanitation special task force set up by the Lagos state 
government to demolish about 300 shops and buildings in Mushin 
which had made it impossible to construct a government hospital. 
  The demolition exercise started Tuesday following the expiry 
of a one-week ultimatum given to the owners of the buildings by 
state military administrator Colonel Olagunsoye Oyinlola to 
vacate the area or face demolition of the structures. 
  THE GUARDIAN newspaper protested against the maltreatment of 
the journalists amd the government sent officials to apologise, 
the newspaper reported Wednesday here.

  [Text] Lome, 5 Jan (AFP) -- A shoot-out punctuated by 
explosions broke out shortly after 1815 GMT today in Lome, 
apparently near the Inter-Arms Regiment [RIT] military camp 
located near the city center. Shots, volleys, and explosions 
continued almost uninterruptedly at 1900 GMT. No information 
has so far been obtained from any official source on the cause 
or exact location of the shooting. For security reasons, it has 
not been possible to go to the area. A soldier contacted by 
telephone at the RIT camp refused to comment and hung up 
immediately, shouting: "There is no one around." 
  According to an informed source, there had been reports that 
Head of State General Gnassingbe Eyadema was at 1900 in the 
company of Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh at his private Lome II 
residence, a few kilometers from the camp. His official 
residence where he normally spends the night is located within 
the RIT barracks. As soon as the first shots were heard, panic 
gripped inhabitants of the capital and the streets got deserted 
within a matter of minutes as the night began to fall. In March 
last year, Gen. Eyadema narrowly escaped an attack launched by a 
group of armed men against his RIT camp residence. The 
government then blamed that operation on the opposition in exile.

  [Text] Lome, 5 Jan (AFP) -- The Army and the Gendarmerie 
appear to have gotten the situation under control in Lome today 
by 2200 GMT, four hours after an attack launched by unidentified 
"elements" on the Togolese Inter-Arms Regiment [RIT] camp, the 
main military barracks in the capital. Soldiers and gendarmes 
were patrolling the city center and virtually no gunshots are 
heard any more. According to a source close to the Army, the 
clashes with automatic weapons, grenades, and, apparently, 
rocket launchers may have left "several dead." The same source 
asserts that the attackers whose number was not specified were 
on the run and that some of them had headed toward the Ghanaian 
border which is contiguous with the [Togolese] capital.

  [Text] Lome, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Togolese security forces have 
shot dead seven members of an armed group which made an abortive 
attempt Wednesday to seize the army camp in Lome housing the 
official residence of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. 
  An informed source said the seven dressed in military 
fatigues were shot while travelling in two jeeps. The 
authorities have not identified the attackers referring to them 
only as "armed elements". 
  Earlier a source close to the army said the fighting with 
automatic weapons, grenades, and even rockets, had left "several 
dead". 
  Eyadema, whose official residence is inside the military 
camp 
in Lome, was not there when the attack was launched on Wednesday 
evening. He and Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh were at 
Eyadema's private residence less than two kilometers (a mile) 
from the camp. 
  Five of the assailants were said to have been killed as they 
were driving to the president's private residence. The other 
two were shot while trying to flee over the border adjoining the 
capital, into Ghana. 
  Loyal troops and paramilitary gendarmes appeared late 
Wednesday to have the situation under control. Shooting and 
explosions which started at 6:15 pm had (1815 GMT) almost died 
out at 9:30 pm. 
  In a communique broadcast on television shortly after 2000 
hours, the Defence Ministry said the attackers' aim was to 
"surround the camp and close in on the people inside". It said 
the country's land borders had been sealed and that a curfew had 
been imposed until 6:00 AM Thursday. 
  The camp was the target of a similar attack last March which 
the government blamed on exiled political opponents of the 
regime. 
  The new attack comes six months after Eyadema was reelected 
in a vote boycotted by the opposition. It also comes two weeks 
before Togo's first democratic legislative elections which the 
opposition claims are being sabotaged in advance through poor 
preparation. 
  Eighty-one French military observers and another 42 from 
Burkina Faso have been arriving since the start of the week to 
monitor the election and to ensure the army stays neutral.

  [Text] As a result of the events which occurred on the 
evening of 5 January and which led to the firing of shots at 
different areas in the capital, as well as the imposition of a 
curfew, the government calls on the people of Lome and its 
environs to remain calm and not to leave their homes. All 
workers in the public and private sectors are urged not to 
report to work today in order to enable the security forces, who 
have routed the attackers who came from Ghana, to deal with the 
situation. 
  It all began shortly after 1800 on 5 January, when sporadic 
shots from automatic weapons were heard at the Dove of Peace 
Monument, CICA-Toyota, and Tokoin-Ramco. According to a 
statement issued by the national defense minister, the 
attackers' aim was to surround the Togolese Inter-Arms Regiment 
camp, capture the soldiers, and repeat the 25 March 1993 events. 
  A curfew was imposed from 1800 to 0600 in Lome municipality 
and its environs, and all land borders have been closed until 
further notice.

  [Text] Togo has slipped back into violence just two weeks 
before the holding of parliamentary elections. Seven people died 
following an attack on the Inter-Arms Regiment camp in Lome on 5 
January. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] A curfew has been imposed in 
Lome. Olabire da Cruz has the details: 
  [Begin recording] Sporadic gunshots were heard again this 
morning at 0600, especially near the military camp and the 
airport. The Army and the Gendarmerie, who seem to have the 
situation under control, have erected barricades all over to 
dislodge the attackers, who, according to a government 
communique, came from Ghana. The government has asked the 
people in Lome and its environs to remain calm and stay at home 
today to enable the security forces to deal with the situation. 
Thus, public and private sector workers are not going to work 
today. A curfew was imposed from 1800 to 0600 on 5 January. 
The aim of the attack was reportedly to surround the Inter-Arms 
Regiment camp, the residence of President Eyadema, who was not 
there at the time. 
  It all began around 1830 GMT when gunshots from automatic 
weapons punctuated by explosions were heard for two hours at 
various areas in Lome, especially near the military camp. The 
security forces' reaction enabled them to kill seven of the 
attackers. Some of them allegedly managed to flee to Ghana, 
from where they reportedly came. An active search has been 
mounted for the others. It must be noted that the attack 
occurred just a few hours after the arrival of the French 
military observers in Lome and had virtually the same 
characteristics as that of 25 March 1993, during which 23 people 
died, including four senior officers. [end recording] 
  Mr. (Jean-Pierre Fabre), spokesman for the Union of Forces 
of 
Change [UFC] -- Mr. Gilchrist Olympio's party -- has given his 
reaction. He is refuting allegations that the 5 January attack 
on the Inter-Arms Regiment camp was the opposition's doing. He 
spoke to Raphael Mbadinga a few minutes ago. 
  [Begin recording] [(Fabre)] Last night a reporter alleged 
that the attack was from the opposition wing which refused to 
take part in the parliamentary elections. Of course, I strongly 
protest these unfounded statements. The UFC has always said 
that conditions of security and fairness have not been met for 
holding parliamentary elections. In our view, the minimum 
requirements we laid down have not been met; therefore, we said 
that if they were not met we would not take part in the 
elections. I think the facts confirm our analysis that there 
has been a recurrence of violence in Lome, which began around 
1830 on 5 January. Shots are still being fired now. 
  [Mbadinga] No, no it ended at 2130.... 
  [(Fabre), interrupting] No, no, I live in a suburb near the 
Aflao border and at 0600 this morning there were still shots. 
  [Mbadinga] You say that the opposition has nothing to do 
with this violence. Does the opposition suspect there is a lead 
on that? 
  [(Fabre)] I would not like to comment on that, but I am 
inclined to think there is a mutiny at the military camp. I am 
inclined to favor that theory. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Francis Ahouadi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Lome, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Unidentified gunmen tried 
to assassinate Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema before a 
shootout left 12 dead at the army camp here where he lives, 
sources close to him said Thursday as further gunfire could be 
heard. A group of men shot at the the West African leader's 
armoured Mercedes car Wednesday with automatic weapons and a 
rocket-launcher, but Eyadema was not in the vehicle at the time, 
the sources said. His chauffeur, driving the car at a time when 
the president often returns to his official residence in the 
camp, was unhurt, they added. 
  Shots and explosions could be heard Thursday morning from 
the 
western parts of Lome close to the border with Ghana, but 
residents had begun to venture out on to the streets by 11:00 
A.M. (1100 GMT). 
  In a shoot-out that followed the assassination bid, 10 of 
the 
assailants and two soldiers were killed, officials said. 
  Authorities have not fully identified the attackers, 
referring to them only as "armed elements," but charged that 
they came from Ghana, in what observers took to be an accusation 
targetting exiled opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio. Olympio 
was not in the Ghanaian capital Accra on Wednesday and told AFP 
from London that he knew nothing about the operation. In May 
1992, Olympio's own car was ambushed in an attack widely 
attributed to the armed forces loyal to General Eyadema, which 
left him badly wounded and killed another opposition leader. 
  Mopping-up operations continued Thursday as the army and 
police sought members of the group said to be hiding here after 
trying to "encircle the camp and close in on the people inside," 
according to an official statement. 
  Eyadema and Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh were at Eyadema's 
private home less than two kilometers (a mile) from the camp. 
The president "personally directed the counterattack" from his 
home, an informed source said. [passage omitted] 
  Opposition leaders reached by AFP refused to comment on the 
attack, saying they had inadequate information. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Lome 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Togolese Government 
announced in Lome today that legislative elections have been 
postponed for two weeks. They are now slated for 6 and 20 
February. 
  A government communique stated that this decision was made 
as 
a result of the "delays observed in carrying out some material 
tasks, mainly the personalization and distribution of voters' 
cards." The government also stated that "it took into account 
French and German electoral experts' views." 
  The text of the communique stressed that this postponement 
illustrates the "concern" of the head of state, General 
Gnassingbe Eyadema, and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh "to 
help these elections take place under better conditions." 
  This revision of the electoral timetable is in response, 
observers note, to the wishes of the moderate opposition, who 
were of the view that the initially fixed dates of 23 January 
and 6 February would be "technically" impossible to meet, as 
they would jeopardize the validity of the poll.

  [Text] A communique issued by the Defense Department today 
documented 20 cease-fire violations by rebels between 1 December 
and midnight of 31 December when the month-long cease-fire 
announced by head of state Captain Valentine Strasser expired. 
  According to the communique quoted by SLENA [SIERRA LEONE 
NEWS AGENCY], 14 areas were attacked for the first time; three 
others for the second time; two for the third time, and one -- 
Koindu -- for the fourth time. The longest battle during the 
cease-fire period occurred in Koindu, which lasted six hours on 
the 12th of December, resulting in the death of seven rebels and 
the capture of six others and 15 antitank mines. 
  In the month-long period six soldiers died in action, 40 
[were] wounded, and 20 [were] missing in action. According to 
the communique, 120 rebels were killed apart from a five-hour 
battle at Laoma on December 27th in which many rebels perished. 
Twelve others were captured in the month-long cease-fire with a 
total of 64 fighting hours. 
  The first violation of the cease-fire was on the 1st of 
December at Bandajuma in which eight rebels were killed, while 
the last (?shootout) before the end of the cease-fire was a 
five-hour battle at Ngorama (Tonkia) on the 21st of December 
when two lieutenants were wounded in action and three rebels 
killed. 
  Meanwhile, government troops yesterday repelled a one-hour 
rebel attack on Koindu, killing three rebels and capturing a 
number of arms and ammunitions including AK-47 rifles, Barrett 
guns, and grenades. According to the military assistant, 
Department of Defense, Captain Amadu Koromah, the attack on 
Koindu was the fifth.

  [Text] A bloodbath has occurred in northern Cameroon. Arab 
Shuwas and Kotokos are once again at loggerheads. According to 
various estimates, the death toll runs from 20 to 50. Jean Mater 
Ndi has more details. 
  [Begin Ndi recording] Between 23 and 24 December, a Kotoko 
was killed by an Arab Shuwa in the Makere District in the 
extreme north of the country. In retaliation, Kotokos decided 
to exact revenge on the night of 25 December; they went from 
mere words to action. The Arab Shuwa village of Sulfa was 
attacked and the two communities are now fighting with cold 
steel weapons, arrows, and rifles. Several people were killed 
or seriously wounded on both sides. As is usually the case in 
this region, the Arab Shuwa reacted swiftly. The day after the 
attack, 26 December, they attacked all Kotoko villages around 
the (Ndjamonou) District. This is the second day of terribly 
violent clashes between Arab Shuwa and Kotoko with some sources 
stating 20 dead and seriously wounded, while sources close to 
official circles say the death may be as high as 50. 
  Last year, clashes took place between the two communities 
and 
led to scores of dead and injured. [end recording]

  [Text] The peace talks between the government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
should have resumed in Lusaka this afternoon after they were 
interrupted on 24 December. The government negotiating team and 
the group of observers in the peace process are already present 
in the Zambian capital on the date set for the resumption of 
talks -- 5 January. There is no confirmation of the presence in 
Lusaka of the UNITA negotiating team, however. Faustino Muteka 
from the government delegation who left for Lusaka yesterday, 
accompanied by his colleagues, said on departure that the 
government delegation has powers to negotiate everything. 
  UN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye has concluded 
his visits to some African countries and left for the Zambian 
capital today. Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon, 
and Zaire are the countries whose presidents were contacted by 
Alioune Blondin Beye during the break in the peace talks. 
Before leaving for Lusaka, Alioune Blondin Beye gave assurances 
that the peace talks would begin this afternoon. Alioune 
Blondin Beye focused his statements, however, on contacts he 
held in the countries mentioned above. 
  [Begin Beye recording] The objective was as usual aimed at 
making use of the exceptional advantages that these countries 
possess. As you know, the delegations from the government and 
UNITA are already in Lusaka. I am very happy with this 
situation because the news media organs gave other reasons for 
the break in the peace talks. Fortunately, the government and 
UNITA acted differently. I have, therefore, held contacts with 
the heads of state of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, 
Gabon, and Zaire. There were two objectives for these visits -- 
first to brief them on [words indistinct] support for the peace 
talks. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Very early in the morning, street barricades 
were set up by elements who have not yet been officially 
identified. These barricades had the effect of paralyzing 
activity in the city. In some suburbs the barricades were 
removed by gendarmes, but in others the situation remains tense. 
  UPRONA [Union for National Progress] president, Nicholas 
Mayugi, in a declaration he has just issued, expressed his lack 
of solidarity with the organizers of these operations. Here he 
is: 
  [Begin Mayugi recording] The executive bureau of the UPRONA 
Party and its parliamentary team have just learned from the 
radio and that barricades were set up on some roads in Bujumbura 
on the morning of 6 January for the purpose of stopping workers 
from going to the various service districts. We have also 
learned that writings have been distributed on behalf of a 
coalition of opposition parties. 
  The UPRONA executive bureau and the UPRONA parliamentary 
team 
inform national and international opinion that the sabotage 
actions and the organization of this Operation Ghost Town, which 
seems to be the objective [as heard], have been decided and 
implemented without the knowledge of the leadership of UPRONA. 
That is why UPRONA's executive bureau and the parliamentary 
team express their total lack of solidarity with all the 
perpetrators of these deplorable acts which today are stopping 
people from going to work, going to see their doctors and 
honoring their commitments. [passage omitted] 
  We make a strong call to all our militants and the entire 
Burundi people to refuse any call for disorder, indiscipline, 
violation of the law, violence or subversion. We call for 
peace, dialogue, and discussionss, in order that the task of 
re-establishing peace and carrying out reconstruction will 
become easier. We call upon those of our militants who could be 
lost to heed our call for peace and discipline, and to cease 
sowing divisions, as hatred and chaos lead only to grief, 
disintegration and self destruction. All party members who hear 
our call should mobilize themselves for unity, peace, and work 
and keep away those who want to mislead them, acting in unison, 
for the restoration of peace in unity and nonviolence. Thank 
you. [end recording]

  [Text] Last night some roads in Bujumbura were barricaded. 
Major Safari, in charge of security in Bujumbura, gives us the 
details. He is interviewed by our colleague, (Gregoire 
Nijimbere). 
  [Begin recording] [Safari] We do not yet know why barricades 
were set up in Bujumbra. At around 0300 our security forces 
discovered that barricades had been erected on the following 
axes: National Road No. 1, Boulevard 28 November, in Nyakabiga 
and on University Avenue. Security forces have already removed 
these barricades. 
  [(Nijimbere)] Do we know who did this? 
  [Safari] We still do not know who erected the barricades. 
But we believe that it was done because of rumors which were 
circulating last night. But we have not yet proved it. 
[sentence as heard] A rumor has been circulating which says 
that Bujumbra would become a ghost town, and that some elements 
-- not yet identified -- would stop civil servants from going to 
work. 
  [(Nijimbere)] So, currently everything is back to normal? 
  [Safari] We have removed all the barricades and we invite 
the population of Bujumbura to carry out their usual duties.

  [Excerpts] Groups of youths erected roadblocks on main 
roads in various residential areas of Bujumbura on the night of 
5 to 6 January. These troublemakers are mainly secondary school 
and university students. It clearly appears that this move, 
which was an attempt to block all the socioeconomic activities 
of the capital, was organized and backed by political 
organizations referred to as the opposition partnership, which 
made subversive remarks by calling upon their militants to block 
all the initiatives of the government during a public conference 
organized on the afternoon of 5 January. [passage omitted]

youth: PIT, in collaboration with the country's gallant forces, 
strongly condemns the 21 October coup and the massacre of people 
that ensued. [passage omitted] PIT permanently seeks the 
welfare of workers and dissociates itself from those who are

among people in the countryside. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Trouble on the Cameroon-Nigeria border is pretty 
endemic. Also last week, there were reports of Cameroon 
gendarmes crossing into Nigeria and raiding villages. Now the 
Cameroon Foreign Ministry says about 500 Nigerian soldiers have 
landed on two islands in the Gulf of Guinea and have been 
occupying them since Monday [3 January]. The two Islands, 
Diamond and Jabane Islands, are officially Cameroonian 
territory. On the line to Yaounde, Herbert Saleh asked 
Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, Francis Nkwain, what he 
thought the Nigerian soldiers were up to: 
  [Begin recording] [Nkwain] You know that we have a very long 
border with Nigeria, from Lake Chad to the Atlantic. But this 
area which is close to the sea has been giving some problems for 
obvious reasons. It is a fishing ground and also beneath the 
water there we have a little bit of petrol. Things like that 
might be exciting the people. So we do not know because we have 
been discussing all these. So what we did was to register our 
protest in the normal way and in the spirit of good 
neighborliness. 
  [Saleh] You said you registered your protest. What have the 
Nigerians done? Have they responded? 
  [Nkwain] No, that is what I am saying that we registered our 
protest the day before yesterday by issuing the usual note to 
the Nigerian ambassador and he sent it home. And the reaction 
to it is that the foreign minister of Nigeria accompanied by the 
minister of industry are to arrive today with a message from 
President Abacha to President Biya. 
  [Saleh] So they are coming to resolve the issue? 
  [Nkwain] I think so. 
  [Saleh] So what can you tell us about the two islands which 
you say are occupied now by the Nigerian troops. Who lives 
there? 
  [Nkwain] The two Islands concerned are Jabane. One is 
called Jabane and the other one is called Diamond. They are 
islands on which some fishermen live but the fishermen are of 
the Ibidip. That is they are of Nigerian origin. They have 
always lived there. You know that this area is part of Alaja 
area that was southern Cameroon. And that is before our 
independence and it was treated as Nigeria and so anybody could 
live anywhere. But after the new maps were drawn, the people 
continued to live where they were living. And we in Cameroon are 
not opposed to their living there. As long as they recognize 
that they are living on Cameroon grounds, they can go on doing 
whatever they were doing and they will be doing it right into 
the future, no problem. But as long as they know that the law 
which operates there is Cameroon law. Now and again some of 
these actions come up because of pressure from them that they 
want to be Nigerians and that they don't want to obey our own 
local laws. 
  [Saleh] I understand that Cameroon has sent troops to the 
island. Is that correct? 
  [Nkwain] No, it is not a question of sending troops to the 
island. You cannot hear that there is a strange presence on 
your territory and just leave it. So obviously, the troops 
which supervise the area will make adequate movements to contain 
the situation but I do not think that there has been direct 
confrontation so far. 
  [Saleh] Do you have any idea what the Nigerians might be 
doing there now. 
  [Nkwain] We cannot... [pauses] I cannot say I have any idea. 
The report only said that they were landing by ship and by 
helicopter. It could be part of an exercise -- a training 
exercise. It could be anything. It could also be an act of war. 
It could be an act of occupation. But all these, I think, will 
only be clearer when we the two sides have examined the 
facts.[end recording]

  [Text] Yaounde, 7 Jan (AFP) -- The occupation of two 
Cameroonian islands in the Gulf of Guinea by Nigerian troops is 
considered by Cameroon "for the moment, as going beyond the 
boundary limits and not as a hostile gesture," sources close to 
the government disclosed today in Yaounde. 
  According to evidence emanating from Southwest Province, the 
occupation since 3 January of the two islands by 500 Nigerian 
troops reportedly followed an incident in that region between 
Cameroonian gendarmes and Nigerian fishermen. 
  Well-informed sources reported that there were Cameroonian 
troop movements toward Diamant and Jabane islands while two 
vessels of the Cameroonian Navy patrolled the area. 
  Without creating undue sensation about the incident, 
Cameroon 
has taken the situation seriously, according to sources close to 
the government. However, the Cameroonian authorities had still 
not reacted officially to the occupation of the two islands by 
this morning. 
  The arrival in Yaounde on the afternoon of 6 January of 
Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe and Commerce 
Minister Melford Okilo has also not been officially announced. 
The two Nigerian officials are scheduled to be received by 
President Paul Biya.

<F P=106> [By Joseph Gouala] </F>
  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 7 (AFP) -- The Congolese Army is 
currently grappling with a dangerous internal split, as officers 
have begun to take sides in the bloody political struggle 
between supporters of the president and an opposition coalition. 
A military source has warned that the 20,000-man Army is 
undergoing a crisis of authority. 
  President Pascal Lissouba late Wednesday [5 January] 
announced plans to recruit 2,000 additional men for the security 
forces, of whom 1,000 would be assigned to the Army. The goal 
of the campaign is to "revitalize" the Armed Forces, according 
to Prime Minister Jacques Yoachim Yhombi Opango, who noted that 
the last time new blood was injected into the Army through a 
recruiting drive was in 1983. But Opango said the government 
also wanted to ensure that the future Army and police force 
would reflect national diversity. The recruiting effort will 
therefore be undertaken in each of Congo's 47 districts. 
  The prime minister, himself a general, appealed for "more 
discipline within the public forces" and insisted that the Army 
"remain apolitical but subject to civilian authority." 
  At least 95 people have died since mid-December in southern 
Brazzaville in confrontations between partisans of Lissouba and 
his opponents. A military source acknowledged that officers 
were backing different militias in the clashes. 
  The Army commander, General Claude Emmanuel Eta-Oka, who 
recently toured Army barracks, suggested in a television 
interview that soldiers had taken "individual" decisions to back 
parties to the ethnic violence. "In a country that was heavily 
politicized under a one-party regime and where ethnic rivalries 
were suppressed, soldiers can't escape the influence of 
political bipolarization," explained one officer. For Defense 
Minister Raymond Damase N'gollo, troops must be accorded better 
living and working conditions to withstand such influences. 
  Ethnic frictions weighing on the Army have meant that 
"orders 
from the high military command are not respected in the conflict 
zones, where private militias are defying the regular Army," 
notably through "illegal identity controls," said a Western 
diplomat, who said he was pessimistic on the outcome of the 
current crisis. 
  A senior officer with close ties to Lissouba disclosed that 
regular security forces appeared to have lost control of the 
internal situation despite their reliance on heavy weapons to 
stamp out the activities of the private militias. 
  Oppostion supporters have denounced the use of such weaponry 
and stressed that the Congolese people are determined to carry 
on with their campaign for democracy in the face of the most 
sophisticated arms.

  [Text] Libreville, 5 Jan (AFP) -- Arturo Avello, Spanish 
ambassador to Equatorial Guinea, has said that cooperation 
between Madrid and Malabo "will not be suspended but 
restructured," the Equatorial Guinean radio monitored in 
Libreville reported. 
  The Spanish Government decided in December to reduce its aid 
to Equatorial Guinea by half and cancel all its assistance 
programs to the official bodies, notably aid to the radio and 
television and training scholarships to the Armed Forces 
following the expulsion of Diego Sanchez Bustamante, Spanish 
consul general in Bata, the country's second most important 
city. Mr. Bustamante was accused by the Equatorial Guinean 
authorities of "interfering in the country's internal affairs." 
  After being recalled for consultations, the ambassador 
returned to Malabo on 1 January with a message from his 
government to President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. The contents of 
the message were not revealed, the radio explained. 
  Speaking before the Equatorial Guinean press after an 
audience with the head of state, the Spanish diplomat stressed 
that his country wants to maintain relations with Equatorial 
Guinea but that the latter must consider Spain's stand on the 
security of its citizens in the country, human rights, and the 
democratic process in Equatorial Guinea.

  [Text] Our guest this evening is the Gabonese opposition 
figure, Max-Anicet Koumba. After 13 years of exile in France he 
has now decided to return to Gabon. Assane Diop met Max-Anicet 
Koumba, who is the leader of MORENA [Movement for National 
Recovery] in exile, and asked him to react to the multiparty 
presidential election of 5 December, which ended in the 
re-election of President Bongo. Here is Max-Anicet Koumba: 
  [Begin recording] [Koumba] When one looks at the preparation 
for and the holding of the presidential election in Gabon, one 
has the impression that for several years now, and, more 
precisely, since 1990, the opposition has been content with 
playing a walk-on part within the institutions that were 
entrusted with preparing this election. Today, since the 
presidential election has taken place and the results are out, 
this is no longer a simulation, a polling operation, where one 
says so and so has come first, the first choice of the people, 
and such and such has come second. I believe that the verdict 
of the ballot box is out, it is known, the president of the 
Republic has been elected democratically in our country for 
once. Now it is for the losers, the unhappy rival candidates 
for presidential election, to acknowledge the result of this 
election. The technical part of the organization of the election 
was certainly not without imperfection, but basically the 
election took place and if there are any questions, they must be 
generalized. In other words, there must be an effort to check 
exhaustively the results of all the candidates, not just of a 
single candidate, but of all the candidates. 
  [Diop] What do you think of President Bongo's proposal to 
involve all of the Gabonese political officials who so wish it 
in the running of the country? 
  [Koumba] That is pointless. That is pointless in a democracy 
-- we are not obliged to operate and form a national unity 
government as if this was still the era of the single party. A 
president of the Republic has been elected. If he is confident 
in his election, then let him shoulder his responsibilities. I 
do not believe that it is useful to call on everyone to form a 
single party once again in the midst of democracy. If there is 
a majority, it is for this majority to shoulder its 
responsibilities and for the opposition to shoulder its own. 
  [Diop] While honoring the law-based state? 
  [Koumba] Yes, absolutely. 
  [Diop] So, what do you think about the forming of a parallel 
government and of this parallel presidency taken on by Father 
Mba Abessole ? 
  [Koumba] I would not venture even to comment on this 
initiative. I know quite simply that it is an imitation of the 
Gabonese Government in exile, which I myself had created here, 
of which I was the prime minister, the head of government. In 
an electoral stage, in the context of a democracy, this 
initiative seems to me to be stupid. It is politically stupid 
and legally reprehensible. 
  [Diop] After your return to Gabon, where are you going to 
position yourself now within the political sphere? Where will 
you stand first of all with regard to the government of 
President Bongo? 
  [Koumba] Before saying where I will position myself, I am 
going to begin by carrying out a tour of talks, because the 
problem today is clarifying the political situation in our 
country. [end recording]

  [Text] Durban Jan 7 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi met the chairman of the American 
foreign affairs sub-committee Harry Johnston and his delegation 
in Ulundi on Friday morning where he impressed upon them the 
need for a federal settlement in South Africa. In a memo to the 
delegation Mr Buthelezi said "the political power bases of 
minorities must be constitutionally entrenched by means of a 
federal system". 
  Otherwise, he said, "the successful majority will destroy 
the 
political power bases of minorities, thereby preventing forever 
that a minority could become a majority in the future". 
  Mr Buthelezi said he was meeting the Americans at a time 
when 
"some of the most important decisions in the history of the IFP" 
would be taken. He was referring to the party's Central 
Committee meeting which got underway after he received the 
Americans on Friday morning. 
  Mr Buthelezi defended the IFP's stance towards negotiations 
in South Africa, telling the Americans that "no concessions have 
been made to accommodate the Freedom Alliance or the IFP". He 
alleged that during talks his party's inputs were "constantly 
ignored", demands "sidelined", and concerns "silenced". 
"Manipulation and arrogance characterised the process leaving no 
space for true negotiations with us." 
  Mr Buthelezi added that during negotiations "we dramatically 
reduced our original demands without being met by corresponding 
efforts from our counterparts."

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] in Transkei, 
which is regarded as a power base for the organization, is 
reportedly in tatters and almost all its top leaders have been 
ousted in a bid to stem the crisis. Andrew Trench has details: 
  ANC Transkei media officer Nat Serache confirms the contents 
of a scathingly critical ANC report which reveals the 
organization in the homeland is in a mess. The report is of a 
visit to Transkei by ANC Deputy Secretary General Jacob in 
September and October 1993. The report reveals an ANC mired by 
organizational ineptitude, a lack of administration, and 
describes a leadership fraught with rival factions. The report 
warns that if the ANC's problems in Transkei are not sorted out, 
it could face a disaster in the elections. Serache also confirms 
that last month drastic action was taken to solve the problems. 
At the organization's regional congress all but one of the top 
officials were ousted by delegates. Serache says the new 
leaders are trying to pull the ANC back on track, but he 
concedes they have their work cut out for them.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has announced a 
campaign to rebuild the social fabric in violence torn East Rand 
townships. Announcing the campaign at a Johannesburg media 
conference, ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
Regional Executive Committee member Jessie Duarte said the aim 
of the campaign is to build peace consciousness in the area. 
She said the peace plan is a call from all South Africans for 
help to build the social fabric in the area. Organizations 
across the political spectrum have been invited to a meeting on 
15 January. This is when a working group will lay the 
foundation for the campaign. 
  Duarte says among other plans, the ANC has proposed that 
people from outside the East Rand, irrespective of political 
affiliation and race, spend time and talk to residents in 
violence plagued areas. She says the campaign was initiated by 
the ANC, but it is for all South Africa who need to hold a free 
and fair election and a peaceful transition.

making it difficult to establish peace and stability on the East

<F P=106> [Interview with African National Congress spokesperson Carl </F>
Niehaus by SABC reporter Rodney Trudgeon on the "Radio Today" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Trudgeon] The ANC [African National Congress] has 
announced various prominent members of society to represent the 
organization in the April elections. However, many of these 
candidates, including a former Springok rugby player, have not 
yet accepted their nominations. On the line now, we have ANC 
spokesman Carl Niehaus. Mr. Niehous, good morning. How 
predictable are these nominations? Were most of them expected? 
  [Niehaus] Good morning. Actually, the nominations have been 
a very wide group of people that all the different Mass 
Democratic Movement organizations in South Africa have come 
forward with. So one would get a much wider net than just 
simply members of the ANC, and I suppose in that context some of 
the names that have been proposed may be surprising to members 
of the media. 
  [Trudgeon] How significant is it that a lot of these pople 
have not yet accepted their nominations? 
  [Niehaus] Well, I think that indicates that the lists that 
have now become public are only provisional lists; that one 
cannot at this stage say that any particular person is yet going 
to stand as a candidate for the ANC, or is in fact going to be 
elected to Parliament. All of that depends on whether those 
candidates are prepared to accept their nominations, and then of 
course there are still provincial lists conferences this coming 
weekend, where the 14 different regions of the ANC's nominations 
will be consolidated into the 9 provinces, and then of course 
there will be a national list conference on 15 January, where 
the final lists will be consolidated, and they will be made 
public on 18 January. So only on 18 January will we be able to 
present to South Africa a final list of candidates which will 
stand for the ANC and would have actually accepted their 
nominations. 
  [Trudgeon] Now a feature of the nomination list is, quite a 
few media and sports personalities. I'm thinking of people like 
Bruce Fordyce, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, Jacqui Mofekeng, the Miss 
South Africa. This aspect of the list has in fact been 
criticized, for example, by the National Party. 
  [Niehaus] Well, you know, the National Party can express 
their criticism, but the fact of the matter is that there are 
many people, prominent persons in South African society, who 
associate themselves far more with the ideals of nonracialism 
and democracy, as the ANC has fought for it through all the 
decades, and one will probably find that some of these prominent 
personalities will accept nomination. That is also not anything 
new. Throughout the world, for example in the United States, 
there have been, from time to time, members of the cultural 
community, actors, etcetera, who have shown their support for a 
particular political organization, because they share those 
ideals. But I must emphasize that many of the persons who are 
mentioned there -- sportsmen, actors, etcetera -- have not yet 
been approached, and their nominations still have to be checked 
with them, and only after they have made a decision can one 
actually say that they have accepted it, and that they are 
prepared to associate themselves, on that particular level, with 
the ANC. 
  [Trudgeon] Perhaps one of the most important omissions, 
which 
I notice newspapers and the media have taken up in general, is 
that Winnie Mandela is absent from both lists. Is there any 
significance in that? 
  [Niehaus] Well, I don't think one should read too much 
significance in it. The lists that you have received now are a 
list for the provisional parliament candidatures of the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and also the PWV 
region's nominations for the National Assembly. But there is 
also a general National Assembly list which has been voted on, 
but that counting has not been finished yet, and therefore it 
has not been made public, and on that list, as one of the 
nominees, Mrs. Mandela did appear. So her name can still 
appear, depending on how the voting went on the national list 
for the National Assembly. 
  [Trudgeon] There has also apparently been sweeping support 
for Peter Mokaba, the youth leader. 
  [Niehaus] Yes. That is the situation, that there has been 
strong support for Mr. Mobkaba. 
  [Trudgeon] Mr. Niehaus, one of the criticisms leveled at 
your 
list came from Wits [Witwatersrand University] political analyst 
Professor Tom Lodge, who mentioned that the list is perhaps a 
little short of business talent. Now I know you have people 
like Sam Motsuenyane being nominated. How do you feel about the 
lack of business talent? 
  [Niehaus] Well, I don't think there is a lack of business 
talent. Again, it is unfortunate that categorical statements 
about these lists are being made at a stage when, really, only 
the list of the PWV region is now public. There are namy, many 
other provinces and regions that have made nominations, and 
there are also a considerable number of busines people on the 
national list for the National Assembly. So I would caution 
that analysts must wait until the final list comes out, before 
they can make those kinds of deductions. 
  [Trudgeon] It's also significant that some of the people who 
have been nominated are not really standing, because they 
belong, now, to other organizations. I'm thinking of Rev. Frank 
Chikane, and also Mr. Zwelakhi Sisulu, who has been appointed 
Mr. Harmse's assistant here at the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation]. 
  [Niehaus] Well, what has happened is that we left the 
nomination process open, so that anyone could be nominated, and 
then we leave it up to those particular individuals, in 
consultation with the ANC, to accept their nominations or to 
decline. Rev. Chikane has already indicated that he declines 
because he is not eligible to stand for any political 
organization, because of his position as a member of the 
Independent Electoral Commission. I believe the same will 
account for Mr. Sisulu, who is now the deputy to Mr. Harmse, or 
at least the nominated deputy to Mr. Harmse at the SABC.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 6 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] on 
Thursday condemned the African National Congress' [ANC] 
appointment of people with criminal records as election 
candidates -- referring specifically to Winnie Mandela and 
Robert McBride. "Voters must realise that in this election they 
do not vote for one candidate, but for a list of candidates," 
the NP said in a statement. 
  It mentioned that McBride, sentenced to death three times 
for 
planting a bomb which killed three and injured scores in a 
Durban pub in 1986, was pardoned along with "Wit Wolf" Barend 
Strydom who killed seven blacks when he randomly opened fire on 
them in Pretoria in 1988. 
  The NP added that the accommodation of radicals such as ANC 
Youth League President Peter Mokaba so high on ANC election 
lists was evidence of the stranglehold the South African 
Communist Party had on the ANC.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 6 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] negotiator Patricia de Lille has denied press reports 
quoting her as stating that the PAC was willing to give up its 
armed struggle. In a statement on Thursday, she said the 
reports in the SOWETAN and NATAL MERCURY on Wednesday were based 
on an incorrect interpretation of comments she had made at a 
news conference on Tuesday. 
  Mrs. de Lille had said the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian 
Peoples Liberation Army, had temporarily suspended its armed 
struggle pending negotiations with the government and South 
African Defence Force on a mutual cessation of hostilities. She 
said further meetings to discuss the ending of hostilities could 
be held within the next two weeks.

  [Text] A 13-year-old PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] member 
has been shot dead and six others including a six-year-old child 
have been wounded in clashes between police and a group of PAC 
members in Guguletu in the Cape Peninsula a short while ago. 
The trouble flared after police arrived at a PAC meeting in the 
township and took away nine youths for questioning in connection 
with the Heidelberg tavern attack. PAC executive member 
Patricia de Lille and other senior PAC officials are locked in 
talks with high-ranking policemen to discuss the situation, a 
situation which is said to be extremely tense.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 7 SAPA -- Allegations that police went 
to a Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] meeting in Gugulethu on 
Thursday night with the sole purpose of breaking it up was 
devoid of all truth, western Cape police liaison chief Col 
Raymond Dowd said on Friday. A 13-year-old boy was reportedly 
shot dead when violence erupted after police rounded up nine men 
aged between 17 and 23 and put them in a police vehicle. 
  Col Dowd said after the men were loaded in the police van 
certain sections of the community outside the Luyolo community 
centre, where the PAC meeting took place, began stoning the 
police and police were forced to fire rubber bullets. The men 
were taken to the Bellville South police station where they were 
questioned about the Heidelberg Tavern attack and other 
incidents. They were released soon afterwards. 
  "We wish to emphasise that the suspects (the nine men) who 
were removed from the centre were removed with the cooperation 
of the organisers of the meeting after Col Leonard Knipe, who 
headed the operation, spoke to them," Col Dowd said. "We find it 
strange that the organisers did not calm the crowd that attacked 
the police." 
  He said incidents of this nature would not occur if the 
police were able to use normal policing methods. "Unfortunately 
we have to enter these areas armed and accompanied by members of 
the Internal Stability Unit solely because police are always 
attacked by stonethrowers carried out [as published] by a small 
section of the community," Col Dowd said. 
  Col Dowd, who felt the community at large should protect the 
police, confirmed that five people were being detained in 
connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack. 
  The regional organiser of the PAC in the western Cape, Mr 
Michael Siyolo, and the movement's regional chairman, Mr Theo 
Mabusela, were detained on Monday. 
  Earlier this week two "confirmed" members of APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army] were detained in Elliott, near the 
Transkei border, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel announced 
on Thursday. 
  Col Dowd said a fifth man, believed to be Mr Richard Dala, a 
former executive member of the PAC, was detained in Khayelitsha 
on Thursday. he five men were all being held in terms of Section 
29 of the Internal Security Act, Col Dowd said.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 7 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] is investigating charges against police following Thursday 
night's raid on a PAC election meeting in which a 13-year-old 
boy was shot dead and five others injured. At a news conference 
on Friday, PAC Regional Executive Committee members said the 
movement's lawyers would also assist relatives of Siphiwo Sam to 
lay a murder charge against police following an autopsy on the 
dead boy. 
  The organisation on Friday sought a meeting with Deputy 
Regional Police Commissioner Maj-Gen Nick Snyman to discuss the 
police raid. 
  Although it has not lodged a complaint with the Transitional 
Executive Council, the PAC called on the Independent Electoral 
Commission and other transitional structures to "prove that they 
have teeth" and act firmly against the security forces. 
  Siphiwo, a standard six pupil at Langa comprehensive school, 
was killed when violence erupted outside the Luyolo community 
centre in Gugulethu after police raided a PAC meeting to arrest 
suspects allegedly linked to last week's Heidelberg Tavern 
attack. Police claim they fired rubber bullets and bird shot 
after a crowd stoned them and tried to free nine young men from 
a police vehicle. 
  However, PAC officials described the police version as "a 
brutal lie" and said police had set dogs on PAC members and 
opened fire without warning when angry supporters protested 
against the arrests. 
  The police action was strongly condemned on Friday by 
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who said police appeared to 
have exceeded the bounds of a normal criminal investigation in 
order to harass the PAC. 
  PAC National Executive Committee member Patricia de Lille 
told journalists on Friday PAC leaders had appealed to police to 
postpone the arrests "until things calmed down". 
  However, a police team led by violent crime unit head Col 
Leonard Knipe had insisted on identifying the alleged suspects 
and removing them for questioning. "The meeting agreed that they 
could look around. We allowed them to carry out their duty, but 
we did not give them permission to remove anyone." 
  Mrs de Lille and other regional officials later accompanied 
the police to Bellville, where murder and robbery squad 
detectives released the men after questioning, fingerprinting 
and photographing them. She said the fact that all nine were 
subsequently released indicated that police had acted on false 
information supplied by informers. 
  "The PAC has always said the police are racist and brutal 
when dealing with black people. We wish they could show more 
efficiency to find the killers of more than 10,000 (black) 
african people who have died in South Africa in the past three 
years." 
  PAC Regional Secretary Bathembu Lugulwana said three men and 
a woman were still being treated for gunshot wounds in local 
hospitals. He confirmed that a third member of the PAC in the 
western Cape, Richard Dala, was detained by police on Thursday. 
Two other regional officials, Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo, 
are being held under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. 
  Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel also announced on 
Thursday that two "confirmed" members of the PAC's armed wing, 
the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA], had been arrested 
near Elliot in the north-eastern Cape. 
  Mr Lugulwana said police had refused to supply the names of 
the two men detained in Elliot to the PAC. "They could have 
picked up anyone and now they claim they are APLA," he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 6 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] on Thursday accused Law and Order Minister Hernus 
Kriel of "PAC bashing" and of "demonising" Transkei military 
leader Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa. PAC national organiser Maxwell 
Nemadzivhanani was reacting to reports that Mr Kriel had linked 
Transkei to the St James Church and Heidelberg Tavern massacres. 
  Mr Nemadzvhanani said in a statement the recent arrests of 
PAC western Cape leaders Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo, as 
well as attempts to link Transkei to Azanian Peoples Liberation 
Army [APLA] attacks on South Africa, were "part of the regime's 
strategy to target the PAC in those areas where it is strong". 
He accused "the same forces" for arresting PAC leaders and 
members in a "nation-wide swoop" in May 1993 and "killing 
children" in a raid on a house in Transkei in October last year. 
  "Following the Kenilworth church gun attack in July 1993 in 
Cape Town, the regime summarily arrested Vuyo Tekane, a PAC 
activist and schoolteacher allegedly for masterminding alleged 
APLA activities. "Tekane, according to police allegations then, 
was also linked to the 1922 APLA attack at a King William's Town 
golf club. Once again Tekane was released from detention without 
being charged for the alleged offences," Mr Nemadzivhanani said. 
  He said from all the cases or "so-called police 
breakthroughs" a clear picture had emerged of "camouflaged 
hostilities" against the PAC in the guise of maintaining law and 
order. "The PAC strongly condemns the detention of Comrades Theo 
Mabusela and Michael Siyolo as pure political gangsterism by the 
(President F W) de Klerk regime, designed to manipulate the 
transition and eventually the outcome of the election by 
'unlevelling' the playing field against the PAC and thus rigging 
the elections long before they start," Mr Nemadzvhanani said. 
  Mr Nemadzvhanani's statement was issued to SAPA shortly 
before Mr Kriel on Wednesday announced the arrest of two alleged 
APLA members in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack.

<F P=106> [Report by Abbey Makoe] </F>
  [Text] Commanders of various Self-defence Units [SDUs] in 
Katlehong on the East Rand were yesterday on the brink of 
resuming their "war" despite having agreed to a ceasefire on 
Tuesday. A source who yesterday morning attended the 
commanders' meeting, which was aimed at implementing the 
ceasefire, said it ended after only 30 minutes when commanders 
from three sections walked out in protest against a call for 
peace. 
  At the centre of the threatening move was mistrust, sources 
said. The mistrust element came into being when Hadebe Section's 
SDU members allegedly murdered the leader, "Commander Mbogani," 
after he was seen near Kwesine Hostel. A source said while most 
residents did not walk near the hostel for fear of their lives, 
Commander Mbogani at one stage boasted to his followers about 
having been in and out of the hostel unharmed. "Instead of 
being praised for bravery Commander Mbogani was accused of being 
an Inkatha Freedom Party spy. He was tried in a kangaroo court, 
found guilty and sentenced to death," a source who was present 
at the trial said. 
  Seventeen residents have since been killed in the subsequent 
internal clashes between the SDUs. The death toll since New 
Year's Day stood at 17 yesterday. However, ANC regional 
executive member Mr. Robert McBride told a news conference in 
Johannesburg that only four of the 17 deaths were as a result of 
the SDUs' internal fighting. 
  Some of the sections that disagreed on effecting the 
ceasefire came from the violence-plagued Mavimbela, Radebe, 
Ncala and Sali sections. A source who attended yesterday's 
meeting said: "Most of the commanders who walked out were 
against their boundaries being opened to people not living in 
them." 
  The source added: "That means if I live in Ncala I cannot 
enter Mavimbela, otherwise I will be killed." At the time of 
going to the press McBride was said to be "working very hard" 
trying to resolve the problem and avert the threat of renewed 
SDU clashes. 
  In another development, police pounced on the home of slain 
Monwabisi Mzukwa, alias "Commander Boja," in the early hours 
yesterday and arrested five suspected SDU members. "We seized 
one Walther PPK pistol, one magazine and three rounds of 
ammunition," said Warrant-Officer Michelle Erasmus. She said 
the five men were expected to appear in court soon on charges of 
illegal possession of weapons.

  [Text] A Political Rights Organization, the PRO, has been 
launched. The PRO, which was launched yesterday, will campaign 
for amnesty for rightwing political prisoners. In a statement, 
PRO Chairman (Avril Budd) said task groups have been formed to 
investigate the conviction of rightist political prisoners. The 
task groups will also investigate the reasons for the release of 
ANC [African National Congress] and PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] prisoners who were arrested for crimes such as the 
King William's Town Golf Club attack and the St. James Church 
massacre. 
  The statement says PRO intends to draw public attention to 
the plight of hundreds of policemen who were imprisoned and will 
also demand their immediate release. (Budd) says PRO wants the 
government to either charge or release right-wingers being held 
under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. It will also ask 
for right-wing prisoners to be removed from the Soweto Prison 
where (Budd) claims they are at the mercy of the ANC-alligned 
police union, Popcru [Police and Prison's Civil Rights Union].

  [Text] Blacks are twice as optimistic as whites about the 
year ahead. This has emerged from a Markinor Gallup poll which 
shows that 60 percent of blacks and only 31 percent of whites 
think conditions will improve in 1994. Optimism has improved 
markedly among blacks with 29 percent more than last year being 
positive about prospects. This is in sharp contrast to last 
year when blacks and whites were equally pessimistic about the 
future. Coloreds and Indians are only slightly less optimistic 
than blacks. Close on 60 percent of blacks and just over 40 
percent of coloreds feel that there will be fewer strikes this 
year. Forty percent of whites and 40 percent of Indians believe 
industrial strife will increase.

given a new government five years to implement a reconstruction 
and development program. COSATU says political freedom for 
workers in 1994 will mean a vote for democracy, a vote for jobs, 
a vote for peace and a vote for improved living conditions. 
However, these objectives will be achieved only through a 
concrete program which sets out clear priorities, targets and

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Law, Order Ministry's `Short Memory' -- Law and Order 
Ministry Spokesman Craig Kotze "was in full flight on the SDUs 
[self-defense units]," says a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 7 January. "The controversial ANC 
[African National Congress]-aligned self-defence units, he said, 
not only attacked the police, they attacked Inkatha and the 
public and now they were fighting among themselves. The ANC 
plans to try to restore order by holding an internal inquiry was 
just not good enough, he fulminated. Kotze has a short memory. 
On how many occasions have the police not done exactly the same 
when faced with problems?" 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  New Defense Force More Acceptable to More People -- "There 
can be no better demonstration of the distance South Africa has 
travelled towards its new beginning than the imminent creation 
of a new defence force," begins Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 7 January in a page 6 editorial. "It was often said 
most senior SADF [South African Defense Force] officers, unlike 
some of their SA [South African] Police counterparts, were 
always comfortable with the successive phases of National Party 
reforms. Events have shown this view to be correct. It seems 
fairly clear that the same applies to the ANC and its military 
wing." Whatever its potential shortcomings and excesses, the 
new defense force "promises to be infinitely more acceptable to 
the bulk of the population -- and therefore more effective -- 
than the organisation it is going to replace." 
<H5>  SOWETAN </H5>
  `People' Believe ANC To Take From Whites To Give to Them -- 
"The ANC is obviously aware that the millions of its supporters 
believe it is going to wave a magic wand and conjure up houses 
and jobs soon after the election result is announced," notes a 
page 6 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 7 
January. "A common belief among the `people' is that the ANC 
will take from whites and give to them. The ANC should tell the 
`people' that the coming elections are about forging a 
constituent assembly, a democratic body of elected 
representatives to draw up the final constitution and prepare 
South Africa for its first nonracial general election. This 
general election will come only after five years and during that 
time the country will need social and economic reconstruction. 
Therefore, the job of explaining this to the `people' lies not 
on Nelson Mandela's shoulders alone, as the case seems to be at 
the moment, but on the entire ANC leadership." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Peacekeeping Force `Prep School' for MK Recruits to NDF -- 
Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 7-13 
January 
in a page 14 editorial believes the ANC is directing its "real 
efforts and resources" at "finding agreement on the future 
makeup and command and control structures of the SADF, to be 
called the National Defense Force (NDF). Bearing out this are 
the decisions of the ANC and the government to send their senior 
commanders not to the Command Council of the Peacekeeping Force, 
but to the management body of the defence force, the Joint 
Command Council." The ANC "seems to have made concessions, 
sacrificing the short-term efficacy of the Peacekeeping Force 
for the long-term loyalty of the NDF." So the Peacekeeping 
Force "is essentially a sideshow, a prep school for MK's 
[Umkhonto we Sizwe -- ANC military wing] recruits to the NDF, 
and a flak catcher which will be responsible for the difficult 
task of policing during the pre-election period. It will ensure 
that the defence force emerges with its legitimacy more intact 
than if it stands in the frontline itself during the tense and 
virulently partisan weeks before the poll."

  [Text] The minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, 
today dismissed the report that Ghanaians were involved in an 
attack on the main Army camp in Lome. Speaking to the GHANA 
NEWS AGENCY in Accra, Dr. Asamoah said the Togolese authorities 
have no evidence to support the claim that the attackers came 
from Ghana. He said, however, that the government was 
monitoring the situation and would respond at the appropriate 
time. Dr. Asamoah, who is also the acting attorney general and 
minister of justice, recalled that the Togolese authorities 
leveled similar accusations against Ghana on the eve of the 
presidential election in Lome last August. 
  On the closure of the land border with Ghana by the Togolese 
authorities, the minister described it as unfortunate as it has 
caused hardship to people living on both sides. Dr. Asamoah 
hoped it would not be too long for the border to be reopened as 
provided for under the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West 
African States] Treaty.

  [Text] The President, Flight Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings, this 
morning, opened the second session of parliament at the 
International Conference Center in Accra. He reviewed the 
overall performance of the government over the past year and 
outlined its program for this year. President Rawlings touched 
on all aspects of national life. Tina Teoda attended the 
opening ceremony: 
  [Begin recording] [Teoda] President Rawlings said the past 
year saw some positive developments on the political front but 
wished that challenges relating to the constitutionality of 
certain government actions be confined to sober and principled 
issues. He said many of the issues raised in constitutional 
cases before the Supreme Court involved serious practical 
problems, not just for government but also for the public at 
large. President Rawlings said it would be ideal if the public 
would inform the police about meetings and demonstrations for 
the necessary precautionary measures to be taken. 
  [Rawlings] I would also wish that challenges relating to the 
constitutionality of certain government actions will be confined 
to sober and principled issues and not become what sometimes 
seems to be a legal or political thought. Mr. Speaker, Ladies 
and Gentlemen, many of the issues raised in constitutional cases 
before the Supreme Court involve serious practical problems not 
just for the government but also for the public at large. On 
the terms of one of these rulings, the police feel powerless to 
prevent gatherings likely to lead to violence such as those 
relating to stool disputes and can only intervene when trouble 
actually erupts. While a permit may not be required before 
public processions and demonstrations are held, we believe that 
it would be judicious to impose a duty on the public to inform 
the police in advance before such processions and demonstrations 
to enable them institute the necessary precautions and security 
measures. We shall examine the Supreme Court decision to see 
whether the necessary flexibility exists to enable us introduce 
a bill in this House to that effect for the sake of the public. 
  [Teoda] Touching on the recent court decision on celebrating 
the anniversary of the 31 December Revolution, President 
Rawlings says the government will respect the constitutional 
provision of the Supreme Court but cannot allow one arm to stage 
a coup d'etat against the other. 
  [Rawlings] The recent narrow majority decision of the 
Supreme Court about the celebration of 31 December Revolution 
also raises fundamental questions about the store of the Supreme 
Court's functions vis-a-vis the legislative powers of parliament 
and indeed the prerogative of the executive. The experience of 
constitutional democracy teaches us that nothing is gained from 
confrontationist or subversive attitudes from elements in any 
arm of government. Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen, we will 
respect the constitutional provision of the Supreme Court, but 
we cannot allow that almost government to stage what was a coup 
d'etat against the other government. And come to think of it, I 
thought the Constitution had proscribed coup d'etats in any 
form. In any case, it is true that the year 1994 will see these 
two arms of government complementing each other for the sake of 
our people. 
  [Teoda] The president said accountability is not a mere 
watchword and must reflect in the smallest actions of all. He 
said the country still has to contend with adverse external 
economic factors. He outlined the program for this year. 
  [Rawlings] The main thrust of our economic program for 1994 
will be to further accelerate rural and self urban development, 
employment generation to mount the program of vigorous 
diversification and promotion to build on the progress that has 
already been made, as well as to attack waste and malfeasance in 
public finance management and expenditure. As you all know, the 
auditor-general's report submitted to parliament last year 
revealed a very painful and unacceptable catalogue of waste, 
irresponsible resource management in several ministries, and 
malpractices in various departments and organizations. This 
will be unforgivable at any time and more so when our resources 
are stretched thinly to cover our many responsibilities to the 
people of this nation. The irregularities revealed by the audit 
will be followed up and appropriate action taken. Even more 
important, steps will be taken to prevent their recurrence in 
the future. The Ministry of Finance as well as all the heads of 
all sectors and organizations have been charged to strengthen 
measures to ensure effective financial management within all 
government bodies, including all otherwise independent bodies 
such as commissions, councils and boards, which depend on 
government funds. Accountability is not a mere watchword. It 
must reflect in the smallest actions of each one of us. It is 
not enough to be satisfied with our own personal integrity and 
good intentions if those working under our authority and 
supervision dissipate resources whether through laxity and 
carelessness, or with selfish intent. We have undertaken a 
review of the present structure of the government machinery with 
a view to enhancing efficiency and avoiding waste. Accordingly, 
the existing ministerial arrangements will be rationalized and 
function amalgamated where this would not affect the focus of 
the sectors concerned. 
  [Teoda] President Rawlings also examined the country's 
present and future roles in international affairs. He hinted 
that there would be a re-orientation of foreign service 
officers and ambassadors to be more effective in promoting the 
interests of the country. He commended [word indistinct] and 
urged parliament to continue working in the spirit of openness.

  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Jerry John 
Rawlings, today received the envoys from Zimbabwe and Burkina 
Faso at the Castle Osu. 
  The Zimbabwean minister of defense, Mr. Woven Enock Mahachi, 
who is the leader of the military team currently touring the 
country, delivered a special message from President Robert 
Mugabe to President Rawlings. Mr. Mahachi and his colleagues 
are assessing infrastructure and logistic facilities available 
in the country on which Zimbabwean troops will rely during the 
peace keeping duties in Liberia. He said their troops are ready 
but funds have not yet been made available and hoped when 
everything is set, the Zimbabwean troops will be able to cope 
with the situation. 
  President Rawlings said though the Liberian situation is an 
economic drain, with assistance it is manageable. He promised 
that the country will make available any information that will 
help the smooth deployment of troops. The command structure of 
the new UN force is also yet to be resolved. Zimbabwe, 
Tanzania, and Uganda were selected by the United Nations to join 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] troops in peacekeeping duties in Liberia. 
  A three-man delegation from Burkina Faso made up of the 
minister of commerce, industry, and mines, Mr. Zephirin Diabre, 
and the chief of staff at the president's office, Mr. Gilbert 
Diendere, also delivered a message from President Blaise 
Compaore to President Rawlings. The message contained an 
invitation to President Rawlings to attend the commissioning of 
a hydroelectric project in Burkina Faso.

  [Text] In Guinea the opposition continues to criticize the 
election of President Lansana Conte in the 19 December 
presidential election. His victory has been confirmed by the 
Supreme Court of Conakry. The opposition, which is determined 
to come together and begin consultations, says it is not 
surprised by President Conte's victory. Here is the opinion of 
Siradiou Diallo, chairman of the Party of Renewal and Progress 
[PRP], in an interview with Carmen Diop: 
  [Begin recording] [Diallo] Everybody can be surprised by 
this confirmation -- but not we of the PRP. Our party had for a 
very long time before the polling day known that everything had 
been set to proclaim the president elected right from the first 
round. That is why the opposition held a series of meetings to 
decide not to participate in the polls, which was going to be a 
real masquerade. The president could not have an absolute 
majority right from the first round; it is technically and 
practically impossible. However, he was declared the winner. We 
think this is a forced victory, and this result is far from the 
rules of democracy. It is rather thanks to his military force 
that he has been reelected. 
  [Diop] How do you plan to react to this? 
  [Diallo] Right now, we have asked our supporters and the 
whole party to remain calm for the moment -- not to indulge in 
an uncontrolled reaction. This a matter which should be studied 
in detail before embarking on a new course of action or 
strategy. But all this, in our opinion, should be done with the 
other opposition parties. [end recording] 
  The reaction from the committee of support for President 
Conte's action in France is that Guineans should put an end to 
postelection wrangling and get down to work. The challenge 
facing the country today is economic redress, as the chairman of 
this association explains to Carmen Diop: 
  [Begin recording of unidentified official] We shall continue 
to work for Lansana Conte and his actions, and we appeal to all 
opposition political parties and their outfits, after exhausting 
all institutional avenues for redress, to respect the verdict of 
the polls, so that Guineans can get to work, because we have no 
right to waste time. We have wasted time for 26 years, I think 
Guineans must roll up their sleeves and get to work -- by taking 
up the challenges of under development. [Words indistinct] many 
Guinean students are indignant concerning the insulting 
statements made by a representative from an obscure Guinean 
students association. The entire presidential support group 
wants to reaffirm that the 19 December 1993 elections were not a 
masquerade. [end recording]

  [Text] There have been bloody ethnic clashes in Guinea. 
They occurred in the town of Machinta near the Liberia border 
and involved Tomas and Koniankes. It is not the first time the 
two groups are being at each other's throats and a lot of people 
are reported dead in the latest bloodshed. From Conakry, Foday 
Fofana telexed this report: 
  A senior police officer told me this morning that he had 
received report that at least 30 people had already died in the 
ethnic clashes and many more had been wounded. He said that the 
situation in the town was explosive, but added that the area had 
been tense for the past six months and he had been expecting 
serious ethnic trouble in the town. The clashes have been 
between the Tomas and the Koniankes, who have been opposed to 
each other for a long time. The Koniankes had been mainly 
business people while the Tomas are mainly agriculturalists or 
civil servants. 
  While the government had said that the clashes are not 
political, there is speculation that politics could be the 
cause. The Tomas are in the main supporters of President 
Lansana Conte, while the Koniankes are known to be supporters of 
the opposition leader, Alpha Conde. A senior government officer 
told me that the government is taking all necessary measures to 
maintain law and order in Machinta and its environment.

  [Summary from poor reception] In 1993 Guinea focused on 
economic development through multilateral and bilateral 
cooperation. Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Minister Ibrahima 
Sylla gave a breakdown on the financial agreements: "We signed 
49 financial agreements in 1993, 16 of which were bilateral and 
33 of which were multilateral. Guinea obtained (?$298.163 
million) from the agreements." The money was used to fund rural 
development projects. Of the funds, (?10) percent was spent on 
infrastructure, 16 percent on the [words indistinct], and the 
rest on water projects, electricity, the administrative sector, 
and so on. "The country obtained (?$132.9 million) from 
bilateral agreements," and [figure indistinct] from multilateral 
agreements. We obtained $41 million in loans.

  [Text] Monrovia, Jan 5 (AFP) -- The United Nations has 
called on a Liberian armed faction to return goods stolen when 
it raided a refugee camp in the north of the country, as a 
precondition for resuming relief work, a UN statement said 
Wednesday. 
  General Daniel Opande, a Kenyan officer leading the UN 
Observer Mission in Liberia, at the weekend met the head of the 
United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), Alhaji Kromah, telling him 
that UN agencies would not pursue aid to some 200,000 displaced 
people in the region until the equipment was returned, the 
statement said. "We will only return to Lofa when the vehicles, 
satellite phone and communications equipment have been returned 
(and we) have a security guarantee for our workers from ULIMO," 
an official with one agency said Wednesday. "Until that is 
done, we have no plans for returning to Lofa." 
  For some eight hours during the night of December 25, about 
a 
dozen ULIMO fighters raided a UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) camp at Vahun near the border with Sierra Leone, 190 
kilometres (120 miles) north of Monrovia, where they made off 
with stocks of food and clothing with an estimated value of more 
than 150,000 dollars. They drove away, with the communications 
equipment, in 12 stolen vehicles including a lorry. 
  Following the attack, the UNHCR, the UN Children's Fund, and 
other relief organisations operating in Lofa County suspended 
their work and withdrew staff from the region. 
  Kromah "promised full cooperation in defusing tension in the 
area," the UN statement said.

  [Excerpts] The cabinet held its regular meeting this 
morning at the conference room of the general secretariat of the 
government at Koulouba under the chairmanship of head of state 
Alpha Oumar Konare. After the examination of the points on the 
agenda, the cabinet made some decisions. Idrissa Camara has 
more: 
  [Camara] [passage omitted] Regarding the Ministry of 
Territorial Administration and Security, the cabinet heard a 
written report on the consultative meeting on displaced Malians 
currently living in southern Algeria held from 25 to 26 November 
in Geneva, Switzerland, and the meeting held in Nouakchott from 
13 to 14 December on the repatriation and socioeconomic 
rehabilitation of Malian refugees in Mauritania. 
  The signing of the National Pact on 11 April 1992 between 
the 
Government of the Republic of Mali and the Unified Movement and 
Front of the Azawad witnessed the end of the rebellion in 
northern Mali and the announcement of the return and 
socioeconomic rehabilitation of the people who took refuge in 
the neighboring countries. Due to the progressive 
reestablishment of security in the northern areas, the refugees 
are increasingly desirous of returning to their country of 
origin. 
  It is in order to organize and rationalize the different 
repatriation and rehabilitation operations that these 
consultative meetings were held with our partners -- in Geneva 
with the UNHCR, the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development [IFAD], and the Algerian Government representatives, 
and in Niasso with the UNHCR and Mauritanian Government 
representatives. The two meetings enabled the establishment of 
a viable institutional framework for the return and 
rehabilitation of the Malian refugees, the working out of a 
monitoring system for the repatriation operations, and support 
from the UNHCR, IFAD, and the countries of refuge in the 
implementation of the repatriation operations. 
  The two meetings permitted the establishment of the bases 
for 
a rational examination of a strategic approach to the problems 
related to the return of Malian refugees in Mauritania and 
southern Algeria. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Niger, incidents took place in the streets of 
Niamey today: thousands of students took to the streets and 
apparently clashed with the police. At this moment the clashes 
are continuing in the vicinity of the university. Muriel 
Pomponne: 
  [Pomponne] Yes, at the moment students and the police are 
facing one another outside the university. The riot police have 
just received the back-up of gendarmerie reinforcements in order 
to contain the demonstrators who have erected barricades with 
burning tires. The clashes began at about 1630 hours, when 
angry students burned two vehicles of the U.S. Embassy. The 
police went into action using tear gas grenades to disperse the 
demonstration, which was not authorized, and this is when the 
skirmishes began. Thus, at present they are restricted to the 
area of the university. During the afternoon the university's 
4,000 or so students had attempted to reach the Ministry of 
Education to demand the payment of nine months' grant arrears. 
This morning school pupils had organized a sit-in outside the 
same ministry in support of the same demands. The authorities 
say that they are prepared to open negotiations and that they 
are ready to offer payment of six months' arrears during the 
next few days, in accordance with a calendar that is to be 
negotiated, but adding: we have a cash-flow problem with paying 
nine months' grant arrears immediately.

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 6 jan (AFP) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister 
Babagana Kingibe left for Cameroon today to "find a solution to 
the periodic incidents at the two countries' borders," NEWS 
AGENCY OF NIGERIA [NAN] reported this evening. 
  The minister, who did not give details on the incidents that 
took place at the borders, made this statement before leaving 
Lagos for Yaounde, where he arrived this afternoon. 
  Nigeria is determined to maintain close bilateral ties with 
Cameroon, he added, while stressing that his government "will no 
longer tolerate harassement of Nigerian nationals in neighboring 
countries," NAN added with no more details. 
  Neither the radio nor the national television mentioned Mr. 
Kingibe's departure for Cameroon this afternoon. [passage 
omitted] 
  A military joint commission was created in 1986 to delimit 
the final demarcation of the border between the two countries. 
In August 1992, following repeated border incidents, 
Cameroonian Defense Minister Edouard Akame Mfoumou, held 
discussions on the issue with his then Nigerian counterpart, 
General Sani Abacha, now Nigeria's current head of state.

  [Text] Nigeria has denied reports by the Cameroonian 
authorities that its troops have occupied two Cameroonian 
islands in the Gulf of Guinea. The Nigerian Ministry of Defense 
said on Thursday [6 January] that what the Cameroonians were 
complaining about was a normal movement of troops within 
Nigerian territory. 
  Cameroon's foreign minister [title as heard], Mr. Francis 
Nkwain, had alleged that 500 Nigerian soldiers moved into the 
islands on Monday [3 January]. 
  Meanwhile, Nigeria's minister of external affairs, 
Ambassador 
Babagana Kingibe, left for Yaounde on Thursday for talks with 
the Cameroonian authorities on the border issue. Mr. Kingibe 
told a Voice of Nigeria correspondent shortly before he left 
Lagos that the Nigerian Government was determined to end all 
border clashes with Cameroon. The meeting is expected to evolve 
ways of ending the border dispute between the two countries.

  [Text] Lagos, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Ken Saro-Wiwa, a renowned 
Nigerian minority rights activist, and two of his colleagues 
representing the ethnic Ogoni people have been freed after 
several days' detention, press reports said here Thursday. 
  Saro-Wiwa, a former national president of the Association of 
Nigerian Authors, was placed under house arrest last Sunday by 
soldiers in Port Harcourt, capital of the southern Rivers State, 
was released on Tuesday [4 January] night. He heads the 
Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), a pressure 
group representing about 500,000 people. 
  The troops surrounded his residence in the oil city and 
prevented him from going out and from receiving visitors, said 
the reports. 
  Two other MOSOP officials who were arrested on December 28 
and taken to unknown destinations have also regained their 
freedom, the reports said. 
  Saro-Wiwa was detained for about two months last year by the 
regime of former president General Ibrahim Babangida for 
championing the cause of the ethnic Ogoni, who have in recent 
years been complaining about what they see as the neglect, 
injustice and degradation suffered by their community. The 
Ogoni area in Rivers State furnishes a large amount of crude 
oil, the mainstay of the Nigerian economy. 
  The authorities arrested the three as officials called off 
the celebration of "Ogoni week," scheduled to start on December 
28 with a planned address by Saro-Wiwa as a guest speaker, the 
reports said. 
  The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation 
representing some 40 human rights groups and pro-democracy 
organisations, condemned the arrests of the Ogoni activists.

  [Text] The minister of information and culture, Professor 
Jerry Gana, has debunked speculation that the Federal Government 
is organizing the constitutional conference in order to buy 
time. Prof. Gana stated this in Abuja yesterday at a meeting of 
state and directors of the National Orientation Agency. 
  He stressed that the conference was not a forum for 
negotiating the continued existence or otherwise of Nigeria, but 
that of creating an environment for a harmonious federal 
republic. Prof. Gana assured that the government would be firm 
and defensive in its efforts to bring back sanity in the society. 
  Earlier, the director general of the National Orientation 
Agency, Professor Elochukwu Amuchiaze, had noted that the 
proposed conference was aimed at [word indistinct] the Nigerian 
Constitution.

  [Text] The postmaster general of the Nigerian Postal 
Services [Nipost], Mr. (Nathaniel Zumi), and three other 
management staff of the organization have been suspended 
indefinitely. A press release from the Ministry of 
Communications says the minister, Alhaji Abubakar Rimi, ordered 
the suspension of the officials following the findings of an 
internal investigation panel which looked into the operations of 
Nipost. The other suspended officials are Mr. (Egbadin), deputy 
postmaster general, Finance and Investment; Mr. (Zubike 
Ogbonna), deputy postmaster general, Territorial Administration; 
and Mohamed Bashir, secretary, legal adviser of Nipost. They 
are to remain suspended until the final determination of their 
roles in causing financial losses to Nipost and mismanaging its 
affairs. 
  The statement said Mr. (Zumi), as postmaster general, was 
involved in questionable transactions which included the payment 
of more than 43.5 million naira to a foreign airline for the 
hire of aircraft which was not delivered and did not carry any 
mail. He is also said to have paid 50 million to another 
airline without ministerial approval. In the meantime, the head 
of state, General Sani Abacha, has approved the appointment of 
Mr. (Gban Gbele), deputy postmaster general, operations and 
planning, as the acting postmaster general.

  [Text] The AFRICAN WORLD magazine, a pan-African 
publication put together by the former science and technology 
secretary, Professor Barthelemew Unagu, has been launched in 
Lagos. The magazine, which is to serve as a forum for people of 
African descent, was launched by the former education minister, 
Professor Babatunde Fafunwa. Correspondent Anne Aka covered the 
launching. 
  [Begin recording] [Aka] Prof. Fafunwa, while launching the 
magazine, called on those present to subscribe to it. 
  [Fafunwa] I am very very pleased to state that this magazine 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Aka] The publisher, Professor Munagi, said that the 
publication of the magazine was to establish a medium to tell 
the African story through the African perspective. 
  [Munagi] As a forum of all people of African descent, we are 
determined to bridge the communication gap between our peoples 
on the continent, between Africans on the continent and those 
abroad [words indistinct], and between African peoples and the 
rest of humankind. 
  [Aka] The information and culture minister [Professor Jerry 
Gana], who was chairman on the occasion, was represented by his 
special assistant, Dr. Bassa Musa. Prof. Gana said that the 
magazine came at a time when Nigeria's voice as the leader of 
the black world must be heard in the world. He expressed the 
hope that the substance of the magazine would serve as example 
to the Nigerian media in how to crusade for a viewpoint without 
precipitating anarchy and violence, particularly now that 
Nigeria is passing through its most trying period in its history. 
  [Musa] This administration recognizes the vital role of the 
media in nation building. It seems competing areas of friction 
notwithstanding, I believe we can jointly work out a meaningful 
partnership for the overall benefit of our great country. 
  [Aka] The magazine was reviewed by Dr. Ruben Agbatsie of THE 
GUARDIAN newspaper. The AFRICAN WORLD, formally known and 
called THE AFRICAN COMMENTARY, was published in 1989 in the 
United States. It is a general interest magazine aimed at 
bridging the communication gap between Africans and the rest of 
the world. It has its contributors made up of eminent African 
writers, scholars, and writers of African descent. The 
launching was attended by the chief of naval staff, Rear Admiral 
Allison Madueke, and the representative of the inspector general 
of police, Mr. Abdulahi Ziga, the Jamaican high commissioner, 
Mr. Dudley Thompson, American ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Walter 
Carrington, and people from all walks of life. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Government communique on postponement of legislative </F>
elections --- place and date not given] 
  [Text] The head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, held 
discussions with Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh at his 
private residence in Lome District 2 yesterday. The discussions 
centered on progress made in the preparations for the upcoming 
legislative elections, which are slated for 23 January and 6 
February. The prime minister informed the president about the 
delays observed in carrying out of some material tasks related 
to the elections. These tasks include the personalization and 
distribution of voting cards. In view of the delays, and taking 
into account French and German electoral experts' views, the 
president and the prime minister agreed that the initially fixed 
dates be revised to help these elections take place in the best 
of conditions. Thus, the first round of legislative elections 
will take place on 6 February, and the second round on 20 
February. It was during their discussions that the president 
and the prime minister were informed that automatic gunfire was 
occurring in various parts of the capital.

National Defense; in Lome on 6 January; from the "News in Brief" 
program -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Yesterday at exactly 1820, while President 
Gnassingbe Eyadema and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh were 
holding discussions at the president's private residence in Lome 
District 2, groups of terrorists lying in ambush along the 
boulevard leading to the head of state's private residence 
opened fire at the presidential vehicle, which was on its way to 
the Togolese Inter-Arm Regime [RIT] camp. The vehicle was 
struck by a rocket, in addition to many bursts of gunfire. This 
vehicle -- which fortunately was not carrying the head of state 
-- managed to escape. Soon afterward, more automatic gunfire was 
heard in many places around the capital, mainly around the RIT 
camp, at the Dove of Peace roundabout, on Hydrocarbon Boulevard, 
and on the lower side of the lagoon, near Cinema Togo. In those 
places, the terrorists, who were in plain clothes and driving 
vehicles without any distinctive signs or license plates, shot 
at everything that moved, sowing panic among citizens who were 
mostly returning home from work. Security forces countered 
these attacks immediately. 
  Another group of terrorists in a Nissan Patrol-like vehicle 
were intercepted at the junction of Boulevard Jean-Paul II and 
Akeyi Street, while heading to a private presidential residence 
in Lome District 2, where the head of state and the prime 
minister were holding discussions. The attacks [word 
indistinct] concentrated on the RIT, (Avedougouome), and Rapid 
Intervention Force [FIR] camps. Outside the FIR camp a Toyota 
pickup vehicle was intercepted and its cargo seized. The cargo 
consisted of a sizable amount of arms, including rockets, 
defensive grenades, 7.62-caliber ammunition and propelling 
cartridges [as heard]. A bus carrying attackers was intercepted 
at (Doudogome), and its passengers were arrested and taken to 
the gendarmerie. Another bus, which was following [words 
indistinct] of their attackers was found on the Kara Boulevard 
with only its driver, who was seriously injured. At the Aflao 
customs post, a Peugeot sedan car, which was trying to force its 
way into Ghana, was fired upon -- the driver was killed on the 
spot. The attackers, who were routed around 0330, tried to 
withdraw to the Ghanaian border. Clashes continued until early 
this morning. 
  The provisional toll is as follows: Seven security forces' 
elements, three civilians, and about 30 attackers were killed, 
while 35 terrorists were arrested. 
  Issued in Lome on 6 January. 
  [Signed] The minister of national defense.

  [Excerpts] Lome, Jan 7 (AFP) -- The Togolese Foreign 
Ministry said here Friday [7 January] it was holding the 
Ghanaian charge d'affairs after charging that artillery fire was 
being rained on a border post from neighbouring Ghana. 
  The Togolese Foreign Ministry called on Ghana to intervene 
against "armed elements coming from Ghana," saying in a radio 
statement at midnight (0000 GMT) that it had seized the Ghanaian 
charge d'affairs at 2130 GMT Thursday. 
  The government has alleged that a group of unidentified men 
who led a failed assassination bid against Togo's military ruler 
Gnassingbe Eyademe Wednesday came from Ghana. [passage omitted] 
  Reached by telephone early Friday morning, residents living 
close to the border post which separates Lome from its twin town 
of Aflao in Ghana said that shots and explosions resembling 
artillery fire had shaken the area shortly before 0100 GMT. 
  The Togolese Foreign Ministry denounced what it termed "a 
flagrant act of aggression," which was "against all 
international law." It said that despite holding the Ghanaian 
charge d'affairs, shooting was "still coming from Ghanaian 
territory." 
  "The government calls on the international community to bear 
witness and asks Ghana to put an immediate end to these acts," 
the statement added. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Lome, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Togolese troops and police 
sealed off the capital Friday [7 January] and fighting was 
reported along the border with Ghana after a bloody coup bid 
that officials said was launched from the neighbouring country. 
  Frightened residents stayed off the streets of Lome, which 
was generally quiet after two days of shooting and artillery 
fire that begun with an attempt Wednesday to assassinate 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema. 
  The assassination bid and a subsequent attack on the Tokoin 
military barracks where Eyadema has his official [residence] 
left at least 40 people dead, according to government officials. 
  A military source told AFP that a police post on the border 
with Ghana and several neighbouring houses had been destroyed 
overnight by "mortar fire from inside Ghanaian territory." 
  "Armed groups" tried to cross into Togo during the night but 
were driven back, the source added, refusing to comment on 
whether the attackers were exiled Togolese or Ghanaians. 
  Reached by telephone, residents living close to the border 
post separating Lome from its twin town of Aflao in Ghana said 
that shots and explosions had shaken the area shortly before 
1:00 A.M. (0100 GMT). 
  Early Friday, the Togolese foreign ministry announced that 
it 
had taken the Ghanaian charge d'affairs into detention and 
called on the government in Accra to intervene against "armed 
elements coming from Ghana." [passage omitted] 
  Lome was sealed off by soldiers, police and paramilitary 
police, who stopped all vehicles at roadblocks as rumours of 
"war with Ghana" spread through the city. [passage omitted] 
  Friday some fearful residents of this city of 600,000 people 
said they planned to flee with their families to Benin, which 
lies to the east of Togo, on the other side of the small West 
African nation from Ghana. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Talks between the government and the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have already 
resumed in Lusaka. The parties are discussing the issue of the 
national police. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel has further 
details from Lusaka: 
  [Manuel] Good evening. The second round of peace talks has 
already begun and there has already been a break. During this 
morning's plenary session, the United Nations presented a 
document on the national police to be examined by the 
negotiating teams. This is the issue that is currently being 
discussed. The negotiating teams examined the document and 
UNITA requested a break to give a reply. Thus, there was no 
meeting this afternoon. 
  Political observers here in Lusaka are questioning the 
powers 
of UNITA's new negotiating team. We say new team, because the 
head now is General Eugenio Manuvakola and the deputy head is 
Jorge Valentim. Antonio Dembo, the former head of the 
delegation, and Generals Ben-Ben and Gato did not return to 
Lusaka. Some people say that all this is part of UNITA strategy 
to [words indistinct] things. This not the first time that 
this is happening. In each negotiating round, UNITA always 
changes the heads of its delegations. According to political 
observers, this change is part of its strategy not to bind the 
new head by agreements made by the former head [words 
indistinct]. This was the case in Addis Ababa and also in 
Abidjan. Here, we have to wait and see [words indistinct] duly 
sign agreements reached. 
  Meanwhile, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Pedro Fernando 
Mavunza convened the national and foreign press to report that 
UNITA continues to carry out a movement of its war machinery. 
The ambassador cites a communique from the General Staff of the 
Angolan Armed Forces. 
  According to a reliable source, UNITA continues to reaffirm 
its intention to occupy some key posts in the government and 
favors the holding of local elections. All this will be placed 
on the negotiating table after the discussion of the issue of 
the national police. UNITA asked Alioune Blondin Beye to give 
it a break to examine the UN document on the national police 
[words indistinct].

  [Text] The Angolan Government is involved in diplomatic 
activities to coordinate its efforts in the search for peace in 
Angola. Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura yesterday delivered 
a message from President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali. The message deals with issues linked to 
Angola's current political situation. Minister Venancio de 
Moura, who has been visiting New York for three days, took the 
opportunity to hold talks with high officials from the U.S. 
State Department and White House to discuss the country's 
political crisis. Afonso van Dunem, Angola's ambassador to 
United Nations, had this to say on the issue: 
  [Begin Van Dunem recording] In brief, I can say that the 
foreign minister has been in New York for two days and his visit 
is aimed at delivering a message from the president of the 
republic to the UN secretary general. It was a very timely, 
useful, and busy visit. [end recording] 
  We asked Afonso van Dunem to comment about the meeting 
between the Angolan foreign minister and the UN secretary 
general on the establishment of the new UNAVEM [UN Angola 
Verification Mission]-3 contingent, and he said: 
  [Begin Van Dunem Recording] This issue was touched on 
because 
a number of steps must be taken before the UNAVEM-2 is 
transformed to UNAVEM-3. First, the Security Council has to 
meet and approve a resolution sanctioning the UN secretary 
general undertaking a process of political and logistical 
transformation, and this has a number of implications. However, 
the time has not yet come for the Security Council to discuss 
the issue of UNAVEM-2's transformation to UNAVEM-3. Obviously, 
all this will depend on the whole process, since this does not 
depend only on our government. It depends on concrete 
conditions on the ground, on the talks which are under way, and 
as I have said, on the whole peace process in Angola. [end 
recording] 
  In his diplomatic mission, as well as dealing with political 
issues, the Angolan foreign minister took the opportunity to 
appeal to the international community to assist the victims of 
war in the country. 
  [Begin Van Dunem] Our government's priority is not only 
political issues regarding the peace process, but also issues 
linked to humanitarian aid by the international community, 
namely the United Nations. [end recording]

January] 
  [Text] The Malange incident is yet another example of 
manipulation by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola [MPLA] government, which will not be happy with any peace 
accord arising from the Lusaka peace talks. 
  1. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] was advised of a possible visit by U.S. Democratic Party 
congressmen to Bie on 4 and 5 January. Through UN channels, we 
were subsequently informed that the U.S. team would no longer be 
visiting Bie. We received that message in the afternoon of 4 
January. It said nothing else. How could the UNITA [word 
indistinct] guess that the U.S. team's itinerary had been 
changed and that it would go to Malange instead? 
  2. Between 11 December and today, 5 January, the government 
carried out three attacks against Bie. 
  A. The commission sent by UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye established beyond doubt that the MPLA-Labor Party 
air force had in fact dropped bombs on Bie [words indistinct] 
the Americans [words indistinct] while peace was being 
negotiated in Lusaka, (?in accordance with) Luanda's orders. 
  B. On the eve of the arrival of the team of U.S. congressmen 
in Angola, the MPLA General Staff issued a communique reporting 
that UNITA forces had carried out an attack on the oil-rich area 
of Malongo, in Cabinda Province [words indistinct] afterward. 
The MPLA General Staff had lied in a bid to impress the team of 
U.S. congressmen. 
  C. Now, the MPLA government is taking the same U.S. team to 
Malange to make an impression at any cost, even that of human 
lives [words indistinct] the government [words indistinct] on 28 
December of last year [words indistinct] the various comments 
[words indistinct] that the enemies of peace for Angola are not 
to be found inside the MPLA alone. They can also be found 
abroad [words indistinct] in Lusaka, where we have a team [words 
indistinct] what the MPLA government is capable of doing.

  [Text] The Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda 
Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda [FLEC-FAC] has once again 
claimed responsibility for the attack on Malongo in Cabinda. A 
spokesman for the organization says the attack on the Chevron 
installations in Cabinda was aimed at making sure that Luanda 
did not use oil revenue for buying arms to kill Angolans. The 
FLEC-FAC source said Cabinda oil accounts for two-thirds of the 
state's revenues, three-fourths of which are spent on war. The 
Luanda government, as was the case of Malanje, wanted to blame 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola for the 
attack on Malongo. This is after all an old communist method 
which is still used by Luanda to score advantages over political 
and military situations.

important to note that [words indistinct] FAPLA marines recently 
concluded their military training in Portugal.

<F P=106> [Interview with Domingos Hungo, governor of Cuando Cubango </F>
Province, by unidentified reporter; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Good evening, Governor Hungo. Cuando 
Cubango Province is often referred to as the land at the end of 
the world. Do you agree with that name? 
  [Hungo] Yes, you are quite right. It is really the land at 
the end of the world. 
  [Reporter] The military situation appears to be taking on 
difficult overtones? 
  [Hungo] Yes, it is true, the military situation is becoming 
somewhat complex because the enemy, the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], continues to siege the 
farming areas where the people go to fetch food. UNITA 
continues to train men in its old bases. Relatively low 
intensity shelling continues to claim lives, as do ambushes and 
mines. We would have liked to take advantage of the opportunity 
we have been given. If there is no peace, it will be tragic for 
the people of Cuando Cubango Province, who have had to endure 
this protracted war. 
  [Reporter] Governor Hungo: How do you reconcile the fact 
that UNITA is attending the Lusaka peace talks while attacking 
your province? 
  [Hungo] We have known UNITA for a long time now and UNITA 
has 
always behaved like this. At a time when talks are under way, 
UNITA appears to feel compelled to show its military might so it 
can participate in the talks on equal terms with the government. 
Moreover, UNITA has always displayed bad faith in relation to 
the Angolan people, thereby showing its poor political 
capabilities and its failure to accept the democratic game. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Governor Hungo: Do you think that the peace 
proclaimed by UNITA is false? 
  [Hungo] We must see to believe. I am not trying to weave any 
tales here. I have known UNITA since 1964 and our relations 
have always led to dead ends. We discuss peace, peace, and 
peace yet again, and it has been 30 years that UNITA has 
prevented us from enjoying peace. I think that we must really 
see to believe, but seeing all their twists and turns I am less 
than confident. Let me give you the concrete example of Malange 
yesterday: If they were really interested in signing a 
cease-fire accord and bringing peace to the Angolan people, they 
would not have shelled Malange yesterday. There were U.S. 
congressmen visiting the city and the United States backed UNITA 
for a long time. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Governor: And how has Cuando Cubango Province 
been defended? 
  [Hungo] I am happy about the way defensive operations have 
been organized in my province. Together with the civilian 
defense force, the defense and security troops have been 
indefatigable in their preparedness. This has meant that our 
troops have become more organized and more experienced. I can 
even tell you that we are ready for anything at any time. With 
the help of the central government, we shall take the 
appropriate steps to defend Cuando Cubango Province. 
  [Reporter] The land at the end of the world... 
  [Hungo] That is correct!

  [Text] The president, Sir Ketumile Masire, says Botswana 
offers foreign investors advantages such as good transport and 
communication links with neighboring countries. Other 
advantages include her liberal foreign exchange regime, a stable 
source of a political system, and respect for the rule of law. 
  He was speaking at a dinner he hosted last night for 
Governor 
Douglas Wilder of the American State of Virginia at State House. 
Governor Wilder is in Botswana to inaugurate Virginia's Trade 
and Investment Office for southern Africa. 
  President Masire said his government intends to follow and 
extend the policies that have made Botswana an attractive place 
to establish the Virginia Trade and Investment Office. He noted 
that Botswana recently completed formal procedures to join the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, as part of her 
program to make the economy more open and competitive. 
  The president said the diversification of Botswana's economy 
should open new opportunities for the supply of goods and 
services to his country and new sources of supply for Virginia 
and the United States. Sir Ketumile noted that the next few 
years will be momentous for the southern Africa region as steps 
are being taken to achieve peace. The president added that 
there's hope for peace and stability in Mozambique. Other 
countries in the region are, with different degrees of success, 
taking steps to put their economies on order. 
  Governor Wilder and his party flew to Kasane today where 
[name indistinct] is hosting a business lunch for them where 
they will meet key members of the business community. Mr. 
Wilder returns to Gaborone tomorrow to appoint the first 
representative of the Virginia trade office.

<F P=106> [Article by Lourenco Jossias and Orlando Muchanga: "The </F>
General's Lax Response"] 
  [Text] (Maputo) The duel between Afonso Dhlakama, 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, and Mozambican 
Army General Domingos Fondo, promises new developments in the 
wake of the news conference granted by Gen. Fondo yesterday. In 
reply to Afonso Dhlakama's accusation that the general is linked 
to deals involving arms smuggling to South Africa, Gen. Fondo 
said -- without too much conviction -- that he denied Dhlakama's 
charges and that the Renamo leader should present his complaints 
to the right authorities. 
  In appearance at least, Gen. Domingos Fondo was very much at 
ease during his meeting with the press. The allegation that he 
was involved in smuggling weapons to neighboring South Africa 
fell like a bomb in this country and in southern Africa, but his 
answer was that he was not disturbed by it. He failed to 
categorically deny the Renamo leader's accusation, thereby doing 
little more than raising more doubts. 
  "I do not understand whether he (Dhlakama) is accusing me as 
a citizen, a general, a public servant in the National Defense 
Ministry, a Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, official, or 
as a member of Parliament", he said, adding, by way of 
clarification, that our country has "an institution that deals 
with matters such as this one" and that, should Dhlakama "be in 
possession of concrete evidence, he should bring the matter 
before the court." 
  It was quite clear that the general was talking with some 
anxiety. He was repeatedly asked whether he accepted the Renamo 
leader's accusation, to which he replied that "I deny it as an 
individual, but I say that he must take the case before the 
competent authorities" instead of "making such claims in public." 
  After much rhetoric, the general was invited to comment on 
what he would do about Dhlakama's remarks now, seeing that his 
"good name" may well be tarnished. "Nothing", the general 
replied, causing some surprise among the reporters who had 
flocked to his modest office. 
  We asked him whether he did not feel offended or aggrieved, 
to which he answered: No, "I do not feel offended yet", adding 
rather tersely that if the Renamo leader does not take his 
complaint to court "then he is a liar." 
  Gen. Domingos Fondo's name regularly crops up in 
international media reports as being linked to arms and drugs 
smugglers. He was asked to comment on this matter, but he 
refused to do it, saying: "No one has ever talked to me about 
arms smuggling. This is the first time I hear anything about 
it." Gen. Fondo added that no Mozambican State organ has 
approached him in connection with that matter yet. "Neither the 
Attorney General's Office, nor the Interior Ministry, nor 
anybody else", he stressed. 
  Gen. Fondo surprised the reporters with the contempt he 
showed for Dhlakama's accusations, saying "I am not afraid of 
anything, I am at peace with myself, and I am not worried. I am 
free and that is why I go where I please." 
  At one point in the course of the news conference, Gen. 
Fondo 
was asked whether he would be willing some day to serve in the 
Mozambique Armed Forces under Afonso Dhlakama's command. His 
reply was typical: "As long as I am an active serviceman, I 
shall obey whoever wins, whether that be Dhlakama, Arouca, or 
anybody else. I shall obey as long as I am in active service." 
To the general surprise of his audience, Gen. Fondo added, 
pointing out one of the journalists: "Even if it is you..." 
  We asked him whether, as a businessman, he had business 
interests in South Africa, to which he replied that "if you have 
come to talk to me as a businessman, then I must take off my 
uniform and talk as a businessman." 
  Major General Domingos Fondo heads the forces responsible 
for 
the protection of projects. During the war, those forces were 
involved in the defense of economic targets. Gen. Fondo 
explained that his forces are being disbanded because they are 
irregular and must be scrapped in terms of the Rome Accord, 
adding that "almost half of the soldiers have already been 
demobilized and their weapons are being collected by the UN 
Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, and taken to the general 
storehouse." 
  In any event, there are complaints that many weapons have 
been disappearing from that army unit. Answering the question, 
Maj. Gen. Fondo said that "there are institutions responsible 
for controlling the weapons. There has been widespread 
disappearance of weapons from the National Defense Ministry 
[words indistinct] a meeting. Gen. Fondo said that the problem 
of alleged arms trafficking to South Africa had not been raised 
during his meeting with Army General Alberto Chipande. "We 
always talk about work when we meet", Gen. Fondo explained. 
  During the news conference, Domingos Fondo distributed 
calling cards which carried the name of `Spanos da Beira' 
company and he said, by way of explanation: "That is my company." 
  Yesterday, MEDIAFAX learned from an official in the Criminal 
Investigation Police, PIC, Arms Smuggling Investigation Branch 
that Gen. Fondo's name had never featured on any list of 
suspects. 
  "Our leads have never mentioned his name. We have never 
received any complaint concerning the general. We know nothing 
about it in this branch, but perhaps other institutions know 
something", that source said. When we asked whether there might 
be other important Mozambican Army names on the list, our source 
said no, admitting only that he knew about "persons who have 
been arrested at the border while in possession of a weapon or 
two, which they intended to use for armed robberies in South 
Africa", he noted. 
  Our source went so far as to question the correctness of the 
words, arms trafficking to South Africa. Faced with our own 
doubts, he wound up the conversation by saying that he could 
only answer other questions upon permission by senior Interior 
Ministry officials. 
  We were not any more successful at the local Interpol 
[International Police] directorate. Other Interpol sources whom 
we tried discreetly to contact assured us that they had never 
received anything concerning that matter and that Gen. Domingos 
Fondo's name had never been discussed by Interpol agents. 
  Despite our insistent efforts, we were not able to get in 
touch with any senior officials in the Interior Ministry or the 
Attorney General's Office by the time this edition went to print.

  [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission will once again meet in 
Maputo tomorrow to discuss the withdrawal of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] from the Salamanga area in Maputo 
Province. Government Major Eduardo Lauchande yesterday said 
Renamo forces are supposed to withdraw 10 km northeast or 30 km 
south from the area they are occupying. However, Raul Domingos, 
Renamo's head of Political Affairs Department, said his 
movement's soldiers will not withdraw those distances. Raul 
Domingos said the Renamo forces will only withdraw 700 meters 
from the boundary the of Salamanga state farm. The government 
had earlier announced that Renamo occupied the Salamanga area 
after 4 October 1992 and Renamo admitted this after 
investigations carried out by a tripartite team.

  [Excerpt] Government soldiers confined to the Namialo 
assembly area in Nampula Province are demanding to know their 
future -- namely, whether they are to be demobilized or to join 
the future apolitical unified army. The 941 soldiers at Namialo 
confinement center want their situations defined so that they 
can start organizing their lives after many years of military 
life. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Government troops are without food at the 
Namialo Assembly Point of Nampula Province. Food for 941 
soldiers ran out today. Our correspondent reports that 200 kg 
of rice and a few tins of cooking oil were distributed to the 
soldiers today. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, UN Captain 
Rudolfo Dulce says a truck with food supplies for 1,000 men was 
scheduled to arrive at Namialo this evening. The food will last 
30 days, but the soldiers have complained about the quality of 
meals served at the assembly point. [passage omitted] 
  In Cabo Delgado, 1,207 government soldiers had already been 
accommodated at the Montepuez Assembly Point by 3 January, 
despite logistical problems like a lack of food, household 
utensils, water, and medicines. [passage omitted] 
  In a press release, the provincial government's 
representative at the Cabo Delgado branch of the Supervision and 
Control Commission says it is extremely worried about continued 
violations of the peace accord by the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo]. The press release says Renamo has not yet 
sent its guerrillas to assembly points, and that armed members 
of that organization are moving in most districts of Cabo 
Delgado. The document adds that in Montepuez District on 22 
December, Renamo elements arrested the president of the (Napapo) 
village, allegedly because he was carrying a firearm. He was 
released two days later. Renamo is also accused of having 
deployed armed men in the (Napala) village of Chiure District. 
The presence of Renamo members from various bases, including 
the Maringue headquarters have been reported in Pemba. 
  In Niassa Province, Renamo says the peace accord is being 
battered. Renamo Foreign Relations chief Jose de Castro said in 
Lichinga today that many aspects of the accord are not being 
fulfilled, notably Protocols 3 and 4 which deal with logistics. 
He said the government is not adhering to the protocols. 
Castro said Renamo delegates have no houses in various 
provinces, and that the government's repressive apparatus is 
being used to intimidate the people. Castro said many people 
fear joining Renamo because the government prevents them from 
doing so, although 100 per cent of the country's population 
favors his movement. He said the people have grown tired of 
Frelimo and want a change. 
  [Begin Castro recording] In Mavago and other assembly points 
our forces are facing hardships because of logistical problems. 
The peace accord is not being applied evenly. Our troops have 
not been defeated or amnestied, but have actually won the war 
against several foreign armies and the Frelimo army. The 
government should take that into account and review the 
logistical situation in Mavago. [end recording] 
  Jose de Castro arrived in Lichinga today to deal with the 
appointment of Renamo representatives to the electoral 
commissions.

pleased to work with each other in harmony. He said when this 
country gained independence from the British in 1968, the then

harmony with him. He said his office has been open to normalize

  [Text] Lusaka -- The Zambian government will kick out 
foreign diplomats and representatives of donor agencies who 
continue to question the governance of the country, says 
government spokesman Remmy Mushota. He was reacting in an 
interview to pressure by foreign aid donors on the Zambian 
government to stamp out corruption and drug trafficking in the 
Cabinet. 
  Mushota said diplomats had international guidelines within 
which to operate "which some have chosen to ignore with impunity 
in Zambia". He said no official complaints had been lodged by 
the Zambian government with the governments of the diplomats in 
question, but added: "The Zambian government will expel foreign 
diplomats who continue to question the governance of the country 
by the State." 
  German ambassador Peter Schmidt said yesterday the 
resignation of Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaaanga on Tuesday was 
not enough to appease the donors. He called for other ministers 
to resign and for more serious government efforts to stamp out 
corruption. 
  Zambian newspapers yesterday carried reports alleging that 
several Cabinet Ministers had misappropriated and shared out 
between them a R[Rand]142 million Japanese grant intended for 
small-scale business development. Political analysts expect 
more Cabinet resignations as the corruption scandal continues to 
rock the government of President Frederick Chiluba. While he 
has not been linked to corruption, Chiluba is being accused of 
weakness or incompetence in failing to stamp it out. 
  The Anti-Corruption Commission, set up by the government, 
says it has begun investigating allegations by Mwaanga that some 
of his former Cabinet colleagues had long been engaged in 
corruption.

  [Text] Zambia's Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga has 
resigned. He says he had to go to allow the government to 
investigate allegations against various cabinet ministers of 
drug trafficking and corruption, but he denies that he has been 
involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and there is still 
pressure on President Frederick Chiluba to dismiss other 
ministers. Our reporter in Zambia, (Anias Nyakuthemba), has 
been watching the reaction to the scandal: 
  [Begin (Nkyakuthemba) recording] Many Zambians and some 
Western diplomats have welcomed the decision by Zambia's foreign 
affairs minister, Vernon Mwaanga, to resign, saying it would 
[words indistinct] precedent and a better government image. 
Mwaanga (?officially) resigned yesterday morning, but his 
action was not entirely unexpected. It follows several weeks, 
if not months, in which pressure from the donors, the 
opposition, and the local media has been piling up on President 
Frederick Chiluba to sack ministers allegedly involved in drug 
trafficking and corrupt practices. Mwaanga said yesterday that 
he was bowing to public pressure to resign his post and to allow 
the government to prove allegations of his involvement in drug 
trafficking even though, he said, he was clean. Mwaanga also 
urged what he called corrupt ministers to resign as well. 
  Many Zambians I interviewed yesterday evening described 
Mwaanga's decision as courageous, (?honest), and an excellent 
example. Others told the BBC that ministers who were allegedly 
corrupt should resign and that, if they (?did not), President 
Chiluba should sack them to repair Zambia's tattered image. 
  Some Western diplomats I talked to also described Mwaanga's 
decision as the right step in the right direction, but added 
more action was needed to restore donor confidence. [end

drug trafficking and corruption to (?civilian) posts. He was

foreign affairs over allegations of drug trafficking and 
corruption. Dr. Mushota said today that a press report which 
said there was division in the [word indistinct] cabinet was a 
misrepresentation of facts. He said in a statement that what he 
had meant to say was that wherever there is a group of people, 
different opinions on issues, including drug trafficking, [words

Thursday [30 December] indicated that there is unity in the 
MMD's [Movement for Multiparty Democracy] policy-making body.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has lashed out 
at the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] for accusing 
it of rewarding terrorism. This follows reports of Robert 
McBride's nomination to the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region's election list. McBride, who planted a 
bomb at Magoo's Bar in Durban, is the second most popular 
candidate on the ANC's list. The AVF has called McBride a mass 
murderer. It says his popularity follows what the AVF calls the 
already alarming reemergence of convicted kidnapper Winnie 
Mandela. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus says McBride is working 
hard for peace: 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] Comrade McBride is making a very 
important contribution to work for peace in the eastern parts of 
Johannesburg, and he has been particularly strongly involved in 
helping to work for peace in areas such as Thokoza and 
Katlehong. In contrast the AVF, and specific members of that 
Volksfront, has consistently, despite the fact that they have 
the right to participate in negotiations, despite the fact that 
those people that they represent have throughout the history of 
this country had the vote, threatened with violence and with 
civil war. [end recording] 
  Niehaus says the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region nominations for the provincial legislature 
and the National Assembly include top ANC members. He says 
among them are Paul Mashatile, Obed Bapela, Tokyo Sexwale, and 
Ronnie Mamoepa. Niehaus says the nominations are provisional 
names: 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] There is also a number of people 
who have been nominated by the PWV region for the National 
Assembly. Among these people are Janet Love, who is the deputy 
director of the Transitional Executive Council, and there are 
also a considerable number of other senior members of the ANC 
that have been nominated. The person who appears on the list as 
the most popular candidate for the provincial legislature of the 
PWV region is Obed Bapela. [end recording]

  [Text] Serious incidents have taken place between Fulani 
cattlemen and gendarmes in Ketou, in the Bonou subprefecture. 
Master Sergeant Moussa Adamou of the Bonou Gendarmerie Brigade 
almost lost his life during the squabble. He was saved by his 
colleagues, who rescued him from the Fulanis. Here with the 
details is Isidore Zinsou: 
  [Zinsou] Indeed, for a few days now there have been 
persistent rumors concering the movements of Fulani cattlemen 
and their cattle towards the pastures in Gnahui-Zume, in Bonou 
subprefecture in the Oueme District. We remember the incidents 
that took place last year during their crossing of the region, 
incidents that left bitter memories in the district. This time, 
it is during the end of year festivities that the Fulanis 
cattelmen settled in Ketou in the Oueme district. Informed of 
the situation, the Bonou Gendarmerie Brigade sent a four-member 
team to the locality on 3 January, along with two members of the 
Association for the Development of the Bonou Subprefecture. The 
presence of the team on the field has merely reactivated the 
aggressiveness of the Fulanis, who were armed with sophisticated 
weapons. The result of the clashes is four wounded gendarmes 
and a pair of handcuffs that were taken away by the Fulanis 
cattlemen. The gendarme master sergeant was wounded on his 
forehead and arms. As for the members of the team, they were 
all beaten up with clubs by the Fulanis. The gendarmes seized 
nine 12-caliber cartridges and a sophiscated French-manufactured 
gun. 
  According to some of the region's inhabitants, the Fulani 
assailants -- some 30 Fulanis armed with clubs and guns -- 
stormed certain houses searching for gendarmes. The same 
sources said that the Fulanis were ready to fight back any 
attack from the people of Bonou. It should be recalled that 
such incidents between the people of Oueme Valley and Fulani 
cattlemen are frequent every year in December. Last year, 
several people were killed in similar incidents. 
  Let us simply wish for calm to return to the region.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Angola peace talks [words indistinct] back to 
life again in Lusaka today, a day late, after a Christmas break 
of two weeks. The talks have already been interrupted by UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] claims 
that the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] 
government army had tried to kill Jonas Savimbi and in the past 
couple of weeks, they have had more incidents in Angola. Only 
yesterday, UNITA prevented American congressmen from visiting 
Malanje, where they launched a bombardment of the town. 
  When the talks began again today, the atmosphere was 
apparently less than cordial, but there is also some optimism. 
From Lusaka, Joel Mwinga faxed this report: 
  This morning, the two sides held a plenary session and 
discussions opened with a debate on the composition and role of 
a future police force. UNITA is demanding that the current 
Angolan police force be transformed from what it described as a 
partisan military unit into a nonpartisan civic force. UNITA 
says it wants it what calls extreme elements of the force to be 
disbanded and more UNITA men to be recruited into the police. 
  The government and the rebel UNITA movement have spent the 
past few days blaming each other as the fighting has intensified 
in Angola, but both sides have said that they are determined 
that the talks which started on 15th November last year produce 
a peace settlement. Despite continued fighting in the country, 
the two sides have made steady progress and there is agreement 
in principle on the terms for a cease-fire as well as the 
composition of a future national army. A meeting of military 
experts from both sides will take place in Sao Tome next week to 
try and conclude details for a military pact.

  [Excerpt] Central African Republic President Ange-Felix 
Patasse and Equatorial Guinea President Obiang Nguema M'Basogo 
stopped yesterday afternoon at Houphouet-Boigny International 
Airport on their way to Dakar to take part in the summit of 
franc zone heads of state. 
  The two leaders spoke briefly to the press, expressing 
notably their deepest condolences to the Ivorian people on the 
death of the dean of African heads of state, His Excellency 
Felix Houphouet- Boigny. Concerning the franc zone summit in 
the Senegalese capital, Equatorial Guinea's president was 
categorical, affirming that his country is ready to accept other 
economic measures like structural adjustment, but not CFA 
devaluation. According to him, devaluation will not contribute 
anything concrete to the African economy, in particular to 
Equatorial Guinea, which joined the franc zone in 1983. 
  The Central African head of state said that Africa needs a 
consensus and a spirit of unity to find an adequate solution to 
the problem of the franc zone and the corollary issue of GATT. 
According to President Patasse, Africa's economic, industrial, 
and social fabric has been sorely tested for a very long time 
and as a result it would be premature to talk of a CFA franc 
devaluation. The Central African Republic is against devaluation 
at this time when Africa is more than ever feeling its way, he 
stressed. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A delegation of about 400 people, all members of 
the National Federation of Teachers and activists of the 
Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire --African Democratic Rally 
[PDCI-RDA], was received on 7 January by the head of state, his 
Excellency Henri Konan Bedie. On the occasion, the head of 
state delivered a message that he described as "a message of 
peace and security for all," even if meetings are held during 
which some people threaten to disrupt peace in Cote d'Ivoire.

chairman of the PDCI-RDA teachers federation. 
  President Konan Bedie refrained from any lengthy speech on 
schools with regard to the period of mourning we are observing 
in Cote d'Ivoire. He nonetheless stressed the essential role 
played by teachers in the training of the youth, a role the head 
of state is willing to "support and facilitate any time the need 
arises and when we have the necessary means to help." 
  In view of the current situation, the president of the 
Republic called on his visitors to above all "strive to 
safeguard what has already been achieved and of which peace is 
the first victory." "Cote d'Ivoire wants to live in peace," he 
insists. "We should not play with peace. Peace should be an 
attitude. We should mobilize to ensure peace at all times." He 
added, "Oh, I know pretty well that a lot of nonsense is now 
circulating in Abidjan spread by irresponsible people, and what 
they are saying does not contribute to a sense of peace. We are 
regularly briefed on their meetings, which take place night and 
day in Abidjan, with plans to disrupt the peace Ivorians are 
enjoying.... 
  I can assure you that, before or after the funeral of 
President Houphouet-Boigny, Ivorians always want peace and a 
peaceful atmosphere. I would also like to say that no 
disturbances will be tolerated. 
  Let us suppose that a plot exists in that sense. We would 
resolutely crush the plotters. We have an eye night and day on 
these meetings, wherever they are held." 
  In conclusion, the head of state praised the exemplary sense 
of patriotism showed by the members of the PDCI-RDA teachers 
federation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Togo authorities are getting very upset over 
the continuing mayhem in the wake of the raid on Wednesday [5 
January] night by a contingent of armed men on the military 
headquarters in Lome. It seems President Eyadema was a prime 
target for the guerrillas but escaped with his life. Sporadic 
firing went on for much of yesterday. The Togo authorities 
claim that the raiders came across the border from neighboring 
Ghana but did not point a finger directly at any opposition 
group or the Ghana Government. 
  But yesterday there was shooting along the border and the 
Togo Government has now issued an angrily worded statement. On 
the line to Lome, Alex Martin asked our correspondent Ebow 
Godwin what the statement says: 
  [Begin recording] [Ebow] Well, the Togolese authorities have 
been accusing Ghana of acts of flagrant aggression. They say 
that a group of armed men including Ghanaian soldiers yesterday 
evening opened fire on the Togo border post along the Aflao 
border with Ghana, and that they also opened fire on Togolese 
soldiers but they asked their soldiers not to return fire, in 
order to avoid what could have been a bloody confrontation. A 
government communique was issued by Togo's minister for foreign 
affairs, Ouattara Fambare Natchaba. He said that Togo has 
actually lodged official protest with the Ghanaian charge 
d'affaires in Togo and asked for explanation. 
  [Martin] Has anyone else been saying anything? 
  [Ebow] Well, according to the Togolese authorities the 
Ghanaian charge d'affaires has denied Ghanaian involvement in 
the incident. Well, Mr. Kokou Koffigoh has come out today to 
confirm the incident -- the border incident -- and says that 
Togo has taken notice of Ghana's denial but has appealed to the 
Ghanaian authorities to match their words with action and 
comportment because Togo desires to live in peace with her 
neighbors. 
  [Martin] But according to other reports, there was fighting 
precisely last night from 10 o'clock onwards along the border 
near the security post. What explains the extent of fighting? 
  [Ebow] As at now, I have no evidence of any extensive 
fighting along the border. What I know of is that the Togolese 
authorities, especially the security forces, have been mounting 
a manhunt for fleeing fugitives -- for those who took part in 
armed attack against Togo. Reports say that some of them are 
hiding in houses along the Togolese side of the border and they 
are looking for opportunity to slip into Ghana. There have been 
a lot of shooting along the Togolese side of the frontier but I 
am not aware of any heavy fighting between Togo or Togolese 
soldiers and any other combatants. [end recording] 
  Every time there is trouble in Togo it seems the finger gets 
pointed at Ghana with veiled, or as in this case not so veiled 
allegations. On the line to Accra, Alex Martin asks Foreign 
Minister Obed Asamoah if Ghana was involved in the latest 
trouble: 
  [Begin recording] [Asamoah] As far as we are concerned there 
is nothing yet to confirm that indeed any persons crossed from 
Ghana to Togo. If you consider the intensity of the fighting, 
it would be difficult not to ascribe the fighting to internal 
divisions within the military in Togo. 
  [Martin] It does seem very likely however that elements 
opposed to the government of President Eyadema could have 
crossed over the border from Ghana? 
  [Asamoah] Well, we do not have any evidence pointing to that 
at the moment. And I do not want to speculate on that. 
  [Martin] Is it possible that there are small training camps 
hidden along the border for opposition to President Eyadema's 
government to train supporters to launch this kind of attack? 
  [Asamoah] There is no such thing as far as I know. 
  [Martin] What about the Togolese refugees who are based in 
camps in Ghana. Do you think these could be hotbeds of defense 
to President Eyadema's government? [sentence as heard] 
  [Asamoah] You know, the refugee camps are open places, I 
mean, along the main roads. Anybody can walk in there. And, 
you know, I cannot imagine that these camps are training camps 
for any dissidents. I do not think anything of that nature is 
going on in those refugee camps. [end recording]

  [Text] Togolese refugees, who had settled in Ghanaian 
villages very close to the border with Togo during the 1991 
crisis, are now converging at Aflao following alleged persistent 
bombardment of the villages by Togolese troops. More than 500 
Togolese who settled at Folikope, (Kakakope), and (Aziatakukope) 
near Pillar Six on the Ghana-Togo border last year have deserted 
their homes following alleged widespread shelling of their 
villages. The fleeing Togolese, including women and children, 
are all being put up temporarily at the Roman Catholic primary 
school. The Ketu district secretary, Dr. Andrew Amuzukpeglo, 
has met with the leaders of the new refugee groups and has 
promised them shelter at a refugee camp at Kliko, which had 
accommodates more than 12,000 Togolese refugees. 
  Meanwhile, the fleeing Togolese say Ghanaians are the main 
target of persecution under a house-to-house search being 
conducted by Togolese soldiers in Lome. The reports speak of 
Togolese soldiers demanding Togolese identity cards from each 
household. In another development, Lome radio today announced 
the reopening of Togo's border with Benin and Burkina Faso, with 
that of Ghana still closed.

  [Excerpt] The foreign minister, Dr. Obed Asamoah, has made 
strong representation to the Togolese charge d'affaires in Accra 
on the shelling of the office and residential accommodation of 
Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service, CEPS, at Aflao by 
Togolese forces following the fighting in Lome in the last 
couple of days. A statement issued by the ministry in Accra 
today said the shelling caused extensive damage to buildings and 
injured three persons who are now on admission at the Saint 
Anthony's Hospital at Dzodze. The statement said the Ghana 
Government deplores the ritual accusation by the Togolese 
authorities of Ghana for anything that goes wrong in Togo and 
advises the Togolese Government to put an end to this. It also 
demanded that the Togolese forces be restrained from indulging 
in acts of provocation which would only lead to the worsening of 
the already tense situation at the border. The statement said 
Ghana has no intention of intervening in the internal affairs of 
Togo. It said the problems of Togo are not the making of Ghana 
but are the result of the refusal of the Togolese authorities to 
implement a credible program of democratization in the country. 
  Commercial activities in the Aflao border post have come to 
a 
standstill following the closure of the Togo side of the border. 
Correspondent Rauf Avavonyor visited the border post yesterday. 
His report is read from the studio. 
  [Announcer] At the time the news team visited the border, it 
was almost empty. There was apparently a kind of war being 
waged from the Togo side against installations and buildings on 
the Ghana side of the border. Officers quarters of the CEPS and 
the Ministry of Health block had been badly damaged by a barrage 
of bullets and mortar fire from the Togo side. There are also 
reports of horrifying and indiscriminate shelling and killings. 
According to customs officials, the Togolese soldiers lined up 
12 shoe-shine boys at their side of the border and shot them. 
Yesterday, three women and a child were similarly killed and 
their bodies dumped in a vehicle and driven away. Some 
residents along the Ghana side of the border spoke of stray 
bullets landing in their homes and destroying their fittings and 
property. The CEPS officers quarters appeared to have been 
their main target. Sporadic shootings from the Togo side of the 
border could still be heard at the time of the visit. 
  At about 4 PM [1600 GMT] yesterday, the Togolese soldiers at 
the border post started another round of warning shots to drive 
away observers who had gathered at the border post. It was also 
around this time when the Volta regional minister, Mr. Modestus 
Ahiable, was being briefed on the situation by the CEPS sector 
commander, Mr. Cyril Mensah. Meanwhile, stranded passengers 
are putting up at lorry and filling stations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A parade of the Armed forces, the police, prisons, 
and other security services and voluntary organizations took 
place in Accra this morning to mark the first anniversary of the 
Fourth Republic. The president, Flight- Lieutenant Jerry John 
Rawlings, took the salute at the parade. Addressing the 
ceremony, President Rawlings restated the commitment of the 
government to the cause of the nation. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] The government of the progressive 
alliance comprising the National Democratic Congress, the 
National Convention Party, and the Egle Party, is conscious of 
the record of achievements of the revolutionary decade that 
brought Ghana out of conditions of despair and hence our 
commitment to build on the gains that have been made. In 
rededicating ourselves to the task of nation-building today, we 
will be guided by the fact that at the end of the day, we will 
be judged not by the amount of political rhetoric we would have 
generated, but by the concrete and practical achievements we 
would have made in improving the quality of life of our people, 
especially those in the rural areas. 
  Countrymen and women, there is a time for political fanfare, 
there is a time for elections and there is a time for work -- 
for nation-building. Over a year has passed since the 
presidential and parliamentary elections were held. While some 
may already be setting their sights on 1996 and are dreaming 
about their ambitions, we must remember that there is a lot of 
hard work which needs doing now. No matter our political 
persuasions, we must cooperate with each other in ensuring the 
peaceful development of our nation. As a government, we 
recognize that democracy thrives in an atmosphere of tolerance. 
It is for this reason that the government continues to ignore 
the various acts of provocation orchestrated by some political 
interests. However, those amongst them who might be 
contemplating going beyond their ugly noises must take note that 
the government has a constitutional responsibility to maintain 
law and order. [end recording] 
  President Rawlings spoke against acts of provocation by some 
political interest groups. He also spoke about the need to 
foster national unity. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] Our individual and collective 
loyalties to our families, ethnic groups and political parties 
should not be allowed to divide us as a nation. We all have a 
responsibility to promote unity, stability, and development and 
to be actively involved in resolving situations which militate 
against this unity. Countrymen and women, as we commemorate the 
fifth anniversary of the inauguration of the Fourth Republic, we 
should more than ever before be mindful of the challenges that 
lie ahead. And it is only through our collective efforts that we 
can build an enduring foundation for national development. In 
the year ahead, let us have little less of the unproductive 
political rhetorics and a little more concerted and practical 
efforts in those areas which directly affect the lives of our 
people. Productivity, rural development, export promotion, the 
elimination of waste -- these are things which we can all 
contribute towards no matter our affiliations or opinions. 
These are the things which will make our nation competitive in 
the global economic context. 
  As we celebrate the first anniversary of the Fourth 
Republic, 
we must thank God for bringing us this far. We must enter the 
new year with renewed determination to strengthen the 
foundations of national unity, stability, and development. 
Noble countrymen and women, I wish to congratulate the 
contingents on parade for an excellent drill. I also wish once 
again to commend our officers and men in the Armed Forces, the 
police, and the security agencies as well as our various 
revolutionary organs and supporters for their diligence and 
dedication to national unity. I thank you and wish you all, 
once again, a happy anniversary and a happy new year. God be 
with you. [end recording]

  [Text] An eight-member Cuban delegation led by the foreign 
minister, Mr. Roberto Robaina, arrived in Accra last night on a 
two- day official visit. Speaking to newsmen, Mr. Robaina said 
Cuba will survive the U.S. trade embargo imposed on her despite 
the current difficulties she is facing. He said in spite of the 
sanctions, basic social services such as health delivery, 
education, and transport continue to operate normally. 
  The foreign minister, whose visit is the first to Africa 
since he was appointed nine months ago, said Cuba has had to 
face the difficulties with a lot of hard work. He said the 
efforts and sacrifices of Cubans over the years have started 
yielding positive results. 
  Mr. Robaina said the existing bonds of friendship between 
Cuba and Ghana are very healthy and that he is here to put 
Cuba's case across. He said what Cuba expects from Ghana now is 
an increase in the level of cooperation in all areas of mutual 
interest. 
  On Cuba's foreign policy, Mr. Robaina said his government is 
taking steps to adopt a new policy to meet the changing times. 
The delegation was met on arrival by the foreign minister and 
acting attorney general, Dr. Obed Asamoah. From Ghana, it will 
go on to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia.

  [Text] United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia 
[ULIMO] fighters on 5-6 January mistakenly attacked the Guinean 
town of Macenta, 820 km south of Conakry, the capital. The 
attack is said to have left several victims, and the Guinean 
Army was dispatched to the spot. From Conakry Ben Daouda Sylla 
has more details: 
  [Begin Sylla recording] The incident on 5-6 January in the 
town of Macenta, situated 820 km to the south, seems to be a 
reprisal against the (Konyianke) ethnic group, which makes up 
the majority of the ULIMO fighters. A week ago, ULIMO 
mistakenly attacked and decimated a group of Tooma tribesmen 
from Macenta, who had gathered for an initiation ceremony in a 
sacred forest near a border village. Some eyewitnesses say that 
this village was Niaguerazou, in the northwest of the 
prefecture. Persons contacted by telephone Thursday night gave 
contradictory figures concerning the dead ranging from two to a 
dozen. The incident reportedly occurred in the center of the 
town, with some houses being burnt down -- including that of the 
mayor of Macenta. 
  Reinforcements sent from Conakry, Dikedoue, and Nzerekore 
reportedly have brought the situation under control, and persons 
from the border areas of Zimi, Taourou, and [words indistinct] 
have been tracked down. [end recording]

  [Text] Conakry, Jan 7 (AFP) -- A Liberian armed faction 
slaughtered about 20 Guinean traders in cross-border raids on 
their villages in the Macenta district of southern Guinea, 
authoritative sources said here Friday [7 January]. 
  Members of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO) attacked 
three villages on December 20, killing traders they accused of 
supplying their rivals of the National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia (NPFL), the sources said. 
  Questioned by AFP from Dakar, Guinean Interior Minister 
Alseny Rene Gomez confirmed "the existence of trouble" along the 
border, but declined to give any casualty toll. 
  Almost all those killed were Malinkes, but the minister said 
the massacre had nothing to do with "an ethnic problem or a 
political problem" among Guineans following a presidential 
election here. 
  Alpha Conde, Guinea's main opposition leader, who is a 
Malinke, also said there was no question of ethnic strife among 
Guineans. 
  "These are ULIMO men who once again have made incursions 
into 
Guinea, killing Guineans they accuse of cooperating with (NPFL 
leader) Charles Taylor," he said. 
  Guinean officials have also accused the NPFL of launching 
punitive raids into Guinean territory to kill traders they 
accuse of supporting ULIMO. 
  Both ULIMO and the NPFL are, with the Armed Forces of 
Liberia, the army of assassinated President Samuel Doe, 
signatories to a peace and disarmament accord reached in Benin 
in July after more than three years of civil war. 
  In a separate development, a first contingent of 173 Ugandan 
soldiers arrived in the Liberian capital Monrovia on Friday, to 
join the Nigerian-led ECOMOG peacekeeping force first sent to 
the war-torn country by other West African states in 1990. 
  They immediately went on to the iron-ore port of Buchanan, 
90 
kilometres (55 miles) east of Monrovia, where their headquarters 
will be established. 
  More than 600 soldiers from Tanzania have arrived in Liberia 
since December 23 under a plan to reinforce ECOMOG with some 
2,55O soldiers from Uganda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, bringing the 
force's total strength to 19,000.

  [Text] Niamey, 7 Jan (AFP) -- The Niger Government decided 
this evening to close down the Niamey University "until further 
notice" and called on its occupants "to vacate" the campus, 
following incidents between the students and security forces. 
Speaking on national television, Education Minister Djibo Garba 
also stated that 58 people were picked up for interrogation and 
"about 30" injured without specifying whether they were students 
or policemen. Eighteen vehicles were ransacked or burned down. 
A previous report of the police said that about 50 students 
were picked, including "some union leaders," and more than 40 
slightly injured. 
  The incidents started yesterday, late in the afternoon, when 
the police dispersed a demonstration of some 500 students in 
downtown Niamey. The demonstrators, who were demanding the 
payment of seven to nine months scholarship arrears and 
improvement of their working conditions, withdrew early in the 
evening to the campus, where they were surrounded by the 
security forces. At 2200, local time, that is 2100 GMT, about 
500 policemen, gendarmes, and republican guards, were still near 
the university, according to an AFP correspondent. 
  The minister of education further stated that the government 
was about to investigate the affair in order "to prosecute those 
behind the demonstration."

  [Text] Lagos, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Nigerian troops have been 
deployed along the border with Cameroon following border 
incidents in which six people were reported to have been killed, 
Defence Ministry spokesman General Fred Chijuka said Friday. 
  The troops were on Nigerian territory and had no 
"expansionist" intentions, he added, explaining that the aim was 
to show local people that they had not been abandoned by the 
authorities. 
  Press reports said that last week Cameroonian paramilitary 
police carried out a raid against Abana fishing village in Cross 
River state, killing six people. Six women have been reported 
missing since. 
  THE GUARDIAN newspaper, citing sources close to the security 
forces, said the Cameroonian gendarmes threw the baby child of 
one of the villagers into the water after she said she did not 
have to pay them money they had demanded. 
  Fourteen fishing vessels were sunk during the raid, the 
independent newspaper said.

maintenance at the Kaduna and Warri Refineries. The minister of 
petroleum and mineral resources, Chief Don Etiebet, said in

full capacity level. He expressed concern over the current 
low-level of petroleum products being produced by the Kaduna and 
Warri Refineries. The minister directed the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, to terminate all contracts for the 
lifting of crude oil by customers. New contracts for the 
lifting of the oil will take effect on 1 March this year.

  [Excerpts] Togolese are still in shock from the aggression 
against their country on the night of 5 to 6 January. Calm has 
gradually been returning in the last few hours in Lome following 
the mopping-up operation carried out by the Togolese security 
forces, the last gunshots of which were heard this morning. 
However, Lome Inhabitants are still reluctant to go out. They 
can be found in small groups in front of their houses listening 
to transistor radios. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the attack, armed elements from Ghana last night 
around 2250 GMT shot at Togolese security forces on duty at the 
main border crossing at Aflao. The charge d'affaires of Ghana 
in Togo, contacted by the minister of foreign affairs, promised 
to contact the Ghanaian authorities in order to end this 
flagrant act of aggression against our country. With the 
persistence of shooting, the Togolese Government, calling on the 
international community to bear witness, called on Ghana to stop 
such acts. Since then shooting has actually stopped at the 
Aflao border point. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lome 7 Jan (AFP) -- The Gendarmerie in Lome 
announced today that clashes which have occurred in Lome since 
the evening of 5 January between security forces and groups of 
armed men, have resulted in 42 dead, with about 60 suspects 
arrested. The number of people injured has not yet been 
established, the Gendarmerie added. A previous official report 
stated that 40 people had been killed and 35 arrested. 
  According to Togolese authorities, these armed men have 
"come 
from neighboring Ghana" with the aim of killing or capturing the 
head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema. 
  From circles close to the presidency, it is asserted that 
these "aggressors" are members of the opposition in exile, and 
have enjoyed the support of the Ghanaian civilian and military 
authorities. These accusations have been denied by the 
government in Accra. 
  According to the Gendarmerie, among the dead are 29 
"terrorists," eight members of the security forces, and five 
civilians, one of them a Brazilian pastor who was on a visit to 
the capital. He was killed in the evening of 5 January while 
driving his vehicle. His identity has not been specified. 
  On the other hand, military sources have reported that 
during 
last night's attack on the border post between Lome and the 
bordering Ghanaian town of Aflao, eight members of the security 
forces had been injured. 
  Reporters -- including an AFP correspondent -- who were able 
to visit the post, noted that although the building had not been 
destroyed it had been riddled with bullet and rocket holes. All 
the windows were smashed and broken water pipes had flooded it 
with water. 
  The area near the police post is littered with casings and 
broken shells. No Ghanaian military forces were to be seen on 
the other side of the border. About 300 meters away from the 
border some civilians apparently were observing the situation. 
  Very close to the border on the Togolese side, some dozens 
of 
soldiers and gendarmes were in position -- some of them on board 
machinegun carriers and others buried in trenches or hidden in 
neighboring houses. 
  At the Gendarmerie camp near downtown Lome, reporters were 
able to meet with seven of those arrested. Among them were 
three young Ghanaians who asserted that they were traders, and 
that they had not in any way taken part in the attacks. 
  The four others, who are Togolese, admitted their 
participation in the attacks, stating that they had "shot into 
the air." Only one of them appeared to be injured -- he had a 
broken lip and a gash on the chin. 
  They stated that they were trained in camps located in 
Ghanaian territory, at Viepe and Gagodope, not far from Aflao. 
They named Kakouvi Massemeh, minister of interior in the first 
Togolese transition government from 1991 to 1992, as their 
"leader." They explained that they had infiltrated themselves 
into the country in plainclothes and unarmed early this week. 
In Lome, shortly before the beginning of the 5 January 
operation, they received their weapons, ammunition, and 
instructions from accomplices: "To catch Eyadema, dead or 
alive." 
  The Gendarmerie also exhibited to newsmen six vehicles, two 
all-purpose vehicles, and four minibuses which, according to the 
authorities, had been used by the "terrorists." All had on 
their wind screens a self-adhesive tag bearing two triangles -- 
red and white -- superposed top to bottom like the Star of David. 
  One of the four-wheel drive vehicles was equipped with a 
canvas made of sown sack cloth and bearing the initials HCR, 
that is, UN High Commission for Refugees. 
  Among the equipment seized were AK-47 rifles, ammunition, 
and 
magazines, anti-tank rocket launchers, fatigues, cutlasses, 
torch lights, and ...charms. Calm prevailed this afternoon in 
the streets of Lome, which is still under heavy security guard. 
  Western embassies have instructed their nationals to remain 
indoors excerpt in case of circumstances beyond their control. 
  The 81 French soldiers, who arrived in the country early 
this 
week to participate in the supervision of the legislative 
elections slated for next month, are stationed at the 
Inter-African Military Academy of Administration, whose 
buildings are close to those of the Presidency.

ward located in the northwestern suburb of the Togolese capital, 
destroying a house and seriously wounding his owner.

  [Text] Tension between Togo and Ghana has increased again 
today following Wednesday [5 January] evening's deadly attack 
against the Lome inter-army regiment which houses president 
Eyadema's residence. 
  Earlier today on our station, the Togolese foreign minister 
accused the Ghanaian authorities of being passive accomplices; 
he said that the attack is coming from Ghana, from a commando 
operating from this country. He added that Ghana had also 
become a rear base for the forces of the opposition leader, 
Gilchrist Olympio. To say he is not involved is nonsensical, 
concluded the Togolese foreign minister. 
  Ghana strongly denies any involvement in this case, saying 
that Lome has no evidence whatsoever. As for the opposition 
leader, Gilchrist Olympio, who was directly accused, he did not 
take long to react to what Ouattara Natachaba said: 
  [Begin recording] [Olympio] We believe that the statement by 
Natachaba is particularly irresponsible. We have always said 
that Togo is very sick, and the national tissue is in the 
process of disintegration. What we need is not recriminations, 
but a genuine roundtable, gathering all the parties at the local 
level and our foreign mediators, particularly France, Germany, 
and the United States. Therefore, I would say that the violence 
we are witnessing at the moment was expected. 
  [Repoter Assan Diop] So Mr. Olympio, you reject the 
accusation of being responsible for this action by a commando on 
5 January? 
  [Olympio] Absolutely! We reject it categorically and add 
that we deeply regret the shedding of blood. [end recording]

<F P=106> [New conference by Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh with </F>
unidentified reporters on 7 January in Lome -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Koffigoh] I would like to tell the Togolese 
people that normal activities will resume soon in Lome in a few 
hours or days. As for the attacks themselves, all Togolese are 
deeply shocked -- the head of state, my government and myself -- 
we are all indignant at what happened, and we believe that the 
attacks are absurd and antidemocratic because we are on the way 
to the legislative elections that will complete the democratic 
process in Togo. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Concerning these attacks, there is a 
neighboring country that is being accused of the attacks. What 
can you say about Togo's relations with that country? 
  [Koffigoh] Togo wants to live in peace with all the 
countries of the subregion. You know that Togo has signed a 
nonaggression pact with three countries in the subregion: 
Ghana, Benin and Nigeria. Moreover, we are united within the 
Economic Community of West African States. We want to live in 
peace with all the countries of the subregion -- and this should 
be clear once and for all. As for the head of state and the 
Togolese Government, every effort will be made to preserve this 
peaceful atmosphere. 
  It is true that on 6 January, at the border post at Aflao, 
our security forces fired upon from Ghana. The government 
lodged complaints and during the night, we obtained from the 
Ghanaian Government a statement assuring us that Ghana has no 
intention of attacking Togo -- we have taken note of that. But 
we believe that words alone are not enough, and that attitudes 
should be similar to declarations of intention. Once again: 
Togo wants to live in peace with all the countries in the 
subregion. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you were in 
discussions with the head of state when the attacks took place. 
This did not prevent you from rounding up your discussions and 
deciding to postpone by two weeks the date of the legislative 
election. What are the reasons behind this postponement? 
  [Koffigoh] There are two reasons for this postponement. 
First, there are technical reasons. You know that it is the 
National Electoral Commission that is in charge of personalizing 
the voter's cards and their distribution. There was a slight 
delay in that process. [passage omitted] The second reason is 
political. We want to lead our people on the path to democracy, 
and the government and the head of state remain open and 
attentive to all suggestions, regardless of where they come 
from, so that together and within the framework of the policy of 
democratic integration we promised to initiate -- right from the 
beginning -- we will get to the finishing line of the democratic 
process. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, with regard to 
the other politicians, do you think, do you believe that this 
two week-delay will win over the total and final commitment of 
the opposition parties? 
  [Koffigoh] You know, the role of the opposition is not to 
always agree with the choice of the government. Therefore, 
there will always be some people who say no to all decisions we 
make. [passage omitted] But we think that some candidates and 
political groups engaged in this electoral process will approve 
of our decision. There will always be some people who say no. 
But this is part of the nature and essence of democracy, to 
accept and to tolerate the word no. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, what message do 
you have for the Togolese people? 
  [Koffigoh] My message is always a message of hope and peace. 
The situation prevailing in Togo -- though serious -- is not 
desperate. All the signs for hope are there to see. We have 
elected a head of state. We are now going to a legislative 
election that will enable us to clear the Togolese political 
scene. We will soon have a parliament. All elements will be 
gathered to set up new institutions. Our law-abiding state will 
therefore be better guaranteed and we shall commit ourselves to 
succeed in what constitutes the challenge of this end of 
century, both for Togo and the other African countries -- that 
is, the challenge of economic reconstruction. 
  We have succeeded in preserving our country from falling 
apart by preventing Togo from waging a civil war; we have 
succeeded in preserving the economic infrastructure of our 
country; and we have our two hands to work with. We have our 
heads to think with; we have common objectives; we have common 
interests to defend; we have our national unity to safeguard; we 
have peace to restore, our economy to revamp, and an integral 
democratic process to achieve. We finally have -- and it is 
always useful to stress this -- a platform for consultation. 
Currently, we have the International Monitoring Commission -- 
we all agreed to its creation and it is there to bring together 
different points of view. We have the National Electoral 
Commission and a Parity Commission that are expected to fulfill 
their tasks. The government has agreed to initiate dialogue 
with all political parties, and I can assure you that things 
will get moving because government delegates have already met 
with opposition delegates. 
  Therefore, the situation prevailing in Togo is difficult but 
it is not desperate. You know that the government has made the 
necessary efforts to begin the payment of salary arrears. The 
Togolese have celebrated the end of the year 1993 in joy and 
they are beginning 1994 in happiness. Despite all this some 
marginal citizens do not share the ideals of democracy we 
initiated and that we have striven to implement since the start. 
But to them also, and because they are our brothers, we say 
come on in, come to join us in the train of democracy for the 
best interest of all.

<F P=106> [Government statement issued in Lome on 8 January; read by </F>
Benjamin Komlan Agbeka, minister of communication and culture -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Following the attacks perpetrated on 5 and 6 January 
on our capital, and following the attempt by terrorists 
recruited and trained abroad and heavily armed, with the aim of 
assassinating the head of state, the government, in the supreme 
interest of the nation, took some security measures which led to 
a lull in the socioeconomic activities in the city of Lome and 
its environs. This attack was also aimed at jeopardizing the 
democratic process; at hampering the holding of the legislative 
elections; and at paralyzing economic activities whose effective 
resumption has started to cause some concern to the enemies of 
the Togolese people. 
  The government is happy at the failure of the attempt to 
assassinate the head of state, and expresses to him its deep 
gratitude for his invaluable contribution for the restoration of 
peace and security in the country. As of now, the security 
forces, through their courageous and efficient action, have put 
to flight the attackers and restored order and security in the 
country. The government warmly congratulates the Togolese Armed 
Forces, the National Gendarmery, the national police, and 
keepers of the territorial security for their courage and their 
loyalty. It also congratulates the Togolese people in general 
and those of Lome and its environs in particular for their calm, 
discipline, and contribution to the restoration of peace. 
  Following these painful events which plunged the Togolese 
people into mourning, the government expresses its compassion to 
the bereaved families and wishes a quick recovery to those 
wounded. Order and security have been restored, and the 
government is calling on the people of Lome and its environs to 
go about their normal business beginning today, Saturday, 8 
January. 
  However, in order to consolidate peace and tranquility, the 
curfew will remain in force from 2100 to 0500 in Lome and its 
environs, beginning today, Saturday, 8 January. Finally, the 
government has decided to reopen the northern and eastern land 
borders. Western land borders remains closed until further 
notice. 
  Issued: Lome, 8 January. 
  [Signed] The Government

  [Text] The Togolese have always demonstrated their 
devotion to their daily activities. From the primary sector to 
the tertiary sector through the secondary sector, they have 
always sought to develop their country's economy, thanks to 
peace and concord installed for more than a quarter of a century 
in Togo. This is why, taking advantage of the calm situation 
since this morning, in the aftermath of the painful events in 
Lome in recent days, the people of Lome have not hesitated to 
gradually resume their normal activities. Some vehicles and 
motorcycles, as well as pedestrians, have started going about 
the city. 
  These people, however, have to obey the injunctions of the 
security forces who, for their part, are still trying to 
dislodge the last terrorists still in hiding after their deadly 
act. The official balance sheet for this attack yesterday stood 
at 58 dead, after the discovery of 16 more bodies. It will be 
recalled that yesterday, the National Gendarmery presented the 
arrested terrorists to the national and international press. 
The statements they made pointed to the fact that they all 
received military training in neighboring Ghana, and that their 
mission was to arrest or to kill the head of state, General 
Gnassingbe Eyadema, and then later to cause panic within the 
peaceful population of Lome and its environs. 
  It will also be recalled that the head of the government, 
Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, yesterday in a press statement deplored 
the attack on the Togolese people. The prime minister also 
spoke of Togo's desire to live in peace, in particular with its 
neighbors. He stated that himself, President Eyadema, and the 
government will do everything possible to preserve this peace, 
which is so dear to the whole of Togo.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Today, opposition parties issued their first 
reaction to Wednesday [5 January]'s attack on the main military 
base in Lome, Togo's capital. Since then, there has been a war 
of words across the border between Togo and Ghana. Togo says 
the attack was launched by dissidents based in Ghana. The 
Ghanaian Government denies any involvement and says the Togolese 
forces shelled Ghanaian territory. Now, as Ebow Godwin reports 
from Lome, one of the opposition parties based in Togo is 
insisting it had nothing to do with the attack: 
  [Begin Godwin recording] According to the Action Committee 
for Renewal led by Lawyer Yaovi Agboyibor, the latest act of 
violence against Togo was totally undemocratic and certainly not 
in the best interest of the majority of the Togolese people. 
They said and I quote, we all reservedly condemn the latest 
armed attack, no matter where it comes from, because it is 
undemocratic, unquote. The party, therefore, appeals to the 
government to take immediate measures to restore the situation 
in Togo back to normalcy in order to create the right atmosphere 
for holding the forthcoming parliamentary elections. 
  The coordinating body of the New Political Forces, which is 
an amalgamation of several opposition parties seeking to create 
a balance of power between the traditional opposition groups and 
President Eyadema, also described the armed attack as a 
deliberate conspiration meant to reverse the move toward the 
attainment of parliamentary democracy in Togo. A spokesman for 
the group, Ephrem Dokenou, accused selfish people who were 
unhappy about the return of peace and political stability in 
Togo of trying to throw Togo once more into a state of chaos and 
insecurity. The New Political Forces emphasized that Togo 
already has a credible political program in place, having 
already conducting presidential elections last August. The New 
Forces recalled that currently an international committee, 
comprising France, Germany, United States of America, and Egypt, 
were engaged in helping both the opposition groups and President 
Eyadema organize free and fair multiparty parliamentary 
elections. He said, and I quote, those who want to create chaos 
under the pretext that Togo has no credible political program 
must look elsewhere, unquote. 
  However, the Group of [Pan-African] Social Democrats, GSP, 
led by Professor Messan Gnininvi, Antoine Folly, and Zarifou 
Ayeva, denied allegations currently being made in certain 
quarters that their group, which was boycotting the forthcoming 
parliamentary elections, was behind the recent armed attack. 
Our hands are clean, the group declared. [end recording]

  [Text] Lome, 8 Jan (AFP) -- The two main Togolese 
opposition parties, Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy 
[UTD] and Yao Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], 
today called on the government to "reconsider extending the 
postponement" of the legislative elections in view of the recent 
violence which, according to official tallies, has claimed 58 
lives in Lome. 
  On 6 January, the government announced a two-week 
postponement of the elections because of the "delay in making 
certain material arrangements, especially the preparation and 
distribution of individual voter's cards." The elections are 
now scheduled to take place on 6 and 20 February. 
  "The new dates must be revised because there have been 
several days of blockage," Mr. Kodjo told AFP, adding that "any 
further action will depend on how the government resolves the 
current security problem which may create obstacles in the 
pre-electoral period." 
  Meanwhile, "the CAR has taken note of the government's 
decision to postpone the election by 15 days to allow better 
preparations for the legislative elections," but it "deplores 
the fact that the delay is taking effect at a time when all 
sectors of the country are paralized." Answering questions by 
AFP, Mr. Agboyibor said that "the bodies set up to organize the 
elections cannot profitably use the new delay." 
  The radical opposition has already reiterated its decision 
to 
boycott the legislative elections despite the postponement. 
Leopold Gnininvi of the Group of Pan-African Social Democrats, 
a three-party coalition, and Antoine Folly of the Union for 
Democracy and Solidarity believe that "the postponement 
announced does in no way improve the situation: It neither 
restores the rule of law nor creates conditions for equitable 
elections."

  [Text] Three top rebel commanders of the RUF [Revolutionary 
United Front] have been killed during an attack at Koidu and 
(Bentenjema Yawa) by government troops. This was disclosed by 
Brigade Commander Brigadier Joe Turay in an interview with SLENA 
[SIERRA LEONE NEWS AGENCY]. Brig. Joe Turay gave the names of 
the three commanders as Mohamed Barry, field commander; Joseph 
Brown, the chief of personnel; and the said commando Mosquito. 
He said the field commander, Mohamed Barry, and Joseph Brown, 
the chief of personnel were killed three days ago during an 
attack at Koidu when the rebels were repelled by government 
troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Conte of 
the 3d Battalion. 
  Brig. Joe Turay further stated that government troops also 
recovered documents including a map of Guinea which the then 
commanders were carrying, indicating a planned attack on Guinea. 
He added that a large cache of arms and ammunition were also 
discovered at (Tamapondo) village along the Sierra Leone-Guinea 
border during their patrol. The arms and ammunition included 
bazookas and anti-aircraft double-barrel guns, rocket-propelled 
grenades, AK-47 and 57 rifles, Beretta rifles, and communication 
sets. 
  Meanwhile, Brig. Joe Turay has assured all that with the 
expiration of the cease-fire, government troops are now poised 
to launch a full-scale offensive against Foday Sankoh's RUF 
bandits.

  [Text] The world in general, and Angolans in particular, 
continue to center their attention on the peace talks between 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola and the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party. 
Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say the two sides today tackled 
technical aspects on the formation of a new national police. 
Today's session was attended by the observers and the mediator. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Lusaka say the meeting of military 
chiefs of both sides, which was scheduled for the Sao Tomean 
capital today, will only take place if an accord is reached in 
the Zambian capital.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura is hopeful 
about the peace accord to be reached in Lusaka. The Angolan 
minister has returned to Luanda from a visit to the United 
States. In New York he handed a letter from President Eduardo 
dos Santos to the UN secretary general. The letter expressed 
hope in the talks in Zambia and gave an account of the situation 
in Angola. Lidia Cristo reports. 
  [Cristo] Venancio de Moura is optimistic. The Angolan 
Government believes an Angolan peace accord will be reached soon. 
  [begin de Moura recording] We are hopeful that an agreement 
will soon be reached in Lusaka, which can then be signed to 
conclude the negotiations. A day will be chosen, we can call it 
D-day, to proclaim a cease-fire, not a unilateral cease-fire as 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
has publicized and which has never existed, but an effective and 
overall cease- fire, that is, covering the whole country. [end

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Joao Ligio] </F>
  [Excerpt] After five days of talks in Lusaka, Zambia, there 
has still been no progress toward peace. The point under 
discussion continues to be the formation of the national police. 
Today is Sunday, a day of rest, and Lusaka II observed the day 
as such. The delegations spent the day in different ways. 
While the government delegation used the break to coordinate 
its principles, UNITA met with U.S. congressmen at Victoria 
Falls, near the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
  At about 1000 tomorrow a new plenary session will take place 
at the Mulungushi Conference Center. The government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have 
already made their [words indistinct]. The session will center 
on memoranda of intentions from the two parties, which Alioune 
Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, failed to 
bring closer during the beginning of Lusaka II talks. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Statements by Alberto Neto, president of the Angolan </F>
Democratic Party; Milton Kilandamoko, president of the Angolan 
Social Democratic Party; and Paulino Pinto Joao, president of 
the Angolan National Democratic Convention -- place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] The opposition parties have been talking about the 
need for peace. Certain leaders, notably Alberto Neto, 
president of the Angolan Democratic Party, PDA, have expressed 
the belief that they should be present at the talks in Lusaka. 
  [Begin Neto recording] (?There is talk) that peace will be 
achieved by any means. Let us add that, to that end, there must 
be trust and dialogue. Dialogue is something which is already 
happening, so there is the need to do away with lack of trust 
now. This is why we believe that other civilian political 
parties, including the PDA, should be attending the Lusaka peace 
talks or other subsequent talks so we can contribute toward 
peace and national reconciliation, as stated in the Law on 
Political Parties and in the Angolan Constitution. National 
reconciliation cannot be achieved by two political forces alone. 
[end recording] 
  The following is what Milton Kilandamoko, president of the 
Angolan Social Democratic Party, PSDA, said: 
  [Begin Kilandamoko recording] In principle, we (?believe the 
talks will lead) to a cease-fire accord that will end 
hostilities and that will allow us to return to our normal 
lives, so that we can really turn to thinking about national 
unity. [end recording] 
  Paulino Pinto Joao, president of the Angolan National 
Democratic Convention, CNDA, made the following comment: 
  [Begin Joao recording] There is a clear need for achieving 
an 
agreement in Lusaka: First of all, because the Angolan people do 
not want war any more. We all aspire to peace and that is our 
message to our brethren negotiating in Lusaka at this stage. 
Second, because democracy is not achieved through war. To make 
democracy, there has to be peace. People must accept and 
tolerate differences so they can look for areas of consensus 
concerning solutions to the nation's problems. [end recording]

  [Text] Lusaka continues to be the target of our attention 
and our hopes. The peace talks resumed there earlier this week, 
but they continue to be unproductive. The negotiators have 
reached yet another weekend and must now wait for next week. 
Our correspondent Joao Ligio had this to report by telephone: 
  [Begin Ligio recording] UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye has not yet decided to give up, even after 
yesterday's failure to bring the two sides closer together. 
This suggests that Beye may be trying to devise a new plan to 
bring the two sides together. So far, the work has continued to 
concentrated on unfinished documents, both from the two warring 
sides and from the mediators. As far as we have been able to 
observe, there is still much to do: the national police must 
still be given the status of a civilian institution. The crux 
of the matter is whether it will be a military or paramilitary 
institution. This is one of the many differences preventing 
harmony reigning at the proceedings. 
  This is the first hurdle that the UN special representative 
must overcome. The mediators have already identified the 
problem and hope to act accordingly when talks resume on 10 
January. It is hoped that, after four days in Lusaka, the 
negotiators will again meet face to face on that day. It is not 
an exaggeration to say that slowness appears to be the motto of 
the talks. Between good morning and good afternoon greetings, 
we do our best to obtain fresh information. The result is 
always the same: nothing. But that is not what happens with 
some foreign media here. The announced meeting between the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team 
and U.S. congressmen has not taken place yet, but UNITA sources 
have repeatedly said that it may occur before the next 
face-to-face meeting between the warring sides. [end recording]

  [Text] The main and sole objective in Lusaka, Zambia, is to 
find peace for Angola. This morning the delegation from the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] held 
a meeting with the mediators. We do not yet know the reasons 
and the results of this meeting, because of the press censorship 
imposed by Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special 
representative in Angola, at the beginning of the peace talks 
last December. 
  All the same, it is known that the parties are discussing 
the 
formation of the new national police, national reconciliation, 
the future UN role in Angola, the release of prisoners, the 
sharing of power, and the second round of presidential 
elections. The talks will continue tomorrow.

  [Text] While peace negotiations continue in Lusaka, in 
Angola the reality is different. National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces have shelled the northeast 
part of the city of Cuito, capital of Bie Province, causing 10 
deaths and seriously wounding others. Our correspondent Abel 
Abreu reports from the area: 
  The government forces -- firm and decided as always -- have 
repelled yet another attack by UNITA forces. The dead were 
buried in several cemeteries across the city, and silence, pain, 
hatred, and indignation were reflected in the faces of the 
mourning family and friends who accompanied the bodies in 
funeral processions.

  [Text] The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] 
Military Command of the northern Bengo Province today disclosed 
in a communique that the air force of the government of Eduardo 
dos Santos, the unelected president, bombed the (Zembos) and 
(Pangualuquene) areas between 5 and 7 January, using toxic 
chemicals. The communique, reported by Otavio Mulembe, Voice of 
the Resistance of the Black Cockerel journalist, says that the 
Luanda government has used SU-25 aircraft to bomb the area, 
killing three people -- two children and a woman. Dozens 
civilians were seriously affected by gases coming from the 
explosion. 
  The communique also reveals that People's Armed Forces for 
the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] personnel, estimated at four 
infantry brigades and one motorized brigade, have begun yet 
another offensive to capture the city of Uige. The document 
says there are two groups, one moving along the right bank of 
Benge River through Nambuangongo, and the second is following 
the left bank of Benge River, passing through Ndalatando and 
Ucua with the intention of going to Uige. The patriotic and 
revolutionary FALA military command in the area alerts the 
international community and the United Nations to the danger 
such adventure may represent to Angola, and particularly to its 
negotiating process. 
  The communique stresses that FALA is ready to adhere 
scrupulously to the unilateral cease-fire, but will never accept 
provocations, wherever they come from. It appeals to the 
residents to remain vigilant and calm, because FALA knows how to 
defend the people.

  [Text] The Angolan UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] rebel group has allegedly bayonetted to 
death 170 civilians in the northern district of Calulo. A local 
government official says the killings took place over the past 
two weeks. Those killed were apparently accused of being 
traitors and government supporters. Several hundred people have 
fled the region and 18 people from Calulo have died of hunger.

  [Text] The minister of state in the Office of the 
President, Honorable John Tembo, has denied allegations printed 
in today's edition of THE MONITOR newspaper that an intelligence 
unit of the Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] which used to operate at 
(Seramara) in Blantyre is now operating from (Jaya) building 
where his offices are. 
  Reacting to the article at a special press conference, Hon. 
Tembo expressed concern that the author of the article did not 
confirm the allegations before publication. He added that the 
allegation was baseless. The minister explained that he has 
never commanded any unit of the MYP and that it was impossible 
for such an intelligence unit to operate from his offices, where 
he said were small. [as heard] 
  The managing director of THE MONITOR newspaper Mr. Clement 
Tambul has acknowledged the concern expressed by Hon. Tembo, but 
pointed out that his paper has had problems in the past in 
contacting the minister on issues affecting him for 
clarifications.

  [Text] The Malawi police has refuted an article which 
appeared in the MIRROR newspaper of Thursday this week that 
alleged that a police camp at Mchinji was attacked by Malawi 
Young Pioneers, MYP, operating from Mozambique last month. 
  A spokesman of the National Police Headquarters in Lilongwe 
said today that the article alleged that members of the MYP, 
operating from Mozambique, on the (?21st) December 1993 at dawn 
attacked the police mobile force (?Yellow) Camp in Mchinji and 
killed 12 mobile policemen. The spokesman said the article does 
not say any grain of truth, as it is baseless and unfounded. 
The spokesman said he views the article as an act of 
irresponsible reporting, which he said might incite undesirable 
situations and can be detrimental to the lives of Malawians.

  [Text] Blantyre, Jan 9 (AFP) -- The Malawi and Mozambique 
defence ministers hold a one-day meeting Monday aimed at 
resolving the fate of a number of armed Malawi Young Pioneers 
[MYP] who fled to Mozambique last month. 
  A senior Malawi Government official told AFP Mozambican 
Defence Minister Alberto Chipande will head his country's 
eight-man delegation to the talks. 
  Malawi's Minister of State John Tembo, who with Chipande is 
co-chairman of the Joint Defence and Security Commission of 
Mozambique and Malawi, will head the Malawi team. 
  The Pioneers were forced to flee their homes and bases when 
Malawi Army soldiers began disarming them, in retaliation 
against the shooting dead of two soldiers in northern Malawi 
last month by the Pioneers. 
  The two countries have not established the number of armed 
pioneers in Mozambique, although unofficial figures say up to 
1,000 of the 1,500 members of the armed wing of the Pioneers 
could have fled to Mozambique. 
  "We are not talking about numbers. We are anxious to resolve 
this matter because it is the Mozambicans who raised the 
question of armed Pioneers in their country," said the Malawi 
Government official. 
  President Kamuzu Banda, who established the Pioneers as an 
armed wing of his ruling Malawi Congress party and his personal 
army, announced January 1 that the two neighbouring countries 
would meet to discuss the issue. 
  "We are anxious to have them safely in Malawi," said Banda, 
whose constant call for the Pioneers to return and hand over 
weapons to the Army or police has been ignored by the Pioneers.

  [Excerpts] Vicente Ululu, secretary general of the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], said that Renamo leader 
Afonso Dhlakama is expected to visit Portugal during the second 
half of this month. Ululu told NOTICIAS that he received the 
information from a Renamo branch in Lisbon, which said that the 
Portuguese Foreign Ministry had sent an invitation for a 
Dhlakama visit to the Renamo Office in Maputo. He said that "so 
far, we (Renamo) have not received an official invitation from 
the Portuguese Government. We shall reply as soon as we receive 
the invitation." 
  Asked to comment on the objectives of Dhlakama's visit to 
Portugal, Vicente Ululu said his movement was interested in 
briefing European countries about the steps being taken in the 
process of pacification and democratization of the country. 
  Ululu said: As you are aware, the peace process is 
progressing satisfactorily. At the moment we are sending our 
guerrilla forces to assembly points throughout the country. 
Some of these troops will join the Mozambique Defense Armed 
Forces, while others will be demobilized. All these steps show 
that the process is progressing smoothly. [passage omitted] 
  The Renamo leader is also expected to visit Spain and the 
United States, although senior Renamo officials declined to 
comment on that report. 
  The Renamo secretary general also told NOTICIAS that he does 
not exclude the possibility of his leader "visiting Tanzania, 
Zambia, and Namibia, in the coming days." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jose de Castro, head of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] foreign affairs department, is currently on 
a tour of the country. At this stage he is in northern 
Mozambique. While in Zambezia Province, Jose de Castro told 
Radio Mozambique that his tour involved choosing Renamo 
representatives to the National Elections Commission, among 
other things. 
  Approximately one week after Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama 
visited the city of Quelimane, the capital of Zambezia Province 
-- saying the people had shown their (?gratitude) and given a 
vote of confidence in his party -- is once again the stage for 
yet another working visit by high ranking officials in the 
[words indistinct] of the Mozambican Government. Renamo Foreign 
Affairs Chief Jose de Castro has been in Quelimane on what he 
described as a working visit and [words indistinct] General 
Peace Accord, concerning verification of the formation of 
Zambezia Province Elections Commission. 
  Asked by our reporters whether the people who had taken him 
to Quelimane were linked to the formation of the aforesaid 
commission, that Renamo official said that another reason for 
his visit to Quelimane concerned the fact that the Renamo 
delegate has not been given an official residence. Castro also 
noted that work (?has been slow) to rehabilitate the building 
which will serve as the party's headquarters in Zambezia 
Province [words indistinct] that Renamo official also expressed 
concern about the fact that his movement's troops are being 
confined only in one of the assembly points in the province. He 
said that Renamo's troops have been assembling rather slowly 
because they do not have transportation and he added that the 
government has been making much out of it to dramatize the 
situation. 
  Just as Afonso Dhlakama pointed out in several speeches in 
the province, the Renamo foreign affairs chief reaffirmed there 
will never be war in the country again. Another noteworthy 
point which came up in the interview he granted our reporters 
was the fact that Indian and Portuguese citizens are being 
detained in Renamo's (Mongola), in Zambezia Province's Milange 
District. Castro said he knew nothing about it and he added 
that matter is the responsibility of Renamo's internal 
administration. He noted, however, that such matters are often 
handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
ICRC, which takes the detainees to Malawi; from there they are 
returned to their countries. 
  After criticizing the fact that the provincial government 
had 
not made it possible for him to meet the provincial governor and 
that it had hampered the normal rehabilitation of Renamo's 
future provincial headquarters, Jose de Castro accused the 
Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, government of deliberately 
seeking to jeopardize peace when it made an attempt on Renamo 
leader Afonso Dhlakama's life in Nampula.

  [Text] Domingos Antonio Vargas, adviser of Mozambique 
National Resistance's [Renamo] secretary general and the 
treasury, has abandoned the party because of fear for his life 
and splits within the organization. Vargas, 22, was abducted by 
Afonso Dhlakama's movement in central Mozambique in 1988. He 
said he left Renamo on 4 July 1993 and since then has been 
living under the protection of friends and acquaintances in 
Maputo. 
  Speaking in Maputo to the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, Raul 
Domingos said Vargas is Mozambique Liberation Front spy and a 
thief. He added: Vargas has stolen over $300,000. Raul 
Domingos, who is head of Renamo's delegation to the Cease-Fire 
Commission, said there could be other spies in the organization, 
but he promised to thwart their activities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economic Upswing in Sight"] </F>
  [Text] Attempts to create a favorable investment climate in 
Namibia have created very promising economic prospects for the 
next two years and beyond, according to the minister of Trade 
and Industry, Mr. Hidipo Hamutenya. In his year-end review of 
developments in the Namibian economy since independence and 
prospects for recovery in the immediate future, Mr. Hamutenya 
pointed out that there are "very positive prospects for an 
economic upswing in the next two years and beyond," with new 
investments totalling more than N[Namibian] $700 million to be 
launched this year. Mr. Hamutenya says that the new investments 
of more than N$700 million represents 15 percent of 140 
projects, ideas, proposals, and profiles presented by potential 
investors to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Areas of 
interest in industrial investment ranges from cement, clothing, 
the manufacturing of plastics, vehicle assembly plants, mining 
activities, and fertilizer production. 
  Mr. Hamutenya said in the review that 165 delegations of 
potential and real investors visited Namibia in 1993, compared 
to 26 in 1992. He stated that the increasing international 
interest in the Namibian economy is accompanied, however, by a 
"disturbing tendency towards protectionism by Namibian 
businessmen." As examples of this he cited recent controversies 
surrounding investment plans by Pick &amp; Pay, Olympia Reisen, 
City 
Savings and Investment Bank, and the South African Breweries. 
"It is sad that many potential investors leave the country 
discouraged by the negative attitudes they encounter in the 
local business community. Namibia's true interest is served by 
expansion, not the restriction of economic activities in the 
country, and it is such expansion of production lines and trade 
which holds positive prospects for medium-term economic 
recovery." 
  He points out that insufficient new investment by existing 
local companies since independence has hurt the country's 
economic development. Mr. Hamutenya says that while it is fair 
to say that this lack of investment by local companies does not 
indicate a lack of trust in the new political order, it is also 
true that apart from the fishing industry, there has not been 
any significant local investment since independence. "In other 
words, except for the exchange of assets, concerning the 
depreciation of existing capital stocks, very few of the 
existing companies made any new substantial investments since 
independence." Mr. Hamutenya added that the next three years 
will be a period in which the analyses and policy compiled since 
independence will be implemented in tangible projects. This 
includes land reforms and the rationalization of the civil 
service, two of the most important outstanding issues to be 
addressed by government. 
  "Land reforms are central to the objective of fair economic 
development." One of his main aims is to find "a reasonable and 
fair way in which to transfer land from those who have too much 
of it, to those who do not have it." The government is aware 
that land is the most fundamental form of ownership and that the 
issue could have negative socioeconomic and political 
consequences if it is not addressed. The minister says that for 
this reason the government looked earnestly at viable options to 
resolve existing imbalances concerning access to land. 
  Mr. Hamutenya said that the rationalization of the civil 
service is also essential for the reduction of "what is 
obviously intolerable" -- namely, the level of continuous 
government expenditure. "For the medium-term the government is 
refocusing its budgetary policy to promote the growth of 
productive economic investment". He also indicated that 1994 
will be the year for ensuring that practical economic benefits 
are reaped from investments.

<F P=106> [Report by Gordon Mbuli] </F>
  [Text] The banned Ngwane National Liberatory Congress 
[NNLC] has charged that Tinkhundla [traditional community 
councils] is a collection of chiefs gathered for evil political 
purposes. In its end of year message, the NNLC has warned the 
government to stop threatening political parties in the country. 
The party said government must realise that without political 
parties, the British Government would never have granted 
independence to Swaziland. 
  The statement signed by the NNLC President Dr Ambrose Zwane 
and the secretary general, Mr Africa Mhlanga, said both the 
Prime Minister and his deputy should not pretend to be ignorant 
of this as they are witnesses. "Both Mbilini and Sishayi 
Nxumalo were on the side of political parties when all this took 
place, they must not pretend to have forgotten so quickly. 
There can be no democracy without political parties. The 
international community is pressuring non-democratic countries 
like Swaziland and Malawi to change their government and 
parliaments towards the direction of multi-party democracy." 
  The NNLC says South Africa has accepted the challenge, 
Malawi 
is in the process of changing, Mozambique has accepted 
multiparty democracy, and both Lesotho and Botswana have also 
accepted it. "Why should people think Swaziland should be alone 
-- no man is an island, and therefore, our country Ngwane -- 
Swaziland -- cannot afford to be the only country in Southern 
Africa that has not accepted democracy. The Swaziland 
Government now calls itself a new democracy, they have not yet 
fullfilled the big question mark, who opposes them in 
parliament?" 
  The NNLC said this is a question the masses were asking them 
during the Tinkhundla review issue and are still asking in 1994. 
"This is a ten thousand dollar question for Prince Mbilini and 
his cabinet." The party claimed that the 1993 elections were a 
minority affair not an event involving the entire nation. It 
claimed that statistics have proven that 25 percent of the 
people entitled to vote participated in the elections. The NNLC 
also cited a number of contradictions to what is going on, 
different to the recommendations of the Prince Mahlal'engangeni 
Tinkhundla Review Commission. 
  It said page 45 of the report states clear that the House of 
Assembly should be a wholly elected house, i.e., none of its 
members are to be appointed. NNLC says the aim of the 
recommendation was to retain as far as possible, the democratic 
composition of the house based on the direct election of the 
house by not diluting the house with appointed members. 
  "The NNLC has always recommended that parliament should 
consist of 60 members elected on a basis of single member 
constituencies on a basis of one man, one vote and one woman, 
one vote. We decry the tendency to mix the meaning of the word 
constituency with Inkhundla [traditional community council]. 
Inkhundla in our opinion is a conglomeration of chieftancies 
gathered for evil political purpose." 
  The NNLC said paragraph 48 of Prince Mahlal'engangeni's 
report states that the majority of speakers at the Mbabane 
Inkhundla did not want the Tinkhundla system altogether.

they want the government to be able to freely investigate 
allegations that they were all involved in drug trafficking. 
From Lusaka, Joy Mwinga sent this telex: 
  Announcing their resignation at a press conference this 
morning, the Winas said that the Chiluba cabinet was ripe with 
corruption and challenged seven ministers linked to the misuse 
of donor funds to follow their example and resign. They accused 
some cabinet ministers, in particular, of conspiring with the 
donor community and the independent press to try and bring down 
President Chiluba's two- year-old admnistration. The Winas' 
resgination comes only five days after the resignation of 
Foreign Affairs Minister Vernon Mwaanga, who had been hounded by 
allegations of drug trafficking. He also claimed that the 
Chiluba admnistration was infested with corrupt ministers who 
had enriched themselves at the expense of the taxpayer. 
  President Chiluba has been under intense pressure to stamp 
out widespread corruption and drug trafficking in his government 
since the donor community threatened Zambia with a cut off of 
aid, unless President Chiluba cleaned up his government. Mr. 
Mwaanga and the Winas have been linked to the growing narcotic 
[word indistinct] since the (Chaila) tribunal appointed by 
former President Kenneth Kaunda to investigate drug trafficking 
implicated them in 1985. Both Mr. Mwaanga and the Winas 
dismissed the (Chaila) tribunal report as a piece of political 
propaganda employed by former President Kaunda as a desperate 
effort to discredit the opposition. 
  Sources close to President Chiluba say that he is likely to 
dismiss several ministers over the next few days in response to 
the concerns of the donor community, but for the while, 
President Chiluba is facing ever increasing criticism. 
Opposition parties as well as student groups have said that he 
can no longer control his ministers and that he himself should 
resign. Furthermore, there are signs that his cabinet is 
splitting along tribal lines. The Winas accused several cabinet 
ministers of hounding them out of office. They say that these 
ministers are all from the Mambwe tribe from [word indistinct] 
district who the Winas describe as the [words indistinct].

  [Text] The Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, cabinet 
ministers, and parliamentarians have awarded themselves salary 
increases ranging from 30 to 64 percent, backdated to last July. 
  A report from Harare said this was the first increase in 
salaries of the president and his ministers since 1992, when all 
increments were suspended due to a severe drought that left half 
the country's population of 10 million dependent on imported 
food. Mr. Mugabe got the largest increase of 64 percent, 
pushing his annual salary to 17,560 U.S. dollars, plus housing 
and other allowances of 6,829 dollars a year. An average 
Zimbabwean worker is paid about 900 dollars a year. Mr. Mugabe 
also does not pay income tax. Mr. Mugabe's two vice-presidents 
received 60 percent increases and sharply increased housing and 
general allowances. 
  Ministers received a 30-percent increase in salaries, plus 
allowances which rose by nearly 90 percent, while the salaries 
of Members of Parliament were raised by nearly 50 percent.

  [Text] Johannesburg jan 9 SAPA -- Shots were fired during 
Joe Slovo's and Cyril Ramaphosa's tour of East Rand townships on 
Sunday. South African Communist Party head Joe Slovo and African 
National Congress [ANC] chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa were 
whiskered [as received] away by bodyguards seconds after the 
shooting. 
  ANC bodyguards returned fire immediately but it is not known 
at this stage whether anyone was injured in the armed assault. 
  Initial reports indicated the shots were fired from the 
nearby Mazibuko hostel. 
  Reporters dove for cover, and a SAPA reporter on the scene 
said at least 40 rounds were fired. 
  Police helcopters were on the scene. 
  The tour, ironically was to "give impetus" to the peace 
process at Katlehong and Thokoza.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 9 SAPA -- One journalist died and 
two were injured when shots were fired at a tour group to the 
East Rand led by South African Communist Party head Joe Slovo 
and African National Congress General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa. 
The dead journalist was identified as Abdul Shariff, a freelance 
photographer, by his colleagues on the scene of the shooting. 
He died of a bullet wound in the chest. His next-of-kin have 
not yet been informed. 
  Two SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
journalists 
were also injured in the shooting. TV news journalist Charles 
Moikanyang was shot in the hip and SABC radio news journalist 
Anthea Warner sustained a flesh wound. 
  Reporters at Natalspruit Hospital on the East Rand said 
another two civilians were injured in the shooting. 
  Witwatersrand police spokesman Brig Zirk Gouws said police 
had shot dead one man armed with an AK-47 and another armed man 
was wounded. One AK-47 assault rifle was recovered by the police. 
  Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Slovo were being briefed as they led the 
tour party, through the derelict Dikolale section of Katlehong 
when the shooting started at 3.45pm. A volley of shots appeared 
to come from the nearby Mazibuko and Kwesini hostels. 
  Bodyguards pushed the two leaders to the ground and then 
whisked them away. Some armed ANC members in the party returned 
fire. 
  Several journalists remained near the scene of the shooting, 
holed-up behind an abandoned house about 250m in front of the 
hostels. Local residents also taking cover behind the house 
blamed police and Inkatha hostel residents for the attack. As 
the gunfire appeared to come closer, the group of journalists 
were advised by residents to take cover about six houses further 
back. 
  The singing from a Zionist Christian Church service nearby 
could be heard above the sporadic bursts of automatic and 
handgun fire. But, after the service ended and the worshippers 
poured out from under their corrugated iron shelter, they also 
were fired upon. 
  The situation remained tense and sporadic shooting continued 
well over an hour after the initial shots were fired. 
  Residents believed a police helicopter flying overhead was 
responsible for the continuing gunfire and they continously 
dived for cover. 
  Several men were armed with AK-47 rifles. SABC radio news 
reports that five people were arrested and police also 
confiscated four AK-47 rifles after the attack. Brig Zirk Gouws 
said the men had been arrested after they had been observed 
carrying AK-47s by policeman in an overflying helicopter. 
  He said the police had not been approached by the SACP 
[South African Communist Party] or the ANC [African National 
Congress] to provide protection for the convoy before the 
shooting. 
  Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel was quick to react 
expressing his shock at the incident. "It is is absolutely 
unforgivable that attacks should be made on the press, whose 
function is absolutely essential for the democratic process." He 
said this showed just how deeply the culture of intolerance and 
violence was rooted in certain East Rand townships.

  [Text] A journalist was killed and two wounded when 
ANC/SACP [African National Congress/South African Communist 
Party] tour of Katlehong on the East Rand ended in tragedy 
today. Several residents were also injured when gunfire erupted 
from a nearby hostel. Jessica Pitchford reports that the visit 
was one of steps in a peace plan announced by the ANC PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region on Thursday. 
Following visuals by (Mzima Dudi) and REUTERS: 
  [Begin recording] [Pitchford] We began our day in Katlehong 
with a visit to the hostels. Residents here denied recent 
allegations of abduction and killing. They showed us bullet 
scarred walls and said they were the victims. Very soon we 
were. In nearby Dikolale section TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council] members, Cyril Ramaphosa and Joe Slovo, with the ANC's 
Robert McBride and Carl Niehaus, surveyed war-ravaged homes. 

    Suddenly all hell broke loose. The shooting came from the 
nearby hostel. Self-defense units grabbed their guns. 
Journalists ducked for cover, but for some it was too late. 
Freelance photographer, Abdul Shariff, was killed. SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] reporter, Charles Moikanyang, 
was shot in the hip. 
  [Moikanyang] It was a mad situation. I see one man coming 
and falling down, and when I try to look back at him, and then I 
felt the pain at the back, and then I fell down. I couldn't 
move. And people were now moving out of the area, and I was 
like worried that everybody is going to go out and leave me 
behind. Then I screamed to you, and you also screamed, and then 
fortunately you called people to come and help. 
  [Pitchford] Another SABC journalists, Anthea Warner, was 
slightly injured. The situation in Katlehong can perhaps best 
be described in the words of injured reporter, Charles 
Moikanyang. 
  [Moikanyang] Well it has been my feeling recently that 
Katlehong, Thokoza have become hopeless, and we didn't, you 
know, enjoy the thought of coming to do coverage of a story in 
this area, but it's all in the game. [end recording] 
  [Adrian Steed] Reporter Karen Kriel is at police 
headquarters 
in Johannesburg where a news conference is just being held on 
these shootings in Katlehong. Karen what do the police say? 
  [Kriel] Police say that three people have killed one person. 
[sentence as heard] They displayed four AK-47s they 
confiscated. The police are still uncertain whether the weapons 
confiscated belonged to hostel dwellers or residents that used 
them in self- defense. The police came under fire from 
journalists who were at the scene, who said they didn't see one 
single policeman, only a helicopter. In reply the police said 
they maintained a presence in the area, but were never requested 
by the ANC to accompany the tour. 
  [Steed] And Karen, after the attack Cyril Ramaphosa said, 
and 
I quote, the police must have known we were coming, we're just 
surprised and shocked that there was no attempt to have police 
presence and protection in the area. What did the police have 
to say about that? 
  [Kriel] Adrian, Brigadier Zirk Gouws said if a certain 
political party doesn't want the police to interfere, they 
don't. And in reaction to a question whether the police would 
not act in a potentially dangerous situation such as this one if 
they were not asked to do so, the police replied it depended on 
the situation. 
  [Steed] Thank you Karen.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela by SABC </F>
presenter John Bishop, in the Johannesburg studio, on the Agenda 
Program -- live] 
  [Text] [Bishop] Welcome back. Our promised interview with 
Mr. Nelson Mandela, the ANC [African National Congress] 
president, whose organization, I'm sure you know, has just 
celebrated its 82d birthday, and issued a major policy 
statement. As you probably also know all parties in the country 
are gearing up for their promised elections, and the papers are 
full of the contenders criticizing and attacking one another in 
print. But there has been a serious attack earlier today at 
Katlehong. When I welcome you Mr. Mandela I want to put that 
question to you? 
  [Mandela] Thank you. 
  [Bishop] Your comments on that -- that Katlehong incident. 
  [Mandela] What happened today, to the secretary general of 
the ANC, and the chairman of the South African Communist Party 
[SACP], must be condemned in the strongest terms. It shows in a 
very clear manner how the people in that area live. I spoke to 
Mr. de Klerk today the moment Comrade Ramaphosa reported the 
incident to me, and he had promised to go into the matter and 
come back to me. I am meeting him on Tuesday morning, and I 
have got a specific proposal to make to him. If he does not act 
on that proposal, then South Africa is facing a crisis. 
  [Bishop] Can you give us any details of that? 
  [Mandela] It is better for me not to do so, and it will give 
him the opportunity of examining the proposal, and deciding what 
he should do about it, that he'll understand that we cannot 
allow a situation where a hostel has now become the center of 
the most blatant criminal action, and without the police doing 
anything. What is going to be of interest, is what action the 
police are going to take. Are they going to raid the hostel? 
When are they going to do so? Will they in the course of that 
raid seize the illegal weapons in that hostel? Arrest the 
culprits? That is going to be very interesting. 
  [Bishop] Just to remind our viewers, if you've just tuned 
in, 
there's been a really awful attack at Katlehong earlier today. 
One journalist was killed, several were wounded, and it was the 
occasion when Mr. Slovo and Cyril Ramaphosa, and Carl Niehaus 
and others, were walking towards the area, to inspect the area. 
Is that it? 
  [Mandela] Yes, they went there to see for themselves how 
people in this area are living in the light of the accusations 
and counter- accusations that have been made. And I think that 
the public now has got an idea of what is happing there, because 
the shooting started from the hostel without any provocation. 
  [Bishop] What about the argument, I think that there is an 
argument, that the ANC had constantly said they don't want the 
police around them when they go and visit the people. Is there 
anything in that argument? 
  [Mandela] There is no excuse for the police not doing their 
duty of maintaining law and order. 
  [Bishop] They were told about the... 
  [Mandela, interrupting]...Whether we want the police to be 
with us or not is irrelevant. The police should not allow any 
people to fire at innocent residents going about with their 
normal duties. 
  [Bishop] I think they were in fact informed. Were they? 
Some of your people told me earlier... 
  [Text] [Mandela] On Friday the Regional Executive Committee 
of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area informed 
the police. Even quite apart from that it was well publicized 
that the secretary general and the chairman of the South African 
Communist Party were visiting the area. If the police did not 
know that they were visiting then they are not worth to be 
policemen. 
  [Bishop] Well, of course, we have no police here, so we 
better not keep it one-sided I think. Could I just leave it for 
you at the moment? You are going to see everybody of course, 
soon, about this, and leave this incident and move on to the 
general question of violence in the country? 
  [Mandela] You're welcome. 
  [Bishop] Thank you. What are we going to do, Mr. Mandela? 
First of all, can I suggest that all parties perhaps should stop 
accusing each other? Is it possible to come to that kind of 
agreement? 
  [Mandela] Before I answer your question, I want to state 
very 
clearly that whatever I'm going to say, my approach to problems, 
my conduct and my statements are influenced by the objective of 
building a new South Africa, of urging all leaders of various 
political formations to join in trying to build a new South 
Africa. I'm interested in stability both politically an 
economically so that we can attract investment in our country, 
because without those investments we are unable to make the 
breakthrough which all of us desire. I am, therefore, going to 
say that you can't avoid discussing the policies of other 
political parties which are involved in the election. It 
happens all over the world and South Africa is no exception. 
But the point is that whatever we say must be influenced by the 
idea of building a new South Africa and uniting our people. 
  [Bishop] Have you got anything to give us tonight about 
stopping the violence? I mean, if you had the opportunity to 
put it in a nutshell and fix it, what would you do? 
  [Mandela] Well, we are not the government, you must 
understand. The task of maintaining law and order is that of the 
government, not of the ANC. We have no state power, we have no 
arms, we have no caspirs, and violence can only be effectively 
addressed by people who have these means. But within our 
capacity we have tried, to the best of our ability, as an 
organization to support the efforts which are made by a wide 
variety of organizations for peace. We will continue to do so, 
and that is why we are talking to all political parties -- those 
inside the negotiation process and those who stand outside 
because we want to avoid any danger of a civil war in this 
country. 
  [Bishop] Well, that's taken as is, but it's also said by 
some 
of your critics that some of the SDUs [self-defense units], some 
of those young men have run out of control. You see in the 
headlines: Mafia groups, maverick young men, SDUs out of the 
control of the ANC. Comment? 
  [Mandela] The problem about the SDUs only occurred within 
the 
last six months. People have been dying long before that. You 
must remember that we are dealing with a government which has a 
culture of intolerance. Freedom fighters have been dying since 
the early 60s. There are no less than about 200 people who have 
died in police custody from the 60s and a statement which was 
made by the late Dr. Gluckman, who had the opportunity to deal 
with these cases, a number of other freedom fighters like Neil 
Argot and Richard Turner, the Goniwes, all these were killed 
long before we had any complaint about the SDU. The complaint 
against the SDU is made primarily by the government and the 
National Party in order to divert attention from their own 
criminal negligence. 
  [Bishop] But not entirely. Haven't you come and said, at 
least the ANC came out and said and admitted that some of those 
SDUs are out of control? 
  [Mandela] No, you must put the matter in proper context. We 
have had the courage and honesty to say to the public that we 
have problems with SDUs, but you must understand that the SDUs 
are a community-based organization to protect the masses of the 
people after the government has failed to do its duty, and after 
the people have lost their belongings. They have come out in 
order to provide some measure of protection to the community. 
  [Bishop] I think that's generally known, but it's been 
suggested that now you should instruct -- if that's the word -- 
some of your very senior men, perhaps in Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] who have high 
profiles to go in there and sort it out. 
  [Mandela] We have been there sorting things out. Last 
Tuesday we had that 10-hour meeting with the SDUs in that area, 
involving not only the ANC but the South African Communist 
Party, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], the mass 
democratic movement, and I ask you, what has the government done 
to address the question of violence? 
  [Bishop] Before we move away from this violence, the 
Heidelberg massacres, the continuing attacks on civilians, the 
ever rising crime rate. Again I ask: What can we do? 
  [Text] [Mandela] We are against any form of terrorism, and 
what has happened recently in connection with the tavern attacks 
is a matter that is going to be discussed by the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC]. We are against any form of thuggery, 
and we have condemned it publicly in the strongest terms. 
  [Bishop] The TEC now has some muscle, if I can use that 
[pauses] I mean it is an established organization, and you've 
been addressing the question of violence, I think. We are 
talking about a national peacekeeping force, we are talking 
about an integrated SAP-SADF [South African Police-South African 
Defense Force], Umkhonto we Sizwe, and other groups. How far 
off are we from that, because it strikes me... 
  [Mandela, interrupting] Before I deal with that, let me just 
tell you about the report which was made by the commissioner of 
police from Natal, a report which has been tabled before the 
TEC. In that report he mentions that before the festive season 
he drew the attention of the government to the instability in 
Natal and felt that because the migrants were going back to 
Natal, this might create problems and aggravate the whole 
question of violence. He also got a legal opinion from senior 
council which showed that the South African Police can go into 
Natal and into the homelands without any restrictions. They are 
free to do so. 
  [Bishop] Legally? 
  [Mandela] Legally. And he also went further and identified 
areas where the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the kwaZulu 
police were responsible for this violence, and he mentioned that 
there was a self-defense unit in one area which was alleged also 
to be involved in violence, but he was honest and he said that 
there was no concrete evidence to support this allegation. Now 
that is a statement from a commissioner of police in Natal. And 
you must, therefore, look at the whole question of the SDUs from 
the point of view that we are facing an extraordinary situation 
where the government is working with criminals in order to 
destabilize the people in that region. 
  [Bishop] Let's leave that now but stay in that region and 
ask 
you, when are you and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi going 
to fix things up? 
  [Mandela] Well, I have met Chief Buthelezi on three 
different 
occasions. I have done everything in my power to persuade him 
to come back and negotiate with us. But it is a false premise 
to think that this violence can be addressed by two people 
meeting. In no government in a country anywhere in the world 
will a government refrain from taking steps to maintain law and 
order and rely on two individuals. You don't find that 
anywhere. It is the task of the government to ensure that 
violence is stopped and that the slaughter of innocent people is 
immediately addressed by the government and settled. 
  [Bishop] Do you still say that you will go ahead with the 
elections regardless of whether the Freedom Alliance is on board? 
  [Mandela] We will persuade the Freedom Alliance to join in 
negotiations and to take part in the election. 
  [Bishop] Can you do that? 
  [Mandela] I am discussing with the ultra right. I have met 
General Viljoen, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, Mr. Dries Bruwer, and I 
am discussing the whole question of the violence, their demand 
for a separate volkstaat [national state] and their 
participation in the election. I do so because it is absolutely 
necessary for all sections of our population, for all national 
groups to speak with one voice on the major national issues 
facing the country. 
  [Bishop] Just seven minutes left, I have so much to ask you 
Mr. Mandela. Let's talk about the possibility that your party 
will probably, might -- whatever the expression is -- win the 
election. Let's make the presumption that you do. What kind of 
a South Africa, as far as the economy, will we have? You have 
done away with the idea of nationalization, but we hear a lot of 
talk about redistribution of wealth, a wealth tax and so forth. 
So what can be expected in that area? 
  [Mandela] We are not concerned with labels. Our primary 
object is to address the social, economic problems facing our 
people, the question of unemployment which is 50 percent of the 
economically active population of the country, lack of housing, 
lack of education and medical facilities, and that is our 
object. That must be done by ensuring that the resources of the 
country are equally available to all South Africans irrespective 
of color or creed, and that is what we intend doing. 
  [Bishop] But that requires money, doesn't it? And some 
economists are saying it requires free market style generated 
money, no more talk of a Marxist-Lenin command economy. Comment? 
  [Mandela] We have never talked about a Marxist economy as 
the 
African National Congress. The people who say that we were once 
committed to a Marxist economy are either saying so because of 
ignorance or out of malice. Our concern is not to adopt any 
pattern from any other country. It is to address the real 
problems facing our country, and these are the problems I have 
referred to. We are already as a political organization far 
advanced in seeing organizations like the International Monetary 
Fund with whose president I met in September this year [as 
heard]. We have met the World Bank on several occasions to 
discuss the question of resources to be able to address this 
problem. I have met presidents like Mr. Bill Clinton, Prime 
Minister Major, President Mitterand and all of them I'm 
discussing questions, among others, of resources so that we can 
address the problems I have referred to. 
  [Bishop] What are the assurances you are giving these top 
people about the economy? Are you saying don't worry, 
investment in, profit out, no problem? 
  [Mandela] We are briefing them on the steps that we have 
taken to attract investments. I have pointed out to them that 
in May 1992 we issued an investment guide in which we guaranteed 
all investors against the confiscation of their properties. 
Secondly, that they will be entitled to repatriate their profit 
and dividends and that if an investor sold his business 
activities in the country, he will be entitled to repatriate 
them. 
  [Bishop] Sorry, I've got to rush everything up, so much to 
ask. Quickly, the question of freedom of expression and in 
particular the control of the SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation]. It's been said in certain quarters that the ANC 
now controls the SABC, that the National Party controlled it 
before, now it's the ANC. Does it control the SABC? 
  [Mandela] I don't think so. This is a board that was set up 
by an independent selection panel composed of South Africans of 
the highest integrity. They are not members of the ANC, and 
they could not set up a board which is composed of members of 
the ANC. 
  [Bishop] But they are pointing to three prominent and highly 
professional people who are closely connected to the ANC and 
who've just joined the SABC. Comment? 
  [Mandela] Well, I think that as far as I'm aware, if you are 
talking about the three persons that I know, they have been 
selected because of their merit; not because of association with 
any political organization. 
  [Bishop] To cut it short, you wouldn't [changes thought] 
Let's say you were the leader of the country in three or four 
months, you wouldn't lift the phone and tell news editors and 
other people what to do? 
  [Mandela] The democratic culture is very much entrenched in 
the African National Congress. We believe in an independent 
media because we would like to look at the media as a mirror to 
see how we are functioning, and to control the media would be 
contrary to the fundamental principles of democracy, and it is 
for that that we have attacked the National Party's control of 
the SABC. 
  [Bishop] Moving to another matter very quickly in the time 
left. The Afrikaners, what is wrong if a group of Afrikaners 
sincerely want to move away and live on their own? 
  [Mandela] We are against ethnic solutions. 
  [Bishop] Why? 
  [Mandela] We have fought the bantustans system, and we have 
now overthrown that system. Even the Nationalist government 
which was the only government which recognized the bantustans 
has now agreed, and a clause has been entrenched in our 
constitution that all the bantustans, all the homelands -- 
self-governing and independent -- must now be reincorporated 
into South Africa. If we made an exception and gave in to the 
demand of the Afrikaners for a volkstaat [national state], we 
would be reopening the same thing. All the bantustans would put 
forward similar claims and you will break up South Africa into a 
number of different political entities which would destroy our 
economy. 
  [Bishop] Just a few seconds left. What kind of message would 
you send now at this point in our history? 
  [Mandela] We would like the spirit of reconciliation to be 
accepted by all South Africans. 
  [Bishop] Not revenge? 
  [Mandela] No. We have made the point very clearly that we 
are not here for retribution. We are here to try and contribute 
to the building of a new South Africa. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Mandela, thank you very much indeed for coming 
along. Need I say that was Nelson Mandela of the Africa 
National Congress? Thanks for joining us and staying with us. 
Good night. 
  [Mandela] Good night.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 9 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela interviewed by SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] TV's Agenda said he had spoken 
to President F W de Klerk about Sunday's Katlehong shooting. He 
said he had made a specific proposal on dealing with violence 
ahead of their Tuesday talks. 
  "If he does not act on that proposal, then South Africa is 
facing a crisis," he said. He declined to give details. 
  But he added: "We cannot allow a situation where a hostel 
has 
become the centre of the most blatant criminal action and 
without the police doing anything."

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 9 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] leader Nelson Mandela reiterated on Sunday his 
organisation would not grant the Afrikaners demand for a 
separate homeland [volkstaat]. He said in a SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] television interview such a move 
would lead to other ethnic groups demanding their own separate 
entities and the break up the country. 
  "(We) will be breaking up South Africa into a number of 
different political entities which will destroy the economy," he 
said. "We are against an ethnic solution," he said, adding 
granting Afrikaners their demand for a volkstaat would inspire 
other groups whose homelands have been reincorporated into South 
Africa presenting similar claims. 
  But he said he was continuing talks with Conservative Party 
and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leaders 
discussing their demands for self-determination. He also said 
his organisation would press ahead with efforts to persuade the 
Freedom Alliance to take part in the forthcoming elections. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party has announced it will not take 
part. 
  Asked to state his message to South Africans, Mr Mandela 
called for reconciliation. "We would like a spirit of 
reconciliation to be accepted by all South Africans. We are not 
here for retribution, we are here to try to contribute to the 
building of of a new South Africa," said Mr Mandela.

Freedom Party's [IFP] Central Committee has decided the party 
will definitely not take part in the 27 April election. It will 
also not participate in any structure of the transitional

  The Central Committee reiterated during its meeting at

that it will not participate in the Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC], nor will it recognize any decisions by the TEC. 
According to the IFP, it will only reconsider its stance when 
its constitutional proposals, as contained in the Freedom

  [Text] The National Party [NP] and the ANC [African 
National Congress] have indicated in separate statements that 
there are limits to the extent that they are prepared to go in 
their negotiations with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the 
Freedom Alliance. The statements were issued in reaction to the 
decision by the IFP Central Committee that the party will not 
take part in the April election unless the constitutional 
demands by the Alliance are met. 
  The NP said it was prepared to consider the proposals by the 
IFP and the Alliance on merit, but that it would not be 
intimidated in the process. The party said it appeared that the 
IFP and the Alliance were turning towards blackmail, and there 
was a strong likelihood of the two organizations painting 
themselves into a corner. 
  The ANC said its executive committee would discuss the 
matter 
next Friday if the IFP informed the ANC of its decision 
formally. The ANC said although it remained committed to 
negotiations with all parties, there was no chance of the 
election being postponed. The organization said the reasonable 
demands in the joint document signed by the ANC, the government, 
and the IFP could end the present deadlock. 
  The IFP Central Committee said in a statement that if its 
demands were not met, it would not take part in the elections, 
liaise with the new parliamentary or provincial councils, 
participate in the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], nor 
accept TEC decisions. The IFP considered the reintroduction of 
double ballot papers as nonnegotiable.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] Natal Midlands 
region has joined the chorus of criticism against Inkatha's 
decision not to take part in the election. Midlands spokesman 
Blade Nzimande says the decision is the most direct warning that 
the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] way forward in the transition 
process is going to be waging war in Natal. 
  Nzimande says the IFP decision, made at its Central 
Committee 
meeting yesterday, is the most serious threat to the transition 
process. The Midlands spokesperson says what is even more 
serious is the fact that the IFP is placing the fate of the 
oppressed majority in the hands of the right wing. 
  Nzimande also says all those in Inkatha who are for national 
liberation and democracy should abandon the IFP and join forces 
with democracy.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 8 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party's [IFP] decision to boycott the April 27 election was a 
signal that they are prepared for more violence, African 
National Congress [ANC] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] chairman Tokyo Sexwale said on Saturday. Mr Sexwale 
was addressing thousands of supporters at the ANC's 82nd 
anniversary celebrations at Orlando Stadium in Soweto. 
  He said the ANC was, even at this late stage, prepared to 
call on members of the IFP to dissociate themselves from their 
leadership and join the ANC. "Away with violence, we say come 
back (Chief Mangosuthu) Buthelezi. Don't take us to Angola, 
Somalia and Ireland. You were once a member of the ANC Youth 
League, so you will be more than welcome to come back. "We say 
to Buthelezi that our people's blood will remain in his hands. 
Stop the violence because we don't want to bury people anymore," 
Mr Sexwale said. 
  He went on to describe the freedom alliance as a "fascist 
alliance". 
  Mr Sexwale said the ANC was against poverty, unemployment 
and 
was going to bury these by winning the April election. 
  "Away with the (President F W) de Klerk government. When 
April 27 comes, we should all be ready to vote. That election 
will be an election for victory, democracy and 
self-determination. It is an election that will make Africans 
take over the country," he said. 
  Mr Sexwale said people should go out of their way to teach 
uneducated people about voting. 
  Meanwhile AP reports that Irish Foreign Minister Dick 
Spring, 
on the first official visit by an Irish minister to South 
Africa, stood next to ANC Deputy President Walter Sisulu during 
the singing of the African anthem, ''God Bless Africa.'' He 
arrived in South Africa earlier on Saturday.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 8 SAPA -- Election posters of the 
National Party [NP] and Democratic Party [DP] will be removed 
from all black townships, the Azanian People's Organisation 
[AZAPO] said on Saturday. About 500 AZAPO central Wits 
[Witwatersrand] region members also decided at a meeting in 
Dobsonville, Soweto, that "hostile media" would be targeted and 
that an anti-election drive would soon be started. 
  The meeting vowed to remove any NP or DP poster found in 
black townships, saying that it was "undemocratic and 
opportunistic for oppressors to organise among the oppressed 
people of Azania". The DP and NP should put up their posters in 
white areas, the meeting resolved. It was further decided that 
the newly formed campaign committee would conduct 
"house-to-house voter education" in Alexandra and Bekkersdal. 
  From next week the committee will also be visiting Lenasia, 
Eldorado Park, greater Soweto, Mohlakeng, Kagiso to introduce 
AZAPO's anti-election campaign. The region further resolved to 
take "immediate action against hostile media... by all means 
necessary". No specific newspaper or news organisation was 
mentioned. 
  The meeting also called for the immediate release of all 
detained Azanian Liberation Army cadres.

  [Text] The ANC plans to send its candidates for the nine 
provincial premierships to Canada and the United States to study 
how their counterparts conduct government, ANC [African National 
Congress] constitutional and legal director Zola Skweyiya said 
yesterday. The ANC candidates -- who are assured of provincial 
premierships if the ANC wins the April 27 election -- are 
expected to learn from the experiences of Canadian provincial 
premiers and US state governors. 
  Skweyiya was outlining the ANC's attempts to train a corps 
of 
civil servants to assume key posts in a post-election 
administration. He said about 100 civil servants had already 
been trained in the UK, US and Canada, and that the ANC was 
engaged in several public administration-related training 
programmes. Potential civil servants were also being hosted in 
southern African states. 
  The ANC had also begun training a parliamentary unit that 
would advise Cabinet Ministers and the president. The unit's 
members would study the functioning of federal parliaments in 
the US, Canada and Germany. Methods of constitutional 
arbitration in federal states were also being studied. 
  Skweyiya said the ANC was collating curricula vitae of 
people 
it intended sending for specialised training and had thrown its 
net as wide as possible to include people who did not 
necessarily support the ANC.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 8 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] western Cape regional chairman Dr Allan Boesak may 
still be elected premier of the region despite his poor showing 
on the region's list of candidates for the provincial 
legislature. Regional secretary Lerumo Kalako said on Saturday 
Dr Boesak was one of the front-runners for the regional 
premiership by virtue of his position as regional chairman of 
the ANC, a post to which he was recently unanimously re-elected. 
  He dismissed as "mischievous" reports that Dr Boesak had 
suffered a setback in his bid to head the western Cape regional 
government and said the order of appearance on the list did not 
influence a candidate's chances for the premiership. Mr Kalako 
said the ANC's western Cape region had invited nominations for 
the premiership from all its structures and affiliates and would 
elect a candidate before the movement's national election list 
conference on January 15. 
  The region's lists of nominees to the National Assembly and 
the provincial legislature were released at a press conference 
at the University of the Western Cape [UWC] on Saturday. 
  Dr Boesak's name is 12th on the provincial list and fourth 
on 
the list of candidates for the National Assembly. 
  The regional list is headed by Executive Committee member Ms 
Zou Kota, followed by REC [regional executive committee] 
colleagues Cameron Dugmore, Vincent Diba, Lerumo Kalako, Johnny 
Issel, Hilda Ndude, Chris Nissen, Ebrahim Rasool and National 
Executive Committee member Reggie September. 
  Others nominated for the regional parliament are Dr Boesak's 
former wife, Dorothy; former ANC western Cape secretary Tony 
Yengeni; NEC members Dullah Omar, Trevor Manuel and Albie Sachs; 
ANC-aligned MPs Jan van Eck and Jannie Momberg; Mrs Adelaide 
Tambo, widow of late ANC Chairman Oliver Tambo; Peninsula 
Technikon Rector Franklin Sonn and academics Rob Davies and 
Colin Bundy. 
  Topping the list of nominees for the national assembly is 
civil rights lawyer and ANC regional spokesman on constitutional 
affairs Johnny de Lange. His name is followed by that of South 
African Municipal Workers' Union leader Salie Manie; ANC 
constitutional negotiator Dullah Omar; Dr Boesak; Mr Yengeni; 
trade unionist Daniel Oliphant; regional office-bearers Vincent 
Diba, Lerumo Kalako and Zou Kota and UWC Professor Rob Davies. 
  Other names on the national list are NEC [National Executive 
Committee] members Kader Asmal, Thozamile Botha and Trevor 
Manuel; SA Democratic Teachers' Union general secretary Randall 
van den Heever; ANC MP David Dalling; Mrs Dorothy Boesak and 
Labour Party MPs Ken Lategan and James Swiegelaar. 
  ANC regional head of information and publicity Bulelani 
Ngcuka said the ANC had "made every attempt" to inform those 
nominated. "We have tried our best to contact everyone, but it 
could be that there are one or two names on the list who have 
not yet been consulted. There is, however, still an opportunity 
for people to withdraw their names if they do not wish to be 
nominees." 
  Mr Kalako said both lists were still subject to adjustment, 
particularly with regard to the "affirmative action principle" 
that women should make up one-third of the candidates. The 
region would also try to ensure that all communities and social 
sectors, such rural people, were fairly represented in its lists 
of nominees.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 8 SAPA -- White mineworkers set up 
military-type fortifications around Radio Pretoria on Saturday 
to repel possible moves by government forces to close down the 
transmitter. Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, 
AVF] spokesman Stephen Maninger said about 300 members of the 
rightwing mineworkers union assisted in digging trenches and 
vehicle traps and piling up bullet-proof sandbags around the 
station at Donkerhoek, east of Pretoria. 
  Cmdt Piet le Roux, of the Pretoria Boer Commando Group, who 
is in charge of security at the site, said on Saturday if all 
peaceful measures had been exhausted, "when it comes to the 
push, we will fight". 
  Cmdt Willem Ratte, sought by the police for his part in the 
Schanskop Fort Siege, on Saturday reportedly assisted in 
training Boer Commando members to repel any attack by police or 
defence force members on the station. The training session took 
place near the Radio Pretoria caravan site, but reporters were 
barred from the area. 
  The chairman of the broadcaster's management committee, 
Dominee Mossie van den Berg, also arrived to express his 
appreciation to the miners. He said he would meet Home Affairs 
Minister Danie Schutte on Monday to discuss the further 
extension of the station's temporary broadcasting licence, 
although the authority to issue such licences will soon be 
vested in the independent broadcasting authority. 
  Meanwhile, station personnel said repeater stations 
extending 
the station's FM signal to other parts of the Transvaal were 
being planned. At Brits, the first repeater transmitter was due 
to come on line on Saturday. Local communities would assume 
responsibility for the repeater towers and transmitters, 
carrying Radio Pretoria's service to more listeners around the 
province. 
  Cmdt Le Roux said any efforts to shut down the station would 
initially be opposed on legal grounds. Thereafter, tens of 
thousands of unarmed civilians would be called on to form a 
human wall around the station and protect it by means of passive 
resistance. "Because of the freedom of speech principle, we 
hope there will be an international outcry if they try to snuff 
us out. But passive resistance has its limitations, and if the 
government tries to take advantage of this, we will fight." 
  An unidentified symphasizer bought four armoured watchtower 
units from Escom, and donated them to the station. They will be 
erected on the corners of the station's razor-wire-protected 
premises. 
  Cmdt Le Roux conceded the station could not repel any 
conventional military onslaught in the long run. There would be 
a battle between thousands of soldiers and "bloodshed on a big 
scale", he said. But if the rightwing lost this battle, a new 
phase of guerrilla warfare and sabotage may dawn on the country, 
observers say. 
  Cmdt Le Roux estimated the assets at the station at about 
R[rand]2-million. 
  On Saturday morning, broadcaster Jahannes van der Walt, a 
former SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] newsreader, 
was on duty in the mobile studio, parked on a hot, dusty koppie 
at Donkerhoek. An endless stream of visitors arrived at the 
studio, some bringing refreshments and old Afrikaans records to 
add to the station's collection. Some camped at the caravan 
site for R10 a day, but they asked a guard not allow television 
crews into the area for the sake of their peace and privacy.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SATURDAY STAR </H6>
  Time for TEC To Act -- "The Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] must act now to ensure that Transkei co-operates fully 
with the police in investigating last week's massacre at the 
Heidelberg Tavern in Cape Town -- or risk severe damage to its 
credibility," an editorial in the Johannesburg SATURDAY STAR in 
English on 8 January on page 8 notes. The TEC, which is 
"supposed to embody the progress reached at the talks, remains 
silent, leaving this critical issue suspended in the hot air 
generated by the SAP's [South African Police] increasingly 
heated allegations against Transkei and [Transkei military 
leader] Holomisa's absurd demands for an independent inquiry 
conducted solely by foreigners." The TEC is "not being asked to 
condone another raid on Transkei," but "to deliver the 
accountable, flexible and responsive government that the 
negotiators kept promising" as South Africans "worry about 
killers being caught, not what political points are scored by 
whom." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Secret Vote a Cornerstone of Democracy -- The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans of 4 January points out in a page 8 
editorial: "One issue which continues to feature in the 
country's political debate is that of a secret ballot. It is a 
cornerstone of democracy, because only if voters know that they 
can make a free choice at the polling booth can there be any 
talk of a truly fair election. Unfortunately our tradition of 
violence and intimidation serves as a weapon in the political 
arsenal." "Add to this a huge new voter corps which is still 
politically unsophisticated, and it becomes clear that the ideal 
of a free election is threatened by threats, superstition, and 
distorted information." "Just how important this matter is has 
again been underlined by claims that members of the African 
National Congress' military wing are joining the National Party 
[NP] and the Democratic Party." BEELD continues: "The very fact 
that the NP is not prepared to say who, and how many, of them 
have joined its ranks is another indication that our political 
climate is not healthy. The more open the process, the easier 
it would be to separate fact from propaganda. No matter how 
strong the urge for power, political parties owe it to South 
Africa to create a culture of moral competition. It is as 
strong a guarantee as a new constitution." 
  Police Deaths `Unaffordable' -- "Last year alone 260 South 
African policemen died violently --people who, in the combating 
of crime, have become the victims of that crime," notes a second 
editorial on page 8 of the same issue of BEELD. For a force 
working under extremely difficult conditions, this "slaughter is 
unaffordably high. It is a fact that the police have an 
unenviable and dangerous task, because it does not always 
involve only the combating of crime. More and more they find 
themselves in the crossfire of power-hungry political groups to 
whom human lives, including those of policemen, have become very 
cheap." "It is difficult to understand why the communities 
refuse to help the police. Their refusal leads to a chain 
reaction which eventually boomerangs, because it feeds anarchy 
and promotes the climate of violence. In the end it is not only 
the police, but the community and the country as a whole who 
suffer under the chaos created by these criminals." 
  Siting of Parliament Already a Serious Debate -- The 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 5 January says in a page 10 
editorial: "One of the most sensitive political debates in South 
Africa is that of the siting of Parliament in a new 
dispensation. At the moment it is still a whispered debate, but 
it is already being seriously talked about. Chances are that 
none of the major parties would like to bring this issue out 
into the open. An election campaign is on the go, and with the 
important emphasis which regional parlaiments will be given, 
parties would certainly not wish to disturb or harm regional 
interests." It is a fact, adds BEELD, "that the advantages and 
disadvantages of two capitals -- Cape Town the legislative and 
Pretoria the administrative -- are already being studied in 
political, economic, and diplomatic circles. The ANC [African 
National Congress] has confirmed that some of its officials are 
in favor of moving Parliament, and within the ruling party the 
matter has sometimes also been discussed unofficially. We do 
not wish to set in motion an emotional debate because we believe 
that the election campaign must deal with fundamental issues," 
but "we do await the eventual debate on this vital issue." 
  Right Channels Not Followed with Transkei -- A second 
editorial in the 5 Janaury edition argues that: "In the light of 
what has taken place in the past, one would expect the police to 
be vary careful when they accuse Transkei's Major General Bantu 
Holomisa." "For quite some time now efforts have been made to 
prove that the general allows his country to be used as a 
springboard for terrorist attacks on South Africa." Until now 
all these efforts have boomeranged. The worst instance was the 
defense force raid on a so- called base of the Pan-Africanist 
Congress' military wing in Umtata. Now it is being alleged that 
the police know exactly where the suspects of the Cape Town 
tavern attack are, but that they can do nothing because these 
people are hiding in Transkei. On the surface it would seem 
that this sensitive matter is being mishandled. It looks as 
though the correct channels were not followed to remove the 
stumbling blocks. Gen. Holomisa has offered his full 
cooperation in the investigation. Accept the offer, let justice 
take its course, and bring the guilty to book." 
  Parties Have Duty to Make TEC Succeed -- A third editorial 
on 
5 January on page 10 of BEELD warns: "The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] has not even had its first full session of 1994 
and already there is talk of a test of strength between the TEC 
and the government over political and security issues in 
kwaZulu." "No one wants to avoid robust politics. Nevertheless 
the role players in the TEC, and in particular their political 
masters, must realize that they have a duty to make the TEC 
succeed. The political confidence index among the South African 
public is not particularly high at present. If the TEC, in whom 
considerable hope has been placed, becomes involved in a 
tug-of-war at this early stage, the already difficult transition 
will be made that much more difficult." Leaders should ensure, 
says BEELD, "that the TEC is not discredited in the eyes of the 
public as just another political wrestling ring. They must 
show...an understanding for the realities of this country."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY STAR </H6>
  IFP Election Decision -- The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
"has 
about 12 weeks in which to prepare for the most important 
election in the country's history but stubbornly refuses to play 
in the only game in town," an editorial in johannesburg SUNDAY 
STAR in English on 9 January on page 26 notes. While IFP 
"leaders now seem intent on destroying their only hope of access 
to the real political game," IFP leader Buthelezi "knows all 
about the reins of power." But Buthelezi "carries some heavy 
baggage: in the Freedom Alliance, the infantile idea of a 
boerestaat [Boer homeland] and harliners within his central 
committee." "And for months pragmatic IFP leaders have indicated 
their disapproval of hardliners calling the shots." "In this 
context the IFP decision to stay out of the election makes some 
sense. Buthelezi needs time to throw out the baggage and then 
focus his energy and resources to secure power for the IFP in 
Natal. Perhaps Buthelezi is serious about staying out of the 
election. If that is true, he has lost touch with reality." 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  ANC Violence Myths -- While "opinion polls indicate that 
violence is the single biggest concern among all South 
Africans," "the ANC [African National Congress] as the 
government-in-waiting, has shown such ambivalence towards the 
question of policing that it has contributed mightily to the 
growth of lawlessness," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY 
TIMES in English on 9 January on page 18 notes. Its response has 
been "a retreat to mythology. It still clings to the 
`third-force' theory of a government-orchestrated campaign of 
destabilisation against it." The editorial considers the ANC 
logic "faulty," as the police are "largely impotent," stripped 
of their "dreadful array of powers," "keeping their heads down." 
The ANC's response has been to "establish its own self-defense 
units. It has neither the skill nor the discipline to keep them 
in check. Banditry has consumed places like the East Rand." 
"Caught between the impotence of the police and the incompetence 
of the ANC, the criminals and political warlords have 
flourished." The ANC must "make a decisive break with the past. 
It must accept the existing police force, defective as it may 
be, is the nucleus of the force that it will have to use after 
April 27" and "discipline among ANC members must be enforced." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  ANC Election List `Mishmash' -- The ANC PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region issued its list of nominees 
for the provincial legislature and the National Assembly last 
week, which included "people who are not ANC members or are 
known not to share the same values with those of the ANC or any 
of its allied organisations," an editorial in Johannesburg 
SUNDAY NATION in English on 9 January on page 8 notes. "We doubt 
whether this is a wise move from the ANC leadership. Our 
understanding of the ANC is that it is an organisation that grew 
into what it is today by upholding certain values. To uphold 
these values would then be a prerequisite for anyone wanting to 
join the ANC, let alone being one of its leaders." Now, it seems 
"that the ANC first sought to appoint leaders and then hoped 
that they would imbibe ANC values. This is a recipe for 
disaster." The "other disturbing feature" is that the ANC "made 
the list public without informing some of the nominees." "We 
hope that next week's ANC national list conference will take 
account of these issues and take the necessary corrective 
measures before all other things go wrong."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Call To Disband SDUs -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English 
on 7 January in its page 6 editorial thinks it "would be better 
if the ANC [African National Congress] immediately disbanded all 
SDUs [Self-Defense Units] that are causing trouble and phased 
out the rest. After all, the 10,000-strong National 
Peacekeeping Force is about to be formed and trained and will be 
deployed not later than the end of March. We never thought SDUs 
were necessary in the first place -- and recent events show what 
an undisciplined and dangerous crowd some of them are." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  TEC Must Intervene in SAP-PAC Dispute -- The death of a 
14-year- old boy in a clash between South African Police, SAP, 
and Pan- Africanist Congress, PAC, supporters in Gugulethu near 
Cape Town, "has aggravated an already tense situation," declares 
a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 10 
January. The SAP and Transkei have both appealed to the 
Transitional Executive Council, TEC, to intervene, and "so it 
should. But the Transkei demand -- voiced by its military ruler 
Bantu Holomisa -- that the TEC should appoint an independent 
commission composed of foreigners should be rejected. The TEC 
has a chance to prove that it can help South Africans to resolve 
their own disputes. It must accept the challenge." 
  `Tenuous' ANC Hold on Self-Defense Units -- Patrick Laurence 
writes in an article on the same page that the "tenuous hold" of 
the ANC on township SDUs, "some of which are spinning 
dangerously out of control," is "hardly reassuring, particularly 
because of the ANC's status as government-in-waiting." Laurence 
cites "discontent among former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation -- MK] members" as contributing to the "threat posed by 
out of control SDUs. Many former MK members are ensconced in 
SDUs." The formation of the National Peacekeeping Force and the 
emergence of a new national defense force "may help by providing 
work for MK members who want to serve as soldiers in a 
'liberated' South Africa." Ultimately, what South Africa needs 
is 'a political settlement which will make private armies, 
including SDUs, obsolete." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Banks Suspend Mortgage Loans to East Rand Townships -- "The 
row over the major banks' decision to suspend mortgage lending 
to the East Rand townships is, like other politically rooted 
disputes, unlikely to be solved until a government committed to 
restoring law and order is in place," points out a page 6 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 January. 
"The bank's position is understandable. One third of mortgage 
loans to blacks are in arrears, with a far higher proportion on 
the East Rand. Anarchy there prevents the banks from servicing 
loans or valuing properties. It is unclear is arrears are due 
to hardship, anarchy or bond boycotts. But nothing will be 
resolved even by a new government if anarchy persists." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Call To Abolish Internal Security Act -- The PAC has been 
"inconsistent and equivocal in its statements on violence and 
terrorist outrages such as the Heidelberg atrocity," notes a 
page 4 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 5 
January. They have "only themselves to blame" if there is 
little public sympathy for the Western Cape PAC leaders who have 
been detained for interrogation under Section 29 of the Internal 
Security Act, ISA. However, the use of the ISA is "retrograde 
and wholly unacceptable." The country should be "turning its 
back on this kind of thing, which is a travesty of law. It is 
up to the TEC to put a stop to it. You cannot fight barbarism 
with barbarism."

  [Text] The Central Supreme Court announced today that the 
release on 4th January of Oromo Liberation Front [OLF] officials 
Lencho Leta and Ibsa Gutema was a measure taken by the 
government and the Ministry of Justice out of the legal 
procedure. 
  Supreme Court Judge President Desalegn Alemu Kibret said in 
a 
press statement that the two defendants the court knows to be in 
custody have been ordered to appear before court on 10th January. 
  Mr. Kibret said that although the prosecutor has the right 
to 
revoke the charges he had levelled at the accused, but this 
should be made clear to the court which handled the case, and 
added that, if not, neither the prosecutor nor any other 
authority has the right to release the individuals who have been 
jailed under a court order. 
  Accordingly, the Supreme Court has ordered the central 
investigation to bring the two defendants before court on 10th 
January and summoned Justice Minister Mehitema Soloman and 
deputy prosecutor, Zeru Meles, Prison Police Chief Yemane Fisea, 
and Central Investigation head Zeray Yihdego to give 
explanations on the same day how the two were released without 
the court's order.

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today in 
Kabarnet met the foreign ministers of the four countries who are 
charged by the Intergovernmental Authority on Drouught and 
Development, IGADD, to oversee the peace process in the Sudan. 
President Moi is the chairman of the IGADD peace initiative. 
  The four ministers, who have been holding a meeting in 
Nairobi between 4 and 6 January this year, are Mr. Kalonzo 
Musyoka, Kenya's minister for foreign affairs and international 
cooperation; Dr. Paul Ssemogerere, second deputy prime minister 
and minister for foreign affairs of Uganda; Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, 
Ethiopia's minister for foreign affairs; and Mr. Yemane Gabreab, 
Eritrea's minister for foreign affairs. The four ministers for 
foreign affairs briefed President Moi about the progress of 
their meeting, which followed a preliminary one held by the 
heads of state of the four countries in Kampala, Uganda. 
  President Moi said he was personally pleased with the 
outcome 
of the meeting, adding that he will inform his fellow heads of 
state accordingly. He added that he was especially happy to 
note that the Khartoum government was represented in the 
meeting. The president explained that the Nairobi meeting was 
to prepare an agenda for a meeting to be convened soon among the 
four heads of state. 
  During their meeting in Nairobi, the four foreign affairs 
ministers met with all the parties to the conflict and agreed in 
principle to all the issues covered by the meeting. The 
ministers during the meeting also met with Dr. John Garang, 
leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, SPLM-SPLA 
[Sudanese People's Liberation Army], Dr. Riak Machar, leader of 
the SPLA-United, and the Sudanese Government delegation led by 
the minister for peace, Mr. 'Abdallah Deng [Niyal].

  [Text] The government today expressed confidence in the 
manner in which the director of the Kenya Wildlife Service 
[KWS], Dr. Richard Leakey, was running the organization. 
  Addressing an international press conference in his office, 
the minister for tourism and wildlife, Mr. Noah Katana Ngala, 
however said the government was taking the allegations of 
mismanagement at kws very seriously and investigations on the 
reported malpractices have already commenced. 
  Mr. Ngala said there was indication that the parastatal had 
violated the law in its operations, including its own act, and 
warned stern action will be taken against those involved in 
irregular activities. He said the ministry, in conjuction with 
the auditor-general cooperations [as heard], was looking into 
allegations of improper employment and payment of irregular 
salaries to some of the staff at the organization. He said it 
was irresponsible for some people to claim that unqualified 
personnel were being employed and their tax-free salaries pegged 
to the dollar without the authority of both the organization's 
board of trustees and the minister for finance. 
  The minister said he had documentary evidence some 
recruitment by the organization was being done of favoritism and 
not on qualifications and that salaries are being fixed 
arbitrarily by the management without any reference to the board 
of trustees. He said it had also come to the ministry's notice 
that certain major policy matters had been implemented by the 
management without approval of the board and the organization 
was involved in illegal collection of funds from the members of 
the public. 
  Other issues being investigated include the translocation of 
the animals from the national parks to private sanctuaries, 
where owners were charging fees and while the organization was 
operating on huge unauthorized bank overdrafts. 
  He assured the residents of Narok that the government has no 
intention of handing over Masai Mara Game Reserve to KWS. He 
appealed to the public to give the ministry ample time to 
complete its investigations, adding that appropriate measures 
will be taken to correct the situation.

  [Text] The leader of the breakaway Somaliland republic, 
which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, said today in 
Nairobi that the United Nations should leave Somalis to settle 
their own problems. President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, addressing 
supporters after lengthy talks with faction leader Mohamed Farah 
Aidid, said the United Nations should not portray Aidid as a 
monster. He said the United Nations does not understand the 
complexity of the Somali problem. 
  UN troops last year clashed with supporters of General 
Aidid, 
the strongman of southern Mogadishu, and he was declared a 
wanted man for murderous attacks on Pakistani peacekeeping 
soldiers. The hunt for him has subsequently been called off.

  [Text] Dr. Hasan Ali Mireh, the Somali Salvation Alliance 
[SSA] spokesman in Nairobi, Kenya has described reports 
published by THE NATION newspaper of Nairobi as unfounded, 
fabricated lies. The reports said recently that representatives 
of the SSA from the 12 organizations and the Somali National 
Alliance [SNA] have met. The spokesman noted that the last 
meeting between the SSA and the SNA was the one held in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia in December, and that there had never been any 
other meeting since. Dr. Hasan Ali described such reports as 
having emanated from people who did not (?know) the truth, the 
methodology of journalism, or the right of a person to express 
factual truths. 
  Dr. Mireh said that the SSA committee for negotiations 
responsible for talking with the SNA is meeting unilaterally in 
Mogadishu, and is streamlining ways of continuing with 
December's Addis Ababa talks.

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 9 (AFP) -- A pregnant Somali woman 
was shot dead by US soldiers Sunday [9 January] while selling 
tea in a south Mogadishu street, witnesses said. 
  The shots were fired from a nearby control post held by a 
Pakistani contingent of UN troops, one of whom said his US 
colleagues opened fire after spotting a Somali bearing a 
submachine gun. 
  US officers said Sunday they had launched an inquiry into 
the 
incident but refused to comment further. 
  Women in the area at the time said they heard one or two 
gunshots and saw the woman collapse after being hit in the 
stomach. The witnesses said she was aged about 30 and pregnant. 
  A member of staff at the nearby Benadir Hospital was wounded 
Friday by US gunfire, while two other Somalis were killed by US 
and Pakistani peacekeepers Thursday.

  [Text] The UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] troops stationed 
at the American Embassy building in Mogadishu last night at 2300 
fired on a Banaadir Hospital worker who was in the hospital's 
doctors' residence. Mr. Amar Abdilleh Issaq, a senior nurse, 
had his left arm smashed by the UNOSOM troops' shots at Banaadir 
Hospital. 
  The director of the Banaadir Hospital, Dr. 'Abd al-Razaq 
Hasan Ali, told journalists today that the UNOSOM troops fired 
on the hospital through a window facing the UNOSOM base at the 
American Embassy. The hospital director said that this 
appalling act by UNOSOM troops is inexplicable since in all 
situations hospitals and medical centers are to be spared from 
such acts. The UNOSOM troops are aware and have a written 
explanation of all the areas forming the main Banaadir Hospital. 
The director of Banaadir Hospital, Dr. 'Abd al-Razaq Hasan Ali, 
said these sort of acts have been committed in the past against 
the hospital by UNOSOM troops. He lastly called on world human 
rights organizations, world health organizations and others to 
condemn the annihilation of patients and doctors targeted by 
UNOSOM troops in breach of the international code for hospitals.

  [Text] Pakistani troops who are part of the mercenary 
forces of UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] dumped refuse at the 
(Damanya) Base of the Somali Armed Forces. On 5 January a 
reporter from the Voice of the Great Somali People who witnessed 
the incident said that while the Pakistani troops were dumping 
the refuse, the residents of the area attempted to stop them 
from causing environmental damage. The Pakistani troops 
answered the civilians by opening fire with automatic weapons, 
wounding three persons -- a woman and two children. 
  Also, showing the declared hatred of the Somali people by 
UNOSOM troops -- and especially the U.S. Forces -- yesterday 
U.S. Forces fired on a Somali who was passing by the American 
Embassy -- the innocent and defenseless Somali man died on the 
spot.

visited the prime minister at his home in (Osterbay) in Dar es 
Salaam to brief him on the prevailing situation in Burundi. 
During the talks, the OAU secretary general briefed Hon.

  [Text] The Burundi-African Alliance for Salvation, ABASA, 
today held an extraordinary meeting with only one item on its 
agenda: The candidature for the post of president of the 
republic of Dr. Jean Ndederi, a lecturer at Burundi University 
and general adviser of the party. 
  At the end of the meeting, the executive committee 
unanimously decided to support his candidature and called on him 
to swiftly perform the required administrative formalities in 
accordance with the Constitution and the electoral laws. 
  Meanwhile, the ABASA secretary general, Mr. Sadiki Ruvako 
Dieudonne, has resigned from the ABASA party. He feels that, 
quote: Since the beginning of the 21 October 1993 crisis in 
which the lamented Melchior Ndadaye, president of the republic, 
was assassinated in a cowardly way along with some of his close 
collaborators, he has been witnessing with regret the political 
harassment orchestrated against the remaining government members 
by the opposition parties, including ABASA, end quote. Mr. 
Sadiki Ruvako Dieudonne feels that before his compatriots and 
his conscience, he finds it very painful to defend a policy in 
which he does not believe, and he has therefore taken the firm 
decision to resign from the ABASA party.

  [Text] Yaounde, 7 Jan (AFP) -- A reliable source has stated 
that the managing editor of the weekly LE NOUVEL INDEPENDANT, 
published in Yaounde, was arrested on 7 January at his home by 
policemen, and was then taken to a police station in the capital. 
  The reasons for the arrest were not known this morning. 
However, Issue No. 15 of the newspaper, which was supposed to 
be published on 6 January, was seized at the printing house by 
administrative authorities. The paper was then suspended. 
  LE NOUVEL INDEPENDANT has distinguished itself these past 
weeks by publishing articles denouncing some scandals within the 
corridors of power. 
  On the other hand, it has been reported that PERSPECTIVE 
HEBDO, another independent newspaper published in Douala, the 
economic capital of the country, has also been suspended. 
According to the managing editor, Mr. Joseph-Marie Bessery, the 
previous issue had already been seized. 
  PRESPECTIVE HEBDO, which investigated sports scandals which 
have taken place over the past few weeks in Cameroon, published 
in this issue an investigation concerning the scandal that 
rocked the former Cameroon Bank Society, which was declared 
brankrupt in 1991.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Congolese Government 
has adopted a social and economic recovery program which 
provides for 20 to 35 percent reduction in salaries of the 
country's 80,000 civil servants, a parliamentary source said 
here today. This reduction, which is aimed at bringing down the 
annual wage bill from 134 to 84 billion CFA francs, will not 
affect low income earners and will be negotiated by the 
government and civil service unions, the same source added. 
  The government will encourage early voluntary retirement and 
the redeployment of part of the civil service force, through 
"backup measures" that will be implemented with the help of the 
French Development Agency [CFD], the World Bank, and the 
European Union. The plan provides for about 15 billion CFA 
francs savings through the reduction of public expenditure, 
notably in the sectors of water consumption, electricity, and 
telephone; the reduction of diplomatic staff; and the adoption 
of a new system of teaching scholarship awards. 
  The government hopes to improve fiscal and customs revenue 
so 
as to limit the share of oil revenue which accounts for 70 
percent of budget resources. According to official estimates, 
the package of measures are expected to bring in "additional 27 
billion CFA francs" each year. The plan also provides for the 
"restructuring of the status and the mode of management" of 
major public and semi-public enterprises. 
  The state company in charge of the marketing of hydrocarbons 
-- Hydro-Congo -- will lose its distribution monopoly and the 
Transcongo Communication Agency will be broken up into three 
autonomous units. Regarding the debt which hit the figure of 
1.600 billion CFA in 1993, the plan provides for a "300 billion 
CFA francs bridge-credit," over ten years, with two years grace 
period and an interest rate not exceeding 5 percent. This 
credit will be used to make an early payment of the 135 billion 
CFA secured debt and to clear 50 billion CFA francs multilateral 
arrears, of which 35 billion CFA are owed to the CFD. 
  The rest of the credit will be put into a Reserve, 
Stabilization, and Economic Diversification Fund. The granting 
of this credit presupposes prior agreement with the IMF. This 
will enable the country's debt to benefit from a special 
treatment from the Paris and London clubs.

  [Text] We begin this newscast with a report on a ceremony 
at which New Year's wishes were presented to Mr. and Mrs. 
Casimir Oye-Mba. The ceremony began at 0930 local time at the 
ceremonies hall of the Intercontinental Hotel at (?Koume Palace) 
and was marked by speeches from Higher Education Minister Michel 
Anchouey and (Yves Oualele), secretary general at the Office of 
the Prime Minister, and by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba. 
Moussa Mounguegui, you were present at this ceremony. Please, 
summarize what transpired: 
  [Mounguegui] On behalf of his fellow cabinet members, the 
minister of higher education praised the job done by the prime 
minister as manager of Omar Bongo's presidential campaign and as 
head of government, a government that ably handled the 
transition period from the national conference to the 
organization of presidential elections on 5 December last year. 
In spite of the unfavorable social and political atmosphere, 
the government did not fail in its mission. Those who compose 
the adminstration are happy to work with Mr. Oye-Mba, Minister 
Michel Anchouey added. 
  The secretary general at the Office of the Prime Minister 
observed that 1993 was rich in lessons, and hoped that 1994 
would be marked by new vitality. Mr. (Yves Oualele) seized the 
opportunity to present to the head of government workers' 
overall concerns. Beside duties, the worker also has rights. 
For this reason, the secretary general at the Office of the 
Prime Minister called for the setting up a higher civil service 
council as soon as possible. 
  In his reply, the head of government acknowledged that 1993 
was rich in events and lessons. For him, 1994 will enable us to 
evaluate these lessons. Now that the transition period has 
ended with the presidential election, deservingly won by Mr. 
Omar Bongo, Mr. Casimir Oye-Mba made it a point to caution, in 
his words, those who are making capital out of Mr. Bongo's 
victory. To his detractors, the prime minister stated that he 
was not yet finished, and that he remained cool and composed. 
The head of government congratulated his cabinet and office 
aides for the work they have done. To workers, the prime 
minister gave the reminder that rights and duties go hand in 
hand. Mr. Oye-Mba then expressed the government's intention to 
resume discussions with international finance institutions. In 
conclusion, he expressed the following wishes to Gabon and its 
people. He was speaking to Philippe Tonda: 
  [Begin Bongo recording] I wish our country peace, civil 
peace, without which nothing can ever be undertaken, or built. 
My wish for our our country is that the political pluralism 
which we have instituted lead us to democracy, because I am 
among those who think that we do not really have democracy yet. 
So far as I am concerned, democracy is not the constitution 
that enshrines it, nor is it just the constitutional court, 
which interprets that constitution, nor is it just the National 
Communications Council, which regulates the audiovisual 
landscape. Democracy is first and foremost accepting other men, 
accepting living with other men, agreeing to live together not 
only with our affinities and similarities -- and, surely, these 
are legion -- but also with our differences and dissimilarities, 
since this is the reality of human nature. Most fortunately in 
our our country, the things that unite us are many. We are a 
small country: 1 million inhabitants on an area of nearly 
290,000 square km --that is really very little. Surely, you 
have gone around Gabon just like me. Our country is empty in 
terms of men. Now, it is men who, in reality, constitute the 
primary wealth of nations. I would like here to reecho an idea 
which has permeated the minds of Gabonese, and according to 
which the fact of our country being so richly endowed by nature 
is enough. I say that is not true. My wish as we enter 1994 is 
that democracy really take root in the daily behavior of each 
one of us, in our actions and in our attitudes, in our way of 
reasoning and, once more -- hopefully -- in our hearts. My wish 
also is that our country settle down to work and that it restore 
growth. A short while ago, you mentioned the prescriptions of 
the Bretton Woods institutions. I contend that we must resume 
talks with the IMF and the World Bank, not because I consider 
their therapies to be always correct -- not at all. In fact, I 
know a thing or two about these institutions. But in the world 
as it is today we have no choice -- we have no choice. So we 
must resume active -- since there has never been a complete 
break -- discussions with these institutions. In fact, it is 
very easy to lay the blame on the Bretton Woods institutions. 
But if we did not have problems, we would not be compelled to 
go and see people in Washington. It is up to us to manage to 
develop our potentials and manage our resources in such a way 
that we never find it necessary to go and see the people in 
Washington. [end recording]

  [Text] The president of the republic, Major General Juvenal 
Habyarimana, yesterday received at Urugwiro Village the Rwanda 
Patriotic Front [RPF] delegation, led by its first vice 
president, Patrick Mazimpaka. The meeting lasted several hours, 
and attempted to find ways and means of alleviating some 
difficulties obstructing the establishment of transitional, 
broadbased institutions. 
  The two parties agreed to pursue consultations in order to 
bring the crisis out of deadlock, particularly with the Liberal 
Party [PL] and Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], and they 
reiterated their support for the Arusha Peace Accord. According 
to Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka some parties were demanding the 
revision of the Arusha agreements. 
  The groups did not fix a date for the establishment of the 
remaining transitional institutions, but the head of state 
promised to pursue a dialogue with the concerned parties so that 
a date for their establishment can be fixed. 
  It is worth noting that the RPF maintains as valid the list 
of the PL deputies elected before the 37 days (?in accordance) 
with the Arusha Accord signature. [sentence as heard] The prime 
minister of the current transitional government, Madame Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, also participated in the meeting, together with 
the special representatives of the secretaries general of the 
United Nations and OAU, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh Booh and (Joe 
Felly) respectively, while the Tanzanian ambassador to Rwanda 
represented the facilitator. The RPF delegation also included 
Jacques Bihozagara, Pasteur Bizimungu, Seth Sendashonga and Tite 
Rutaremara.

  [Text] The Popular Movement of the Revolution [MPR] held a 
general assembly meeting on 8 January. It was presided over by 
the first deputy chairman, (Banza Moukala Yissoungou). 
Professor Kongote Kagna, MPR spokesman, has the details: 
  [Begin Kagna recording] Steering committee and MPR 
parliamentarians held a meeting on 8 January at party 
headquarters under the chairmanship of the party's first deputy 
chairman, Mr. Banza Moukala Yissoungou. They examined the 
current social, economic, and political situation in light of 
President Mobutu's 4 January address to the nation. At the end 
of the meeting, the steering committee issued the following 
statement: 
  1. The MPR totally endorses President Mobutu's analysis of 
the socioeconomic crisis the country is grappling with, which 
has been exacerbated by monetary reform problems. 
  2. On a political level, the MPR urges political leaders not 
to hold the Zairian people, who are facing overwhelming misery, 
at ransom because of their own personal ambitions. It therefore 
calls on political leaders to sign without delay the protocol 
agreement and final report on the Palais du Peuple proceedings, 
which they negotiated of their own accord. The MPR encourages 
the head of state to effectively assume his responsibility 
should the political class disqualify themselves, through their 
own doing on 12 January, to put an end to the people's misery. 
  3. The MPR thinks that no democrat should shun free, fair, 
and democratic elections, which is why it gives unreserved 
support to the holding of elections at all levels to enable the 
people to choose their representatives. Finally, the MPR takes 
this opportunity to wish the Zairian people happiness and 
prosperity for 1994. 
  Issued: Kinshasa on 8 January. 
  Signed: (Banza Moukala Yissoungi), first deputy chairman in 
charge of coordinating party activities. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Ntumba Matulu commentary] </F>
  [Excerpt] Today, we continue our series of commentaries on 
the important New Year message by head of state Marshal Mobutu 
Sese Seko to the nation on 4 January. 
  Reviewing the state of the nation in order to take stock and 
reflect on the consequences of about four years of hesitation 
and confusion, Marshal Mobutu dwelt in his speech on economic 
and political harmony in our country. 
  It is often said: Give me sound politics and I will give you 
a sound economy. But what can be expected when we observe that 
the president himself cries angrily at this laconic order and I 
quote: It is enough! Enough is enough! In any case, by this, 
one can understand, if I may say, politics has precedence over 
the economy. One can then ask to know if it is the latter that 
commands the former -- or vice versa. Upon analysis and on 
account of the situation currently prevailing in Zaire and the 
world, one thing is certain: If it is true that the bad conduct 
of the political game annoys the [word indistinct] of the 
economy to the point of causing even confusion, no one can deny 
that the ruin of the economy has finally made the political 
sector nervous and has led to the economy's modification, just 
as economic successes contribute to the reinforcement of 
political stands. 
  Concerning Zaire, our country, one can note that at the 
beginning, it was, above all, the serious economic difficulties 
and the unrest that ensued that forced our people to question 
the institutions of the Second Republic and demand change. As 
one can observe, the detonator for democratization was economic. 
But later, when there was hesitation and other acts of 
tardiness and stalemate in the machinery of democratization, it 
was economic arguments that external partners resorted to in 
order to continue the process of political reform. 
  At the home level, we can remark that any time there is 
something wrong in the democratic mechanism for one reason or 
the other, it is the economic weapon that is resorted to in 
order to make things work once again: Unlimited strikes are 
decreed, civil disobedience is called for, industrial units are 
attacked, and in commerce, the transportation network is 
targeted. In short, people want to paralyze the economy and 
prevent the government from working in order to force it to 
change its mind and orientate its policies to a given direction. 
  In the light of all these arguments, there is no doubt that 
the economy controls politics, hence the president of the 
Republic's recommendation to his fellow citizens to behave in 
such a way that 1994 may be a year of national redress.

  [Text] The deliberations of the National Convention of 
Forces of Change [CNFC]'s general assembly, which began 
yesterday morning, ended at the Institute for Social, Economic, 
and Civil Training in Cotonou. Participants adopted two reports: 
one on the organization of the next elections and the other on 
the moralization of public life. The general assembly made a 
series of recommendations concerning these elections in order to 
ensure their openness and democratic character. It urged 
political parties to thoroughly examine the possibility of 
creating a national and independent electoral commission. This 
commission will be charged with organizing, handling, and 
controlling the elections. The general assembly also proposed 
that the maximum number of voters for each polling station be 
500 in order to facilitate the counting of votes on the spot 
with immediate exhibition of the results under the supervision 
of the local electoral commissions. 
  As for the moralization of public life, the convention 
deplored the fact many commissions have been set up - one after 
the other - to almost no avail since the period preceding the 
national conference up to now. According to the parties of the 
convention, the moralization should be carried out at various 
levels, first of all in the public finance sector which needs 
reorganization, openness, and control. The second level is the 
ruling class, whose will to serve should prevail over the spirit 
of enjoyment. As for civil servants, a change in their daily 
behavior is imperative, and it is a duty for businessmen to 
clear their debt with the banks. The moralization at the level 
of the mass media means that an end should be put to the use of 
the state media houses for the cult of personality, as is the 
case at the national television now, the convention stressed. 
  In his closing speech, Idelphonse Lemon, current chairman of 
the convention, was obviously satisfied with the general 
assembly's recommendations. This satisfaction made him say that 
the guards of the democracy temple in Benin have gathered within 
the CNFC, which is good for the Republic. Let us listen to him: 
  [Begin Lemon recording] The Republic will always survive, 
but in an improved environment, where on the authorities' side, 
the will to serve will prevail over the spirit of enjoyment, 
where the fruit of growth will be fairly distributed, where the 
zone of poverty will be gradually cleared, and where the birds 
of darkness will be prevented from flying. Long live the 
Republic! Long live the opposition! [end recording]

  Angola: UNITA pleased with meeting with US congressmen 
  [Text] Today, in Lusaka, the UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] delegation met a group of U.S. 
congressmen who have been visiting Angola. The UNITA men were 
pleased with the meeting. 
  [Reporter] UNITA returned visibly pleased from the meeting 
with the U.S. Democratic congressmen. Jorge Valentim said that 
the meeting had gone very well and that the congressmen had 
expressed the United States' willingness to play an important 
role in the Angolan peace process at all levels. He expressed 
satisfaction at the level of the debate and the positive 
attitude of the congressmen regarding the Angolan problem, of 
which many aspects were broached, according to Valentim. When 
questioned about the shelling which prevented the congressmen 
from landing in Malanje, Valentim declined to answer. He 
insisted that the focal point of the meeting was the problem of 
peace in Angola.

on the occasion of the eighty-second anniversary of the ANC, 
delivered by President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela," issued on the 
SAPA PR Wire Service on 8 January 1994] 
  [Text] Compatriots: Today, we mark the 82nd anniversary of 
the ANC [African National Congress]. We do so in very special 
circumstances. We have arrived at an historic watershed. 1994 
is the year in which our country will hold its first ever 
democratic elections. 
  The dreams and the vision of the great patriots who formed 
the ANC are about to be realised. The hopes of the millions who 
sacrificed for the realisation of that vision are, at last, 
about to be fulfilled. Within a few months, all our people 
will, as equals, exercise their inalienable and sacred right to 
determine the destiny of our country. When the day of 
liberation dawns, then shall South Africa, at last, say farewell 
to over three centuries of injustice, racial oppression and 
exploitation. As we celebrate these victories, we will, at the 
same time, be saying farewell to conflict and war, suffering and 
despair. 
<H5>  Fountain of Inspiration </H5>
  As we advance towards the new, we carry with us the great 
pride that millions of our people, both black and white, among 
them the heroic combatants of Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing] defied all dangers and death 
itself, to achieve these successes. The heroines and heroes who 
joined the great offensive for national emancipation and 
democracy are legion. Their actions will forever remain a 
fountain of inspiration for the generations that will be charged 
with the defence and further consolidation of our freedom, 
liberty and human rights. The names of the countless martyrs 
who sacrificed everything for the liberation of all our people 
are registered in the indelible record of our country's forward 
march across the boundaries that separate centuries. The 
united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South Africa which 
will soon be our prize, will be the living tribute to their 
endeavours, courage and nobility of spirit. It will be the 
guarantee that their struggle was not in vain. 
<H5>  Victory for All </H5>
  Today we speak of democratic elections, of liberation and of 
freedom, justice and peace because these millions dared to stand 
up, as they continue to do to this day, to say no to oppression, 
exploitation and war. The victory they sought was for all the 
people of our country. It was not their objective then, and is 
not our aim now, to produce a society of conquerors and the 
conquered. It was their aim then as it is our objective now, to 
liberate all and subjugate none. 
  When the celebrations come, they must therefore salute a 
common homecoming to a common homeland. They must pay tribute 
to our collective wisdom as South Africans. They must express 
joy in our common discovery of the national will which, forged 
in conflict, directed and enabled us to reach across the burning 
embers of that confrontation, to end the conflict. 
  The past year has seen us lay down important additional 
foundation stones for the edifice of freedom which we seek to 
build. I refer, in particular, to the milestones represented by 
the adoption of the transitional constitution and the 
establishment of the Transitional Executive Council as well as 
other structures charged with the task of preparing for the 
elections. 
<H5>  Tribute to Martyrs </H5>
  What a cruel turn of history it has been that during the 
very 
year that we took these important strides forward, we lost such 
outstanding leaders of our people and important architects of 
the democratic victory, as Oliver Tambo and Chris Hani. To them 
and others who have lost their lives during this past year, 
especially those who have been cut down as a result of the 
continuing political violence, we reiterate our homage. We 
pledge to them that we shall forever remain loyal to the cause 
for which they laid down their lives. 
<H5>  Free and Fair Elections </H5>
  During this year, as a country and a people, we must 
discharge the common responsibility we share of ensuring that 
each and everyone of our people freely exercises his or her 
hard-won right to elect a government of his or her choice. 
Acting together, we must ensure that the people continue, in 
practice, to be their own liberators by participating in 
elections that are truly free and fair. 
  The litmus test both of our democratic credentials, 
individually and collectively, and the genuineness of the 
democratic order, must be whether the elections are in fact free 
and fair. All the necessary conditions must therefore be 
created to ensure that all voters, in the towns and the 
countryside, participate in the elections and participate 
without spoiling their ballot papers. We must therefore all 
consider it our national task to organise so that every eligible 
voter has the necessary means of identification, that each voter 
knows how to vote and that each voter reaches a voting station 
during the election days. 
  Equally important, it is our common national task to 
guarantee that no voter is intimidated such that either he or 
she does not participate in the election or votes in a manner 
contrary to what his or her conscience and conviction dictates. 
<H5>  Stop the Blood-Letting </H5>
  Of central importance is the issue of political violence. 
The imperative of peace demands that the carnage must end. The 
democratic transition and human decency demand that the blood- 
letting must stop. The time has come that the people should 
judge the killers for what they are -- murderers who must be 
punished according to their just deserts, assassins whom the 
voters must reject as the very enemies of democracy, purveyors 
of death who cannot be allowed to assume power through terror. 
  From the very beginning of the establishment of the new 
democracy, let us therefore make it clear that what underwrites 
the permanence of that democracy is our common commitment to 
peace. We must not permit anyone to use force to deny the 
unfettered exercise of the will of the people, regardless of the 
arms the enemies of democracy bear and regardless of the 
brutality of their terror. Together we must bring to naught the 
evil intentions of the enemies of democracy and peace, whose 
callous actions have already resulted in the loss of the lives 
of thousands of innocent people. 
<H5>  Resistance to Change </H5>
  There are some who, out of fear for the future or too blind 
an attachment to the past, seek to stop what is just and 
inevitable, through force of arms. The very point we have 
reached after three centuries of conflict and confrontation and 
a determined resistance to change, speaks of the futility of 
this project. 
  The question that history confronts us with is not whether 
South Africa shall be a democratic country. The question that 
the opponents of change force onto the national agenda is 
whether that democratic order will come after a conflict that 
will have turned our country into a wasteland. 
  The reality must be accepted by all of us that change is the 
basic condition for our existence as a country, for our survival 
as a people, for the achievement of peace, justice, prosperity 
and stability for all. 
  On this historic occasion in the life of our country, we 
therefore call on those who yearn for the false stability of 
injustice to understand this fully. They should learn that 
their own survival, their capacity to live as human beings, 
depends on change and not the maintenance of an intolerable 
status quo or the reversion to a forgotten past. We say to them 
that they, too, must become part of the collective wisdom of all 
our people, out of which has been born the realisation that we 
share a common destiny which we must shape together, as equals. 
<H5>  Common Destiny </H5>
  The forthcoming elections are not just about the demise of 
the old order. They begin a process by which the old must yield 
to the new. They constitute the first step of our entry into 
the modern political world with its concepts and practices of 
democracy, fundamental human rights and equality among the 
peoples without discrimination on grounds of gender, race, 
colour or belief. 
  The elections will move our country into a new epoch, 
enabling all of humanity to take the last step to close the 
chapter of colonialism which was first imposed on Africa with 
the establishment of the Portuguese colonial empire, five 
hundred years ago. 
<H5>  Government of the People </H5>
  In our fifth month this year, our country will be ruled by a 
government born out of this new epoch. This will be a 
government which, for the first time in our history, will justly 
claim authority because it will be based on the will of the 
people. Its central task will be the transformation of South 
Africa into a true example of what constitutes the modern world. 
  The first challenge of that interim government of national 
unity will be to begin the process of dismantling apartheid and 
transforming South Africa into a democratic, non-racial and non- 
sexist country. To dismantle apartheid means to return South 
Africa to the hands of all her people. This is the fundamental 
thrust that must inform the programme of reconstruction and 
development which this government will have to implement. 
  The old order has plunged our country into a general crisis 
affecting all spheres of human endeavour. As a result of the 
policies representative of an old epoch, the economy has failed 
to feed all our people. It has failed to house them and to 
provide them with jobs. It has failed to provide them with good 
education, to give them access to good health services -- in 
short, to provide them with an acceptable and improving quality 
of life. 
  South Africa's relations with the world economy continue to 
be characterised by its colonial origins, resulting in 
dependence on the export of raw materials and agricultural 
products and an inability to compete effectively in terms of 
modern industrial products. The state institutions lack 
legitimacy and are not accepted by the overwhelming majority of 
our people as being dedicated to ensuring the public good. 
Rather they are seen as seats of injustice, affected by rampant 
corruption, structured and programmed to serve a tiny minority 
at the expense of the majority. 
<H5>  Culture of Violence </H5>
  Fear of death and injury continue to stalk our land. No one, 
old or young, black or white, in the towns and the countryside, 
feels safe. The old order, which could only survive on the 
basis of violence and brute force, has infused our society with 
a culture of violence. We are today reaping the fruits of that 
heritage in the form of massive criminal violence, including the 
abuse of women and children, violence within families as well as 
political thuggery and terrorism. 
  History has blessed our country with a nation made up of 
people with different colours and cultures. The old order 
sought to use this reality, which should be a source of joy and 
strength, as an instrument for the perpetuation and entrenchment 
of injustice, oppression and exploitation. As a consequence of 
the encouragement of a destructive racial and ethnic chauvinism, 
we are today faced with some in our midst who would seek to 
undermine the process of reconciliation and nation building by 
appealing to dangerous and primitive instincts of racial and 
ethnic exclusiveness. 
<H5>  Injustice to Women </H5>
  We have also inherited a social structure and social mores 
which have condemned the women of our country to the ranks of 
the most oppressed and exploited. This has meant the all-round 
and sustained suppression of half of our population to the grave 
detriment not only of the women themselves but to our country as 
a whole. This grave injustice has been codified into law, 
justified by an appeal to tradition and sustained by a crude 
ideology which trumpets the superiority of the male over the 
female. 
<H5>  South Africa Belongs to All Who Live in It </H5>
  The old order we shall replace has also damaged and 
undermined our country's relations with the rest of the world. 
South Africa became the seat of aggression and destabilisation, 
inflicting enormous damage on the countries of southern Africa. 
The loss of our independence and, later, South Africa's 
rightful isolation by the nations of the world, have produced a 
set of relations which became part of and an expression of the 
general crisis produced by the persistence of a social and 
political system whose time had long passed. 
  In this year of liberation, the people of South Africa must 
insist that the new government will only earn their trust and 
respect if it engages in a serious and determined programme to 
end this general crisis by returning our country to all its 
people, so that we can truly say that South Africa belongs to 
all who live in it, both black and white. 
<H5>  Reconstruction and Development </H5>
  Many things will therefore have to be done to rebuild the 
economy. These measures must ensure that this economy serves 
the interests of all our people, enabling us to raise the living 
standards of the poor. At the same time, it must attain high 
and sustainable rates of growth. Furthermore, steps will have 
to be taken so that our country's resources are allocated and 
distributed in such a way that we can begin to end the racial 
disparities in terms of the distribution of wealth, income and 
opportunity. 
  Many things will also have to be done to restructure the 
organs of government so that they are representative of all our 
people. All levels of government must serve the people and 
operate in a climate of transparency, public accountability and 
moral integrity. The ANC commits itself to these objectives. 
<H5>  Peace a Priority </H5>
  The new government will also have to lead the offensive for 
peace, security and stability, building on what has been 
achieved through the National Peace Accord, the activities of 
the national peace keeping force and the peace struggle of the 
masses of the people themselves. This must include improving 
the socio-economic conditions of the people, rebuilding of the 
services responsible for the maintenance of law and order, and 
improving their relationship with the communities they serve. 
  We are confident that the members of Umkhonto We Sizwe, 
integrated into a new national defence force, will play a 
critical role in the achievement of these objectives. 
  Above all, we must draw the people themselves into a 
determined campaign to expunge the curse of violence from our 
society. 
  Through action, the women of our country should also ensure 
that they, the rest of our population and the new government 
focus on the fundamental question of the emancipation of women 
by addressing such matters as their socio-economic upliftment, 
raising their levels of education and training, ensuring their 
participation in decision-making structures and creating the 
conditions for their liberation from demobilisation by household 
chores. 
  Soon our country will take its rightful place among the 
nations. This process will give us the opportunity so to 
position ourselves that we can play our own role in the building 
of a world of peace, freedom and respect for human rights while 
establishing and strengthening a system of mutually beneficial 
relations with the peoples of the world, beginning with the 
countries of southern Africa. 
<H5>  Rise to the Challenge </H5>
  Whatever the details of these programmes, we must ensure 
that 
within a relatively short period of time, our country emerges 
out of the crisis imposed upon it and becomes a true land of 
hope. This we will achieve if, as we must, we begin to build 
new houses, give better education to the youth, raise the 
standard of living of especially the poor, attend to the 
pressing environmental questions, strengthen the spirit of 
solidarity among all our people, ensure peace and security for 
the people and enable the people to govern. 
  In the fight for a healthy population, we must, among other 
things, halt the spread of HIV and AIDS, while treating its 
victims in a humane manner, based on the principles contained in 
the bill of rights. We still have a chance to arrest the 
proliferation of this pandemic. 
  Faced as we are with the terrible inheritance of massive 
unemployment, top priority must be given to the creation of 
jobs. Related to this, we will also have to adopt programmes to 
ensure that those who have been left behind by apartheid, are 
given the opportunity to catch up and work side by side with the 
rest of their compatriots, as people of equal competence. This 
is the true essence of a policy of affirmative action. 
  The question of the protection and the development of 
children must also been given the emphasis and attention it 
deserves. The requisite resources will have to be allocated to 
meet the objectives which the whole world pursues for the 
promotion of the interests of the children. 
  The land hunger which affects many of our people must also 
be 
addressed. We are convinced that this can and must be done 
without threatening those who work the land today and help to 
feed the nation. 
  We must meet all these challenges as a people and not merely 
leave them to the government that we shall all have elected. 
Our success as a country and the very imperative of building a 
genuine democracy, require that all structures of civil society 
should themselves be involved in confronting these challenges. 
These structures, among them the civic organisations, are 
important instruments both of socio-economic development and 
democratic participation in reconstruction. We are confident 
that they will take timely measures to gear themselves to play 
this new role, in keeping with the aspirations of the millions 
they represent, for a decent standard of living, peace and 
stability. We therefore call on all sectors of our population 
to rise to the challenge and join hands for the remaking of our 
country into a common home that we can all be proud of. 
<H5>  The Youth </H5>
  The challenge facing our youth is to remain at the forefront 
of the struggle for change. They must be among those in the 
vanguard of the important effort to ensure that the elections 
are free and fair and among those who must lead in rebuilding 
our country. They, who are the pride and the hope of our 
nation, also have a serious responsibility to prepare themselves 
through education and other means, so that they can both build 
and inherit a future of peace, democracy, prosperity and 
stability. 
<H5>  Efforts of the Working People </H5>
  The prosperity which all our people deeply yearn for will 
come about as a result of the efforts of our working people, who 
have themselves been at the vanguard of the struggle to end the 
system of white minority rule. Continuing in that role, they 
too, under the leadership of their trade unions, have a 
responsibility to help create the conditions of democracy and 
peace which will ensure the creation of new jobs and 
implementation of the economic reconstruction programme, which 
are such a vital part of the process of building the new South 
Africa. 
  It is also critically important that the trade union 
movement 
should continue to make its contribution to the development of a 
national consensus with regard to the objective of building a 
prosperous economy which would end unemployment, provide a 
living wage for all, raise levels of productivity and 
international competitiveness and ensure proper participation by 
workers in decision making at their places of work. 
  There are some among our working people who benefited from 
job reservation and racial discrimination in the past. Some of 
these continue to cling to a misguided hope that the old order 
can be restored. It remains the responsibility of the 
progressive trade union movement to join in the effort to 
persuade these that their fundamental interests can only be 
served by their full participation in the process of democratic 
change. 
<H5>  Central Role of the Religious Community </H5>
  The religious community of our country has also played a 
central role in the struggle to achieve justice and peace for 
all our people. To these great patriots, to whom we reiterate 
our commitment to freedom of worship, we say that the goal you 
set yourselves, inspired by the humanist teachings of all the 
great faiths, has not yet been achieved. 
  In particular we believe that you have a central role to 
play 
in ensuring that the elections are free and fair, by paying 
especial attention to the questions of voter education and 
mobilisation and addressing the critical question of political 
violence. Similarly, an important responsibility rests on your 
shoulders to help ensure genuine reconciliation among all our 
communities and the strengthening of the ties that bind them as 
part of one human family. In addition, we believe that the 
religious community should gear itself to participate in the 
programme for reconstruction and development so that, through 
community based activities, it helps the ordinary people to 
escape from the terrible prison of poverty, deprivation and 
human degradation. 
<H5>  Call to Traditional Leaders </H5>
  We would also like to make a special call to the traditional 
leaders, who have an important role to play in the new society. 
They, too, owe it to the country to ensure that those who fall 
under their jurisdiction are given every possibility to 
participate in the process of the peaceful transformation of our 
country. The new constitution has already given a place to 
these leaders of our people, reflecting the common recognition 
of the important role they must continue to play. That role 
demands of them that, as of old, they must continue to serve the 
interests of the people, in the spirit of our new democracy. 
<H5>  Partnership With Business </H5>
  The business community, both black and white, constitutes an 
important sector of our society and a valuable asset in the 
historic effort to bring a better quality of life to all our 
people. We appeal to these compatriots themselves to play their 
part in building confidence in the future of our country. The 
critical and positive decisions which they take will impact on 
the welfare of the millions of our people as well as the success 
of the democratic transition itself. We are committed to join 
hands with them in a partnership for progress and change, for 
peace and stability, economic growth, equity and prosperity for 
all, fully understanding that the public and private sectors are 
both important players in the battle to secure a better life for 
the people. 
<H5>  Responsibility of Professionals </H5>
  A similar message goes to all the professionals of our 
country on whose hands falls the responsibility of ensuring 
that, in all fields, we become a country of excellence. Central 
to our success will be the contribution of all our educators. 
Inspired by the drive to banish ignorance and mediocrity, they 
must help the country to learn and learn again, regardless of 
whether one participates in adult education, the training of 
skilled workers or the preparation of specialists in pure 
science. 
  They must be in the forefront of a campaign to eliminate the 
scourge of illiteracy and to reestablish a culture of learning 
and teaching. 
<H5>  Lessons From the Past </H5>
  We would further like to address a special message to all 
those who see themselves as leaders or representatives of any of 
the racial and ethnic groups of our country. To them all we say 
if anything is to be learnt at all from the last three centuries 
of our country's history, it is that all our peoples belong 
together. All efforts in the past to separate and divide them, 
to present them as having interests that are mutually exclusive 
and to prescribe different destinies for them, has led to 
conflict and war and the crisis from which our country is now 
striving to extricate itself. 
  None who has the genuine interests of any of these sectors 
of 
our population can condemn them to that proven past of pain and 
misery, derived from the false and dangerous concept of separate 
development or unique ethnic interests. 
<H5>  Build One Nation </H5>
  We are greatly strengthened by the fact that, as part of the 
black oppressed, the coloured and Indian communities have 
rejected these notions and have therefore continued to stand on 
the side of freedom and a common nationhood. So also have many 
of our white compatriots come over to the vision of one 
non-racial South Africa, vindicating the positions of those 
whites who, however few in number, refused to be bribed into 
accepting white domination. 
  Let us therefore all join together to build our national 
unity, regardless of the colour of our skin, the language we 
speak at home and the religion we profess. Together we must do 
what our country and all its children cry out for -- to build 
one nation, inspired by a common patriotism and love for the 
rich diversity of cultures which is our common heritage. 
  We would also like to make this call to all political 
formations in our country, that whatever the differences among 
them, however vigorously they will contest the election ahead of 
us, they share a common responsibility to rise above the merely 
partisan and sectarian. Together we must do everything that is 
necessary to ensure that the April elections are free and fair. 
Together, we must act in a way that will produce the united, 
democratic, non- racial and non-sexist South Africa to which we 
all committed ourselves at the very beginning of the process of 
the multi-party negotiations. 
<H5>  Hope for the Future </H5>
  We must all remain true to the agreements we have reached. 
We, for our part, reiterate our firm commitment to honour the 
accords arrived at during the process of negotiations. 
  The whole democratic movement of our country, including the 
Patriotic Front and the tripartite alliance, has the 
responsibility to lead our country, no longer as a movement of 
resistance, but as the historic force for change on whose 
shoulders rests the hope of the majority of our people for 
peace, democracy and a better life. 
  The ANC itself must continue to improve its capacity to 
serve 
the people. This will mean organisation and yet more 
organisation to enable us to continue to mobilise and lead. We 
must ensure that we continue to maintain contact with the masses 
of the people and respond to their needs and aspirations. All 
our members, in the branches, regions and nationally must 
continue to be motivated by the motto -- we serve the people of 
South Africa! 
  We have, together, created the statutory organs that will 
take our country forward to its democratic future. These 
include the Transitional Executive Council, the Independent 
Electoral Commission, the Independent Media Commission and the 
Independent Broadcasting Authority. We extend our best wishes 
to all who serve on these important structures, pledge our 
support to them and commit ourselves to co-operate with them for 
the success of the common project. 
  We are confident that they will discharge their 
responsibilities in a fitting manner, conscious of the decisive 
consideration that theirs is not to serve a sectional or party 
interest but to create the conditions which will enable all our 
people to break out of their shackles. 
<H5>  We Pay Tribute </H5>
  As we approach our day of liberation, we extend special word 
of gratitude to the millions of people throughout the world, the 
anti- apartheid movement, other popular organisations, 
governments and inter-governmental organisations all of whom 
have been an important motive force in moving our country 
forward to the modern age. 
  As part of the continent of Africa, we pay special homage to 
the OAU and the frontline and neighbouring states whose peoples 
made such great sacrifices in support of our liberation 
struggle. The new South Africa will play its role in the 
struggle for the all- round development of our continent as an 
equal partner with all other countries and a force for peace and 
stability. Their work, like ours, is also not yet done. We 
appeal to them to continue to contribute what they can to ensure 
a smooth transition to a democratic order and the rebuilding of 
South Africa into a country which they will be proud to describe 
as a friend and a reliable partner. 
<H5>  Racism Has No Future </H5>
  Here, on these southern shores of the African continent, all 
humanity has the possibility to produce a result which will 
confirm that racism has no future, that the domination of one 
people by another has no place in the new world, that it is 
possible for a multi-cultural society to thrive in a situation 
of peace and harmony and that the peoples of our continent have 
as much a capacity as any other to achieve an all-round human 
success. 
  Our salute to the world community and the expression of our 
gratitude for what it has done to emancipate all our people, 
will be the victory we shall all score by the establishment of a 
united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South Africa. 
  It will be represented by our deeds as a democratic country 
when we act in solidarity with those who are oppressed and 
despised and play our role in the common effort to create a new 
world order of justice, peace, human rights and prosperity for 
all. 
<H5>  The People Shall Govern! </H5>
  We extend our best wishes to all our people and assure them 
that what continues to motivate us is neither personal gain not 
party interest. On our banners are inscribed the glorious words 
and the inviolate covenant -- the people shall govern! 
  Compatriots: Now is the time for this noble objective to be 
fulfilled. Now is the time that we make a decisive break with 
the past. Now is the time that we join forces as South Africans 
to make our country free at last. As this historic year begins, 
let all our thoughts and actions celebrate this as the year of 
liberation for all South Africans. 
  Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika! 
  God Bless Africa!

  [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has said that the 
government is determined to ensure that the measures announced 
earlier this month to control government expenditures and 
increase the level of tax collection are fully implemented. In 
talks with the British minister for overseas development, Lynda 
Chalker, held today at State House in Dar es Salaam, President 
Mwinyi said Tanzania wanted to assure the world that it was 
capable of taking essential measures in tax collection by means 
of firm steps and of controlling expenditure. 
  For her part, the British minister said she was encouraged 
by 
the measures taken by the government aimed at consolidating the 
country's economy, but said the results of these decisions were 
being awaited. She said the British Government wanted to extend 
technical assistance to Tanzania in the major sectors of customs 
duty and tax collection as an indication of cooperation, and to 
support measures which the government was determined to 
undertake. 
  Minister Chalker commended President Mwinyi and his 
leadership for peacefully undertaking steps towards a multiparty 
system. She said the international community was pleased with 
the successes of Tanzania in the political field, and that it 
was a good example, worthy of being emulated by other African 
states.

  [Text] Bujumbura, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Burundi authorities issued 
warrants for the arrest of 14 opposition leaders on Friday [7 
January], the day after demonstrations against the deployment of 
foreign troops left five dead, officials said. 
  Business activities resumed here, though the capital 
remained 
tense after thosands of young protesters, mainly students from 
the Tutsi ethnic majority, brought the city to a standstill by 
barring main roads on Thursday, while security forces stood by. 
  In one incident, five Tutsis were killed by a Hutu 
neighbourhood leader in the northwestern Bujumbura suburb of 
Cibitoke late Thursday, police said, but they gave no details. 
  Among those declared wanted Friday were the president of the 
Rally for Economic and Social Development (RADDES), Joseph 
Nzeyimana, several other leaders of that party, and the head of 
a seven-party opposition coalition, Salvator Nzigamasabo. 
  All 14 had left their homes and gone into hiding, informed 
sources said. Their arrests could lead to serious clashes, 
observers said. 
  The demonstrations were staged to protest against the 
arrival 
of some 200 peacekeepers from the Organization of African Unity 
(OAU), requested by the government following the October 21 
attempted military coup. 
  The aborted coup, during which Burundi's first ethnic Hutu 
president Melchior Ndadaye and several other government 
officials were killed, sparked tribal massacres that left an 
estimated 100,000 people dead. 
  The government accused the army and the police, who are 
mostly Tutsis, of "complicity" in Thursday's shutdown of the 
capital, which it feared could be related to a possible second 
coup attempt. 
  The protestors had originally planned to continue their 
demonstrations for three days, according to Employment Minister 
Leonard Nyangoma. 
  In another development Friday, three opposition parties 
chose 
a joint candidate for the presidency, Jean Ndeberi, an academic 
who teaches biology at the Burundi university and is president 
of the Burundo-African Alliance for Salvation (ABASA). 
  The late Ndadaye's party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi 
(FRODEBU), has put up Agricultural Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira 
as its candidate. 
  The government and the opposition have not yet reached 
agreement as to how the new president should be elected by 
parliament, a measure which would need a constitutional 
amendment. 
  Elections are not currently possible in Burundi, still at 
risk from ethnic massacres. Some 700,000 people have fled to 
neighbouring countries.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Head of State General Sani Abacha </F>
on the presentation of the 1994 budget in Abuja on 10 January -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Nigerians, there is in our country today a 
great yearning for a new direction. This yearning, which grows 
more urgent by the day, is both legitimate and understandable. 
After nearly three and a half decades of hopes raised and hopes 
dashed it should not be surprising that Nigerians are weary and 
worried. Having gone through several years in which their faith 
in the national enterprise has been abused and affronted, our 
people's impatience with the government and almost total 
distrust of its functionaries can no longer be dismissed as mere 
cynical. 
  At the birth of this nation 33 years ago, expectations were 
high and the possibilities for greatness were almost limitless. 
We appeared set for grand attainment to fulfill what the rest 
of the world saw as our manifest destiny to lead the black race 
into the mainstream of human civilization. But just as it 
seemed as if our sun was rising, twilight came and we have been 
groping ever since waiting for a new dawn. That we must 
recommence our journey to greatness is clear enough. What is 
not clear is the state of the vehicle with which to embark on 
that journey. Therefore, even as we yearn fervently for a 
speedy arrival at our destination, there is a need for us to 
pause and ponder as to the shape of the vehicle in which we sit 
to make our journey. Nigeria is today like a vehicle which has 
been reduced to a cannibalized contraption. It is a vehicle 
heavily buffeted by the elements and badly battered by its 
users. No one undertakes a journey with such a contraption. 
When confronted with such a situation, the sensible thing to do 
is to commence in earnest extensive repair works having 
established the causes and sources of the damage. This, in a 
nutshell, is the assignment with which this administration is 
now saddled. 
  Point of departure: In my maiden address to the nation on 
Thursday, 18 November 1993, I did touch on some of the factors 
that necessitated our positive intervention. In the course of 
this address I shall elaborate on those factors as a way of 
placing the specific measures adopted by the budget in proper 
context. Firstly, it must be obvious by now that our country 
has gone through one of the most difficult phases any nation has 
ever had to go through. On the economic front, enormous 
sacrifices were demanded from our people to undo the near total 
damage done to the national economy in the days of careless 
wastage. Nigerians readily made the required sacrifices only to 
find out that their gesture was not matched with expected 
results. All through the past decade or so the nation's 
economic foundations had been badly shaken and our cherished 
values almost totally subverted. In all these our people 
sought and found solace in the expectation that a new political 
order was in the making, which, when instituted would make the 
economic misfortune more bearable and the required sacrifices 
less harrowing. Our people gave all that it took to institute 
that new order, believing in the wisdom of the sage which said: 
Seek ye first the political kingdom and every other thing shall 
be added unto it. For eight years our people sought the 
political kingdom and conscientiously too. But just as the new 
political dispensation began to take shape, it suffers a 
horrendous blow. Months after that debacle our country is yet 
to recover from the impact of that rude shock which took the 
nation back to a point below zero level. 
  At the height of the crisis no aspect of society was spared 
and no public institution escaped its destructive fallout. Our 
country was drifting in a manner that not only threatened the 
ship of state, but indeed, also the entire foundation of our 
existence as a national entity. It was in the midst of this 
dangerous drift that we found it necessary to step in to check 
the incipient chaos and secure the integrity of Nigeria as an 
indissoluble federation. We did so like other key players of the 
political class who were involved in an elaborate game that 
became a riotous event. We make no pretensions about capability 
but, ironically, the military still remains the only institution 
in the position to put an end to the drift towards the yawning 
abyss of total collapse of the nation. Mission-minded, the 
foregoing constitute the historical context of current efforts 
[word indistinct] relevant and appropriate direction for 
Nigeria's socioeconomy. 
  Our policy direction for 1994 must therefore aim at the 
refashioning of the present ways of doing government business. 
A pointer to this need was given in my maiden address to the 
nation when I committed this administration to the necessity of 
reform of the major agencies and institutions of state. The 
problems which afflict our nation's institutions have brought 
them into disrepute and caused our people to be disenchanted 
with government. This administration has thus paneled a 
high-powered commission of inquiry into the affairs of those 
institutions that make or break government to demonstrate in 
concrete ways the need to set out our home in order before we 
begin to effectively use its resources for the enhancement of 
the quality of life of our people. 
  It must be stated that this administration is not, by the 
act 
of instituting reform panels, out to embark on vendetta. 
Rather, we believe that those reforms will form the basis for a 
renewed phase in our institutions and government. Let me 
emphasize that the reforms will be a continued exercise designed 
to ensure greater sensitivity of government to our people's 
desires, greater accountability, and transparency in government 
and, above all, greater responsiveness by government. 
  This administration places a very high premium on the 
genuine 
wishes of our people. This must be so because the immediate 
factor in our decision to intervene was the obvious drift in 
government occasioned by the estrangement of those in government 
from the governed. Previous administrations simply rejected and 
neglected to recognize the drift towards disintegration of our 
country due to their actions and inactions. Nigeria was close 
to disintegration at the time the military intervened on 17 
November 1993. It had become increasingly clear to us, and 
indeed to most Nigerians, that the best way out for us was to 
intervene to save the descent into anarchy. 
  This administration recognized at inception the 
undercurrents 
of the political crisis of our immediate past which was the 
reason for the decision to institute a constitutional conference 
to look into the multitude of problems which afflict us as a 
nation. The idea of an all-Nigeria constitutional conference is 
an idea whose time has come. This administration is committed 
to ensuring that the proposed conference meets the expectation 
of our people's collective yearnings for a more united Nigeria. 
  Furthermore, this administration has chosen through the 
proposed conference to play the vanguard role in channeling the 
energies of our people towards meaningful interaction in 
planning the course for the future of our country. We do not 
intend to abdicate this responsibility. Accordingly, the 
government has decided and will soon enpanel a constitution 
commission whose charge is to organize the proposed 
constitutional conference. The conference in time will make 
appropriate recommendations to the Provisional Ruling Council on 
an accepted political framework and program which will lead to 
the emergence of a democratic polity. 
  The apprehensions and reservations of a few of our 
countrymen 
and women about the proposed constitutional conference are fully 
recognized and appreciated. But these should not detract from 
the good intentions which form our original decision to convene 
the conference. Government will not abdicate its responsibility 
in providing the necessary and sufficient framework for a 
fruitful conference. Government wishes to appeal to all our 
people to be part of the genuine effort at fashioning a fair, 
just, and equitable basis of our collective existence. 
  Fellow Nigerians, having found ourselves in the situation of 
authority we have the responsibility to preserve our country 
from collapse and at the same time to visibly pursue the course 
of justice and fairness. It is also clear to us that this task 
before the nation is to pinpoint the problems as objectively as 
possible and to identify patriots who are prepared to sacrifice 
their time and leisure to honor a total call to duty and finally 
draw up a program of action. The general acceptance of the team 
we have assembled both in the Provisional Ruling Council and the 
Federal Executive Council strongly suggests that the action 
taken to ensure that Nigeria existed for us to deliberate on its 
future was based on sound judgment. 
  We are, however, not fooling ourselves into believing that 
because we have been joined by trusted eminent leaders from all 
sections and sectors of our nation, we have hereby solved the 
problems of the twin legacies of our inheritance, namely, a 
badly fractured polity and a dangerously weakened economy. We 
believe, however, that by ensuring a national administration 
composed of widely respected leaders charged with supervising 
our national search for a meeting ground, our intention to serve 
only as supervisors of this process remains genuine, 
nationalistic, and patriotic. We recognize that ours is a 
limited mandate. We also recognized that the process of 
reconstituting our polity and our economy must be undertaken by 
both the government and the governed. 
  The state of the economy: Fellow Nigerians, the economy 
which 
this administration inherited was once characterized by great 
disabilities and great instabilities. On virtually all the 
indices, the outlook was rather [words indistinct]. Economic 
output, (?which) was measured by gross national product, has 
been on a steady decline in the past few years. Owing to the 
sluggish growth, employment has stagnated, while the phenomenal 
growth in money supply, fuelled by expansionary fiscal policies 
have had pressure on the oil sector. Interbank and lending 
rates have risen to unprecedented levels, resulting in declines 
in investment and production. All these have been worsened by 
the collapse in the value of the naira, the attendant rapid 
increase of service charges on external debts, and the worsening 
of the balance of payments profile. In short, it can be said 
that inadequate fiscal discipline complicated the already high 
incidence of budget deficits, which in turn made efforts at 
economic reforms more difficult to handle and led to a worsening 
of social conditions. 
  Review of the 1993 budget: The federal budget of 1993 was 
formulated to address and redress the declining economic 
activities. One of its advertised objectives was to promote 
accountability and transparency in the management of public 
finance. The budget also aimed at enhancing public sector 
activities and social programs, while eliminating market 
distortions by giving freer reign to private enterprise. For 
reasons which are not too difficult to discern, the 1993 budget 
performed rather poorly, both in terms of attainment of set 
objectives and fidelity to the overall strategy. The budget 
deficit soared to 90 billion naira and this resulted in an 
excessive growth in money supply. The economy experienced high 
inflation, depreciation of the naira, and continued low capacity 
utilization in the (?real) sector. The political crisis which 
took up most of the second half of the year, only served to 
further accentuate these already serious problems. 
  The 1994-1996 rolling plan: The three year rolling plan was 
introduced to replace the five-year medium-term program as a 
development strategy. The two objectives of the 1994-1996 
rolling plan are to institute correct macroeconomics policies 
and instill fiscal discipline in order to fashion a more 
conducive environment for economic growth. It is this 
imperative that provided the context for the 1994 federal budget. 
  Goal of the 1994 budget: The goals of the 1994 budget have 
been set to reverse the negative trend of the recent past. These 
goals are: 
  1. A balanced budget firmly anchored on fiscal discipline 
and 
abolition of deficit financing. 
  2. Identification and mobilization of new sources of 
collective revenue. 
  3. Exchange rate stabilization and the reversal of the high 
incidence of capital flight. 
  4. Rationalization of interest rates to stem the decline of 
the rural sector. 
  5. Adoption of a comprehensive budgeting approach to bring 
all projects into the process. 
  6. Reduction in the level of subsidies and subventions to 
federal government-owned companies and parastatals, particularly 
those slated for partial or full commercialization and outright 
privatization. 
  7. Effective debt management strategies to reduce the debt 
service burden on domestic commitments and obtain debt relief 
from the external creditors. 
  8. Rehabilitation of social-economic infrastructure and 
strengthening of the law and order apparatus to provide a 
conducive environment for legitimate economic pursuits and 
private initiative. 
  9. Increase in the capacity utilization of the industrial 
sector and effective sourcing of local raw materials. 
  10. Promotion of growth linkages in the rural economy. 
  11. Promotion of employment opportunities to reduce the 
current high level of unemployment, especially among the youth. 
  12. Policy fidelity and close monitoring of implementation 
to 
ensure the attainment of these objectives. 
  These goals, singularly and in concert, define an economic 
framework for budget plans, and are, therefore, measures for 
ensuring overall discipline in our recovery effort. This 
administration will use these goals as a standard for measuring 
the performance of sectors, institutions, and officials. This 
administration wishes to serve notice that the monitoring and 
review of strategic institutions of public policy, which we have 
commenced, will continue to be intensified. This administration 
will neither tolerate the subversion of its programs and 
policies, nor will it allow its articulated goals and guidelines 
to be casually discarded or treated as mere suggestions. 
  Revenue projection: In the 1993 budget, revenue projections 
were premised on a continuing conservative outlook of oil price 
behavior. Unfortunately, the price of oil during the year fell 
below the projected level of $17.50 per barrel. This is why the 
1994 revenue projection from crude oil sales is based on the 
realistic price of $14 per barrel, calculated on an exchange 
rate of 22 naira to a dollar. This translates into an estimated 
revenue of 231.40 billion naira. Non-oil revenue is estimated 
at 47.1 billion naira. The Federal Government's retained 
revenue is estimated at 110.20 billion naira. 
  Expenditure estimates: The expenditure estimates for the 
1994 budget are largely influenced by the need to achieve the 
prime objective of a balanced budget. Therefore, government has 
adopted a budgetary approach which will commit all government 
expenditures to only available resources. Thus, the total 
expenditure outlay is estimated at 110.20 billion naira. 
  In addition to the traditional ministerial allocations, 
government will seek to provide funding for projects, will 
multiply effects on our economy such as: 
  1. High-yield seed development program for improvement in 
agriculture production. 
  2. Special incentives for small-scale industries involved a 
production of basic needs. 
  3. Funding for research and development efforts. 
  4. Activation of support for the export processing zone. 
  5. The liquefied natural gas and other gas and oil related 
projects. 
  6. Special assistance program for the educational sector. 
  7. Continuous support for the National Directorate of 
Employment. 
  8. Enhanced security program in the urban centers and on 
major highways. 
  9. Support for highway and city lightening program to meet 
the Federal Ministry of Works [as heard]. 
  10. Support for the mass transit program. 
  11. Rehabilitation of tertiary health institutions and 
medical research centers. 
  States and local governement finances: From the cautious 
approach adopted in the 1994 budget in regard to revenue from 
oil sales, it has become more necessary than ever, for state 
governments and local councils to further improve on their 
internal revenue generating efforts. Also given the acute 
concern for accountability and transparency which informed this 
budget, the Federal Government expects strict financial 
management at the other two levels of government and a visible 
pursuit of probity in the conduct of the activities. Local 
councils will continue to be funded directly from the federation 
account. In addition, they will continue to receive the 
mandatory 10 percent of state governments internally generated 
revenue. The state governments are required to make quarterly 
returns of all such transfers to the federal Ministry of Finance. 
  Foreign exchange rate: The achievement of the exchange rate 
stability, which is one of the foremost objective of this 
budget, requires the abolition of deficit financing, increasing 
aggregate supply of foreign exchange through intensified export 
promotion, encouragement of foreign investors, and the 
strengthening of measures to mobilize non-oil exports proceeds. 
While government remains committed to the policy of 
deregulation and to safeguard the integrity of the market 
forces, it is by now recognized that one of the fundamental 
factors which have further complicated the national economic 
crisis is the low exchange rate of the naira in relation to 
other currencies. Government is of the firm belief that the new 
economic direction of policy should be such as would create the 
right environment for the strengthing of the naira. 
  Government is aware that its due share of foreign exchange 
earnings by parastatals and government-owned companies, are not 
fully credited to it. Measures have therefore been put in place 
for effective tracking of foreign exchange earnings with a view 
to correcting existing anomalies. Consequently, government has 
decided that all foreign exchange earned by both private and 
public sector exporters of goods and services will henceforth be 
brought into the national foreign exchange account. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the concession formally granted to private 
exporters and parastatals to keep their foreign exchange 
earnings outside the central bank is hereby abolished. Also, in 
the light of our recent experience and in view of the need to 
create a favorable atmosphere for economic revival, government 
has decided that the exchange rate of the naira be fixed at 22 
naira to a dollar. Government will actively monitor this 
decision. Government expect that Nigerians will contribute 
towards ensuring the sanctity of this rate against all odds. 
  Other measures that have been adopted in order to strengthen 
the value of the naira include the following: 
  1. All imports are henceforth to be done on the basis of 
letter of credit, that is LC, supported by import duty reforms, 
IDR, and clear report of findings, CRF, except for imports that 
cost $1,000 or less. Imports of open accounts, including bills 
on collection, except on specific approval for the manufacturing 
and agricultural sector are abolished. All importers are to 
complete Form M. All imports of foreign exchange into Nigeria 
must henceforth be through the Central Bank of Nigeria, which 
shall guarantee free and unimpeded access to such forex for 
imports of goods and services. For the avoidance of doubt, any 
importer who has forex to use to import goods or services must 
first of all have to declare such to the Central Bank of 
Nigeria, complete the Form M, and establish the necessary letter 
of credit based on the use of funds earlier lodged with the 
Central Bank or designated banks. It would not be the basis for 
operating the LC nor could it be repatriated subsequently. 
  Bureaux de change are henceforth agents of the Central Bank. 
As such, they are to henceforth sell foreign exchange at the 
rate prescribed by Central Bank plus a fixed commission. 
Bureaux de change must therefore not sell forex to finance 
imports, nor should they sell more than 2,500 or equivalent to 
any one customer. Returns of transaction must be made to the 
Central Bank every month. 
  6. [Number as heard] All parastals, corporations, companies, 
voluntary organizations, and any agency whether foreign local, 
government or private which earn or bring foreign exchange into 
the country must report and lodge same with the Central Bank or 
Central Bank designated banks and spend such only in accordance 
with the prescribed guidelines but without any other impediment 
or question by the authorities. In other words, those who earn 
or bring in foreign exchange should be free to utilize it as 
they deem fit within the guidelines to be prescribed. The 
guideline should be gentle enough not to scare away prospective 
depositors . 
  7. All companies, agencies, and individuals, bringing forex 
into Nigeria must do so only through the Central Bank or 
approved banks. Such foreign exchange deposits could be 
withdrawn freely either in naira or foreign exchange with 
interest at the prescribed rate. Depending on the formula that 
the central bank could adopt for the sale of forex importers, 
the commercial and commercial ad merchant bank should only act 
as conduit for handling transactions on behalf of genuine 
clients. In this regard, appointed banks should only charge 
prescribed commission for their services. 
  9. [Number as heard] The minister of finance should bring to 
the Federal Executive Council proposals and ways to improve 
custom duty collection, including the possible use and 
inspection agents and the redefinition of the role of the Custom 
and Excise Department. 
  10. Henceforth high customs duty will be imposed on luxury 
goods and such goods should not be funded from official sources. 
A list of such items will be prepared by the Ministry of 
Finance and cleared with the Federal Military Government. In 
order to enhance their capacity, the Central Bank and the 
Department of Customs and Excise will be revamped and 
restructured to cope with the new challenges and added 
responsibilities in the foregoing decision and the overall 
efforts to revamp the national economy. This is to be without 
prejudice to the proposed reorganization of the customs duty 
collection system. 
  Finally, the Central Bank is to ensure strict supervision of 
the designated bank so that the abuses witnessed in recent years 
in the use of foreign exchange are eliminated and the erring 
banks appropriately sanctioned. To give efforts to the 
realization of all these economic measures an Economic 
Intelligence Committee will be established to monitor the strict 
implementation of all these policy measures. 
  Fiscal Policy Measures: Fellow Nigerians, the main thrust of 
fiscal policy in 1994 is the adoption of coherent measures that 
ensure expenditure discipline and revive revenue drive. To this 
end, the minister of finance has been directed to evolve 
workable measures for ensuring that all duties payable on 
imports are fully captured into government coffers. 
Concomitantly, a more vigorous effort will be made to curb 
smuggling and reduce the leakage of collectible revenues. The 
life of the present tariff regime is due to expire in 1994 and a 
committee has been set up to review the current tariff structure 
and come up with a comprehensive new structure in 1995. 
  Government has decided to introduce excise duties of some 
products this year. Details of these will be given by the 
honorable minister of finance in his budget breakdown. Suffice 
it to say here that all importers of goods must brace up for the 
payment of full duties as no new exemptions will be entertained 
outside of those already provided for by law. This measure will 
be applicable to all government agencies at all levels. Tax 
policy in 1994 will aim at encouraging genuine entrepreneurs 
while improving the enforcement of existing laws and the 
machinery for tax collection. However, a new tax on consumption 
known as value added tax, VAT, is to come into effect this year. 
States are to benefit from the yield of this new tax up to 80 
percent of total collection. Also, withholding tax on rents, 
interests, dividends, among others, has been raised from 5 
percent to 10 percent with effect from 1994. 
  Monetary and Credit Policy: Government has for some time 
been concerned about developing an appropriate macroeconomic 
package that will simultaneously address the issue of the low 
value of the national currency. The steep rise in interest 
rate, high commodity prices, and the ability of the productive 
sector to source credit and perform adequately. [sentence as 
heard] After due consideration of the report of the committee 
raised to examine these issues, government decided to firm up 
interest rate so as to save genuine economic activity. 
Consequently, the Central Bank has been given the charge to 
enforce strict compliance with the various existing regulations 
and to ensure that banks and other institutions found violating 
such rules are sanctioned appropriately. Specifically, 
government has decided to peg interest rates as follows: Savings 
and deposit rate is now fixed at between 12 and 15 percent; 
lending rate is fixed at 21 percent, inclusive of all charges. 
This means that 21 percent should represent the upper limit to 
be charged on any loan inclusive of legal and other charges. 
  Fellow Nigerians, the unseeming manner in which critical 
indices of our economic health has been grossly abused in the 
past few years call for decisive and drastic measures. With the 
existing interest rate regime, it has become clear that real 
producers were being penalized while peddlers of paper money, 
crafty manipulators, and idle speculators were milking the 
economy dry. No responsible government would fold its arms and 
watch such a negative trend continue unchecked. It is in our 
determination to do something positive that these new measures 
are being introduced and we sincerely hope that hard-working 
Nigerians who are the ultimate beneficiaries of a saner interest 
rate regime should rally around government in ensuring that 
these measures are not sabotaged. Additionally, in its efforts 
to ensure compliance with the new dispensation that the Central 
Bank is mandated to go beyond routine [words indistinct] where 
necessary and adopt active measures to bring transgressors to 
book. 
  With regards to structural allocation of credit, government 
has decided that in 1994 structural allocation of bank credits 
should give priority to agricultural and industrial production. 
Thus, the structural percentage distribution or commercial and 
merchant bank credit in 1994 shall be 60 percent of all credit 
to agricultural production and manufacturing enterprises, while 
non-oil exports and others would be allocated 40 percent. The 
ratio of rural lending to deposit, mobilize in the rural 
communities would remain at 50 percent in view of the pressing 
need to accelerate rural development. 
  Debt management: The management of the country's internal 
and 
external debt continues to present serious problems for 
macroeconomic policy and the attainment of growth objectives. 
In the attempt to reduce the level of debt stock, government 
has adopted policy measures that will lead to outright 
elimination of contracts not provided for in the budget. This 
would be in keeping with one of the cardinal points of this 
year's budget which is a vigorous curtailment of expenditure to 
ensure a balanced budget. 
  With regards to the serving of domestic loans, the federal 
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria have been 
charged with the assignment of designing a scheme which will 
result in reduction in annual debt service in real terms. 
  On the external loan front, government will continue to 
strive to reach an accommodation with Nigerian's creditors with 
a view to ensuring more favorable terms. It is our hope that 
the creditors will appreciate the particularly delicate phase 
through which Nigeria is now passing and exercise restraints in 
making impossible demands that can only serve to further worsen 
the tenuous economic and political situation of these times. 
  The social sector: From the broad outline given so far in 
this address, it should be obvious that the fiscal year of 1994 
will be an intensely demanding period in terms of budgetary 
discipline and adherence to enunciated goals and objectives. 
Government recognizes that the past few years have been 
especially harrowing for many Nigerians, particularly people in 
the low- and middle-income groups and those engaged in genuinely 
productive economic activities. It is government's intention 
and determination to bring some long overdue relief to our 
people in the area of public transportation, access to 
affordable and qualitative education, health services, provision 
of water and adequate food supply at reasonable prices. 
Government is of the firm belief that such relief measures can 
still be comfortably accommodated within the context of a 
balanced budget. What is required is the adoption of the right 
economies in the areas of checking public sector wastage, 
ensuring a shift away from the current practice of using scare 
public resources to subsidize the already affluent through 
lopsided pricing of services, enforcing a tax drive that will 
raise the revenue accrue into public coffers, glutting of sundry 
leakages in the official economy, and capturing of all economic 
activities into the formal sector. [sentence as heard] 
  We are under no illusion that this would be an easy task. 
Indeed, carrying them out successfully will require a blend of 
political will with which governments in Nigeria are not usually 
associated. Yet, we are acutely aware of the desperate 
situation in which we now find ourselves and have come to accept 
that there is really no alternative to keeping faith with our 
people than through sincerity and sufficient management of the 
economy to enable it carry out the needed social services. 
Consequently, 1994 will witness more vigorous activity on the 
part of government in the provision of improvement of social 
services, especially in the area of transportation and road 
maintenance, schools management, public health, and other 
related infrastructure. Our approach to the provision of social 
services is derived from the philosophy of social sector 
management which views those services not merely as items of 
public expenditure but more importantly as investment in a 
better organized society, and ultimately as imperatives for 
future progress given their enormous multiply effect. 
  Drug enforcement: Drug trafficking has become a monumental 
national embarrassment and a cancerous malaise which is a great 
source of concern for this administration. Nigeria is not a 
producer of drugs yet because of the indiscipline of some of our 
people, and their general tendency to get rich quick, have 
turned Nigeria into a notorious drug route. This attitude has 
an unhealthy effect on the image of this country. This 
administration therefore is determined to stamp out drug 
trafficking in all its ramifications. 
  Categorically, government has decided to revamp and 
reorganize the national Drug and Law Enforcement Agency to make 
it more responsive to its responsibility. It is pertinent to 
note that the recent seizure of drugs with a street value of 
over $300 million within our shores lend credence to this our 
renewed and vigorous efforts to fight the incidence of drug 
trafficking. We appeal to the international community to 
cooperate with us in this our current drive to stem the drug 
trade from our shores and plead for the exchange of information 
and technical assistance toward the attainment of this 
objective. Henceforth, government will deal ruthlessly with 
drug traffickers and their agents and will not tolerate the 
damage drug trafficking and other antisocial behaviors done to 
Nigeria's image. 
  Government is determined to ensure strictest obedience and 
the enforcement of stiffest penalties on offenders and assert no 
efforts will be spared to track down traffickers and their 
agents. 
  Youth and sports: Government is committed to constructive 
programs of youth development for nation building. In pursuit 
of this noble goal, the Ministry of Education and Youth 
Development as well as the National Sports Commission will 
continue to develop appropriate youth programs to prepare our 
young men and women for productive adult life. The future of 
any nation depends on a well-articulated and effective youth 
policy which can only be ignored at the nation's peril. This 
administration is highly impressed by the immense contribution 
of our youth in global competitions, particularly in the age 
group football competitions. The recent victory of our Golden 
Eaglets for the second time under 17th FIFA [Federation of 
International Football Associations] soccer competition in 
Japan, is an excellent example of the height which commitment 
and patriotism can propel us as a people. I enjoyed the Super 
Eagles who have qualified for the senior World Cup to emulate 
the excellent example of their kid brothers. 
  The government on its part will do everything to ensure a 
proper and result-oriented build-up to the prestigious global 
competition tagged USA 94. Government will do everything 
possible to make the requirements of FIFA to ensure Nigeria 
hosting of the under 20 youth soccer competition scheduled for 
next year. Apart from a domestic following which soccer enjoys 
in our country, hosting the competition will enable us to 
provide the world with strategic insight to our capabilities, 
potentialities, and the state of the development of the game of 
football in particular in Nigeria. 
  As we enter a year in which Nigeria will participate in many 
global sporting competitions, government enjoins all organs 
charged with the responsibility for sports development to show 
commitment and a sense of purpose in their preparation so that 
our flag can fly high to the glory of our beloved country. 
  The activities of those charge with the development of 
sports 
in the country, will henceforth be closely monitored. 
Government can no longer watch with indifference when those 
charged with the heavy burden of sports administration in the 
country, dissipate so much energy in endless bickering thereby 
making us the laughing stock in the international community. 
  The interphase of domestic policy and external demands: We 
are now more aware of the relationship between the various 
aspects of reform programs we have sought to implement and their 
overall effect on the quality of life of our citizens. We know 
that if we service debts, whose total legal character is yet to 
be ascertained, with our 30 kobo of every externally accrued 
naira and if the percentage devoted to servicing of our debts 
continued to increase while the total income continued to 
decrease, our people's welfare would also continue to be 
mortgaged. We know that if we embarked on economic reform 
projects that tie the hands of government and disable government 
from putting in place programs that will shelter the most 
vulnerable sector of our society from the negative effect of 
these reforms, we are actively increasing the ranks of 
disaffected who will demand other protection from these effects 
or call for a change of the economic order and of government. 
  We know that we cannot embark on a ruinous debt service 
regime, mount an economic reform program, and initiate difficult 
changes of our political system all at the same time. While 
investors' capitals seek new arenas opened by the ending of the 
cold war, it is apparent that the Nigerian managers of our 
economy would have to organize novel ways of undertaking reforms 
without increasing the volume of conflicts within our social 
order. The international community must also come to understand 
the implications of these various programs that have shaped the 
condition of life of our citizens. It is no longer enough to 
insist on reforms whose pattern of effect has now been 
catalogued country after country and yet for the international 
community not to appreciate what are the likely outcomes of 
changes that it advocates. 
  Nigeria, like other African countries similarly situated, 
have implemented structural adjustments of their economies. 
They are carrying the heavy burden that their debts place on 
their shoulders and they are saddled with the effect of a 
painful and conflict-ridden democratization of their policies. 
These three projects are all sources of conflict that threaten 
social order and peace. There must be a way of spacing them and 
managing the conflicts they generate. This administration 
believes that equal attention must now be devoted to the 
management of peace within our societies. Peace can no longer be 
assumed. New ways have to be devised for anticipating the 
conflict effects inherent in policy reforms. New complicities 
in approach have to be articulated. We know that in this task 
Nigeria must continue to contribute its leadership in assisting 
the international community in developing peaceful alternatives 
to the pursuit of political objectives through wars. As the 
curtain falls on the apartheid order of South Africa, a new day 
for African dawns, calling for the birth of a new leadership. 
This administration extends its invitation to the international 
community to join it in its exploration of the current condition 
of conflict situations that now limit our ability to march 
forward. 
  Reinvigorating the executive branch: The various measures 
outlined in this year's budget require renewed dedication on the 
part of those whose business it is to implement government 
policies. The existing structure of the executive branch cannot 
serve the inherited statescraft crisis without fundamental 
restructuring of legacies. The civil service which 
traditionally has served as the implementing arm of the 
executive branch has over the years lost momentum in part 
because of the negative impact of previous reform measures. 
Government views with concern the current decline in the output 
of the civil service and is determined to do something about it. 
Accordingly, government has decided to revisit the 1998 civil 
service reform with a view to reviewing its underlying premises, 
its execution, and implementation to date. 
  Significantly, however, there is a compelling and urgent 
need 
to enhance coordination as a management imperative in the 
executive branch of government. In the recent past, the size of 
the executive branch has grown so large as to be unwieldy. 
Quite a handful of agencies have found accommodation in the 
Presidency, whose scheduled responsibilities are duplications of 
what regular federal government ministerial departments do. In 
addition, the sheer size of the executive branch compounds the 
input processing problems and inevitably leads to the burdening 
of the chief executive by multiple actors, while the wearisome 
implication for undue centralization of power. [sentence as 
heard] 
  This administration cannot afford the pleasure, the luxury 
of 
operating the existing bureaucratic structures which under 
conditions more conducive and more supportive was only efficient 
in serving the personal interest of those entrusted with 
authority. Government is concerned that the present organization 
of work in the executive branch is administratively routine and 
results in much activity and traffic, but without the result of 
functional policy leadership. Government has therefore decided 
on the restructuring of the executive branch to make it 
functional in decisionmaking, decision execution, and decision 
monitoring. 
  Fellow Nigerians, in surveying the sad record of our recent 
past, it will be rather tempting to want to continually lament 
what has indeed been a tragic study in missed opportunities. It 
would be perfectly understandable if Nigerians now choose to 
engage in an unending recrimination over what went wrong, to 
point accusing fingers, or even to wallow in self-pity. Even 
before things went so bad, the apportioning of blame had become 
a growth industry in the society. Yet, even as we legitimately 
vent our anger and express our disappointment at the cavalier 
manner in which our lives have been mismanaged, we need to 
reconcile ourselves to the fact that life must go on. The past 
becomes an albatross only if we fail to learn from it and heed 
its lessons. It is now time to seek a sober understanding of 
what went wrong. We must now resume our search for unity and 
prosperity firmly anchored on peace and justice. We must 
collectively recommence the task of rebuilding our polity and 
restructuring our economy. 
  The 1994 budget has been articulated as a modest beginning 
in 
this direction. It has been said that the true test of a 
nation's progress is not how much it adds to the abundance of 
those who already have too much, but how well it is able to 
provide for those who have too little. The policies this 
administration wishes to pursue in 1994 are aimed at providing 
the right atmosphere for economic growth that goes hand in hand 
with social compassion. This cannot but be so, given the 
injuries of past years. Still, a lot will depend on all 
Nigerians to be patriotic enough to seek to work within the set 
guidelines and policies rather than seeking ever more 
imaginative ways of sabotaging the budget, to support a 
government in its effort to generate more revenue by ensuring 
prompt and correct tax declaration and bringing their 
income-earning activities into the official economy, to adhere 
strictly to business ethics instead of indulging in arbitrary 
increase in prices and lowering of the quality of their goods 
under the guise of the regulation, to refrain from acts that 
tend to smear the image of the country and which discourage the 
much-needed inflow of genuine foreign investment, to ensure high 
moral standard of discipline in the economic and other 
activities, to imbibe a better work culture, especially in 
rendering of public service, to rekindle faith in ourselves and 
our ability to create a Nigerian economic miracle, to remain 
continually vigilant in holding people in authority to set 
standards, especially with regards to accountability and 
transparency in government and, finally, to refrain from doing 
anything that will further complicate the already testy 
political situation so as to ensure the stability required for 
economic recovery. 
  All these are demands that underscore the need for 
discipline 
in the conduct of private and public affairs. On our part, we 
have committed government to initiate [word indistinct] see to 
restore orderly existence through the resuscitation of the war 
against indiscipline and corruption. We are determined to 
prosecute this war to the best of our ability. To this end, let 
me note that government had in the past decade invested 
massively in the infrastructure of public discipline. The 
appropriate agencies are hereby directed to speedily deploy what 
was committed to public discipline by preceding administrations 
for current purposes. The budget will attract criticism 
normally, but it is important to appreciate the commitment of 
this administration to brighten the prospect of our country, 
improve economic management, and create a stable and conducive 
political climate. 
  A lot needs to be done, but I have no doubt that together we 
can build a better future for our great country. Please accept 
in arrears my best wishes for a happy and prosperous new year. 
Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria! Thank you and God 
bless our country.

  [Text] Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare is among the 
African heads of state and prime ministers participating today 
in the extraordinary summit on the CFA franc. The summit is 
aimed at adopting a common position on the eventual devaluation 
of the CFA franc. The presence in Dakar of IMF Director General 
Michel Camdessus and French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin 
reinforces the idea that devaluation has become inevitable. 
Here is the position of Burkina Faso as given by President 
Blaise Compaore, who made a stopover yesterday at Bamako airport 
on his way to the Senegalese capital. He was answering 
questions from our special correspondents. 
  [Begin recording] [Compaore] As far as Burkina Faso is 
concerned, we intend to share our position with the other heads 
of state, for it is obvious that monetary manipulation may also 
be an economic measure. For our states, we will always have to 
raise the same issues of debt, the purchasing power of workers 
--the hardworking masses of our countries -- and certainly the 
solidarity mechanisms which will shore up our union after such a 
measure. This means that with the other heads of state we will 
come up with a common position on the issue. 
  I think there is concern in all our countries. We do not 
have a final position. This depends on the advantages we might 
obtain from this measure and also on what international 
organizations and France, our main partner, will tell us. 
  [Reporter] Is the fight against devaluation lost in advance? 
Can the franc zone countries put up solid arguments to the 
proponents of devaluation? 
  [Compaore] I think the problem is not at that level. What 
advantages do we have today with regard to the current economic 
situation? There is economic stagnation in all our countries. 
There is no investment and there is flight of the little capital 
that remains. We have a rather unpleasant situation. This 
means that what we are seeking today is not either devaluation 
or no devaluation. I think we have gone beyond this stage. Our 
concern today is whether devaluation will improve our economic 
situation. 
  In the event of devaluation, what are the relief measures to 
be taken? What will be the internal measures and what measures 
can we expect from the financial institutions and from our main 
partner, France, and the international community in order to 
improve our economies? The debate is not exactly whether we 
should devalue or not, but if we have to devalue today in the 
interests of our economies, what are the relief measures that we 
have to take with our partners so that this devaluation will not 
be a disaster for our economies? 
  [Reporter] It must be noted that 10 out of the 14 heads of 
state in the franc zone will take part in the Dakar summit. 
Cote d'Ivoire, Congo, and Togo will be represented by their 
prime ministers, while Cameroon will be represented by its 
finance minister. The extraordinary summit on the CFA franc has 
overshadowed somehow the second major subject to be discussed in 
Dakar -- the situation of Air Afrique. The company is in very 
poor shape and the heads of state need to adopt a rehabilitation 
plan. They will also decide on the admission of Guinea Bissau as 
the 12th member and on the renewal of the term of office of Air 
Afrique's managing director, Yves Roland Billecart. [end

  [Excerpt] Dakar, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Eleven African leaders on 
Monday [10 January] adopted a plan to salvage the beleaguered 
Air Afrique company with an injection of 18 billion CFA francs 
(61 million dollars) at a meeting here. 
  At the summit convened in the Senegalese capital because of 
a 
financial crisis facing the multi-national airline, its French 
director Yves Rolland-Billecart a new five-year mandate. 
Niger's former prime minister Amadou Cheiffou had been mooted 
to replace Rolland-Billecart, whom some African governments had 
accused of failing in his management of the airline. 
  The 11 heads of state and government gathered here called 
for 
a "financial audit" of the company. 
  Rolland-Billecart said his new plan provides for a profit of 
300 million CFA francs (almost one million dollars) in 1994, 
turning round a deficit of four billion CFA francs (13.6 million 
dollars) in 1993. "There will be economies across the board, 
but no cuts in staff," he declared. 
  Share-holders of Air Afrique are Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, 
the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire], Mali, 
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad and Togo. 
  The last recovery plan Rolland-Billecart introduced in 1989 
led to the loss of 1,750 jobs among 5,000. The new 
recapitalisation plan has been made necessary by the refusal in 
December of the African Development Bank to contribute to a 
raising of the company's capital, obliging each member state to 
pay 500 million CFA francs (1.7 million dollars). 
  France has agreed to help out countries unable to do so. 
  At the meeting here, Guinea-Bissau became the 12th member of 
Air Afrique. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dakar, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Leaders from 14 African 
nations agreed in principle here late Monday to the devaluation 
of their common currency, the CFA franc, but reached no formal 
accord, authoritative sources reported. They said heads of 
state and government had endorsed the idea of a 50 percent 
devaluation of the CFA franc, a largely West African currency 
pegged to the French franc. But in return they called for 
stronger compensatory measures than were being proposed by 
either the International Monetary Fund or France, as one western 
source said many of the countries were unprepared for such a 
devaluation. 
  After meeting for six hours behind closed doors, sources 
said 
the discussions broke off at 10:30 P.M. (2230 GMT) and would 
resume early Tuesday. 
  The devaluation rate will be the same for all of the 14 
countries in the Franc Zone, with specific financial measures 
applied to each country to offset the consequences, the sources 
said. Among the main measures called for are loans to help 
cushion the effect on imports, especially basic goods, which are 
expected to flood the market after devaluation. In addition 
delegates here urged the suppression or reduction in each of the 
14 countries' debts, in particular with France, their main donor 
country. In addition, they are reported to have called for an 
unspecified amount of financial aid for businesses to offset 
higher salaries that will become necessary by a fall in 
individual buying power. 
  As the meeting broke up late Monday, there were no details 
of 
any specific figures, but aid to businesses would also help 
reduce debts and refill each country's coffers. But one donor 
told AFP many of the 14 nations were unprepared for the effects 
of such a devaluation. "The spectre of devaluation, which has 
lain dormant since last August, has arrived without African 
leaders really believing it would happen and before they were 
able to take the necessary measures to accompany it," he said. 
And other Western sources said only the Ivory Coast [Cote 
d'Ivoire], which had already declared itself in favour of a 
devaluation, had come to the meeting well-prepared, armed with 
facts and figures. The other countries were forced to outbid 
their neighbors in a scramble for increased financial 
compensation. 
  The current parity between the French franc and the CFA unit 
has not been changed since 1948. One French franc is worth 50 
CFA francs, or currently about 294 CFA francs to the US dollar. 
  Monday's agreement in principle has come after pressure from 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has insisted on a 
devaluation in return for help with structural adjustment 
programmes. 
  The move would increase the price of imports, on which CFA 
franc countries are largely dependent, and open the way for more 
exports. Of 14 Franc Zone members, the only one likely to reap 
immediate benefit from devaluation is major coffee and cocoa 
exporter Ivory Coast, experts said. While devaluation would 
favour exports, regional leaders have argued that African goods 
face weak demand on international markets, thereby nullifying 
any likely gain from the initiative. 
  Attending the summit are heads of state or government from 
Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, 
Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, 
Niger, Senegal, and Togo and the Comoros. They were joined 
Monday after three hours of talks, by IMF Director General 
Michel Camdessus and French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, 
as well as the finance ministers from the 14 participating 
countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba by </F>
Africa No. 1 reporters Christian Dounou de Louamiy and Jean 
Valere Mbinamanza; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Oye-Mba] A survey has shown that Gabon does not 
expect to gain from a devaluation of the CFA franc because the 
purpose of a devaluation is to increase the competitiveness of 
an economy. It implies that prices of the country's products -- 
agricultural and industrial products which are exported and 
services -- will decrease, thus enabling one to sell more 
abroad. However, in Gabon's case, the country depends mainly on 
oil, timber, manganese, and uranium today. The devaluation of 
the CFA franc would not enable us to sell more oil or timber. 
The price of oil has decreased because there is a current glut 
in the international markets. There is overproduction of oil 
and OPEC's major debate is, precisely, on trying to regulate 
production to prevent oversupply. Therefore, based on the 
analysis of the structure of our country's economy, I can affirm 
that Gabon does not expect to gain from the devaluation of the 
CFA franc. 
  Now coming back to your question, the problem of price 
control is effectively a central one in the manipulation of 
exchange rates. There is a great risk of inflation. Why? 
Because the consequence of the devaluation of a currency is 
that all imported products automatically become more expensive 
in proportion to the devaluation, of course. It also means that 
human beings being what they are, each of us individually and, 
collectively -- groups, societies, nations -- each one will 
leave no stones unturned to restore the predevaluation situation 
in order to gain, as it were, what it would have been lost in 
the devaluation. All these phenomena create a spiralling price 
increase that must be controlled. If it is not controlled, the 
possible benefits of the devaluation will be annulled. The 
success or failure of any decision to manipulate the exchange 
rate in a country hinges on this price control. 
  [De Louamiy] I will go deeper into the question, Mr. Prime 
Minister. In a context of devaluation, the state, of course, 
finds itself in a situation where it has less income because 
exports remain at about the same level for certain countries 
like Gabon and are no longer able to fetch as much money as 
before. At the same time, the prices of imported goods remain 
at the same level. Since the state no longer has the full 
capacity to subsidize the prices of essential commodities, will 
we not end up in a situation where the purchasing power of 
citizens will be decreased? 
  [Oye-Mba] Of course. Effectively, the risk of a devaluation 
is that the purchasing power of the people decreases because the 
value of the currency they use in acquiring goods reduces after 
devaluation. Besides, the state no longer has the same 
possibility to subsidize the prices of goods both for equipment 
or consumption. It is more difficult to do so, therefore, 
effectively, the consequence is the risk of decreased purchasing 
power which it is appropriate for one to examine. It is a 
question of making the right decisions for things to continue to 
move on even better than before the devaluation. I would say it 
is a whole alchemy; it is an art, it is an art. 
  [Mbinamanza] Has the Gabonese Government thought about these 
compensatory measures? 
  [Oye-Mba] Well, I am telling you that in the meantime, we 
consider that there should be no devaluation. There should not 
be any devaluation because Gabon will not benefit from any 
devaluation. Nevertheless, we are aware that our country is in 
an extremely difficult economic and financial situation. I have 
never hidden this from the Gabonese. We intend to pursue the 
policy that we have started, that of controlling the [words 
indistinct] of our country, notably the [word indistinct] of the 
state in the strict sense of the word. [end recording]

  [Text] Dakar 11 Jan (AFP) -- The summit of 14 African 
states on the CFA franc, which was suspended last night, resumed 
in Dakar today at 1030 in order to find a common stand on the 
eventual devaluation of the franc. The deliberations are still 
going on behind closed doors. According to sources close to the 
participants, the principle of devaluation was accepted 
yesterday by the time the meeting was suspended but no agreement 
was reached on the relief measures requested by the African 
countries.

has decided to join the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. 
Brigadier Oupa Gqozo of Ciskei told a meeting of chiefs and 
headmen in Bisho that state officials were informed that they 
would experience problems if they did not cooperate with the TEC 
and that the National Party and the ANC [African National 
Congress] had left him no choice. Ciskei, which has been 
gradually moving away from its partners in the Freedom Alliance, 
said last month that it would participate in the 27 April 
election.

<F P=106> [Press statement by Gertrude Mzizi, IFP Transval Peace Desk, </F>
issued by the office of the Chief Minister of KwaZulu on 10 
Janaury on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] deplores the 
shooting of SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
journalist Abdul Shariff during an ANC [African National 
Congress] visit to Katlehong yesterday. We are conducting an 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident 
and our leadership in the area has fully cooperated with police 
enquiries. 
  As a preliminary comment, however, we note the following: 
  1. Tokhoza and Katlehong have been decimated by recent 
inter-ANC fighting, and all ANC attempts to resolve this have 
failed to date. This was the motivation behind Sunday's visit. 
Yet instead of calling the ANC's warring parties to a neutral 
venue, the ANC chose to go on a unannounced walk-about in the 
most highly contested part of the township. 
  2. Hostel residents are adamant that the first shots were 
fired at them from ANC-occupied houses alongside the hostel as 
the ANC entourage neared the hostel. 
  3. The ANC had not negotiated the visit with hostel 
residents 
-- subject to constant ANC harassment and attack -- whose first 
knowledge of what was happening was when a group of ANC 
supporters started approaching the hostel. 
  4. We find it incomprehensible that in the midst of a war 
zone, an armed ANC entourage was moving about in the vicinity of 
the hostel. Those armed included ANC leader Robert McBride, as 
well as SDU [self-defense unit] members and other ANC operatives 
who were openly flaunting their AK-47s. In the light of recent 
events in Tokhoza, there was nothing to indicate that their 
intentions were anything but hostile. 
  5. The four people arrested by the police are neither IFP 
supporters nor hostel residents. There is a very strong 
indication that in addition to shots fired at the hostel, shots 
were also fired at the ANC entourage by renegade ANC elements 
that have already claimed so many ANC lives in the area. 
  In short, we believe the ANC acted in a highly irresponsible 
manner and that the tragedy would never have occurred had the 
ANC planned its visit properly.

Police [SAP] into kwaZulu without the formal co-operation of, 
and consultation with the kwaZulu Police will be regarded as an 
invasion, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
warned on Tuesday. The decision was made at a kwaZulu cabinet 
meeting, a statement by Mr Buthelezi said. "The kwaZulu 
government will therefore not hold itself responsible for the 
consequences which may ensue should such an invasion take place 
in areas under the jurisdiction of the kwaZulu police. And nor 
will the kwaZulu government be held accountable for anything 
that takes place outside formal arrangements and co-operation 
with the kwaZulu government," said the statement. 
  Mr Buthelezi said both police forces could operate in each 
other's jurisdiction only after consultation.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 10 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[AVF, Afrikaner National Front] has suspended negotiations with 
the African National Congress [ANC] following a televised 
statement by ANC leader Nelson Mandela that Afrikaners should 
not expect self-determination in a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner state] 
before the April 27 election. The establishment of a Afrikaner 
homeland was inevitable and the Afrikaner nation would now use 
other methods to gain its freedom within an own state, AVF 
chairman and Conservative Party leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg said 
in a statement on Monday. 
  The statement did not elaborate on the methods. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said said Mr Mandela's standpoint made on 
SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV on Sunday was 
verified at a meeting on Monday afternoon between him and the 
ANC president. 
  "Mr Mandela's viewpoint was that the Afrikaner should indeed 
be accommodated, but that the concept of a volkstaat would have 
to be discussed by all ANC structures, which was practically 
impossible before April 27." 
  The AVF said Mr Mandela had undertaken to react to the AVF's 
demands after proper consultation with members of his 
organisation.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  ANC Contradictory on Police Presence -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR 
in English on 11 January in a page 12 editorial mentions the 
hostels, and the lack of police presence in Katlehong, as "two 
distinct aspects" of the events that led to the killing of a 
journalist in a shootout during a visit to the area by Joe Slovo 
and Cyril Ramaphosa on 9 January. A "veritable arsenal" was 
found in the hostel at the center of this attack, and in this 
respect the police "appear to have failed the community. They 
should deal with problem hostels more effectively." But the 
African National Congress, ANC, "is not beyond reproach either. 
It did not ask for protection on Sunday, probably because of 
its well-known hostility towards the Internal Stability Unit, 
the only SAP [South African Police] presence in the area. Yet 
it now complains about the absence of the SAP. Mr Mandela went 
so far as to say that it was not relevant whether the ANC had or 
hadn't asked for protection. We beg to differ. If the ANC 
doesn't want the police around, it should not go marching into 
well-known trouble spots unprotected." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Criticism of ANC Reaction to Katlehong Shooting -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 January in a page 4 
editorial says the potential victims of the shooting in 
Katlehong on 9 January, were Cyril Ramaphosa and Joe Slovo, and 
their "violent deaths would again have taken South Africa to the 
brink of disaster, and perhaps beyond. That, and the fact that 
photographer Abdul Shariff was killed and two other journalists 
injured, has shaken the renewed confidence that has developed 
since the signing of the constitution in November. Even more 
disturbing is that gun battles of this sort are almost daily 
events in that part of the East Rand, and in parts of Natal." 
BUSINESS DAY believes the ANC's reaction to the shooting "did 
little to support its argument that it is ready to govern. It 
instinctively sought a scapegoat and, as usual, the police were 
the obvious and easiest choice. Why, after all, should they not 
be everywhere all the time, even if their presence is often 
described by the ANC as provocative rather than helpful?" 
BUSINESS DAY further wonders how the ANC would address the 
problem of violence. "Will it take harsh and ultimately 
ineffective security action against the `enemy' -- such as the 
Inkatha-supporting hostel dwellers -- while leaving alone the 
gangsters acting in the name of the ANC among the self-defence 
units? The threatening parallels with National Party rule are 
not encouraging." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Katlehong `No-Go Zone' for Media -- "The death of 
photographer Abdul Shariff at the hands of faceless killers in 
Katlehong on Sunday is a stark reminder of the frontline role 
media workers have assumed at this stage," notes a page 6 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 January. It 
seems to SOWETAN that "there is an attempt to create no-go zones 
for the media in these areas, apparently so that the mayhem in 
the hapless communities of the East Rand, will continue without 
the prying eyes of the media. Media workers must not allow that 
to happen." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  Call for ANC To Control Self-Defense Units -- Johannesburg 
CITY PRESS in English on 9 January in a page 14 editorial finds 
it "galling" that those responsible for the latest round of 
killings in Katlehong and Thokoza are members of the 
self-defense units, SDU's, "structures which were created for 
the specific purpose of curbing violence in the townships." "No 
one can deny that some SDU members are involved in violence. 
But if the police were doing their job efficiently, and some of 
them were not colluding in the violence as several respectable 
organisations have alleged, there would be no need for SDUs." 
"For too long the ANC has been shirking its responsibilities 
instead of clamping down on the culprits by subscribing to the 
fiction that the SDUs were not their creation. With uncertainty 
looming ahead, disbanding the SDUs once a national peace-keeping 
force has been established may not be a solution. What is needed 
is for senior ANC members to take control of them so that its 
actions are monitored." 
<H6>  ILANGA </H6>
  SADTU, Cosas Promises -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu for 10-12 
January in a page 4 editorial notes: "The promises by the 
teachers' union, the South African Democratic Teachers Union, 
SADTU, and the student organization, the Congress of South 
African Students, Cosas, to make this year a trouble-free one 
for the education process must be commended and supported by 
everyone who favors progress in the education field. We trust 
that this means that right from the beginning of the year school 
pupils can go back to being just exactly that, school pupils. 
We trust also that they will now desist from playing principal 
and taking on themselves the task of registering pupils and 
hiring and firing teachers." "We repeat, that this is a good 
thing, indeed, that is being promised by these student and 
teacher organizations, but we need to know the details of just 
what they are promising." "We also say that you parents should 
stand up for your rights as parents to see to it that your 
children do not become pawns in the games of the ruthless right 
under your noses. Let us as a nation take these promises 
seriously and make sure that they are fulfilled."
