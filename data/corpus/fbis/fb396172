  [Text] The government and the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] continue to discuss the formation 
of the national police in Lusaka, Zambia. It is so far the only 
point under discussion and it seems as if it will continue to be 
discussed for some time. UNITA is presently examining the 
organic composition of the national police so that it can then 
present its views. Reporter Joao Ligio reports. 
  The Lusaka II peace talks resumed today with only a meeting 
of an ad hoc commission established to carry out plenary 
sessions without disruption. The face-to-face meeting which took 
place today did not last long. The meeting began at 1000 and 
two hours later it had already ended with another request for a 
break. 
  The session began with the government giving detailed 
information on the national police law, as requested by UNITA. 
UNITA then immediately asked for another break to study the law. 
Since there was no time limit for studying the law, the next 
session will depend on the speed with which UNITA studies the 
law, which it says was approved by a parliament in which it did 
not take part. 
  This is another step backward by the Black Cockerel's men, 
who are trying to gain time, since so far, they have not reached 
a common negotiating stand within their ranks. It has also been 
learned that UNITA negotiators received serious warnings, 
because of UNITA's intransigence, during a meeting they held 
with U.S. Congressmen yesterday at Victoria Falls, 473 km from 
Lusaka, along the border with Zimbabwe.

  [Text] While one waits for peace from Lusaka, in Angola the 
war continues. Over the weekend, National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] rebels strengthened their 
positions in the outlaying areas of the city of Cuito, Bie 
Province. Local sources say UNITA reinforcements have come from 
Soyo. UNITA plans to mount a large-scale attack on the city of 
Bie. 
  Savimbi's men have attacked the town of Limbombos in Bengo 
Province, and Quijenje and Ukuma in Huambo Province. UNITA's 
heavy artillery fire caused a substantial number of dead and 
wounded among civilians.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura has said 
that 1994 is a decisive year for this country's international 
relations. To begin with, the Foreign Affairs Ministry will 
seek to increase even further its diplomatic work in Africa and 
other parts of the world and indications are that there are good 
prospects for success. 
  [Begin Moura recording] Within that context, many meetings 
are planned for Africa and other parts of the world. It is 
worth noting that the OAU has some scheduled meetings, beginning 
with one in February. There are also some planned visits by 
foreign affairs ministers expected to visit us this year. We 
have the summit of the heads of state of the Lusophone African, 
PALOP, countries, preceded by a meeting of PALOP foreign 
ministers. We have a meeting of our ambassadors, at which I am 
sure we will be discussing issues pertaining to management, 
competence, and the commitment of all to their diplomatic 
duties, which they must discharge in an increasingly responsible 
manner. The peace process must be defended, as must be the 
interests and the property of the Angolan State. Abroad, we 
must seek to project a dignified image of Angola. All those will 
be issues to be discussed at that meeting, which is scheduled to 
take place this year. We believe that this year is decisive for 
us to show greater commitment on all fronts and a greater 
dedication to the national cause so that peace can become our 
principal objective as early as possible this year. [end 
recording] 
  The People's Television of Angolan also asked Foreign 
Minister Venancio de Moura to comment on a problem that has 
prompted a protest by the Angolan Embassy in Lisbon. The 
Angolan foreign minister noted that there is the need for great 
understanding for the benefit of relations between the two 
countries. 
  [Begin Moura recording] It is not the first time that this 
happens. We have been receiving reports and we have been using 
the most appropriate channels to urge the Portuguese authorities 
to behave in a manner compatible with this kind of situation, 
considering that we share historic and privileged relations and 
that there are norms to be followed in relations between two 
sovereign states, notably with regard to reciprocity and mutual 
advantages. 
  We have tried to attend to Portuguese citizens whose 
presence 
in Angola is often irregular, so we would not like our 
compatriots and, in particular, Angolan citizens who are senior 
government officials and their families to be expelled or 
humiliated because of the poor understanding -- I think it has 
to do with poor understanding -- and sometimes even the 
subjective approach of some functionaries in the Portuguese 
Immigration and Border Services Department. Those people enjoy 
immunities and privileges. Our consulate has also made some 
contacts in a bid to request greater understanding on the part 
of the Portuguese authorities and to ask for measures to be 
taken to prevent similar situations arising again. Should our 
requests not be heeded, obviously we shall have to start 
considering the implementation of one of the principles listed 
in the Geneva Convention and which have to do with reciprocity.

  [Text] Angola's ambassador to Namibia says rightwing 
extremists in South Africa are sending mercenaries and aid to 
the rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] group. Garcia Bires says there is solid evidence to 
prove that South African rightwing groups are sending equipment 
to UNITA, via Zaire. Bires says white mercenaries, believed to 
be from South Africa, are fighting alongside UNITA in northeast 
Angola. He refused to name the extremist groups involved in 
aiding UNITA, but says it's a coordinated effort among the 
rightwing groups. The ambassador's claims come as UNITA and the 
Angolan Government are pursuing negotiations in the Zambian 
capital Lusaka to end their civil war.

  [Text] Dakar, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Leaders from 14 African 
nations resumed talks here Tuesday afternoon on the issue of the 
value of the CFA franc, in the wake of an indication by 
authoritative sources that they had agreed in principle on a 
devaluation. 
  The participants took a lunch break on Tuesday, but then 
reconvened at 1500 GMT in a closed-door session -- which was not 
attended by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Michel Roussin, French 
cooperation minister. The two men had met separately Tuesday 
morning with the African leaders. 
  The authoritative sources had reported that the 
participating 
countries had agreed in principle late Monday to a devaluation 
of their common currency, the CFA franc, but had reached no 
formal accord. They said the participants had endorsed the idea 
of a 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, a largely West 
African currency pegged to the French franc. 
  Authoritative sources said later that the continuation of 
the 
Dakar summit meeting was to be explained by the difficulty of 
reaching agreement between the participating countries and aid 
donors on measures that should accompany a devaluation. 
  They said that a uniform rate of devaluation would be 
adopted 
for the 14 countries in the Franc Zone, on the order of 50 
percent, but the funds for providing compensation would be 
shared out depending on each country's specific needs. The 
total amount might be on the order of two billion dollars, one 
Western source said in Dakar. 
  In another development, French businessman Pierre Castel, 
chairman of Castel Freres, which supplies most of 
French-speaking Africa with beer, protested strongly against a 
possible CFA franc devaluation -- which he said would have 
"dramatic" consequences both for Africa and for his group. 
  He said "A 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc would 
force us to hike the price of our beer by around 40 percent. 
And if African salaries don't go up, we will lose half of our 
sales, and have to make layoffs".

  [Excerpt] We open this newscast with the announcement of 
the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50 percent. The decision to 
devalue the CFA francs was reached at 2010 GMT, a devaluation of 
50 percent which means that henceforth 1 French franc is equal 
to 100 CFA francs with effect from 12 January which is less than 
two hours from now. It should be noted that the 
anti-devaluation front members, that is, those against 
devaluation, fell with their arms in hand because they had 
fought hard to gain the maximum out of the backup measures. 
This front, represented by President Abdou Diouf, fought hard 
for nearly 48 hours to get the maximum concessions. 
  From the beginning people were talking of 75, then 100 
percent of devaluation. But we arrived at 50 percent. Here is 
Cameroonian Finance Minister Antoine Ntsimi, who read the 
official communique of heads of state and delegations of the 
franc zone. 
  [Begin Ntsimi recording] By this measure, which should 
contribute significantly to the competitiveness of member 
states' economies and create conditions for the rapid 
restoration of major domestic and external balances, the West 
African Monetary Union [UMOA] and the Bank of Central African 
States [BEAC] authorities aim at improving the living conditions 
of our people; establishing a suitable climate for a sustained 
and lasting growth; resolving the unemployment problem which is 
currently hitting the most active force of our population; 
reviving exports and returning of capital placed in foreign 
banks; and the encouraging domestic savings. The implementation 
of this new strategy of adjustment of our economies will benefit 
from the financial support of the Bretton Woods institutions and 
all countries that are our partners in development, especially 
France. [end recording] 
  On his part, France also undertook to support members of the 
franc zone by a series of backup measures such as the 
cancellation of public debts for the poorest countries and 
alleviating the debts for others. France will also help set up 
a special fund for development for African countries. French 
Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin made this pledge on behalf 
of the French Government: 
  [Begin Roussin recording] Therefore, France will support 
efforts aimed at any adjustment embarked upon. The French 
Government will propose to its parliament immediate unilateral 
measures to alleviate the debt of each country of the zone. For 
the poorest countries, all the debt through development aid 
still outstanding to France will be cancelled. The decision to 
write off arrears owed to the French Development Fund will 
enable the fund to resume its assistance in each of the franc 
zone countries. France will contribute significantly to the 
opening [words indistinct] funding of its partners, members of 
the franc zone, within the context of a program which will be 
concluded with the International Monetary Fund. [end recording]

  [Text] Dakar, 11 Jan (AFP) -- The CFA franc was devalued by 
50 percent, it was announced this evening in Dakar by the 14 
member countries of the franc zone. 
  The devaluation allows for a series of backup measures which 
were not immediately published. The decision was published 
after an extraordinary summit was carried out behind closed 
doors yesterday and today including representatives of 14 member 
countries of the franc zone (10 heads of state, three prime 
ministers, and a minister of finance from 14 African countries).

  [Excerpts] The interim chairman of the Burundi Democratic 
Front [FRODEBU] ruling party, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, and 
who is also chairman of the National Assembly, held a press 
conference yesterday. Mr. Ntibantunganya first presented the 
FRODEBU's candidate to the presidency of the republic. 
FRODEBU's candidate is Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira, current Burundi 
minister of agriculture. He is an old companion of late 
President Melchior Ndadaye. 
  According to an amendment to the constitution, which the 
National Assembly has analyzed upon request by the government, 
which in its turn has to ratify it, the unique candidate would 
be presented to the parliament to be elected. Today the 
National Assembly was due to elect him, but the proceedings 
could not take place because the government has not yet ratified 
the amendment. [passage omitted] In fact, Article 182 of the 
same constitution says that no amendment of the constitution can 
be undertaken when the nation is facing serious internal 
troubles. 
  The opposition parties yesterday held a press conference to 
denounce this. They have even presented candidates to the 
presidential election stated by the law when the head of the 
state and the chairman of the National Assembly can no longer do 
their job. Two candidates already known are Dr. Jean Ndeberi 
from the Abasa [Burundi-African Alliance for Salvation] party 
and Mr. Joseph Nzeyimana from the RADDES [Rally for Democracy 
and Economic and Social Development] party.

  [Excerpts] Diplomatic offensives are being carried out to 
remove the country from the deadlock over the creation of the 
broadbased transitional institutions. Talks have been held 
between all parties involved on all fronts but the deadlock 
remains. This is because President Juvenal Habyarimana, author 
of the artificial deadlock, has proved to be inflexible and 
wants to desperately maintain his dictatorial power. [passage 
omitted] 
  Everyone is growing tired of the irresponsible behavior of 
President Juvenal Habyarimana who does not want to respect the 
Arusha agreements. [passage omitted] 
  The ongoing struggle for democracy must be continued be it 
-- 
against our will -- through the use of weapons. In this regard, 
let us listen to a commentary by [words indistinct]: 
  [Unidentified reporter] [passage omitted] Should President 
Habyarimana toughen his position by constantly violating the 
Arusha agreements which he signed himself with his own hand, 
there is no alternative other than that of resuming the armed 
struggle. It is the only way, as experience has shown, for the 
(?dictatorship) to listen to the voice of reason, albeit 
momentarily. 
  Things must be clarified here. President Habyarimana agreed 
with change mainly because the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
combatants' armed strength compelled him to do so. Even at the 
present hour, if President Habyarimana continues to drag his 
feet on the agreements which he solemnly signed before the 
Rwandan people and the international community, the freedom 
fighters will again take up arms as this seems to be the only 
language capable of persuading Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development [MRND] supporters to see reason. 
[passage omitted] 
  The worst is to be feared should the current situation of 
insecurity organized by MRND supporters last. The worst is to 
be dreaded given the quantity of weapons distributed among the 
people and given the stubbornness of President Habyarimana who 
has deliberately and openly torpedoed the peace process. 
[passage omitted] 
  Facing this feeling of inevitability of war which the 
president of the Republic is trying to spread throughout the 
country, everybody must acknowledge that peace remains the most 
valuable thing since it is the only thing which can truly be 
profitable to Rwandans. It is therefore important that 
everybody works toward the restoration of that peace and the 
creation f the broadbased transitional institutions.

  [Excerpt] The situation in our country is becoming more and 
more worrying. In Kigali [words indistinct] today, Ambassador 
Andre Katabarwa, a former minister and ambassador and former 
managing director of the Public Electricity, Water and Gas 
Production, Transport and Distribution Company in Rwanda was the 
victim of a grenade attack. The grenade was thrown by attackers 
disguised as mechanics repairing a motorbike near Mr. Andre 
Katabarwa's home. 
  The would-be assassins waited for Mr. Andre Katabarwa to go 
past them at 1215 to commit the atrocity. Mr. Andre Katabarwa 
was hit in the fingers, thighs, and ribs. His watchman, who 
opened the gate of the compound, was also wounded. The car was 
heavily damaged. 
  Mr. Katabarwa, who was taken to hospital, received treatment 
and returned home as his injuries were not judged serious. 
Witnesses interviewed said that [word indistinct] gendarmes 
were patrolling in a vehicle near Mr. Katabarwa's home while the 
attackers were pretending to repair their motorbike. The 
gendarmes' vehicle disappeared immediately after the attack 
against Mr. Katabarwa. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The head of state's ultimatum to the Zairian 
political class involved in the negotiation process expires 
tomorrow at midnight. In response to this message, the 
Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] and the coalition of 
forces of democratic change -- commonly known as the Allied 
Forces of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [FAUSOR] -- 
met at the People's Palace for the signing of the protocol 
agreement. The ceremony was to have taken place this afternoon 
at 1600, but it was not until later this evening that the two 
parties met at the Banquet Hall and the document has just been 
signed. Tumba Matulu, you have just arrived straight from the 
People's Palace. Tell us how things went there. 
  [Matulu] It must be stated, Kabamba Kasongo, that things 
went 
on smoothly. At 1850, Messrs. Nguz A Karl-I-Bond of the FPC and 
(Simba-Wudu Ngwake Duntube) of the FAUSOR signed the protocol 
agreement. This document was also initialed by all the 
negotiators who were at the People's Palace for the ceremony 
which is still going on at the moment. As you know, the first 
consequence of the signing of this protocol agreement is the 
formation of a national reconciliation government. As was 
stated by the head of state, the new government to be formed 
will function in line with the spirit and letter of the People's 
Palace accords, particularly the special arrangement on the fair 
and balanced sharing of power.... 
  [Kasongo, interrupting] Tumba Matulu, without interrupting 
you, you are talking of allies who have just signed the protocol 
agreement. Now, what has become of Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition [USOR]? 
  [Matulu] I stress that it was (Simba-Wudu) who signed on 
behalf of the FAUSOR. You know we are in a democracy. There 
were the FPC and the USOR and Allied Forces. And, while the 
USOR did not turn up at the People's Palace the allies on the 
other hand were there. You will understand that we are in 
democracy. At any rate, since all the reports were also signed 
by the two main political groups, it was the majority that 
emerged, in spite of USOR's absence this evening. In other 
words, this protocol agreement which was laboriously negotiated 
by members of the FPC and those of USOR and Allied Forces will 
be binding virtually everyone. [passage omitted] 
  [Kasongo] Apart from the people who normally turned up for 
the negotiations, were there some foreign personalities in the 
hall today? 
  [Matulu] I would say no. At any rate, this is how things 
will go: As it was stipulated in the protocol agreement that 
foreign witnesses -- e.g. the OAU, the UN, Belgium, France, and 
the United States, the chairman of the High Council of the 
Republic [HCR], and the president of the Republic as he 
announced himself -- these personalities will be present at the 
second stage. So you understand that a solemn ceremony will now 
have to be organized -- this is (?a purely) protocol matter -- 
for the head of state to also sign the document. [passage 
omitted]. 
  [Kasongo] Tumba Matulu, a last question, perhaps. Going by 
the president's speech, the idea was that the future prime 
minister come from the ranks of the opposition. Now, you have 
just said the opposition was absent. I am referring here to 
USOR. So does this now mean that the head of government will 
come from USOR's allies? 
  [Matulu] Well, the allies are not in power. They belong to 
the opposition. The allies belong to the opposition. It is 
good you were with me at the People's Palace. The allies did 
not sit on the same side as the FPC. They, indeed, posed a 
great deal of problems to the FPC negotiators. Therefore, they 
belong to the opposition. They are people fighting against the 
government of the day and, to arrive at elections, it was said 
that we needed to play down our differences and go through this 
transition together, after which we will together take... 
[pauses]. The president of the Republic wished that the prime 
minister come from the opposition. The allies belong to the 
opposition, and they too have a lot of qualified people. If 
they agree and put up a highly competent person to the head of 
state... [pauses]. First of all, what are the criteria. A 
candidate to the post of prime minister must be someone who 
brings people together. In other words, he should be a person 
on whom there is consensus. Let us assume, for instance, that 
this very evening the allies appoint a candidate accepted by the 
FPC, you will understand that the head of state will have no 
option but to endorse this appointment in line with the spirit 
of these accords, and such a man will belong to the opposition. 
  [Kasongo] And, Tumba Matulu, what do you say is the next 
stage? 
  [Matulu] At the next stage, as I said, this protocol 
agreement will have to be signed by the head of state. The HCR 
chairman also has to sign it, because that is what the protocol 
agreement says. That will be the second stage. So it is a 
purely protocol matter and those responsible for organizing it 
may provide further information on the matter shortly.

  [Text] There is another imminent shortage of bank notes. 
The alert was given by an economic magazine, LE STANDARD. In 
an article in today's issue, written by its editor and director, 
Gaston Mutamba, the newspaper reported that the reservation of 
bank notes has started again in certain cases. 
  The banks can no longer offer any liquidity at their 
counters. Our colleague also stressed that people are no longer 
making cash savings because, according to him, businessmen have 
hurriedly reconstituted their cash stocks. Also, the 
skyrocketing inflation and speculation force them to take 
precautions by getting rid of the national currency for the 
benefit of foreign exchange. This is a serious situation, 
Gaston Mutamba revealed. He observed that the Central Bank is 
no longer in a position to print new bank notes because it owes 
foreign printers about $50 million. 
  It can also be read in LE STANDARD that the Central Bank 
could remedy the situation by printing bank notes locally after 
importing the necessary materials, but the problem will remain 
wholly unsolved. Our colleague asked where the necessary 
dollars would be obtained since the country has not got 
sufficient foreign exchange. An imminent shortage of bank notes 
is therefore feared in the official channels of the economy, the 
LE STANDARD official said. For him, this shortage could have 
occurred earlier if the two Kasais had accepted to do 
transactions with the new currency.

  [Text] The Cuban foreign minister, Mr. Roberto Robaina, 
left Accra today for Lusaka, Zambia, at the end of a two-day 
visit to Ghana to continue an African tour. 
  Mr. Robaina, who is leading an eight-member government 
delegation, told newsmen that the international community is 
ignorant about the difficulties the United States blockade of 
Cuba has imposed on the people during the past 35 years. That 
is why the government has launched a worldwide diplomatic 
offensive to let the world know the truth about the embargo. He 
said the blockade has denied Cuba her rightful place on the 
international market because it has virtually been impossible to 
open the country up for foreign investment. 
  Mr. Robaina said in the face of all these atrocities, Cubans 
believe that they have been able to survive the worst of tests. 
He said no other form of pressure, apart from respect for the 
dignity of Cubans can resolve the island's impasse with the 
United States. 
  The foreign minister repeated that Cuba is ready for 
dialogue. However, she will negotiate under one condition only, 
and that is mutual respect for each other's dignity and 
sovereignty. He added that his visit to Africa will afford him 
the opportunity to update his knowledge about the region and 
consolidate the bonds of friendship and cooperation between Cuba 
and Africa. Mr. Robaina will also visit Namibia, Angola, and 
Zimbabwe.

  [Text] The New Patriotic Party [NPP] has appealed to the 
government to keep the strictest vigilance on refugees and 
exiles currently within the country's borders to ensure that 
they do not violate Ghana's hospitality to the detriment of her 
relationship with other countries in the West African subregion. 
  In a statement signed by the secretary general, Mr. J. 
Agyenim Boateng, the NPP expressed concern at the ever-worsening 
relations between Ghana and Togo. It said the Aflao-Lome border 
bombing incident is only one of the lingering and mutually 
suspicious lines of hostilities that have characterized the 
relations between the two sides since the 1960's. The party 
therefore urged the government to take immediate steps to arrest 
this unfortunate trend and restore peace, normalcy, mutual 
respect, and trust between Ghana and Togo.

finance, Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu, while signing the budget breakdown 
in Abuja. He said that the exportation of yam, maize, rice, and 
cassava are prohibited. The minister also said that the

  [Text] In line with the federal government's directive, the 
Nigeria Airways has taken delivery of its Boeing 707 cargo 
plane. The plane was seized in Kent, England, over a 
controversial debt. The aircraft flew into the country in the 
early hours of Thursday [6 January] last week. The return of 
the high-revenue yielding aircraft followed successful 
negotiation by the Nigeria Airways management led by its 
managing director, Mr. Andrew Agom. 
  This brings to three the number of seized Nigeria Airways 
aircraft that have been released by creditors. Mr. Agom said 
the authority is doing everything possible to carry out 
reorganizations as directed by the government. For this reason, 
letters have been sent to those who will replace returning 
overseas stations staff. He also said a new flight schedule will 
be out by the 17th of this month with the emphasis on the west 
coast routes.

  [Excerpts] Nigeria cannot remain unconcerned with recent 
events that took place in Togo. This is what Nigerian Foreign 
Minister Babagana Kingibe told reporters after meeting with 
President Eyadema at his private residence at Lome II. Let us 
listen to the minister talking to Kakou Kegebe: 
  [Begin Kingibe recording in English, fading into French] The 
events of the 5th of January here have come as a great shock to 
my head of state, General Sani Abacha, who is a great friend of 
General Eyadema and who holds the general and Togo in the 
highest esteem. And when he learned of the renewed attempt on 
the life of the president of Togo, he asked me to come over. 
[passage omitted] 
  What pleased us most is that we found him as the same person 
who has always kept his calm and who displayed his readiness to 
always maintain good relations between Togo and its neighbors. 
This has greatly encouraged us, and we are going to undertake 
the same contact with our friends in Ghana so that whatever 
understanding there might be, it could be settled peacefully 
among brothers since we are are all members of the same 
subregion. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces for

possibility of South African mercenaries being present in its 
ranks. The sources described as false and completely unfounded 
the claim made by the new Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola [MPLA] ambassador to Namibia regarding South African 
extreme right-wing elements. The sources said the claim is an 
MPLA ploy aimed at diverting attention from the mercenaries the 
Futungo de Belas government has been recruiting through the 
(Executive Altcom) company. We have been informed that 
mercenaries recruited by the MPLA in Namibia and South Africa 
are in Cabo Ledo.

  They trained at Cabo Ledo, some 70 km from Luanda. They

defending the country: 
  [Begin Pedale recording] The National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] does not want democracy. In view 
of that, I believe that it is highly necessary to strengthen the

  [Text] Defense Minister Pedro Maria Tonha Pedale says Jonas 
Savimbi was primarily responsible for the instability and 
socioeconomic unrest Angola experienced in 1993. Speaking at 
the closing session of yet another course for commandos of the 
Angolan Armed Forces, the defense minister accused the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] of wanting to 
Balkanize the country. 
  [Begin Pedale recording] In view of its thirst for power and 
ambition, UNITA has launched a number of military operations 
greatly affecting our people as a whole. With its warmongering 
actions, UNITA has killed thousands of Angolans. Such actions 
prevent the free movement of people and goods, leading to 
famine, misery, and malnutrition of Angolans. UNITA's dream is 
to Balkanize Angola. Likewise, UNITA's actions prevent the 
government from implementing its program to raise the standard 
of living of Angolans and to establish democratic institutions. 
[end recording] 
  The defense minister said UNITA is opposed to democracy. All 
it wants is to subjugate the people by the force of arms. 
  [Begin Pedale recording] Another aspect of UNITA's 
activities 
is its irresponsible handling of the peace talks with the 
government. As we all know, UNITA is not interested in true 
peace for Angola. UNITA only wants to seize power by force of 
arms and then establish a dictatorship, because UNITA is aware 
that Angolans have rejected its rule at the ballot box. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Marcos Garcia Mbanza, 
commander 
of the Moxico Military Region, yesterday said UNITA is moving 
troops and military equipment to attack positions of the 
government armed forces and the residents. Lt. Gen. Mbanza 
reminded Jonas Savimbi's warmongering movement that Luena is and 
will always be a UNITA graveyard should the Black Cockerel's 
forces dare to attack that city. Right now UNITA's activities 
consist of abducting civilians, mining main roads, and stealing 
civilian property.

<F P=106> [Report from the STAR Africa Service] </F>
  [Text] Lusaka -- President Frederick Chiluba yesterday axed 
a Minister and a deputy Minister in a Cabinet shuffle that 
appears to fall short of the demands by donor nations for 
decisive action to wipe out corruption in his government. 
  Chiluba fired Health Minister Boniface Kawimbe and Dean 
Mung'omba, Deputy Minister in the National Commission for 
Development Planning, but gave a reason far removed from 
allegations of corruption. He accused Kawimbe and MUng'omba of 
"irresponsible indiscretion" in holding a news conference on 
their return from the Paris Club meeting last month before 
briefing him on the outcome of the meeting. 
  At that meeting, western donors demanded stronger measures 
than the tougher anti-corruption legislation proposed by 
Chiluba's government. They are reported to have demanded the 
removal of Ministers engaged in drug trafficking and other 
corruption. 
  Announcing the Cabinet shuffle at a news conference, Chiluba 
said his Cabinet was clean and he saw no reason to fire more 
ministers. He denied suppressing corruption probe reports and 
produced a report exonerating all but one Minister. The report 
recommended the prosecution of the new Health Minister, Michael 
Sata, who was found to have failed to declare an interest in a 
financial deal involving his ministry.

  [Text] The MMD [Movement for Multiparty Democracy] national 
chairman, Elias Chipimo, today refuted reports that he will soon 
quit his party post. In an interview with ZNBC [Zambia National 
Broadcasting Corporation] in Lusaka, Mr. Chipimo said that he is 
not yet ready to quit his party post. He said that reports 
(?which) have quoted him as saying that he will soon quit his 
post are false [words indistinct] to the conference, said he has 
never said anything about quitting his party post and that 
reports attributed to him were misinterpretations of his 
intentions.

Congress] from using its territory as a base for attacks on 
South Africa. [passage omitted] Political observers in Dar es 
Salaam say Tanzania has now effectively ended all association 
with the PAC which, together with its armed wing, APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army], has its headquarters in the east 
African country. 
  Meanwhile, the PAC in Johannesburg has reacted with surprise 
to Tanzania's decision. PAC Deputy President Johnson Mlambo 
also denied that his organization has used the east African 
country as a base for attacks. He says that the PAC has always 
had good relations with Dar es Salaam and those relations remain 
sound. 
  PAC spokesman Maxwell Nemadzivhanani says APLA has already 
taken a stand not to make statements from Tanzania: 
  [Begin Nemadzivhanani recording] The APLA leadership has 
already informed the leadership of the PAC that they will desist 
from making statements from any neighboring country because 
every time they do so, South Africa gets an opportunity to put 
pressure on the Frontline States. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 12 SAPA -- South Africa's transition to 
a democracy is the most important development in southern 
Africa, Japan's vice-minister for foreign affairs, Shozo Azuma, 
said in Pretoria on Wednesday. Speaking after meeting Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, Mr Azuma said Japan regarded 
southern Africa as the most promising African region. 
  South Africa was a key state and it was therefore important 
that the April 27 elections be a success, he said, and all 
parties should participate. "In that respect Japan wishes to do 
whatever it can to help so that can happen," Mr Azuma said. 
  Mr Botha said he was looking forward to a further 
improvement 
in relations with Japan. 
  Mr Azuma will also meet senior African National Congress 
officials and representatives of the United Nations and other 
international organisations during his visit to discuss roles to 
be played by the international community in the elections. His 
tour of southern African countries is the first follow-up step 
to be taken after the Tokyo international conference on African 
development last year.

<F P=106> [From the Channel Africa report] </F>
  [Text] South African State President F.W. de Klerk has 
welcomed an increased foreign presence in the country for the 
elections due to be held in just more than three months' time. 
Mr. de Klerk was speaking in Pretoria after meeting with 
visiting Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring. 
  [Begin De Klerk recording] It's great to be good friends 
again with Ireland. We, during our discussion, focused firstly 
on the process in South Africa, on the prospects of a free and 
fair election, the problem of violence -- what is being done 
about it, what can be done; on the negotiation process which has 
not been completed. As you know, some significant parties are 
not on board and we're trying to get them on board. Our meeting 
with Mr. Nelson Mandela will also focus on the state of 
negotiations. We also focused on the European Union's 
relationship to a new South Africa, the role it could play in 
ensuring that this first chapter of the new South Africa will be 
a very successful one; focused on how we could expand and the 
necessity for expansion of bilateral relationships in the sphere 
of trade and industry. I welcome the establishment of a 
cooperative organization between the private sector of Ireland 
and the private sector of South Africa. We welcome the 
establishment of full diplomatic relations. 
  By and large, may I say that we hope that also this visit 
will contribute towards good cooperation between us in South 
Africa, those in charge of the election -- the Independent 
Electoral Commission, the government and other parties, and the 
teams of international observers that we expect here to be 
vastly expanded as we come nearer to the election. We welcome 
the international observation which will take place. It is 
important that international community should satisfy 
themselves, and it is also important that their presence can 
make a contribution to ensure that there won't be intimidation 
because that poses the biggest threat to the coming elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner National Front leader, General </F>
Constand Viljoen, by reporter Estelle Pienaar on the "PM News 
Wrap" program; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] General Constand Viljoen says the ANC [African 
National Congress] and the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF -- 
Afrikaner National Front] have reached the end of the road of 
negotiations. Talks between the ANC and the AVF have broken 
down over the establishment of an Afrikaner volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland]. Leader of the AVF, General Constand Viljoen: 
  [Begin recording] [Viljoen] It is a disappointment. There is 
some inconsistency in the whole development. We had, on 
Saturday morning, rather very positive discussions with the 
negotiating team and then all of a sudden, Saturday afternoon 
Mr. Mandela took a very strong viewpoint and he repeated it 
Sunday evening and to us it is now very clear that Mr. Mandela 
has decided completely otherwise [as heard]. As I say this is 
rather, you know ... [changes thought] It is not in line with 
the discussions and the spirit of the discussions which we had 
up to now, so it is a great disappointment, yet the two leaders 
met yesterday afternoon and they have sorted it out and it 
appeared as if Mr. Mandela has decided that there will be 
absolutely no position on a volkstaat -- then I agree with Dr. 
Hartzenberg. Then there is no sense in carrying on with the 
negotiations at the moment. 
  [Pienaar] Have you had any feedback from the negotiators on 
the ANC's side and from your negotiating team so far? 
  [Viljoen] Of course, we met here with our own negotiating 
team. We have discussed the situation, not with the complete 
team but we have consulted with the individual members up to 
now. I haven't called them together. The ANC today will 
probably meet their negotiating team and we will probably hear 
from them in due course -- what their viewpoint is, but from the 
negotiating teams there is not much we can do because it was 
decided at leadership level there will be no negotiations and I 
can see no alternative, because what is the sense of carrying on 
with negotiations. Are we just wasting our time? This is the 
pity, you know, even Mr. Mandela's present action is 
inconsistent with his previous ones, because previously he has 
said to us -- don't shout at us, give us a map. Now this is the 
time when we were really moving towards what he demanded and 
then all of a sudden he called it off just like that. So to us 
this is not quite understandable. 
  [Pienaar] How do you see the road ahead? Is there still a 
light at the end of the tunnel? Do you still see the 
possibility of an agreement being reached before the deadline? 
  [Viljoen] This is a very serious situation that we have 
arrived at, at the moment, because humanly speaking we have come 
to the end of the road of negotiations. Now, what have we 
achieved? I think from the Volksfront's point of view what we 
can say is we have achieved at least the higher moral ground -- 
to say that ... [changes thought] or the moral high ground to 
say we have done everything that we possibly could. We have 
really gone all the way. We have done this with enthusiasm and 
we haven't spared a moment. We even worked between Christmas and 
New Year to facilitate this so that is what we have achieved. 
Now the road ahead of us: I would say we have to decide now 
what else to do because there is no doubt about the fact that 
the Afrikaner wants a volkstaat and that we are going to have a 
volkstaat. I have been very firm on this right from the 
beginning and we were prepared to negotiate the details of the 
volkstaat, but we were never prepared to negotiate anything but 
a volkstaat and this is for a security arrangement -- for a 
peace arrangement for the future of South Africa. I think it is 
in the interest of the whole country, and what is even more 
important is the fact that this is a possible peace settlement 
or a complete change of attitude between two major forces of 
South Africa -- the Afrikaners and the Africans, as represented 
by the ANC. It is rather a disappointment because we both ... 
[changes thought] both negotiating teams always acknowledged 
this fact of how important this is. [end recording]

think that it's ridiculous to suggest that right wingers on the 
whole are involved because we are not the people with the 
AK-47s; we are not the people that are assassinating the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] leadership, that are involved in 
shootouts in the townships. I mean, it is ridiculous to suggest

  [Text] Durban Jan 11 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi's rejection of South African 
Police [SAP] deployment in KwaZulu was a threat to peace in that 
territory, Natal African National Congress [(ANC] leaders said 
on Tuesday. "What he is saying is a serious threat to peace. The 
reason people are calling for the SAP in our areas is to try to 
bring peace and stability there," said northern Natal ANC 
Secretary Senzo Mchunu. 
  The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] decided last month 
to request the SAP to immediately provide security to residents 
in four northern Natal areas where KwaZulu Police [KZP] had 
apparently been unable to quell violance. 
  But Mr Buthelezi said in a statement on Tuesday that such a 
move, taken without the formal cooperation of, and in 
consultation with the KZP, would be regarded as an invasion. 
"The KwaZulu government will therefore not hold itself 
responsible for the consequences which may ensue should such an 
invasion take place in areas under the jurisdiction of the KZP. 
  "And nor will the KwaZulu government be held accountable for 
anything that takes place outside formal arrangements and 
co-operation with the KwaZulu government," said Mr Buthelezi in 
a statement. 
  In reaction, ANC southern Natal chairman Jeff Radebe said: 
"It is a declaration of war. He (Mr Buthelezi) knows that, even 
legally speaking, he is standing on shaky ground. "By law, the 
SAP is entitled to police anywhere in South Africa, including in 
self- governing territories." 
  Mr Radebe's response followed a report submitted to the TEC 
by the SAP in Natal which stated that in terms of the 
Self-Governing Territories Constitution Act (No 21 of 1971) a 
legislative assembly had no power to make laws concerning SAP 
presence in KwaZulu. The SAP report provided clarity on its 
right to police KwaZulu where there have been constant claims of 
KZP bias and hit squads. 
  Commenting on Mr Buthelezi's statement, Midlands ANC 
chairman 
Harry Gwala said no one, particularly the Zulu people, wanted 
confrontation. The KZP had no hope of succeeding in resisting 
SAP policing in KwaZulu, he said. 
  Mr Buthelezi's statements came as the Transitional Executive 
Council was scheduled to discuss SAP deployment in KwaZulu. 
  Mr Radebe and Mr Mchunu claimed the IFP president's 
statements "prove beyond doubt he is against stability and 
peace. We call on the TEC to ignore his statements".

  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has 
defended its decision that no further policemen should be 
deployed in KwaZulu, saying the situation there had improved 
somewhat. The chairman of yesterday's sitting, Dr. Dawie de 
Villiers, said there had been a slight decrease in violence 
since the TEC had given orders last month for the police to 
bring the situation there under control. He said that the 
situation was not yet satisfactory, and that it would be 
monitored continually. KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi warned earlier that the deployment of more police in 
kwaZulu would be seen as an invasion. 
  On the controversy surrounding the government's campaign to 
promote the new constitution, the council decided that it would 
control the campaign in future. The South African 
Communications Service will continue promoting the constitution 
in the media, but it will now do so in consultation and 
collaboration with the TEC.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 11 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] was solely responsible for the tragic shootings 
in Katlehong on the East Rand on Sunday in which a press 
photographer was killed and two journalists were injured, 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Transvaal leader Themba Khoza said 
in Johannesburg on Tuesday. 
  He said the ANC was prepared to risk lives for political 
mileage. The ANC had not organised the visit properly. It 
should have alerted peace monitors, the IFP or the police of the 
visit to protect its officials and the media, Mr Khoza said. 
"If the IFP had known of the visit we would gladly have worked 
with the ANC to protect its safety. I personally would have 
stood as a barrier between the ANC delegation and hostel 
dwellers," Mr Khoza said at a press conference. 
  "Mazibuko hostel has a strong Inkatha population and it is a 
fact that if outsiders enter no-go areas, there could be 
trouble." Hostel dwellers, who had not been told of the visit, 
might have felt threatened by the many heavily-armed ANC men 
marching towards the hostel. "They could have thought they were 
under attack," he said. 
  It was not important who fired the first shot because the 
"civil war" in Katlehong had been going on for several years. 
But the man who shot and killed photographer Abdul Shariff 
should be brought to justice, he said. 
  The IFP would do everything it could to help police in their 
investigations. "I do not believe the press are being targeted 
by any group. Mr Shariff was unfortunately caught in the 
cross-fire between warring parties," Mr Khoza said. 
  "Police need to continue raids on the hostels and residents' 
homes to confiscate weapons. It is a very difficult task but 
people must be disarmed. Guns mean violence."

Council's office of the media director: "Reaction to the ANC's 
attack on the National Party comment following the Katlehong 
shooting incident"; statement issued in Afrikaans] 
  [Text] The harsh and personal attack on the National Party 
by the ANC [African National Congress] is just another 
transparent attempt by the ANC to shift all responsibility and 
blame for its part in violence, concerning the chaotic situation 
of the Self-Defense Units on the East Rand. The attack on the 
National Party was launched to disguise the dilemma currently 
facing the ANC. This dilemma concerns the fact that the ANC, 
campaigning for the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Unit of 
the South African Police [SAP], now suddenly criticizes the SAP 
for its absence during the shooting incident. The dilemma and 
embarrassment of the ANC is worsened because their leaders are 
not repudiated when they instigate their supporters to turn 
their rifles and bullets on the SAP. To criticize the National 
Party in order to disguise one's own shame is scandalous and 
laughable. The ANC's double-talk is already absolute proof that 
the electorate will not trust their vote and their future to a 
party characterized by a culture of double-talk.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 10 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] on 
Monday welcomed Brig Oupa Gqozo's announcement that Ciskei would 
take part in the April 27 election and hailed it as a courageous 
move towards democracy in that part of South Africa. The Ciskei 
homeland, a member of the right-wing Freedom Alliance, said 
earlier on Monday it would join the Transitional Executive 
Council (TEC) helping to chart South Africa's transition to 
majority rule. 
  Brig Gqozo also announced that 250 Ciskei troops would serve 
alongside government soldiers and former guerrillas in a 
national peacekeeping force. 
  In a statement issued in Pretoria the NP said brig gqozo's 
vision to avoid a cul-de-sac for his own people and his 
breakaway from an unhealthy partnership of groups who had very 
little in common was a wise move. "It is also the first visible 
crack in the Freedom Alliance and will set the pace for others 
to follow. We sincerely hope and trust that other individual 
groups within the alliance will also display their commitment to 
a democratic solution by following suit. 
  "We also wish to accept that the more moderate leaders 
within 
the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] and the IFP 
(Inkatha Freedom Party) are rethinking their situation with the 
aim to follow the example set by the Ciskei," the statement said. 
  Transkei military leader Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa in welcoming 
Ciskei's move said there was no doubt in his mind that the 
action by the homeland's government would imporve stability in 
the region. "The future of the civil servants and security 
forces in Ciskei would strengthen these workers to redouble 
their efforts in supporting the democratic changes which are 
taking place now and after the elections. 
  "The move by Ciskei should also make things easy for the 
finalisation of the regional government and other related 
issues, as far as the eastern Cape -- which includes Port 
Elizabeth, Ciskei, Border and Transkei -- is concerned," Gen 
Holomisa said. 
  He said Transkei wished that the relationship among the 
political organisations in the region would improve as a result 
of Ciskei's move. "I hope that the government employees in 
Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu will seriously consider pressurising 
their political heads that their future depends on their future 
paymaster, which would be a government of national unity. 
Therefore they must demand to be catered for in the deal." 
  An African National Congress spokesman said any move by 
members of the Freedom Alliance to join the ranks of people who 
wanted democracy should be welcomed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner National Front and Freedom </F>
Alliance leader, General Constand Viljoen, by South African 
Broadcasting Corporation presenter Marietta Kruger in the 
television news studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Kruger] In the studio tonight we have one of the 
leaders of the Freedom Alliance, General Constand Viljoen. Good 
evening General. 
  [Viljoen] Good evening. 
  [Kruger] We have just heard that the Ciskei government is 
fully prepared to cooperate with the Transitional Executive 
Council. Can one infer from this that there is a split in the 
Freedom Alliance? 
  [Viljoen] No, I don't think that we should regard this as a 
split. Brigadier Oupa Gqozo did meet with alliance leaders and 
he explained his position to us. He is in an unenviable 
position, in the sense that he is isolated and is experiencing 
pressure and threats from the government and the ANC [African 
National Congress]. What is obviously not a very level playing 
field is causing Brigadier Oupa Gqozo a lot of hardship. For 
example, he is pressured by his own officers, who say that they 
will not be integrated into a future defense force because the 
South African Defense Force told them that unless their leader 
decides to participate in the transitional councils, they will 
not be eligible for selection for the future defense force. So 
within the Ciskei there is this intense pressure on Brigadier 
Gqozo. He is in a very difficult position. He did explain it 
to us. It will probably be discussed at the forthcoming 
leadership meeting on Friday. 
  [Kruger] Do you expect more parties to follow Ciskei's 
example? 
  [Viljoen] No, I do not think so. I think a very clear stand 
has been taken by the Freedom Alliance. We have, without doubt, 
walked down the road of negotiations. Recently we declared that 
we are fully prepared to negotiate. We even said that if 
negotiations are successful and if everything goes well, then we 
will consider, if our controlling bodies approve, to participate 
in such an election -- in the process -- so I do not think there 
is any danger of people walking out. I think we should first 
see if we can solve the negotiations issue. As you know, we are 
a negotiating alliance and only when the negotiations issue is 
solved, then we will consider the possibility of forming a 
political or other alliance. 
  [Kruger] General Viljoen, thank you.

<F P=106> [Editorial] </F>
  [Text] When SABC-TV [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation-Television] decided to broadcast, in a series of 
five programs, the history of the ANC [African National 
Congress] before the general election, it should have realized 
that this would provoke strong reaction from opposition 
political parties. 
  It is, of course, not easy for any institution in the world 
to operate as a so-called state broadcaster on taxpayers' money. 
There has to be constant, careful planning in order not to 
provoke too much adverse criticism. Even in a Western democracy 
like Britain, the BBC is constantly criticized, especially over 
political matters, and during a run-up to an election. In such 
instances the so-called state broadcaster has to provide 
explanations to the taxpayer and the licensees on whose finances 
it depends. 
  When the SABC-TV indicated that it was to begin broadcasting 
a series on the ANC's "struggle," it was being unbelievably 
naive, totally inconsiderate, or blatantly biased. People who 
are not ANC supporters come to one conclusion, and not without 
any reason: This series is part of ANC's election campaign. 
  The tendency was to reject any kind of interference in the 
so- called state broadcaster during the so-called "apartheid 
era." One can rightly ask if the authorities then would have 
allowed this type of program to be broadcast. The same applies 
to the program exalting ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation -- ANC military wing] last Thursday. How such a program 
can contribute to the so-called leveling of the political 
playing field is beyond any comprehension. 
  The present SABC authorities should use wisdom in handling 
political material. Surely the persistent reports of control by 
an ANC coterie under the leadership of Dr. Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri 
cannot be denied. These reports are supported by the 
disclosures of Dr. Matsepe-Casaburri's close links with the ANC 
in the past. She has a right to her personal political 
preferences, but in her position she should set them aside. 
  The news about the appointment of an outspoken ANC-member to 
an important executive post at the SABC, as well as this week's 
announcement of the ANC candidate lists in which the names of 
three SABC Board members appear (one declined immediately), 
arouses more suspicion. What became of the excellent rule of 
political impartiality when appointing members to the board? 
This very board, put together after much publicized hearings by 
a panel of so-called "uninvolved" jurists? 
  The SABC's latest step places a heavy responsibility on 
well- 
known non-supporters of the ANC within the SABC Board, such as 
academic Christo Viljoen, churchman Professor Pieter Potgieter, 
and communications expert Professor Arrie de Beer. 
  The actions of SABC-TV leaves us with some serious questions 
on how the Independent Broadcast Authority will from now on 
divide the radio waves and matters regarding television among 
the different interested parties. What will happen if the ANC 
on 27 April becomes the senior partner in a government of 
national unity? 
  For the SABC Board there is only one solution: To establish 
a truly impartial and neutral tradition regarding political 
issues before a new constitutional dispensation. The time has 
come for all who are exposed to the SABC services, as well as 
those in the administration who steadfastly support justice and 
fairness to stand up and be counted. 
  Surely, now is not the time to be silent.

  [Text] Radio Pretoria has defied the Home Affairs 
Department's refusal to grant the station a further broadcasting 
license. The Afrikaans right-wing radio station went on the air 
at 6 O'clock [0400 GMT] this morning. According to a source 
close to the station, trenches and other defensive positions 
which have been dug around the Donkerhoek broadcasting site east 
of Pretoria have been manned by the station's supporters in 
anticipation of a police raid. Radio Pretoria mainly broadcasts 
traditional Afrikaans music, as well as talk shows, interviews 
and news bulletins with a distinct right-wing anti-government 
feeling.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Split Emerges in Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg THE STAR 
in 
English on 12 January in a page 12 editorial says: "Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] leader Constand Viljoen is 
whistling in the dark. Faced with Ciskei's decision to join the 
TEC [Transitional Executive Council], contribute 250 troops to 
the National Peacekeeping Force and participate unconditionally 
in the election, he insists that this does not presage a split 
in the Freedom Alliance." Since the alliance was formed to 
consolidate opposition to the TEC and to make participation in 
the election conditional on fulfillment of demands for 
amendments to the Interim Constitution, "commonsense exposes 
Viljoen's stance as futile and stonewalling." The AVF is warned 
that opinion polls conducted under the auspices of the Institute 
for Multiparty Democracy show that "white support for the CP 
[Conservative Party] -- the cornerstone of the Volksfront -- has 
dropped from 30 to 20 percent in recent months." The CP's 
decline shows that "whites are becoming increasingly resigned to 
the pending changes. Unless the Volksfront makes a major 
tactical shift towards participation in the next few weeks, it 
will lose further support and be pushed ineluctably to the 
sidelines." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Options for Freedom Alliance Partners -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 12 January in a page 6 editorial 
believes it would "be wrong" to interpret Ciskei's decision to 
join the TEC as "a signal that the other components of the 
Freedom Alliance are also about to yield to the pressures to 
join the political mainstream" since Ciskei is "the weakest and 
least significant member of the alliance." However, the other 
Freedom Alliance members' options "are dwindling." "As the poll 
conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council and the 
Institute for Multiparty Democracy shows, SA's electorate has 
not taken kindly to the boycotting of negotiations or extremist 
policies. Despite the messy and violent political process of 
the past few years, the white right wing has stagnated -- in 
electoral terms if not in volubility. Even more dramatic is the 
news for Buthelezi -- the poll shows he has lost some 40 percent 
of his black support in Natal over the past year as he 
increasingly withdrew into isolation in Ulundi." But should 
Buthelezi discard his "'spoiler'" reputation and commit himself 
and his party to contesting the election, "a top post in a 
coalition regional government, either with the NP [National 
Party] alone or with the ANC too, is well within the realms of 
possibility. That decision will determine whether history 
judges him as an important regional leader, or the Savimbi of 
South Africa." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  IFP Urged To Join Negotiations -- Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 10 January in its page 8 editorial hopes "common 
sense will prevail" and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] will 
decide to return to negotiations despite the recent decision by 
its Central Committee that Inkatha would not join in the 
election, nor participate in any structures of the TEC. "The 
IFP has perfected the art to sound hopeful and then destructive 
in quick succession. As part of the Freedom Alliance, it is 
still part of the negotiations. Its statement should be 
therefore seen as negotiation rhetoric." It should be clear 
within the next few days whether the process can reach finality 
without the IFP. One can only hope that "healthy minds and 
compromise will be the victors." The step not to obey 
Transitional Executive Council structures has serious 
implications. The IFP will be directly challenging the authority 
and powers of a structure instituted by Parliament should it 
offer resistance. "This could lead to serious confrontation with 
tragic consequences." 
  ANC Candidates -- A second editorial on the same page 
criticizes the ANC for placing names on its election candidates' 
list without prior consultation with, and obtaining permission 
from the candidates involved. "The ANC, which aspires to assume 
a leading role in the country's government, will have to cut out 
such impetuosity and opportunism in future."

  [Text] The National Assembly, which resumed its proceedings 
on 7 January 1994, met at Kigobe Palace today to elect the 
president of the Republic. Out of the 80 parliamentarians, only 
54 attended. The National Party of Unity and Progress 
parliamentary group did not attend. 
  Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the National Assembly 
chairman, 
indicated that in accordance with the amendment to Article 85 of 
the constitution, the National Assembly was to continue its 
session and elect the president of the Republic, but added, 
however, that a procedure had to be respected. Mr. 
Ntibantunganya indicated that the government had not yet 
promulgated the law amending Article 85 of the constitution, and 
that consequently the National Assembly was suspending its 
proceedings.

  [Text] Discussions on the issue of the formation of the 
national police have finally begun in Lusaka. The National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] did try for a 
new postponement, but UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin 
Beye did fall for it and he made the two delegations attend a 
face-to-face meeting. Joao Ligio, the People's Television of 
Angola correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  [Begin Ligio recording] Sources close to the Lusaka peace 
talks have admitted the possibility that significant progress 
may have been made during a plenary meeting on the issue of the 
national police. The reason for that opinion is that this 
morning UN Special Representative Blondin Beye turned down a new 
UNITA request for the ad hoc commission's proceedings to go into 
recess yet again. When it was thought that the commission would 
be discussing the clarifications the government team made 
yesterday concerning the organizational law of the national 
police, the UNITA team once again proceeded to take up the rest 
of the working hours this morning with new clarification 
demands. This time, though, the UN special representative did 
not fall for it. He hardened his stance and invited the Black 
Cockerel negotiating team to turn up in the afternoon with 
logical documents concerning defense principles and an analysis 
of the first point. Blondin Beye expressed his belief that the 
clarifications had been adequate, so he decided to continue 
proceedings with the documents (?being viewed as finished). 
  The two sides have already begun discussing the general 
principles of the document on the police force. That document 
contains some 12 points, of which four have already been dealt 
with. The meeting is to resume tomorrow with a discussion of 
Point 5, whose content [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 11 SAPA -- The government and the 
African National Congress [ANC] were planning against violence, 
State President F W de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela 
announced at a joint news conference in Pretoria on Tuesday. The 
government would spend the next few days working on the plan 
following "important inputs from the ANC's side", said Mr de 
Klerk. 
  The two sides will meet next week to discuss the composite 
plan. The joint press conference was the first in South Africa 
since the signing of the Pretoria Minute in August, 1990. 
  Tuesday's four-hour talks at Pretoria's Union Buildings were 
attended by chief negotiators Roelf Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa, 
as well as Justice and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee. 
  Mr Mandela noted the talks were conducted in a "spirit of 
reconciliation". "You will see that none of us has a blue [color 
as received] eye," the ANC president quipped. 
  The leaders discussed more talks with the Freedom Alliance 
to 
try to persuade it to join negotiations. 
  Mr de Klerk said such an approach would be decided on "in 
the 
next few days". He reiterated the government and the ANC wanted 
the Freedom Alliance to be part of the country's constitutional 
settlement, adding that no effort would be spared "even at this 
stage". 
  Mr Mandela said he had briefed the state president on his 
Monday meeting with Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, 
whereafter Dr Hartzenberg said there was no point in continuing 
talks with the anc on the Afrikaner demand for a "volkstaat" 
[Afrikaner homeland]. 
  Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela repeated their condemnation of 
unacceptably high levels of violence, particularly on the East 
Rand and in parts of Natal. "(It) must come to an end," Mr de 
Klerk said. He conceded the problem had been exacerbated by 
Sunday's shooting during a tour of Katlehong by Mr Ramaphosa and 
South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo. 
  Mr Mandela said if violence was to be ended specific 
proposals should not be publicised at present. 
  Mr de Klerk said he remained confident, however, that a free 
and fair election was possible on April 27, but areas such as 
the East Rand and Natal "must be stabilised".

  [Text] They met in a spirit of reconciliation and 
considerable progress was made to end violence. That, says 
State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National 
Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, is the success recipe other 
political leaders should use to make free and fair elections 
possible in South Africa. Agreements or proposals during 
today's crucial meeting were not, however, released to the 
media. Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela confirmed that a 
comprehensive anti-violence plan containing ANC proposals and 
government initiatives would be drawn up. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Gary Alfonso] After four hours 
of 
critical talks at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Mr. de Klerk 
and Mr. Mandela emerged to say, against media expectation, that 
the government and the ANC had formulated a joint plan to curb 
violence. Although both leaders agreed not to release sensitive 
details to the media, they again condemned recent senseless 
attacks such as the Katlehong shooting. They, however, 
confirmed that future efforts to end the carnage in troubled 
areas would have to be facilitated through strong 
community-based projects. 
  [De Klerk] A very strong action, coupled also with solution- 
orientated and community-orientated actions will be necessary 
and we will be focusing, in the days to come, very strongly -- 
now having had also the important input from the ANC's side. 
Secondly, we discussed the constitutional situation and the 
need for further interaction with the Freedom Alliance. We are 
thinking inclusively. We want the significant parties within the 
Freedom Alliance to become part of the process. 
  [Mandela] The progress that we have made today is a very 
encouraging one. That crisis will emerge if Mr. de Klerk 
remains deaf to the proposals that I am making, but from what 
has happened today it does appear that we are making very good 
progress. 
  [Alfonso] Referring to the breakdown in talks with 
right-wing 
negotiators, Mr. Mandela remained firm on the impossibility of a 
volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners, but said he hoped the 
right- wing would prefer dialogue to civil war. 
  [Mandela] I urged Ferdie Hartzenberg yesterday that he must 
heed -- and his colleagues -- must refrain from inciting that 
section of the Afrikaners who want a separate homeland -- that 
they must avoid the situation where that section is going to be 
isolated and become the target for the anger of the majority of 
the people of South Africa, black and white. 
  [Alfonso] Mr. de Klerk confirmed that the government had 
proof that extreme right-wing elements had been involved in 
various incidents of township violence. 
  [De Klerk] From time to time right-wing people are directly 
involved in specific incidents and evidence has been uncovered 
and, therefore, we must assume that there are elements in their 
ranks who are involved in violent actions 
  [Alfonso] Both leaders have agreed to meet again next week 
to 
discuss and finalize the joint strategy against violence and 
other constitutional issues. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Government communique issued in Bangui on 12 January; read </F>
by Permanent Undersecretary Koumakoye Ngourouma] 
  [Text] The Central African Government will announce in time 
the measures adopted by the heads of state of the franc zone at 
their meeting in Dakar on 10-11 January on the devaluation of 
the CFA franc which it approved. However, since this morning it 
has been observed that certain panic stricken businessmen closed 
their shops in order to change the prices of their commodities. 
  Even thought it is normal for businessmen to close their 
shops in order to take stock, the government does not appreciate 
their attempts to increase prices arbitrarily. Consequently, 
the government condemns this practice and asks the Central 
African people to remain calm. The government recalls that the 
prices of commodities currently in the warehouses awaiting 
customs clearance and those ordered before the devaluation will 
not be increased. However, there are dossiers that will be 
examined case by case [words indistinct]. 
  Furthermore, the government demands those businessmen who 
closed their shops this morning in order to change the price 
tags to stop the operation and obey the present instructions. 
Severe controls will be taken to this effect in order to detect 
defaulters. A word to the wise is sufficient.

  [Text] In a communique issued on 9 January, the government 
announced that it had met the demands of the Federation of 
Chadian Trade Unions [USC]. The government also called for the 
resumption of work in the public sector. However, for the USC, 
these demands have not been met. Its secretary general, Jibril 
Hassan Hamdallah, explains the situation to Nourem Souleymane 
Nourel: 
  [Begin recording] [Hamdallah] This government statement is 
not exact. Since 11 December, when we launched the strike order, 
until now, few civil servants have been paid their two months' 
salaries. The majority have not been paid. This concerns 
workers in Ndjamena. Regarding the interior, no payments have 
been made yet. From telegrams coming from Bongor, Moungare, 
Maho, Sar, Moundou, and everywhere, I am told that they have not 
been paid a single month's salary. Negotiations with the 
government began on 17 December. On 21 December when we held 
the last meeting, the government affirmed that it had paid two 
months' salaries to all civil servants until the end of the 
first week of January 1994. Today is 11 January and the 
situation is what I have just described. In the interior 
payments have not even begun. 
  Regarding the negotiations, they have been interrupted since 
31 December -- as I have been saying -- and they have not yet 
resumed because the payment of two months' salary arrears in 
Ndjamena and three months' salary arrears in the interior is the 
condition for the continuation of the negotiations. But until 
now, this condition has not been met. We are waiting for the 
government to fulfill its promise and also see to it that civil 
servants in the interior are paid a month's additional salaries. 
We will be ready for negotiations at any time, but for now, no 
one has contacted us and so the negotiations are at a standstill. 
  [Nourel] What solutions do you envisage? 
  [Hamdallah] An order must be given to pay workers, for 
example. In certain prefectures, the funds are available but the 
treasurers say they have not been instructed to pay; we are not 
sure why this is the case. There are funds in the departments. 
The prime minister himself informed us that there was 60 
million CFA francs in Sar and 60 million CFA francsin Moundou. 
But no payments have been made since the prime minister said 
this. We do not know why civil servants are not being paid.

  [Text] In Gabon, a delegation of opposition members, most 
of them candidates in the 5 December presidential elections, 
have been prevented from leaving the country. In other words, 
the authorities are forbidding certain opposition members to 
leave the country. Mr. Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe, leader of 
the Gabonese Party of Progress, explains. He spoke to Ghislaine 
Dupont: 
  [Begin recording] [Agondjo] We are, in effect, forbidden to 
leave the country, and we regard this as a very serious measure. 
It violates freedom of movement; it violates the charter of 
fundamental freedoms in Gabon, and it even violates the 
constitution. It is very, very serious because we are moving 
slowly towards a return to dictatorship. 
  [Dupont] Do you think that you are under house arrest? 
  [Agondjo] It practically boils down to that; it is 
practically house arrest. 
  [Dupont] What do you think the authorities are afraid of? 
  [Agondjo] I think the authorities are afraid of the truth. 
They are afraid that if we go abroad we might tell the 
international community about what is really happening in Gabon, 
in particular what happened on 5 December 1993. [end recording] 
  That was Mr. Agondjo, the leader of the Gabonese Party of 
Progress. The coordinating body of the opposition of Gabon met 
today. It is to continue its consultations tomorrow to decide 
on the response it will give to the Libreville government.

  [Text] Libreville, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Several Gabonese 
opposition leaders who planned to fly to Paris were banned from 
leaving the country by police officers who detained them at the 
airport, an opposition spokesman said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Fighting broke out between the police, hurling teargas, and 
the opposition leaders' bodyguards after the security forces, 
"without explanation," stopped the politicians from boarding 
their flight here late Tuesday, the spokesman said. 
  A delegation of seven people, including four men who ran 
against President Omar Bongo in elections that returned him to 
office last December, turned up at the airport to carry out a 
briefing tour to France and the United States, the spokesman 
said. 
  The four were Jules-Aristide Bourdes-Ogouliguende, Alexandre 
Sambat, Jean-Pierre Lemboumba and Pierre-Claver 
Maganga-Moussavou. 
  The incident was the first of its kind since the December 5 
poll, sources said. In recent weeks, several leaders of the 
opposition in the West African country have travelled abroad, 
notably to Paris.

  [Text] Libreville, 13 Jan (AFP) -- Gabonese President Omar 
Bongo is of the opinion that the country's opponents "have 
visited France enough." He stated this to justify that fact 
that several of these opponents were barred from flying out to 
Paris from Libreville yesterday evening. 
  In an interview published today in the government daily 
L'UNION, the head of state added that the "government has 
decided that everyone should remain here. We shall see. There 
is no need to flee. They have visited France enough," Mr. Bongo 
said. "We have said that all those who want to sow disorder in 
the country will face the rigors of the law. Nobody has the 
monopoly of street demonstrations and fisticuffs...If because 
some people have lost an election they decide to set up a 
parallel government and a High Council of the Republic [HCR], 
that means provocation...They should even be jailed but we feel 
there is no need to do so," the head of state added. 
  Following the first round of the 5 December presidential 
election which saw the reelection of Mr. Bongo, the opposition 
candidates proclaimed the victory of one of their members, 
Father Paul Mba Abessole, who placed second according to 
official results. Mr. Abessole subsequently set up his 
"government" and an HCR. 
  "When the opponents travel to Paris they call Bruno Delaye," 
President Francois Mitterrand's adviser on African affairs, and 
afterwards "they go to Boulevard Saint Honore and then say they 
are from the Elysee Palace," the Gabonese head of state stated, 
adding that "they go to France to tell stories to the 
newspapers." 
  On Tuesday evening, an opposition delegation which had 
planned an "explanation tour" to France and the United States, 
was barred from leaving the country at Libreville airport. 
Scuffles broke out at the airport between policemen, who fired 
teargas, and the bodyguards of these opponents among whom were 
four candidates in the presidential election, namely 
Jules-Aristide Bourdes Ogouliguende, Alexandre Sambat, 
Jean-Pierre Lemboumba, and Pierre-Claver Maganga-Moussavou. The 
opposition condemned this as an "obstacle to freedom of movement 
and an unacceptable violation of human rights."

  [Text] The political situation is still at an impasse in 
Zaire. The radical opposition, which supports Prime Minister 
Etienne Tshisekedi, is refusing to sign agreements negotiated 
since 10 December. Talks were adjourned last month; the parties 
of the presidential tendency refused to accept Mr Tshisekedi as 
legal prime minister. Marshal Mobutu then issued an ultimatum 
to the opposition, which expires today at midnight. Here is the 
reaction of Joseph Olengakoye, the envoy of Prime Minister 
Tshisekedi. At the moment he is visiting Paris. 
  [Begin recording] [Olengakoye] We have noted that Mr. Mobutu 
is aware of the problem and has issued an ultimatum because the 
impasse in Zaire is related to Mr. Mobutu's own will. He has 
given himself an ultimatum. I can tell you sincerely that, 
having arrived at the expiry of Mr. Mobutu's ultimatum, if he 
does not find a solution that meets the aspirations of our 
people, there will be incalculable consequences, and we will 
attack democratically on all fronts. 
  [Reporter Dupont] What else can you do? 
  [Olengakoye] The people will demonstrate, and Mr. Mobutu 
will 
rule over corpses. 
  [Dupont] The UN secretary general has put foward a new 
proposal to the Zairean president. Do you think this proposal 
could unblock the situation? 
  [Olengakoye] I think that the proposal is to ask Mr. Mobutu 
to give in to the will of the majority, the will of our people. 
We have the consequences of 30 years. If we are where we are 
today, it is because Mr. Mobutu has not managed to govern this 
people. This means that our people are determined to find a 
solution according to what they think [as heard], and this is 
not what Mr. Mobutu thinks. [end recording] 
  Joseph Olengakoye, the envoy of Etienne Tshisekedi. He was 
interviewed by Ghislaine Dupont.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 12 Jan (KNA) -- The vice president and 
minister for planning and national development, Professor George 
Saitoti, today held fruitful discussions with the leader of a 
Japanese economic and technology cooperation mission currently 
in the country. At the head of the high level mission is Mr. 
Masao Sawaki, special assistant to the minister for foreign 
affairs, who was accompanied by the ambassador of Japan to 
Kenya, Ms. Ginko Sato, during the discussions at the vice 
president's office at the Treasury in Nairobi. 
  The vice president assured Japan of the Kenya Government's 
commitment to the principles of good governance, transparency, 
and accountability. Prof. Saitoti assured further of the 
government's commitment to the maintenance of security and the 
protection of lives for both the local and international 
communities in Kenya. This was in response to concerns expressed 
by Mr. Sawaki on the two issues. 
  Mr. Sawaki had told the vice president that Japan's 
assistance would only go to those countries that practiced good 
governance, transparency, accountability, and respect for human 
rights. Mr. Sawaki had also said that the international 
community would not be willing to work in countries where their 
lives were at risk. 
  Prof. Saitoti stated that the isolated incidents of 
insecurity were not internal but of induced [as received] nature 
associated with conflicts in neighboring countries. He said 
that some of the fleeing refugees brought with them into the 
country weapons that were used to commit crimes. 
  Prof. Saitoti underlined that His Excellency President 
Daniel 
arap Moi was involved with peace initiatives in the African 
region in the realization that there would be no peace in one 
particular country if others were in turmoil. 
  The vice president regretted the drought scourge sweeping 
many parts of the republic which, he said, had adverse effects 
on the country's economy. He said the country was forced to 
purchase foodstuffs to meet the deficit at commercial prices and 
appealed for donors' and agencies' assistance. The country, he 
said, was further reeling down with high unemployment, but he 
observed that this state could only be changed through growth in 
the economy. 
  The vice president emphasized that the government was 
serious 
in her efforts to bring further down the population growth and 
reported that the situation had assumed a downward trend. He 
said the biggest challenge for the country has been a major 
slowdown of the economy, but the government was doing everything 
possible to turn things around. Prof. Saitoti stressed that the 
government had liberalized many areas of the economy to make it 
stable. He said that the government had demonstrated its 
seriousness by implementing far-reaching structural economic 
measures. 
  Prof. Saitoti underlined that the government had effected 
major political and economic changes in the recent past. The 
country now enjoys a participatory multiparty democracy, he 
said, adding that the government would not relent in her efforts 
of real democratization and promoting a market-oriented economy. 
  During the discussions Mr. Sawaki said that his government 
considered Kenya as a priority country in Africa and that is why 
the country received the highest amount of Japanese aid. He 
said Kenya's success is fundamental, to be replicated in other 
areas. He underlined that his country placed emphasis on 
environmental and population-related programs and warned that no 
part of the aid should be diverted to military purposes since 
this could result in the suspension of the aid package. 
  The vice president thanked the Japanese Government for its 
assistance to Kenya, observing that every area of the economy 
had benefited from Japanese aid. He mentioned the Kenya 
Broadcasting Corporation, and various roads and bridges among 
major beneficiaries and in particular highlighted the Jomo 
Kenyatta College of Agriculture and Technology as a living 
testimony of economic cooperation between the two nations.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--The United Somali Party [USP], 
in coordination with the rest of Somali forces, has announced 
its support for the UN decision to relocate UN offices in 
Somalia from Mogadishu to various parts of the country. 
  A statement issued today by USP representatives in Cairo 
notes that the USP and a number of Somali forces have pressed 
for such a move for more than two years. The statement says 
that the move will help curb the power of certain irresponsible 
groups that made financial gains and got media attention due to 
their blackmail of UN organizations. 
  In their statement, Somali forces express support for the UN 
decision to deploy about 16,000 soldiers to protect public 
facilities, convoys, and refugees. The decision, chosen from 
among three options submitted by UN Secretary General Dr. Buturs 
Ghali to the UN Security Council, is reasonable and correct, the 
statement says.

  [Text] The government of Tanzania says it will not allow 
the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] movement to use its territory 
as a base for hostilities against South Africa. The secretary 
general of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party, Mr. Horace 
Kolimba, said Tanzania will not be used as a base for hostile 
actions and will not allow military training camps in that 
country any more. 
  Mr. Kolimba told a news conference in Harare today that 
Tanzania does not want to be seen as complicating things in 
South Africa. His comments follow reports that the Tanzanian 
government handed a strongly worded letter to the PAC's 
representative in Tanzania, condemning recent violence by the 
PAC in South Africa.

  [Text] Kampala, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Ugandan Lord's Army rebels 
have agreed to surrender on condition that the government gives 
them money to help them start new lives and guarantees them 
security, officials said Tuesday. The rebel movement, formerly 
known as the Holy Spirit Movement and led by priestess Alice 
Lakwena, expressed their intention to come out of the bush when 
they met a government delegation headed by former president Tito 
Okello. 
  The meeting took place in Agik forest near the northwestern 
town of Gulu on Monday. Rebel leader Joseph Kony, who claims to 
be guided by the holy spirit, attended the talks for the first 
time. The Lord's Army, who fought to overthrow the government of 
President Yoweri Museveni, are blamed for killing hundreds of 
civilians in northern Uganda during the past six years.

  [Text] Lusaka, the Zambian capital, may be hosting the 
Angolan peace talks which appear to provide reason for hope, but 
inside Angola the regime led by Eduardo dos Santos is preparing 
for war. According to [words indistinct] Luanda is making its 
final preparations to launch major attacks on strategic National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled 
areas in northern and northwestern Angola. Luanda's Futungo de 
Belas Palace is using South African and Portuguese mercenaries 
for that purpose. Those mercenaries are training forces in Cabo 
Ledo that will be used in that military adventure. 
  Should Luanda go on that offensive, it can count on 
sophisticated modern war materiel made in Brazil, the DPRK, and 
Argentina, among other countries determined to see the war 
continue in Angola.

  [Text] The issue of the National Police is still being 
discussed at a slow pace in Lusaka, as our reporter Joao Ligio 
confirmed on the phone: 
  [Begin Ligio recording] The Lusaka negotiating round is 
progressing at a slow pace on the issue of the formation of the 
national police. This morning the government delegation held a 
meeting, and the mediators met separately with the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] delegation in 
yet another attempt to persuade them to change their stand, 
which is distant from the mediators'proposal. The proposal, 
which is called the master document, follows a study by the 
observers on principles presented by each of the disputing sides. 
  In the afternoon the sides held a face-to-face meeting which 
resulted in all doubts on general principles being dissipated. 
The sides overcame the general principles and are getting ready 
to attend the first debate on specific issues in the Mulungushi 
Conference Center tomorrow. As we mentioned yesterday, the 
master document contains about 12 points, five of which have 
already been discussed. The remaining points concern the 
police's judicial statute, that is, to whom the police are 
answerable in future, to a civilian or a military court, as well 
as the integration of UNITA elements in the police. 
  There are rumors that Chief Beye intends to hold a meeting 
of 
the military leadership of the two sides in Sao Tome and 
Principe simultaneously with the Lusaka negotiating round, to 
possibly set a date for the cease-fire. However, both the 
government and UNITA reject the allegations on the supposed 
meeting as it has already been agreed that the military 
leadership's meeting will only be held 10 days after the signing 
of a formal agreement by the current Lusaka negotiating round.

  [Text] There are already reports of progress in the Zambian 
capital, Lusaka, where the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] have been debating 
the formation of the new national police for the past week. 
Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say Alioune Blondin Beye, special 
representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and the 
principal mediator of the peace talks, was able to bring the two 
sides' views closer on the formation of the police. 
  The same sources said yesterday that the two sides had 
reached an agreement that the police will be a state 
administration organ. Over the past few days, Alioune Blondin 
Beye has held separate meetings with the two sides to bring 
their stands closer on the issue of the police. 
  What now remains to be discussed are national 
reconciliation, 
the future UN role, UNITA's active participation in the 
government, and the second round of presidential elections. One 
thing is clear, though, the riot police will have to be banned. 
  It is expected that the parties will today begin to discuss 
specific principles connected with the national police and its 
formation modalities. Regarding the riot police, there is 
nothing to discuss. This wing of the MPLA-PT army which Spain 
formed, in violation of the Bicesse Accords, will definitely be 
banned in the interest of peace.

the capital of Ghana, said he is visiting a number of African 
countries to strengthen diplomatic relations. The Cuban foreign 
minister said his visit to Angola is very special. 
  [Begin Robaina recording, in Spanish] My visit to Angola is 
very special in that it constitutes a meeting with one part of 
the world, one part of the continent, a country with which we 
maintain historical relations. It is part of a diplomatic 
offensive considered timely by our country, which is 
fundamentally aimed [words indistinct] in that we cannot speak 
of a diplomatic offensive if we cannot have a meeting with this 
continent, with (?these countries), particularly with Angola 
[words indistinct]. [Passage indistinct] to be able to brief our 
Angolan friends on what is happening in Cuba at this moment and 
what problems we are facing. It is also very important for me 
to acquaint myself with the present situation in Angola. [end 
recording] 
  During his stay in Angola, Roberto Robaina will have working 
meetings with President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 
the prime minister, the president of the Parliament, and the 
Cuban community in Angola.

  [Text] The latest statements by Pedro Maria Tonha Pedale, 
the man who took over as the Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] defense minister thanks to the 
massacres he was able to carry out against the Angolan people, 
were today described by Angolan observers as being irresponsible 
and of a militarist nature. Those observers say that Pedale 
lacks universal democratic values. Instead, he prefers to 
sacrifice the national interest in exchange for the benefits he 
receives from Luanda's Futungo de Belas. Those observers see 
Pedale as a real criminal. They say that the special forces 
which concluded their military training yesterday were not 
trained to kill more South Africans or Zairians. They have been 
trained to attack the people and the opposition. They invited 
Pedale to define the type of democracy pursued by the MPLA-PT as 
its air force continues to kill Angolan people. Those observers 
also said that the MPLA-PT is waging war against the very people 
it claims to represent and they add that such a war can never be 
regarded as democratic.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Customs officials in Plymouth Harbor, in 
southern England, have detained a cargo ship suspected of 
carrying an illegal consignment of weapons destined for Angola. 
The ship, called [name indistinct], was registered as carrying 
agricultural equipment, but tanks were seen on board. The 
British authorities are now checking the ship's documentation to 
decide whether a license will be needed. The canvas covers did 
not manage to disguise the cargo, including tanks and artillery 
weapons believed to have been made in Russia and to be on their 
way to Angola. [passage omitted] 
  The customs authorities at Plymouth Harbor suspected that 
war 
materiel was intended for Angola. Now the British authorities 
must make sure that those weapons are not meant for the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which is 
facing a UN arms embargo. The Angolan Government's army is 
mainly equipped with war materiel made in the former Soviet 
Union and it is no longer under an arms embargo. In any event, 
it needs a (?transit) license, which appears not to be among the 
documentation. The authorities must establish the source, the 
destination, and the use that will eventually be made of the war 
materiel. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A lot is being said about bloody Friday, 22 January 
1993, but the truth is still far from being revealed. This is 
because Luanda is doing all it can to hide its involvement in 
the crime. Thousands of citizens of the Bakongo tribe were 
killed in Luanda on that day. Thousands of others were 
assaulted and had their property looted, while the government 
and the press under its control watched silently in complicity. 
  A report on the massacre was published yesterday by the 
government-dominated Parliament chaired by Franca van Dunem, and 
the Luanda government washed its hands, saying it was an 
isolated incident. Milton Kilandamoko, an Angolan politician, 
reacted to the masquerade. 
  [Begin recording] [Kilandamoko] We think that is not true. 
First of all, I must say this parliamentary report was made a 
long time ago. It has not been published until now because the 
ruling party wanted to make certain alterations. Our confidence 
in Parliament consequently has been erased. I do not believe in 
the report. The Bakongo people do not believe it at all. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You continue to believe that the 
bloody Friday violence last January had ethnic causes? 
  [Kilandamoko] Absolutely, absolutely. There is no doubt 
about that. The armed elements involved in the violence even 
said why they were doing it. The government cannot, therefore, 
try to deceive people. It is clearly responsible for the 
violence. The police elements who carried out the massacre are 
government administration elements. This being the case, the 
government is responsible and it is its duty to respond. Only 
these elements would be brought before a court, while the 
government washes its hands. That is not justice. It has 
referred the case to Parliament and the Parliament tried to 
spare the government. 
  [Reporter] This means, therefore, that the parliamentary 
report is not correct and the Bakongo people will continue to 
demand justice. 
  [Kilandamoko] Absolutely. This report is a pure lie. We do 
not agree with it. I, personally, as a Bakongo, do not agree 
with it, and the Bakongo people think in the same way. 
  [Reporter] What are you going to do now? 
  [Kilandamoko] Well, first of all, we think the government 
must be brought before judicial institutions. Here in Angola, 
it is not customary for the government to be called to answer. 
A person can be killed by the police, an armed civilian can be 
killed by the government, the person will be buried and the case 
will end there. We think that our country is developing and the 
government must know that it is its duty to care for the life of 
the people. Parliament's failure to give priority to this case 
means that the same kind of justice that was applied during a 
one-party system continues to be applied in the country today.

  [Text] Luanda is on the verge of social unrest. The people 
are discontent because of the shortage of basic commodities for 
their survival. This atmosphere of instability is being caused 
by elements belonging to the government police, and outlaws 
armed by the government, who continue to raid the Boavista food 
warehouses near the port of Luanda. These warehouses belong to 
Lebanese businessmen who were brutally harassed by the 
government police recently. 
  Mario Paiva from the South African Radio said the turbulent 
situation experienced in Luanda presently is intolerable. He 
said one bag of flour is already costing 1.2 million kwanzas, 
while imported beer costs 500,000 new kwanzas. In the face of 
this situation, Luanda residents will experience a very 
difficult period in the coming days.

Mr. Festus Mogae, and the minister of foreign affairs, Dr. 
Gaositwe Chiepe. Present at Dr. Chiepe's office was the deputy 
speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. (Lemina Kgaganeng). 
  The delegation, which left Botswana this morning, came to 
familiarize themselves with the political and economic 
conditions in the country. 
  The vice president told the U. S. team that Botswana is very 
much involved with the economics and politics of the southern 
African region. He said the country appreciates the 
Congressmen's interest in Botswana. Mr. Mogae said it would 
also be appreciated if efforts in integrating the region's 
economies and finding peace in Mozambique, Angola, and South 
Africa are supported. He also briefed them about the Southern 
African Customs Union, SADC [Southern African Development 
Community], and the Community for Eastern and Southern Africa. 
  Earlier Dr. Chiepe told the U. S. team that the complex 
situation in South Africa needs a lot of patience, research, and 
discussions from all walks of life. She said she is happy that 
the whole world is now giving attention to South Africa. Dr. 
Chiepe said Botswana looks forward to South Africa joining SADC.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article:"Disbanding of Militiamen"] </F>
  [Text] The UN Operations in Mozambique began the process of 
disbanding private militiamen yesterday, collecting arms from 
these detachments in some industrial areas of the city of 
Maputo. The action is within the framework of disbanding 
irregular forces within the framework of the General Peace 
Accord. 
  A letter sent to our news desk a few hours later questions 
how one would now guarantee that warehouses suppling Maputo 
residents are protected. 
  The reply is not simple. The police corps cannot be 
everywhere and they do not have such specific missions as 
guarding shops and warehouses. 
  The solution seems to be for residents, businessmen and 
entities to use private security companies which are growing 
like mushrooms in the city, with means that make the Republic of 
Mozambique Police jealous. A militiaman was content to receive 
100,000 meticals, the private security companies vary between 
250 and 1,000 contos monthly per agent. Part of the amount will 
end up being paid by the consumers. 
  Who will benefit from the business? Those who saw the 
opportunity and put in action the appropriate mechanisms, namely 
the new businessmen linked to Mozambique's defense and security 
apparatus.

  [Text] According to the daily report of the UN Operations 
in Mozambique, Unomoz, no government soldier turned up at any of 
the government troop confinement centers yesterday. The 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] sent 173 men, including 
the first 61 soldiers to have turned up at Chipanzane assembly 
point in Inhambane Province. Only one of the 14 troop 
confinement centers allocated to Renamo remains empty. Eight of 
the government's 21 assembly points also remain empty. 
  Only 58 government soldiers have arrived at their assembly 
points since the beginning of this year. By contrast, Renamo 
has sent in 1,167 men over the same period. A total of 8,338 
government soldiers and 5,222 Renamo men have been confined so 
far, representing 24 percent of the expected total. Renamo is 
using 68 percent of the capacity of its centers, as opposed to 
33 percent by the government. 
  So far, there has been no explanation for the slow turnout 
of 
government forces at troop confinement points.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with press secretary to Zambian </F>
president, Richard Sakala, by reporter Steyn de Preuter on the 
"PM News Wrap" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has named two 
new cabinet ministers to replace those who resigned last week. 
Allegations of drug smuggling have rocked Chiluba's cabinet in 
recent weeks and cast doubt on the future of his government. 
Chiluba spokesman Richard Sakala says the reshuffle cannot be 
interpreted as an admission of guilt. 
  [Begin recording] [Sakala] He has made the reshuffle to 
replace ministers who had resigned, in particular, there were 
three ministers ... [changes thought] two ministers who have 
resigned -- the minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Vernon Mwaanga, 
and Princess Nakatindi. These were two cabinet ministers. Mr. 
Mwaanga, as I said was Foreign Affairs, and Princess Nakatindi 
was Community Development and Social Welfare. Now these two 
resigned in order to give government an opportunity to 
investigate allegations that have been made in the media and by 
some people, that they were involved in drug trafficking. They 
felt that an investigation could not be carried out effectively 
if they remained in office and, as a matter of principle, they 
decided to step down to allow for an investigation. 
  [De Preuter] Now how are you going to ensure that the 
investigations into these allegations will not be a cover-up? 
  [Sakala] Yes absolutely, the investigations will be done. We 
have, what we call the DEC, the Drug Enforcement Commission, 
which is a body that deals with nothing but investigations and 
prosecutions in the cases of drugs, and these matters have been 
referred to them and they will undertake an investigation, and 
obviously, at the end of it all they will produce a report for 
everybody to see. 
  [De Preuter] The Zambian people appeared to have lost faith 
in the Chiluba government as far as corruption and drug 
trafficking is concerned. What are you going to do to restore 
that confidence? 
  [Sakala] I don't know the basis of that conclusion, because 
yesterday at the press conference it was made very clear -- in 
fact the president did produce a report of investigations that 
have been undertaken into issues of corruption where ministers 
are involved. All the cases involving about five ministers, who 
are alleged to be involved in corruption, were fully 
investigated by the anti- corruption commission and where 
necessary steps were taken. The director of public prosecution 
was advised to consider prosecution, and where he felt it fit, 
he would prosecute. There is not a single minister who has been 
prosecuted for corruption because there has been no such 
corruption proved against them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The devaluation of the CFA franc was one of the 
topics discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting. The government 
plans to adopt protective measures to prevent indiscriminate 
price increases. The government is also planning to launch a 
sensitization and explanation campaign. Here is the report on 
the cabinet meeting deliberations presented by the government 
spokesman, Theodore Holo: 
  [Begin recording] [Passage omitted] The cabinet took note of 
the decision of the heads of state and government of the 14 
member states of the franc zone in Dakar, Senegal, on 11 January 
relating to the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc. After 
examining the report presented by the minister of trade and 
tourism on the foreseeable consequences, the cabinet envisaged a 
number of measures whose implementation can only be effective 
after the government has held discussions with its social 
partners and the business community. 
  In the meantime, preventive measures will be adopted to 
avoid 
any indiscriminate price increases throughout the national 
territory, and in order to stem the baneful effects of the 
devaluation on our economy and on the purchasing power of our 
hardworking people. A mass sensitization and explanation 
campaign will also be organized to enable our people in general 
and the business community in particular, to understand 
correctly the phenomenon of devaluation which, unfortunately, is 
being wrongly interpreted today. Consequently, the cabinet calls 
on all national as well as foreign businessmen to refrain from 
any restless action that could seriously jeopardize our young 
recovering economy. 
  Finally, the minister of public works and transport reported 
to the cabinet on the situation at Cotonou Airport where 
personnel of the Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and 
Madagascar [ASECNA] embarked on an indefinite strike as of 11 
January. From the report presented by the minister of public 
works and transport, it was observed that some ASECNA staff, who 
were individually requisitioned, in conformity with the 
prevailing laws, to perform minimum duties at the airport, 
simply reported to their work place but did not work, thus 
paralyzing air traffic at Cotonou Airport totally. 
  While recognizing that ASECNA staff have the right to strike 
under conditions defined by the law, the cabinet strongly 
condemned their refusal to perform minimum work. However, 
faithful to the spirit of dialogue and concertation which the 
government of democratic renewal has always demonstrated vis a 
vis its various social partners, the cabinet set up a 
ministerial delegation in charge of meeting ASECNA personnel 
today in order to examine with them the ways and means of 
reconciling their interests with those of their employers and 
our national economy. [end recording]

  [Text] The president of Burkina Faso whom our reporter met 
this morning sounded reassuring. Blaise Compaore, who traced 
the background of the Dakar meeting which led to the devaluation 
of the CFA franc, commented on the consequences of this measure 
on Burkina Faso. Here is President Compaore, speaking to Rock 
Patrice Ouedraogo. 
  [Begin recording] It is true that generally speaking the 
devaluation will affect our debt. We will certainly have a 
bigger debt to pay. It will affect household spending, 
particularly certain goods which are consumed domestically but 
which used to be imported and, surely, there will be the problem 
of revamping the economy. But, generally speaking, with a 
number of backup measures geared toward reducing debt, 
preserving the industrial atmosphere, protecting the consumption 
of essential commodities, and also with the support of the 
international community in financing our investments and 
programs and in some employment generating sectors, we believe 
all this will restore a measure of credibility to our country. 
This will particularly guarantee a higher national production 
and put us in better position to export our products by, 
naturally, boosting agricultural output. And, of course, there 
will definitely be increased external investments. Domestic 
savings was also one area identified as one that should offer 
more support to our economies. In short, therefore, with all 
these measures, coupled with a system of safeguarding what I 
earlier referred to as the industrial atmosphere, we hope that 
our economies will be put in a better position to face 
international competition and sustain the welfare of our people.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Office of the president, in </F>
Abidjan on 12 January; read by Communication Minister Danielle 
Boni-Claverie] 
  [Text] For about 15 years now all Ivorians have been 
experiencing the effects of the economic crisis, although the 
effect was felt more by peasant farmers and the low-income 
families of our country. This crisis was brought about mainly 
by the fall in the prices of our main agricultural produce for 
export, notably cocoa, coffee, cotton, palm oil, and rubber. As 
you know, the economic crisis is not limited to Cote d'Ivoire 
alone, it does not spare any country in Africa. 
  Since the beginning of the 1980's, most African countries 
have been coping with this external constraints through the 
implementation of structural adjustment programs and important 
reforms, demanding increasing sacrifices from the people, were 
effected. Of course, some considerable results were obtained, 
but it is sad to note that the hope we expected from these 
sacrifices has not as yet been sufficiently achieved. On the 
contrary, we note that the daily difficulties of the 
hard-working people have increased, which obviously calls for a 
reform in the economic strategy. 
  It is within this context that the heads of state of African 
countries, members of the franc zone, have just unanimously 
decided, in consultation with France and all their development 
partners, to use monetary adjustment as an instrument of 
economic policy. In fact, in the face of persistent economic 
and financial difficulties of each of their countries, and 
having the improvement of the living conditions of their people 
at heart, they feel that this measure will offer them new 
chances to attain the objectives of lasting economic growth and 
sustained development. To this end, with effect from 11 
January, the exchange rate of the CFA franc has been modified as 
follows: 100 CFA francs are equal to 1 French franc instead of 
50 CFA francs to 1 French franc. 
  This adjustment in the exchange rate of the CFA franc will 
considerably improve the competitiveness of our export 
commodities, considerably increase the level of productive 
investment, free our economic potentialities, and generate the 
creation of new jobs. This historic decision of African heads of 
state of the franc zone is the assertion of the solidarity, 
which had, through intensified cooperation, enabled us to make 
this zone a solid and dynamic monetary space for the benefit of 
all its members. The modification in the exchange rate of the 
CFA franc falls in line with the actions taken by our countires 
to successfully carry out their common project concerning 
particularly business laws, insurance settlements, social 
security, and the specific knowledge of economic and social 
realities. 
  Concerning our subregion, what must be stressed particularly 
is the rich prospects now open by the important project of the 
West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA, which has just 
been created, because regional integration will multiply the 
possibilities offered to each of our economies. The conditions 
for a revival of the economic growth are not clear. It is up to 
all -- businessmen, state functionaries, farmers, and private 
sector workers, and so on -- to take advantage of all these new 
opportunities created by the decision of the African heads of 
state of the franc zone and act in such a way that our country 
will, in unity, hard work, and peace, regain the exceptional 
performance it accomplished in the past. A special appeal is 
made to all private investors -- both nationals and foreigners 
-- to play their role in the development of our country. 
  Concerning the immediate effects of the modification in the 
exchange rate of our currency, it is worth stressing that the 
normalization of our relations with the international financial 
community will be translated into the regular payment of 
salaries in the public sectors and parastatals. Concerning the 
effects on prices, specific measures will be taken to mitigate 
the effects of price hikes. But already a selective lowering of 
taxes is envisaged with the intensification of financial 
management of the state with an attendant radical improvement in 
tax collection. The prime minister and minister of economy and 
finance will address the nation on this subject in the next few 
days to give all the details on all the necessary backup 
measures concerning this decision. 
  Ivorians and friends of Cote d'Ivoire, who are not used to 
devaluation so frequent in other countries, are called upon to 
display a sense of calm and confidence in the future of our 
country. They should receive the news of this devaluation as the 
signal for a new departure for more effort, for more prosperity, 
and profit.

  [Text] The CFA franc has been devalued by 50 percent as of 
0000 GMT last night. In other words, 1 French franc, which was 
worth 50 CFA francs, is now worth 100 CFA francs. Since the 
announcement of news of the devaluation yesterday, a lot of 
images have collapsed -- that of a friendly and generous France. 
And for most francophone countries, especially those in the 
franc zone, the attitude of France is felt as an apparent 
affront to solidarity, a form of injustice and even a betrayal. 
  For instance, in Gabon it is believed that with the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, the yard sale of the black 
continent has been set in motion. This perhaps harsh statement 
is tinged with more or less justified pessimism. Today, 
everyone knows that this devaluation will plunge all the 
countries of the zone into a maze of difficulties which they 
will now have to face all alone. These difficulties comprise a 
budget deficit, debt, a decrease in purchasing power, and 
unemployed youth, bringing in their stride the risk of social 
conflicts. 
  Our country, which is presented as one of the rare African 
countries likely to gain from the CFA franc devaluation, and 
which has for a long time prepared for this eventuality, hopes 
that the devaluation which has just been decided in Dakar will 
make for a better exploitation of its economic potential. 
  Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan returned to Abidjan this 
morning. The head of government has just participated in the 
deliberations of the dual-purpose summit on multinational 
company Air Afrique and the CFA franc. The heads of state and 
government of the franc zone -- as we very well know since 
yesterday -- have accepted the devaluation of the CFA franc by 
50 percent. While waiting for the news conference on this 
decision, here are the initial comments of the head of 
government on his return this morning from Dakar. He was 
talking to Rene Bah: 
  [Begin Duncan recording] At several meetings that we had 
with 
the national and international press, I indicated clearly that 
when an economy is sick, there are three types of measures to be 
taken. There is internal adjustment which is an important 
measure consisting of reducing state expenditure and increasing 
state revenue. The second measure is monetary adjustment while 
the third measure consists of a mixture of the two. In reality, 
in a case where internal adjustment does not yield sufficient 
results, monetary adjusment will complement the internal 
adjustment measure. This has positive elements and I will 
elaborate at length later. But first of all I must give an 
overall account to the head of state. 
  However, I simply wish to say that this measure will make 
our country more competitive and improve its chances of 
exporting abroad. That we are one of the relatively 
industrialized countries in Africa and therefore have a large 
export capacity worth over 400 billion CFA franc a year. So we 
can have a larger revenue. It is a positive measure since state 
revenue will increase. This means that the country will have 
more room for maneuver. It will especially enable us to solve 
the dogged problem of internal debt. This is something that we 
must not lose sight of. Moreover, it will enable us to increase 
internal savings and permit the rapatriation of capital from 
abroad, since there was an evident lack of confidence in our 
economy. 
  It will also permit the development of our local industries 
and what is important our local agricultural production. We 
shall have to consume much more of local produce because local 
prices of imported products will increase. So there are 
significant prospects for the country and it must be underlined 
that there will again be significant financial assistance to the 
country. We shall have the opportunity to develop all these at 
a news conference before the end of the week. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement by Industry and Commerce Minister Ferdinand Kacou </F>
Angoran on price regulations in Abidjan on 12 January] 
  [Text] Following the devaluation of the CFA franc on 12 
January and in accordance with Law 91/999 of 27 December 1991 
regarding competition and Decree No. 92/50 of 29 January 1992 on 
competition and price regulations, a draft decree, signed by the 
president of the Republic, stipulates that there has been a 
freeze on prices and profit margins on a certain number of 
products the list of which will be made known to you soon. This 
freeze takes effect from Wednesday, 12 January. 
  Thus, while awaiting the adoption of backup measures, the 
decision to freeze commodities is to enable the assessment of 
available stock of goods and determine how long it will take to 
dispose of this stock. This freeze on prices will not exceed 
three months. 
  Thus, considering Law 91/999 of 27 December 1991 concerning 
competition, considering Decree 92/50 of 29 January 1992 on 
competition regulations, considering Decree 93/PR10 of 11 
December 1993 on appointment of the prime minister, considering 
Decree 93/PR11 of 11 December 1993 on the appointment of the 
members of the government, considering Decree 93/921 of 30 
December 1993 fixing the functions of the government members, 
considering the approval of the competition commission, the 
Cabinet decrees: 
  Article 1: The prices and commercial profit margins, 
including taxes, of products, goods, and services whose list is 
appended to the present decree cannot be higher at both the 
production level and the various distribution stages than the 
ruling service charges on 12 January 1994. The administration 
has the authority to check stocks and prices as of 12 January 
1994. The provisions of the present decree are applicable for a 
period of three months effective 12 January 1994. The 
violations of this decree are sanctioned in accordance with the 
provisions of Law No. 91/999 of 27 December 1991 on competition. 
  Now, here is the list of commodities directly concerned by 
this decree: 
  Foodstuffs: meat, cold fish, palm oil, in barrel and 
unpacked; bread, bread flour, salt, yeast, milk, sugar, 
petroleum products, namely kerosene, premium, gasoil, [word 
indistinct], butane gas, fuel 180 and 380. 
  Public service tariffs: water, electricity, post and 
telecommunications, urban or interurban transport, and railway. 
Rice [words indistinct], university books and materials, school 
fees, telephone in classified hotels, medical consultation and 
hospital fees, pharmaceutical products, tariffs of vehicles 
equipped with meters, i.e., taxis; publicity tariffs in the 
press organs, and alcoholic drinks of less than six degrees, 
that is beer for ordinary consumption, fruit juice, coca cola, 
etc; cement, transistor and electric batteries, machete, file, 
matches, soap, spare parts for cars, bicycles, motorcycles, iron 
sheets, lubricating oil, printed wax, rent, iron rod, and table 
butter. 
  Such are, ladies and gentlemen, the contents of the decree 
signed by the president of the Republic, which stipulates in 
clear terms the prices of certain goods whose profit margins are 
frozen for three months to enable the administration to assess 
the existing stocks and reexamine the prices ruling on 12 
January.

  [Excerpts] In Dakar, the principle of devaluing our common 
currency, the CFA franc, has been accepted although leaders of 
the 14 members countries of the franc zone, are still examining 
the issue. In fact, a devaluation risks to have consequences on 
the purchasing power of the people of Niger. It will therefore 
be necessary to mitigate the social cost of the action. 
  With the very probable devaluation of the CFA franc, the 
uncertainty of the people of Niger is great, especially 
concerning the hike in prices and the significant fall in the 
purchasing power of workers which could cause obvious social 
upheavals with unpredictable consequences. To prevent such a 
situation, discussions began a long time ago at the Ministry of 
Finance and Plan to define and draw up relief measures capable 
of reducing the social cost of devaluation. To avoid inflation 
of prices of local products, the government hopes to take 
measures to avoid the increase in the prices of some local 
products. 
  Concerning imported goods, the authorities are thinking of 
subsidizing the cost of essential commodities. Concerning the 
debt, it will especially be necessary to seek its cancellation 
or to have it reduced. According to Mr. Abou Nasseba, head of 
the economic and social reform department, acting for the 
director of economic and financial journalism, the creation of a 
social fund of between 20 and 40 billion CFA francs has been 
envisaged. 
  [Begin recording] [Nasseba] This social fund will be used in 
mitigating the negative effects of devaluation in Niger. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What are the concrete that measures 
the government wishes to take to stop the increase in the prices 
of fuel and other commodities? 
  [Nasseba] Well, concerning energy, we have envisaged the 
holding of negotiations with our principal supplier which is 
Nigeria. 
  [Reporter] (?Presently), do we know what Nigeria's reactions 
will be following the devaluation of our currency? 
  [Nasseba] Personally, this morning I followed [words 
indistinct] which came yesterday and we must now adopt an 
economic policy which will apparently or totally favor us. In 
other words, Nigeria will return to the system of daily rates -- 
I think it is 22 naira to $1 -- so negotiations must begin with 
that country to reach an understanding in order to limit 
increases to relatively acceptable levels. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Concerning state functionaries, can we expect any 
salary increase in order to favor purchasing power of workers? 
  [Nasseba] Yes, but [words indistinct], unofficial according 
to the calculations made with the [words indistinct] proposed, a 
salary increase of almost 18 percent has been envisaged for the 
year 1994 and probably, concerning salary arrears, measures will 
be taken so that, at least, one or two months of arrears can be 
paid in an attempt to mitigate the initial shocks of the price 
hikes. At any rate, as a first step, there will be [words 
indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Oumar Konare in Bamako on 12 </F>
January by RTM reporter Brema Camara -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Konare] Devaluation was at the 
center of thorough and lengthy discussions for several months 
and even several years. Now we know the results. What I can 
say is that we must admit the failure of a certain policy that 
has been adopted in our countries for several months. We must 
also admit the failure of a certain cooperation policy. Our 
scope of choosing alternatives was very limited for several 
reasons. First, in monetary matters, we enjoy joint sovereignty 
with France which guarantees the convertibility of our currency. 
This sovereignty is also shared with other states. Second, we 
have currency problems because we have a currency that is common 
to 14 states. Third, each country is faced with economic 
situations in our own states and Mali is no different. 
  We have made a lot of efforts and adopted many measures 
aimed 
at redressing the situation. But it is clear that we have 
inherited a really bad situation. You have noticed that for 
almost 15 years we have put in place an internal adjustment 
program. But this program has not enabled us to solve the main 
problems. It was suicidal to hold on to that with its 
concomitant problems of layoffs, unemployment, lack of 
competitiveness, and also the flight of capital and lack of 
investment in the country. There are therefore no prospects. 
In the face of all this, it became necessary to adopt such a 
[word indistinct] measure. Of course, that will not be without 
problems, we must admit. We must succeed in suppressing [word 
indistinct]. We must also succeed in cushioning, in solidarity, 
the social effects, especially on the most exposed classes in 
the society. 
  But we think that it is possible for us to find the key to 
tomorrow if we manage the situation well by creating the 
conditions for greater competitiveness and a situation that 
favors investment. Ours is a country of farmers, herdsmen, and 
fishermen. Basically, it is a situation that can enable us to 
develop our national production. 
  On the industrial level it is possible today to develop our 
national production. You know our difficulties regarding fraud 
and the closure of enterprises here and there. I think these 
are real assets for our country. I expect all the democrats to 
form the largest possible front -- above partisan quarrels -- in 
order to face the new situation. It is this patriotic front 
that can enable us to take up the current challenge. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The devaluation has taken effect. It 
is a fact today. What can your government propose to Malians 
today in order to make the cup less bitter, especially for the 
civil servants? 
  [Konare] I think for several weeks, the government has asked 
itself many questions. The government -- the prime minister and 
the ministers -- will soon brief the public and all our economic 
and social partners on the decisions that have been adopted. 
The decisions that will be adopted at the national level will 
also be thoroughly explained. These decisions will be aimed at 
creating the conditions and giving answers to the daily concerns 
of the people. They will also be aimed at creating more 
solidarity and better remuneration of labor in rigor and 
discipline. This will be indispensable for us. The decisions 
will also be aimed at creating the conditions for 
competitiveness for investments to be made and national 
production developed, as I have said. Without doubt, they will 
be aimed at -- and I think this is indispensable -- 
strengthening our ability to take care of ourselves, move toward 
more regional integration, and basically reinforce solidarity 
among Africans. [end recording]

  [Text] The Nigerian Government has restated its commitment 
to a policy of good neighborliness with [break in reception]. 
Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, who stated this, said Nigeria 
was not an aggressor. The country only carried out a routine 
relocation of troops on its eastern border, a measure that was 
not designed to embarrass any of its neighbors. He said that if 
there was any misunderstanding between Nigeria and Cameroon, the 
issue was already being resolved at the diplomatic level. The 
troops' relocation, according to him, was normal and aimed at 
enhancing the safety of its citizens. 
  The Nigerian foreign minister, Mr. Babagana Kingibe, visited 
Cameroon last week on the border issue after which both 
countries agreed on a joint patrol to stem the clashes.

  [Text] Lagos, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Nigeria and Sierra Leone 
signed an agreement here Tuesday providing for the training and 
development of the Sierra Leonean Army, the official NEWS AGENCY 
OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported. Nigeria's chief of defence staff, 
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, signed the agreement on behalf of 
the head of state, General Sani Abacha, while Captain S.K. 
Cumba, the Sierra Leonean under-secretary of state for defence, 
signed for his country. 
  Abubakar said the accord was in line with Nigeria's policy 
of 
making Africa the centre-piece of its foreign policy as well as 
with the objectives of the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) and the Organisation of African Unity. 
"Equally, it will foster the attainment of mutual collective 
security system for the defence of the West African sub-region, 
in particular, and the continent of Africa in general," he said. 
  Cumba said his country requested the military assistance as 
part of its efforts to battle rebels in its eastern border 
areas. Nigeria sent troops to Sierra Leone last year to help the 
government battle a rebel offensive.

  [Text] Nigeria's external debt payment arrears stood at 
$4.534 billion as at the end of October last year. The minister 
of finance, Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu, said during the 1994 budget 
breakdown in Abuja that the arrears included $25.72 million due 
for payment to the European International Bank. Under a Paris 
Club reschedulement arrangement, the country recorded $1.55 
billion in debt payment arrears in the medium term. He said 
short-term public sector arrears amounted to $105.12 million 
while short-term private sector arrears totalled $1.119 billion. 
Dr. Kalu said the arrears of external debt payments under the 
Paris bilateral arrangement stood at $16.439 million. Arrears 
of external debt payments to non-Paris bilateral creditors, 
including the former USSR and South Korea, amounted to $533.655 
million. Other nonpreviously consolidated debts which matured 
between 1 April 1992 and December 1993 totalled $838 million. 
Nigeria did not, however, record external debt payment arrears 
to the London Club as at 31 October 1993.

  [Text] Dakar, 12 Jan (AFP) -- Senegalese Economy and 
Finance Minister Pape Ousmane Sakho has announced a 10 percent 
salary increase in three months' time to mitigate the negative 
effects of the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc which was 
decided yesterday evening. Mr. Sakho, who was answering 
questions put to him by Radio Senegal reporters, said the 
emergency plan adopted by Senegal in August last year to remove 
the major imbalances in public finances will be maintained with 
some modifications. With this plan, salaries were reduced by 15 
percent in the public sector thus lowering civil service 
salaries from 2.6 billion French francs to less than Fr1.8 
billion . 
  The emergency plan is "unavoidable" and will "support the 
external adjustment" necessitated by the CFA franc devaluation, 
the minister said. He also announced the establishment of a 
future plan to limit inflation on essential commodities like 
rice, sugar, and flour. According to Mr. Sakho, the inflation 
rate envisaged for the first year after the devaluation is 40 
percent. The ultimate objective is to reduce this inflation 
rate to 10 percent in the second year.

  [Text] Government troops this morning scored spectacular 
victories over rebels in both the Kenema and Kailahun districts. 
According to a communique issued by the Defense Department, 
government troops this morning recaptured Kobu, Kokoru, Jawe, 
and Geleblama in the Kenema axes. Defense officials say the 
capture of the towns has now reopened the road from Jolu to Zimi 
to commuter traffic. 
  Also this morning government troops swept through Kongoma, 
Bowo, Baoma, Jaluahun, and Kayima in the Kailahun District in 
rapid succession. At Bowo, seven rebels were killed after a 
two-hour battle, while two officials of the RUF [Revolutionary 
United Front], Lieutenant Kosia, a renegade soldier, who was the 
rebels' director of training, and Philip Kpulum were captured. 
  To celebrate the triumph of government troops, the 
undersecretary of state for defense, Captain Komba Kambo, has 
dispatched a message of congratulations on behalf of the 
chairman of the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council] and 
head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser, to the commanders of 
the 3d and 4th Battalions. The message commended the gallantry, 
bravery, and endurance of the troops in prosecuting the rebel 
war.

  [Excerpts] Some light might soon be shed on the recent 
bloody events in Togo. A Togolese woman has made a statement 
that might turn out to be a decisive factor. From Lome, Olabire 
da Cruz has the details: 
  [Begin Da Cruz recording] An employee of the West African 
Development Bank, Mrs. Kponton nee Ajavon was shown on 
television last night and during the interview, she said that 
her house was adjacent to the one where the assailants had put 
up few days before the attack. One of the perpetrators was her 
neighbor, a man named Eugene Kouvaye, a friend of her husband, 
Mr. Ernest Kponton. [passage omitted] 
  After weapons were found in his home yesterday, Mr. Kponton, 
who is an architect, is under serious suspicion. According to 
his wife, Mr. Kponton had close relations with one of the 
perpetrators of the 5 January attack. [end recording] 
  Here now is the reaction of Mr. Adan Messan Ajavon, 
secretary 
general of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] who said there 
should be no link between individual responsibilities of Mr. 
Ernest Kponton and the party's responsibility. He made this 
clarification after the news conference given in Lome by UTD 
Chairman Edem Kodjo. Let us listen to UTD Secretary General Adan 
Messan Ajavon talking on the phone to our correspondent 
Jean-Claude Frank Mendome: 
  [Begin Ajavon recording] Mr. Ernest Kponton is not the 
number 
two man or the vice president of the UTD. The UTD affirms that 
nobody is above the law and that concerning the serious events 
that happened in our country, the government must carry out 
investigations in conformity with the law in order to find the 
culprits. Indeed, under Article 18 of the 1992 Togolese 
Constitution, any accused person is deemed innocent until found 
guilty following a trial that must provide necessary guarantees 
for his defense. The UTD is astonished that at the present 
stage of the preliminary investigations, this notion of 
innocence has not been applied to Mr. Ernest Kponton. He has 
been found guilty even before the conclusion of the 
investigations. 
  However, the UTD makes it a point that all possible light 
should be shed on this affair and proposes that the diplomatic 
corps and the international monitoring committee should assist 
in ensuring that Mr. Kponton is heard by the competent Togolese 
authorities under conditions stipulated by law. Also, the UTD 
notes that in the presentation of the facts, attempts have been 
made to involve not only Mr. Kponton, but his party as well. 
The UTD condemns this state of affairs which tends to link 
individual responsibilities and collective responsibilities, 
contrary to the elementary principles of the law. [end

  [Text] Durban Jan 12 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] should consider ending negotiations with the African 
National Congress [ANC] and the South African Government in 
favour of "opposition politics", its leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
said on Wednesday. "I see no reason for our negotiating teams 
to continue to sit around tables for a month-and-a-half 
restating over and over things which we have discussed ad 
nauseam since July 2, 1993." 
  Mr Buthelezi did not spell out what his idea of opposition 
politics was, although he briefly referred to mobilising against 
elections. He was addressing a kwaZulu legislative assembly 
caucus in ulundi in his capacity as chief minister. "I believe 
it is time for us to move from a reactive to a proactive mode 
and to develop our own political initiative." 
  He said the IFP and kwaZulu government faced two choices: 
"either we continue to negotiate with the ANC for another 
month-and-a-half...or we call their bluff now and we say enough 
is enough." By opting for the first alternative, Mr Buthelezi 
said, precious political time would be wasted. 
  By pulling out of talks, the IFP and kwaZulu would gain the 
time needed to develop "political alternatives and bring to the 
country a clear message of opposition". 
  The IFP president reiterated his "total commitment" to a 
negotiated constitutional settlement but said the government and 
ANC had "our balls in their court (sic)". The IFP and kwaZulu's 
demands were minimal and it was up to the ANC to indicate 
whether or not it wanted to discuss them. 
  Mr Buthelezi accused the ANC of negotiating merely to 
manoeuvre itself into a position from which it could avoid any 
substantive discussions on the IFP and kwaZulu's amendments to 
the constitution. 
  "Their major political goal is to ensure that they can drag 
us along with the process after the date of elections. By doing 
so, they can reduce the strength and the effect of our 
opposition politics and ensure that we can not mobilise against 
elections if we choose to do so."

  [Text] Durban Jan 12 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] on Wednesday described a meeting between State President F 
W de Klerk and African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson 
Mandela on Tuesday as window-dressing. "The nationalist 
government and its intelligence and security agencies seem 
fixated on the right wing and the Pan Africanist Congress, while 
they ignore far more serious violence orchestrated by the ANC 
against opponents in the black community," IFP spokesman Dr Ziba 
Jiyane said in a statement from Durban. 
  He added that any attempt to address violence without taking 
into account the ANC's role as "a primary player" or excluding 
other important players was doomed to failure. "The meeting in 
Pretoria...has no significance at all, except as glitzy window- 
dressing," said Dr Jiyane. 
  The meeting was clearly meant to create an impression of 
impartial government and ANC concern about violence, while 
sanitising one party's role in it, he concluded.

[IFP] on Thursday disassociated itself from a call by its 
Johannesburg Chairman Humphrey Ndlovu for Zulus to stay away 
from work on Monday when king Goodwill Zwelithini meets 
President F W de Klerk in Pretoria. 
  In a statement, IFP Political Director Dr. Ziba Jiyane said: 
"The IFP disassociates itself from the statements by certain IFP 
members implying that the IFP has called for a worker stay-away 
on Monday, January 17. "Since the January 17 event is being 
organised by the Zulu king and not the IFP, the IFP could not 
have made any such decision. We wish to emphasise the meeting 
on Monday between his majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini and State 
President F W de Klerk has absolutely nothing to do with the 
IFP," Dr. Jiyane said. 
  Mr Ndlovu made the initial stay-away call in a statement on 
Wednesday night. He declined to elaborate. 
  IFP Transvaal leader and Central Committee member Themba 
Khoza confirmed on Wednesday night the party would call on Zulus 
to stay away from work on Monday. He said the official call 
would be made in a statement on Thursday. Mr Khoza said IFP 
supporters in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
region were expected to mass outside the Union Buildings in 
Pretoria on Monday when the Zulu monarch met Mr de Klerk. 
  The IFP has called a press conference in Johannesburg later 
on Thursday to clarify the IFP's position on the stay-away call. 
The confusion comes amid persistent claims by IFP rivals that 
the party is using King Zwelithini for political gain.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 13 SAPA -- Chief negotiators from 
the government, African National Congress [ANC] and Freedom 
Alliance [FA] will meet in the next few days to try to arrange 
full-blown trilateral talks. Roelf Meyer, Cyril Ramaphosa and 
Rowan Cronje will meet informally to explore whether the 
political impasse with the Freedom Alliance can be broken. 
  Two rounds of trilateral talks at the end of last year ended 
with alliance negotiators agreeing to take a proposal to their 
leaders that would pave the way for further talks. It also 
addressed the commitment required by the government and the ANC 
before they are prepared to discuss the changes to the 
constitution demanded by the Freedom Alliance. 
  The three sides gave themselves until January 24 to broker 
an 
inclusive political deal. An apparent lack of movement by the 
alliance and signs of "reluctance" on the part of the ANC to 
resume negotiations since the last round had made it more 
difficult to arrange further talks, a government spokesman said 
on Thursday. "It is a tense and difficult situation to 
overcome," he conceded. 
  The alliance was still committed to further trilateral 
talks, 
Mr Cronje said on Thursday. However, he warned the government 
and the ANC to stop "playing with words". He said the alliance 
welcomed the latest statements from the government and ANC 
committing themselves to an inclusive settlement, but there were 
fears the two sides were "stringing the FA along". 
  It appeared some elements within the government and the ANC 
were not keen to re-open the interim constitutional package. 
"Let's stop putting obstacles in the way. Let us know where we 
stand," the alliance chairman pleaded. He dismissed the tough 
stance taken recently by some alliance members who believe the 
government and the ANC to be dragging their feet. He also 
dismissed as "nonsense" speculation that cracks had appeared 
within the alliance, following Ciskei's decision to participate 
in the Transitional Executive Council.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 13 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela on Thursday accused 
government of complicity in township violence and creating 
problems among ANC- aligned Self-Defence Units [SDU]. 
  Mr. Mandela said the ANC had disciplined some SDU members 
involved in violence. He was speaking after a meeting of 
Patriotic Front members and responding to radio and newspaper 
reports which quoted an East Rand SDU member as saying he killed 
opponents as he would kill chickens. The SDU issue would be 
raised at Friday's meeting of the ANC national executive 
committee, Mr Mandela said. However, he said he wanted to 
stress, without being protective of SDUs, that problems with the 
units were the results of a government strategy. 
  "Their strategy is based on the fact that they will have 
overwhelming suport among whites in the election. They are 
confident of substantial support among coloreds and Indians, and 
that the base of the ANC is the African community. The violence 
is taking place only among Africans. By instigating and 
conniving in the violence they will be able to cut down the 
majority of the ANC." 
  The ANC, he said, did not condone the lack of discipline and 
slaughter of innocent people. Mr Mandela said peace-keeping 
proposals he discussed with State President F. W. de Klerk on 
Monday dovetailed with the efforts of the Transitional Executive 
Council. Mr Mandela said he would report to the ANC national 
executive committee on his discussions with Mr de Klerk.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 13 SAPA -- Political leaders 
aligned to the African National Congress [ANC]-led Patriotic 
Front [PF] met in Johannesburg on Thursday to formulate a joint 
election strategy. 
  The PF leaders included ANC President Nelson Mandela, Labour 
Party leader Allan Hendrickse, Transvaal Indian Congress 
representative Cassim Saloojee and the leaders of Lebowa, Venda, 
Transkei and kwaNdebele. PF co-ordinator Ismael Ibrahim said 
the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the April 27 elections 
and the PF's campaign. 
  Mr Mandela, reacting before the meeting to Inkatha Freedom 
Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's threat to oppose the 
election process, said that while the ANC and the National Party 
were the major players, they were not the only ones. "Our 
desire is to persuade all political parties to come along with 
us in the process." 
  Mr Mandela disclosed that he held talks on Wednesday with a 
"major personality" to broaden the inclusivity of the process. 
He did not name the person and asked the media not to probe for 
details. He said it would be regrettable if any political 
parties turned their backs on the negotiations process.

  [Text] Durban Jan 12 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] said on Wednesday it was baffled by the Transitional 
Executive Council's [TEC] claim that the level of violence had 
dropped in kwaZulu since more members of the SA Police's [SAP] 
Internal Stability Division [ISD] were sent there last month, 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. 
  IFP spokesman Senzo Mfayela said joint policing by the 
kwaZulu police and the South African Police was the result of 
bilateral understandings between the two forces -- not as a 
result of TEC instructions. 
  He said there had been no visible decline in violence in 
flashpoint areas policed exclusively by the SAP in Natal. 
  Mr Mfayela said it was ironic that the TEC favoured the 
intervention of the ISD in kwaZulu areas where the ANC [African 
National Congress] had little following, while the ANC 
simultaneously campaigned for the ISD's withdrawal from areas it 
believed it had a chance of dominating.

  [Text] The Law and Order Ministry says self-defense units 
[SDU] will have to be disbanded and killers within their ranks 
brought to justice. Ministry spokesman Captain Craig Kotze says 
this will be part of ensuring free and fair elections on the 
East Rand. Kotze has been reacting to newspaper and radio 
reports quoting an East Rand SDU member who said killing 
particular people does not worry him. The member, code named 
Tembu, reportedly said when they kill particular people, for him 
it is like he has killed a chicken. He reportedly said this is 
because he sees no reason for people to live if they do not 
understand what the will of the people is. Kotze says the 
statement is a cause for extreme concern. He says it will be 
brought to the attention of the Goldstone Commission: 
  [Begin Kotze recording] Such statements highlight the 
inherently uncontrollable killer instincts of ANC [African 
National Congress] SDU's, and the fact that ANC supporters, and 
not the South African Police as the ANC is fond of claiming, 
play a large role in the East Rand carnage. If free and fair 
elections are to be held on the East Rand in April, it is 
essential that these units be disbanded as quickly as possible 
by the ANC, and that the illegal weapons be handed over to the 
South African Police, and that the killers in their ranks be 
brought to justice as soon as possible. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 12 SAPA -- Residents of East Rand 
townships were overwhelmingly opposed to the presence of police 
Internal Stability Units [ISU] and wanted them withdrawn, 
African National Congress [ANC] spokesman Carl Niehaus said on 
Wednesday. 
  Replying to a question on the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] news programme AGENDA as to why the 
ANC refused police presence in the townships and at the same 
time demanded it, Mr Niehaus denied the ANC had refused to let 
the police perform their duties. 
  He said what the ANC wanted was "proper policing", not 
policing by people who were involving themselves in the violence 
and were unpopular in the townships. "We have heard time and 
again from residents that they don't want the ISUs in the 
townships. Ask anyone and they will give you an unequivocal 
`no' to the presence of these units." 
  Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] National Organiser Maxwell 
Nemadzivhanane said the police worked for an illegitimate regime 
and township residents therefore considered the Transitional 
Executive Council and the ISUs to be illegitimate. 
  He added the police were finding it difficult to maintain 
law 
and order in the townships "simply because they are not 
acceptable there". "As long as we don't have a government 
that's acceptable, they (the police) are illegitimate," he said. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] member Hennie Bekker said the 
IFP 
was against withdrawing the ISUs and said a "small war" was 
going on in Natal. It was "all right to criticise", but the 
units were necessary to prevent further slaughter. 
  Asked whether there had been specific complaints about the 
ISUs, Law and Order Deputy Minister Gert Myburgh said the 
Goldstone Commission had reported that attacks on uniformed 
police were so widespread that the ISUs "had to stay". He said 
the police had investigated many cases, including a number 
against policemen, and did not spare colleagues found guilty of 
offences. 
  Asked about reports that Tanzania had banned violent actions 
by the PAC against South Africa, Mr Nemadzivhanane said Tanzania 
nevertheless remained a strong supporter and was "only asking us 
not to make claims". 
  On allegations of violence and lawlessness committed by self 
defence units, Mr Niehaus said the reasons were complex. The 
ANC was presently restructuring the units and it was hoped they 
would return to their original objectives.

<F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 12 SAPA -- The mining industry 
would have to be revamped to maximise its foreign exchange 
earning and employment creation potential, according to a draft 
African National Congress [ANC] economic policy document 
finalised Wednesday. In addition, the document states the 
country's minerals belong to the nation as a whole and urges a 
reversal of the current private ownership of mineral rights. 
However, this would not be through nationalisation. 
  Speaking at an international executive communications 
conference in Johannesburg, ANC mineral and energy policy 
co-ordinator Paul Jourdan released details of the final draft of 
the reconstruction and development programme [RDP] completed 
Wednesday morning. The RDP put forward as a priority the further 
benefication of the country's minerals in order to boost foreign 
exchange earnings and increase the number of jobs in the mining 
industry. "Exporting raw ore is not benefiting our country in 
terms of employment and in terms of earing forex," Mr Jourdan 
said. 
  The document also recognised industries involved in 
exploiting mineral resources were in long-term decline and an 
effort to move further downstream into fabrication activities 
would help alleviate the inevitable job losses. 
  The RDP suggested the creation of incentives to encourage 
benefication such as a form of royalty payment that was 
dependent upon the further processing of ore. 
  The establishment of a mineral marketing auditing office to 
control transfer pricing is also mooted. 
  "We're thinking of a hit-squad that looks at transfer 
pricing 
of inputs and outputs by companies and takes them to the courts 
if necessary," Mr Jourdan explained. 
  Import-parity pricing by sa mineral producers would be 
scrapped and replaced with less expensive export- or 
profit-parity pricing to benefit domestic fabricators. 
  Underlying the reform of the mining industry, is changing 
the 
pattern of private ownerhsip and control of mineral rights. Mr 
Jourdan said this could involve a tax on mineral rights; 
expropriation on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis; and 
exchange through a system of licenses. He denied this would 
involve nationalisation but admitted it could be perceived as a 
"legislative, sleight-hand" form of nationalisation. 
  In addition, the RDP suggested the creation of a black 
mining 
house through the sale of assets by private mining houses. 
  The two key obstacles to small-scale mining would also be 
removed; namely, the lack of access to mineral rights, and the 
inadequacy of financing and technical support. 
  The RDP document, drawn up by the ANC in conjunction with 
the 
Congress of SA Trade Unions and the SA National Civics 
Organisation, is to be discussed and amended, if necessary, at a 
conference later this month and adopted as official ANC economic 
policy, he said. 
  The full RDP document on the economy is expected to be 
released later Wednesday or Thursday.

<F P=106> [Statement of the ANC Youth League, on its 18th congress to </F>
be held at Vista University 14-17 January, issued by the ANC on 
the SAPA PR wire service] 
  [Text] The 18th congress of the ANC [African National 
Congress] Youth League [ANCYL] will take place at Vista 
University, Soweto, starting on Friday, 14 January 1994 and end 
on Monday 17th January 1994. The congress will be opened by the 
president of the ANC, Nelson Mandela on Friday morning. 
  Congress will also receive reports from the president, 
secretary general and treasurer general of the ANC Youth League. 
The morning session on Friday, namely, the addresses by the 
president of the ANC and the president of the ANC Youth League, 
shall be open to the media and the public in general. The rest 
of congress shall be in closed session, with the exception for 
the closing address by the new president of the ANC Youth League 
which shall be in open session. 
  The closed sessions shall deal with the reports of the 
secretary and treasurer generals and the different commissions 
and their plenary sessions. There will be four commissions 
which shall in turn have sub-commissions. 
  The four commissions are: 
  I. Youth and a democratic South Africa. 
A. The ANCYL post elections. B. The youth and the RDP 
[Restructuring and Development Program]. C. Building a 
national youth council. D. Government participation by youth. 
E. Memorandum on the need for a youth ministry. 
  II. Strategy and tactics 
  III. Constitutional amendments 
  This commission will address the question of the autonomy of 
the ANC Youth League, which will also deal with the general 
relations between the ANC Youth League and the ANc, particularly 
with the ANC being in government 
  IV. Elections and violence 
  Other issues to be dealt with are the ANC Youth League and 
the world youth movement as well as the financial self 
sufficiency of the ANC Youth League. 
  The congress will be attended by 1,550 representatives, 
representing 235,301 paid up members, and an additional 25 
observers that are expected from the international community. 
There will be five (5) youth delegates from each of the camps 
of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] 
that are outside the country. 
  There will also be elections for a new national executive 
committee. Congress is expected to adopt key resolutions on the 
education crisis, the violence, elections, and on organisational 
questions affecting the ANC Youth League. Primary among these 
will be question of establishing branches of the ANC Youth 
League at tertiary learning institutions and schools. The state 
of organisation in the coloured, Indian and white communities 
will also be a subject of discussion. Because the last two 
years have not seen a significant improvement in the 
participation of women in our structures, the challenge to 
ensure greater involvement of young women in the activities of 
the organisation shall occupy a high place in our agenda. 
  The 18th congress should mark a turning point in the history 
of youth politics in South Africa. It shall be the task of our 
congress to ensure that the ambiguous role that has been played 
by the youth since the unbanning of the liberation movement is 
discarded. The congress will have to redefine the role of the 
youth not only in the transition, but also in a post-apartheid 
South Africa.

<F P=106> [Phone-in question and answer session with Pan Africanist </F>
Congress Relief Aid Secretary and negotiator Patricia de Lille 
by SABC presenters David Hall-Green and Chante Hinds on the GMSA 
program; italicized passages in Afrikaans -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Hall-Green] And good morning to you if you have 
joined us and you are on Good Morning South Africa [GMSA] on the 
big one, and the time is 20 past seven o'clock, and it being 
Wednesday of course, it's time for our political personality to 
be featured and this time the turn of the Pan Africanist 
Congress. And we have with us this morning Mrs. Patricia de 
Lille who is a member of the Executive Committee of that 
organization. And we are going to be opening the phone lines 
later on and we'll give you the number. Good morning Mrs. de 
Lille. 
  [De Lille] Good morning, David. 
  [Hall-Green] Many people would say that in the light of the 
way that things are going with the break down of apartheid and 
the general improvement in our society and the steps that have 
been taken, that the PAC is being more militant than necessary. 
What would be your answer to that allegation? 
  [De Lille] Well, if the truth means that we are militant, 
then that is correct, because we've always and consistently 
propagated the truth to our people. We have not tried to divert 
the attention from the main problems facing our country. And if 
people say we are militant because of that it's because we 
propagate the truth. 
  [Hall-Green] But what I'm saying is that you are said to be 
more militant than is actually necessary, the steps that you're 
taking. 
  [De Lille] Well, you know I don't know how they measure it, 
what criteria they use to say that we are more militant. But I 
accept that there is a perception that the PAC is more militant. 
This is being created by the media, by the electronic media, the 
printed media and so on. Our members, because they are young 
and vibrant, and because they are angry, they are frustrated, 
the only way of showing their feelings is by action, because 
they've got no democratically elected representatives in 
Parliament that they can use to air their grievances. 
  [Hinds]Patricia, on that note, what is your view about 
the violence taking place in the townships? How do you feel 
about it? 
  [De Lille]Every person who gets killed today in our 
country, every person who dies at the hands of violence -- it is 
unacceptable to the PAC. We feel that not enough is being done 
to end the violence. The time has come to stop pointing fingers 
as to who is responsible for the violence. We must say the 
violence must stop. At the moment one organization blames the 
other and that has been the trend over the last three years. 
  [Hall-Green] What about attacks such as that on the 
Heidelberg tavern in Cape Town? 
  [De Lille] The Heidelberg attack in Cape Town -- the police 
are still busy with their investigations, thereafter I suppose 
they will charge people. After they have charged them 
officially they will then have to appear in a court of law, and 
it's only then that we can comment and say who is responsible 
and who is guilty in that particular case. At the moment it's 
all sub judice and investigations are still going on. 
  [Hall-Green] Does the PAC disassociate themselves entirely 
from that attack on the Heidelberg? 
  [De Lille] The PAC, our deputy president Johnson Mlambo, has 
disassociated the PAC from the attack on New Year's Eve. I 
personally had condemned all violence throughout the country 
irrespective of whether it's in Cape Town, in Natal, or in the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area. 
  [Hall-Green] What about control or not controlling the 
military wing APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]? 
  [De Lille] That is more than a question of controlling or 
not 
controlling, that is again something that's being... [pauses] a 
perception which is being carried in the media. We have no 
control over APLA. APLA is the military wing of the PAC. They 
are accountable to the mother body, the PAC as much as the 
political leadership of the PAC is accountable to the mother 
body. 
  [Hinds]You mentioned just now that violence is 
unacceptable, but has the PAC ever adopted that view and 
discouraged violence in the black townships? 
  [De Lille] The PAC is not involved in the internecine 
violence in our townships. The PAC has in the past, and we are 
still trying to act as a mediator between the various parties. 
I challenge anybody in the country to point out where the PAC 
is actually responsible for violence within the townships. The 
violence itself is not acceptable to all of us in the country. 
If there are other means of achieving your political objectives 
that should have first priority before thinking of taking up a 
gun, being intolerant and eliminate your political opponent. 
  [Hall-Green] We're going to open the phone line. If you 
would like to phone in with a specific question for Mrs. 
Patricia de Lille please do so from now, and the telephone 
number is the same from wherever you are phoning in the country. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Hall-Green] Mrs. de Lille, what's the story now with 
Tanzania? We read that the Tanzanian Government are banning any 
political activity of the PAC in exile in Tanzania. What is 
actually the story. There seems to be quite a bit of 
contradiction in the reports. 
  [De Lille] Well, as far as I know, David, that we did 
receive 
a note from the Tanzanian Government. This is a diplomatic 
issue which we want to confirm that we did receive such a 
letter, and the PAC will attend to that in due course. 
  [Hall-Green] But does it seem likely that it's going to 
severely curtail the operations of the organization? 
  [De Lille] I must first of all say the Tanzanian Government 
is one of the few governments in the continent which has always 
shone out amongst the others as far as assistance and support 
for the liberation movements are concerned. It's very unlikely 
that they will just all of a sudden stop that support for the 
liberation movements. So once we have more clarity about the 
content of the letter the PAC will respond. 
  [Hall-Green] As we move further and further into the 
so-called new South Africa, it would seem that physical monetary 
support -- financial support -- for the PAC is diminishing. Is 
this going to mean that the organization is going to have to 
change its identity from that of a liberation organization to 
become more of a conventional political party in order to 
survive? 
  [De Lille] Let me first say that we've never in the PAC 
relied solely on international funding... 
  [Hall-Green, interrupting] But you've had considerable 
support. 
  [De Lille] Yes, we've had support from them, but at the same 
time we've also cultivated a culture of self-reliance among our 
people. So we are quite well placed to continue with our self- 
reliance program. It will most probably affect the PAC 
adversely to an extent only. As far as the question whether we 
are going to contest the election as a liberation movement or as 
a political party, we have to register as a political party to 
contest the elections, and we will do so very, very soon. 
  [Hinds] We have our first caller on the line. It's Joe from 
Cape Town. Good morning. 
  [Joe] Good morning lady, good morning Mrs. de Lille. I would 
just like to ask one question. Why is it that the media is 
making a fuss of the Heidelberg tavern, and let's go back 
quickly to the Amy Biehl case. They made a fuss about the Amy 
Biehl case when they, the regime -- the illegitimate regime -- 
have killed a 13-year-old boy, Sam Siphuwo, in Guguletu the 
world did not cry out. If you can just tell me why is it that 
the media don't see the one side of the story, but they see the 
other side of the story? 
  [De Lille] I think partly that question needs to be put to 
the media, but I must agree with you that there is a hypocrisy 
in the way of response by the media on various issues. And I 
hope that now that we are moving to a free and fair election, we 
are moving to a stage whereby we want to level the playing 
fields effectively amongst the political parties. So this kind 
of reaction by the media must come to an end. But the question 
is best put to the media themselves. 
  [Hall-Green] And the next caller Robbie Roberts. Good 
morning to you, Sir. 
  [Roberts] My question to Patricia de Lille is would she be 
willing to go to the United States and tell the Americans that 
they must give all land back to the Indians, and do the same in 
Australia, go to Australia and tell them they must give the land 
back to the aborigines, and in all other places that were 
colonized a couple of hundred centuries ago, because she's often 
said that all land must be given back to the blacks. First of 
all, the land never belonged to them -- there was nobody here. 
And I would just like to know if she would be willing to go and 
campaign for those kind of things to happen in America and 
Australia and if that happens. I'm sure the whites here won't 
mind giving all the land back. 
  [De Lille] Mr. Roberts, I think you have to study your 
history books, and history books not written by the African 
people of this country but by people who came here in 1652. 
This country has been colonized, that is a fact of life. 
There's nobody that can dispute it. And what we've 
consistently said in the PAC was to call for the return of the 
land to the original owners. There's no such thing that there 
was nobody. When Jan van Riebeeck first put foot here on this 
continent, he was received very well. In fact, his whole boat 
was supplied with fresh produce and he could sail further. So 
for you to say there was nobody here is absolutely incorrect. 
I'll advise you to study your history books written by the 
people of this country. Thank you. [passage omitted] 
  [Hall-Green] Mrs. de Lille, before our next question comes 
through, let's just get further clarification on this business 
of APLA. I think many people find it very difficult to believe 
that the military wing of an organization can operate apparently 
independently and with absolute impunity and not be controlled 
by the mother organization. 
  [De Lille] No David, that is not correct. I know it's a 
perception, and I want to deal with those perceptions. It is 
not correct to say that. The PAC as early as June of 1993 has 
accepted the principle of mutual cessation of hostilities. You 
must understand that if you are in a war situation there must be 
two parties involved. We have then said further that we are 
prepared to discuss the implementation of that principle, and 
that agreement that we have with the regime. And at the moment 
that meetings [as heard] cannot take place because for one 
reason or the other they find some excuses not to meet with the 
PAC. And we went further to say that while the talks are in 
progress then we will place a moratorium so there won't be 
attacks from both sides. But we are not making war against 
ourselves. The war out there is between two parties, and I 
think that the other side of the parties that are involved in 
the war -- they are not looked at. They have been responsible 
for, I mean [changes thought]. The security forces in this 
country have been responsible for many killings. We have lost 
more than 10,000 African people since 1990. 
  [Hall-Green] But now are you going to be prepared to say 
right now as you sit there that the PAC at this stage does not 
know whether or not the St. James Church massacre or the 
Heidelberg tavern were perpetrated by people belonging to APLA? 
  [De Lille] It is not only the PAC that did not know. It is 
the whole country. 
  [Hall-Green] You're saying you don't know. The PAC does not 
know? 
  [De Lille, interrupting] The whole country, David, until 
such 
time a person has been charged and tried in a court of law, then 
we can for sure say. At the moment the police are still busy 
with investigations in the St. James attack, the Heidelberg 
attack and they must still conclude their investigation. 
  [Hall-Green] So you don't know whether those were your 
people 
or not? 
  [De Lille] We don't know if our people are guilty, but we do 
know that certain people have been arrested as suspects in this 
case and they are members of the PAC. [passage omitted] 
  [Hinds]Regarding the forthcoming election in April, 
where does the PAC stand regarding participation? 
  [De Lille]The PAC's congress recently in Umtata in 
December last year decided that the PAC is to take part in the 
election, and we are busy preparing for that. 
  [Hinds]Let's talk to (Philip Mphahlela) of 
Johannesburg.Please go ahead. 
  [Mphahlela] I would like to ask De Lille why [pauses] When 
they started the story they said that the PAC is too militant. 
Really, most of the people are disappointed because after they 
killed that school girl in Guguletu or Khayelitsha there was 
toyi-toying [protest dancing] at court every now and then. Is 
it not to the disappointment of most of the people when this 
happened? Why couldn't they apologize to the family publicly 
because it is the young PAC's who have done this. Thank you. 
  [De Lille] Again Philip, your information is not correct. 
Again your information is based on what has been so far 
projected in the media. Legal investigations are still even 
continuing as far as that is concerned. Nobody so far has been 
found guilty and sentenced for the particular crimes you are 
referring to. So it is premature to say that we are responsible 
for those attacks. Thank you. 
  [Hall-Green] Is this not another indication of ignorance of 
what certain elements operating under the banner of the PAC are 
actually up to? 
  [De Lille] It's deliberate ignorance on the part of those 
who 
want to discredit the PAC. It's a deliberate attempt on the 
part of those people who want to demonize the PAC. As far as we 
are concerned there is no deliberate attempt by the PAC to say 
look, we are not responsible or we are responsible. It is other 
people who have a problem. We don't have a problem. 
  [Hall-Green] You have a problem of bad publicity at the 
moment, rightly or wrongly, and whoever is generating this, you 
allege that the media are reporting inaccurately and that there 
is some kind of campaign, but you do have the problem of bad 
publicity. You have a bad press. 
  [De Lille] Well, the PAC, David, you must understand, has 
not 
been built by the media and we will not be destroyed by the 
media. But people that we represent are the 75 percent 
functionately [as heard] illiterate people in this country who 
don't even have access to a newspaper, who don't even have 
access to a TV, and they hardly come to hear about all these bad 
things they are saying about the PAC. Of course the liberal 
press have got their own interest. They must print news that 
their backers would like to see in the newspapers, and we can't 
intervene. They still have the right to print what they want to 
print. [Hinds] (Bongani Linde) from Orlando east. [Linde] 
Good morning. I would like to speak to the lady from the PAC. 
  [Hinds] Please go ahead. 
  [Linde] I'm not a member of the PAC, but I would like to say 
to you Madam, all the African people here are behind you. We 
are definitely supporting the PAC, but the only thing we are 
totally opposed is bloodshed which we do not know as yet whether 
it comes from the PAC leadership. But all I would like to say 
is continue with the struggle, take it forward, and please stop 
theorizing a lot and start becoming practical and getting 
straight to the people on the ground and mobilizing us. Thank 
you. 
  [De Lille] Thank you Bongani. 
  [Hinds] It seems like the violence is an issue all over. 
Would you be addressing that pertinently? 
  [De Lille] As I've said in the past, we've made attempts and 
we are still making attempts. Our members are caught in the 
cross fire of the internecine violence between Inkatha and the 
ANC in the townships and in Natal. We have on several occasions 
offered our services, our good officers, of our president to 
mediate between the two parties. We only received a favorable 
response from Inkatha and we are still pursuing that, although 
the ANC has turned our offer down for our president to mediate. 
  [Hall-Green] Why do you think they have turned your offer 
down? 
  [De Lille] They have accused us of being opportunists. I 
don't think you can be opportunist if you're concerned about the 
dying and the killing of African people, and they have never 
really come out with a clear answer except to say we are 
opportunists. 
  [Hall-Green] Next caller on the line is Brenda Wardle from 
Sandown in the Transvaal -- in Sandton. Good morning Brenda. 
  [Wardle] Good morning. Patricia, don't APLA, your armed 
wing, embark on these violent attacks now -- here I'm referring 
to those for which they are responsible -- as a means of 
struggle or actually as a token of disrespect for human lives. 
Now I ask this because of the toyi-toying [protest dancing] 
that took place outside the courtroom during the Amy Biehl 
murder trial, and does the PAC actually realize that there are 
some blacks who want to mislead our people into deeper 
oppression, for example the Buthelezis and some white people who 
are genuinely devoted to the struggle for example, the Joe 
Slovos of this world. South Africa is basically not just 
divided into good blacks and bad settlers, and I hope that you 
people will realize that. Thank you very much. 
  [De Lille] Brenda, may I just say that if you know the 
history of the PAC and the history of the liberation movement, 
in the early 60's when there were no other channels open for 
them to pursue a peaceful change in this country, out of 
desperation and out of concern of getting the liberation and the 
freedom of our people, the movements resorted to the armed 
struggle. We in the PAC has [as heard] always believed that 
there's no ways that anybody can dictate to us what methods to 
use to free ourselves. The desperation and the dying and the 
maiming of our people calls for anything that, you know, you can 
use to free our people. We have, as the PAC, accepted the line 
of negotiations and we've not said that negotiations will be the 
only form of struggle that will bring liberation to this 
country. We've not made a revolution at the World Trade Center. 
But rather the various forms of struggle complement each other, 
and when they realize that there is a possibility that we might 
overthrow the existing regime through the ballot box, we then 
agreed to mutual cessation of hostilities early in June already. 
Thank you. 
  [Hinds]From Bloemfontein, another caller. Mrs. Blom, 
good morning. 
  [Blom]Good morning. I have a question for Mrs. de 
Lille. I remember a meeting she had with Dr. Allan Boesak in 
the Cape where she said among others: The white people have 
taken our country. Now we are just wondering, could she tell us 
what her origins are. Is she not also, in quotation marks, a 
settler? Thank you very much. 
  [De Lille]What I said in Cape Town was quite correct, 
but all I can tell you is that I am a example of colonialism 
because my surname is of French origin, but if no French had 
come to this country then where does the surname come from? 
Many of our people have German surnames, have Spanish surnames. 
Now where do those surnames come from? It is proof that at one 
stage or another in our history there were people who did not 
have their roots in Africa. Thank you. 
  [Hall-Green] You know, I think that many people's obvious 
question in their minds and on their lips sitting at home 
watching this right now is: If it were not for the so-called 
settlers, that large general grouping that you make, what would 
have become of this country? Would this country be the country 
that it is today? Is it not to all of our advantage ultimately 
in the long run that there were settlers, that there was the 
know-how brought in from the northern hemisphere to create the 
South Africa of today? We certainly wouldn't have been here 
today had it not been for settlers. 
  [De Lille] I totally disagree with you David on this one. 
After all the people who used their hands, the workers of this 
land, it is them who are responsible for building up this 
country, it is them who... 
  [Hall-Green, interrupting] In conjunction surely with the 
settlers. 
  [De Lille] In conjunction, but in most cases they were in a 
supervising position. Even today just go down the street and 
you find a white person sitting in a truck, just sitting the 
whole day, and you find eight or nine African people slaving it 
away. But at the end of the day the rewards for the African 
people and the rewards for the white person who is sitting the 
whole day -- the contrast, the difference is so big. So it's 
incorrect to say that you can come with your knowledge, but if 
you came with knowledge, you still had to have programs and you 
still had to have hands for the programs to be implemented. So 
it's not fair to say that because you came with knowledge, it's 
because of the knowledge. 
  [Hinds]But that's a situation which is fast changing 
surely. Do you admit that? 
  [De Lille] I cannot. The changes you refer to [pauses] the 
people who we represent, to them changes mean having a house, a 
roof over their heads, that they have access to job 
opportunities, and so on. And the so-called changes that you 
are referring to are at the moment -- they are not being felt by 
the ordinary person in the street. We are still looking for the 
so- called new South Africa. We do not know where it is. We 
are trying to find it. We are still looking for the cemetery 
where they bury apartheid and you cannot find it. I am talking 
on behalf of the ordinary man and woman in the street, the 
so-called changes we still have to see. [passage omitted] 
  [Hall-Green] That's about it for this particular discussion, 
and we say our thanks to Patricia de Lille. Before you go, I 
want to ask you please once more to answer us a yes or no answer 
regarding the knowledge that the PAC has of the actions of APLA. 
Can you say that you do not know that APLA is in fact operating 
completely independently of the mother organization? 
  [De Lille] Let me say David, I'm under no obligation to say 
yes or no because the answer is not that simple. I was at pains 
earlier on to explain what is the situation. It seems then that 
you have accepted like many other people in the country a trial 
in the media. We've been sentenced and found guilty... 
  [Hall-Green, interrupting] Personally I have a totally open 
mind on this, that's why I asked you the question. 
  [De Lille] You know, it's not as simple like that. I'm under 
no obligation to answer that, thank you. 
  [Hall-Green] Thank you Patricia de Lille, thank you for 
being 
with us this morning.

  [Text] The South African Police [SAP] has turned down a PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] request for a joint investigation into 
the police raid on a PAC meeting in the Cape last week. A 
teenage boy was killed when police opened fire on the crowd 
which they say had stoned officers. The PAC had called for a 
joint inquiry into police behavior during the raid, but reports 
say police have sent a message to the organization's lawyer 
saying no legal provision exists for a joint investigation. The 
SAP says only peace officers can obtain statements, and that 
other factors such as privilege and sub judice rule have to be 
considered.

  [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has dismissed a 
newspaper report that the organization has come under fire from 
Zimbabwe for its violent acts in South Africa. THE HERALD is 
the African country's biggest daily newspaper and often reflects 
the thinking of President Robert Mugabe's government. An 
editorial in the paper warns that other African states may 
follow Tanzania's lead. Tanzania this week barred the PAC from 
using its Dar es Salaam headquarters as a launching pad for 
violent attacks against South Africa. PAC official Gora Ebrahim 
says the report is part of a continuing campaign to discredit 
the organization. 
  [Begin Ebrahim recording] This is totally unfounded. The 
relationship between the government and the Pan-Africanist 
Congress, the government and ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National 
Union -- Patriotic Front] remain as solid as ever. We have 
received no written letter or indication whatsoever. In fact, 
recently our deputy president led a delegation to the Frontline 
States meeting where the position of the PAC on various issues 
was clearly put before the chairman of the Frontline States, who 
is His Excellency President Robert Mugabe. [end recording] 
  Ebrahim also says that the PAC is not surprised that the 
South African Police [SAP] is refusing to conduct a joint 
investigation into the Gugulethu shooting. A 13-year-old boy 
was shot dead when police raided a PAC meeting in the Cape 
township last week. The PAC had called for a joint inquiry but 
the SAP says no legal provision exists for it to conduct a joint 
investigation. Ebrahim says police are scared of being exposed. 
  [Begin Ebrahim recording] On each occasion that the PAC has 
been asking for a thorough investigation into these attempts, 
none of these have been taken up by the regime. It means that 
it is guilty of the crime and it is refusing to be accountable 
for it. [end recording] 
  That's PAC official Gora Ebrahim. Cape Town police, 
meanwhile, have suspended the officer who allegedly shot the 
teenage boy, pending an investigation. The inquiry is being 
headed by Colonel Johan Kleyn.

  [Text] United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has proposed that nearly 1,800 UN civilian observers should help 
monitor the country's April election. In a written report to 
the security council Butrus Ghali says the observers will form 
the largest contingent of an international observer group of 
2,840. 
  The group will also include 50 observers from the 
Organization of African Unity, 322 from the European Union, 70 
from the Commonwealth and about 600 from individual countries 
and the diplomatic community. They will all be coordinated by 
the UN. Butrus-Ghali says, however, the total of election 
monitors is likely to exceed 5,000. This is counting observers 
likely to be sent by foreign nongovernmental organizations. He 
did not give the cost of the UN operation, but diplomats say it 
is estimated at around $40 million.

  [Text] Parties have disputed a poll by the Human Sciences 
Research Council [HSRC] on the outcome of the election. A poll 
by the HSRC and the Multiparty Democracy Organization found that 
the ANC [African National Congress] would obtain a two thirds 
majority. 
  The ANC does not think it will get a two thirds majority, 
but 
thinks it will win an outright majority. It has criticized the 
poll, saying the category of people who did not know which party 
they would vote for had not been taken into consideration, nor 
were the residents of the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, 
Ciskei] states. 
  The National Party also criticized the poll finding, saying 
it believes its support is increasing compared with parties such 
as the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], the CP [Conservative Party], 
and other parties in the Freedom Alliance in general. 
  Meanwhile, the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] says the 
fact that it and the Conservative Party can show that they have 
2 million supporters should provide food for thought. It says 
groups wanting to ignore the Afrikaner's demand for 
self-determination should not ignore that support.

  [Text] The future of Radio Pretoria still lies in the hands 
of the minister of home affairs, Mr. Danie Schutte. This 
follows the postponement of a date for legislation to be 
introduced by the Transitional Executive Council on establishing 
the Independent Broadcasting Authority, to allow for the 
submission of more nominations to the body. Mr. Schutte said 
earlier that the broadcasting authority would have to decide on 
a license for Radio Pretoria. Eleanor Momberg reports: 
  The chairman of Radio Pretoria's management committee, 
Reverend Mossie van den Bergh, says that an urgent application 
was lodged against the minister of home affairs and the 
postmaster general in the Pretoria Supreme Court, in which they 
requested that the radio station be allowed to continue its 
broadcasts. Late yesterday an opposing application was lodged 
in court by the minister and the Postmaster General to prevent 
Radio Pretoria from continuing its broadcasts. The minister of 
home affairs, Mr. Danie Schutte, said yesterday that the radio 
station is contravening the Broadcast Act of 1964 by continuing 
its broadcasts. Reverend van den Bergh says that an agreement 
was reached with government legal representatives, that no 
action would be taken against the station until the court case 
had been completed. He said he regards the legal procedure as 
an application for a temporary broadcast license and added that 
the station would continue broadcasting.

  [Text] South Africa's third right-wing radio station is 
being set up outside Bloemfontein. The station will probably be 
known as Radio Vryheid [Radio Freedom]. The foundations for the 
radio mast were laid this morning by workers supervised by Mr. 
Manie Malan of the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National 
Front]. This will be the second right-wing station in the 
[Orange] Free State. Radio Pretoria has already been operating 
for a while from Donkerhoek, and Radio Koppies [small hills) 
began transmitting about a month ago. 
  Radio Freedom will be received as far afield as Warrington 
in 
the northern Cape, Welkom in the northern Free State, and 
Edenburg in the southern Free State. 
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the management committee of Radio 
Pretoria, the Reverend Mossie van den Berg, has said that there 
is no direct link between Radio Pretoria, Radio Vryheid and 
Radio Koppies. He denied reports that Radio Pretoria was 
broadcasting from another transmitter on the West Rand.

  [Text] South African business leaders are more optimistic 
about South Africa's economic future this year than last year. 
However, almost half of the executive officers of the top 100 
industrial companies expected the political situation in the 
country to deteriorate. The survey conducted by Unisa's 
[University of South Africa] Bureau for Market Research showed 
that business leaders were optimistic that unemployment would 
not rise this year, but would stabilize. They expected the 
economy to grow by just more than one percent this year.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Government, ANC Wait for Freedom Alliance Split -- "The 
government and the ANC [African National Congress] are clearly 
waiting for the Freedom Alliance [FA] to split," notes the page 
6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 12 
January. They also hope the Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP, "will 
break away from the Freedom Alliance to fight the election on 
its own, with the aim of taking over Natal. So far the alliance 
is keeping together, but for how long is uncertain." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Tanzania Message To PAC -- The Tanzanian warning to the Pan- 
Africanist Congress, PAC, to desist from using its territory as 
a base for attacks on South Africa is a significant development 
"because the prohibition extends to the issuing of hostile or 
inflammatory statements by the PAC's Tanzanian office," states a 
page 12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 13 
January. Pressure on the PAC to abandon its armed struggle is 
"starting to mount inexorably." Furthermore, the "cash-strapped 
PAC" must not wilfully misinterpret the meaning of Tanzania's 
message, "or it will find itself cut off from OAU funding." THE 
STAR believes PAC's "Africanist philosophy" has "much to 
contribute to post-apartheid South Africa. But it must first be 
disentangled from the racist sentiments which permeate PAC 
exhortations to kill `settlers'." 
  ANC Excludes Holomisa From Election Lists -- Hugh Roberton 
writes in an article on page 12 of THE STAR that Transkei's 
"military dictator," Bantu Holomisa, "has tacitly latched on to 
the ascending star of the ANC," and the ANC "must believe he is 
worth all the embarrassment and discredit they are inflicting 
upon themselves." In a Holomisa missive to the Transitional 
Executive Council, TEC, there was "an insidious menace 
attendant" on his demands for Transkei. "This is as close as 
Holomisa has come to saying to the ANC: 'if you want me inside 
your tent, pay up'. What is more, the demand-with-threats is 
being made even though Holomisa and the ANC agree that Transkei 
should cease to exist after the April election." However, the 
ANC "has given a hint that it may have seen the light in regard 
to Bantu Holomisa. It has pointedly excluded him from its list 
of election candidates for the Eastern Cape, Border and 
Transkei. This is an encouraging sign, for it would be a sad 
day for the new South Africa if any military bully should 
succeed in getting his way." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Warning Against Tokenism -- The imminent arrivals of a 
mission from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, 
OPIC, and a Canadian trade group are to be welcomed "if they 
lead to greater opportunities for South African exporters and 
manufacturers," begins a page 4 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 January. "OPIC has made it clear 
at the outset that it is interested only in putting U.S. firms 
in touch with our black business community. There is nothing 
wrong with that if it does not imply tokenism. South Africa 
needs to develop more industries that can create jobs that last. 
And that does not depend on the colour of the businessman's 
skin." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  TEC Faces Credibility Test -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English 
on 13 January in a page 8 editorial believes the TEC is facing a 
"credibility test." "It has to address the spiralling violence 
in East Rand townships without being `confrontational' or 
`toothless'. When it met in Pretoria on Tuesday it appointed a 
task force to evaluate the East Rand situation and report back 
next week. Is this not postponing this grave problem by a 
week?" The TEC also "failed to take decisive action against 
kwaZulu Police commissioner Lieutenant General Roy During who 
ignored a TEC resolution to appear before its full sitting to 
answer questions on hit squads in the homeland. Instead, the 
session referred the matter to its management committee to 
'consider action' to force During to appear. This is playing 
marbles while Ulundi prevaricates." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Control Hostels, Disband Self-Defense Units -- "It is time 
that President de Klerk fulfilled his undertaking of September 
1992 and acted effectively to control the hostels," declares 
Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 11 January in a page 6 
editorial. "By the same token Mr Mandela owes it to President 
de Klerk to disband the 'self- defence units' which are 
terrorizing the East Rand. It is no good waiting until the 
National Peacekeeping Force can be deployed in March before 
disbanding these units and disarming them."

  [Text] Prime Minister Tamirat Layne said today that 
Ethiopia, which strives for food self-sufficiency, could benefit 
much from its good relations with the Republic of China on rural 
development and modern agricultural technology. During talks 
with the Chinese foreign minister, Qian Qichen, at his office, 
Prime Minister Tamirat said China, which has long years of 
experience in modern rural agricultural development, could 
certainly share its experience with Ethiopian farmers to change 
their backward system of agricultural production. 
  Prime Minister Tamirat and the Chinese foreign minister 
extensively discussed possible ways of further cementing 
existing bilateral ties between Ethiopia and the Republic of 
China as well as on broadening new areas of economic and 
technical cooperation. Prime Minister Tamirat appraised the 
Chinese deputy premier of the objective situation in the country 
and Ethiopia's efforts for peace and stability in the subregion. 
  The Chinese foreign minister told the Ethiopian premier that 
China, which maintains a 20-year technical cooperation agreement 
with Ethiopia, will do its level best to further strengthen the 
historical relations of the two friendly countries and 
particularly to develop and promote the agricultural economy of 
the country.

  [Text] There is talk that progress has been made in Lusaka, 
the Zambian capital, where the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] have over the last 
week discussed the issue of the formation of a new national 
police force. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say that UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the principal mediator at 
the talks, has managed to reduce differences between the two 
sides concerning the police issue. Those sources also say that 
the two sides are reported to have reached an understanding that 
the police would be a state administration organ. It is 
noteworthy that UN Special Representative Blondin Beye has had 
separate meetings with the two sides over the last two days with 
a view to narrowing differences over the police issue. 
  Should those reports prove to be true, the negotiators will 
now have to discuss issues pertaining to national 
reconciliation, the future role of the United Nations in Angola, 
UNITA's active participation in government, and the second round 
of presidential elections. Only one thing is quite clear: the 
riot police must really be scrapped.

  [Text] All parastatals and government owned companies have 
been directed to maintain their accounts with the Central Bank 
of Nigeria. The minister of finance, Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu, made 
this known in Abuja while giving a breakdown of this year's 
budget. Dr. Idika Kalu said that the net earnings of government 
establishments in both local and foreign currencies would now be 
brought under the budgetary control of the Federal Ministry of 
Finance. 
  Meanwhile, new policy measures aimed at enhancing the 
generation of more foreign exchange into the economy have been 
allowed by the Federal Government. To this end, all foreign 
exchange earned by the public sector and private headquarters 
are now to be brought into the national foreign exchange 
account. The minister of finance, Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu, who made 
this known while giving a breakdown of this year's budget, 
announced the abolition of the concession formally granted to 
government agencies and private exporters to keep their foreign 
exchange outside the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
  Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu said all imports of foreign exchange 
into 
the country must now be made through the Central Bank of Nigeria 
which he said would guarantee free and unlimited access to such 
funds for importers of goods and services. The minister said 
bureaus de change would henceforth be regarded as agents of the 
Central Bank of Nigeria and they are to sell foreign exchange at 
the rate prescribed by it.

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi says his party should consider terminating 
negotiations with the ANC [African National Congress] and 
government, in favor of opposition politics. As Craig Doonan 
reports, Buthelezi has been addressing a kwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly meeting today: 
  Buthelezi says Inkatha and kwaZulu face two options. One is 
to continue negotiating with the ANC and government, and 
restating its demands repeatedly, while the other is to call 
their bluff and pull out of talks. He said it is time for 
Inkatha to move from a reactive to a proactive position and to 
display to the country a clear message of opposition. Although 
he did not say exactly what type of opposition politics he 
means, he did refer briefly to mobilizing against the 27 April 
election. 
  Buthelezi said the IFP and kwaZulu are wasting time by 
talking to the ANC and government. As he says, their demands 
are not being heard or met. Buthelezi has also called for 
another IFP Central Committee meeting on 22 January, 2 days 
before Parliament reconvenes to adopt amendments to the interim 
constitution. Turning to allegations of hit squads in the 
kwaZulu police, Buthelezi has denied reports of a five-man squad 
operating this force, as revealed by the Goldstone Commission. 
He has also repeated his opposition to the TEC [Transitional 
Exeutive Council], saying the kwaZulu government will not 
recognize this body, nor will it cooperate with it in any way.

  [Text] We have learned from the Rwandan Embassy in Burundi 
that young Tutsi extremists from opposition political parties 
yesterday staged demonstrations outside the Burundi Republican 
Presidency between 1500 and 1600 while Prime Minister Sylvie 
Kinigi was meeting representatives of civic groups and 
opposition parties to explain to them the appropriateness of 
amending Article 85 of the Burundi Constitution in order to seek 
ways and means of restoring peace and tranquillity in Burundi. 
  The amendment of Article 85 of the Burundi Constitution 
should enable the National Assembly to elect a new president of 
the Republic to replace late President Melchior Ndadaye, who was 
assassinated last October. 
  According to the Rwandan Embassy in the Burundi capital, the 
demonstrators were dispersed by security forces. While being 
dispersed, the demonstrators attacked the premises of the 
Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura which they ransacked after breaking 
windows and smashing doors. The Rwandan Embassy, however, has 
given assurances that all Rwandan diplomats in Bujumbura are 
safe and sound. 
  The Rwandan chancery and other diplomatic missions in 
Bujumbura invited the Burundi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to 
visit the scene to see the damage caused by the demonstrators to 
the Rwandan diplomatic mission in Bujumbura.

  [Text] The French ambassador today addressed a diplomatic 
note to the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation in 
which he deeply deplored the fact that during a political 
demonstration on 12 January some participants, after being 
dispersed by the security forces, concluded their demonstration 
by stoning the French Embassy, especially the offices of the 
Mission of Cooperation and Cultural Action. A number of windows 
were broken. 
  He also expressed his concern that the demonstrators later 
moved on to the Rwandan Embassy and that stones were thrown at 
other buildings situated on Uprona Avenue and at stationary 
cars. The ambassador sent a strong protest against the actions. 
He expressed to the competent Burundi authorities the wish that 
steps be taken in the future to avoid a recurrence. 
  In a communique, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Cooperation of the Republic of Rwanda has expressed its feelings 
to the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation of the 
Republic Of burundi and informed the latter that it was dismayed 
to learn of the violation, resulting in great damage, of the 
premises of the Embassy of the Republic of Rwanda in Bujumbura 
yesterday by Burundian citizens. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation also 
protested most vigorously against this lapse by the Government 
of the Republic of Burundi, given the provisions of the 18 April 
1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, especially 
Article 22, Paragraph Two. [passage omitted] 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the 
Republic of Rwanda insisted that the Ministry of External 
Relations and Cooperation of the Republic of Burundi assume its 
responsibilities by ensuring the security of the personnel, 
property, and premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura and 
by quickly proceeding to repair all the damage caused to the 
Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura. 
  It is also worth noting that today Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, 
Burundian minister of external relations, Rwandan Ambassador to 
Burundi Sylvestre Uwibajije, and other diplomats accredited to 
Bujumbura visited the buildings of the Rwandan and French 
Embassies damaged during demonstrations yesterday by youths from 
opposition parties. They took the opportunity to assess the 
extent of the damage. At the end of the visit, the Rwandan 
ambassador to Burundi said that yesterday's attack on the 
premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura was an act of 
provocation, but since Rwanda supported peaceful and 
good-neighborly ties, it refuses to be led into hostilities 
provoked by groups of antidemocratic people. 
  Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo regretted 
the violence which occurred yesterday. He called on Burundian 
political parties to instill in their members the ideals of 
democracy. He regretted that the violence took place at a time 
when those in charge of the main Burundian political forces are 
discussing at the office of the president an accord on the 
principle of a truce aimed at allowing the return of peace in 
the country.

  [Text] The National Assembly has just elected Mr. Cyprien 
Ntaryamira as the new president of the Republic. He was elected 
by 78 votes for him and one vote against. Marie-Jose Niyonziman 
has the details of the proceedings which led to the election: 
  [Begin Niyonziman recording] There was a continuation this 
evening of the ordinary session which began on 4 October and was 
interrupted on 21 October following the events which took place 
in Burundi. On the agenda was the election of the head of state. 
  The election of Cyprien Ntaryamira as president of the 
Republic took place in the presence of all members of the 
government and the diplomatic and consular corps. Of 81 
representatives, 76 were present. The election is the result of 
two days of consultations carried out by Prime Minister Sylvie 
kinigi with political, moral, and social forces to find a 
resolution to the crisis in Burundi. 
  On behalf of the Union for National Progress [Uprona] 
parliamentary group, Jean-Baptiste Manwangari briefed the guests 
and the National Assembly on the evolution of contacts carried 
out during the two days. The central objective was the drafting 
of a schedule and the management of the administration and 
security services, especially for political and ethnic 
minorities. They also agreed on the profile of the candidate, 
who would have to be a person who brings together and reassures 
all the components of Burundi. There was also agreement on the 
creation of openness in provincial and communal administrations. 
The personalities involved in the massacres would not be 
allowed to join them. 
  During the talks, there was a decision on a political truce, 
during which some political activities are to be suspended. It 
is worth recalling the freeing of public media, the creation of 
a framework for dialogue, and the current election of the 
president. At the moment, as I speak to you, the ceremonies are 
continuing at Kigobe. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Deputies meeting at Kigobe have just elected 
Cyprien Ntaryamira as president of the Republic of Burundi. He 
is the former agriculture and livestock minister. [passage 
omitted] 
  After his election, our colleague, Celcius Nsengiyunva, 
asked 
the president about the meaning of the election and his 
priorities to get the country of its crisis. 
  [Begin recording] [Ntaryamira] I am happy, just as all 
Burundians are happy at this moment. I am happy with the step 
we have attained in our efforts, which are still under way, to 
restore peace and security to our country. [passage omitted] 
  [Nsengiyunva] Your Excellency, what will your priorities be? 
  [Ntaryamira] The first job in the coming days will be to 
continue making peace among Burundians by continuing the work of 
restoring the peace and security that have been interrupted in 
our country. We must continue the work of restoring 
understanding between Burundian brothers. 
  The next priority will be to return home those who have fled 
their homes internally and abroad. Then we will place emphasis 
on educating people about respect for human rights, which have 
been trampled on recently. Many people have died, so this is a 
very important job that we will stress. Other things to be done 
soon will be to rebuild what has been destroyed. This is a lot 
to do. You know well that many houses were demolished. [Words 
indistinct] bridges, and many other things were destroyed during 
the events. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Yaounde, Jan 13 (AFP) -- Academic authorities 
suspended courses at the Yaounde II University on Thursday 
following clashes between Cameroon police and students the 
previous day, official sources said. 
  Police used water cannon to drive off 100 students marching 
on the prime minister's office here on Wednesday to protest 
against the death of 10 students killed in a road accident. 
Some students also set fire to the university vice chancellor's 
offices to object to a decision to transfer courses for 15,000 
students to the new Yaounde II premises, where there are neither 
drinking water nor canteen facilities. 
  Angry undergraduates said their fellows were killed when a 
minibus taking them to university was in collision at dawn with 
a truck on the outskirts of town. 
  Students are also calling for transport to be laid on. For 
lack of buses, they are often forced to hitch rides on trucks 
carrying sand on the road from Yaounde to Sao, 13 kilometres 
(eight miles) from the capital, where the university lies. 
  The urban transport authority introduced a new route two 
weeks ago, but the buses ran for just three days before breaking 
down. 
  In another development Thursday, the government suspended 
the 
salaries of 73 teachers who have been on strike since November 
24. Prime Minister Simon Achidi Achu had Tuesday warned of 
measures against striking civil servants.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 14 Jan (AFP) -- Congolese soldiers 
fired heavy artillery overnight in response to machine-gun 
attacks by armed opposition supporters in two southern districts 
of the capital, military sources said Friday. The shooting died 
down later and only sporadic gunfire was to be heard in the 
morning. 
  The violence broke out when forces loyal to opposition 
leader 
Bernard Kolelas launched an incursion into the Diata area, a 
sector of the Makele-Kele district, which is controlled by 
supporters of President Pascal Lissouba, the sources said. The 
militiamen were driven back by government troops, they said, but 
there were no details of casualties. 
  Opposition spokesman Laurent Mann gave no reason for the 
sudden renewal of clashes after more than a week of calm in 
Makele-Kele and Bacongo, an opposition stronghold. He said that 
government forces deployed heavy weapons in Diata and aimed 
shells at Bacongo. "We don't yet know how much damage the firing 
has caused," he added. 
  Clashes between armed opposition militiamen and government 
forces have killed 110 people in Brazzaville since the beginning 
of December, according to hospital staff.

  [Text] Libreville, Jan 13 (AFP) -- The Gabonese Government 
decided Thursday [13 January] to freeze prices of basic goods, 
fuels, and public services, government spokesman Patrice 
Nziengui announced here. 
  He said the move came in an effort to counter the 
inflationary effects of the 50-percent devaluation this week of 
the CFA franc. 
  The goods whose prices are frozen include bread, flour, 
rice, 
cooking oil, soap, sugar, milk, meat and fish, he said. "Price 
controls are being strengthened for existing stocks of goods to 
avoid improper price increases," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of the Zairian </F>
Union for Democracy and Social Progress, by AFRICAN EVENTS 
reporter Jean-Marie Mabiti Angali, in Kinshasa "at the end of 
the year" -- first two paragraphs are editorial introduction] 
  [Text] In the upheavals of recent months, there has 
sometimes been criticism of the silence maintained by Etienne 
Tshisekedi, the symbolic figure of the opposition and the prime 
minister elected by the Sovereign National Conference [CNS]. 
For a large section of this opposition, he is essential and 
should be prime minister during the transition. But it is not 
at all certain that Mobutu will give him his backing. 
  A few hours, or a few days at most, before the appointment 
of 
a new government chief, we are publishing an interview with the 
leader of the UDPS (Union for Democracy and Social Progress). 
These remarks were gathered at the end of the year by 
Jean-Marie Mabiti Angali, a reporter from AFRICAN EVENTS, an 
African magazine published in Brussels. They give an idea of 
Tshisekedi's state of mind. In his view, the democratic process 
is irreversible and no attention should be paid to Mobutu's 
maneuvers. 
  [Angali] Despite the current problems, you still seem to 
enjoy great popularity among the Zairian population. You, 
therefore, seem essential. What is the basis of this popularity? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is difficult to know what the basis of this 
popularity is. I presume that the population recognizes that I 
have the merit of having fought the dictatorship from within and 
having forced it to make the current concessions. The people 
probably appreciate the constancy of my approach in our people's 
liberation struggle. 
  Above all, it is important that the people should recognize 
the sacrifices that I have made with so many others to bring the 
country to the present situation. We are sure that there will 
be full democracy. Whatever the current problems, democracy is 
a definitive achievement in our country. 
  [Angali] The country is currently awaiting the result of the 
political negotiations to end the duplication of institutions. 
What is your view of this situation? 
  [Tshisekedi] If we have reached this situation, it is 
entirely due to Mobutu upping the stakes. He is aware of the 
pressures being exerted by the people for him to resign and to 
leave the country. He has committed enough crimes already. 
Knowing the state of mind of the people, he is using his 
weapons and his tribal police to resist the people's will. All 
his machinations are also aimed at showing that the institutions 
are worth nothing without him. This must not be taken 
seriously. It is just his way of resisting change. The people 
have shown for months that they had confidence in our government 
and not in that of the political vagabonds who are an object of 
ridicule for our people. 
<H5>  Mobutu the Adventurer </H5>
  [Angali] You are well acquainted with Mobutu. What did you 
have in common that enabled you to work together for many years? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is wrong to say that we worked together. He 
did not take me into his government. Following his coup d'etat 
in 1965, he appointed General Mulamba as prime minister. He 
asked the deputies and senators to submit to him two ministerial 
candidates per region. As a young deputy, I was chosen and 
became interior minister. 
  The fact that I worked in that government has nothing to do 
with Mobutu. I was determined to serve my country which was 
beset by major problems. If I was with Mobutu, it was simply to 
serve my country. 
  [Angali] So all you had in common was that desire to serve 
the country? 
  [Tshisekedi] In all events, that was my concern. I cannot 
speak for him. I can only judge him on what was seen later. I 
saw that he was in fact an adventurer and not a man serving the 
people. At first, he managed to deceive everybody by what he 
said. 
  We jointly founded the Popular Movement of the Revolution 
[MPR], not as a single party, but as a party which was to exist 
alongside another, in a real two-party system. 
  We jointly wrote the Constitution of 24 June 1967. It made 
provisions for a two-party system. But when it was adopted by 
referendum, he realized that it would have to be implemented. 
He caused me enough problems on that subject and finally forced 
me out of the government in August 1969. At that time, I did 
not understand much. 
  However, I understood when Mobutu carried out various 
maneuvers to remove Article 4 of the Constitution, which made 
provisions for that two-party system, and convened the MPR in 
1970. The aim was to establish the single party. 
  It was then that I really knew that he was an adventurer. I 
withdrew my confidence and support from him. However, at the 
time he was very strong and it was impossible to start an open 
struggle with him. I, therefore, took my time to avoid being an 
martyr. 
  I took advantage of my democratic reelection as a deputy in 
1977 to launch actions against the dictatorship within 
Parliament with other colleagues. 
  So, you know why I fought against the dictatorship. This 
fight is now on the point of succeeding. I no longer believe in 
Mobutu's power to withstand the movement toward democracy. 
  [Angali] It is sometimes said that your struggle is 
primarily 
the result of personal rather than political disagreements... 
  [Tshisekedi] I started the struggle for our people's 
liberation with 12 parliamentary colleagues. We published an 
open letter which is the basis of the action. All those who say 
that I am settling personal scores merely have to reread that 
letter. There is nothing personal in it. The letter notes the 
Mobutu regime's failure and advocates what political behavior to 
adopt for the democratization of the nation. 
  [Angali] Some people think that the present crisis is a 
crisis about individuals. You seem sincere, as Mobutu was on 24 
April 1990... 
  [Tshisekedi] Mobutu has never been sincere. He simply gave 
in to internal and external pressures for democracy. But he 
made every effort to oppose the process. Fortunately, there are 
men who are fighting to achieve democracy. 
<H5>  Respecting the Conference </H5>
  [Angali] There have been several attempts at cohabitation 
between you. Is this still possible? 
  [Tshisekedi] There is no question of attempts at 
cohabitation. We have abandoned the dictatorial culture, the 
Second Republic in which one individual ruled the whole nation. 
With the CNS, we entered a new culture: That of democracy in 
which everybody must submit to the majority and the law. 
Because I was democratically elected through the CNS, there is 
no question of discussing cohabitation. Everybody must submit 
to the CNS plan. Nobody can replace it by another. If it is 
not respected, the liberation struggle will continue. 
  [Angali] One of the criticisms made against you is that many 
people think you made a mistake when you crossed out any mention 
of the constitution on your appointment in October 1991. What 
is your reply to them? 
  [Tshisekedi] There was no reason for me to accept that 
because that constitution, instituting the one-party state, had 
been dead since 24 April 1990. In addition, we discussed it and 
Mobutu agreed to me swearing allegiance only to the law and not 
to a Constitution which no longer existed. He presented me with 
a fait accompli. I could not accept it. 
  [Angali] You have experienced Zaire's history. On the basis 
of that experience, do you think that a parliamentary system is 
viable in our country? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is fully viable. If it is freely engendered 
by the people, it reflects the maturity attained by them in 
their concept of the state and the political system. It will 
therefore succeed, especially because it is not being imposed 
from outside. 
  If it proves to have imperfections in practice, it is for 
the 
people to make any adjustments. A system freely designed by the 
people must be administered by them. 
<H5>  UDPS in the Majority </H5>
  [Angali] After the transition, will you be a candidate in 
the 
parliamentary or presidential elections? 
  [Tshisekedi] I will naturally be a candidate. However, the 
party will first hold a congress which will appoint the 
presidential candidate on the basis of the various nominations 
submitted. 
  [Angali] Some UDPS members have defected recently. Does that 
affect you? 
  [Tshisekedi] No. The UDPS is now the majority party in Zaire 
and cannot be too much affected by the departure of some people. 
  [Angali] At the national conference, you forgave those who 
wronged you. Do you forgive those who have left the party? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is not a question of forgiveness but of 
respecting everybody's convictions. That is democracy. I 
respect convictions and individuals. 
  I do not like dogmas. I am a pragmatist. 
  [Angali] Is the UDPS a tribal party? 
  [Tshisekedi] I think that the UDPS has proved its 
nationalism. To lead the people where we have led them, tribal 
questions must be abandoned. I do not concern myself with 
tribal problems. 
<H5>  Western Support </H5>
  [Angali] Do you believe in the support of the Western 
troika? 
  [Tshisekedi] I prefer to think that it supports the 
democratization process rather than an individual. Institutions 
must be supported rather than individuals. 
  [Angali] Do you think the Belgians still know Zaire? 
  [Tshisekedi] I think they, of all foreigners, know the 
country best. Some mistakes have probably been made. However, 
they are primarily the result of the machinations of a certain 
political class, particularly the one which grew up alongside 
Mobutu. They are now in opposition, but they are still working 
for Mobutu. 
  [Angali] If you obtain power in the future, will you reopen 
the Belgian-Zairian dispute? 
  [Tshisekedi] Tshisekedi will never be a dictator replacing 
the other dictator. This is a democratic country and we must 
respect the laws, the institutions. Parliament will have to 
discuss this question if it thinks it is necessary to do so. 
  [Angali] How can the crisis be solved? 
  [Tshisekedi] Mobutu must be involved in the CNS plan. All 
the solutions have been laid down by it, Mobutu must agree to 
implement them with us. In that way, there will be no crisis.

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today at 
State House, Nairobi, received a high-level Japanese economic 
and technical delegation. The leader of the delegation, Mr. 
Masao Sawaki, informed President Moi that Japan would increase 
its funding of specific projects to Kenya by 50 percent in the 
next five years. Mr. Sawaki said Japan placed Kenya in high 
esteem, especially due to her rapid development. This, he said, 
was the reason the delegation came to reappraise its support for 
Kenya's development. 
  President Moi thanked the government and people of Japan for 
their enormous contribution to Kenya's development since 
independence. He added that, because of this support, Kenya 
regarded Japan as a true friend and partner in development and, 
noting that he was committed to environmental conservation as it 
guaranteed the success of future development efforts, the 
president said he would appreciate assistance to construct 
several dams in the country. 
  He informed the Japanese delegation that Kenya's rapid 
development was mainly due to the uninterrupted peace since 
independence and the participation of wananchi [citizens] in the 
harambee [communal fund-raising] self-help strategy. President 
Moi said he attached great importance to security and added that 
the issue would be given the attention it deserved. [passage

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 13 (AFP) -- Somalia's warring clans 
held peace talks in Mogadishu on Thursday [13 January] as 
warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid negotiated with his opponents in the 
Kenyan capital, Nairobi, a senior Aidid aide said here. 
  Reporters were turned away from the talks at a hotel in the 
north Mogadishu enclave of General Aidid's enemy self-styled 
interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
  The secretary of the meeting, Mohamed Hassan, declined to 
give details on progress at the talks, bringing together members 
of Aidid's Habr Gedir sub-clan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal under the 
chairmanship of a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, 
without UN involvement. He said the participants, traditional 
clan leaders and elders rather than warlords such as Aidid and 
Ali Mahdi, would issue a statement when the meeting concluded 
"in a couple of days." 
  Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's 
Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, confirmed that Habr 
Gedir representatives were attending. "The talks have been 
going on over the past month in order to create an atmosphere of 
understanding among the sub-clans," Darman told reporters at the 
SNA office in Aidid's south Mogadishu stronghold. "Both groups 
are well represented on the basis of the sub-clans, not 
political organisations," he said. 
  Fighting between Ali Mahdi's Abgal forces and Aidid's Habr 
Gedir militia reduced much of central Mogadishu to rubble before 
the first U.S. troops landed in December 1992 to end a famine 
that killed an estimated 300,000 people. 
  Darman, a former Somali ambassador to the United States and 
China, expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks. "I 
don't think there will again be war in Mogadishu between the 
Abgal and the Habr Gedir," he said. 
  Ali Mahdi, however, has repeatedly warned that civil war 
will 
engulf Somalia after U.S. troops leave in March. He has urged 
the UN to keep peacekeepers here despite Aidid's insistence that 
they must go. 
  Aidid, Ali Mahdi, and 13 other factional leaders agreed at 
UN- brokered talks in March to form a transitional national 
council to govern Somalia for two years until elections. But 
the process was halted by Aidid's conflict with the United 
Nations, which cost the lives of more than 70 peacekeepers 
before the world body dropped efforts to arrest the warlord in 
October. Further UN-sponsored peace talks sponsored in Addis 
Ababa last month collapsed without agreement. African and 
Western diplomats have since voiced mounting pessimism about the 
likelihood of a negotiated settlement. 
  Darman said the current clan meeting signalled a new 
initiative, together with talks he said were going on in Nairobi 
between Aidid and representatives of a group of 12 factions that 
oppose him, led by Ali Mahdi. 
  Darman said eight senior SNA officials with Aidid in Nairobi 
had been negotiating for two or three days with eight delegates 
from the group of 12 led by Abdullahi Yusuf, leader of a faction 
that controls northeast Somalia. 
  Sources close to Ali Mahdi said he was in daily contact by 
telephone with General Abdullahi, whose Somali Salvation 
Democratic Alliance belongs to the group of 12. But Ali Mahdi 
himself was not immediately available to confirm that talks were 
being held. 
  Darman said an agreement on Somalia's political future had 
nearly been reached in Nairobi, but the 12 had backed out at the 
last moment. 
  The head of the UN Operation in Somalia, Jonathan Howe, 
seemed unaware of the clan talks in Mogadishu, but stressed that 
"there's a lot of dialogue going on." 
  "It's a Somali process," he said Wednesday in remarks seen 
as 
a shift by the UN towards playing a less directive role in 
brokering the restoration of civilian authority in Somalia, 
without a government since the 1991 overthrow of former ruler 
Mohamed Siad Barre.

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Peace talks between 
clansmen of factional leader Mohamed Farah Aidid and those of 
his enemy, self-styled President Ali Mahdi Mohamed, went into a 
second day here Friday. 
  General Aidid meanwhile continued negotiations in the Kenyan 
capital, Nairobi, with representatives of the Group of 12 
factions led by Ali Mahdi that oppose him, Aidid's aides said 
here. 
  The United Nations, heavily criticised for getting 
peacekeepers embroiled in clashes with Aidid's militia that cost 
the lives of more than 70 UN soldiers, was officially involved 
in neither the Nairobi, nor the Mogadishu talks. But Aidid has 
met U.S. envoy Richard Bogosian in Nairobi, an American official 
in Mogadishu said. 
  Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's 
Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, urged the UN to arrange 
another national reconciliation conference to bring Somalia's 
warring factions together. But he said the UN should stop 
meddling in negotiations and leave the Somalis to work out a 
settlement without outside interference. "We hope the Nairobi 
talks will pave the way for a national reconciliation conference 
which might be held in Mogadishu," Darman told reporters. 
  About 175 members of Aidid's Habr Gedir clan and Ali Mahdi's 
Abgal group held a second day of closed-door talks at the Kah 
Hotel in Ali Mahdi's north Mogadishu enclave Friday. Chaired by 
a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, the meeting 
brought together traditional clan chiefs, the "Ugaasis," 
religious leaders, military officers and leaders of youth 
groups, conference officials said. The negotiators were 
expected to announce the outcome of the talks, which were 
preceded by a month of informal consultations, when they end 
Saturday [15 January]. 
  Senior UN officials who were privately skeptical about 
previous attempts to broker agreements among Somalia's 15 
warring clan-based factions said they sensed a greater 
willingness by the warlords to lay down their arms. "They are 
under pressure from their own rank and file," said one UN 
official. "The warlords themselves have done well out of the 
fighting, but the fighters are tired." 
  Aidid's faction is estimated to have lost hundreds of men in 
four months of fighting with U.S. and UN forces in Mogadishu 
before the UN dropped efforts to arrest him in October. 
  In other developments, a UN spokesman said a Somali had been 
shot dead during an anti-UN protest in a coastal town south of 
Mogadishu this week. UN officials had earlier said no one was 
killed and denied reports on pro-Aidid Radio Mogadishu that two 
people had died when a demonstration outside a residence of the 
UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in Merca, about 60 kilometres 
(35 miles) southwest of here, turned violent. "UNOSOM guards 
fired in the air. The demonstrators fired back, and in so doing 
killed a Somali," said UN spokesman Major Tim McDavitt. The 
UNOSOM guards were Somalis, he said. 
  In another attack on the UN, a residence of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Buale, southern Somalia, came under 
rifle-propelled grenade and small arms fire for several hours on 
Thursday evening. There were no casualties. The attackers were 
believed to be bandits, McDavitt said. 
  Five Indian soldiers were wounded earlier the same day in an 
ambush 70 kilometres (40 miles) south of Buale, just outside 
Jilib. 
  Five U.S. congressmen were expected in Mogadishu on Saturday 
for a brief visit, U.S. spokesman Colonel Steve Rausch said. 
The delegation leader is Representative John Murtha, chairman 
of the House Defence Appropriations Committee, a Democrat from 
Pennsylvania. 
  The 5,563 American soldiers in Somalia are to leave by March 
31, but Washington may keep a Marine force offshore.

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 13 (AFP) -- Five Indian soldiers were 
wounded in a night ambush on a UN military patrol by 
unidentified attackers in southern Somalia early Thursday [13 
January], a UN spokesman said. "They were hurt when a 
command-detonated device exploded under their truck and it 
overturned," UN spokesman Major Tim McDavitt said. "Their 
injuries were from the truck rolling over, not from shrapnel." 
  All five Indians were reported in "stable condition" at a UN 
hospital in the southern port of Kismayo, about 100 kilometres 
(60 miles) south of the ambush site just outside the town of 
Jilib. 
  The explosion under the middle vehicle in convoy of three 
trucks on patrol was followed by an exchange of small arms fire 
with unidentified Somalis. The motive for the attack was 
unknown. 
  Meanwhile three Somalis were killed and 12 others injured by 
an explosion which occurred while they were digging in a trash 
pit near a U.S. base in Mogadishu, a U.S. spokesman said. 
Colonel Steve Rausch said U.S. soldiers from nearby Victory 
Base gave six of the wounded first aid and drove them to a 
Romanian field hospital at the UN-controlled airport. The other 
six wounded were also admitted to the Romanian hospital. No 
further details were immediately available about the blast. 
  Lieutenant General Abu-Samah Abu-Bakar of Malaysia arrived 
here Thursday to assume military command of the UN Operation in 
Somalia (UNOSOM). Outgoing commander Lieutenant General Cevik 
Bir of Turkey and his deputy, the U.S. force commander 
Major-General Thomas Montgomery, welcomed Abu-Samah in a brief 
ceremony at the UN- controlled airport attended by about 100 
soldiers from Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt. 
Jonathan Howe, a former U.S. admiral, remains in overall 
command of UNOSOM. 
  Bir, who has been military chief since the United States 
transferred command of the multinational intervention in Somalia 
to the United Nations in May, will officially hand over command 
to Abu- Samah on Tuesday [18 January]. 
  Malaysia has nearly 900 soldiers in Somalia. 
  Abu-Samah met the visiting commander of the U.S. Navy 
Central 
Command, Vice Admiral Douglas Katz, soon after his arrival. 
Katz was to leave Friday after inspecting the UN-controlled 
port.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 14 SAPA -- Trilateral talks between the 
government, the African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom 
Alliance have been scheduled to resume next Wednesday, Alliance 
leaders announced after a meeting on Friday. However, Ciskei 
told the meeting it was withdrawing from the five-member 
negotiating forum to join the Transitional Executive Council. 
  Participants in the talks hope to break the political 
impasse 
with the Freedom Alliance. The three sides, after two rounds of 
trilateral talks at the end of last year, gave themselves until 
January 24 to broker an inclusive political deal. 
  "The leaders of the Freedom Alliance...recommitted 
themselves 
to the negotiation process, with the aim of finding an 
all-inclusive political settlement for southern Africa," they 
said in a statement on Friday. A new round of talks had 
provisionally been set for next Wednesday, they said. 
  The decision by Ciskei to withdraw its membership was 
announced at the end of the five-hour meeting at the 
Bophuthatswana Embassy. The remaining Alliance leaders were at 
pains to stress Ciskei's withdrawal in no way affected Bisho's 
"commitment to the position of the Freedom Alliance and its 
demands for an improved constitution". 
  "Ciskei will continue to uphold these positions in its 
future 
political activities." 
  The leaders expressed "deep understanding" of Ciskei's 
position, but regretted they felt obliged to accept the 
withdrawal. "Since the Convention for a Democratic South Africa 
(Codesa), Ciskei has been subjected to destabilisation action by 
the ANC, and the vulnerability of Ciskei to further 
destabilisation and pressure from the Transitional Executive 
Council is very unfortunate." 
  Present at Friday's meeting were, among others, Inkatha 
Freedom Party president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Conservative Party 
leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front] leaders Gen Constand Viljoen and Gen Tienie 
Groenewald, Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope, 
Bophuthatswana chief negotiator and Alliance Chairman Rowan 
Cronje, deputy chairman of Ciskei's Council of State Col Simons 
Pita and Ciskei chief negotiator Mickey Webb.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] and its 
political opponents appear to be heading for yet another clash 
-- this time over mineral rights and mining. At the center of 
the controversy is an ANC-alliance document on the future of 
minerals. The document, which describes mineral wealth as a 
national asset could become ANC policy if it is adopted at a 
special two-day conference at the end of January. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] South Africa is well known for 
its mineral riches. It is these minerals that are the focus of 
an ANC document on the future exploitation of minerals. The ANC 
says mineral wealth belongs to all South Africans and shouldn't 
be in the hands of a few monopolies. Their idea is not to 
nationalize the mines, but to tax the minerals which are being 
mined. Part of the plan is that mining companies will no longer 
own the actual land but will have to lease it from the 
government. 
  [ANC spokesman Paul Jourdan] The other aspects of the RDP 
[Reconstruction and Development Program] are a round ... 
[pauses] making the industry grow, what we call widening the 
industry, that means opening up new mines and what we call 
deepening the industry, that is using our minerals further 
downstream -- using our minerals to make mineral products, to 
add value, to increase the foreign exchange earnings, to 
increase employment, to increase government revenue. 
  [Reporter] The Chamber of Mines says it will only comment on 
the document once it becomes policy, but at least three 
political parties, the NP [National Party], the DP [Democratic 
Party], and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] have called it 
nothing more than nationalization. The National Party said the 
ANC was still clinging to its socialistic policies. The DP said 
the plan would undermine investor confidence and the economy and 
the IFP said the proposal was nothing less than nationalization 
by stealth. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The ANC's [African National Congress] draft plan 
to revamp the mining industry has not only caused ripples 
locally. Internationally it has also being labeled as 
nationalization. Share prices on the Johannesburg Stock 
Exchange plunged sharply right after the announcement with the 
gold index weakening by nearly 5 percent. Industrial shares 
dropped by 2.1 percent, and the overall index by 2.5 percent. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Conservative Party [CP] has condemned the proposal 
saying 
that most mines were situated in the area it wanted to turn into 
a volkstaat [nation state], therefore, the CP would only 
relinquish mineral rights after a struggle.

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] has joined the 
Democratic Party [DP] and the National Party [NP] in criticizing 
the ANC's [African National Congress] draft policy document on 
mining as an attempt at nationalization. The IFP said in a 
statement that the proposed new ANC policy was a concealed 
attempt at nationalization in line with Marxist aspects of the 
Freedom Charter. The IFP added that the document raised 
questions on the broader issue of property rights, including 
that over several categories of agricultural land. 
  In its reaction to the ANC document, the Chamber of Mines 
expressed reservations about the proposal to regard minerals as 
a national asset. The chamber said the mining industry was 
prepared to listen to proposals for the improvement of the 
existing system of mineral rights developed over hundreds of 
years, but that the matter had to be considered very thoroughly. 
The chamber has been discussing the future of the industry with 
interested parties, including the ANC and the National Union of 
Mineworkers for some time and would continue these discussions. 
  The ANC said mineral rights could be hired from the state on 
a renewable long term basis. It said that no decision had been 
taken yet on the way in which the change would be brought about, 
but that it would not be done through a process of 
nationalization. The document will be discussed at a conference 
on 22 and 23 January before becoming ANC policy.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 14 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] on Friday released its legislative priorities for 
a new government in redressing past socio-economic imbalances. 
Addressing a media conference in Johannesburg, former Congress 
of SA [South African] Trade Unions Secretary General and ANC 
election candidate Jay Naidoo said the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme [RDP] would be the basis of a legislative 
programme for a new government at all levels. 
  The programme puts forward various mechanisms for the 
implementation of its proposals and retains nationalisation and 
the creation of a reconstruction levy as two of those policy 
options. 
  The RDP document was a concrete programme for addressing the 
expectations of large sectors of the population who had suffered 
as a result of inequality and imbalances in housing, education, 
health and employment, he said. 
  The RDP would seek to harness the resources of all sectors 
of 
society to tackle socio-economic disadvantages although the 
state would play a leading role. "A government that invests 
heavily in infrastructure," he said, "will meet the needs of our 
people and stimulate economic growth." 
  The RDP document focusses on five key areas: meeting basic 
needs, developing human resources, building the economy, 
democratising the state and society, and implementing the RDP. 
  The programme seeks to redistribute over the next five years 
a substantial amount of land to landless people, build over one 
million houses, provide clean water and sanitation to all, 
electrify 2.5-million new homes and provide access to everybody 
for affordable health care and telecommunications. 
  On the economy, the RDP proposes considerable trade and 
industrial reform to achieve international competitiveness 
s?ed employment creation. It points to t he imperative of 
developing a large domestic?uring sector that makes greater use 
of the country's raw materials and minerals. 
  Although the cost of the programme would be large, the ANC 
said it could largely be met within the existing government 
budget, as well as by accessing new and innovative forms of 
financing. ANC economics head Trevor Manuel said the emphasis 
would be to promote more efficient governmental spending through 
better social expenditure delivery systems and state capital 
investment. 
  He said the financial sector would have to be encouraged to 
mobilise and direct more resources from housing to the promotion 
of small and medium sized enterprises. The RDP considers 
increasing the public sector in "strategic areas" through 
nationalisation, purchasing of shareholding in companies, 
setting up new public corporations or joint ventures with 
private sector. 
  On the other hand, it also proposes reducing the public 
sector to enhance efficiency, advance affirmative action and 
create employment. "Such a mixed economy will foster a new and 
constructive relationship between the people, the democratic 
government, the trade union movement, the private sector and the 
market," the RDP documents states. 
  The final draft of the RDP document will be discussed by a 
special ANC conference next weekend before being adopted as its 
election platform.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 14 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress' Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] 
released Friday calls for widespread reform of the financial 
sector including prescriptive legislation on lending and 
investment. In addition, the document urges the creation of 
innovative financial instruments and mechanisms, like a 
reconstruction levy, to fund the still to be determined cost of 
the RDP. 
  "If excessive risk aversion in the major financial 
institutions prevents them from taking up socially desireable 
investments, the democratic government should consider some form 
of legislative compulsion such as prescribed assets," the 
document says. It notes the government cannot fund the RDP 
without support from the private sector and states therefore 
that regulations should be modified to compel financial 
institutions to fund basic needs such as housing, education, and 
health-care. 
  Legislation would be introduced to transform the boards of 
mutual fund companies "to make them more socially responsible". 
  A new government must impose non-discriminatory lending 
criteria, especially related to collateral, and require the 
banks to lend a rising share of their assets to small, 
black-owned enterprises. 
  With regard to specific measures to fund the RDP, a new 
government would set up a reconstruction fund and include some 
form of a dedicated reconstruction bond. "In addition, it 
should draw on specific reconstruction levies. The design of 
reconstruction levies will depend on the aims of the RDP as a 
whole, especially in terms of promoting development and growth, 
but could also include levies on capital transfers, land and 
luxury goods." 
  A housing bank is mooted by the document as well as a 
government-backed guarantee fund to protect private sector 
investors. 
  Many of the proposals are expected to be financed through 
the 
capital markets and would not necessitate a massive increase in 
government revenue. The RDP envisages restructuring and 
rationalising current government expenditure to meet the most of 
the costs of the RDP so as to avoid undue inflation and balance 
of payments difficulties. 
  "Given the fiscal malaise left by apartheid, careful 
programmes must be developed around financing increased capital 
expenditure, increasing the efficiency of consumption 
expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of the 
government." 
  The RDP documents states the current budget deficit of six 
per cent of gross domestic product would not be exceeded and 
neither should the overall tax burden be increased. 
  Foreign funding in support of the RDP would only be used for 
those elements of the programme which would increase the 
country's capacity for earning foreign exchange.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 14 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela has conceded his 
organisation has shifted significantly from its nationalisation 
policies contained in its Freedom Charter. "We have guaranteed 
investors against confiscation of their property and have 
guaranteed their right to repatriate their profits and 
dividends. Although the clause on mining is still in the 
Freedom Charter, we have made the shift away from 
nationalisation," he told delegates at the ANC Youth League 
[ANCYL] conference in Soweto on Friday. 
  The ANCYL's annual conference is the last before the April 
27 
general election. 
  Mr Mandela said it was important to organise the economy to 
enable it to deliver the goods in the face of high expectations 
from the people. "If the ANC government is unable to deliver 
the goods, then you should overthrow it because it is not good," 
he said. 
  He said the ANC had also agreed to a code of conduct for 
senior officials to avert the "gravy train" psychosis brought on 
by apartheid. He said part of the code stated that any member 
of the organisation receiving a donation of more than 
R[rand]100,000 should immediately report it to the movement 
because the organisation did not want its senior officials to be 
unduly influenced. 
  He said salaries of government ministers after April 27 
would 
have to be commensurate with those of people in industry as 
there was a tendency by state officials to live beyond the means 
of ordinary people. 
  On violence, Mr Mandela said politically-inspired 
disturbances had to be settled to ensure international 
investment. 
  He said National Party [NP] leader Mr F W de Klerk was 
convinced he would receive the support of most whites, coloureds 
and Indians, and that violence would keep Africans away from 
polling booths and so boost the NP's chances. This was in line 
with NP strategy of using violence to prevent a decisive ANC 
victory in the election, Mr Mandela claimed. 
  He said there was a time when the ANC was proud to proclaim 
it was not involved in violence, but rogue elements within self 
defence units [SDU] had changed this. "We must admit that 
discipline has broken down within some SDUs." 
  Mr Mandela warned youths against complacency in the run-up 
to 
the elections. He said the challenge was to ensure the 
organisation won 67 percent of votes as indicated in some 
opinion polls.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has called for 
the resignation of Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte. The 
organization says Schutte must go because of his inability to 
stop right-wingers from operating radio station. 
  ANC northern [Orange] Free State Branch Chairman (Johannes 
Tlali) has condemned the establishment of the right-wing Radio 
Koppies [small hills] in his area. The station has been on the 
air for about a month. Radio Pretoria is continuing broadcasts 
this week despite the expiry of its temporary license, and Radio 
Vryheid [freedom] has been set up near Bloemfontein. (Tlali) 
says Schutte seems unable, or unwilling to deal with the 
stations. He has called on the Transitional Executive Council 
to set up the independent broadcasting authority as soon as 
possible to control all broadcasting frequency bands without 
bias.

  [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in the Transvaal 
says some Zulus will be staying away from work on Monday. The 
Transvaal IFP leader Themba Khoza says the stayaway call has 
been made by local traditional Zulu leaders and not the IFP. 
Khoza was speaking at a news conference called to explain an 
apparent clash between IFP national and the Transvaal region. 
Reports have said that West Rand IFP leader Humphrey Ndlovu 
called on Zulus to stay away and to go to Pretoria's Union 
Buildings on Monday. That's because President F.W. de Klerk is 
meeting Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. IFP national spokesman 
Ziba Jiyane distanced the IFP from the call, now Khoza says 
Ndlovu was misquoted. 
  [Begin Khoza recording] The entire operations rest on the 
Zulu leaders, in other words, traditional leaders, 
representatives of Amakhosi [chiefs] in these regions who met 
yesterday and who actually issued the statement. The long and 
the short of the story is that the IFP is not the one who is

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 13 SAPA -- The Boer Republican Army 
(BRA) has warned foreign peace observers to leave the country or 
face death, and has also threatened to paralyse South Africa's 
economic infrastructure through "unheard-of economic sabotage". 
The warnings were contained in a message sent to SAPA on 
Thursday. 
  The BRA also declared war on the "communist anti-christian" 
Transitional Executive Council. 
  The BRA previously claimed responsiblity for several bomb 
blasts, including last month's sabotage of a powerline tower 
near Boksburg prison. Two people died and at least 14 were 
injured when a minibus taxi hit dangling powerlines soon after 
the blast which, Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] said, was 
caused by explosives. 
  Little is known about the BRA. It was founded in 1991 and 
sends facsimile advisories. Its leadership is unknown and 
unreachable. 
  In its facsimile message on Thursday, it said its previous 
acts of sabotage had not been taken seriously. "Now intensive 
action will be taken." 
  It warned foreign peace observers they would not be ignored 
in its campaign, but its main target would be the "heartbeat of 
the satanic money powers". The BRA said it would rather destroy 
everything the Boerevolk [Boer people] had worked for than hand 
it to alien money powers.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 13 SAPA -- An African National Congress 
[ANC] member's reported boasts about how he and his comrades 
killed political opponents like chickens vindicated Afrikaner 
Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] warnings and should 
not surprise the government. AVF spokesman Stephan Maninger said 
on Thursday: "Not only have we been saying as much, but the 
National Party [NP] government also has had access to security 
infrastructure through which it must have been aware of the fact 
that the ANC has never stopped conducting terror attacks which 
include political killings." 
  Mr Maninger was reacting to newspaper and radio reports 
quoting an East Rand Self Defence Unit [SDU] member, codenamed 
Tembo, as saying killing particular people did not worry him. 
  Tembo reportedly said: "I don't think about it because that 
is the situation, that when we kill particular people, for me it 
is like I have killed a chicken because I see no reason for him 
to live if he does not understand what the will of the people 
is, and what we are fighting for." 
  The AVF found it strange that the NP had reacted to the 
report by accusing the ANC of a "massive disinformation campaign 
to blame others for the violence", said Mr Maninger. "Two days 
ago State President F W de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
were jointly blaming so-called elements on the right for the 
township violence. "Consequently we see (NP information 
director) Marthinus van Schalkwyk's attack on the ANC as 
shadow-boxing for political gain. 
  "Instead, he and his party should refrain from fabricated 
and 
false accusations against the AVF and we suggest they act 
against the true culprits who kill people."

Klerk on Friday [14 January] welcomed Japan's proposal to send 
election monitors to observe South Africa's first multiracial 
parliamentary elections set for late April, Japanese officials 
said. 
  De Klerk told Japan's Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister 
Syozo Azuma that he was encouraged with Japan's intention to 
contribute to the development of Southern Africa. 
  Azuma, who met with the president in Pretoria, conveyed 
Tokyo's decision to help South Africa conduct the April election 
successfully, the officials said. Azuma is currently in South 
Africa on a 23-day, nine-nation tour of Africa and South Asia 
that began January 5. 
  Japan and Pretoria will later discuss details of the 
proposal 
such as the scale of the monitoring mission, the officials said. 
  On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
proposed to the Security Council the dispatch of some 1,800 
people for monitoring the South African elections.

  [Text] Kimberley Jan 13 SAPA -- The Democratic Party was 
the only party which could repair the damage caused by decades 
of apartheid policies, DP [Democratic Party] leader Zach de Beer 
claimed at an election meeting in Kimberley on Thursday. 
  Unlike the National Party [NP] and the African National 
Congress [ANC], the DP met all the criteria needed to make the 
country and its citizens prosperous, Mr de Beer said. 
  These included the fact that the DP was democratic, 
supported 
peace and stability, favoured free enterprise, trade and 
business and believed in small government, low public 
expenditure, low taxes and privatisation where appropriate. The 
DP also had no links with socialism and communism. 
  Mr de Beer said that if the ANC and NP purported to be 
democrats it would be of the "instant" variety. It had become 
convenient for these two parties to change their tunes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Boer Army Being Established"] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, Conservative Party [CP] 
leader and Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] 
co- chairman, told PATRIOT this week that the national army 
being assembled countrywide will be the defense force for a new 
Afrikaner People's Republic. Dr. Hartzenberg was reacting to 
the announcement that the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], 
which is not recognized by the CP and the AVF, took the first 
step this week to establish a communist-controlled National 
Peace-keeping Force as a "single" defense force for all of South 
Africa. He said that the Afrikaner People's Republic, in the 
process of being established, would have to appoint its own 
security services. This means its own national army, its own 
police force, as well as other necessary security services which 
will be responsible for safeguarding the people's republic. The 
people's republic will have its own civil service, tax system, 
and control structures. There is no way key state departments 
of the people's republic will be entrusted to a future ANC 
[African National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] 
government. 
<H5>  Freedom at All Costs </H5>
  Dr. Hartzenberg emphasized that the Afrikaner people will 
get 
its freedom and will not be suppressed by any other nation or 
group. "If the people do not get their independence before 27 
April, then the independence process for the Afrikaners and 
other patriots who align themselves with the internationally 
accepted principle of self-determination for nations and for the 
Boer-Afrikaners, will have to be quickly realized." 
<H5>  Effective Steps </H5>
  PATRIOT has been informed that definite steps have been 
taken 
over the past week to bring about an Afrikaner People's 
Republic. The enemy of the Boer Afrikaner people, still denying 
them their right to self-determination, will have to decide if 
they want lasting peace with the "peaceful Boer nation" or if 
they want to engage in a struggle. If they choose the struggle, 
then they will have to deal with probably the most formidable 
freedom fighters in the world. In other words, the atheists and 
communists who are going to get South Africa served on a tray on 
27 April by the outgoing National Party, should urgently decide 
if they want to give the Afrikaner people their right to 
self-determination in its own people's republic before the 27 
April, and thus allow the election to proceed peacefully, or if 
they want to make South Africa the venue for the world's most 
dangerous freedom struggle. If the enemy of the Afrikaner 
people should choose a struggle, then they will find that they 
have chosen the most difficult opponent imaginable. 
<H5>  Warning </H5>
  Dr. Willie Snyman, the CP's spokesman on defense, has issued 
an urgent warning to all white members of the SADF [South 
African Defense Force] and the SAP [South African Police] to 
decide now if they want to join the Afrikaner people's army or 
whether they want to serve the communist-controlled atheistic 
Azanian government who will control part of the country on 27 
April. He says that the Boer Afrikaner people are irrevocably 
committed to freedom and a government in its own fatherland, and 
to the complete service of God in that territory. 
<H5>  Unpractical </H5>
  General Constand Viljoen, chairman of the Directorate of 
Generals of the AVF, says that the AVF has always regarded the 
TEC structures as redundant and as a waste of money. The 
command structures of the SADF and the SAP should not be touched 
because these organizations are the only ones standing between 
anarchy and a manageable stability in the country. General 
Viljoen says that the TEC's peace-keeping force is merely a 
"political necessity." The force, consisting of 3,000 members, 
equipped with special uniforms and vehicles, still has to be 
approved and trained. It takes approximately 75 days to 
assemble and train such a force, at great expense. Without any 
practical experience and with only 3,000 members it is too small 
to really exercise any influence, according to General Viljoen.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] One of the key leaders of the newly emerged African 
Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), Dr Johan van der Westhuizen, 
has a long record of running front organisations for Military 
Intelligence [MI]. 
  Van der Westhuizen confirmed this week that the ACDP had 
approached Local Government and Planning Minister Tertius 
Delport, known as a hardliner in President F.W. de Klerk's 
cabinet, to join the party's leadership. 
  Delport has denied he was about to resign from the National 
Party [NP] to join the ACDP, saying it was a community-based 
party that could play a positive role in local government 
elections. Delport [word indistinct] on "like minded parties to 
join forces against the African National Congress" [ANC] [word 
indistinct] Westhuizen, whose house is being used as the 
headquarters of the new party, [words indistinct] in mobilising 
anti-ANC blacks since 1986 when he was an official of the MI 
front organisation Adult Education Consultants (known as AdEd), 
which spent more than R[rand]150-million of taxpayers' money on 
secret projects aimed at undermining the ANC and its internal 
allies. 
  Before that, Van der Westhuizen and Delport were colleagues 
at the University of Port Elizabeth, [UPE], at the time an 
Afrikaner Broederbond [Afrikaner brotherhood] stronghold. Van 
der Westhuizen said the new party had no links with his MI past. 
"I haven't even talked to those guys for many years," he said. 
  AdEd Consultants was set up in 1986 by Dr Louis Pasques, a 
Pretoria educationist awarded the Star of Africa in 1987 by ex- 
president P.W. Botha for "service to state security". It 
spawned a host of other front organisations across the country. 
One of these was the close corporation Laborel in Johannesburg, 
of which Van der Westhuizen was the frontman. 
  A hallmark of many of Pasques' organisations was the use of 
the word "Christian" in their names, hiding their political 
motivation behind purportedly charitable and religious work. 
Most of these fell under the South African Christian Cultural 
Organisation (SACCO), also founded by Pasques. SACCO's secret 
and state-funded activities were exposed by the MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN 
last year. 
  The purpose of these "Christian cultural organisations" was 
to lecture "moderates" in the coloured and black communities on 
the "total onslaught on the country". Although most of the 
organisations did some legitimate work to hide their covert 
activities, they were largely sponsored by the South African 
Defence Force from secret state funds. 
  As AdEd consultants' research manager, Van der Westhuizen 
was 
directly involved in its covert work. According to a letter 
written by Pasques in June 1986 and addressed to Dr Das Herbst 
of the Ministry of Defence, Van der Westhuizen and his wife were 
behind a youth organisation in Port Elizabeth which was 
established with the express purpose of opposing the ANC-aligned 
UDF [United Democratic Front]. 
  Van der Westhuizen was also personally involved in giving 
political instruction to 200 members of Inkatha secretly trained 
by the SADF [South African Defence Force] in Namibia in 1986. 
  AdEd also helped Allan Hendrickse's Labour Party win three 
by- elections through weekend seminars in Cape Town in 1987. 
SADF - printed certificates were awarded to Labour Party 
organisers who successfully completed the electioneering course. 
The idea behind the seminars was apparently to boost the 
coloured vote to give legitimacy to the discredited tricameral 
system. 
  Front companies were at the time used by MI to create, 
train, 
support, assist and advise "moderate" black organisations which 
they believed would undermine the ANC. These included the black 
consciousness AmaAfrica organisation of the reverend Ebenezer 
Maqina in Port Elizabeth. AmaAfrica was directly involved in 
violent attacks on ANC supporters. The friendship between Van 
der Westhuizen and Delport goes back to the mid-1980s when both 
were lecturing at the University of Port Elizabeth. Delport was 
dean of the law faculty while Van der Westhuizen was a senior 
lecturer in political studies at UPF. 
  Questions about the extend of Delport's involvement in 
secret 
government projects at the time remain unanswered. He is 
implicated in documents released last year by Transkei military 
ruler General Bantu Holomisa, but no direct evidence of his 
involvement has been produced. 
  Delport's name is mentioned in a letter written by Brigadier 
CP ("Joffel") van der Westhuizen dated June 13 1986, marked "top 
secret" and addressed to the chief of the army. The letter 
deals with a plan relating to "stability and state security" in 
the Eastern Cape, and concludes that an alternative must be 
found for unsuccessful efforts to activate "pro-RSA [Republic of 
South Africa] resistance movements". 
  A "Professor Delport, Dean UPE Faculty of Law", is 
identified 
by Van der Westhuizen as one of three people who were "partly" 
aware of the plan. The other two are military men -- General 
Gleeson (SADF Deputy Commander) and General Van Deventer (Ciskei 
Ambassador). 
  This week Drickus Botha, a former Armscor [Armaments 
Corporation of South Africa] employee who was also an official 
of AdEd, denied that he and Delport were involved in "Operation 
Grammet", launched in Port Elizabeth in the mid-1980s and 
described by an insider as "war games". The exact nature of 
Grammet is not clear. 
  Botha until recently headed an AdEd front organisation in 
Pretoria, registered as MMD Makealaars. Another former Armscor 
employee, Peet du Preez, has been implicated in Operation 
Grammet. He could not be contacted for comment. 
  The ACDP which was launched in December by Van der 
Westhuizen, says it is strongly federalist and believes that 
participation in the transition is the most effective way of 
achieving its goals. since its inception it has embarked on a 
membership drive, trying to attack what it believes to be a 
massive constituency of undecided Christians. It was launched 
in Natal this week. 
  According to reports, Delport was disillusioned with the 
NP's 
weak stand on federalism and local government and was seeking a 
new political home. He was due to attend a meeting of the ACDP 
recently, but pulled out at the last moment. In his press 
statement on Monday, Delport emphasised that voters who 
supported the same principles as the NP, but who for historical 
or other reasons were not ready to support the party, were not 
political enemies of the NP. He said he had no intention of 
resigning from the NP and stated his unequivocal support for the 
NP and its leader, F.W. de Klerk. 
  In political circles the establishment of the ACDP is seen 
as 
a panic reaction by NP-supporting whites now that it has become 
clear that the party is unable to make significant inroads into 
the black community. Many NP members believe the decision not 
to change the party's name as part of a strategy to actively 
recruit black members was a fatal mistake. De Klerk, according 
to observers, did not want to allow a name-change out of fear of 
losing existing white support. 
  He believed the NP could still solicit strong black support. 
This belief was echoed by the NP's election chief, Olaus van 
Zyl, who at an NP press conference in Pretoria on Wednesday 
argued that his party would still make huge inroads into black 
communities once its message became clear. 
  However, a survey carried out in November and December last 
year by the Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC] indicates the 
opposite. Black support for the NP has dropped steadily from 
July 1992 and is currently at about one percent. Comment the 
HSRC pollsters: "The fall from the NP's seven to eight percent 
level of support in late 1992 to the October-November 1993 level 
suggests a loss of around a million African votes -- by far the 
biggest element in the NP's decline over the period." 
  The survey confirms serious doubts within NP circles about 
the party's ability to stop the ANC from achieving a landslide 
victory at the polls. NP officials are worried that the ANC may 
win an outright two-thirds majority, which will allow it to 
rewrite the transitional constitution without opposition. 
  Some cabinet members support the idea of an alliance with 
homeland parties like the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], 
Gazankulu's Ximoko [Whip of the Nation] Party and QwaQwa's 
Dikwankwetla [strong] Party. The problem is that these parties, 
with the exception of the IFP, command very little popular 
support.

  [Text] Five different types of identity documents will be 
acceptable for the 27 April election. The Home Affairs 
Department says the green ID card issued in 1950, the blue ID 
document issued since 1972, all green ID's issued since 1980, 
reference books issued to blacks since 1950, and ID's issued by 
the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states are 
acceptable. The department has requested that those already in 
possession of a valid ID not apply for a new document at this 
stage because it might delay the provision of valid documents to 
those who need it for the April poll.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  `Shocking' Black Exam Pass Rate -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN 
in English on 13 January in its page 6 editorial comments on the 
"shocking" 38.3 percent pass rate of black students in the final 
matriculation examinations. There are the "usual 
recriminations" with the African National Congress (ANC) blaming 
the Department of Education and Training for "failing to 
'provide the most basic education facilities'." THE CITIZEN 
agrees that blacks schools generally "are not as good as White 
schools, nor is Black teaching in the main as good as White 
teaching." Nevertheless, "when pupils burn down classrooms in 
Black schools in political protests, or headmasters are 
assaulted and chased out of schools, when teachers engage in 
chalkdowns and pupils stay away from school, Black education is 
bound to suffer." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Minerals Policy To Win Popular Support -- "Are the 
changes to mineral rights ownership proposed as part of the 
ANC's overall economic policy devised to win popular support 
rather than to contribute to an effective restructuring of the 
economy?" asks a page 4 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY 
in English on 14 January. The ANC "still has to express an 
"unequivocal economic policy." Its debate later this month 
"must produce a coherent policy if uncertainty over its 
intentions is not to deter investment." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Blacks, Whites Train Together in SADF -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN 
in English on 14 January in a page 8 editorial welcomes the 
South African Defense Force changeover to volunteer enlistment, 
"allowing blacks and whites to do basic training together." 
"While the army previously had more credibility than other 
security forces, an army that is representative of all the 
people will have more credibility. It will also be able to use 
the skills of many more young people." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  ANC Election Lists Show Internal Democracy -- Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 14-20 January in a 
page 14 
editorial comments on the ANC's regional nomination election 
lists saying they demonstrated "internal democracy and openness 
in the ANC's handling of its lists. This was a bottom-up 
process -- the lists were generated by ANC supporters and not by 
party leaders handing out favours." "No other party has shown 
such internal democracy and transparency. It augurs well for 
the ANC's ability to limit future corruption and patronage." 
  ANC, Police At Fault in Katlehong Shootings Incident -- A 
second editorial on the same page comments on the ANC leaders' 
visit to Katlehong on 9 January, and the ensuing shootings, 
saying that although the ANC had "every right to be in 
Katlehong" they "acted irresponsibly" because they knew of the 
dangers facing their charges. They should have had a 
bullet-proof car at the ready, and when the shooting started 
Ramaphosa and Slovo should have been thrown to the ground, and 
their bodies covered by those of their bodyguards. "Not 
informing the SAP [South African Police] of the delegation's 
movements was irresponsible too. Whatever the ANC's view on the 
presence of the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] in the townships, 
the SAP had a role to play in securing the visit and should have 
been informed of its details. Playing pass the buck may gather 
a few votes, but it could cost lives." However, the SAP 
response that it was not informed of the visit "was a typical 
whine, ignoring the force's responsibilities under the law." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Need for Media Freedom To Report -- Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 11 January says in a page 10 editorial the 
Katlehong shooting on 9 January highlighted the fact that "the 
SAP and the political parties dare not pull in opposite 
directions where security is involved. They owe it to the 
country to protect the political process." BEELD does "not 
accept that the ANC was simply being provocative by visiting 
Katlehong. It has the right to convey its message, just as the 
National Party [NP] has the right to preach its message in 
Soweto. That is the kind of freedom we need to strive for in 
this country." 
  ANC Education Plans Too Costly -- A second editorial on page 
10 of BEELD says: "The ANC is skating on thin ice with its 
ideas on a new educational system for a new South Africa. The 
cost implications of its plans seem to be unaffordably high. It 
is true that its ideas for a new educational system are not 
entirely new. Many of them even have merit. But to actually 
consider free and compulsory education for the first 9 years for 
all, and to want to place all schools back under state control, 
sounds half-baked. Education is only one of the areas where 
affirmative action must take place. But the cost of the ANC's 
education plan will be so enormous that it will swallow up the 
country's whole budget." Fortunately, this is not a final plan. 
BEELD believes the ANC is "testing the water." 
  Editorial Urges Parties Too Unite Against ANC -- According 
to 
the latest poll, argues an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 12 January, "a two-thirds majority in the 
election is well within the ANC's reach, which means the 
organization will be able to put its stamp more completely on 
the final constitution," which "would not be in South Africa's 
best interests. A check is needed on the organization, 
especially because there are some dangerous aspects in ANC 
policy which will have to be removed through struggle and 
negotiation." "According to figures, the NP remains the only 
broad, countrywide movement which will be able to stand up to 
the ANC. It seems the NP has reached its low point and has 
started growing again. So the contest is far from over." BEELD 
advises "parties with sufficient common ground" to "get 
together." 
  Crack in Freedom Alliance To Grow -- A second editorial on 
the same page of BEELD welcomes the Ciskei decision to 
participate in the Transitional Executive Council. "This crack 
in the boycott attitude of the Freedom Alliance can only grow. 
It has been caused by more than simple increasing political 
realism. Subjects of Brig. Gqozo insisted that Ciskei become 
part of the legitimate reform process, or they would be left out 
of new structures like the National Peacekeeping Force. The 
same internal pressures will in the days ahead be experienced in 
kwaZulu and Bophuthatswana. The latest survey indicates that 
Inkatha is losing support in its home ground, Natal-kwaZulu. 
Hopefully the leaders of not only Inkatha, but other members of 
the alliance, will realize that they cannot stop the march to 
democracy. The overwhelming majority of South Africans want to, 
and are going to, vote with their hands and feet for 
participation in the new South Africa."

  [Text] There were no direct talks between the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] yesterday. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special 
representative in Angola, is today expected to organize another 
face-to-face meeting between the Angolan delegations which are 
searching for peace. 
  At the meeting the parties will once again discuss political 
issues connected with the formation of the national police. Of 
the 12 interrelated points, the national police formation is 
viewed as one of the most complicated issues in this second 
round of talks, because the end of the riot police -- the main 
cause of the present war -- depends on it. UNITA has already 
demanded the dissolution of the riot police. UNITA and the 
MPLA-PT have already reached agreement on half of the 12 main 
points presented by the mediators. 
  Yesterday, Alioune Blondin Beye once again called on the two 
delegations from UNITA and the MPLA-PT to respect the game rules 
and the press blackout [preceding word in English]. Alioune 
Blondin Beye said there is a flight of information.

  [Text] Prime Minister Marcolino Moco today granted an 
audience to Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina. The 
two officials discussed the need for strengthening the ties that 
have linked Angola and Cuba for several decades. Cuban Foreign 
Minister Robaina is visiting this country within the framework 
of a diplomatic offensive which his government launched a few 
months ago. The Cuban official noted that it is not enough that 
the two peoples should know and understand each other, adding 
that they must also seek to cooperate as advantageously as 
possible. The audience was also attended by Angolan Foreign 
Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura and the Cuban ambassador to 
Angola. 
  Official bilateral talks began this afternoon. Roberto 
Robaina, who arrived in the Angolan capital this morning on his 
first official visit to this country in his capacity as Cuban 
foreign affairs minister, had already carried out part of his 
program before midday: He held a private meeting with Venancio 
de Moura, his Angolan counterpart and he visited the Cuban 
doctors at the Military Hospital. He and his team began 
official talks with their Angolan counterparts at the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry this afternoon. They discussed the internal 
situation in Angola and Cuba, bilateral friendship and 
cooperation ties, and the international situation but, before 
doing so, they delivered long speeches. Angolan Foreign Minister 
Venancio de Moura spoke first: 
  [Begin Moura recording] After the talks we had this morning 
concerning the internal situation in our countries, we found we 
are motivated to do everything in our power to ensure that we 
continue working together to overcome the insufficiencies and 
difficulties our peoples and governments are facing at this 
stage. Those difficulties have often arisen from hostile 
behavior toward our countries. [end recording] 
  In turn, the Cuban foreign affairs minister attached special 
significance to his diplomatic offensive in Africa, where he is 
on a tour of several countries. Minister Robaina noted that this 
was particularly the case in the context of the very complex and 
constantly changing world we live in. He added that in Cuba one 
cannot talk about a diplomatic offensive without mentioning 
Africa, a continent with which Cuba has long standing historic 
relations. 
  [Begin Robaina recording] To my country -- and, I suppose, 
to 
Angola, too -- diplomacy at this stage means finding paths, 
opening doors, and finding solutions to our problems. We must 
seek advantageous cooperation and think along the lines that 
what might be a necessity to one side, might also be an 
opportunity for the other side to [word indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina is expected 
to 
wind up his visit to Angola tomorrow. Among other commitments, 
he is scheduled to call on President of the Republic Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos.

  [Text] The international press revealed yesterday that the 
Luanda government is planning a major offensive against the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], 
using modern deadly sophisticated war materiel received from 
Brazil, Argentina, and the DPRK. Now, there are reports of a 
new massive invasion of Angola by powerfully equipped Cuban 
soldiers who are already in Luanda, under the cover of civil 
servants and businessmen. Eduardo dos Santos counts on these 
soldiers to carry out its military adventures against 
UNITA-controlled areas in northern, northeastern, and central 
Angola. 
  This is a clear violation of the New York Accords of 
December 
1988, under which all Cuban soldiers should leave Angola by May 
1991, within the framework of the independence of Namibia. 
  What is more, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived 
in Luanda yesterday [as heard]. According to the Futungo de 
Belas Palace, he is in Luanda to strengthen historical relations 
of friendship and solidarity between Cuba and Angola and discuss 
the possibility of strengthening relations in various fields, 
including exchanging information. 
  The Havana government invaded Angola in 1975 and imposed on 
the Angolan people the Communist and dictatorial government of 
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party. 
Accordingly, the visit to Angola by Roberto Robaina is simply 
aimed at inspecting the return of Cuban soldiers to Angola to 
bring more deaths to the martyred Angolan people.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "The lies that are broadcast by Jamba's Voice </F>
of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, radio station" 
on the "Dotting the I's, Crossing the T's" section of the "Voice 
of Resistance of the Black Cockerel" program] 
  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] radical wing's Voice of the Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel, Vorgan, radio station has its studios in Jamba, 
in the jungle. Recently it opened its 2000 news service with 
the announcement -- as though it were true -- that General Kundi 
Paiama was dead. General Kundi Paiama is an adviser to General 
Joao de Matos, Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] chief of General 
Staff. In that broadcast, the UNITA radical wing's official 
radio station proceeded to make defamatory remarks about General 
Paiama, even blaming him for many of the reverses that the UNITA 
warmongering wing has suffered in its terrorist operations. 
  All those who listened to that news item will have noticed 
that the announcer read it with joy in his voice, noting that 
General Paiama had been one of the key figures in the Ministry 
of State Security, Minse, and the Directorate of Intelligence 
and Security of Angola, DISA. That lie, along with many others 
we have grown used to hearing from Vorgan, clearly shows that 
the propaganda personnel in the UNITA militarist wing are 
becoming desperate. The jungle-based Vorgan radio station 
newsmen are so worried about projecting a negative image of the 
working of state organs in government-controlled areas in 
general and in the Angolan capital in particular, that they do 
not care how they fill their radio programs. The proof is that 
they are always lying about incidents that have never taken take 
place. Furthermore, they seldom quote sources, thereby 
providing undeniable evidence that Jamba's Vorgan radio station 
can only survive on lies. This, in turn, has been reducing the 
number of its listeners, because only the truth can ennoble a 
radio station and make it more widely heard. 
  The UNITA warmongering wing's radio station would have given 
the public much better service if it tried to report on the real 
tragedy facing hundreds of Angolans being held captive in 
UNITA-controlled areas in general, and in the Jamba base in 
particular. Today, more than ever before, we are hearing those 
false correspondents' reports to which we grew accustomed when 
we were in Jamba. The so-called correspondent would be sent 
into a room, where he was issued with a poorly tuned recorder, 
and then he had to shout into it a text cooked up in a hurry by 
people such as [UNITA Information Secretary] Jorge Valentim and 
company, at the end of which he would say: this was such and 
such, reporting from Huambo. First, that such and such was not 
in Huambo and, second, that is not his right name. Those are 
ploys to which Vorgan resorts to give the impression that it is 
on top of the situation. The reality, though, is that it is 
not. We are only too well aware of its tricks. We were there 
and we even participated in some of that trickery. We will not 
be fooled by anybody. 
  We saw poor Amos, who is also known as Bob, and whose duty 
is 
to listen to other radio stations, doing the job of 
correspondent in the room next to where he works. We saw the 
wretched Carlos, a white man who uses the pseudonym of 
(Catjabala), trying to pass as the station's correspondent in 
Bie. The truth is that the poor man -- who could not be treated 
with more contempt for the simple reason that he was white -- 
used to run a small storehouse with corn, grain, and dry fish 
and never imagined he would one day become a radio 
correspondent. We also met (Lolo), that unfortunate soul who 
comes from central Angola and reports under the name of 
(Cassembo). He is used to working with generators and sometimes 
with cameras, but there he was trying to be the Moxico Province 
correspondent in a cubicle in the Jamba Vorgan radio station's 
premises. We got to know quite well all those so-called 
correspondents. They are forced to read whatever is put in 
front of them. Woe betide if they fail to do so. 
  What is quite certain is that the Angolan people are not 
very 
patient. Yesterday, it was Savimbi who claimed he was hitting 
the enemy in the face. Now it is he who is getting the blows -- 
and how! Yesterday, it was Savimbi who filled up his lungs to 
shout: [words indistinct] becoming ugly! Now, his chest quite 
deflated, it is he who is beginning to see things become ugly 
for him. The Vorgan radio station should be carrying reports 
from Savimbi- controlled areas where many people are held 
captive. Above all, they should go around interviewing the 
inhabitants of those areas, but without resorting to any sort of 
coercion. Jonas Savimbi's radio station should also be 
encouraging debate and it should call on the UNITA militarist 
wing to follow the path of democracy and to demilitarize its 
army. 
  It is easy to see that there is much that the Jamba Vorgan 
radio station could be doing instead of spreading lies. General 
Kundi Paiama is alive, well, and kicking. He is healthy enough 
to give his contribution to peace in Angola. 
  One cannot report on the basis of lies. One must report on 
the basis of concrete facts.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] is exerting pressure on almost every district in 
Cuanza Sul Province to destabilize them economically and 
subsequently to occupy them militarily. Our correspondent 
reports. 
  Cuanza Sul Provincial Governor Ramos da Cruz has described 
the situation as very delicate and said UNITA has two objectives 
-- to economically destabilize every area in the province and 
subsequently to occupy them. 
  [Begin Cruz recording] The military situation in the 
province 
is very delicate. UNITA has exerted pressure on almost every 
district in the province in an attempt to destabilize and occupy 
them. It plans to fully destabilize the coastal region so that 
it can use Cuanza Sul Province as a launching pad to carry out 
attacks on Angola's northern provinces, particularly Luanda. 
[end recording] 
  Ramos da Cruz said there is an urgent and imperative need 
for 
the government to organize its entire defensive perimeter. 
  [Begin Cruz recording] During 1994 the government should 
continue to organize its entire defensive perimeter, improve 
administrative work, create minimum living conditions for our 
people, and try to begin a counteroffensive so that we can 
gradually regain control of the entire province and thus achieve 
our main objective -- to stabilize Cuanza Sul Province and make 
it one of the provinces where the government has complete 
territorial administration. [end recording]

  [Text] An Angolan official has visited the southern British 
port of Plymouth to inspect an impounded German freighter 
carrying weapons bound for the southern African country. The 
representative of the Angolan Embassy in London has expressed 
concern that more than 20 tanks with artillery pieces on board 
were for rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] forces. The UNITA rebels are currently waging war to 
oust the elected government of Angolan President Jose Eduardo 
Dos Santos. 
  On Wednesday customs officials making a routine check of the 
freighter (Nora Hiren) discovered the arms hidden under 
tarpaulin. The ship's cargo was declared as farm equipment. The 
Angolan representative says he will be making a full report to 
brief the Angolan Government on the situation. A British 
Foreign Office spokesman says there is no embargo on the export 
of arms to the Angolan government, but one is in effect on UNITA 
forces. Officials, however, say it is unclear if the weapons are 
for UNITA or the Angolan Government army.

  [Text] Gaborone Jan 13 SAPA -- Botswana's full membership 
of the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade has been described 
as a major step in creating an attractive long-run investment 
climate in the country, Botswana Press Association reported from 
Gaborone on Thursday. Acting permanent secretary in the Ministry 
of Commerce and Industry, Vincent Selato, said Botswana had 
completed the formal procedures to join GATT and accepted the 
obligations of membership last month. 
  Mr Selato said Botswana would now receive all benefits of 
the 
information and analysis of world trade developments prepared by 
the GATT secretariat. 
  Full membership indicated to other trading partners and 
investors that Botswana was now prepared to take a full role and 
obligations in developing its new trade policy, Mr Selato said. 
"This message will be important for foreign investors who may 
wish to establish in Botswana to supply foreign markets and 
utilise foreign intellectual property and services". 
  About the possible impact of joining GATT on the local 
textile industry, Mr Selato said the formal accession to GATT 
would have no impact on the competitive position of the textile 
industry, since Botswana was already subject to GATT obligations 
through Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and South Africa's 
membership in GATT. 
  He said the conclusion of the current GATT negotiations 
might 
have some impact on the textile industry in two ways: 
  -- firstly, many of the clothing exports from Botswana to 
non-SACU countries arose because low cost producers in other 
countres were limited by quotas from exporting more to European 
and North American markets. 
  "The GATT negotiations initiated a process to phase out 
these 
quotas and replace them with general tarrifs in the importing 
countries", he said. He added that when this happens the low 
cost producers "will again be able to ship unlimited amounts to 
those countries, and will compete very strongly with Botswana's 
exports". 
  -- Secondly, the new GATT agreement would probably involve 
some lowering of tariffs on textile and clothing imports into 
the SACU region depending upon the outcome of last minute 
negotiations between GATT members and South Africa. "This may 
also lead to additional competition within the SACU market for 
local producers. In the short term, GATT membership will mean 
very little to the small man. 
  "Over a longer period of time, however, the more secure 
access to foreign makets, including those in SACU, should lead 
to more investment, more employment, a higher rate of income 
growth and a more secure level of income for the small man. 
  "It will take time for the benefits of Gatt memberhip to 
mature". He said local business would continue to have the 
protection of SACU tarrif against large foreign companies 
outside the SACU. "Although this tarrif will be lowered to some 
degree as a result of the current GATT negotiations, it will 
still provide very substantial protection. 
  "Ultimately, the best protection against large foreign 
companies is to improve productivity through better training, 
more efficient work practices and more modern technology and 
management. 
  "Lower costs and improved quality of output are the only 
real 
protection for local businesses". 
  Mr Selato said all Botswana's major trading partners 
including those in the SACU were already GATT members.

  [Text] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN 
secretary general, said a few moments ago that he does not know 
why the government has practically stopped confining its troops. 
This issue will be discussed during a meeting of the 
Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] early next week. 
  Ajello said the only information he possesses is that 
government forces say they have not received orders to go to 
confinement centers. Only 19.6 percent of troops from the 
government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] have 
been confined so far. Only 14,557 weapons from both forces have 
been collected so far. 
  Meanwhile, militia and irregular forces are now being 
disarmed throughout the country. The process began in Maputo 
where 345 weapons have already been collected. 
  Regarding the confinement process, Aldo Ajello feels the 
main 
problem is a lack of discipline on the part of the soldiers who 
do not want to obey local officials and can only receive orders 
from the central organs. As a result, salary problems are not 
resolved and there are logistical problems in confinement 
centers. 
  On the training of the new armed forces, Ajello said Italy 
has given the $500,000 necessary to repair training centers. 
The 540 military instructors, recently trained in Zimbabwe, 
returned to the country yesterday. They are presently at the 
Dondo Military Training Center which has already been repaired. 
  It is expected that before the end of January, 2,500 men 
from 
the government and an equal number from Renamo will be selected 
to form the first infantry battalions of the new Mozambican 
army. The two sides are studying the possibility of soldiers 
choosing to join the new army to go directly to training centers 
from their barracks and bases, without passing through 
confinement centers. 
  Ajello also revealed that a project is under study to 
increase from six months to 18 or 24 months the granting of 
salaries to the soldiers that are going to be demobilized. This 
project will only be possible with the assistance of the 
international community.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama meets with Aldo Ajello, special representative 
of the UN secretary general in Mozambique, today. According to 
MEDIAFAX, Dhlakama wants to be informed about several pending 
issues in the Mozambican peace process. The Renamo leader wants 
to hear from Ajello, among other things, what the international 
community's response on financing promises is, the 
transformation of his movement into a political party, the 
sending of the UN police contingent to Mozambique, and the 
provision of houses in provinces for Renamo cadres and advisers. 
Dhlakama held a meeting yesterday with the Mozambique Episcopal 
Council, made up of Maputo Cardinal Don Alexandre Maria dos 
Santos, Beira Archbishop Don Jaime Goncalves, Nampula Archbishop 
Don Manuel Vieira Pinto, and Chimoio Bishop Don Francisco Silota.

  [Text] (Maputo) The 10 unarmed opposition parties met in 
the Mozambican capital last night to decide on reconfirming 
Inacio Bento as candidate to the post of Elections 
Administration Technical Secretariat, STAE, assistant director. 
Bento was reconfirmed with five votes in favor, one abstention, 
and four votes against. 
  The "yes" vote is due to the fact that it has been 
established that he has returned his Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] Party membership card. It is worth noting, however, 
that Engineer Inacio Bento only gave up his Frelimo Party 
membership card on 11 January, the day after he had been 
selected by the opposition. MEDIAFAX learned this yesterday from 
Hermenegildo Infante, head of the Frelimo Party Central 
Committee Mobilization and Propaganda Department. According to 
that source, Inacio Bento delivered his membership severance 
letter by hand to an official of the Registry Department, in the 
Frelimo Central Committee headquaters, at 1030 on 11 January. 
In his letter, Bento alleged that he had never done any 
specific work within the Frelimo Party and he added that he had 
been neither a relevant nor an effective member, but the head of 
the mobilization and propaganda department said that Inacio's 
allegations are false because he had done work of some 
responsibility in the Frelimo Party cell at the National 
Hycarbon Company, ENH. Hermenegildo Infante further noted that 
Bento should have surrendered his severance letter at the party 
cell committee at ENH and that he had been "dishonest" when he 
claimed to have done so "a long time ago." Bento's letter 
carries the date of 20 December, but was only received at the 
Frelimo Central Committee Registry Department on 11 January. 
  Our source in the Frelimo Party said that his party's 
statutes grant members the right to renounce their membership. 
According to Infante, not many do so, but "there are some who 
desert" the party. He added that in Niassa Province, for 
instance, there were some "desertions" in mid-1993.

  [Text] Troops from the government and the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] recently trained by British 
instructors in Nyanga, Zimbabwe, returned to the country 
yesterday. They are presently at the Dondo Military Training 
Center in Sofala Province. Our correspondent Matias dos Amores 
reports. 
  The 540 military instructors will train soldiers selected 
from the government and Renamo armies to form units of the new 
Mozambique armed forces, within the framework of the peace 
process in the country. The Mozambican instructors who 
travelled to Mozambique by road in UN vehicles, left the Nyanga 
Military Training Center in Zimbabwe at 0730 [0530] yesterday 
and arrived at the Dondo Military Training Center at around 
1800. They were received by Lieutenant Generals Tobias Dai and 
Mateus Ngonyamo, heads of the government and Renamo delegations 
to the Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique 
Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM], respectively. 
  Lt. Gen. Tobias Dai said that with the end of the military 
training course, part of the General Peace Accord has been 
implemented. 
  [Begin Dai recording] Dear Mozambican finalists who have 
just 
concluded a military training course in Zimbabwe, on behalf of 
the Mozambican government and as head of the government 
delegation to the CCFADM, I would like, first of all, to thank 
the people who have come here, some from very far, to witness 
the arrival of Mozambican finalists from the Republic of 
Zimbabwe where they were being trained by British and Zimbabwean 
instructors. They have been here since this morning to see 
their brothers who have just returned to the fatherland. To you 
finalists, we say welcome to the fatherland, welcome to the 
Republic of Mozambique. We say welcome in particular to the 
Dondo Military Training Center which is the point of departure 
for you to begin carrying out your tasks. [end recording] 
  Renamo's Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonyamo said the presence of 
government and Renamo troops in Dondo, after concluding their 
military instruction course, marks the true steps toward 
national reconciliation. 
  [Begin Ngonyamo recording] For me, I view your arrival, as 
an 
implementation of the objectives of peace and reconciliation. 
As you can see, it is difficult to know who is the former 
soldier of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and who is 
the former Renamo soldier. Here, we see a unit of military 
instructors of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces. This is the 
foundation of our new army. We cannot have good units with good 
soldiers, without good military instructors. [end recording] 
  Mateus Ngonyamo called on Mozambican politicians to follow 
the example of the soldiers in the process of national 
reconciliation, having guaranteed that despite [words 
indistinct] politicians, the Angolan situation will not be 
repeated in our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Garcia Bires, Angolan ambassador to </F>
Namibia, by Graham Hopwood; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Hopwood] The present Lusaka talks are taking a 
long time to produce results. Doe you think that real progress 
is being made and will the talks lead to a lasting peace? 
  [Bires] The talks have now restarted and according to the 
agenda are going to discuss the political spectrum. I believe 
that the discussions will take some more time. If there is good 
faith from UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] the results will be favourable. We don't have a set 
time to end the negotiations. We want to discuss in a very 
serious way as we don't want misinterpretations of the agreement 
we eventually reach. So it will take time -- it's not a problem 
for us. We want the peace to be lasting of course and that will 
benefit the Frontline States and the SADC [South African 
Development Coordination] countries. 
  [Hopwood] The UN special representative has appealed to both 
sides not to launch attacks while the talks are ongoing. What 
is the government's position on this? 
  [Bires] We are on the defensive (militarily) to facilitate 
humanitarian aid to different parts of the country. There is no 
need for Angolans to die while we are discussing a lasting 
peace. It's very unfortunate that UNITA launched some attacks in 
Bengo, Cuando Cubango and both north and south Lunda provinces 
and at Malanje and Cabinda. Naturally the government has the 
right to defend itself. 
  [Hopwood] It has been claimed that the Angolan government 
has 
requested a South African company to supply former SADF [South 
African Defense Force] soldiers to help the army? As far as you 
know is there any truth in the company (Executive Outcomes) 
claims? 
  [Bires] It's not true -- because the Angolan armed forces 
were formed according to the principles in the Bicesse agreement 
(the 1991 Angolan peace accord). There are former UNITA 
elements in the army, even commanders who were UNITA. If we had 
foreigners in the army we would be denounced. Today we are 
capable of forming an army without foreign support -- except in 
the fields of logistics, the navy and the air force. 
  [Hopwood] Is any aid to UNITA in the form of material goods 
and personnel passing through Namibia on its way to the UNITA 
strongholds? 
  [Bires] I don't believe that. I don't think that Namibian 
soil is being used as a transition place for aid to UNITA. The 
Namibian government is taking measures to avoid weapons being 
directed to Angola and is enforcing the sanctions adopted by the 
UN Security Council. 
  It is true that UNITA is receiving support from the 
extremist 
rightwing in South Africa via Zaire -- there is evidence of 
that. That is why UNITA is putting its vehicles and weapons in 
the north of the country and on the eastern border. They cannot 
gain such aid through the South. It was after the independence 
of Namibia that Savimbi chose Zaire to launch atrocities inside 
the country. As you can see Malanje, Lunda north and south and 
Zaire province itself are near Zaire. Further south in Cuando 
Cubango and Bie provinces there is not a lot of pressure 
compared to the areas near Zaire. 
  [Hopwood] Is there concrete evidence of South African 
support? 
  [Bires] There are some coordinated rightwing groups in 
South Africa supplying aid -- those extremists who were fighting 
the ANC are the same who are continuing to give support to 
UNITA. There is hard evidence for instance of the violations of 
airspace and the presence of heavy artillery, armoured cars and 
other war material in the north. 
  Material that was in south-eastern Angola is now 
concentrated 
in the north of Angola. All of this cannot go through by land. 
It is being transferred by air. Airspace violations have been 
confirmed by Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. 
  [Hopwood] Is there evidence of mercenaries assisting UNITA? 
  [Bires] In the past we captured whites working with UNITA. 
Today there are still whites assisting UNITA in strategic 
areas. There is evidence that there are mercenaries -- there 
are reports from local people that they were attacked by whites. 
There are also Zairean mercenaries -- Lingala and French 
speakers among UNITA forces -- according to local people. 
  [Hopwood] Presuming there is a settlement could the 
government accept Jonas Savimbi taking up a position in a new 
coalition government? 
  [Bires] Let me clarify some things. There have been 
negotiations with UNITA for the government which came out of the 
multi-party elections. UNITA participated in multi-party 
meetings before the election took place. UNITA contributed to 
the constitution and the electoral law. So a coalition existed. 
UNITA won seventy seats in the National Assembly. 
  The discussions that are taking place now are seeking to 
create the necessary conditions for the second round of 
Presidential elections. That is the immediate objective. 
  According to the constitution and other laws if Mr. Savimbi 
is to be given a status he may be deserves, then it should be a 
compromise according to the legal system of the country and the 
wish of the Angolan government. 
  [Hopwood] How has the present war affected the embassy's 
efforts to promote economic, cultural and other ties between 
Namibians and Angolans? 
  [Bires] Of course war brings destabilisation to economic and 
cultural ties. Unfortunately the war is affecting the country 
-- reducing the economy and there is not much opportunity for 
both peoples to promote economic and cultural links. 
  Nevertheless there are very positive ongoing relations in 
some areas -- fisheries, public works and the Epupa project for 
example. These are some of the efforts being made by both 
governments. Once we get a relative peace there will be a 
qualitative jump forward in relations. 
  [Hopwood] How many Angolans are living in Namibia? Does the 
Embassy experience any problems with divisions in the Angolan 
community here, i.e. between UNITA and government supporters? 
  [Bires] There are many Angolans here -- hundreds and 
hundreds. It's not a phenomenen that results from the war, but 
from the movement of people between the south of Angola and the 
north of Namibia. 
  At the moment there are four different groups in the Angolan 
community here. The first group are those who voluntarily 
decided to stay in Namibia before Angolan independence. The 
second group is here through family connections. The third are 
those who came here in 1975 (after Angola's independence). And 
the fourth are those who are coming in from the 1980s until now. 
  We don't distinguish Angolans by political affiliation -- we 
simply treat all Angolans as Angolans. If they have a political 
role it is with their own parties and not with the Embassy. 
  In 1978 the then Angolan government opted for a policy of 
national reconciliation. After ten years elements belonging to 
the FNLA [Front for the National Liberation of Angola] became 
involved in the structures of government and other institutions. 
Some Angolans from different parties were offered posts in 
government as ministers and so on. And the there was the full 
opening after the Bicesse Accords. So that's why I emphasise 
there is no difference in being Angolans of UNITA, MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] or FNLA. 
  Of course there are fears. As an example UNITA has been 
refusing to transfer Angolan citizens from Jamba to Namibia for 
medical treatment. But we represent the Angolan government and 
are here to defend all Angolans. 
  [Hopwood] Do you think that the situation in Angola is 
getting enough international attention, especially compared with 
other world trouble spots such as Bosnia and Somalia. 
  [Bires] I don't think so -- what is going on in Angola is 
sometimes forgotten. The Bicesse agreements were reached 
because of the efforts of the UN and OAU. We have a special 
representative of UN Secretary General for Angola. Yet there 
was a lack of personnel, material and other aspects to direct a 
stable transition process. Our country is big -- some 1,246,000 
sq km. But the assistance programme that was prepared by the UN 
for Angola was ten times less than the assistance sent to 
Cambodia for instance. The humanitarian assistance for Angola 
is twenty times less than what is being sent to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The UN was supposed to play an important role, but nothing 
is 
being done at all. One thousand are dying daily -- the 
assistance is not sufficient. I do not think the international 
community has assumed its responsibility for Angola. 
  [Hopwood] Are you satisfied with the Namibian government's 
stance of neutrality on the Angolan conflict? 
  [Bires] Namibia has not taken a neutral attitude in 
classical terms. Until very recently Namibian soil was being 
used to send humanitarian aid to the Angolan people. In Namibia 
there have been a lot of workshops and conferences looking at 
Angolan issues. Blondin Beye (the UN special representative) was 
here to inform President Nujoma of the Angolan situation. I 
think the Namibian government is giving all moral and diplomatic 
support to the Angolan government -- which we appreciate very 
much. 
  Namibia is party to the efforts of the Frontline States. Our 
President was here recently to discuss Angola with President 
Nujoma and we asked for continued diplomatic and moral support. 
Namibia is being active in the application of sanctions against 
UNITA. 
  [Hopwood] Finally, there many obvious links which tie 
Namibians and Angolans together. What is your vision for future 
Angolan-Namibian cooperation? 
  [Bires] I think it will be a very dynamic cooperation. In 
terms of communications and road transport -- these are suitable 
areas for cooperation. We have a common coastline which is rich 
for fishing. We think the fishing industry can be an area for 
mutual cooperation between our two countries. Angola and 
Namibia can exchange experience in the mining of diamonds and 
copper. We have rivers bordering our two countries where 
various joint projects can be undertaken. The EC and the Nordic 
countries have expressed interest in using the Kunene river 
basin for various projects. In a time of peace we can change 
the physical spectrum of the sub-region.

  [Text] Lusaka Jan 14 SAPA -- Zambian Defence Minister Ben 
Mwila has warned of a military coup following the release by 
President Frederick Chiluba of the findings of an 
anti-corruption commission into corruption among ministers. Mr 
Mwila denied being the grandmaster of corruption in Zambia, and 
attacked the press as the cause of the breakdown of law and 
order. 
  Friday's edition of the independent weekly POST quoted him 
as 
saying forces working to destabilise the country could, if not 
checked, precipitate a military coup. 
  He criticised the press for encouraging the trend in 
lawlessness, recalcitrance, indiscipline and total disobedience 
to authority, saying: "You make dictators. Read the signs." 
The press had, he claimed, wrongfully published confidential 
presidential documents. "Zambian soldiers are not different from 
Zaireans, Ghanaians or Nigerian soldiers -- they too could blow 
up soon and take this country by force. Don't push us too far." 
  He rejected charges of corruption, saying he had nothing to 
gain from it. Mr Mwila warned Zambians to listen to him because 
the press was abusing its freedom and democracy was being turned 
into anarchy.

  [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has come under 
fire from another formerly staunch supporter. Zimbabwe's 
biggest daily newspaper, THE HERALD, has warned that other 
African states may follow Tanzania's lead. Tanzania this week 
barred the PAC from using its Dar es Salaam headquarters as a 
launching pad for violence attacks against South Africa. As 
Lawrence Bartlett reports, THE HERALD newspaper often reflects 
the thinking of President Robert Mugabe's government: 
  THE HERALD's criticism of the PAC is especially significant 
because Mugabe and Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African 
National Union -- Patriotic Front] party have historically had 
closer links to the PAC than to the ANC [African National 
Congress]. THE HERALD takes the line that what is calls the 
PAC's senseless violence threatens to disrupt South Africa's 
move toward democracy at a time when the goal of the liberation 
movements is within their grasp. It accuses the PAC of a 
misguided attempt to gain lost ground against the ANC in the run 
up to the election in April, saying its actions put it on much 
the same level as the militant extreme right wing in South 
Africa. The newspaper calls on the PAC to choose the ballot and 
not the bullet, or face the possibility of other former friends 
also taking action against it.

  [Text] It looks as if the Guinea-Bissau opposition leader, 
Joao da Costa, may escape a prison sentence altogether following 
a dramatic development of his trial on the charges of plotting a 
coup last year against the government of President Vieira. The 
trial began just over a week ago and da Costa and 16 others were 
in the dock. But today one of the main prosecution witnesses, 
an Army officer, took the stand to talk about the alleged plot, 
and the soldier's testimony came as something of a surprise, as 
Eduardo Lubao reports in this telex from Bissau for VOICES news 
agency: 
  Army Sub-Lieutenant Amadu Mane withdrew his accusations 
against Joao da Costa in a testimony today at the military court 
in Bisalanka outside the capital, Bissau. Mr. Mane said he had 
not met Joao da Costa for two years since the time when Mr. da 
Costa left the ruling PAIGC [African Party for the Independence 
of Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde] Party in order to form his own 
opposition party. He said the government security chief had 
persuaded him to falsely accuse Mr. da Costa of plotting a coup 
d'etat. 
  Mr. Mane, who is now an outspoken critic of poor conditions 
in the Army, explained how he had shot Major Obolo da Pino in 
March last year after da Pino has tried to kill him. Maj. Obolo 
da Pino was a close aide to President Nino Vieira and head of 
one of the Army's crack military units. Mane denied government 
charges that the killing was aimed at sparking off a mutiny 
against the government. He described how he fled abroad after 
the shooting, was captured in neighboring Gambia, and flown back 
to Bissau under military escort. 
  He said that the interior minister, Abubacar Balde; the 
director general of the government security services; the chief 
of the Presidency; and the commander of the Frontier Guard then 
persuaded him to accuse Joao da Costa of plotting a coup d'etat. 
Mane said they had told him several other arrested soldiers had 
already agreed to accuse Mr. da Costa of plotting a coup and 
that he would be freed after the trial if he went along with the 
story. 
  Last week, several other witnesses who appeared before the 
military court withdrew earlier accusations against Mr. da 
Costa, saying they had been obliged to sign false statements.

  [Excerpt] We return to the subject of the CFA franc in this 
second part of "Afrique Soir", following the devaluation decided 
at the end of the Dakar summit on Tuesday evening. The guest of 
this second part is President Alpha Oumar Konare, who thinks 
that this devaluation was unavoidable and that the African 
countries belonging to the franc zone should display more 
solidarity with each other from now on. Ghislaine Dupont first 
asked the Malian president if he agreed with the World Bank, 
which declared that the devaluation of the CFA franc could be 
beneficial to Mali: 
  [Begin recording] [Konare] It is certain that a devaluation 
includes positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects 
are that we need to take measures to keep inflation under 
control and also take necessary social measures. Having said 
this, there are positive aspects of which we can take advantage. 
This includes everything that concerns the improvement of 
national production in the rural areas and in small- and 
medium-sized companies. Our exports could also benefit. I 
think this devaluation is an opportunity for us to create 
conditions for a genuine control of our economy. 
  [Dupont] Your prime minister has called on the population to 
adopt patriotic behavior. For instance, he asked traders not to 
increase prices. This appeal has apparently not been heard. 
Certain prices have already been doubled in the Bamako markets. 
  [Konare] As you know, this is a reaction I would describe as 
almost normal after the announcement of the devaluation. We 
hope that things will get back to normal after the explanation 
we are going to give and the measures we are going to take. 
  [Dupont] Are you satisfied with the promised package of 
measures linked to the deal? 
  [Konare] I think the measures are certainly important, but 
they cannot be a substitute for the work and discipline that we 
should impose on ourselves. It is important that these measures 
should be implemented very quickly. We should create a package 
of important and lasting measures very quickly. This is the 
condition for avoiding social and political crises. I would 
even say that this is the only condition for preserving our 
relationship of cooperation with our partners. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow stated yesterday 
evening that Mali stood a really good chance of taking up the 
challenges brought about by the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
He then called on the people to adopt patriotic behavior in the 
face of the situation. 
  In a radio and television message, Prime Minister Sow states 
that the success of the current reform program depends on 
Malians' positive and highly patriotic behavior. The 
devaluation is undoubtedly a difficult and compulsory condition 
to fulfill, but our country stands a really good chance of 
taking up the challenges involved, he added.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] President Mahamane Ousmane returned to Niamey 
this afternoon from Dakar where he attended the summits on Air 
Afrique and the Monetary Union of West African States [UMOA]. 
The president speaks here on the outcome of these two meetings, 
beginning with Air Afrique: 
  [Begin Ousmane recording] The first phase of our 
deliberations centered on our multinational airline, Air 
Afrique, which, as you know, is in an extremely difficult 
situation. This is not very surprising because air transport 
has generally been facing serious difficulties over the past few 
years owing to a combination of several factors on the African 
continent and worldwide. [passage omitted] It was therefore 
necessary that this situation be reviewed and steps taken to 
ensure the airline's survival. This is what we did. What is 
worth noting is that steps were taken to recapitalize this 
company and draw up another rescue plan aimed at restoring its 
smooth operations. 
  As you know, the chairman and managing director of the 
airline was reelected and a number of specific recommendations 
were made aimed at avoiding a relapse into the past situation. 
I must stress that our French partners played a key role by 
making a fairly substantial contribution to this rescue plan. 
The various states were also requested to make significant 
contributions in proportion to their financial standing. A 
contribution of 100 million CFA is not much compared to 18 
billion CFA francs to be provided by the other side. However, 
in view of the hard times, it represents something all the same. 
On the whole, what we can say is that we got in step with the 
times, so to speak. [passage omitted] 
  The second meeting involved examining the situation of 
member 
countries of the franc zone. We all know the outcome -- the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, which now moves from the previous 
exchange rate of 1 French franc [Fr] to 50 CFA francs to a rate 
of Fr1 to 100 CFA francs. Taking into account the present 
predicament of a number of countries, including Niger, this 
actually seems to be quite a high devaluation. 
  If we examine the reevaluation rate of this currency in each 
country, we realize that the rates differ. As far as the Niger 
economy is concerned, this rate is relatively lower than that 
which has been adopted. But then, we are in a monetary zone. 
There is a certain degree of solidarity which must be 
maintained if we really want to enable the various countries to 
continue to enjoy the benefits that go with belonging to a 
single monetary zone and to forestall speculation. This is so 
because, since this currency is still overvalued, a devaluation 
at a relatively low rate would just encourage businessmen to 
speculate by saying to themselves: Well, this is a first 
devaluation and there must be others in the pipeline. 
  Obviously that would not get us anywhere, because the 
investments which stopped will not resume. The flight of 
capital will not end and people will continue to wait. With 
this rate, which is quite significant, people will say: That's 
right. The devaluation has been done once and for all. We can 
now go ahead. Everyone is clear in their mind and knows that 
surely there will be no further devaluation. There is that 
advantage. There is also the considerable advantage of ensuring 
that with this operation a certain number of problems faced by 
our countries can begin to get resolved, namely, the 
competitiveness of our various economies and the competitiveness 
of the various products manufactured in our countries either for 
domestic consumption or for export. Also, such an operation 
enables us to cope with a number of problems, particularly the 
fact that for some time now in the various franc zone countries 
investments have ground to a halt. We cannot continue this way. 
  The crisis has led our countries to attempt a number of 
adjustment programs and adopt internal measures. These measures 
have shown their limitations. We must envisage new measures 
which will enable the population to increase their production, 
settle down to work once more, and equally earn substantial 
income to be able to save and later invest. They should also 
offer foreign investors opportunities so that they bring in 
adequate capital to enable investments to restart. It is only 
through investments that we can secure economic growth and 
improve the living conditions of the people. 
  This is very important, because we must not look at this 
devaluation solely from a negative angle. We must not. As I 
said a short while ago, this is not the first time a devaluation 
is being carried out in our African countries. For the franc 
zone, it is perhaps the first time because that last setting of 
parity rate between the French franc and the CFA franc dates as 
far back as 1948. That was a long time ago. Nowhere in the 
world can one find a similar situation. 
  Our economies now are very competitive with each other, and 
the parity rates of the various currencies fluctuate 
permanently. It must be stated that the pegging of these rates 
and the time that this has lasted really constitute a record. 
What should be borne in mind here is that we must avoid 
panicking. Indeed, we must not panic. We must not embark on 
speculation cycles either. I have just learned that at our 
drugstores and some business houses, people have already begun 
to increase prices. Why should that be? That cannot be 
justified. There is absolutely no reason today, tomorrow, or 
the day after for a Niger businessman, or for that matter any 
businessman in the country, to increase prices. That cannot be 
justified. On what basis will it be? 
  Devaluation ultimately has a certain propensity to push up 
prices, but we need to wait for the various mechanisms to come 
into play before this inflationist trend begins. A number of 
measures were adopted precisely to contain this trend. We must 
avoid speculation and ensure that each of us plays the game 
honestly by avoiding pointless speculation and fraud, because 
the goods in stock or on the shelves at the moment are not in 
any way affected by this change of parity taking effect today. 
Things must be clearly understood and our various business 
organizations should see in this operation an opportunity 
opening to them -- an opportunity to make a fresh start, 
generally speaking. 
  This is what we can say about these summits. It was very 
tough; it was very difficult; but we must say, especially with 
regard to countries like Niger, that we came out positively. 
Among the backup measures, there were some which were very 
specific to our country. The agreements reached constitute a 
good thing and it is up to us to mobilize fully so that together 
we may tide over the crisis and set the national economy on the 
move once more. 
  After the deliberations on the change of CFA-French franc 
parity, we also conferred among ourselves as UMOA members. As 
you are aware, a number of initiatives have been undertaken for 
some time now. There was the experts' meeting and that of the 
various ministers of finance, economy, planning, and commerce on 
all matters relating to our UMOA. It was felt that we no longer 
treat economic and monetary concerns separately. Nowadays the 
two concerns are intimately linked. We decided to ensure that 
all these issues are examined in the same manner. This is why 
all the various meetings I mentioned earlier produced a draft 
treaty instituting the West African Economic and Monetary Union 
[UEMOA]. 
  This treaty marks the birth of a new union which, in a way, 
is an improvement over UMOA. It will have a high governing body 
which will be the heads of state and government, and a 
ministerial council. There will also be --and this is a novelty 
-- a commission composed of parliamentarians of the 16-member 
UEMOA, which will in a way serve as an executive organ of the 
union. This is also a decisive turning point in the process of 
integrating our economies as well as an action [words 
indistinct] with this decision to review the CFA-French franc 
exchange rate. In other words, the African integration process 
as a whole is on course and we hope that our businessmen will be 
dynamic enough to not only take part in the various actions 
enabling the recovery of our national economy, but also ensure 
our effective presence on the vast West African market which is 
unfolding. [end recording]

  [Text] The educational crisis has been at the center of a 
meeting between the minister of secondary and higher education 
and research and the various partners of the educational sector. 
Three hours of discussions failed to resolve the issue. In the 
face of the seriousness of the situation and the urgent need to 
find a solution as soon as possible, it was decided to form a 
select committee charged with meeting the prime minister, with a 
view to informing him of the demands of the Niger Schools' 
Union. These demands are preconditions for a return to a normal 
school situation. 
  It may be recalled that the Niger Schools' Union is 
demanding 
the reopening of the University of Niamey, the payment of 
scholarship arrears of 1.5 billion CFA francs, the payment of 
five months of allowances, and the payment of 96 million CFA 
francs in registration fees. The school partners are to meet 
the prime minister after the meeting.

  [Text] A former chief of general staff and (?renowned) 
frontline politician, Major General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, has 
called on the federal government to present its political agenda 
to put to rest the growing speculations and arguments on its 
tenure. Maj. Gen. Yar'Adua was addressing newsmen in Lagos 
today on the proposed constitutional conference [words 
indistinct] ensuring democratic and economic prosperity for the 
country. He noted the commitment of the administration to 
solving the economic and sociopolitical problems of the country, 
but he said it requires tolerance to restore the dignity of the 
military, [words indistinct] a permanent and (?enduring) 
structure based on the popular will of the people. 
  [Begin Yar'Adua recording] The administration should create 
the appropriate environment for a healthy and open debate by 
immediately lifting the ban on political activities and the 
press as well as freedom of association, which should allow free 
consultations and open debate on the issues that are fundamental 
to a harmonious coexistence of all Nigerians. Two, [as heard] 
the federal national conference should take off as soon as 
possible but not later than 1 March 1994. [end recording] 
  Gen. Yar'Adua suggested that representation to the 
conference 
should be by direct election of three members per senatorial 
district to ensure a fair representation of whatever ethnic and 
religious diversity that may exist and facilitate the resolution 
of matters by consensus. The conference, he also said, should 
not exceed three months, neither should [words indistinct] by 
appointment. He also suggested that renewed electoral 
activities, as determined by constitutional conference, should 
be begin between June and December while the administration 
ensures its tenure does not extend the beyond 31st of December 
this year.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gnassingbe Eyadema in </F>
Lome on 13 January -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Dear countrymen, our capital has just fallen victim 
once more to a terrorist attack masterminded from outside. This 
aggression, which was designed to take my life and the lives of 
the peace-loving citizenry and to seize power by force, failed 
despite its violent and cruel nature. It came at a time when 
our country had embarked on the second phase of putting our 
democratic institutions in place and when preparations toward 
the parliamentary elections are going ahead, involving all the 
political forces, in collaboration with French and German 
experts of the international monitoring committee and the 
National Electoral Commission, as well as with the effective 
commitment of our country. 
  This attempt to topple democracy cannot but arouse the 
strongest disapproval and indignation of the Togolese people, 
who have already suffered untold hardship and deprivation during 
this transitional period. The failure of this aggression 
demonstrates once more that no one can swim against the tide of 
destiny. 
  In 1977, at a time when nothing could constitute a rebellion 
against the Republic, mercenaries recruited from outside 
attempted to overthrow the government with the complicity of a 
handful of countrymen. This military coup failed because it was 
not aimed at preserving the interests of the people. In 1985, 
for the first time Lome was shaken by a series of explosions 
which claimed innocent lives and caused considerable damage. 
These criminal attacks were the early beginnings of a heavily 
armed terrorist commando operation launched from outside on 23 
September 1986 to invade our capital, invade the broadcasting 
house, eliminate me, and seize power. This attack, which 
unfortunately claimed more lives, failed once more with the help 
of God, who cannot bless an undertaking inspired by personal 
ambition, hatred, and vengeance. 
  Hardly 10 months ago, on 27 March 1993, with the complicity 
of a few officers, some armed groups who also came from outside 
managed to penetrate the Togolese Interarms Regiment camp and 
shot rockets point blank at my residence, aiming particularly at 
my sleeping quarters. They did not hit me, but they succeeded 
in murdering in cold blood two of my closest companions in arms. 
  This new attack, contrary to the interests of the people, 
has 
failed once again. The painful events that we have just 
witnessed on 5 to 6 January follow the same pattern. They did 
not give those responsible the expected results, despite the 
large deployment of men, arms, ammunition, and logistics. 
  Dear compatriots, the tragedy which has just befallen our 
country should be an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the 
destiny of our nation, which God has never wanted to abandon 
into the hands of those who only seek its destruction. This 
attack came just at the time when the Togolese people, who have 
suffered from three years of stormy transition, begin to 
entertain some hope again with the resumption of economic 
activities and payment of salaries. The aim of the terrorist 
action was to prevent free expression of the people at the 
legislative elections. Those who launched the attack have 
demonstrated, by so doing, their refusal to accept the 
democratic principles that they claim to defend. Just as they 
tried on the night preceding the presidential elections to 
embark on a terrorist action to prevent the elections from 
taking place, they are trying to disrupt the legislative 
campaign with violent actions. Togo leaves the international 
community to judge this behavior. 
  Our country is involved in an irreversible democratic 
process. We are leaving no stone unturned for the legislative 
elections to take place in total freedom and transparency. 
Nothing will deviate our course from this objective. 
  Today we must thank God for having saved us from this new 
trial and for having, once again, saved the Togolese people from 
chaos. 
  I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the security 
forces and services for the courage, determination, sense of 
duty, rapidity, and efficiency that they showed in returning the 
fire that resulted in the routing of the attackers. 
  I would also like to thank the residents of Lome and its 
vicinity for remaining cool, calm, and disciplined during this 
severe ordeal in accordance with government's instructions 
calling on them to stop and resume work for security reasons. 
  Furthermore, I especially want to commend and thank those 
who, in various manners, contributed to restoring social peace, 
which is indispensable for our development and welfare. 
  Finally, on your behalf, on that of the government, and in 
my 
own name, I would also like to present our most heartfelt 
condolences to the innocent victims' families and wish a prompt 
recovery to those who were wounded during this aggression. 
  Dear compatriots, a new year has begun. I hope that it will 
be for each of you a year of peace, health, fraternity, 
forgiveness, and love. May the democratic process continue to 
its end in dialogue, consultation, tolerance, and acceptance of 
each other. May our youth steer clear of those trying to divert 
them from the right path and earnestly continue their studies 
and professional training in order to give their best to our 
country. May those possessed by hatred and craving for revenge 
get rid of their resentment, abandon the path of violence, and 
utilize their intelligence and as their know-how to build our 
dear Togo a bit more each day instead of destroying it, as it 
remains the only treasure that we will bequeath to future 
generations. May this new year further bring us together each 
day to serve our country. 
  Long live Togo! Long live the Republic! Long live democracy!

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi met representatives 
of political parties, moral forces, and the civil society today. 
The purpose of the meeting was to relaunch discussions with the 
various partners so as to rebuild the social, political, and 
economic fabric which has been torn up following the 
assassinations perpetrated in Burundi. The participants 
discussed the main issues on which no compromise was reached 
during previous meetings, notably a formal framework for 
consultation, the drawing up of an open schedule, and the 
profile of the future president of the Republic. All the 
participants agreed on one important point. They decided on a 
political truce and called on the Burundi people to stop the 
demonstrations, destruction, harassment, and intimidation. 
  Apart from this meeting, Chairman Sylvestre Ntibantunganya 
of 
the Front for Democracy in Burundi, Chairman Joseph Nzeyimana of 
the Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development 
[RADDES], and the president of the Unity and National Progress 
Party [Uprona] made statements calling on their activists to act 
responsibly during these difficult times. 
  First, here is the statement by Sylvestre Ntibantunganya: 
  [Ntibantunganya] "I would like to tell Burundians who are 
listening to us either on radio or television that the current 
times in our country are difficult and that in order to surmount 
them, there is a need for positive contributions from everyone. 
We need peace, we need security. We need the establishment of 
trust between the various components of the Burundian nation, a 
nation which, if we are not careful, could go as far as breaking 
up. I therefore launch an urgent appeal to everyone to make a 
commitment to countering the danger. This country belongs to 
all of us in our diversities, ethnic, political, social or 
others. We therefore have to manage it, to live in it together 
without excluding anyone. We must manage it in security and 
ensure security for all. [passage omitted] 
  "Henceforth, destruction, killing, and harassment of others 
must no longer be accepted. Burundi has had enough. Burundians 
have had enough and instead wish for the rapid restoration of 
peace. We have responded to this call by deciding, at the level 
of political parties, on a truce, a truce implying that the 
demonstrations, the destruction, the harassment, the 
intimidation, and all sorts of misfortunes, must be stopped 
rapidly. 
  "We desire, at least at the level of our party, that the 
government will take all the adequate measures so that from 
tonight this can be achieved. We hope that all the partners 
understand that anyone who acts against the jointly expressed 
will will not be considered as being against such or such a 
political party or against such and such an ethnic group but 
against the Burundi people, who are vividly expressing their 
thirst for peace and security and their thirst to see trust 
reestablished among their components today. 
  "Therefore, men and women, the young and old who are 
listening to us, come behind us, help us to reestablish the 
peace which is yours, you Burundi people, the peace which is 
yours, you youth, women, housekeepers but also educators of the 
youth, the peace which, if we are not careful, we could lose 
control of. Lets keep all this world for peace and in peace. 
That is the meaning of the political truce that we have 
decided. Thank you." 
  The second statement is by Uprona parliamentary group 
chairman Jean-Baptiste Manwangari: 
  [Manwangari]" [passage omitted] There is a real will on the 
part of all political parties and associations present here and 
on the part of government to build on something solid in order 
to restore peace to our country. We all insisted that the 
common interest will henceforth guide all party and government 
activities. We believe that our people have gone through so much 
suffering that they should not be deprived again of the peace 
which they so badly need. We therefore call on all forces to 
come together in the movement searching for peace. We call on 
activists to promote peace, so that trouble ceases, both in 
Bujumbura and in the countryside. We believe that everyone will 
have a place in seeking solutions, and we are convinced that 
although discussions have not yet ended, if everyone continues 
on the same path, we will reach a consensus on solutions so that 
no one feels left out in the restoration of peace. [passage 
omitted]" 
  Last, let us listen to the statement by RADDES Chairman 
Joseph Nzeyimana: 
  [Nzeyimana] "I wish to tell those who are listening to me on 
radio and television that the political parties and the various 
associations met today to discuss important issues which could 
help restore peace to this country. [passage omitted] 
  "We call on citizens of this country--foreigners, those we 
have welcomed, those who came to invest, to keep the peace--to 
help us to succeed in the search for peace. We call on the 
youth and other forces to keep the peace and to await solutions 
and not to break windows, destroy people's huts, destroy houses, 
and especially not to kill. We ask you to wait for a while. 
Maybe you will get the solution you are seeking. Then we shall 
build a new Burundi with a new political framework, since we are 
moving towards a new social pact where nothing similar to what 
happened before can happen again; a pact that will ensure that 
no one kills his neighbor, that Hutus are not killed, that 
Tutsis are not killed, that Twas are not killed, that soldiers 
are not disturbed and that they do not kill others or get 
killed. Then, Burundi will be different, and we shall remake 
the image of this country in the eyes of foreign countries, 
since the outside world has started seeing us in a bad light. 
[passage omitted]"

  [Text] The government, ANC [African National Congress], and 
Freedom Alliance have held secret talks. Chief government 
negotiator Roelf Meyer says yesterday's talks were exploratory 
discussions to see whether there can be any basis for 
commonality. He says while no agreement had been reached, 
certain positions could now be taken back to the various 
parties's principals for approval. The government and ANC have 
been trying for months to reach a political settlement with the 
alliance which has rejected the interim constitution. The 
alliance is demanding a stronger federal system than provided in 
the constitution. The government and ANC have set 24 January as 
the deadline for the completion of negotiations on the 
constitution.

  [Text] Specific principles concerning the future national 
police force are now being discussed in Lusaka. Yesterday saw 
the approval of general principles. The relevant public 
announcement did not please UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye, but there was nothing to be done other than 
instruct the two sides to observe greater secrecy about the 
talks. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in Lusaka, reports on the 
peace talks today: 
  [Begin Ligio recording] (?This afternoon), the principles 
[words indistinct] were discussed [words indistinct] legal 
framework of the future national police force, its 
organizational structure, its [words indistinct] consensus 
[words indistinct] national constitution [words indistinct] 
plenary [words indistinct] exploratory contacts, by summoning 
the two sides, thereby forcing them to be on constant standby 
[preceding word in English]. It might be said that there are no 
fixed working rules. Beginning with the [words indistinct] the 
meetings were held separately. The mediators met the Angolan 
Government team during the morning and the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team in the afternoon. 
While that went on, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye 
would meet the side that was not involved in talks. 
  Observers close to the talks say that UNITA has already 
signed several documents, even though it continues publicly to 
deny having done so. Such documents reportedly include its 
waiver concerning the scrapping of the riot police, the 
regionalization of the police command, and UNITA's integration 
in the police corps. 
  Those observers have also said that at this stage the two 
sides are probably trying to bridge the gaps between the 
amendments that have been made so that a final document can be 
drawn up. A report came out yesterday saying that discussions 
had wound up concerning the general principles that will govern 
the future national police force, but that has not changed the 
mediators' position that secrecy must continue to surround the 
talks. The UN special representative has once again asked the 
two sides to abide by the infomation blackout [preceding word in 
English]. Such was the emphasis placed on this request by the 
mediators that this morning officials in the two negotiating 
teams were even quieter than usual and increased their distance 
from the media. Their behavior should ensure that, even more 
than before, the gods alone will know. [end recording]

  [Text] Bangui, 13 Jan (AFP) -- Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Mandaba of the Central African Republic announced here today the 
institution of price control measures in his country to "cushion 
the shock" of the 50-percent CFA franc devaluation. Speaking 
before the National Assembly, the prime minister also announced 
the setting up of a devaluation backup measures monitoring 
committee. 
  The government is studying backup measures needed to ensure 
the success of the devaluation and to safeguard the "fundamental 
interests of the business community and the people," he added. 
Mr. Mandaba believed that the "spin-off effects of the 
devaluation for his country's economy will be positive in the 
long run.... Public finance in particular is expected to be 
consolidated due to an expected increase in fiscal revenue." 
According to the prime minister, the expected increase in 
revenue will enable the state "to pay at least part of its 
internal arrears, especially to civil servants." 
  "We are expecting a recovery of our external finance, which 
we need, to beef up our investment recovery policy," he 
continued, judging -- without explaining -- that the country's 
gross domestic product "is expected to increase faster than 
forecast, by about 4 percent."

  [Text] Following his return on 12 January from the Dakar 
summit on the CFA franc devaluation and the conference of Air 
Afrique member states, President Ange-Felix Patasse received 
French charge d'affaires (Georges Roneaud) on the afternoon of 
13 January. The charge came to inform the head of state of the 
new French ambassador's arrival on the morning on 13 January. 
He took the opportunity to speak to the president about issues 
regarding auxiliary measures for the franc zone countries 
following the CFA franc devaluation. 
  Foreign Minister Simon Bedaya-Ngaro, presidential legal 
advisor (Jean-Jacques Delafousse), financial and economic 
advisor (Eric Dang Dimandi), and (Marcel Loubegue), secretary 
general to the presidency, were present at the meeting. Mr. 
Morel, head of the French cooperation mission, and Mr. Moudiard, 
director of the French Development Fund, represented France at 
the meeting. At the end of the meeting, the French charge 
d'affaires spoke to Jean Brassidi on the reason for his meeting 
with the head of state: 
  [Begin recording] [(Colraux)] Following the meeting of heads 
of state in Dakar and the devaluation of the CFA franc, France 
has put forward auxiliary measures based on two considerations: 
France is proposing the annulment of debts incurred as a result 
of cooperation as well as those which need to be paid up until 
the year 2020. That is the first point. The second point, 
which stems from the first, is our solidarity with African 
countries, since we remain part of the franc zone and we hope to 
continue cooperation and assist each of the African countries 
(?to cushion) the disastrous effects that have been felt by the 
population, which does not seem to be the case of [words 
indistinct] Central African Republic. A third point which is 
extremely important and which we hold dear is the creation of a 
special development fund with funds to the tune of $300 billion 
put in place by France for the 14 countries within the zone, but 
it is a fund which will manage funds contributed by financial 
backers. As of this evening, we will set to work to create here 
in Bangui, as well as in each capital of the franc zone, a 
special development fund to initiate development structures 
which will be [word indistinct] on the recommendation of suburbs 
or local authorities or nongovernmental organizations, and which 
(?will develop) not only the capital but also the provinces. 
  [Brassidi] These measures will be phased out. Does that 
mean they will take the form of short-, medium-, and long-term 
measures? 
  [(Colraux)] The measures concerning debt are immediate ones. 
Regarding the setting up of the special development fund, we 
will first have to arrange a meeting of donors, among whom 
France is a major contributor. This could be done within a few 
weeks; that is, a few weeks to sensitize the financial backers 
as well as those who are in need of aid, for instance, the local 
authorities, since this kind of project will not exceed 200 
billion CFA francs. If there are problems of water somewhere or 
problem in developing food crops in an area, or setting up a 
school [words indistinct] or the provision of blackboards or 
furniture to schools under the project -- all of which do not 
require long periods of feasibility study -- the (?measures) 
could be implemented with very short notice. [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 15 (AFP) -- The Congolese 
Government has introduced a price freeze, postponed a planned 
wage cut and lifted import taxes on staple foods in a bid to 
counter fallout from the recent 50 percent devaluation of the 
CFA franc. 
  The government decided late Friday at an emergency cabinet 
meeting devoted to the devaluation issue to postpone until 
further notice the proposed 20-to-35 percent reduction in 
salaries of state officials, spokesman Gabriel Matsiona told 
state radio. 
  The government also decided to suspend customs taxes on 
salted and fresh sea fish, poultry and vegetable oil, the 
spokesman added. 
  Matsiona also announced the creation of a "guarantee" fund 
to 
ensure importers of staple goods are able to buy fresh stocks, 
adding that rents and prices of petrol, bread, sugar, and other 
essentials were frozen until further notice. 
  The measures aim to counter inflation in the wake of 
Tuesday's [11 January] devaluation of the CFA franc, the main 
currency in francophone central and West Africa which has been 
pegged to the French franc.

  [Excerpts] Brazzaville, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Sporadic clashes 
between armed opposition forces and government soldiers 
continued in Brazzaville Saturday as the two sides failed to 
meet for talks aimed at ending three days of violence. 
  Witnesses reported isolated clashes early Saturday in the 
south of the capital between militiamen loyal to opposition 
leader Bernard Kolelas and troops of President Pascal Lissouba. 
  A commission under Defence Minister Raymond Damase Ngollo 
formed to mediate a solution to the crisis was in contact with 
both camps, officials said. But the officials added that the 
commission had failed to set up direct negotiations, although 
both sides said they were not in favour of a "military solution" 
to the standoff. 
  The negotiations are being flagged as a forum for opposition 
and pro-Lissouba forces to agree on the make-up of a government 
of national union to end a seven-month crisis sparked by 
disputed general elections last year. 
  The clashes have killed an estimated 110 people in 
Brazzaville since the beginning of December. [passage omitted 
covered in referent item] 
  Opposition forces say they favour the national unity 
government, provided the results of a judicial inquiry into 58 
calls for the annulment of voting in certains constituencies 
from the June 1 first round of polling onwards are published. 
The elections eventually returned a majority of 65 pro-Lissouba 
candidates, reversing the previous make-up of the 125-seat 
legislature. 
  Opposition forces believe the balance of power could shift 
again after the inquiry publishes its findings. They are 
scheduled to be released in February. 
  Clashes after the first round which claimed some 30 lives 
forced the suspension of polling. Voting resumed in October 
after both sides reached agreement in August to set up the 
inquiry. 
  But violence flared again in November, when around 50 died 
during fresh bloodshed in the capital. 
  The fighting has had a disastrous effect on Congo's already 
weakened economy, with opposition barricades forcing the closure 
of the rail link between Brazzaville and the port of 
Pointe-Noire, the country's main trading centre.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 16 (AFP) -- Sporadic shelling was 
heard overnight Saturday in the Bacongo and Makele-Kele 
districts in the south of the Congolese capital Brazzaville, 
marking renewed clashes between supporters and opponents of 
President Pascal Lissouba, witnesses said. 
  Bacongo, an opposition stronghold, has been the scene of 
repeated fighting since November, when Lissouba ordered a 
crackdown on "brigands" among the opposition. 
  Lissouba's opponents were excluded from parliamentary bodies 
created last June, and fresh elections in October failed to 
resolve the situation. 
  Government troops in armoured vehicles used heavy weaponry 
against opposition supporters in the same districts on Thursday 
and Friday when they came under machine gun fire, witnesses said. 
  The shelling had died down Sunday morning, but there were 
still bursts of fire from machine pistols in the Makele-Kele 
district.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 16 (AFP) -- Four people were killed 
in clashes between government forces, pro-government and 
opposition militias in the capital of Congo from Friday to 
Sunday, a hospital official said. Another man was killed by 
unknown gunmen in the central Ouenze district of Brazzaville, 
the official added. 
  The four dead were killed in separate clashes between 
government forces and opposition militia on the one hand and 
pro-government and opposition militia on the other. 
  This brought the death toll since the resumption of fighting 
in the capital in mid-December to 115. 
  After several days of relative calm, clashes resumed on 
Thursday [13 January] and Friday, with government forces using 
heavy weapons to respond to machine gun fire from opposition 
militias. More heavy weapons fire was heard late Saturday 
evening in Makele- Kele district, where government troops had 
deployed in armoured vehicles to try to separate the clashing 
rival militias, a military source said. 
  The shelling had died down Sunday morning, but there were 
still bursts of fire from machine pistols in the district. 
  In the other areas of the capital, government forces 
continued to check vehicles for arms. 
  Meanwhile a presidential statement said an officer guarding 
President Pascal Lissouba was kidnapped on Saturday by "the 
private militia" of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas but it 
gave no details of the abduction. The statement called for 
national mediator, Defence Minister Raymond Damase N'gollo, to 
do everything possible to gain the release of Lieutenant 
Jonathon Mabiala.

  [Text] Lieutenant Jonathan Mabiela, an officer of the 
Congolese presidential security, was kidnapped and executed by 
opposition militiamen. He was a victim of the rising tension in 
Brazzaville. Gilbert David Moutakela has the details: 
  [Begin recording] The situation deteriorated suddenly this 
afternoon in Brazzaville after the kidnapping of a presidential 
security officer. Lt. Jonathan Mabiela was kidnapped and 
executed by private opposition militiamen. Elements of the 
presidential guard, feeling that their pride was hurt, decided 
to avenge their colleague. Before they could attack, the 
directorate of the presidential security sent an ultimatum to 
the prime minister, mediators of the republic, and Bernard 
Kolelas. In a message announced on national radio, the 
presidential security directorate demanded the liberation of Lt. 
Mabiela. The ultimatum from the presidential security expired 
this evening at 1800, but the body of the dead lieutenant is 
nowhere to be found. All elements of the presidential security 
on leave were called urgently back to their units, and tough 
measures are expected. 
  It must be noted that the places where the action will be 
focused essentially are in the southern part of Brazzaville -- 
Bacongo and Makele-Kele, where violence has continued despite 
many calls for calm by political leaders and the Congolese Armed 
Forces. 
  It must be recalled that since the beginning of the 
Congolese 
crisis in July 1993, several officers of the Congolese Armed 
Forces, including a major and a colonel, have been kidnapped. 
Those who were not killed were released after being subjected 
to untold hardships. [end recording] 
  [Brazzaville Radio Nationale Congolaise Network in French at 
1830 on 16 January opens its regular newscast with the following 
communique issued and read and signed by the director of the 
presidential security service: "Elements of the presidential 
security have read an ultimatum in which they demanded the body 
of their colleague from Bernard Kolelas and his group. As 
director of presidential security, I declare that these soldiers 
have no business losing their calm, because the president of the 
Republic held talks this morning with the national mediators, 
who are the only people authorized to settle any disputes and 
conflicts between individuals and groups of individuals in the 
country. I would like to reassure the people of Brazzaville 
that suitable organs to ensure peace and national harmony have 
begun work since this morning on the orders of both the 
president of the Republic and the prime minister. I would 
therefore like to stress that the ultimatum read earlier is null 
and void because no authority conceived nor approved it 
previously."]

<F P=106> [Address by President Mobutu Sese Seko in Kinshasa on 14 </F>
January -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Very dear compatriots, I am addressing you for the 
second time in 10 days because in my 4 January message to the 
nation I called on the political circles, especially the 
negotiators, to go back to the dialogue table to sign the 
agreements sanctioning their consultations that were taking 
place in the Palais du Peuple. 
  Fortunately, the signing of the draft agreement and of the 
particular arrangements related to the equitable and balanced 
sharing of power during the transitional period is today a 
reality. I therefore called on [break in reception] the 
abolition of the double institution system and the creation of a 
single parliament called the High Council of the Republic [HCR] 
or transitional parliament, and the formation of a single 
government, fourth, the adoption of a referendum and electoral 
timetable. I am convinced that the proper implementation of 
these provisions will definitively put an end to the political 
confusion that has prevailed so far in the country. 
  The immediate consequences of the coming into force of these 
Palais du Peuple agreements are the dissolution of the National 
Assembly that resulted from the 1987 legislative elections and 
of the High Council of the Republic that resulted from the 
sovereign national conference, and the resignation of the 
present transitional government which, as of today, is charged 
with taking care of current affairs until the formation of a new 
government. 
  Very dear compatriots, as promised in my recent New Year's 
message, I will very soon sign the texts sanctioning the Palais 
du Peuple agreements. Right now, as far as I am concerned, I 
will summon the HCR, that is the transitional parliament, to an 
extraordinary session on 17 January. The agenda for this 
session, which will not extend past 15 days, might include the 
following points: First, the internal organization of the 
parliament, which implies the verification and validation of the 
terms of office of its members, the working out and adoption of 
its rules of procedure, the election of its standing executive 
committee, and the setting up of its working commissions; 
second, the drawing up and adoption of the constitutional text 
of the transition; and third, the election of the prime 
minister, head of the transitional government. 
  Dear countrymen, regarding the transitional government, I 
would like to recall that in conformity with the spirit of the 
agreements signed at the Palais du Peuple and my renewed promise 
on 4 January, the prime minister and head of the government is 
expected to be appointed from the opposition. His appointment 
must be decided by consensus at a consultative meeting between 
the political and social forces represented within the High 
Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament. 
  As everyone knows, during the four months of consultations 
at 
the Palais du Peuple, no consensus was reached on the nomination 
of the prime minister of the transitional government. On 9 
January, that is five days after my 4 January message to the 
nation, the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] allies 
and the political forces of the conclave reached a consensus on 
a prime ministerial candidate in the person of Professor Mulumba 
Lukoyi. Furthermore, in a letter addressed to me on 12 January, 
the USOR introduced the candidature of Mr. Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba. 
  In accordance with the democratic logic underlying the 
accords of the Palais du Peuple and in virtue of the 
attributions of the High Council of the Republic, the 
transitional parliament, it is up to this institution to 
deliberate the issue. I will therefore wait for the High 
Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament, to 
proposes to me an ordinance to be issued on the name of the new 
prime minister and head of government. 
  Nevertheless, on account of the acute crisis facing the 
country, along with the people, I expect that this time the 
transitional parliament will not be bogged down in futile and 
ill-timed quarrels. 
  My dear countrymen, to end this message, I urge all Zairian 
citizens -- men, women, and children -- each in his sector, to 
show a high sense of discipline, patriotism, and civic duty so 
that in 1994, with the help of God and our ancestors, we can 
conclude our democratic process. Thus we can allow Zaire to at 
last play the role that belongs to it in the concert of nations 
of Africa and the world. 
  God bless Zaire and its people. Thank you.

  [Text] Kinshasa, Jan 14 (AFP) -- President Mobutu Sese Seko 
on Friday dissolved Zaire's government and opposition-led 
transitional legislature on the strength of an agreement between 
his own camp and the opposition to end a stalemate that had 
produced two prime ministers and two parliaments. Mobutu 
dissolved the mainstream National Assembly as well and announced 
the formation of a new transitional High Council of the Republic 
cum National Assembly. He said it would hold its first session 
on January 17 and would select a premier from two candidates 
presented by Mobutu loyalists and the opposition led by Prime 
Minister Etienne Tshisekedi. 
  The president, in power since 1965, said he hoped the new 
High Council "would not get bogged down in the byzantine 
quarrels" that have left Zaire with two rival governments, 
parliaments and prime ministers. 
  Joseph Ileo, the vice president of the now-dissolved HCR, 
immediately attacked the move, calling it a "constitutional coup 
d'etat" by the Zairean president. 
  The Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) gathered around 
Mobutu and the Holy Alliance of Radical Opposition (USOR), which 
backs the presidents's arch-rival Tshisekedi, had earlier in the 
day reached agreement on reshaping the interim legislature, a 
spokesman for the Holy Alliance, Gerard Kamanda, said. "The 
president does not have the powers to dissolve the High Council 
even if an agreement has been signed," Ileo told AFP, adding 
that the documents should have been submitted to the council for 
approval. 
  The aim of the latest round of negotiations -- which had 
been 
going on for more than 10 days -- had been to draw up an 
agreement on Zaire's transition to genuine parliamentary 
democracy and to form a new government, ending the co-existence 
of rival teams. 
  Tshisekedi, whom the president was compelled to appoint as 
prime minister last year but tried to sack in February as part 
of a power struggle, had refused to step down. Tshisekedi 
claimed to have the support of the national conference on 
democracy which set up the original HCR and whose sovereignty 
Mobutu always refused to recognise. Mobutu subsequently 
appointed another prime minister, Faustin Birindwa. 
  Violent clashes in October 1991 led to increasing pressure 
at 
home and from major aid donors for Mobutu to reform his 
autocratic system of government. 
  Tshisekedi was relected as de facto head of government in 
August 1992 by the democracy conference.

  [Text] Comments have been running high at political 
parties' headquarters and among the general public after 
President Mobutu Sese Seko's address to the nation yesterday. 
Apart from the issues he discussed, the president announced the 
resignation of the present government headed by Faustin Birindwa 
and mentioned the names of Professor Mulumba Lukoyi and Etienne 
Tshisekedi as candidates for the post of prime minister as 
proposed by their respective political groups. 
  However, the list is not limited, stated Kipolongo 
Mukambilwa 
yesterday evening. In fact, a third candidate, (Kabangu Musa), 
has just been announced by his party, the National Union for 
Progress [Union Nationale pour le Progres], Unapro. It claims 
to be a party from the new political class supporting neither of 
the two main rival political groups -- presidential camp or the 
Sacred Union of the opposition. Unapro nominated its candidate 
at the end of its extraordinary session held today to examine 
all the consequences of the address by President Mobutu 
yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Jose Konga Bakombo, 
national chairman of the party.

  [Text] There is a new political deal in Zaire: The head of 
the Zairean state, President Mobutu, announced yesterday the 
resignation of the government of Faustin Birindwa, who will be 
responsible for current matters until the appointment of a new 
prime minister. The latter will have to be appointed within the 
next two weeks by the High Council of the Republic, which will 
also include President Mobutu's political allies. 
  Two candidates will stand, Etienne Tshisekedi and Mulumba 
Lukoji. Lukoji has already held this post; he inaugurated the 
national conference two years ago. He is the candidate of the 
parties close to the Presidency, whereas Etienne Tshisekedi 
remains the candidate of the opposition. On the opposition's 
side, the president's speech has provoked anger and outrage. 
For the Christian Democrat PDCS [Democratic and Social 
Christian Party], this is merely a constitutional coup. There 
has been another reaction, that of the UDPS [Union for Democracy 
and Social Progress], Etienne Tshisekedi's party, which is the 
hard core of the Radical Sacred Union of the opposition. Herve 
de Guelinck spoke to Justine Kasavubu: 
  [Begin recording] [Kasavubu] It is an extra obstacle. You 
may remember that Mobutu said a few days ago that he agreed to a 
prime minister from the opposition. That has now been shown to 
be a lie. He has given Mulumba Lokoji a leg-up, which means 
that after Mulumba Lokoji, we will still have Mungul Diaka 
[presidium chairman of Alliance of Independent Forces for 
Integral Change] and Nguza Karl-I-Bond. This is the Mobutist 
carousel. 
  [Guelinck] Yet it will be up to the transitional parliament 
to appoint the candidate, won't it? 
  [Kasavubu] But the transitional parliament never said that 
Mr. Tshisekedi was out of bounds, so I think that the 
counsellors of the Republic will be keen to set Mr. Tshisekedi 
back to work [as heard] and to tell Mobutu once and for all that 
the comedy is over.

  [Text] The situation in Kinshasa in Zaire is tense. Troops 
are preventing the High Council of the Republic [HCR] from 
meeting. The HCR was to have started expanding itself, thereby 
turning itself into the transitional parliament. This goes 
against the views of President Mobutu, who announced on Friday 
evening that he was dissolving his government and fusing 
together the HCR and the National Assembly. 
  Etienne Tshisekedi has come out against what he is calling a 
takeover by force. Etienne Tshisekedi is one of the main 
opponents of President Mobutu, and he is still prime minister of 
one of the two governments disputing the running of Zaire. 
These decisions are anti-constitutional, he says, and go 
against all the agreements that have been made. He has called 
on the international community not to allow itself to be misled.

  [Text] The guest of Afrique Soir is Etienne Tshisekedi, the 
Zairean opposition leader who is also the prime minister 
appointed by the national conference. As you know, Marshal 
Mobutu announced the dissolution of his own government, that of 
Faustin Birindwa, and summoned the members of the former 
National Assembly and of the High Council of the Republic on 
Wednesday [19 January], so that they can elect a new prime 
minister. The opposition has already announced that it regards 
this decision as a coup. Tshisekedi broke his silence today. 
He spoke to Monique Mas: 
  [Begin recording] [Tshisekedi] The real reason behind the 
deadlock is that I was elected prime minister by the sovereign 
National Conference, whereas Mr. Mobutu does not know [as heard] 
this conference; he is going back to his own Constitution, and 
this is dictatorship. This is why cohabitation is impossible, 
because we do not have the same source of power. This is why 
there were negotiations, so that we could define a common 
framework of power. Cohabitation is necessary because the law 
makes provisions for it. But since this law does not exist as 
far as Mr. Mobutu is concerned, this is why we cannot cohabit. 
  [Mas] During this long-lasting crisis, don't you have the 
feeling that the Zairean people may get tired of everyone, 
including the opposition and yourself? 
  [Tshisekedi] Just the opposite. If you were here, you would 
know that the people are more determined. It is [political] 
circles -- certain political circles, especially those who 
supported Mr. Mobutu's dictatorship not too long ago -- who are 
saying such things, that people may get tired. People cannot 
get tired in their struggle for liberation. People are dealing 
with a dictator who enslaved them for years. They cannot get 
tired of struggling to break free from slavery. We have not 
chosen the [word indistinct] of arms, but we have chosen 
nonviolence, and this is also the price that has to be paid. 
  [Mas] Very recently, the French Minister of Cooperation Mr. 
Roussin was saying that a third way between you, Mr. Tshisekedi, 
and the government of the parties close to the president, would 
be a solution for Zaire. What do you think of that? 
  [Tshisekedi] Yes, but we have got used to the position of 
the 
French Government lately. So, we attribute to the French 
Government putting pressure on the Togolese prime minister to 
put him on the side of the dictator, because for them, they 
think that when you have a dictator, you should be loyal to him 
rather than put yourself on the side of the people. The Zairean 
people, (?and) we who are following all this maneuvering by the 
French Government, you can count on us: Mr. Roussin can speak, 
he has the right to speak like anyone else, but in this country 
we will ignore both Mr. Roussin and everything he says. 
  [Mas] How do you imagine the immediate future of Zaire? How 
do you expect to act in the immediate future? 
  [Tshisekedi] Next Wednesday, 19 January, is the day Mr. 
Mobutu intends to establish his new puppet government. We have 
just called on all our people, both in Kinshasa and up country, 
to hold a ghost town day that day, to show him our opposition 
and our discontent, and we will also use a huge number of other 
strategies -- mass demonstrations, civil disobedience, and so on 
-- so that Mr. Mobutu will get involved, and we know that he 
will do so. [end recording]

  [Text] Kinshasa, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Zairian opposition leader 
Etienne Tshisekedi has called for a strike to turn Kinshasa into 
a "ghost town" on Wednesday [19 January] to protest President 
Mobutu Sese Seko's dissolution last week of the government and 
the opposition-led transitional legislature. 
  Tshisekedi told a news conference Mobutu, who also dissolved 
the National Assembly, had carried out a "constitutional coup 
d'etat". 
  On Friday Mobutu said an accord signed by his own supporters 
and the radical opposition meant that the government of Faustin 
Birindwa set up nine months ago should be dissolved "with 
immediate effect" along with the transitional High Council of 
the Republic (HCR) and the rival National Assembly. 
  A long-running power struggle between Mobutu and the 
opposition had left the country with two governments, including 
one led by Tshisekedi, and two parliaments. 
  Tshisekedi, at a press conference on Sunday, condemned the 
dissolution of the HCR and claimed there had been "abuse" in 
interpreting the agreement signed by the opposition Holy 
Alliance, which was concerned mainly with reforming the HCR and 
drawing up an election timetable. 
  Presidential supporters and the opposition had been engaged 
in talks since last September to resolve the political crisis. 
Mobutu ordered the HCR and the National Assembly to unite to 
form a new transitional assembly and to choose a new prime 
minister. 
  The first session of the enlarged body, originally set for 
Monday, has been put back to Wednesday.

  [Text] Following the head of state's message of 14 January, 
several political parties have been analyzing it. The Chistian 
Democrats Party's [PDC] interim chairman, Boboliko, chaired a 
meeting over the weekend. After the meeting Vice Chairman 
(Mbesi Mbenatubi) spoke to reporters. He told reporters that no 
son of Zaire can any longer take it upon himself alone to decide 
for the country. According to Mr. Mbenatubi, one cannot stand 
on the signing of a draft protocol agreement to dissolve the 
High Council of the Republic, which emanated from the sovereign 
national conference.

<F P=106> [News conference given by Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo, </F>
chairman of the High Council of the Republic, at the 
Inter-Diocesan Center in Kinshasa on 17 January; recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, the week of 9-16 January will 
remain a historic week for our country Zaire. In fact, during 
that week, all the necessary conditions for a happy ending of 
the political consultations at the Palais du Peuple were 
practically met. Actually, as far as we know, all the various 
components of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] 
and the Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC], have either 
signed or have made up their mind to sign the protocol accord 
issued at the end of that political consultation. We take note 
of this fact and also note with joy the desire clearly expressed 
by the entire political class to see a successful end to the 
negotiations of the Palais du Peuple and implement them in 
accordance with laid down procedures and in conformity with the 
accord concluded. 
  We congratulate all the parties engaged in the negotiations 
for the results obtained. We urgently ask them not to 
compromise the results of such a delicate and tedious work. 
That is why we deplore the fact that the calm atmosphere of 
dialogue and tolerance that prevailed throughout the political 
negotiations is now giving place to upset and a partisan spirit 
of intolerance and mistrust. It would be criminal to turn into 
failure all the 10 months of efforts deployed to find a solution 
to this political crisis which has been the bane of our people. 
We therefore call on all the political parties and their 
leaders to refrain from any declarations, attitudes, and acts 
likely to inflame passions, poison the situation, and drive away 
forever a solution which is already so close. We invite all 
political leaders to work toward a harmonious end as well as the 
implementation of the accords of the Palais du Peuple.

<F P=106> [Excerpt of a news conference by Communications Minister </F>
Ngongo Luwowo with unidentified local reporters at the National 
Television House in Kinshasa on 17 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Unidentified reporter] It is not to show off 
that we have come to see you, but we have come to see you so you 
may answer some questions that have been on the minds of the 
people. These questions center around the recent speech of the 
president of the Republic. We have come to you for 
clarification, especially in your capacity as participant in the 
political consultations. We would like to have more of such 
meetings for the better understanding of the developments in the 
country. My first question, Mr. Minister, is that the public 
has been wondering whether President Mobutu Sese Seko actually 
dissolved the High Council of the Republic [HCR] and the 
parliament? What do you say to that? 
  [Luwowo] You know, things are very clear but it is only 
those 
who do not want to see democracy advance and to see an end to 
the transition period that are complicating matters. In his 
address to the nation the head of state did not dissolve the 
High Council of the Republic or the parliament. The head of 
state simply took note of the decision made by the two major 
political families of Zaire which were engaged in negotiations 
at the Palais du Peuple. These two political groups, at the end 
of their negotiations, decided on a certain number of things 
among which is the creation of an HCR- Transitional Parliament. 
That is to say, a single parliament which will comprise the 
present National Assembly, the HCR, and participants in the 
political negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  The head of state, who is the guarantor of the nation, did 
not refer to any constitutional provisions contested by any one 
of the groups. He referred exactly to what was agreed upon in 
the protocol agreement and said the HCR as it is now composed 
ceases to exist, the National Assembly as it is presently 
composed also ceases to exist, and of course, participants in 
the negotiations, having arrived at the end of their 
negotiations, cease to exist as an entity. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed D.Gr.: "New Departure for the Zairian </F>
Transition?] 
  [Text] As expected, President Mobutu addressed the nation 
on Friday evening. Although he stopped short of unilaterally 
naming a prime minister, he nevertheless announced measures 
which depart from the constitutional framework as agreed by the 
Sovereign National Conference (CNS) which, we should remember, 
brought together all elements of Zairian political life and 
civil society. 
  Contrary to the Zairian leader's claims, not all parties 
have 
signed the protocol of agreement between the opposition and 
presidential party. At the very most, the Sacred Union of the 
Radical Opposition indicated last Wednesday that it would agree 
to sign it and some representatives have put their signatures to 
the text. Moreover, Mobutu would have no right to dissolve the 
High Council of the Republic (HCR), which resulted from the 
national conference, and to merge it with "his" national 
assembly. The opposition sees this as a further "constitutional 
coup d'etat" by the president. Clever as always, Mobutu would 
thus be undoing the work of the CNS while forgetting that the 
validity of his own position stems from it. His mandate in fact 
expired in December 1991 and was extended by the conference 
members at the insistence of the Western partners (the Americans 
in particular) in order to avoid a transition marked by 
conflict. As is customary, Mobutu is dipping into the texts to 
retrieve that which suits his own ends. 
<H5>  Lukoji Against Tshisekedi? </H5>
  In his Friday evening address, Mobutu announced that the 
remodelled interim HCR-Parliament was to meet yesterday and 
should, over the next two weeks, deal with matters of its 
internal organization (validation of mandates, rules of 
procedure, election of officers, setting up of committees), 
drawing up and adopting the interim constitutional act, and the 
choice of a prime minister drawn from the opposition, whose 
appointment should be sanctioned by a presidential decree. He 
also indicated that the allies of the Sacred Union of the 
Radical Opposition and the presidential party had suggested 
Mulumba Lukoji as prime minister, while the Sacred Union 
continued to support Etienne Tshisekedi. 
  For their part, the opposition representatives do not want 
to 
hear any talk of the immediate dissolution of the HCR. They 
believe it should first examine the texts of the protocol of 
agreement. If it concludes that they do not violate the statute 
of the CNS, it must have them signed by all the parties 
(including Mobutu) at a formal ceremony in the presence of 
foreign witnesses. 
  Finally, the meeting scheduled for this Monday has been 
postponed until Wednesday. It seems that this is designed to 
provide time for tempers to cool off. On Sunday the present HCR 
was unable to sit. The military prevented it from doing so under 
the pretext that the president had terminated its legal 
existence. For his part, Etienne Tshisekedi has rejected the 
presidential decisions and pointed out that he is the only 
"legal" prime minister because he was elected by the CNS. He 
also called upon the population to respect a total shutdown of 
activities on Wednesday. 
<H5>  Monsengwo to the Rescue </H5>
  Whereas Mobutu has succeeded in reviving tensions, the HCR 
president has been seeking to ease them. In any event, 
Monseigneur Monsengwo seems ready to confront the radical 
opposition. In his opinion, all political factions have "either 
signed or reached a decision to sign the protocol of agreement." 
The prelate considers them to be historic agreements. He has 
thus called upon the parties not to compromise "the result of so 
much hard work." 
  Monseigneur Monsengwo wants the HCR to meet "right away" in 
order "to be able to take up the option which allows it to form 
a single body with the former national assembly." He has thus 
admitted in substance that this institution should give way to 
the interim HCR- Parliament, now remodelled following political 
agreements. 
  This declaration will certainly not please the most radical 
opposition members who believe the new HCR will be dominated by 
the presidential party and members of the moderate opposition 
with little inclination to support Tshisekedi. 
<H5>  Paris as the Third Way </H5>
  All this should make it possible to arrive at the "third 
way" 
as suggested by the French cooperation minister. According to 
Michel Roussin, a "third way must be found between Etienne 
Tshisekedi and the government appointed by Mobutu." For the 
opposition, this amounts to nothing less than abandoning 
Tshisekedi and breaking the consensus binding Belgium, the 
United States and France. 
  It should be noted that neither Belgium nor the United 
States 
have reacted to Mobutu's statements. Both countries seem to be 
waiting to see how things develop and if the latest negotiations 
manage to ease the tension. 
  But the fact remains that the Belgian Government does not 
seem very worried by the prospect of the HCR disappearing so 
easily, despite the fact that it has always seen it as the sole 
representative body of the Zairian transition. 
  The alarming descriptions of what is happening in the field 
also seem to be meeting with little reaction. 
  Several witnesses report troop movements, sporadic looting 
and violence, none of which augurs well. 
  Many people are now hoping above all that Mobutu becomes 
genuinely involved in the interim process in order to avoid any 
further breaking of the consensus and further delays for the 
transition.

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today at 
State House, Nairobi, held talks with the visiting vice premier, 
Mr. Qian Qichen, who is also the minister for foreign affairs. 
Welcoming him, President Moi noted that the friendship between 
the two countries goes back to 1963 when Kenya became 
independent. He thanked the Chinese Government for undertaking 
important development projects in Kenya, citing the Kasarani 
sports complex as a monument of the cooperation between the two 
countries. Noting that China played an important role in the 
economic life of Kenyans, President Moi urged Chinese 
entrepreneurs to invest more in Kenya. 
  On recent economic and political reforms, President Moi said 
Kenya had undergone a very difficult time as the changes were 
not only new but incomprehensible to the people. He said he 
admired the Chinese policies because they were determined by and 
formulated to respond to the wishes of the people and obtaining 
local situations. His Excellency the president said although 
Kenyan communities were not yet cohesive, the government was 
working hard to unite the people. He said it was good to have a 
friend like China who understood Kenya's viewpoint in the light 
of the prevailing political and economic situation. 
  On the recent East Africa cooperation treaty President Moi 
noted that the region had over 70 million people which he said 
was a vast market for investors. He pointed out that market 
opportunities are made even more bright considering the 
preferential trade area. President Moi briefed the Chinese vice 
premier on the efforts to resolve conflicts in the region and 
especially in the Sudan whose peace initiative committee he 
chairs. 
  Mr. Qichen congratulated President Moi for the 1992 
successful general elections and also for his victory in the 
presidential race. The vice premier said China admired President 
Moi's role in promoting peace and stability in the region. He 
also said the good relations existing between the two countries 
formed a good basis for stronger political and economic 
cooperation. Mr. Qichen said for the last 15 years China had 
undergone a tremendous economic transformation after opening up 
to the outside world. 
  Later, President Moi received the spiritual leader of Coptic 
Orthodox Church, Pope Shenouda III. Pope Shenouda, who last 
visited Kenya 15 years ago, said he had been impressed by the 
country's development, especially through the spirit of 
harambee. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 17 Jan (KNA) -- The vice president and 
minister for planning and national development Professor George 
Saitoti today hailed the cordial relations existing between 
Kenya and China. The vice president told the visiting Chinese 
minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, that Kenya and China had maintained 
very cordial relationships in the last 30 years of Kenya's 
independence. 
  Mr. Qian Qichen, who is also the minister for foreign 
affairs 
of the People's Republic of China, had made a courtesy call on 
the vice president in his office at the Treasury. The vice 
president stated that although China was a developing nation, 
the country had been able to assist Kenya and the gesture 
underscored that China was a true friend of Kenya. [passage 
omitted] 
  Prof. Saitoti said the government had introduced fundamental 
economic reforms, making the economy more market oriented. He 
called on Chinese companies to avail themselves of the 
attractive economic packages and invest in the country. 
  Mr. Qian Qichen told the vice president that China was 
satisfied with the cordial relationships and mutual cooperation 
between China and Kenya. He said China considered Kenya as an 
important nation in the eastern African region and hailed the 
vital role it was playing in the economic integration and peace 
initiatives in the region. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, 18 Jan (KNA) -- The visiting Chinese vice- 
premier and minister for foreign affairs Mr Qian Qichen said 
yesterday that the major problem facing African countries in 
revamping its stalled economies was due to the new political 
changes which were based on tribal lines. [sentence as 
received] He said the introduction of multiparty politics in 
Africa had led African states to turmoil and civil strife 
because the parties were based on tribal lines, forcing the 
government to be unable to play their due role in stabilizing 
their economies. 
  Addressing local and international journalists at a Nairobi 
hotel, Mr Qian Qichen said it was impossible for African 
countries to concentrate on economic problems facing them under 
the new political and economic situations set by [the] IMF and 
World Bank which have plunged many African countries into 
turmoil and civil wars. 
  The premier, who is on a tour to Kenya, Madagascar, 
Mauritius, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea to promote relations and 
acquaint himself with the situation the region, said Africa had 
not been marginalized by the international community and that 
its future was bright. 
  Earlier, the premier signed an agreement with his Kenyan 
counterpart Mr Kalonzo Musyoka in which the Chinese Government 
would grant to the Kenya Government one batch of general 
commodities worth 10 million Kenyan shillings. Mr Musyoka said 
the commodities, which are of assorted wares, would be auctioned 
and its proceeds placed at the public accounts kitty. He 
thanked the Chinese Government for its support in various 
development projects, and challenged them to invest in Kenya, as 
the market is open for competition following the liberalization 
of economy and the opening up [of] trade links in east and 
central Africa.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mogadishu, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Clansmen of Somali 
warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and those of his main rival, 
self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, took a break 
from peace talks Saturday but were to resume negotiations Sunday. 
  About 175 representatives of General Aidid's Habr Gedir clan 
and the Abgal of Ali Mahdi are taking part in the talks. They 
have been convened and chaired by a respected Islamic leader, 
the Imam of Hirab. But the talks are being funded by the United 
Nations. 
  The world body has opted for a lower-profile, "catalytic" 
role in brokering the restoration of civilian authority in the 
increasingly lawless Somali capital since talks among the main 
warlords collapsed without agreement in Addis Ababa last month, 
senior UN officials said. 
  "We welcome the talks. They are being held among clan elders 
and we will not interfere," said a senior official of Aidid's 
Somali National Alliance (SNA), Issa Mohamed Siad. "They are 
non- political," said Issa, who denied reports that a senior SNA 
official, Abdi Qaydid, was attending. 
  Independent Somali observers said no talks could achieve a 
lasting settlement without the participation of the warlords 
themselves. UN officials, however, expressed optimism about the 
inter-clan talks in Mogadishu. "Pressure is building from the 
rank- and-file to stop fighting," said one official. "The foot 
soldiers are tired." [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile Mogadishu residents complained of a mounting wave 
of banditry that spares no one, not even Aidid's inner circle. 
The brother of SNA secretary-general Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali was 
shot dead by bandits who stole his car on Thursday, SNA 
officials said. 
  The sandy, potholed roads leading out of Mogadishu, choked 
with donkey carts and overloaded, antiquated trucks, are again 
infested with armed bandits to an extent not seen since before 
the multinational military intervention began 13 months ago, UN 
officials and Somali residents said. 
  "We've reduced our presence on the streets and people are 
paying the price in terms of banditry, but it's time for Somalis 
to understand that the international community only has limited 
patience and limited resources for Somalia," one senior UN 
official said. 
  On Thursday about two dozen Somalis with gunshot, shrapnel 
and knive wounds streamed into UN hospitals in Mogadishu, but 
the cause of the violence in which they were hurt remained 
mysterious. 
  Food prices have risen ahead of the Moslem fast Ramadan, and 
the value of the Somali shilling has fallen 10 percent against 
the dollar, making foreign products more expensive. 
  "As the Western forces pull out, merchants have stopped 
bringing in commodities," said a Somali businessman, Mohamed 
Sheikh, who imports domestic goods from Kenya on dhows, the 
traditional Arab boats that ply the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. 
"Everyone fears insecurity," said Mohamed, 50. 
  Aidid remained in Nairobi on Saturday, where he has met 
other 
factional leaders and US envoy Richard Bogosian, a US official 
said. The outcome of his contacts with representatives of the 
Group of 12 factions led by Ali Mahdi that oppose him seemed 
uncertain. 
  Meanwhile five US congressmen were expected here later 
Saturday for a brief fact-finding tour. Leading the delegation 
is Representative John Murtha, chairman of the House Defence 
Appropriations Committee, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 16 (AFP) -- Elders of Mogadishu's 
main warring clans signed a peace agreement Sunday after three 
days of talks aimed at stopping renewed factional fighting in 
Mogadishu after US forces withdraw. 
  The talks brought together 176 religious leaders and 
"Ugases," or traditional chiefs, from the clans of warlord 
Mohamed Farah Aidid and his enemy self-styled president Ali 
Mahdi Mohamed. 
  Several other smaller clans were also represented. 
  But the warlords themselves did not attend the meeting, 
chaired by a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, 
Mohamoud Omar, revered both by General Aidid's Habr Gedir 
subclan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal. 
  "This is the beginning of a peaceful settlement in Somalia 
and Allah will support us," Imam Mohamoud told reporters after 
the agreement calling for peace between the clans and the return 
of property looted in the civil war was signed at the Kah hotel 
in Ali Mahdi's north Mogadishu enclave. 
  "I believe this meeting was fruitful because the people are 
fed up with war. Ali Mahdi and Aidid are clansmen and so they 
must follow all the agreements reached by their clans," said the 
Imam, wearing a red-and-gold embroidered tunic and white turban 
with black sunglasses. 
  Previous peace accords between the warlords, however, have 
come to nothing, and UN-brokered talks in Addis Ababa last month 
broke up without agreement. 
  But Italian ambassador Mario Scialoja, who visited the Imam 
during the talks Sunday, expressed optimism that pressure was 
building on the warlords to make peace. 
  "I am confident that this agreement between the Habr Gedir 
and the Abgal will lead to reconciliation between the two 
clans," he said before driving away with an Italian military 
escort. 
  "This could lead to a political agreement," Scialoja said. 
"In another few weeks we might reach a breakthrough."

  [Excerpts] This afternoon at a Mogadishu hotel Iman 
Mohamoud Iman Omar officially closed a Hirab [Hawiye] 
communities reconciliation conference. The conference, which 
had been going on for four days, discussed the destruction 
inherited from the civil wars and the attainment of peace and 
total unity. The conference was attended by 176 people 
consisting of chiefs, distinguished people, peace-seekers, 
religious leaders, politicians, intellectuals, officers, and 
youths drawn from these communities. 
  Iman Mohamoud Iman Omar's speech was given due 
consideration. 
An evaluation of living conditions, peace, and other matters 
affecting the communities was also made. 
  The communities decided on the following resolutions: 
Peaceful coexistence should be practiced and any conflict 
should be resolved through joint dialogue; destruction both to 
life and property during the civil wars should be forgotten; 
expropriated properties, be they movable or immovable, should be 
returned to their rightful owners in line with Islamic law; 
roads connecting regions should be opened up for free movement; 
and concerted efforts should be made to combat bandits in line 
with Islamic law. 
  The conference appealed in fraternity and peace to other 
Somali communities to observe peaceful coexistence. The 
conference resolved that a 19-member committee conversant with 
laws and customs be formed. A committee composed of 15 members 
will be formed. Its task will be the implementation of the said 
resolutions. It will start functioning seven days after the 
signing of the agreement. 
  [Passage omitted] The speakers prayed to God to put the 
Somali people on the right path and asked that God inflict His 
curse on those opposed to peace. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking at the closing ceremony, Iman Mohamoud Iman Omar 
thanked the participants for the success of the conference. 
  After the conference concluded, the participants, led by the 
iman, met thousands of people who supported the reconciliation 
meeting and who were lining both sides of the road connecting 
hotels Kah and Towfiq. 
  The conference issued the following appeals: 
  1. In consideration of the common background and the general 
history of society, taking into account the unprecedented 
problems which have affected the brotherly society, and taking 
into account the indispensibility of peaceful coexistence, the 
conference appealed to the great Somali society to implement the 
peace resolutions tirelessly. 
  2. The conference appealed to the Somali communities to live 
together in peace and brotherhood. 
  3. The conference appealed to the people to sort out any 
existing disagreements with a view to attaining peaceful 
coexistence and restoring unity and national dignity. 
  4. The conference appealed to the international community to 
give full assistance to the Somali people so that they will be 
able to overcome the problems of the civil wars and also be able 
to decide on their future. 
  The agreement was signed by 30 heads of the delegations to 
the conference.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Warring Somali factions 
gave mixed reactions Monday to a peace treaty between 
Mogadishu's clans and stressed that it fell far short of 
settling their political differences. 
  Self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed welcomed the 
agreement signed Sunday by traditional leaders of his Abgal 
subclan and the Habr Gedir of his enemy, factional leader 
Mohamed Farah Aidid. "It is the first step in a broad 
peacemaking process," he told reporters. But he added: "We have 
a long way to go," and described the treaty as "fragile and 
delicate." 
  Issa Mohamed Siad, foreign affairs secretary of General 
Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, declined to talk 
to reporters. Appearing to reject the treaty, he sent word 
through an aide that the SNA would not comment on it "because it 
was not a political issue, only an agreement reached at a 
traditional clan gathering." 
  SNA supporter Abdi Abshir Kahiye said the clans could settle 
"small, local issues like punishing criminals," but their 
authority did not extend to "big political questions." 
  The treaty, hammered out by 176 clan elders and religious 
leaders in three days of talks, calls for the clans to live in 
peace, end the division of Mogadishu and return property looted 
during the civil war. 
  But the two warlords themselves neither signed the agreement 
nor attended the talks, reserved for clan elders and closed to 
politicians. 
  A vicious power struggle still divides the two men whose 
fighters gutted Mogadishu in four months of carnage before the 
first US Marines landed in December 1992 to help end a famine 
that cost 300,000 lives. 
  Aidid wants UN troops to quit Somalia. But Ali Mahdi says 
they must stay to prevent renewed civil war after US forces 
withdraw in March, a decision prompted by the killings of 25 
Americans in clashes with Aidid's militiamen. Ali Mahdi said he 
would comply with the treaty and remove his militiamen from the 
Green Line dividing his north Mogadishu enclave from Aidid's 
south Mogadishu stronghold. "I hope Aidid will listen to the 
message of peace," Ali Mahdi said, adding that he was encouraged 
by the presence at the talks of influential clansmen of Aidid, 
currently in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. 
  But in a sign that peace may still be a distant prospect, 
Ali 
Mahdi denied SNA officials' claims that Aidid himself held peace 
talks in Nairobi with representatives of the Group of 12 
factions led by Ali Mahdi. He stressed, however, that faction 
leaders were coming under mounting pressure from the 
rank-and-file to make peace. 
  "We are a clan society," Ali Mahdi said. "If the clan of a 
given political figure or leader opts for peace and chooses the 
road of reconciliation and pacification, I believe that leader 
has to comply with the wishes of his people." 
  Ali Mahdi said the UN's earlier attempts to mediate between 
the clan-based factions had failed. 
  But he stressed that Sunday's treaty was "completely 
different" because it marked "the first time that the community 
leaders have stepped in with all their weight" since factional 
fighting erupted after the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed 
Siad Barre. 
  Ali Mahdi said buses had already started moving freely 
across 
the Green Line only a day after the treaty was signed. 
  Somali residents said they saw little change. Some even 
reported more gunmen than usual in Mogadishu's shell-blitzed 
streets. 
  Ali Mahdi called for an all-clan "national community 
leaders' 
conference" to be held in Mogadishu after talks to win the 
agreement of other, smaller clans that did not sign the treaty.

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 18 (AFP) -- UN forces on Tuesday [18 
January] released eight aides of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid, including his right hand man and chief financier Osman 
Hassan Ali 'Ato'. 
  Minutes after being freed, Osman addressed a rally of about 
2,000 cheering supporters who welcomed him with garlands of 
purple bougainvillaea flowers. "Without you we would never have 
succeeded," Osman, known as 'Ato,' or the slim man told the 
crowd. 
  He did not mention General Aidid's demand for UN 
peacekeepers 
to quit Somalia in what was essentially a non-political speech, 
but promised to address supporters again on Thursday. 
  Osman, 44, was arrested four months ago on suspicion of 
involvement in the killings of US and UN peacekeepers before the 
world body dropped its hunt for Aidid amd suspended a warrant 
for his arrest in November. Osman was held for a time on an 
island off southern Somalia with two other senior Aidid aides, 
Mohamed Hassan Awale, the warlord's advisor on international 
affairs, and Omar Salad Elmi, Aidid's former representative in 
Ethiopia. 
  The latter were arrested during an October 3 firefight in 
which Aidid militiamen killed 18 Americans. The three were 
later moved to the central town of Baidoa. They were flown to 
Mogadishu and handed over to officials of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross on Tuesday along with five other 
lower level Aidid aides who had been detained in the capital. 
  An international law expert who investigated the case 
against 
the eight detainees, Enoch Dumbuntshena of Zimbabwe recommended 
their release after a four day visit to Somalia earlier this 
month, UN officials said. 
  An international commission is still investigating 
allegations that Aidid masterminded the killings of foreign 
soldiers. 
  More than 80 peacekeepers have died since the United Nations 
took over command of the multi-national military intervention 
force in Somalia from the United States in May, most in clashes 
with Aidid's militiamen. 
  "We're happy the detainees have been released and we hope 
that all those will work together for peace with a spirit of 
reconciliation," UN spokesman George Bennett said. Asked 
whether the decision to release the detainees was political or 
judicial, Bennett said it was "humanitarian" gesture. 
  As the eight were being released they met the Imam of Hirab, 
Omar Mohamoud, a revered Islamic leader who brokered a peace 
treaty signed by the clans of Aidid and his enemy, self-styled 
interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed on Sunday. 
  In a statement from Geneva confirming the releases of the 
eight, the ICRC recalled that it had in October last year played 
a role in bringing about the release of a US helicopter pilot 
and a Nigerian soldier held by Aidid supporters. 
  ICRC officials have visited 206 prisoners in UNOSOM hands 
during the past eight months, the statement said.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 17 SAPA -- The government has proposed 
boosting security force manpower in strife-torn townships as 
part of a composite peace plan to be announced later this week, 
State President F W de Klerk said on Monday. He told reporters 
after talks with African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson 
Mandela at the Union Buildings in Pretoria that no final 
decisions had been reached. Solving the violence was an 
all-inclusive process which could not be accomplished on a 
"quick-fix" basis. 
  All parties which had a direct or indirect bearing on the 
violence, including Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom 
Party, had to be consulted, said Mr de Klerk. The government had 
a specific role to prevent violence. Its plan to maintain law 
and order was being discussed with Mr Mandela. Further 
discussions would also take place with the Transitional 
Executive Council, Mr Buthelezi and peace structures. 
  Referring to Mr Mandela's reported call for the withdrawal 
of 
the Internal Stability Division from East Rand townships, Mr de 
Klerk said: "Specific steps to ensure the strengthening of 
(security force) manpower, especially the levels of the South 
African Defence Force's role, are being looked at." 
  Socio-economic problems such as housing and education would 
also be addressed effectively to further stabilise the East Rand. 
  Mr de Klerk also held talks with French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe, informing him about the negotiation process, the 
run-up to the elections and the challenges facing a government 
of national unity. He expressed confidence that the 
complications arising from "significant parties" still being 
outside the process and threatening to boycott the elections 
would be overcome. 
  "We will continue to draw in the other role players and 
through negotiations and agreements search for a solution," he 
said. There was no turning back on the April 27 election date, 
Mr de Klerk added. 
  Mr Juppe said France stood ready to increase its financial 
assistance to South Africa "two-fold" and would step up 
bilateral aid for technology and cultural activities. 
  He invited South Africa to the Franco/African summit to be 
held soon and said France would play a substantial role in 
monitoring the election process. 
  Responding to a question, Mr de Klerk said he was "highly 
critical" of the ANC's economic plans which critics have 
slammed as being tantamount to nationalisation, and would relay 
this message during his election campaign. The plan showed the 
ANC had not made sufficient progress in terms of economic 
realities, he said. 
  He hoped the ANC's decision-making body would steer away 
from 
the calamities which would result if such policies were applied.

<F P=106> [By Billy Paddock] </F>
  [Text] President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National 
Congress] president Nelson Mandela meet at the Union Buildings 
in Pretoria today to finalise details of "the most comprehensive 
peace initiative" government and the ANC have devised in the 
hope of stemming township violence. Both camps are keeping the 
meeting, the second in a week, under wraps. They refused to 
discuss details of the plan, which they said was too sensitive 
at this stage. Mandela and De Klerk have issued instructions to 
their negotiating teams to keep details confidential until the 
plan is finalised. 
  Two key sources confirmed the meeting but warned that the 
final version of the plan "is not a dramatic humdinger that is 
going to solve the violence in one quick-fix, brilliant 
manoeuvre". They refused to divulge details, saying: "Too much 
is resting on this. We have to ensure nothing gets in the way of 
the full agreement both parties are committed to setting up for 
the immediate period and on into the phase after elections." 
  The plan discussed by the two leaders last week was also 
discussed in Cabinet and at the ANC's national working committee 
and its national executive committee meetings last week. 
  The sources said the plan was a step-by-step initiative. It 
relied on building trust and co-operation between government, 
the ANC, the SAP [South African Police], the SADF [South African 
Defence Force], Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC 
military wing], the self-defence units and the internal 
stability unit. Community co-operation would also have an 
important role. 
  Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel has acknowledged that 
the 
internal stability unit needs to be reviewed. The possibility 
of incorporating members of other militias is being discussed. 
The peace talks have led to calls for the unit's withdrawal 
being put on hold. 
  Stephane Bothma reports that Law and Order spokesman Craig 
Kotze said yesterday the number of internal stability unit 
members deployed in East Rand townships could soon be reduced. 
Government was considering alternative policing strategies in 
the area. "We are considering the possibility of assigning 
certain tasks -- not related to normal policing -- to the SADF," 
he said. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party Transvaal leader Themba Khoza said the 
party would strongly oppose such a move, SAPA reports. He said 
Inkatha had made numerous complaints about soldiers being 
deployed in the area after "losing 10 of its members in December 
last year, when 3,000 bullets were fired at civilians in a 
single incident". 
  Inkatha MP Hennie Bekker said the proposal to reduce the 
unit's East Rand presence would be viewed as the "final 
abdication of the NP [National Party] and government to the 
ANC/communist alliance." 
  In a separate development, Inkatha Transvaal deputy chairman 
Humphrey Ndlovu said his organisation would not take part in 
West Rand peace talks brokered by the SA Council of Churches 
[SACC]. 
  Wilson Zwane reports that the proposed talks are aimed at 
reducing tensions in the West Rand township of Bekkersdal. A 
boycott of businesses in neighbouring Westonaria was called by 
the ANC and AZAPO [Azanian People's Organization] last month in 
protest at the presence of the internal stability unit and SADF 
troops in the township. 
  Ndlovu said the SACC was prejudiced against Inkatha, whose 
members it did not "regard as human beings". He added: 
"Churches affiliated to the SACC refuse to bury Inkatha 
supporters and to allow Inkatha to use their buildings for 
meetings." Because of this "bias", Inkatha was not taking part 
in talks. 
  SACC spokesman Bernard Spong said Ndlovu's statement was to 
be regretted as the SACC was impartial. 
  Also at today's talks, Mandela and De Klerk and their 
respective chief negotiators, Cyril Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer, 
will discuss negotiations with the Freedom Alliance and ways of 
drawing Inkatha into a settlement. 
  De Klerk is insistent that the final deadline for changes to 
the constitution is next Monday. He has to sign the 
constitution into law by the end of January to meet the 90-day 
deadline before elections. 
  De Klerk will meet King Goodwill Zwelithini this afternoon 
at 
the king's request to discuss the role of a Zulu kingdom and 
KwaZulu under the new constitution. It is understood that De 
Klerk is likely to tell him that regions will have the power to 
draft their own constitutions.

  [Text] A solution to bring peace to the violence-racked 
East Rand hasn't been found. State President F.W. de Klerk and 
ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson Mandela met 
again today to discuss the issue and indicated that other 
parties would have to be consulted. 
  [Begin recording] [De Klerk] The government has a specific 
role to play with regard to law and order and the prevention of 
violence. We've discussed our plans in that regard with Mr. 
Mandela. We will be discussing those plans also with the 
Transitional Executive Council. I will also be discussing them 
with Chief Minister Buthelezi because of the importance of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party in the conflict situation. We will be 
discussing it with the peace structures. 
  [Reporter Linda van Tilburg] Mr. De Klerk was commenting on 
his talks with Mr. Mandela this morning after meeting with 
French Foreign Minister, Mr. Alain Juppe. He indicated that an 
announcement could be made on addressing the East Rand violence 
by the end of the week. The president wouldn't confirm whether 
the Internal Stability Unit would be withdrawn from the East 
Rand, but said security force numbers could be boosted in 
strife-torn townships. Mr. Mandela was whisked away from the 
Union Buildings after refusing to talk about what had transpired 
during the meeting. He told TV news the issue was extremely 
sensitive. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 17 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk and 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini have agreed that a working group 
be formed to urgently address ways in which the Zulu monarchy 
and kwaZulu Kingdom could be recognised and assured. After 
three hours of talks in Pretoria, they said in a joint 
communique the possibilities for this included constitutional 
options and multiparty agreements. Other issues of a more 
general nature would be discussed at multiparty negotiations 
that have been arranged for this week, Mr De Klerk said. 
  The communique said the king had expressed his concern at 
the 
lack of recognition for the position of the Zulu monarchy and 
kwaZulu in the transitional constitution. Mr De Klerk had 
assured the king of his high consideration for the king, the 
Zulu monarchy and the Kingdom of kwaZulu, and pointed out that 
adequate provision could be made for the entrenchment of these 
institutions in the envisaged provincial constitution. "He (Mr 
De Klerk) committed himself to support these institutions as 
strongly as he could," the joint statement said. 
  Mr De Klerk said he regretted the incidents of violence 
which 
surrounded the Zulu supporters' trek to Pretoria on Monday. He 
sincerely hoped the guilty would be brought to book. Political 
differences should be resolved democratically and not through 
force, he said. 
  Police estimated 35,000 Zulu supporters went to the Union 
Buildings in support of their king. 
  Mr De Klerk said he and his ministers had also consulted the 
Zulu delegation, which included Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on the framework for ending East 
Rand violence. Mr Buthelezi would reply to the proposals on 
Tuesday. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he also regretted the incidents of 
violence 
but the gathering at the Union Buildings had been voluntary and 
the IFP had had nothing to do with the event. The IFP opposed 
stayaways and it was not its policy to intimidate people. 
  On the participation of the Zulu people in the elections, 
King Zwelithini said that depended on how the issues discussed 
on Monday were handled. Mr Buthelezi added that the stance of 
his party was reflected by the Freedom Alliance's position. 
  Mr De Klerk said the government was not totally opposed to 
the double-ballot system, a major concern of the Zulu 
delegation. The issue would be discussed at multiparty talks 
this week. 
  The bilateral discussions with the Zulu kingdom would 
necessarily have to be broadened to multilateral discussions if 
they were to be fruitful, but that would not necessarily affect 
the January 24 Freedom Alliance talks deadline, said Mr De 
Klerk. However, the position of kwaZulu and the king had to be 
addressed with a great sense of urgency and well before the 
election. 
  Negotiations on outstanding points had become crucial and 
the 
government would approach them with a sense of urgency. 
Government was committed to "try to really find solutions on a 
multiparty basis which can ensure the inclusion of all 
significant parties in the electoral process", Mr De Klerk said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 16 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress (PAC) was suspending the armed struggle it has been 
conducting through its military wing, the Azanian People's 
Liberation Army (APLA), PAC President Clarence Makwetu said on 
Sunday. The move opens the way for the PAC to take part in the 
April 27 election and for the inclusion of APLA members in a 
national peacekeeping force. 
  Mr Makwetu said the decision had been taken by the PAC's 
National Working Committee in the light of the promulgation of 
the Electoral Act and decisions reached at its annual conference 
in December last year. "The leadership of APLA has started the 
process of informing its cadres throughout the country of this 
decision," Mr Makwetu said in a statement. 
  He said the PAC would pursue negotiations with the 
government 
to reach a mutual cessation of hostilities and to secure amnesty 
for APLA cadres in jail and exile. "We will also continue to 
negotiate with the regime and other parties to get all the armed 
formations in this country, including the South African Defence 
Force and the South African Police, under joint control. APLA 
will not disband until these goals have been reached." He said 
the PAC expected other armed formations to respond in kind. 
  A unilateral decision had been taken because the government 
was dragging out negotiations with the PAC and finding excuses 
to continue killing PAC members and raiding its offices, he 
said. "Because of our commitment to peace and free and fair 
elections, we are taking the regime's excuse and taking the 
initiative to create a climate to allow for further 
negotiations." 
  Mr Makwetu said the PAC would register as a political party 
and unveil its list of candidates and election manifesto within 
weeks. He said he remained confident of substantial support for 
the PAC in the elections in spite of opinion polls which give it 
little hope in the poll. 
  Negotiations, in particular on joint control of all armed 
formations, would determine whether the PAC would join the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC). However, the TEC Act 
stipulates that only TEC members are eligible to have their 
soldiers included in a joint peacekeeping force. 
  The PAC move follows pressure from Tanzania and Zimbabwe on 
the PAC to rejoin the constitutional process and a threat by 
those countries to act against the PAC if APLA continued to 
operate from those territories, formerly supporters of its war 
on the South African Government. 
  Mr Makwetu said he could not rule out any further APLA 
attacks as it would take some time before all APLA cadres were 
informed of the decision.

  [Text] The government and the ANC [African National 
Congress] have welcomed the announcement by the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] that it is to suspend its armed 
struggle. The announcement comes after pressure on the 
organization by Tanzania and Zimbabwe to abide by the principles 
of peaceful negotiation. 
  Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel has said it's high time 
that the PAC and its armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army], realized that violence and democracy do not 
mix. 
  ANC Spokesman, Carl Niehaus, welcomed the announcement, but 
said the organization's executive committee was studying it 
before making a full statement.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Today's decision by the Pan-Africanist Congress, 
PAC, of South Africa, to suspend its armed struggle has been 
widely welcomed by both the South African Government and the ANC 
[African National Congress]. The PAC's armed wing, the Azanian 
People's Liberation Front, APLA, is against the negotiated 
package of reforms, and attacks police officers and 
predominantly white venues in its fight against white rule. The 
PAC's decision follows widespread condemnation of its violent 
tactics from within and outside South Africa, including 
Tanzania, which on Tuesday [11 January] barred APLA from 
launching attacks from its territory. On the line to 
Johannesburg, Audrey Brown asked Thobile Gola, deputy secretary 
general of the PAC, why they have decided to suspend the armed 
struggle now. 
  [Begin recording] [Gola] Now that the Electoral Act was 
promulgated this week, we had to prepare ourselves for 
elections, and it is not feasible that you shoot this side and 
you campaign for elections this side. For the sake of peace and 
free and fair elections we wanted the PAC to be cleared of all 
forms of hostilities or so-called violence, so that they will 
remove all excuses that will deny the PAC an opportunity to 
participate freely in the elections. 
  [Brown] Could the adverse [word indistinct] are recent, and 
I 
say to you: The question of the PAC pursuing negotiations on the 
ending of hostilities started as far back as 1990. So, we are 
not really influenced by any recent bad publicity or attacks on 
white people. The PAC has all along been working toward a mutual 
ending of all hostilities by all the parties in conflict -- that 
is, the regime and APLA in this case. But, that has not worked 
out. But now we are facing elections. It is our own decision 
to participate, and therefore we decided today to declare what 
we call a unilateral moratorium on armed struggle. 
  [Brown] So, does that mean that in your negotiations with 
the 
government you did not obtain mutual cessation of hostilities, 
as you call it? 
  [Gola] It has not been formally agreed. The negotiations 
with the regime will continue. We shall pursue those 
negotiations to reach a formal mutual cessation and get all that 
we need from them -- the amnesty for all those people who are in 
prison and all those who are still in exile, and, of course, 
talk about what to do with the armed formations in the country. 
That agenda still stands and the regime was been dillydallying 
all the time when we demanded these meetings. 
  [Brown] But doesn't this weaken your position, the fact that 
you suspended your armed struggle now, because it seems like 
your main trump card against them was that you could launch 
attacks against them? 
  [Gola] No, our position is not weakened at all. The first 
thing you must understand is that by declaring ourselves ready 
to go to elections, we needed a climate of peace in the country. 
We feel that we are not weakened. Actually, we are 
strengthening our position by taking that direction. 
  [Brown] But it is possible to see that in another light. It 
is possible to see it in the sense that the PAC is coming under 
growing pressure and it is losing support by pursuing an armed 
struggle and that is why you had to declare your suspension now? 
  [Gola] I am not sure about losing support. I do not know 
from whom are we losing support. We are pursuing a program 
here, and a decision was taken by the highest organ of the PAC 
to prepare for elections. 
  [Brown] Is there a sense of sadness in the PAC or amongst 
people that the armed struggle has been given up, because it 
seems like it was, you know, one of the things that the 
organization prided itself in, in that it was fighting back, it 
was fighting the South African Government? 
  [Gola] I have not received any report to say some people 
feel 
bad about it or feel sad, and therefore I am not worried about 
whatever fears you might have. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 17 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples' 
Liberation Army [APLA] will continue its liberation struggle 
until its demands have been met, a caller claiming to be APLA 
Internal Commander Karl Zimbiri told SAPA in a telephone call on 
Monday evening. Mr Zimbiri, who identified himself to SAPA 
using a pre- arranged code, said regional and sectional 
commanders as well as ground forces of the Pan Africanist 
Congress' [PAC] armed wing had met in Bloemfontein for five 
hours on Monday. "We want it to be known that we are not 
uncontrollable," he said. 
  Asked if the three men killed in an attack on a police 
station in central Durban early on Monday were APLA members, he 
said he did not want to make any claims and would "leave this to 
the media's imagination". 
  While he respected PAC President Clarence Makwetu's decision 
to end the armed struggle, it was premature of him to announce 
this before the conclusion of APLA's negotiations with the South 
African Defence Force. "We will strike tomorrow and today...We 
are always on the offensive." 
  Mr Zimbiri said the ball was in the SADF's court. APLA would 
not surrender its arms to the "minority (President F W) de Klerk 
settler regime" until its demands had been met. These included 
a United Nations peace-keeping force, he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 17 SAPA -- Three callers, all 
claiming to be Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] leaders, 
told the South African Press Association on Monday night the 
armed struggle would continue. The first, who claimed he was 
APLA Internal Commander Karl Zimbiri and used a pre-arranged 
codeword, said regional and sectional commanders as well as 
ground forces of the Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] armed wing 
had met in Bloemfontein for five hours earlier in the day. 
While he respected PAC leader Clarence Makwetu, it was 
premature for Mr Makwetu to announce a moratorium in APLA's 
armed struggle. "We will strike tommorrow and today...We are 
always on the offensive," he said. 
  Later on Monday night two men, calling within seconds of one 
another and claiming to be APLA commanders, also rejected any 
cessation of hostilities. Neither was aware of an identifying 
codeword. 
  The man who said he was Ropa Hondo, "commander of special 
forces", stated: "APLA will not suspend the armed struggle and 
it is not true we have started to tell our forces on ground to 
prepare for a ceasefire or moratorium." Mr Hondo said he was 
calling from Grahamstown. "More blood will be spilled until the 
land is returned to its rightful owners, the toiling masses of 
Azania," he declared. Caller Hondo claimed APLA had always been 
suspicious of the PAC's participation in the World Trade Centre 
negotiations in Kempton Park and viewed the talks with contempt. 
  Within seconds, [words indistinct] told SAPA Mr Makwetu's 
decision had not been welcomed "by me or by forces on ground". 
"Claims that the APLA leadership has begun informing cadres of 
the moratorium is a lie," caller Haladi said. He added that the 
PAC was moving away from its original policy of armed struggle, 
and that the decision to suspend the fight had been made by 
bourgeoisie politicians. "The armed struggle will continue 
until our people have bread and their freedom."

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 16 SAPA -- State President FW de 
Klerk on Sunday welcomed the Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] 
announcement that it has suspended its armed struggle, saying 
the decision would be conducive to bilateral negotiations. "I 
think it's a wise decision," Mr De Klerk said on the CCV 
[Contemporary Community Values] programme Newsline. "That now, 
to my mind, prepares the table for further negotiations between 
us as a government and the PAC with regard to practical 
matters," he said. 
  Mr De Klerk expressed the hope that the decision would be 
obeyed by cadres of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, the 
PAC's military wing. "I really do hope that they succeed in 
disciplining the APLA people to obey their policy decision and 
to fall in line and to also in practise stop with violent 
actions and planning violent deeds and making attacks."

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has lashed out 
at Inkatha. The ANC has accused the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
of abusing the position of the Zulu king and the name of the 
Zulu people to further the political objectives of the IFP and 
its leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  A statement from ANC Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimande says 
yesterday's march on the Union Buildings in Pretoria was part of 
the continued abuse of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Nzimande 
said the fact of the matter is that people who marched to 
Pretoria yesterday were IFP members and not the entire Zulu 
nation. He's also expressed the ANC's condemnation of violence 
and thuggery that occurred. He says the ANC regards yesterday's 
behavior of the IFP as a dress rehearsal of national 
destabilization in the future.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 18 SAPA -- The danger of violence 
destabilising the process to democracy should not be 
underestimated, African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson 
Mandela said on Tuesday. Addressing a joint news conference with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in Pretoria, he said there 
were minority groups which were not only concerned about their 
future and values, but which were determined to arrest all 
movement to a democratic future. It was the democratic 
movement's duty to address the fears of all South Africans, 
including those of minorities. 
  Mr Mandela said an holistic strategy should be applied to 
solve the violence. The plan discussed with President F W de 
Klerk could be jeopardised if details were published 
prematurely, because it involved a number of parties. But Mr 
Mandela said measures could include a region being declared a 
disaster area, that the entire community be involved in 
upgrading programmes, and that hostels be turned into family 
units. 
  Tremendous progress had been made in building a new South 
Africa, and there were many people who were determined to 
contribute to this process. The ANC would continue trying to 
involve the Freedom Alliance and other parties in the elections, 
but would proceed without them if necessary. 
  Polls which indicated a landslide election victory for the 
ANC were encouraging, said Mr Mandela but warned against 
complacency. The ANC should be on its toes, for while the 
government might be tagged as illegitimate, paralyzed by 
corruption, and accused of orchestrating violence, it remained 
devastatingly effective in elections. 
  The ANC's National Executive Committee would seriously and 
sympathetically consider an invitation from France for South 
Africa to join the Franco-African Conference, to be held in 
Paris this year. 
  Mr Juppe announced France was prepared to assist in training 
the national peacekeeping force. He added that few countries 
were interested in improving links with Africa, and were looking 
instead at the Pacific Rim or Latin America, but France would 
not forget Africa, and this would ensure a basis for 
co-operation.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Whitfield, political correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] (AVF) leader 
General Constand Viljoen -- under growing pressure from 
supporters for decisive action -- has warned that the nature of 
the struggle to achieve self-determination "may change in the 
near future". 
  In a statement issued yesterday, Viljoen said the next two 
weeks would provide clarity, but there were "strong indications 
that the Afrikaner will shortly stand before his toughest choice 
of the century". He rejected recent suggestions that his 
position in the AVF had been weakened and that he might quit the 
organisation. A right-wing source said recent comments by 
Viljoen were simply an indication that he believed his political 
role might be ending: "I imagine he was hinting at a military 
role he might have to play," said the source. 
  He said there was "concern, discontent and frustration" 
among 
grassroots supporters at the lack of progress in negotiations 
with the Government and the ANC [African National Congress]. 
They were saying to the AVF leadership: "I told you so...there 
is no alternative to war." However, Viljoen said in his 
statement that his role was not changing because of 
dissatisfaction over his performance but because the ANC and 
Government were limiting the options open to Afrikaners. The 
fact that the nature of the struggle could change soon was not 
his fault, but that of the Government and ANC who thought they 
were dealing with people who "bark but don't bite". He also 
claimed that the Government had shocked him by negotiating in a 
"spineless" manner with the ANC and had been dishonest in its 
dealings with the AVF.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 16 SAPA -- He was not aware of any 
specific, ultra-rightwing threat to his life, General Constand 
Viljoen, co-leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] 
(AVF), said on Sunday. Reacting to reports that police had 
warned him of an ultra-rightwing plot to assassinate him, Gen 
Viljoen said he had not been given any specific information 
about such a threat. 
  He conceded though, that times were becoming dangerous, and 
that some sources said there was a threat from the African 
National Congress [ANC] side, others said from 
ultra-rightwingers, while others said it was government 
information which should be treated with circumspection. He 
knew of no specific threat against him, and his security 
arrangements remained on a normal level. 
  Turning to suggestions of rightwing disenchantment with his 
leadership, and talk that he was a government agent to moderate 
the rightwing, Gen Viljoen said he had long been aware of such 
talk, and saw it as part of a campaign to discredit him. "They 
will do anything to alienate me." 
  Gen Viljoen also dismissed suggestions that he may be on the 
verge of stepping down from his AVF position, saying he was 
committed to establishing a volkstaat [nation state] for his 
people. He said he had become disenchanted with the political 
vacillations of the National Party and the ANC, which made 
about- turns during negotiations for a volkstaat. 
  Gen Viljoen said he had never been expected to provide 
political leadership for the AVF, but strategic guidance. 
  If the government decided not to accommodate the Freedom 
Alliance [FA], the FA should discuss its future options. Asked 
what these options would be, he said: "Your guess is as good as 
mine."

  [Text] Inkatha will oppose a proposed withdrawal of the 
police's Internal Stability Unit [ISU] from the East Rand 
townships. Transvaal IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Themba 
Khosa says his organization will also oppose the planned 
replacement of the controversial ISU with SADF [South African 
Defense Force] units. He was reacting to a statement by the Law 
and Order Ministr?}he 'overnment is considering red ucing ISU 
members on`? Ra6d because of the continued instability in the 
region. The ministry said it's possible that the ISU could be 
replaced by soldiers. 
  The announcement is thought to arise from Tuesday's meeting 
between Nelson Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk. The ANC 
[African National Congress] leader went to that meeting with a 
number of proposals to end violence. Khosa says the IFP has 
made 7Hcomplaints about soldiers killing 10 of its members in 
December last year and 3,000 ?ere fired at civilians in a single 
incident. The IFP leader says it's well known that th?e causing 
problems in Katlehong are mem bers of the ANC's armed wing and 
its self-defense units.

  [Text] Durban Jan 17 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] has taken "strong exception" to reports linking it to 
widespread intimidation ahead of Zulu King goodwill Zwelithini's 
meeting with President F W de Klerk in Pretoria on Monday. IFP 
spokesman Ed Tillett said in a statement the party had distanced 
itself last week from the call to Zulus to stay away from work 
on Monday and dissociated itself from all acts of intimidation. 
  "The IFP has always campaigned against coercion to enforce 
stayaways and is not about to bow to political expedience on 
this principle," Mr Tillett said. 
  The call for a national Zulu stayaway had been made by the 
United Independent Trade Unions ad hoc committee of South Africa 
-- an umbrella grouping representing 10 independent trade unions 
-- after they had "canvassed the feelings of their members". 
  "Insofar as township residents on the reef linking alleged 
intimidators to the IFP, it must be remembered that all 'zulus' 
on the reef are arbitrarily labelled 'Inkathas' by non-Zulus, 
irrespective of whether they are card-carrying members or 
supporters of the IFP or not," Mr Tillett said.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] Women's League 
[ANCWL] president Winnie Mandela emerged as the most popular 
woman candidate on the ANC's national list of 200 candidates for 
Parliament presented at the organisation's nominations 
conference this weekend. 
  The ANC's national executive committee ruled that her 
kidnapping conviction would be classed as a political offence 
and she was therefore eligible to stand for Parliament. 
  More than 500 delegates from the ANC and its Patriotic Front 
allies met at a Johannesburg hotel yesterday to cast their final 
vote for national representatives to stand in the April 27 
election. 
  The ANC's list of 200 candidates, which was compiled in 
December last year, will be altered slightly to accommodate 
candidates proposed by the Patriotic Front organisations. 
  The list of national candidates was drawn up after months of 
branch and regional conferences involving thousands of 
ANC-alliance members. The process cost over R[rand]2-million. 
  The ANC's list shows overwhelming support for the ANC 
negotiators and has a strong racial and language mix. 
  ANC president Nelson Mandela tops the provisional list. 
International relations head Thabo Mbeki, secretary general 
Cyril Ramaphosa, SACP [South African Communist Party] chairman 
Joe Slovo, former Cosatu boss Jay Naidoo and senior negotiator 
Mohammed Vallie Moosa are in the top 10. Other candidates who 
received popular support were Transkei military leader 
Major-General Bantu Holomisa, Natal Midlands leader Harry Gwala 
and former Youth League president Peter Mokaba. 
  In addition to Mrs Mandela, women candidates with much 
support were former Women's League secretary general Baleka 
Kgositsile, Hilda Ndude and Adelaide Tambo. Popular Western 
Cape executive member Cheryl Carolus, who was mooted as a 
possible Health Minister in a future cabinet, this week withdrew 
her name from the list saying she wanted to work on health 
issues. 
  In addition to finalising the list of 200 candidates for the 
national assembly, the ANC has drawn up a list of 200 regional 
representatives for the national assembly and its list of 
candidates for the provincial legislatures. 
  Seven candidates for the provincial premierships have 
already 
been decided, but contenders still have to be chosen for the 
Western and North West. 
  In the Western Cape, Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; 
MK -- ANC military wing] militant Tony Yengeni and the more 
moderate Dr Allan Boesak are set to fight it out for the ANC 
nomination today. 
  Dr Boesak is expected to trounce Mr Yengeni. 
  The Western Cape premier nominations have been the scene of 
continuing battles between pragmatists who see Dr Boesak as the 
organisation's best chance to capture coloured voters and 
militants who see him as too moderate and unattractive to voters. 
  Mr Yengeni, an MK hardliner who is close to Mrs Mandela, was 
deposed as ANC Western Cape secretary last year after a fiery 
battle at the organisation's regional congress. 
  North West nominee Essop Pahad declined to stand this week, 
saying he felt he would not be the best person to attract ANC 
votes in the province. However, ANC sources have suggested the 
SACP secretariat instructed him to turn down the nomination. 
ANC election official Popo Molefe is being mooted as a possible 
candidate in Mr Pahad's place. 
  The ANC's deputy secretary-general Jacob Zuma is the ANC's 
choice for premier in Natal after beating the militant Natal 
Midlands leader Harry Gwala and southern Natal chairman Jeff 
Radebe. 
  The other candidates for premierships are Tokyo Sexwale for 
the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], former UDF 
[United Democratic Front] secretary general Terror Lekota for 
the Free State, the late Oliver Tambo's speech writer Ngoako 
Ramatlhodi for the Northern Transvaal, legal department head 
Matthew Phosa for the Eastern Transvaal, Mane Dipico for the 
Northern Cape, and SACP central committee member and former 
Robben Island prisoner Raymond Mhlaba for the Eastern Cape. 
  Despite the voting at this weekend's conference, the ANC's 
national executive could make further changes to the list this 
week if they wish to include more women or candidates from areas 
which are not well represented.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 16 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress's [ANC] dream for a non-racial democracy would die if 
the movement was defeated in the Western Cape, ANC Western Cape 
regional chairman, Dr Allan Boesak, said on Sunday. He had just 
been elected the ANC candidate for premiership of the new 
Western Cape Provincial Government at a special conference held 
at the University of the Western Cape. The post of premier will 
replace the current provincial administratorship after the April 
27 elections. 
  Dr Boesak beat his only opponent, legal and constitutional 
expert Dullah Omar, by 136 votes to 120. 
  Branch representatives of the ANC, the Congress of SA [South 
African] Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party cast their 
votes after a number of other candidates withdrew from the race. 
Dr Boesak said that in the coming election the Western Cape 
would be the test for the ANC's non-racial character. "If we 
loose this election the dream for a non-racial democracy, for 
the rest of our country as well, will die here. It is our 
responsibility to set the tone for the non-racial democracy 
which this country must become." 
  He said the reconstruction and development the ANC had 
spoken 
of would also be put into practice in this region. "That talk 
has not just been for elections," he said.

  [Text] The government is not prepared to abandon its idea 
of a single ballot paper for the April election despite the 
objections of the Freedom Alliance. The government's chief 
negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, said a single ballot paper was the 
sole option in view of the extent of voter illiteracy and 
uncertainty. 
  During his talks with President F.W. de Klerk yesterday, 
King 
Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus repeated that separate ballot 
papers were a condition for the Zulu participation in the 
election. The question will be high on the agenda when the 
Freedom Alliance holds talks with the government and the ANC

  [Text] Durban Jan 17 SAPA -- The African National Congress 
[ANC] in northern Natal has again called for security forces to 
take over policing in the region where, it claims, at least four 
people have been killed since Saturday. In a statement on 
Monday, it said the latest flashpoint in the region was 
Buchanana near Ntambanana, about 30km east of Empangeni. The 
statement said renewed violence started on January 9 when ANC 
member Bheki Ndlovu was killed in an ambush. "Despite the fact 
that the kwaZulu Police [KZP] were patrolling the area during 
the same evening, attacks continued." Several homes had been 
gutted by fire in a series of attacks since then, the ANC 
claimed. 
  Two supporters were killed during Mr Ndlovu's funeral on 
Saturday. They were identified by the ANC as Wiseman Cele and 
Phakaniseni Hlela. 
  On Monday morning Thokozani Patrick Mlondo and Joshua 
Mofokeng were shot dead by a group which opened fire before 
burning several houses, the statement said. 
  The ANC demanded the South African Police and the defence 
force immediately take over policing in the Ntambanana area. It 
also called on the Goldstone Commission to investigate the 
latest violence. 
  The KZP confirmed weekend incidents in the area but was 
unable to supply details on Monday. Senior policemen in Ulundi 
were unavailable late on Monday to comment on the ANC's claims.

  [Text] Bloemfontein Jan 18 SAPA -- An explosion in a

extensive damage to the African National Congress [ANC] office 
and adjacent shops, police reported. No one was injured. 
  [Orange] Free State liaison officer Maj Johlene van der 
Merwe 
told SAPA on Tuesday the blast occurred at about 10PM and was 
believed to have been caused by commercial explosives attached 
to the front of the building on the ground floor in President 
Street. 
  Police counted 69 windows shattered in the offices and 
adjacent chemist and fashion shop. No estimate of the damage 
was available. 
  Maj van der Merwe said police were investigating and 
believed 
the explosion was related to a similar blast at the ANC offices 
in Harrismith on Saturday.

  [Text] According to new legislation, approximately 1.2 
million farm workers have the right to join trade unions and to 
negotiate better service conditions. According to a spokesman 
for COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], the 
legislation follows a long struggle with the South African 
Agricultural Union [SAAU] and the government. The struggle was 
partly won last year after COSATU and Nactu [National Council of 
Trade Unions] forced the SAAU and the government to, among 
others things, extend the law on basic service conditions to the 
agricultural sector. Negotiations on the introduction of labor 
courts are still continuing. 
  [Begin COSATU spokesman Mike Madlala recording in English] 
Farm workers would now be in a position to bargain with their 
own employers, and if there is a deadlock on whatever bargaining 
that is taking place there will be procedures that would guide 
both parties as to what do they have to do in such events. [end 
recording] 
  A spokesman for the SAAU welcomed the legislation and said 
that for the first time there are official deadlock-breaking 
mechanisms.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Sparks] </F>
  [Text] After more than five years of publishing the 
viewpoint of progressive Afrikaners, court judgments and a 
shortage of money have forced Vrye Weekblad to close from 
February 2, editor Max du Preez said yesterday. Foremost among 
the problems faced by the newspaper was a R[rand]1.5 million 
defamation suit brought against it and the Weekly Mail by former 
police forensics chief Lieutenant-General Lothar Neethling. 
  The papers published stories in 1989 linking Neethling to 
death squad activities by allegedly providing poisons and 
knockout drops to former police captain Dirk Coetzee. The 
Supreme Court found the stories were true on overwhelming 
probability, a judgment that was overturned by the Appeal Court. 
The amount of compensation still has to be determined. 
  Du Preez was unrepentant, saying he would not have done 
anything different. "Our closure will leave a vacuum, but we 
played an interesting role. My regret is not being part of the 
election coverage. This effectively gives Nasionale Pers a 
monopoly of election coverage in the Afrikaans press." 
  Du Preez and his 10 editorial staff members are now looking 
for jobs, but he added that he had been approached last year to 
present one edition of AGENDA on TV1 each week.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  Life Under ANC Rule -- "The national SUNDAY TIMES opinion 
poll -- one of the most comprehensive polls ever conducted in 
this country -- brings a dash of cold reality to a political 
debate that has until now been wrapped in delusion and political 
deceit," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 16 
January in a page 16 editorial. "The ANC [African National 
Congress] wins hands down, not only nationally but in seven of 
the nine provinces, and perhaps in all of them." De Klerk's 
ability to defend minority interests is doubted due to his own 
party's weak showing in the poll, while a question is also 
raised over the ANC's adherence to democratic principles. "Deep 
sceptism abouth the ANC's devotion to democracy is 
understandable, especially while the ANC horse carries its SACP 
[South African Communist Party] jockey, but it's the best we 
have," especially in light of the poll results showing the Pan 
Africanist Congress, PAC, as blacks second choice. "Those 
whites who see Mr Mandela as the devil incarnate .... might 
reflect: it could be worse. This analysis defines rather 
neatly the task which lies ahead for the minority communities, 
and especially the white community: it is to help the ANC, 
after April 27, to make South Africa work," otherwise the 
country faces the possible "capture of power by a radical black 
nationalist PAC." What the country needs now is "a new breed of 
subtle men and women" like Finance Minister Derek Keys, who has 
shown how "honest consultation and wise diplomacy" can "woo the 
ANC towards success." 
<H6>  SUNDAY STAR </H6>
  ANC Urged To Campaign Honestly -- "Optimism about the future 
is understandable, particularly among South Africa's millions of 
unemployed black youth," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY STAR in 
English on 16 January in a page 26 editorial. "Now with 
democracy just months away they believe the new government is 
going to improve education and provide jobs. And do this 
overnight. There is every reason to believe the ANC is going to 
try its damndest to deliver the goods, but it's going to take 
time, and the going will be tough," therefore, "the ANC must not 
make promises it cannot keep. The ANC must prepare the 
understandably impatient youth for the realities it will face 
when it moves into the Union Buildings in three months' time." 
"If it promises the earth and can't deliver in the short term, 
there's going to be more than heartache as a result," concludes 
the SUNDAY STAR. 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Right Wing Alliance Pursuit for Homeland -- "At the end of 
last year, when the right wing began their hesitant dialogue 
with the African National Congress, General Constand Viljoen 
declared that they would [word indistinct] in a page 8 
editorial. "Just a few weeks later the very same general and 
his co-leaders were forced to throw in the towel; the ANC was 
also not going to give it to them. Now they are looking at 
`other ways' of achieving their homeland." "The Freedom 
Alliance, and in particular right-wing Afrikaners, must realize 
that one door after another is being closed to them because they 
are failing to use their options and come forward with realistic 
plans. The government realized a while ago that the right wing 
rarely used a rational approach. Now Mr. Nelson Mandela is 
apparently also beginning to discover this. It is necessary for 
everyone to realize that the losers will not be those on whose 
behalf Messrs Mandela and De klerk speak. It will be Messrs 
Buthelezi, Viljoen, Hartzenberg, and Mangope's followers who, 
because of the shortsighted actions of their leaders, are being 
defined out of the creation process of the new politics. Even 
Ciskei's Oupa Gqozo could see that." 
  Black Matriculants' Performance `Pathetic' -- A second 
editorial on the same page of BEELD says that "the pathetic 
performance of black matriculants in the end-of-year 
examinations surprises no one. The tragedy was foretold during 
the course of last year. Now the bitter fruit of timely 
warnings, which no one heeded, are being plucked. It is true 
that black education is not up to standard. Yet at those black 
schools where discipline was maintained, students did very well. 
There were even schools where all the matriculants passed their 
examinations. The political misuse of pupils, vandalism, 
organized stayaways by pupils, and strikes by teachers, who act 
only in self-interest, were the offenders who contributed most 
to the poor results. Fortunately, it seems that those who 
caused the anarchy are beginning to come to their senses. The 
Congress of South African Students has called on pupils to 
return to school and cultivate a culture of learning, and the 
South African Democratic Teachers' Union has committed itself to 
a disruption-free school year in 1994."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  "The ANC [African National Congress] programme of 
reconstruction deserves careful appraisal, not knee-jerk 
rejection," begins the editorial on page 8 of the 17 January 
edition of Johannesburg THE STAR in English. The editorial 
admits that some people fear the ANC document outlining its 
reconstruction and development plans "signals regression to the 
ANC's earlier infatuation with socialism and nationalization." 
"Those anxieties," THE STAR continues, "should be tempered by 
the knowledge that the programme is the product of hours of 
debate." The editorial notes that the ANC program rests on 
"three pillars": "that 'lavish wealth and abject poverty' 
coexist; that these inequalities coincide largely with race and 
are the product of decades of apartheid; and that market forces 
alone will not rectify the legacy of apartheid and that, 
consequently, a state programme of reconstruction and 
development is indispensable." According to THE STAR, those 
propositions "are reasonable, perhaps even indisputable." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  The "Comment" column on page 8 of the Johannesburg SOWETAN 
in 
English on 17 January views the Pan-Africanist Congress's [PAC] 
decision to suspend its armed struggle: "The PAC's stand is to 
be commended as it spells the reduction of the level of 
v??cially from its youthful but militant constituencies which 
could be exploited by forces bent [words indistinct].

  PAC Decision To End Armed Struggle Welcome -- The 
Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) decision to end the armed struggle 
"is an excellent development," declares a page 12 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 18 January. "Yes, many 
South Africans will feel angered at Clarence Makwetu's blithe 
announcement, after years of disingenuously denying that the PAC 
had any control over its armed wing." Although the cease fire 
will "take some time to come into force" we "can look forward to 
less killing." The country can "look with some confidence 
towards a more inclusive election." Ultimately, the "legitimacy 
of the transition process has been bolstered by Makwetu's 
announcement." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Economic Promises -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English 
on 18 January in a page 4 editorial finds the African National 
Congress (ANC) alliance's Reconstruction and Development Program 
"more specific about the promises" it is making. But, "is it 
specific enough about the macroeconomic context in which they 
will be delivered?" "It is not enough to say that 'undue 
inflation' and balance of payments problems should be avoided. 
An overheating economy, with soaring inflation and high 
imports, could bring the programme to a premature end. A 
stronger commitment is needed on macroeconomic discipline, as 
unpalatable as that might be politically." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Editorial Calls for Moderate Front Against ANC -- The 
"Comment" column on page 14 of Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 
on 16 January analyzes the ANC's election manifesto and its 
"so-called program of reconstruction" which it says "even 
frightens political appeasers of the past year. Even the most 
optimistic of them can no longer believe what they had earlier 
announced with great positiveness: That the ANC has renounced 
nationalization and that it had become a protagonist of a free 
market system with a little tinge of socialism merely for the 
sake of its constituency." Hopefully it will make those who 
applauded Mr. Mandela's so-called "assurance" more careful. It 
appears that as election day draws closer, and the ANC feels 
increasingly assured of an election victory, "the organization 
is bent on getting its grip on any support it can get hold of -- 
from education to mines, from land ownership to the civil 
service." "It is a good thing that the ANC's ominous future plan 
for totalitarian state control and interference became known 
just in time -- in time by all moderate people and parties 
involved in the present negotiations for a new dispensation." 
"Due to the ANC's radical socialist and racist principles, such 
negotiations are gaining a totally new urgent dimension. What 
is important right now is to stop the ANC on 27 April." 
"Participation must be the password to all. The basis for a 
broad moderate front against the ANC must be established without 
delay. After 27 April it will all be too late."

  [Text] There is nothing new in Lusaka, and the issue on 
police has not yet been overcome. Negotiators, observers, and 
mediators have been observing a pause since yesterday afternoon, 
and the talks will only resume tomorrow. It seems that Chief 
Blondin Beye wants the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] to change its stand. He wants a more 
responsible UNITA to assume a position that meets the highest 
aspirations of the Angolan population. Our correspondent Pedro 
Manuel reports: 
  [Begin Manuel recording] Blondin Beye is still trying to 
approach the two delegations, which until now maintained distant 
positions on the national police issue. It seems that Beye is 
still making efforts to persuade UNITA in particular to review 
its position, which is not supported by anyone. The fact that 
Jonas Savimbi's men remain hardened in their position leads 
analysts in Lusaka to reiterate their view that UNITA may break 
this negotiating round at any time. The talks resume on 17 
January, and the mediators and observers will continue working 
on approaching the negotiating teams to begin discussing 
specific principles. [end recording]

  [Text] In Lusaka, the government and the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are still seeking peace 
for Angola. Another week of activity began in Lusaka today, 
after 12 days that were practically unproductive. The Troika 
officials continue to hold separate meetings with the two 
delegations with a view to bringing them closer on specific 
problems connected with the national police formation. [Word

delegation was back at its hotel. UNITA left the conference 
center at 1300. 
  It is believed that UNITA has held contacts with its 
leadership in Huambo, as was its desire on 14 January, [words 
indistinct] Black Cockerel's negotiators placed on the 
negotiating table a new document of about eight points which 
(?contrast) [words indistinct]. After the introduction of this 
new document by UNITA, observers comment that the government 
delegation will need an opportunity to reply, as will the 
mediators, in order to draft the master document.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks are continuing at a snail's 
pace in Lusaka, the Zambian capital. No consensus has been 
reached yet concerning issues pertaining to the future national 
police force. Lusaka today should see the mediators hold 
separate meetings with the negotiating teams. Pedro Manuel, our 
correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. Yet 
another day opens without consensus on the future national 
police issue, all because there continue to be differences in 
the positions adopted by the two negotiating teams. Today, the 
mediators and observers are expected to continue holding 
separate meetings with the negotiating teams. Since 13 January, 
the negotiators have been seeking an understanding that will 
allow discussions to begin on specific principles and modalities 
governing the future national police force. At their separate 
meetings, the negotiating teams have been delivering to the 
observers their written views on what they believe the aforesaid 
specific principles should be. However, no gap has been bridged 
yet, so UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the 
peace process observers have decided to continue holding 
separate meetings. [end recording]

  [Text] There are very strong historic links between Angola 
and Cuba. The two peoples have been united in very difficult 
and complex circumstances. That was said today by Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina prior to his departure for Harare at 
the end of a two-day working and friendly visit to Angola. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I would like to 
know what Cuba expects from your visit to Angola and other 
African countries? 
  [Robaina in Spanish] Cuba expects from Angola and other 
African countries what we expect from the world. When someone 
thinks that we expect a solution to our problem from Angola, the 
world or any particular country, please, the solution to Cuba's 
problem depends first and foremost on the Cubans themselves and 
a mechanism that it maintains with many in the world. There is 
nothing in particular, least of all Angola in view of the 
difficulties we know it is facing, which holds the solution to 
our problem. The solution to our problem does not lie in those 
quarters only. Cuban expects from Angola and the world what 
Cuba also advocates to the world -- understanding and (?sincere) 
respect. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, would you like to characterize the 
current state of relations between the Cuba and the United 
States, bearing in mind that despite the blockade the United 
States has an interest office in Havana? 
  [Robaina] Well, relations with a country can be 
characterized 
when they are in place. When that is not the case, it is very 
difficult to characterize relations because there are no 
relations between Cuba and the United States. (?Like the United 
States,) Cuba has always stood (?for legal) [words indistinct] 
Cuba is willing to deal with the whole world, including the 
United States, but only on one condition -- absolute respect. 
If there is no absolute respect, we will have nothing to do 
with the United States. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, we have also learned of a certain 
exodus of Cubans to the United States. The latest case to be 
widely reported in the Western media was about the Cuban 
sportsmen who took part in the Central American Games. What 
prompts such an exodus? 
  [Robaina] I think my country is a Third World country. It is 
the same thing that prompts poor countries of the world, the 
difference being that none of them is as famous as Cuba. None 
of those countries (?is as politicized) as Cuba. Cubans have 
the same difficult reasons like other peoples. They have been 
capable of giving in to a degree of pressure and to promises, 
but they are insignificant when compared to the millions of 
people who continually cross the U.S. border, namely Haitians 
[words indistinct] I do not think any of them is as famous as a 
Cuban. It is sufficient to have a Cuban and have scandal, a 
show [preceding word in English]. [end recording]

  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] states that it wants to talk to the government about 
peace, but warns that if the MPLA [Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola] attacks continue, then its men will 
respond the same way. This is the message coming out of a 
communique released today and signed by Jonas Savimbi. 
  The communique again refers to the controversial September 
1992 elections issue, the UNITA leader states he is against the 
judicial instruments and the methods used in the same 
legislative elections. He states that the elections were neither 
fair nor transparent. The number of warnings contained in the 
communique is immense. UNITA states that if the MPLA continues 
to bomb cities, then UNITA will react even more, because the 
government party is corrupt and unable to rule the country 
without weapons.

  [Text] The Angolan Government has already responded to 
Jonas Savimbi's communique. A source of the Angolan Government 
delegation to the Lusaka talks said that they were unaware of 
any air bombardment. According to the source, what happened on 
Wednesday in the geographical area between Pungi and the city of 
Cuito was a clash that originated in a dispute over air-dropped 
food. During the incident, some Angolan Armed Forces and UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] soldiers 
were killed, as well as several civilians.

  [Text] In a communique received at our news desk this 
afternoon, through our correspondent Morais Abel, the military 
command of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] 
in the Cuanza Norte Military Region has reported the presence in 
Cambambe and Dondo of a large number of well-equipped Cuban and 
Katanguese mercenaries. According to the communique, these 
forces, acting jointly with the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola and the riot police, have the mission of 
occupying all areas under control of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuanza Norte, 
particularly the city of Ndalatando, the provincial capital. 
The FALA military command said the mercenaries [words 
indistinct] will not find a room for maneuvers and will be 
repulsed. The military command has warned the international 
community of the danger that this Eduardo dos Santos' adventure 
represents for the Angolan people and the ongoing peace talks in 
Lusaka.

  [Excerpts] Luanda-based sources have reported that the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] is preparing to launch an important military offensive 
on various fronts with the aim of inflicting military defeats on 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. 
Those sources say that the MPLA-PT media have been stepping up 
their propaganda campaign, reporting alleged UNITA attacks on 
all Angolan provinces and suggesting that the Lusaka peace talks 
are about to break down, thereby psychologically preparing the 
Angolan people and the international community for its 
offensive. [passage omitted] 
  Sources in Luanda say that many tonnes of war materiel are 
arriving daily in Luanda Harbor and Luanda Airport. Most of 
that war materiel is highly sophisticated and comes mainly from 
former Eastern Bloc countries, notably the Russian Federation 
which is, ironically, one of the Angolan peace process observers 
attending the Lusaka talks. Other countries supplying war 
materiel to Luanda are Brazil and Spain. Furthermore, Angolan 
reporter Aguiar dos Santos has reported that new consignments of 
sophisticated military equipment are constantly arriving at 
Catumbela Airport. Such equipment includes 6,000 Brazilian-made 
X-40 and X-60 missiles, for which the MPLA-PT recently paid $160 
million. 
  Diplomatic figures in Luanda have said that the secrecy UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has imposed on the 
Lusaka peace talks has been of great assistance to the MPLA-PT's 
propaganda campaign and that the United Nations should demand 
that the MPLA-PT behaves in a manner compatible with the peace 
talks currently under way. [passage omitted] 
  A source in the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA] General Staff told the Voice of the Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel yesterday that the loss of the city of Soyo by 
the MPLA-PT had left that party's ruling class without financial 
mobility and deprived the Defense Ministry of the benefits it 
used to enjoy, ranging from the acquisition of weapons at any 
price to a lack of control over logistics-related spending. 
That FALA General Staff source further noted that, contrary to 
what [Petroleum Minister] Albino Maria Assis had tried to have 
the Angolan people believe, oil exploitation in Soyo has already 
reached 120,000 barrels per day. Albino Assis had said that Soyo 
produced only 40,000 barrels per day. Should Mr. Assis' claims 
prove to be true, then the other 80,000 barrels were being 
diverted to labyrinthine power structures that must still be 
identified, including the Ministry of State Security, Minse, and 
the Directorate of Intelligence and Security of Angola, DISA, 
which used to have a powerful presence in Soyo. 
  That source also disclosed that a daily 40,000 barrels of 
oil 
were taken from the offshore [preceding word in English], while 
80,000 barrels were extracted from land oil fields. 
  Vorgan promises to present evidence concerning the [words 
indistinct].

  [Text] The orthodox communist government of the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] has 
once again signed cooperation accords with the Cuban Government. 
Angolan circles have interpreted the move as a return to the 
days of the Russian-Cuban domination with dangerous consequences 
for Angola and its negotiating process. The cooperation accords 
were signed in Luanda yesterday by Venancio de Moura and Roberto 
Robaina, Fidel Castro's envoy and foreign affairs minister of 
the island of tobacco. Roberto Robaina carried a message from 
Fidel Castro which says Cuba is interested in sending occupation 
troops in exchange for Angolan crude. The National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola will never tolerate this 
because it violates the New York Accord signed by Cuba, South 
Africa, and Namibia. The accord resulted in Namibia's 
independence and the withdrawal of 60,000 Cubans from Angola. 
  Asked to comment on yesterday's accord, a senior Armed 
Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] official said Cuba misses 
the profits it earned through the war it waged in Angola, but it 
should be reminded that the days of empires are over. 
  Yesterday Western diplomats were cited by Johannesburg's 
Channel Africa as fearing the resumption of Angolan-Cuban 
relations could endanger the Lusaka talks. 
  After having failed to recruit mercenaries of various 
nationalities, the Luanda regime has opted for a return of the 
invading Cuban forces which plunged the country into chaos over 
the 16 years of their presence in Angola. There is nothing more 
clear about Eduardo dos Santos' shady deals with Fidel Castro 
than the irony of the Angola-Cuba commercial relations which are 
nothing but military relations. The presence of Cubans in the 
ranks of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] is a fact in Cunene and Huila Provinces. Americo 
Paulino, our correspondent in the region, has the details: 
  Over 10 trucks crossed the Namibian-Angolan border between 
12 
and 13 January 1994, carrying a Cuban contingent. The trucks 
headed to N'Giva. Part of the Cuban contingent will be deployed 
in Huila to beef up FAPLA units (?stationed) along the 
Lubango-Cacula-Quilenges- Caluquembe axis. Other members of the 
Cuban contingent will be sent to Cuvelai to reinforce FAPLA 
units in the Jamba-(Catuca) region to occupy the Kuvango 
District and then head to Huambo. 
  FALA's Operational Command for the independent Cunene region 
has questioned the remarks made by Alioune Blondin Beye, UN 
special representative in Angola, at a news conference. UNITA 
has a lot of respect for Beye who said Mr. Sam Nujoma, chairman 
of the South-West African People's Organization and president of 
the Republic of Namibia, has contributed greatly to the Angolan 
peace process. The question is: How can Namibia contribute to 
peace if that country is used as a springboard for foreign 
(?aggression)? 
  FALA forces are aware of the MPLA-PT's Machievalian 
maneuvers 
to deceive the Angolan and international communities with its 
willingness to negotiate while Cubans enter Angola through 
Namibia.

shot in a clash between two rival military factions outside 
Maseru on Friday, was reportedly still held captive by mutineers 
on Saturday morning, SABC [South African Broadcasting

factions of the Lesotho military was apparently caused by 
dissatisfaction over pay structures. Other reports had it that 
Col Majare was being treated at Maseru's Queen Elizabeth II 
Hospital. The South African Government on Friday offered to 
have Col Majare transferred to a South African hospital for 
treatment.

<F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] Maseru Jan 15 SAPA -- Foreign Minister Pik Botha 
jetted into Maseru on Saturday at the request of the Lesotho 
Government to assist in defusing a potentially explosive 
situation involving rebel soldiers. 
  Disgruntled members of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force were 
still holding hostage the wing commander of the country's Air 
Force, Lt- Col Patrick Majare on Saturday after they shot him 
during an armed confrontation on Friday morning. Wing Commander 
Majare was believed to be under armed guard in a Maseru hospital 
following an operation to an injured shoulder carried out by a 
civilian doctor. 
  The rebel soldiers have ignored pleas from the government to 
release the commander so he can receive further medical 
treatment in Bloemfontein. 
  The situation in the capital of the tiny mountain kingdom 
appeared calm on Saturday, with shops trading and residents 
going about their business as usual. 
  By lunchtime Mr Botha had met senior government and 
opposition figures, including the Prime Minister and Defence 
Minister Dr Ntsu Mokhehle. After lunch he was scheduled to meet 
with all the senior army officers, before trying to bring the 
two factions face-to-face to resolve their differences. 
  The rebel soldiers ostensibly are demanding a doubling of 
their salaries, but South African and Lesotho Government sources 
confirmed to SAPA it appeared the salary issue was a smokescreen 
for political grievances. The real issue is believed to be 
opposition to the ruling Basotholand Congress Party. Lesotho 
and South African Government officials have not ruled out an 
attempted coup. 
  However, the leader of the main opposition party -- the 
Basotho National Party -- on Saturday scoffed at such 
speculation. Mr E R Sekhonyane admitted the situation was 
serious but said the chances of resolving it were good. "I 
don't even want to think of a coup," he told SAPA after a 
meeting with Mr Botha at the home of South Africa's Ambassador 
Gerhard Visser. 
  Mr Botha, speaking after his first round of talks, stressed 
the region could not afford more conflict and disruption. 
Southern Africa would end up being ignored by the First World 
if it didn't get its house in order, he said. 
  Resolution of the issue depended largely on goodwill from 
all 
sides, Mr Botha said. He warned even such a seemingly small 
issue as a pay dispute could blow up into a major problem: 
"Don't even start a small fire. You don't know how much dry 
grass there is around," Mr Botha said. 
  Both Mr Botha and Lesotho Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela 
were at pains to point out Mr Botha's visit was at the request 
of Maseru. "The prospects are good of resolving this thing," 
Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela said. "We've had a coup before, 
and it would be silly if the people of Lesotho were now to have 
another." 
  He pointed out that all the country's political parties had 
issued a joint statement on Friday calling on the disgruntled 
soldiers to lay down their arms. "This little problem can be 
resolved," Mr Qhobela said. 
  Mr Botha is scheduled to fly back to Pretoria around 5PM on 
Saturday.

  [Text] Clashes between factions of the Lesotho armed forces 
have caused concern in the country and in South Africa as well. 
Four helicopters of the Lesotho Army flew into South Africa 
yesterday, and apparently the plan was to escape the skirmish in 
Maseru, and are grounded at Ladybrand. 
  The South African foreign minister, Mr. Pik Botha, arrived 
in 
Lesotho aboard a private jet today to discuss the Lesotho Armed 
forces' fracas with Defense Minister, the Right Honorable Prime 
Minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle; cabinet ministers; commanders of 
the army and the police; as well as the opposition leader, Mr. 
Sekhonyane. 
  In an interview with our reporters Mr. Botha said South 
Africa will never recognize any government taken by force in 
Lesotho. He said he had come to Lesotho to establish the nature 
of the fracas within the Lesotho armed forces, but not to 
dictate terms to the Lesotho Government. Mr. Botha said after 
consultations with the Lesotho authorities he was assured that 
the military problem will be solved peacefully.

  [Excerpts] A day of high drama in the mountain kingdom of 
Lesotho has come to a peaceful end. Clashing factions in the 
Royal Lesotho Defense Force resolved their difference late this 
afternoon. Tension between rival factions in the armed forces 
erupted into an armed confrontation yesterday, and Air Force 
Wing Commander Patrick Majare, was seriously wounded in a 
skirmish. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela recording] There are 
certain political leaders in the kingdom of Lesotho who are 
deliberately instigating certain rebellious elements in the 
Royal Lesotho Defense Force with the hope that if there is a 
mutiny or a clash in the army, the present democratically 
elected government will be overthrown, and they will just walk 
in here. I am not mentioning names, but if the cap fits, they 
can wear it. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Maseru Jan 16 SAPA -- Maseru was calm for a second 
day running on Sunday following Friday's clash between two armed 
factions of the mountain kingdom's defence force. Sporadic 
firing was heard on Saturday night, but according to reports it 
wasn't serious. The shots came from the Makoanyane Military 
Base about 11km outside the capital, home of the faction whose 
demand for a doubling of army salaries led to the clash. 
Residents nearby told SAPA on Sunday it appeared the shots had 
been fired into the air, and there were no reports of injuries. 
  Members of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force's Reccie Unit -- 
the other faction which is believed to be loyal to the 
government -- remained stationed in the mountains on the 
outskirts of Maseru on Sunday. 
  Fears of a possible coup in the tiny enclave were quashed on 
Saturday with the help of South African Foreign Minister Pik 
Botha. He flew in at the request of the Lesotho Government, met 
separately with all the parties involved -- including political 
-- and brokered a truce. However, Mr Botha told his guests 
South Africa would not tolerate a Lesotho Government which came 
to power by force, and vowed to bring it to its knees. 
  Lesotho and South African Government officials confirmed to 
SAPA the pay issue was believed to be a smokescreen for 
political opposition to the ruling Basotholand Congress Party, 
which swept to power in elections last year. 
  Mr Botha also met the leader of the main opposition Basotho 
National Party during his one-day visit.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Suspicions still linger in Lesotho that there were 
political motives behind last week's army mutiny. Ostensibly it 
was all about 100-percent pay rise the soldiers were demanding. 
But there has been talking of rival factions developing with 
some elements of the defense force openly opposed to the 
10-month-old government led by Ntsu Mokhehle. At the weekend 
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha intervened and calm 
appeared to have been restored, but there are still a few 
political rifts to be patched up, as Candy Ramanoene reports in 
this telex from Maseru: 
  The capital Maseru was calm today with shops and businesses 
open as usual. Military presence was less than it has been over 
the past three days, but people are still fearful of further 
shootings. It is still not known what has happened to the 
soldiers involved in the incidents, but it is thought that they 
are under arrest. No statement has, however, come from the 
government. The prime minister, Ntsu Mokhehle, today announced 
that on Wednesday [19 January] they will be having a meeting 
with members of seven political parties to try and work out a 
solution to the crisis, but surprisingly, the two main 
opposition parties, the BNP [Basotho National Party] and the 
royalist Marematlou Freedom Party are unlikely to be at the 
meeting, because they haven't signed, unlike the other seven 
parties, the letter requesting an urgent meeting with the prime 
minister. 
  Political observers here say that popular opinion firmly 
believe that the prime minister should not give into the 
soldiers' demand for 100-percent pay rise. Despite the party's 
denial, the talk on the streets is that BNP was somehow behind 
the weekend's incident.

  [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano has told 
the weekly DOMINGO newspaper that he does not remember having 
discussed with Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo], the alleged involvement of General 
Domingos Fondo in the smuggling of arms. In the interview, 
Chissano said it is possible that he may remember later on 
having had a conversation with Dhlakama on the issue. The 
Mozambican head of state added that there are institutions to 
investigate whether there is a basis in the accusation of the 
Renamo leader. He concluded that once the process begins, 
Dhlakama may give his contribution.

  [Text] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN 
secretary general in Mozambique, has said in Maputo that 
demobilized troops from the government and the Mozambique 
National Resistance could receive salaries for 18 to 24 months. 
Aldo Ajello is quoted by DOMINGO weekly as having said that the 
payment of salaries for 18 to 24 months will depend on the 
extent of the international community's contribution toward the 
peace process. The issue was raised last month at the meeting 
the Mozambican Government with the Paris Consultative Group, 
made up of the World Bank and donors.

  [Text] Windhoek Jan 17 SAPA -- Namibia's ruling SWAPO 
[South-West African People's Organization] party has thrown its 
weight behind the African National Congress [ANC] with a 
week-long national campaign to raise election funds and support 
for its old ally. The show of solidarity was to have begun with 
a rally addressed by ANC President Nelson Mandela and Namibian 
President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on January 27, but Mr Mandela 
cancelled his visit. ANC spokesman Gill Marcus said the ANC 
President had other engagements. 
  SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said senior ANC and 
SWAPO officials would address meetings and rallies across 
Namibia to raise money for the ANC's election coffers. He said 
SWAPO's support for the ANC was part of the responsibility it 
felt towards South Africa. SWAPO was confident of, and hoped for 
an ANC landslide victory and felt a need to contribute in the 
same way the ANC had helped SWAPO to victory in the 1989 
Namibian elections. 
  Mr Garoeb said SWAPO believed the ANC, with its "pragmatic 
and experienced leadership", was the party best structured to 
manage a post-election South Africa and keep southern Africa 
stable. 
  Money would be raised at SWAPO branch and regional level in 
cooperation with the National Union of Namibian Workers. Mr 
Garoeb appealed to all South Africans living in Namibia to 
register and vote for the ANC on April 27. 
  In an editorial on Monday, the Windhoek Advertiser warned 
that SWAPO's support for the ANC risked drawing Namibia into a 
partisan role in a potential future civil war. "In the event of 
a troubled South Africa plunging into civil strife of 
proportions where factions go over to guerrilla war and 
unrestricted sabotage, Namibia will not be spared. Our 
allegiance with the ANC will under such circumstances be on the 
debit side of Namibia's interests," wrote editor Hannes Smith. 
  Mr Garoeb dismissed Mr Smith's comment as the "cry-baby 
attitude and professional negativism from a confirmed pessimist" 
who could not see anything good about the SWAPO government.

the United States' trade embargo and the loss of its Eastern 
European allies. Speaking in Zimbabwe, Mr. Robaina said Cuba was 
looking for markets for its raw materials, and for new supplies 
of oil to replace imports from the former Soviet Union. The 
Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Harare from the Angolan 
capital, Luanda, denied reports that Cuba planned to negotiate 
the supply of arms to Angola.

  [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has pardoned and 
freed two officials who shot and nearly killed an opposition 
politician during the fiercely contested general election. 
  Mr. Mugabe ordered the release of an official in the secret 
Central Intelligence Organization, (Elias Khenagoni), and the 
provincial youth leader of the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe 
African National Union Patriotic Front] party, (Khezito 
Tshibambu). The two were last year sentenced to seven years in 
prison for shooting (Patrick Khumbayi), who was contesting a 
parliamentary seat against the vice-president Simon Muzenda in 
the 1990 election. They were pardoned hours after their appeal 
against their conviction was thrown out by the country's supreme 
court.

  [Text] There has been a sharp criticism in Zimbabwe over 
President Mugabe's decision to pardon two men convicted of 
shooting a prominent opposition leader Patrick Kumbai in 1985. 
The pardon was granted shortly after the supreme court 
dismissed an appeal by the two men, one of whom was a senior 
intelligence officer. Zimbabwe's leading human rights 
organization said the pardon suggested that the shooting in 
which Mr. Kumbai was badly wounded had been authorized at a high 
level. It said there would also be grave implications for the 
relationship between the government and judiciary. Mr. Mugabe 
has not explained his decision.

  [Text] Harare Jan 18 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's Industry and 
Commerce Minister Chris Ushewokunze, 49, died in a car accident 
on Monday night, police said. Mr Ushewokunze was killed 
instantly in a head-on collision with an army vehicle at about 
8PM near the town of Chegutu, 110km west of Harare. 
  Another unidentified person was killed in the accident and 
eight were injured, police said. Mr Ushewokunze was regarded as 
the leader of a group of young, educated ministers being groomed 
by President Robert Mugabe to succeed the older guard in the 
ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic 
Front]) Party, veterans of the campaign against white minority 
rule. 
  Observers say Mr Ushewokunze, who was related to Mr Mugabe, 
was a likely successor to ailing Finance Minister Bernard 
Chidzero. A lawyer who trained at the University of Rhodesia, 
Edinburgh University in Scotland and at London University, Mr 
Ushewokunze served [words indistinct] black Zimbabwean cabinet 
minister to visit South Africa on official business, flying to 
Cape Town last February to meet South African Finance Minister 
Derek Keys to discuss renewing the trade pact between the two 
countries. 
  Mr Ushewokunze leaves his wife, Juliet, and four children.

  [Text] In the Central African Republic, President 
Ange-Felix Patasse has spoken for the first time since the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, a few days ago, that is to say, 
last Tuesday evening [11 January]. He said that he had accepted 
and signed the devaluation measure for the sake of maintaining a 
consensus with the other CFA heads of state. In a televised 
address yesterday evening, the President of the Central African 
Republic announced follow-up measures to the devaluation and, as 
you will hear, also issued a stern warning to would-be 
speculators: 
  [Begin Patasse recording] This adjustment cannot be regarded 
as a catastrophe if we can manage our economy properly. 
However, it is obvious that I will not tolerate destabilizing 
actions by speculators. Likewise, I hereby give warning to 
anyone who may be tempted to raise the prices of their 
merchandise, for their trading permits will be immediately 
withdrawn. I also give warning to the troublemakers, to those 
who take advantage of the slightest occurrence to sow disorder 
without concern for the future of our country. [end recording]

  [Text] The Angolan Government has offered 16 percent of 
police posts to the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA], but the latter feels it is too little and wants 
40 percent. A source monitoring the Lusaka talks told the 
Portuguese news agency, LUSA, that UNITA has questioned the 
government's failure to specifically state what posts will be 
filled by UNITA members. UNITA wants to know how many generals, 
captains, and agents will form part of the police, and what 
percentage of each of those posts will be accorded to the 
organization.

  [Text] Maseru Jan 15 SAPA -- Fears of a possible coup in 
Lesotho by rebel soldiers were quashed on Saturday with the help 
of South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha. However, Mr Botha 
warned at the end of a one day visit to the tiny mountain 
kingdom South Africa would not recognise any Lesotho government 
which came to power by force. Pretoria would bring such a 
government to its knees, he told a press conference before 
jetting out. "We will make it impossible for such a government 
to survive," he said. "We will close the border." Mr Botha was 
confident a new South African Government would also not 
recognise a Lesotho Government which came to power by a coup. 
  He was leaving the enclave confident, however, that the 
critical situation had been defused. He had received a 
commitment from the two opposing defence force factions which 
clashed on Friday that they would negotiate a truce. 
  The cause of the clash supposedly was a demand by the rebel 
group for a doubling of army salaries. But Lesotho and SA 
[South African] Government officials told SAPA on Saturday it 
appeared the dissidents had political grievances, and were 
preparing for a possible coup. 
  The ruling Basotholand Congress Party swept to power in 
March 
last year, ousting [words indistinct] on on Friday, but said the 
pilots and their aircraft were being looked for. They are 
expected to return soon to Lesotho. SAPA was informed four 
helicopters landed in Ladybrand across the border in the Orange 
Free State. The reason for the pilots' [words indistinct] that 
their commander, Lt-Col Patrick Matare [name as received], was 
injured in Friday's clash and they feared the rebel soldiers 
were after them too. 
  Mr Botha said he had been assured Col Matare was in a 
satisfactory condition in hospital in the capital, and there was 
no need to accept a SA Government offer to have him treated in 
Bloemfontein. The commander, who was still being held hostage 
by the rebels on Saturday afternoon, was reportedly shot in the 
shoulder. A civilian doctor operated on him. 
  Mr Botha first met separately with all the parties involved, 
including the two army factions, before bringing them together 
face- to-face. 
  The minister and his hosts were at pains to point out he had 
been invited to Lesotho to assist and was not "barging in". "I 
did not come here to preach," he said, pointing out South Africa 
had its own problems with violence. He said his basic message 
to the parties was the region could ill-afford more 
confrontation if it wanted to attract foreign investment. Any 
problems in Lesotho could also affect the highlands water 
project. 
  He had also pointed out the Lesotho Government, like South 
Africa's, did not have the money to increase salaries 
willy-nilly. 
  "The future of Africa and the world will depend very heavily 
on economic development," Mr Botha said. He added he had urged 
the soldiers to tackle the "real enemy" -- the social upliftment 
of Lesotho's people.

<F P=106> [Question and answer session following a news conference by </F>
Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan with local reporters in 
Abidjan on 14 January] 
  [Excerpts] [Noel Yao, REVEIL HEBDO] France has announced 
the cancellation of half of our debt. How does this measure 
reflect on the lives of Ivorians in concrete terms? 
  [Duncan] There are two levels of response to your question. 
First, when you owe, normally you must settle your debt. This 
debt will inevitably weigh on the use of your resources. 
However, since you have less to pay, you have fewer constraints 
on your resources, so you can use part of your resources to make 
new investments and even meet your everyday needs. This is the 
first aspect of my answer. In a more concrete way, this 
reduction of our debt will mean the cancellation of all the 
arrears Cote d'Ivoire owes to the French Development Fund, CFD. 
This is extremely important, because up until now we were not 
able to draw from this fund for the simple reason that we had 
not paid our arrears. We are now in a position to get 
disbursements from previous assistance. 
  For example, the CFD used to give assistance to the Abidjan 
transport company [SOTRA] with government support. In recent 
times the disbursements were stopped because Cote d'Ivoire had 
accumulated arrears. Very soon we will be able to get a 
disbursement of about 4 billion francs. You are undoubtedly 
aware that SOTRA has some problems; there are not enough buses. 
The government had to resort to additional borrowing of about 
90 billion francs to have 150 buses repaired. New buses are 
needed, and now we have funds. This is one concrete element. 
  Another concrete result of this reduction of our debt on the 
lives of Ivorians will be in the textile sector. As you know, 
we reorganized the textile sector, which took us a lot of time. 
Long discussions took place between the government and the 
private sector for the partial privatization of the sector. The 
reorganization was to lead to the abolition of 800 out of 6,000 
jobs. It was envisaged that after the sector had been revived 
reemployment would be conducted. All this necessitated about 11 
billion francs from the CFD. The greater part of this amount 
has already been disbursed, and about 3.6 billion francs remain. 
Because of the state's arrears to the CFD, the remaining 
disbursement could not be made, so the reorganization program 
encountered problems. The situation was even more alarming 
because out of the remaining money 500 million francs was needed 
to resettle the laid off workers. [passage omitted] 
  [Yao] Let's talk a bit about the sovereignty of our 
countries. One has the feeling that the devaluation was imposed 
on our heads of state without their being able to resist. Did 
this decision come from our leaders, or it was simply dictated 
to them by our partners? 
  [Duncan] I am going to put things bluntly: The decision to 
change the exchange rate of the CFA franc was made by the heads 
of state and governments of the 14 African countries. If the 
heads of state did not want devaluation, they said so. Don't 
you remember the in July 1992 in Paris they said no to 
devaluation? Are you saying that when they say no, it is their 
own decision, but when they say yes, then it is no longer their 
decision? We must be logical. One can say "no" at a given time 
and say "yes" at another time if new elements allow for a change 
of opinion. [passage omitted] 
  Among the international institutions, financial backers 
demanded conditionalities because they wanted to ensure that 
countries that come to them have the ability to repay their 
loans and have a good economic future, because it is economic 
situation of a country which enables it to generate resources to 
pay its external debt. [passage omitted] 
  Let us get this straight: The decision is not an imposed 
one. We opted for devaluation because it appeared to us to be 
the only way out of our crisis. 
  [Freedom Neruda, LA VOIE] Salaries have been frozen for 10 
years now. It is obvious that the 5 to 10 percent salary 
increase is not enough. In Niger labor unionists have demanded 
a 70-percent salary increase. What does the government intend 
to do in order to have the crop purchase prices it has just set 
respected? Last year farmers were not protected enough against 
dubious purchasers. 
  [Duncan] We admit that the 5 to 15 percent salary increase 
is not enough. You said that Niger workers have demanded 70 
percent, but how much did they obtain? This is what you should 
know first. The reality is willy-nilly. We announced soon after 
we returned from Washington that we would call on the nation for 
more efforts, and this was not a lie. It is obvious that if you 
increase salaries by 70 percent and producer prices by 100 
percent your devaluation will be to no avail. It is like 
beating the air. Let us understand each other well: Salary 
increases should be low, otherwise your devaluation is to no 
avail, which means that there is no effect, and you should start 
all anew. One cannot do that. These are measures taken once 
for all. 
  Why is the increase in farmers' revenues more substantial? 
This is because they bore the brunt of the adjustment for a 
long time. You, wage earners, your salaries were frozen but not 
reduced. Elsewhere, salaries were cut, in addition to the 
devaluation. You cannot say that you were not defended enough. 
  It is therefore important for political parties and labor 
unions to understand that salaries cannot be increased beyond a 
given level, otherwise the operation become worthless. 
  Concerning the control of crop purchasing prices, we have 
set 
up an interministerial committee charged with monitoring the 
implementation of the various measures that we have just 
announced. Even before the devalution, the minister of 
agriculture took measures to this effect. They must now be 
reinforced and checked. 
  In this sector and others, particular punitive measures will 
be taken against businessmen who do not respect the decisions 
made. In the past it was decided that farmers should 
participate in the commercialization of their produce. The 
guaranty funds will be increased substantially. 
Cooperative-oriented groups will therefore be given resources 
to play their role. 
  [James Cenac, NOUVEL HORIZON] Mr. Prime Minister, gas 
delivered by the Ivorian Refinery Company costs 48 CFA francs. 
The state gets 243 CFA francs for this gas, while pump 
retailers get nine CFA francs on it. Now that sacrifices are 
needed, isn't it possible for the state to use its margin to 
freeze the price of gas sold at filling stations, especially 
since the price of the commidity is linked to the dollar, which 
has depreciated over the past few days, and as there is a 
subsidy system in the price structure? 
  [Ducan] These are legitimate concerns which were much 
expected. You can imagine that these issues were examined, 
reexamined, and reviewed by the experts and the heads of state 
and government who made this decision. [passage omitted] 
  First, concerning gas, this is a major question. I can see 
that our friend James Cenac, went through enough documents to 
give figures. Except for some minor details, his figures are 
reliable. The answer is relatively simple. For a country to be 
developed, it must benefit from projects, and to finance them, 
it needs money. Where does this money come from -- from 
taxpayers. Until further notice and before other types of 
measures are taken, this money will be taken from taxpayers. 
Actually, one of the means used to finance projects in Cote 
d'Ivoire is taxes on petroleum products, since a large part of 
these taxes go to the special investment and equipment budget to 
finance roads and the major projects in this country. This 
country's infrastructure was actually financed by these taxes. I 
worked in the Ministry of Finance, so I also have some figures. 
These taxes considerably contributed to financing projects in 
this country, particularly in the road sector. Of course, fewer 
taxes could have been raised by petroleum products. 
  [Duncan] If this had been done, however, we would probably 
have not attained the development level we have today. That is 
the reality of it. Oil taxes -- and I will give you the figures 
-- amounted at the time to between 80 and 100 billion CFA francs 
per year. They were substantial gains indeed, and that is what 
enabled the state to carry out investments.... That is what 
enabled the Special Investment and Equipment Budget [BSIE] to be 
maintained at a relatively acceptable level in order to carry 
out normal maintenance, pay for recurrent expenditure, and make 
new investments despite the economic crisis. That is where the 
funds for all that came from. If you do not have that 
information, and I know you do, but since you asked the question 
for the benefit of the public, I would like you to know that 
these taxes were used to finance investments in our country. 
  You are saying that we could have reduced taxes to lessen 
the 
burden on the population. When studies were conducted at the 
beginning, partners for development suggested a 35-percent price 
increase for fuel. You are always complaining that decisions 
made with the IMF, banks, and development partners take a long 
time, so we are incompetent. We could have agreed to a 
35-percent or even a 40-percent price increase. What would your 
reaction have been if that had been the case? [passage omitted] 
  The customs duty in Cote d'Ivoire is very high. It was 
increased as time went on to enable the state to earn revenue. 
It developed into a prohibitive customs duty and encouraged 
fraud. You are aware that for a few years now we have been 
trying to reduce customs duties. This has cost us a lot of 
money, but we are on the right track because the basic customs 
duties have been brought down to acceptable levels of around 35 
percent. [passage omitted] 
  [Lebry, FRATERNITE MATIN] Mr. Prime Minister, I would like 
to ask you questions which are political and economic at the 
same time, since devaluation involves both aspects. The first 
question is this: You mentioned that representatives of the 
countries were truly unanimous in their decision during the 
summit. However, certain people expressed anxiety here and 
there, which seems to show that there was no true unanimity 
after all. What assurances do heads of state and prime 
ministers have that France will not abandon African countries? 
What assurances have African countries obtained or what 
promises have they received to confirm that this will not happen 
because they run the risk of being left in the lurch by France? 
  The second question is: At the moment, France is continuing 
to guarantee the CFA franc's convertibility. I would like you 
to return to that issue. In the long run, in light of France's 
wish to get a firm footing in Europe and in light of the 
weakness of African economies, and especially with pressure from 
Americans, a situation may arise in which France may pull away 
from backing the CFA franc. How do leaders of African countries 
intend to prepare African economies for such an eventuality? 
  [Duncan] As to whether the decision was unanimous, I can 
confirm that it was indeed unanimous. I am not the one making 
it up; you heard the communique. It was signed by all the heads 
of state and prime ministers who were in Dakar. That is what I 
am using as my reference. We insisted on everybody signing it. 
I have signed copies of the communique, which are proof of the 
fact that the decision was unanimous. France delivered a very 
strong message at the summit, and I think everybody heard what 
Minister Roussin said there as well as what he later said on 
his return to France. The message was: It is not just the 
presidency, it is not just the French Government, it is France 
which is backing African countries of the franc zone in this 
operation. It is not backing them just politically, it is 
backing them economically and financially. The measures which 
have been announced are along those lines. I have already 
mentioned debt reduction, and I will give you the figures soon. 
There will also be financial assistance for development. The 
French fund has received instructions on that, and the Finance 
Ministry has begun contacts to determine how France is going to 
assist Cote d'Ivoire in carrying out investment. 
  This is not just empty talk; it is a political decision 
which 
has economic and financial repercussions. France has already 
assisted certain countries whose situation was particularly 
urgent with the payment of salaries. That decision was made 
right away. This goes to show that France is truly committed to 
assisting our countries. [passage omitted] Despite this 
commitment, before anything else, we must be responsible. In 
the first place, the future must depend on us and not on France. 
We must know this. We must first help ourselves, and France 
will help us later. 
  Concerning the issue of the guarantee for and the 
convertibility of the CFA franc, I probably have to explain it 
further for better understanding. At the time of independence, 
the desire to create our national currencies was expressed in 
our countries. Since self-determination is regarded as one of 
the most significant signs of sovereignty, it was suggested that 
it was necessary to create our own currency and manage it all 
alone. The issue was raised at the level of the former French 
West Africa and the former French Equatorial Africa. Here, the 
states felt that it was better to remain in a monetary union. 
This led to the creation of the monetary union for the West 
African and the Central African zones. Together these states 
created their currency, the CFA franc, the management of which 
could have been made independently, because we were six or seven 
countries that came together. This means not being connected to 
any external currency. It is a political choice that we could 
have made. [passage omitted] 
  Things went well from 1962 until 1980. [passage omitted] 
The crisis began in 1980, and the accounts which had surpluses 
began to diminish until they became negative. We had a surplus 
of between 100 and 200 billion. We later came to a deficit of 
10, 20, 30, 100, and even 200 billion CFA francs at a certain 
time. The guarantee played a role in this case and the balance 
became positive again -- even if not very significantly -- at 
least by between 50 and 60 billion CFA francs in our zone. This 
was not quite sufficient, because it was necessary to go beyond 
the threshold of 20 percent. You see, assurance is a guarantee. 
Nobody is obliged to take to it, but at that time, you would be 
running a personal risk. 
  We feel that at any given time, one can successfully run 
such 
a risk when one's economy is well seated and diversified. This 
is the future you are talking about. 
  For what reason should we be attached to the European 
currency unit [ECU]? Look at the level of our trade with 
Europe. According to the statistics, we have between 60 to 70 
percent trade with EEC countries. Why should we want to get 
attached to the ECU, which will be Europe's sole currency? 
Simply because, if we do so, we will become attached to the 
totality of the external partners. We can eventually do this 
without even asking for a guarantee from France. France can 
propose it, but what will this cost us? Will this help us? 
  Let us build the future for our children. Let us not make 
then run useless risks by seeking to create another currency 
apart from the CFA franc. We need to be prudent in politics. 
We need to have guarantees and envisage all the possibilities. 
We are not less free than those countries which have their own 
currencies. We speak with the same voice in international 
meetings and we are even better respected when we speak. Look 
at the delegations which were coming to Cote d'Ivoire when the 
late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny was receiving people here. 
You will also see the number of heads of state and government 
who will come here during his funeral. We need to avoid too 
much susceptibility in politics. The economy must predominate. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Roger Kouassi, FRATERNITE MATIN] Are we safe from further 
devaluation? With the devaluation, has the specter of 
retrenchment in the civil service been avoided forever? When 
prices are not displayed, can we really prevent abusive price 
increases? 
  [Duncan] You are right. It could happen that there is 
further devaluation. Unfortunately, this is what happens to the 
national currencies of most African countries. This happens 
when the rates of devaluation do not correspond with the 
imbalance. If we had set a rate of 25 percent, there probably 
would have been another devaluation a year later. 
  This is what surprised everybody, especially traders, who 
were expecting the devaluation but not at 50 percent. Provided 
that we are able to adopt the measures that I have mentioned 
concerning the control on the social demands (salaries) and 
provided that that we are able to respect the price increases, I 
am sure that we will succeed. 
  The total subsidy granted to help maintain prices at the 
level they are now has reached 30 billion CFA francs. I say 
that there will not be any subsequent devaluations. Concerning 
retrenchment in the civil service, because of the devaluation, 
there will not be any retrenchment. I only spoke about 
voluntary retirement. 
  If some people want to go on voluntary retirement from the 
civil service, we will help them do so by paying them 18 months' 
salary at the time of their departure. This is better than what 
has been achieved so far. 
  Concerning the listing of prices, the minister of commerce 
and industry spoke on the subject in order to avoid panic. He 
was to have hosted a news conference on 13 January, but I asked 
him to wait for mine first. Beginning next week the various 
ministers can hold theirs. I asked that the public 
sector-private sector liaison group be activated so that these 
issues could be discussed. 
  A commission will be set up on the issue of devaluation and 
hold consultations that could lead to practical solutions. 
  It is also worth noting that some time ago a decision was 
made on the liberalization of prices, except for the prices of a 
certain number of regulated products. This explains that there 
was no price control because an important section has been 
liberalized in order to encourage competition. In the decisions 
reached, the authorized products which will be subjected to 
special control were indicated. 
  The practical measures will be announced when the meeting 
takes place. Among other things, there will be measures 
indicating to the consumer the places and the telephone numbers 
where one can lodge complaints. These measures will be taken 
beginning next week, because the consumer is the real 
controller. We cannot put policemen in all the shops, but the 
consumer who notices any irregularity will be able to contact 
the ones who will be able to remedy the problem. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Gustave Nguessan, REVEIL HEBDO] Couldn't the search for 
competitiveness in Cote d'Ivoire because of the devaluation be 
hindered by competitive devaluation that could be introduced by 
neighboring Anglophone countries (Ghana and Nigeria)? 
  [Duncan] Due to the rate of devaluation, it is certain that 
we will be more competitive than these countries. Could there 
be a threat of a competitive devaluation? Let me remind you 
that the change in parity is managed by an international 
organization, namely the IMF, of which we are all members. The 
change in parity obeys some precise rules. The countries to 
which you refer are compelled to abide by these rules. The IMF 
will always have its say, which will help prevent competitive 
devaluations. 
  [Raymond Djadou, Bank Workers' Trade Union] I am Raymond 
Djadou, secretary general of the Bank and Financial Institutions 
Workers' Union of Cote d'Ivoire. Mr. Prime Minister, you 
mentioned an increase in salary in the public sector. Is the 
private sector concerned by this measure? 
  [Duncan] The workers' minimum salary and the agricultural 
workers' minimum salary are a guideline, but it is also true 
this is not the objective, because the private sector is 
regulated by collective agreements. The case in point here is 
that the state gives directives and will later initiate 
discussions. On the other hand, the Employers' Association and 
others expressed the wish to meet us, so decisions will be made. 
  [Patrice Douh, IVOIR'SOIR] I would like to ask a two-fold 
question. On 19 and 20 April 1993, a seminar was held in 
Abidjan on the harmonization of corporate law in franc zone 
countries. While African states were studying reports that were 
submitted to them, the decision to devaluate the CFA franc fell 
on their heads like a sword. Won't this hasty decision to 
devaluate the CFA franc be a source of blockage at the exchange 
level between West African countries? 
  My second question is to know the level, in terms of 
quantity, of the exchange volume in the West AFrican zone and in 
which proportion, taking into account the devaluation, exports 
will increase in this zone? 
  [Duncan] You just said that there was an April meeting in 
Abidjan on corporate law and that there has been a certain lack 
of preparedness in terms of devaluation that could jeopardize 
cooperation. First, I would like to say that there was no lack 
of preparedness. Just because governments did not talk about 
the devaluation in the streets does not mean that they did not 
study the question. I can assure you that no politician 
announces devaluation beforehand. I do not know of a single one 
who would do this. It is an operation that is carried out under 
the cover of night and generally while markets are closed and on 
weekends; then it is over. Therefore, there is no need to shout 
that we are going to devaluate. This operation was well planned 
and thoroughly examined before a decision was made. I will tell 
you that this decision will strengthen cooperation within the 
zone and the cooperation with France. All commitments made here 
in Abidjan as related to the cooperation between African 
countries will continue as far as rights are concerned at the 
social security level and corporate law. You will see that all 
these documents will be swiftly examined and signed in the 
shortest possible time. [passage omitted] 
  [Goore-Bi-Hue, FRATERNITE MATIN] Mr. Prime Minister, you 
stated that devaluation will make households consume 
Ivorian-made goods. What measures will you take to ensure that 
households effectively consume quality goods, to ensure, for 
example, that locally manufactured rubber shoes last much longer 
and that Ivorian-made cloth does not rip after washing for a 
second or third time? 
  [Duncan] You are right in pointing this out. I think this 
must be the concern of all Ivorian industrialists. They should 
ensure that their goods are of good quality. The Ministry of 
Industry and Commerce, in cooperation with the private sector, 
has established the Ivorian Standards Board to ensure that goods 
manufactured in Cote d'Ivoire meet Ivorian standards. We must 
ensure that the goods leaving this country meet international 
standards as far as quality is concerned. I think competition, 
which is now more open, will make buyers reject goods that are 
of low quality. As I told you, once this measure is taken, more 
industrialists will come back to Cote d'Ivoire.... 
  [Ballo Lancine, Radio Cote d'Ivoire] Mr. Prime Minister, you 
spoke about 650 billion CFA francs that will be disbursed. Who 
will disburse this amount --the IMF, the World Bank, France? Is 
this another burden that is coming to put more weight upon the 
external debt? 
  [Duncan] The 650 billion CFA francs will mainly come from 
the IMF, of course. This money will come from major 
contributors, from development partners, from Japan, and so on. 
Some of them have already announced their commitment. You are 
asking whether this is going to put more weight on the Ivorian 
debt. Of course, these are elements of debts. What I can tell 
you at this stage is that these elements are at very 
consessional rates. As a result of this operation, Cote 
d'Ivoire becomes an International Development Association member 
country, that is, a country that can benefit from assistance at 
concessional rates from the World Bank. Thus, we can now 
receive more loans at extremely low rates like 0.5 percent 
repayable over lengthy periods, say 40 years. That is it. We 
will thus have the means for development. 
  As this is the last question, I would like to conclude this 
news conference by saying that we have made difficult decisions. 
This is a new start. This is a term used by a number of heads 
of state who spoke at the Dakar meeting. The statement issued 
by the president of the Republic pointed this out. Cote 
d'Ivoire and all its components -- farmers, civil servants, the 
business community, housewives -- must all feel involved in this 
decision. They should not see only its negative aspects, but 
rather the positive aspects that will enable Cote d'Ivoire to 
get out of the present rut in the near future. In summation, we 
are saying that Cote d'Ivoire must improve its competitiveness. 
Public finances must be improved, giving more means to the 
state. The possibility of developing businesses in Cote 
d'Ivoire must be improved, both at the level of national 
businessmen as well as foreign businessmen. The return of 
private capital that might have been placed abroad, if such does 
exist, will be made easier. It is essential that Cote d'Ivoire 
play its important card. We have some assets and we must 
ensure that they are well exploited. I have been asked in 
particular to tell you that the government and the president of 
the Republic are confident in the future, and that the president 
of the Republic and the government will work tirelessly so that 
we regain our growth rate within a reasonable period. This 
growth rate must reach and later exceed the 3.5 percent 
population growth rate. We must reach a 5.6 percent growth rate 
every month. We can achieve that within the coming two or three 
years. This is a message of hope. I think that Cote d'Ivoire 
has the human and material potential to attain this goal. Thank 
you.

<F P=106> [Report on statement to parliament by the Finance Ministry </F>
on the 1994 budget -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The government has decided to raise the tax-free 
concession from 150,000 to 210,000 cedis per annum. The tax 
rate applicable to other lower income earners has also been 
reduced. This is to prevent individuals in the lower income 
group from being liable to higher taxes in view of the recent 
increase in the minimum wage. This was contained in this year's 
budget proposal presented to parliament today by the minister of 
finance, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey. 
  Other tax rates on personal incomes are as follows: From 
291,000 to 392,850 cedis will attract 5 percent; and 431,000 to 
573,300 cedis, 10 percent. On indirect taxes and import duties 
on all goods which are imported under exemption and 
concessionary rates, will now attract a rate of 10 percent, 
while those classified as standard and luxury will now attract 
25 percent. [sentence as heard] 
  In the case of sales tax, imports, the rates of goods 
classified as concessionary and standard have been reduced to 15 
percent while those for luxury goods remain at 35 percent. 
Building materials will now attract a concessionary rate of 10 
percent import duty. Dr. Botchwey explained that this has become 
necessary in view of the gross abuse of the decision to remove 
all customs and import duties on certain building materials. 
  On the question of Ghana Investment Center concessions, the 
government is of the view that the exemptions of saloon cars, 
office equipment, and consumables are excessive and unnecessary 
for the effective promotion of investment in the country. In 
this regard, granting of these exemptions will be thoroughly 
reviewed. 
  Dr. Botchwey said the government has also responded to the 
complaints of manufacturers by looking more closely at the 
structure of existing tariffs with a view to ensuring that there 
is no unintended but inherent discrimination against domestic 
producers. Therefore, finished imported commodities will in 
future not attract less taxes than the amount payable on their 
domestically produced equivalent merely by underdeclaration of 
value of the competing imports. 
  On petroleum duties, Dr. Botchwey said an amount of 216.8 
billion cedis has been projected as petroleum tax this year. 
And to obtain this revenue, it is proposed that petroleum 
prices be increased by an average of 18 percent and remove the 
subsidy on premix. The increase in the price of kerosene will 
be 10 percent. 
  Dr. Botchwey explained that in view of the dramatic changes 
in the subregion, especially the devaluation of the CFA [franc] 
and the policy changes in Nigeria, it would not be in the 
national interest to keep prices at the 1993 levels. He said 
for some time now, many importers have been buying all kinds of 
goods including secondhand or used goods into the country under 
the trade liberalization scheme. Some of these have proved to 
be harmful to the health of the users. Accordingly, he proposed 
the banning of secondhand goods such as undergarments, towels, 
socks, handkerchiefs, bedsheets, pillowcases, mattresses, and 
sanitary wear. 
  On general economic targets, Dr. Botchwey said real GDP 
[gross domestic product] is expected to grow by 5 percent and 
end of period inflation rate, 15 percent. An overall balance of 
payment surplus of $180 million is to be achieved. A budget 
surplus of 68 billion cedis is also expected. 
  He said to achieve these targets and create the foundation 
for accelerated growth, it will be necessary to raise the 
investment-GDP ratio to at least 15 percent this year from 12.9 
percent in 1992. This, he said, is to be financed by increases 
in domestic savings. 
  Consequently, the government's role in savings mobilization 
effort will be crucial, as it would be expected to reverse the 
huge fiscal deficits generated over the last two years into a 
substantial surplus to be channeled into productive investment 
in both the private and public sectors of the economy. 
  Dr. Botchwey said the 1994 budget provides for total 
appropriation of about 1,000 billion cedis, while total revenues 
including grants are projected at 1,078 billion cedis, 
(?implying) a surplus of 68 billion cedis. [as heard] He said 
to achieve this target, there is the need for further 
streamlining of the tax system, improvement in the efficiency of 
tax administration, reform of the tax structure, as well as the 
elimination of the lapses in tax administration. 
  With regard to expenditures, he said they have been 
programmed to support income-generating activities and poverty 
alleviation through income redistribution. 
  Total expenditures have been projected to rise from a 
provisional outturn in 1993, from 782.9 billion cedis to 1,000 
billion -- a rise of 29 percent. Recurrent expenditures will 
amount to 742.4 billion cedis compared to 596.6 billion in 1992. 
Expenditure on personal emoluments is to rise to 274.5 billion 
cedis from 227.6 billion. 
  Negotiations are to be conducted with the Civil Servants 
Association within the framework of the civil service machinery 
to determine the appropriate parameters for income policy for 
the year. 
  Outlays for repairs, maintenance, and renewals are projected 
to rise by 27.7 percent to 114.4 billion as against a 
provisional outturn of 91.1 billion cedis last year. 
  Dr. Botchwey said education and health sectors are to have 
larger allocations to enable them to improve upon their 
services. The education sector will be expected to provide more 
textbooks and other accessories, while the health sector will 
concentrate on an accelerated rehabilitation of health 
facilities as well as the provision of adequate drugs and 
dressings. 
  He said the allocation for subvented organizations has been 
projected to rise to 95.1 billion from 75 billion in 1992 -- an 
increase of 26.8 percent. Also, transfers in respect of 
pensions, gratuities, and social security contributions are 
estimated at 79.7 billion compared to 64.8 billion in 1993 -- a 
rise of 22.9 percent. 
  Dr. Botchwey said interest on domestic debt is expected to 
rise from 91.9 billion cedis in 1993 to 114.2 billion in 1994. 
This increase, he said, is due to the large bank and nonbank 
borrowing to finance the deficit in 1993. Interest on external 
debt is to rise from 43.9 billion in 1993 to 61.3 billion in 
1994. Dr. Botchwey explained that the increase is mainly due to 
expected exchange rate depreciation.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has registered a 
strong protest to the Togolese charge d'affaires in Ghana 
against the reported abduction by Togolese naval officers of 
seven Ghanaian fishermen who were on a fishing expedition at 
Aflaho, in Ghana's territorial waters. An official statement 
issued in Accra by the ministry said Ghana is demanding the 
immediate release of the fishermen and warned that it will hold 
the Togolese Government responsible for the safety of the 
abducted fishermen. 
  The ministry has, at the same time, requested Ghana's charge 
d'affaires in Togo to pursue the matter vigorously with the 
Togolese authorities and report back urgently.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Guinea Government has been perhaps surprisingly 
silent about the recent events of Macenta near the Liberia 
border. It is now clear that ULIMO [United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia] forces crossed the border from Liberia 
and caused havoc in carnage in the Macenta region leaving, 
according to one estimate, 100 people dead. They were 
apparently carrying out reprisals against people backing the 
anti-ULIMO Loma Defense Force. Yesterday Liberia's interim 
president, Amos Sawyer, apologized for the ULIMO incursion and 
today the Guinea authorities have responded. From Conakry, Fode 
Fofana telexed this report: 
  The Guinean Government has finally broken its silence on the 
Macenta affair, deploring, and I quote, the clash on our 
territory by warring factions in Liberia. [no reference to end 
of quote as heard] The statement issued after a cabinet meeting 
said that the government is taking very strong measures to 
protect our people and their property and calm has now returned 
to Macenta. According to the statement an investigation into 
the deadly clash is continuing and the findings will be made 
known internationally. 
  Meanwhile, in revenge for the attack on Macenta, a former 
member of parliament for Lofa County in Liberia, Musa Boney 
Camara, had his house and car burnt down in Bambala near the 
Liberian border. Camara is widely considered to be the ULIMO 
representative in the area. Another victim was Karamoko 
Modjenga, who is believed to be furnishing ULIMO fighters with 
traditional bulletproofs and other invincible charms in their 
battle against Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia. Karamoko Modjenga had his house razed to the ground 
and his personal mosque built inside the compound was also 
destroyed. 
  Meanwhile, the people of Macenta, in solidarity with their 
Loma kith and kin in Liberia, have threatened to blow up the 
whole area if ULIMO is not completely driven out. A Guinean 
Loma elder in Conakry told me that they have been holding 
meetings here in Conakry and contributing generously toward this 
task.

  [Text] Monrovia, 17 Jan (AFP) -- Liberia's main armed 
faction, the National Patriotic Front (NPFL), has partially 
reopened the main highway between its headquarters in the 
eastern town of Gbarnga and the capital Monrovia. 
  The opening of the road, announced Monday by NPFL radio, was 
seen as more symbolic than meaningful, since rival factions from 
Liberia's three-year civil war are still moving towards 
demobilisation and disarmament. 
  A rival armed group, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), 
was still blocking traffic at Kakata, 55 kilometres (35 miles) 
north of Monrovia, on a stretch of the same highway where the 
NPFL roadblock was raised Saturday. 
  The ULIMO blockade was imposed in retaliation for the 
kidnapping last week of 11 ULIMO fighters, blamed by ULIMO on 
Charles Taylor's NPFL, and a refusal by aid agencies to supply 
territory it controls in the north and west of Liberia. 
  The raising of the NPFL blockade was welcomed by Liberia's 
interim government, which controls the capital and its 
surrounding territory. 
  However, an official communique warned the step could only 
be 
a "significant contribution to peace" when all roadblocks and 
security checks are dismantled and control of roads is handed 
over to the multinational peacekeeping force ECOMOG. 
  A source close to the Nigerian-led ECOMOG, first posted in 
Liberia in August 1990, stressed that roadblocks should only be 
raised when disarmament had started. 
  Liberia has enjoyed a brittle peace since July when warring 
factions signed an agreement to lay down their arms and disband 
by mid-January. 
  Organisation of African Unity representative in Liberia 
Enoch 
Dogolea greeted the NPFL move with a call for the United Nations 
to speed up Liberia's peace process at a ceremony marking the 
highway opening.

  [Text] Fighting between the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] 
and Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
has intensified in Sino County in the southeast of Liberia, and 
as Nii Artey Allison reports in this telex from Monrovia, the 
weekend's fighting saw the Peace Council making substantial 
advances against the NPFL. [read by announcer] 
  NPFL sources confirmed yesterday that the Liberian Peace 
Council overran Paynestown last week, bringing to six the number 
of main towns in Upper Sino County now under LPC control. A 
resident of NPFL territory told me yesterday that NPFL officials 
were trying to play down the losses. The NPFL named 
(Gettyporg), Po River, (Pankfield), Lexington, and Buto as other 
towns lost to the LPC in the last four weeks. 
  It was confirmed yesterday that Charles Taylor has replaced 
top battlefront commanders responsible for the Sino and 
Rivercess region to strengthen NPFL defenses in the area. 
According to several NPFL commandos whom I spoke with, the LPC 
had entered Sino County by amphibious landing craft to the port 
of Greenville. 
  Meanwhile, the NPFL reopened its portion of the Gbarnga to 
Kakata highway yesterday before a sizable crowd of residents 
from Gbarnga. United Nations staff and diplomats also attended 
the occasion at Kanela Mission School campus, 40 miles north of 
Monrovia. The highway was closed when the NPFL attacked 
Monrovia in October 1992. However, the reopening of the NPFL 
section of the highway may make little difference since ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] imposed a 
blockade on the highway some two weeks ago. Recently a 12-car 
convoy of UN staff, ambassadors from the United States, Lebanon, 
and Egypt, and journalists, including myself, were held up for 
two hours by ULIMO forces brandishing assault rifles and rocket 
propelled grenades. One ULIMO commander shouted: Turn back, 
turn back. You stupid people are the ones causing the problem 
here. The situation was later brought under control by the 
colonel in charge of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] Kakata Command.

  [Excerpt] The devaluation of the CFA franc has brought 
price hikes in its wake. In the opinion of Alhaji Boubacar 
Bagourmi, secretary general of the National Union of Niger 
Traders, these unilateral price hikes are justified only if 
commercial agreements entered into are prior to the date of 
devaluation. Alhaji Bagourmi appealed to traders: 
  [Begin Bagourmi recording] There are several cases and 
situations, and each situation has its own case. Those who did 
not purchase their goods on credit but have bought them earlier 
should not take advantage of this situation to increase prices. 
Those who have already ordered and paid for their stock should 
not increase prices. [end recording] 
  In fact, the devaluation of the CFA franc continue to have 
ripple effects in the interior of the country. At Tillabery, 
all the shops have been closed since this morning, as Soumana 
Aboubacar, our correspondent in Tillabery, noticed. 
  [Begin Aboubacar recording] The panic created here and there 
by the devaluation of the CFA franc took time to reach 
Tillabery. Since this morning almost all of the meager economic 
activities in this small provincial capital have come to a 
standstill. A tour of the central market and along the main 
commercial streets enabled us to see that all the shops have 
closed. It is impossible to buy the smallest article from any 
shop if it was not bought the previous day. The only grocery 
shop which remains open, for the moment, is the Cash and Store.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It is becoming increasingly obvious that General 
Sani Abacha's military regime in Nigeria will brook no public 
opposition. Already, protests by Ogoni people have been squashed 
and the leaders arrested. A rally by maverick businessman, 
Arthur Nzeribe, was interrupted by security forces, and now the 
police have issued a warning that the authorities will not 
accept any public political statements, which sounds ominously 
like a gag on freedom of speech. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports. 
  [Begin recording] The tough statement from Police Federal 
Headquarters in Abuja warned those described as members of the 
political class to stop making statements, which it said, were 
capable of threatening government's good intentions to bequeath 
a viable democratic institution in the country. The police said 
that it would not tolerate any further political statement at 
this period of a ban on political activities. It said that 
those who had positive contributions to make towards the 
political development of Nigeria should wait until the proposed 
constitutional conference commission was inaugurated or else 
risk arrest and possible prosecution. 
  Shortly before the statement was issued, about 50 armed 
policemen aborted the press conference called in Lagos by the 
leader of the Association for a Better Nigeria, Chief Arthur 
Nzeribe. The policemen turned back journalists from the venue, 
which ironically was the property of the Nigerian Union of 
Journalists. Later, Chief Nzeribe described the police action 
as unfortunate and he said that it undermined the very 
foundation of democracy. Last weekend, Chief Nzeribe said that 
the government of Gen. Sani Abacha was incapable of solving 
Nigeria's complex political crisis and it should therefore 
resign and hand over to a civilian government of national unity. 
  Two days ago, former presidential contestant, Major Gen. 
Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, called for the immediate restoration of the 
right to free association and free speech. Addressing 
journalists in Lagos, he suggested that the decisions of the 
proposed constitutional conference should not be subject to 
approval by the Provisional Ruling Council and he advised the 
military government to ensure that its tenure did not extend 
beyond the end of this year. Such statements are now covered by 
the police warning. 
  However, the government today constituted the National 
Constitutional Conference Commission. It has 19 members, most 
of whom are well-known politicians from across the country. It 
is headed by a retired justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, 
Alhaji Saidu Kawu. The commission's terms of reference are 
expected to be announced at its formal inauguration next week.

  [Excerpt] Nigeria and Cuba, today in Lagos, signed the 
protocol for the implementation of the cultural and educational 
agreement between the two countries. Kobalakin Pong reports 
that the accord was signed on behalf of Nigeria by the minister 
of information and culture, Professor Jerry Gana, while the 
Cuban ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Giraldo Mazola, initialed the 
document for his country. 
  [Begin Pong recording] The agreement on cultural and 
educational cooperation between Nigeria and Cuba was signed in 
1981. The accord, according to Prof. Gana, had brought more 
awareness of the benefits to be derived from closer economic, 
cultural, and educational cooperation between the two countries.

  [Excerpt] The chairman of the National Provisional Ruling 
Council [NPRC] and head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser, 
has said that 1993 ended in an atmosphere characterized by a 
heightening of public confidence in Sierra Leone and the 
country's capacity to face the daunting challenges ahead. 
Speaking in Freetown this morning during his annual reception 
for heads of diplomatic missions and international organizations 
accredited to this country, Capt. Strasser said one of such 
challenges is the sustenance of that public confidence which is 
essential to the revival of meaningful investment in the private 
sector. 
  According to the head of state, the major preoccupations of 
the NPRC since the 29 April Revolution have basically been 
three-fold. These include the speedy conclusion of the rebel 
war, the structural reform of the economy to achieve sustainable 
growth, and the return to democratic constitutional rule. The 
NPRC government, he said, has recorded considerable progress 
although more will remain to be done. 
  Capt. Strasser explained how as evidence of his government's 
good faith and determination to effect an early end to the war, 
it had declared a unilateral cease-fire for four weeks and 
renewed the amnesty offered last December which was flagrantly 
violated by the rebels who are apparently not interested in 
peace. He said as [the] message of cease-fire and amnesty was 
not acceptable to most rebels, they used the cease-fire period 
to regroup and rearm for an offensive against government troops. 
The head of state used the opportunity to recall what he called 
the abiding appreciation of the government and people of Sierra 
Leone to all friendly countries and organizations who have 
helped (?in our efforts) in diverse ways. 
  Turning to the question of reconstruction and rehabilitation 
of the war-affected areas, Capt. Strasser appealed to the 
international community to augment and complement our scarce 
resources. He recalled the 26th of November last year when he 
launched the (?constitutional) program which heralded the 
irreversible process of returning this country to democratic 
civilian rule, culminating in elections in 1995. 
  Capt. Strasser assured his audience of the NPRC's 
determination to ensure that the transition program is not 
derailed and hoped that with the recent constitution of the 
electoral commission, donor countries and agencies will now be 
in a position to define their response to requests for 
assistance. 
  With regard to economic reform, the head of state said we 
have gone the extra mile towards fulfilling all of the 
conditionalities imposed by the IMF and the World Bank. He 
maintained that having removed all the distortions and with the 
needed assistance, it is expected that the national economy will 
ultimately take off, bringing in its wake the restoration of 
social progress. Capt. Strasser said social progress was 
subject to less unfavorable conditions in externally economic 
environment and called for improved access of our products to 
the international market and the guarantee for fair and 
reasonable remuneration for our exports. 
  Capt. Strasser called for the globalization of the principle 
of aid for serious political reforms by the Group of Seven 
industrialized countries and emphasized that West African 
countries, more than any group, deserve to be (?beneficiaries) 
of this new principle. He underscored our commitment to 
regional cooperation under the aegis of ECOWAS [Economic 
Community of West African States] and emphasized our 
(?unflinching) support for the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia. 
Capt. Strasser called on the warring factions to respect the 
accord and disarm and urged ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] to put the buffer zone along the Sierra-Leone-Liberia 
border in place to prevent any further [word indistinct] border 
military activities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After the reaction of the Confederation of Workers' 
Trade Unions on the devaluation of the CFA franc, it is the turn 
of the National Confederation of Workers of Togo, CNTT, to 
express their view on the devaluation of the CFA franc. Mr. 
Douevi Tchiviakou, secretary general of the CNTT, spoke to us 
about the CNTT's anxieties. 
  [Begin Tchiviakou recording] We have observed price hikes in 
basic food items. Some shops have even closed down for 
speculation purposes. The serious consequences of this decision 
is the loss of purchasing power of workers who are already hard 
hit by the economic crisis. That is why, in order to avoid 
social explosion, the National Confederation of Workers of Togo 
calls on all workers to remain calm in order to enable to take 
the necessary contacts with the government and businessmen so 
that the backup measures already announced can effectively be 
implemented. 
  Furthermore, the CNTT calls on the government and 
businessmen 
to expedite action in bringing down price hikes presently noted 
in some shops and in the markets. [end recording]

  [Text] We start the news bulletin with the following 
last-minute piece of information: Major General Juvenal 
Habyarimana, the president of the Republic, said he was amazed 
at the words of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and those 
of the prime minister designate, Faustin Twagiramungu, words 
broadcast on Radio Rwanda on 16 and 17 January 1993, 
respectively. This is stated in a communique issued by the 
Office of the President of the Republic. 
  According to the communique, the head of state regretted 
that 
high-level leaders like them continue to make multi-faceted 
statements unlikely to help the establishment of the broad-based 
transitional institutions and described the statements as a show 
of force. 
  According to the same communique, the president said that it 
is (?inconceivable) that the country is ruled through 
communiques while there is another perfectly adequate way to 
rule the country: in the spirit of the fundamental law which 
recommends consultations within the Council of Ministers. 
  The communique, which reached us today, is signed by the 
principal private secretary of the president of the Republic, 
Enoch Ruhigira.

  [Excerpts] The Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], 
Liberal Party [PL], Social Democrat Party [PSD], and Christian 
Democratic Party [PDC] political parties held a news conference 
at Umubano Meridien Hotel in Kigali yesterday. The news 
conference focused on the head of state's 15 January speech and 
also gave suggestions on preparations for the swearing in 
ceremony of members of parliament and members of the broad-based 
transitional government. 
  In a press release, the political parties expressed 
satisfaction with the president of the Republic's decision to 
give a specific date for the swearing in of MP's and ministers. 
They requested that the protocol of the ceremonies must be 
agreed jointly between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] and that the UN secretary general's special 
representative to Rwanda should be kept informed of it. The 
rest of the communique is read to us by Landuald Ndasingwa, 
first deputy chairman of the PL: 
  [Begin recording] The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political 
parties 
state that the program of the swearing-in ceremony must be 
agreed between the Rwandan Government and the RPF and that the 
UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda should be notified of it. The 
president of the Republic, for his part, should not intervene in 
the ceremonies. He should only intervene on a symbolic basis in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Arusha peace 
accord. 
  The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties call once again 
on the president of the Republic to stop interfering in the 
selection of ministers of the broad-based transitional 
government. In fact, this prerogative is that of the prime 
minister designate in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph Two, 
and Article 52 of the protocol on power-sharing. It is 
therefore clear that the president of the Republic is not 
empowered to approve or reject names of ministers submitted to 
him by the prime minister for appointment after having selected 
them in consultation with the relevant authorities. 
  On the establishment of the Transitional National Assembly, 
the MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties call on the 
president of the Republic to respect scrupulously the principle 
which he himself evoked in his 15 January message, and we quote 
him: The peace accord does not empower a person or body to 
remove from political bodies the prerogatives given to them by 
the same accord, end of quote. 
  The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties hope that this 
time the president of the Republic will respect the program of 
the ceremony establishing the remaining transitional 
institutions. [passage omitted] 
  The MDR, PSD, PDC, and PL political parties remind the 
president of the Republic that from the date he was sworn in on 
5 January, he is expected to respect the provisions of Articles 
Four and 12 of the protocol on power-sharing which says that he 
no longer has the capacity to make decisions outside the 
broad-based transitional government and that the content of 
messages he addresses to the nation must first be approved by 
the Council of Ministers. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Nairobi 18 Jan (KNA) -- Africa should strive to 
strengthen its media network in order to integrate itself in 
matters pertaining to development, the minister for information 
and broadcasting, Mr Johnstone Makau, has said. He said there 
was need for an African media network with an African perception 
which could gather and disseminate information without bias. Mr 
Makau said that the western media agencies had a tendency of 
highlighting calamities, conflicts and poverty. 
  The minister said this today when he received the Malawian 
minister for information, broadcasting and tourism, Professor 
D.S.J. Mkandawire, who paid him a courtesy call in the office. 
He said that with the strengthening of the existing African 
media network African countries will be abe to learn from one 
another and be improved of what is taking place in various 
countries. 
  The minister said western media agencies always approached 
African events and incidents from the "European approach" and 
hence the need to finance and develop the pan-African news 
agency-PANA. He said there was exaggeration and distortion of 
news by the western media who expected African countries to 
achieve what they have managed to achieve in their 200 years of 
independence. 
  Mr Makau told the local journalists that they had an 
obligation to inform the public objectively and avoid "yellow 
journalism", adding that they should be patriotic to their 
country. Mr Makau told the Malawian minister that Kenya had 
over 54 publications which included dailies and weekly 
magazines, some of which cropped up during the transitional 
period to democracy. He said that the Kenya Broadcasting 
Corporation radio station was able to reach 85 percent of the 
population while 40 percent were able to receive television. 
  Professor Mkandawire said that in Malawi there was a cry for 
professional journalistic skills particularly during this period 
where the country [is] undergoing political changes. He said 
there was freedom of expression in Malawi as his government 
never interfered with the operation fo the press. 
  Those who attended the meeting included the acting Malawian 
ambassador to Kenya, Mr Maweya Phiri, and the permanent 
secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Mr 
David Andere.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Washington Economizing, Threat </F>
Remains" -- "U.S. Base in Botswana Scaled Down"] 
  [Text] The Clinton government in Washington is still 
clinging to its plan for an air force base in Botswana, aimed at 
political intimidation of whites in South Africa if they should 
prove to be a threat. Although it was expected that the U.S. 
would shelve the project, the base will be significantly smaller 
than originally planned. It has been reported that white 
welders are being recruited in South Africa to assist with the 
construction of "steel structures" near Gaborone, later 
identified as oil tanks necessary for the fuel supply to the 
planned air force base. This information confirms earlier 
reports that the rail link from Gaborone to the American base, 
approximately 90 kilometers from the town, will not be built 
anymore, otherwise the tanks would have been built on the base. 
It is said that without the rail linkage the military 
capabilities of the base will only be a quarter of what it would 
be with rail links. 
  The base is being completed under huge financial pressure. 
The American defense budget has been drastically cut and will 
be further reduced. Several U.S. air force bases have been 
closed and the construction of new bases contravenes the 
country's fiscal policy. Added to this is the change in the 
French government's Africa policy. From the expected 1 billion 
rand cost of the project, the figure now stands at 2 billion 
rand. The French, whose contribution to the cost of the base 
would be approximately 700 million rands, chiefly undertaken for 
a contract to be awarded to the French concern Batignolles -- 
with Anglo American and LTA as subcontractors -- do not want to 
pump any more money into the project. French Prime Minister 
Balladur, in a sensational shift in policy, discontinued all 
financial assistance to black African states. 
  The cost of the base, at the escalated cost of 2 billion 
rand, means that there is a significant shortage of funds and 
were it not for the political importance of such a base, 
construction plans would have been dropped. The fact that it is 
still being completed on its drastically reduced budget hints at 
the American determination to use the project as a political 
threat against the whites of South Africa. According to reports 
the original plan was to transfer American troops stationed in 
Somalia, to the new base in Botswana in April. It is still 
possible that a small force may fly from Mogadishu to the 
Botswana base, but in the meanwhile, the political clout of 
Clinton's opponents, including Ross Perrot, has increased to 
such an extent that the deployment of any American troops in 
Africa is a political risk he can do without. It is said that 
the whites should, therefore, not be intimidated by the American 
military exhibition but that it should be realistically 
evaluated. The military threat from Botswana has probably not 
disappeared, but at least we are aware of the size of the threat.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 18 SAPA -- The leadership of the 
African National Congress [ANC], the Natal Indian Congress and 
the Transvaal Indian Congress resolved at a meeting on Tuesday 
[18 January] to mobilise a broad range of people under the ANC 
banner. In a joint statement the organisations noted that "the 
best hope for peace, prosperity and stability lies in decisive 
ANC electoral victory". 
  Such an election win could only be achieved by "building the 
broadest unity of all sectors into a front, within the Indian 
community, behind the ANC". 
  The meeting -- attended by ANC President Nelson Mandela -- 
also resolved to develop joint programmes to reach out to 
communities on a door-to-door and sector-to-sector basis, and to 
build a credible leadership platform to effectively address the 
Indian community.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] is stepping up 
security at its offices countrywide following two blasts in four 
days. An explosion caused extensive damage to the organization's 
offices in Bothaville in the [Orange] Free State last night. 
Caro Kriel reports that the two attacks have raised questions 
about free poliical activity in the run-up to the election. 
  [Begin recording] [Kriel] The Free State town of Bothaville 
is known for its fertile farmland and right-wing politics. Five 
months ago the ANC opened an office in the main street. Last 
night it was damaged in an explosion believed to have been 
caused by commercial explosives. No one was injured. More than 
100,000 rands' damage was caused, but ironically nearby shops 
suffered the most. Local ANC leaders allege that the right wing 
is behind the attacks. They say there was trouble from the 
beginning. 
  [ANC spokesman Steven Mathibe] There was a group of the 
right 
wing who were here with the intention to stop the leadership 
from opening these offices. 
  [Kriel] The owner of the pharmacy next to the ANC offices 
said this comes as no surprise. 
  [Pharmacist Mannetjie van der Linde] Unfortunately the 
political situation in this town is so that a thing like that 
must have been expected. 
  [Kriel] Just 4 nights ago the ANC office in Harrismith, 
another small Free State farming town, was attacked in the same 
way. Commercial explosives were also used. Police are 
investigating a possible link with the Bothaville blast. With 
little over 3 months before the election, one wonders whether 
what has happened in Harrismith and here is only the beginning. 
The police say they are expecting similar terror attacks from 
the left and the right, and are planning for it. [end recording]

nominated to be on the ANC list for election, but they remain in 
their positions at the SABC. So I think that they should either 
resign from the SABC, or declare that they are not ANC 
candidates. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 18 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] would get 70.3 per cent of votes in the coming 
elections if its support in the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, 
Venda, Ciskei] states was taken into account, according to the 
Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC]. In a statement on 
Tuesday the HSRC said it had processed data not included in its 
November/December survey which put the ANC's support at 67 per 
cent. 
  The National Party's support was 15.5 per cent compared to 
tte HSRC's earlier estimate of 17 per cent without taking the 
TBVC states into consideration. The Inkatha Freedom Party could 
count on 4.5 per cent, compared to the previous six per cent 
forecast. 
  The Conservative Party's support remained at three per cent, 
while support for other right-wing parties slipped from two per 
cent to 1.8 per cent, taking the TBVc states into account. 
  The "large discrepancy" between the ANC's support in the PWV 
region (71 per cent) and nationally (67 per cent, excluding TBVC 
states) was largely due to the influence of Natal-kwaZulu and 
the Western Cape, the statement said. 
  The ANC was the largest party in natal but obtained only 50 
per cent of the vote, while in the Western Cape the ANC was the 
party chosen by 36 per cent of those surveyed. 
  Spoilt papers were a "very serious prospect" and the HSRC 
was 
attempting to encourage and assist voter education efforts.

[PAC] central Transkei region on Tuesday [18 January] expressed 
its shock and disgust at what it termed the PAC's unilateral 
decision, announced on Sunday, to suspend its armed struggle. 
PAC Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha said the move was not in 
line with national conference resolutions taken in Umtata last 
year. 
  "The conference mandated the PAC leadership to negotiate a 
mutual cessation of hostilities with the regime. This move is 
nothing but capitulation and renegation on the part of the PAC 
leadership," Mr Skwatsha said. 
  He called for a special conference for the PAC leadership to 
explain its decision.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 19 SAPA -- To prevent violence if a 
deadlock in negotiations occurred the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] was prepared to go for international 
mediation, Afrikaner Volksfront leader General Constand Viljoen 
said on Wednesday [19 January]. He told a media briefing in 
Pretoria the mediation should be on the scale of that of the 
Palestinian/Israeli option. 
  Gen Viljoen accused the government and the African National 
Congress [ANC] of "stalling tactics" in negotiations and the 
Freedom Alliance had been put in a "pressure chamber" with four 
days left before the constitutional deadline. 
  With a deadlock in the negotiations looming, the AVF was 
prepared to use "as little violence as possible" to achieve its 
goal of self- determination, Gen Viljoen said. Although the AVF 
was still committed to a peaceful negotiated settlement, "there 
is no way the Afrikaner can be forced into a new situation and 
new nation as you make instant coffee", the general said. 
  He re-iterated that the AVF's own transitional authority 
would be implemented in public in Pretoria on January 29 to be 
mandated to "lead the Afrikaner to freedom". The AVF had made 
enquiries about the international mediations and it could be 
available within a week, Gen Viljoen added. 
  He could not divulge more information due to the sensitive 
nature, he said.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 18 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[AVF, Afrikaner National Front] has decided to implement its 
transitional authority in Pretoria on January 29 to lead the 
Afrikaner to freedom, Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg announced on Tuesday night. The decision was taken 
by the AVF on Tuesday, Dr Hartzenberg told a public meeting in 
Pretoria. 
  Representatives of the Afrikaner volk [people] across the 
country would be invited to attend the occasion to sanction the 
body to plan and take decisions for the Afrikaner and to mandate 
it to "achieve our freedom before the April 27 elections", he 
said. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said although the Freedom Alliance, the 
government and the African National Congress [ANC] would be 
meeting on Wednesday "we don't expect much to come from the 
talks". He added that it did not matter what they (the 
government and the ANC) decided, the Afrikaner was marching to 
freedom and self-determination. 
  Dr Hartzenberg warned that the Afrikaner should not be 
forced 
to become the enemy of those who wanted to force an unjust 
dispensation on them. Accusing the media of trying to drive a 
wedge between him and AVF leader Constand Viljoen, Dr 
Hartzenberg said they had a "hearty" relationship. 
  The implementation of the AVF's own transitional authority 
was proof that the Afrikaner was determinedly on the way to 
freedom and would not be ruled by the communist-dominated ANC, 
he said. Surveys showed the ANC would get most votes in seven 
of the nine provinces, which meant the Afrikaner would be 
dominated on central, provincial and local levels, he added. 
  An Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] could still secure a 
peaceful solution "at this late hour" and amendments to the 
constitution could be made before the end of the month, Dr 
Hartzenberg said. A plebiscite could be held to determine who 
wanted to be included in the homeland. This could be completed 
in March so that elections could take place in the volkstaat 
while the rest of the people voted in the general elections, he 
said. 
  In Pretoria, earmarked as the capital of the proposed 
volkstaat, more than half of the residents had indicated they 
wanted to be included in the volkstaat, he claimed. 
  Dr Hartzenberg also called on the city's thousands of civil 
servants to make themselves available for the volkstaat because 
they had been "cheated" out of their job security and pensions 
by State President F W de Klerk. 
  Pretoria City Council CP leader Paul Fouche called on 
supporters to a gathering at the downtown municipal offices on 
January 25 to protest against the new joint non-racial local 
government dispensation. Pamphlets would be distributed in 
Pretoria to call supporters to "drastic but non-violent" action 
to protest the 50/50 dispensation, he said.

  [Text] The peace plan being finalised by President F.W. de 
Klerk and ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson 
Mandela is believed to include the withdrawal of the SAP's 
[South African Police] internal stability unit from all East 
Rand townships tomorrow and the eviction of hostel residents 
without permits. 
  ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] deputy 
secretary-general Obed Bapela disclosed these details at the 
funeral of an ANC self-defence unit member in Katlehong 
yesterday. Two people were shot and injured at the funeral. 
  De Klerk and Mandela met yesterday to finalise the plan but 
could not complete the task and scheduled further meetings. 
Spokesmen refused to disclose details until a final agreement 
was reached. However, De Klerk said proposals included boosting 
security force manpower and the SADF's [South African Defense 
Force] role and addressing socio-economic problems, such as 
housing and education. All parties which had a bearing on 
violence had to be consulted, including the Inkatha Freedom 
Party. 
  Bapela said the ANC had met East Rand self-defence units and 
they had agreed that policemen would not be targets. He urged 
the community to welcome the SADF. The ANC had demanded 
photographs of all internal stability unit members so they could 
be excluded from the police force.

  [Editorial Report] THE STAR 
  PAC Decision To End Armed Struggle Welcome -- The 
Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) decision to end the armed struggle 
"is an excellent development," declares a page 12 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 18 January. "Yes, many 
South Africans will feel angered at Clarence Makwetu's blithe 
announcement, after years of disingenuously denying that the PAC 
had any control over its armed wing." Although the cease fire 
will "take some time to come into force" we "can look forward to 
less killing." The country can "look with some confidence 
towards a more inclusive election." Ultimately, the "legitimacy 
of the transition process has been bolstered by Makwetu's 
announcement." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Economic Promises -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English 
on 18 January in a page 4 editorial finds the African National 
Congress (ANC) alliance's Reconstruction and Development Program 
"more specific about the promises" it is making. But, "is it 
specific enough about the macroeconomic context in which they 
will be delivered?" "It is not enough to say that 'undue 
inflation' and balance of payments problems should be avoided. 
An overheating economy, with soaring inflation and high 
imports, could bring the programme to a premature end. A 
stronger commitment is needed on macroeconomic discipline, as 
unpalatable as that might be politically." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Editorial Calls for Moderate Front Against ANC -- The 
"Comment" column on page 14 of Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 
on 16 January analyzes the ANC's election manifesto and its 
"so-called program of reconstruction" which it says "even 
frightens political appeasers of the past year. Even the most 
optimistic of them can no longer believe what they had earlier 
announced with great positiveness: That the ANC has renounced 
nationalization and that it had become a protagonist of a free 
market system with a little tinge of socialism merely for the 
sake of its constituency." Hopefully it will make those who 
applauded Mr. Mandela's so-called "assurance" more careful. It 
appears that as election day draws closer, and the ANC feels 
increasingly assured of an election victory, "the organization 
is bent on getting its grip on any support it can get hold of -- 
from education to mines, from land ownership to the civil 
service." "It is a good thing that the ANC's ominous future plan 
for totalitarian state control and interference became known 
just in time -- in time by all moderate people and parties 
involved in the present negotiations for a new dispensation." 
"Due to the ANC's radical socialist and racist principles, such 
negotiations are gaining a totally new urgent dimension. What 
is important right now is to stop the ANC on 27 April." 
"Participation must be the password to all. The basis for a 
broad moderate front against the ANC must be established without 
delay. After 27 April it will all be too late."

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] There is an apparent war of disinformation under way 
in Angola: there are many contradictory reports concerning the 
evolution of the Lusaka peace talks. Correspondents in the 
Zambian capital say that the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] has made concessions, in the wake 
of the government's refusal to disband the Riot Police, also 
known as ninjas. News agencies with representatives in Luanda 
are citing an article carried by the JORNAL DE ANGOLA newspaper 
today saying that the talks are deadlocked and that prospects 
for an accord are rather dim. What is more, those news agencies 
report that the Angolan Government and UNITA teams have not 
achieved any consensus over the general principles that will 
guide the formation of the future national police force. Joao 
van Dunem, a BBC Portuguese Service reporter, interviewed UNITA 
Information Secretary Jorge Valentim this afternoon and he 
affirmed that consensus has already been reached on the general 
principles that will govern the formation of the future police 
force. Dr. Jorge Valentim added that only the specifics of that 
matter are being discussed now. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] The talks are going very well. 
After we had defined the general principles of the legal 
framework governing the creation and operation of the police 
force in a legal state, we moved on to discuss specific 
principles. UNITA has presented a document containing more than 
18 points and it has to do with specific principles which also 
concern the Riot Police. Our approach was creative, 
imaginative, and realistic. It is our view that, in any legal 
state, the national police has certain special functions. Now, 
we have policemen, said to be riot policemen or whatever other 
name they may have been given, who are acting within the context 
of a legal framework. 
  [Dunem] That means, then, that the legal framework has been 
defined in full and that the government and UNITA have reached 
consensus? 
  [Valentim] There is already (?common) ground. The framework 
has been defined, even with regard to UNITA's participation: 
the way the police force will operate, who does what, when the 
police force should intervene, and what its limits are. All 
that has been defined. We can tell you that, contrary to what 
has been reported by some international circles, things are 
moving forward. The only problem is that legal work is rather 
picky and sensitive work and we were not helped by the fact that 
such legal work had not been done before. So, it has taken a 
while but now there are concrete results. 
  [Dunem] That means, then, that the Lusaka peace talks are 
now 
focusing on specific principles? 
  [Valentim] Absolutely. We are discussing specific principles 
and also regulations. Since when does a riot police force 
abandon its barracks to intervene in social affairs that should 
be the responsibility of political and administrative 
authorities? Such a police force should only intervene, and 
then in accordance with the law, once it has become clear that 
the normal police force does not have the means to restore 
order, after which they must promptly return to their barracks. 
Those are things that were not enshrined in the law. 
  [Dunem] Dr. Valentim: at the weekend, Savimbi signed a 
communique which observers have perceived to be a clear 
declaration of war. That communique says that, unless the 
international community recognizes the (?flaws) in the September 
1992 elections and the concessions that have been made by UNITA, 
the Lusaka peace talks are just a waste of time. What did Dr. 
Savimbi mean by that? 
  [Valentim] Well, I would like to say that a correct 
interpretation of UNITA President Dr. Savimbi's thoughts will 
show that this was in response to a situation seen from within: 
there is ever growing tension in the country because of the 
movements of government forces. The UNITA president was just 
urging the international community to exert greater pressure to 
prevent warmongering (?moves) in the country. UNITA believes in 
the talks but, by the same token, the international community 
must not just fold its arms in the face of Angola's increasingly 
serious situation. 
  [Dunem] Just to conclude, Dr. Valentim, I would like to cite 
another passage from that communique: quote, we, in UNITA, are 
not pacifists, unquote. What is that supposed to mean? 
  [Valentim] That means that the government is attacking many 
UNITA positions. If UNITA is forced to defend itself so it can 
survive, then UNITA will not fold its arms. [end recording]

  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks are continuing with UN 
Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye at the helm. Their 
pace has been slow but sure. That slowness is understandable 
because of the complexity of the process for the resolution of a 
conflict that is, itself, very complex. The first point in the 
political talks has to do with the formation of the new national 
police force and the two sides have been discussing it since 6 
January so they can then discuss national reconciliation issues. 
Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] information secretary and the 
deputy chief of the UNITA team to the Lusaka peace talks, has 
rejected all reports of a deadlock at the talks. He has told 
Radio France International that the talks continue to make 
progress and that there are clear hopes for an accord. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] Instead of being held in the 
style of the Bicesse talks, these talks on the formation of the 
new police force have been held in an extremely serious manner, 
and from the point (?of view of) [words indistinct] that is 
possible and democratic is always on the negotiating table. 
That is why people have become accustomed to (?more dynamic 
talks) and now, when you see a debate [words indistinct] that is 
seen as deadlock. There is no deadlock at all. Rather, there 
are serious discussions under way. (?The other side) has 
replied to our document and we can say that valid theories for a 
legal state (?have been advanced). We hope that the mediators 
-- who should be giving us the document today -- will have been 
able to reduce the gap between the two sides so that points of 
disagreement can be overcome. Nonetheless, discussions are 
under way and they are showing progress. There has been serious 
progress and, without entering into explanations for the benefit 
of the public, (?they should think) that things are moving 
forward. 
  [Unidentified reporter] And when will these police issue 
discussions be over, so that other issues can be examined, 
notably sharing power (?with) Luanda? 
  [Valentim] Once this point has been discussed, we will talk 
about national reconciliation and, as you can see, that issue is 
crucial for UNITA's substantive participation in government. 
However, it does not include all the [words indistinct] national 
reconciliation. There are various facets to it. That is why, 
when we get there, we will also be giving our views on how 
Angola should approach the national reconciliation issue. 
  [Reporter] That might mean, then, that talks could go on for 
several weeks yet? 
  [Valentim] Well, it is not a matter of the talks going on. 
These are serious talks. We are walking the burning coals of 
political differences. What happens is that many people thought 
the main differences would reside in military issues and that 
political issues would be easy to settle. In the final 
analysis, though, what we want to solve is the Angolan crisis 
and, to that end, we must define a political, legal, social, and 
economic framework so that the Angolan people can understand and 
accept each other. [end recording]

  [Text] Peace talks continue in Lusaka, without major news. 
The parties have not yet finished discussing the national 
police formation dossier. Joao Ligio reports: 
  Point one in the working agenda of the second round of peace 
talks has not yet been surpassed. Sources close to the peace 
talks feel the national police dossier could this week still 
become part of the documents signed by the parties during the 
first round of peace talks begun during the last days of last 
year. 
  After the amendments made yesterday to the proposal 
presented 
by the Black Cockerel's negotiators on the specific principles 
of Point One, dealing with the percentages of each party in the 
composition of the riot police, the mediator is expected to 
present his counterproposal. The joint reaction of the mediator 
and the troika, entitled the master document, should be 
presented to the parties tomorrow, taking into account the 
intense movement for exchanging correspondence registered today. 
We saw hotel doors opening and closing, with Alioune Blondin 
Beye's messengers going in and coming out.

<F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] In Luanda, attentions have been centering on the 
burning controversy surrounding the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola, MPLA, government's economic policies. 
After President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos had 
failed Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro's 1994 economic 
program, Prime Minister Marcolino Moco went to Parliament to 
inform it that the government would not be able to present this 
year's program of action by 20 January. Gustavo Costa, our 
correspondent in the Angolan capital, provides the details: 
  [Begin Costa recording] Yesterday, Prime Minister Marcolino 
Moco met with the MPLA deputies to the National Assembly to 
explain the government's inability to produce its 1994 program 
by 20 January. Instead, the Angolan prime minister presented a 
set of guidelines for the drawing up of new governing strategies 
and of the next state budget, under the watchful eye of 
Parliament, which intends to exert rigorous control over the 
implementation of the deadlines mentioned in the government 
program. The new outlines for the drawing up of the government 
program are now receiving great care, particularly in view of 
the fact that President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has rejected the 
program devised by Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro. 
  Some journalists feel that the Angolan head of state had no 
option but dismiss the finance minister's program, which 
proposed the continuation of the work done in 1993, even though 
many voices from various sectors have described administrative 
methods in use as the main culprits for the erosion of the 
Angolan economy. 
  Concerning the economic management style chosen by Finance 
Minister Carneiro [words indistinct] generating a wave of 
popular dissatisfaction that has been reflected in the paralysis 
of the industrial (?sector), the companies' lack of capital, the 
despair of Angolan entrepreneurs on the verge of bankruptcy, the 
lack of credibility of the banking system, an almost obscene 
[word indistinct] of foreign exchange rates, an extremely high 
inflation rate that encourages frightening levels of corruption, 
and promoting more and more crime, as well as uncontrolled and 
spiralling discontent. 
  In view of this scenario, the Angolan head of state had no 
option but order a new government program from Pedro Morais, 
secretary of state for planning. The keynote of that program 
should be liberalization, to allow President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos to garner dividends from the talks he will personally 
direct when an Angolan team attends the Paris Club meeting 
scheduled for February. Even though there has been no 
announcement concerning Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro's 
dismissal, the fact that the Angolan head of state rejected his 
program considerably undermines the role of the Finance 
Ministry. The expectation is that [words indistinct] the 
country's catastrophic financial situation [words indistinct] 
structural readjustment [words indistinct] management of the 
Angolan economy so that [words indistinct] the foreign debt as a 
means to convince financiers to open their purses and grant new 
loans. [end recording]

  [Text] Police Commissar Gaspar da Silva told the media 
yesterday that the Luanda Province National Police Command is 
not to ignore any form of demonstration that could threaten 
citizens' lives as well as national unity. That police officer 
also said that unidentified groups are distributing pamphlets in 
Luanda inciting people to engage in demonstrations to mark, on 
22 January, the first anniversary of the so-called bloody Friday. 
  [Begin Silva recording] Considering that the anniversary of 
the frightful so-called bloody Friday is around the corner, we 
assessed the situation and found that it had been aggravated by 
the distribution of certain pamphlets seeking to reignite 
tribal, regional, and even racial hatred. In view of that, the 
police must urgently take preventive measures to ensure that the 
aforesaid problems do not happen again. With that in mind, the 
Luanda Province National Police Command hereby urges the people 
to behave in a dignified manner and assume a responsible and 
patriotic posture by uniting behind the ideals of a prosperous 
fatherland that seeks progress. 
  By the same token, the Luanda Province National Police 
Command hereby alerts the people to the fact that it will not 
allow public order and calm -- both of which are much needed for 
our country's development and reconstruction -- to be disrupted 
by certain members of the public who obstinately and 
intentionally refuse to along with society's norms of 
coexistence. 
  The Luanda Province National Police Command hereby 
reiterates 
its call to the people of this city to cooperate with the forces 
of law and order, irrespective of their skin color, ethnic 
background, or the areas from which they come. The National 
Police Command will take the necessary preemptive and repressive 
measures to deal with all those insisting on committing unlawful 
acts that could lead to criminal proceedings in terms of Article 
188 of the Penal Code, which provides for a punishment of up to 
three months in jail. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The erosion of the Angolan economy is a source of 
instability to the social and economic lives of Angolan workers 
and there is no predicting what its future consequences might 
be. A report by the state media in Luanda on 17 January said 
that the state bank did not have the money to honor public 
service salaries. 
  That rather senseless report came as a shock to the various 
state departments and is already causing much resentment among 
public service workers, who have threatened to go on strike 
without notice should the matter not be urgently resolved. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Luanda say that delays in the 
payment 
of salaries or, simply, the decreasing buying power of salaries, 
have been the cause for many public service protests, including 
a strike by the workers with the Luanda Identification Archives 
and the threat of strike by Lobito Harbor workers. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Mozambique has condemned the violation of the 
national territory by the Swaziland Defense Forces perpetrated 
along the Mozambique-Swaziland border, according to a press 
release issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and sent to our 
news desk. The communique states that the condemnation was made 
during the Mozambique-Swaziland Joint Security Commission 
meeting held in Mbabane yesterday. The communique states that 
at the end of the meeting a joint statement was signed 
expressing the wish of the two countries to reinforce good 
neighborly relations within the framework of the preservation of 
peace and stabity in the two countries and in the region. The 
second theme during the discussion was the smuggling of cattle, 
arms, drugs, precious and semi-precious stones, power cables, 
vehicles, among others. The two sides noted the need to respect 
general principles of international law regarding patrolling and 
protecting common borders. The delegations to the meeting were 
led by Mozambican Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi and his Swazi 
counterpart Solomon Dlamini. Mocumbi returned home this 
afternoon.

  [Text] The first multiparty elections will be held in the 
country within 10 months. It is not a long time, but it is 
enough time for many things to happen which may determine, or at 
least greatly influence, the voting inclination. Thus, even if 
the opinion polls give a clue, it is not very wise to advance 
any predictions. 
  The weekly DOMINGO/Gestinform barometer of December notes an 
interesting aspect: the rise of almost all political leaders, 
with the exception of only three out of 11. 
  The spectacular rise was that of Joaquim Chissano, chairman 
of Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], by more than one 
point. Chissano rose from 5.8 points in November to 7.1 last 
December, a rise of 1.3. Why did Chissano rise from five 
immediately to seven? It is difficult to discover the reasons of 
those interviewed, but one is led to believe, as it has always 
been said, people forget very easily. The residents of Maputo 
-- where all the counting was carried out -- may have already 
forgotten about the fuel price increases decreed by the 
government, which led to the rise in the transport fares. This 
may be the case, since the Maputo residents won the battle, and 
the prices of the private taxi fares remain the same. 
  This rise should also be viewed, however, as a reward in 
view 
of the measure taken by the government, recommending an annual 
bonus... 
  Afonso Dhlakama's countrywide tour may probably have 
produced 
the desired effects, judging by the 0.9 point increase. 
  The person who is getting more and more popular of late 
despite his silence is Dr. Maximo Dias, leader of the Monamo 
[Mozambican Nationalist Movement]. The people are little by 
little discovering the consistence of his speeches and political 
positions. Some observers of the Mozambican process describe him 
as a new Sergio Vieira, who is emerging in the national 
parliament. The 0.4 rise explains it. 
  The person who is always active, flexible, and "champion" of 
press releases is Wehia Monakacho Ripua, the leader of Pademo 
[Mozambique Democratic Party]. The rise from 4.6 in November to 
5.5 in December only proves that despite the fact that he is 
considered "comic," the Maputo residents are getting to know him 
better. 
  The trip of Dr. Domingos Arouca, chairman of the Mozambique 
United Front-Democratic Convergence and National Reconstruction 
Party [Fumo-PCDRN], to Europe may have increased his credibility 
and seriousness among the public. With his 4.8 points in 
December, Domingos Arouca is still far from his most direct 
rivals in the presidential elections, Joaquim Chissano and 
Afonso Dhlakama, but his 0.3 point rise should certainly 
encourage him. 
  Lutero Simango, secretary for foreign affairs and member of 
the PCN [National Convention Party], acts quietly and subtly and 
is little by little scoring points, so that in December he rose 
by 0.1. It is difficult to understand how this politician acts 
and the reason for his acceptance among the public. Perhaps his 
recent statements on the death of his father may have influenced 
this. 
  Carlos Reis, who is a businessman and chairman of the 
Mozambican National Union [Unamo], is also rising in the grace 
of those interviewed, with an increase from 2.7 in November to 
2.9 in December. 
  A list of political leaders who have lost points follows: 
Padimbi Kamati (1.0), Casimiro Nhamitambo (1.5) and Martins 
Bilal (0.8). 
  Neves Pinto Serrano appears for the first in the opinion 
poll. For a person who dreams of residing in the "Ponta 
Vermelha" Palace in October, the points he received, 1.9, are 
not encouraging. 
  After a fall of 2.2 points from October to November, Foreign 
Affairs Minister Pascoal Mocumbi rose considerably from 4.0 to 
5.6 in December. This is probably due to the calm and 
thoughtfulness which characterize his activities in the current 
"hot potato" of the Mozambican diplomacy: the "Young pioneers" 
case. 
  In turn, Armando Guebuza, head of the government delegation 
in the CSC [Supervision and Control Commission], is still seeing 
his efforts in the tiresome exchange of words with Raul Domingos 
recognized by those interviewed in this opinion poll. His 0.1 
point justifies this. 
  The one who seems to be navigating in bad waters is Prime 
Minister Mario Machungo. Since October he has been continually 
losing popularity. In that month he had 3.2 points, in November 
2.8 and in December 2.0. However, it is easy to guess that 
Machungo's decrease in popularity is well justified by those 
complicated sums which only ended up increasing the Mozambican 
people's cost of living... 
  All of the opposition figures decreased! Ululu decreased by 
0.3 points, a decrease for the party of Jose Castro, whose trips 
through the country have not been assisting him to be popular. 
Raul Domingos, Afonso Dhlakama's "loud speaker" [preceding two 
words in English], neither rose nor decreased.

  [Text] In Maputo late this afternoon, the Supervision and 
Control Commission [CSC] interrupted its meeting on confinement 
problems. Faustino Igreja has further details. 
  [Begin recording] [Igreja] The General Peace Accord's 
Supervision and Control Commission will continue to discuss the 
confinement problems tomorrow, at a time when the government 
admits responsibility for the delay being observed in sending 
its men to confinement centers. Deputy Planning Minister Tomas 
Salomao led the government's delegation to the CSC meeting. 
  [Salomao] In practice, what is being observed in the field 
is 
that some confinement centers do not have the capacity to 
receive large numbers of troops. What is more, we experienced 
some logistical problems. The government is to blame for some 
of these problems, while institutions providing some products 
are to blame for other problems. Evidently, a process of this 
nature means that we were sending men to confinement centers and 
not pushing them there. All the same, we have reassessed the 
situation. We identified the critical points. It is true that 
there is some delay in the confinement process. The provincial 
commanders received instructions to speed up the process. Thus, 
when we assess the si??x&gt; [?n?er to comment about the statement 
made by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader that 
his movement would interrupt the confinement process if there is 
no greater flow of government men to confinement centers by 
Saturday [22 January]. 
  [Salomao] It is not a question of the government normalizing 
the situation by Saturday. It is a question of the parties 
carrying out their responsibilities. The government has its 
responsibilities in order to complete the number of troops to be 
sent to confinement centers. Renamo too has its 
responsibilities. If we see the numbers, we realize that it is 
not only on the government side that there is an imbalance. 
There is an imbalance on both sides. This being the case, the 
government has its responsibilities and Renamo too has its 
responsibilities. What the government has to do is to carry out 
its responsibilities and Renamo too must carry out its 
responsibilities. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. deputy minister, what is the 
situation at the moment regarding the collection of weapons at 
confinement centers? 
  [Salomao] There was a proposal made by the president of the 
Cease-Fire Commission to immediately begin to collect 50 percent 
of the materiel found in confinement centers. We agreed with 
this position since security conditions for weapons at 
confinement centers are not good. It is therefore important 
that the weapons collected are sent to regional warehouses where 
the United Nations, the government, and Renamo have access to 
these warehouses. 
  [Unidentified reporter] At the moment, we continue to 
experience riots by the armed forces. Some troops, who have not 
been confined, are raiding shops and blocking roads. Why can't 
we avoid these problems? 
  [Salomao] I cannot say that riots are continuing. There were 
incidents at Namialo, Cuamba, and Massinga. There are reasons 
for some of these incidents -- delays in processing salaries, 
bad logistical conditions -- while others were just acts 
disturbance and agitation. Corrective measures to resolve these 
problems have been adopted. The chief of the general staff is 
carrying out work in the northern and central regions to assess 
the situation. We are therefore correcting the situation. 
  [Igreja] During the CSC meeting, Radio Mozambique 
interviewed Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation. 
  [Domingos] We began a series of meetings today which, I 
think, will continue for a number of days. We shall meet again 
tomorrow and we are going to examine the report presented by the 
president of the Cease-Fire Commission today. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] President 
Dhlakama 
said that he would interrupt the confinement process if the 
government continues to drag its feet in confining its troops? 
  [Domingos] Well, we have this forum. We shall use it to 
present our [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Renamo therefore expects to 
interrupt 
the confinement of troops? 
  [Domingos] If that is necessary, we shall declare it here at 
the level of the commissions. 
  [[Unidentified reporter] You therefore deny the statement by 
the Renamo president? 
  [Domingos] I do not deny it. I am only saying that the 
statement made by my president will formally be presented here 
at the level of the commissions. 
  [Igreja] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN 
secretary general, thinks the situation will improve. 
  [Ajello] There is a report which was presented by the 
president of the Cease-Fire Commission on the confinement 
process. There are delays and there are problems. We are 
discussing these problems to see how we can resolve them and so 
that the parties can have the time to study the report from the 
president of the Cease-Fire Commission that we are going to 
present now. Tomorrow afternoon, at 1500, we shall resume our 
meeting and discuss the report. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you consider valid the 
government's reasoning that there are technical problems 
concerning the confinement process? 
  [Ajello] I want to understand what these problems are. If 
they are technical problems, we want to see how can assist in 
resolving them to have a correct confinement process, because 
now it is not progressing smoothly. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The Renamo president said that he is 
going to interrupt the confinement of Renamo forces if the 
government continues [words indistinct]? 
  [Ajello] I do not think the government will continue not 
confining its troops. The government is resolving the problem 
and beginning to confine troops in 15 areas approved in 
December. I do not believe there will be a need to disrupt the 
process. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Station commentary on the "Dotting the i's" program] </F>
  [Text] The burning issue of the Mozambican peace process at 
this stage is the confinement of government and Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] troops. For that reason, everyone 
is watching the figures for confined and demobilized soldiers, 
as such figures are made available. What we are witnessing from 
both sides is worrisome, particularly from the government's 
side. The truth is that practically no government forces went 
into their confinement points between 21 December of last year 
and 16 January. The UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, report 
cites zero government soldiers joining their confinement centers 
for almost each day that has passed since 21 December. By the 
way of an example, let us look at government soldier entries 
between 6 and 16 January: 
  6 January: zero soldiers; 
  7 January: zero soldiers; 
  8 January: zero soldiers; 
  9 January: zero soldiers; 
  10 January: one soldier; 
  11 January: zero soldiers; 
  12 January: six soldiers; 
  13 January: zero soldiers; 
  14 January: zero soldiers; 
  15 January: two soldiers; 
  16 January: zero soldiers. 
  Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao was the surprising head of the 
government team to yesterday's important meeting of the 
Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, to discuss the slow 
troop confinement. He provided two justifications for it: the 
accommodation centers' inability to take in so many soldiers -- 
after all, it seems that they take less soldiers than had been 
thought -- and some logistical problems. The truth, though, is 
that those explanations make no sense whatever. How can one say 
that the problem has to do with lack of accommodation if not 
even one soldier has made it yet to seven of those centers? Can 
it be that they are already full before even one soldier has 
arrived? 
  It is also difficult to believe that logistical problems 
could be a reason. For example, the city of Quelimane has one 
of the centers where not a single soldier has arrived yet. Can 
it possibly be that the soldiers stationed in the capital of 
Zambezia Province cannot be moved to a confinement center in the 
city itself? Can it be so difficult to supply centers that are 
mostly located in cities and villages? Deputy Minister Tomas 
Salomao expressed optimism because the last few days have 
already seen some entries. However, Unomoz only reports 
movement at one troop confinement point, that of Casa Banana, 
where 241 men arrived on 17 January. Not a single soldier made 
it to the other 20 assembly points. In view of this, the 
reasons presented by the deputy minister are less than 
convincing. 
  Mozambican society has a right to know what is really 
happening. If there are fundamental reasons for this situation, 
then let them out so that everything can return to normal. If 
there are no such reasons, then let the troops be ordered 
immediately to go into the assembly points. What must not 
happen is a continuation of this situation.

  [Excerpts] The head of state received two foreign 
emissaries today. Indeed, President Henry Konan Bedie received 
the Liberian and Malian foreign ministers this morning. Thomas 
Bahinchi has the details: 
  [Bahinchi] Gabriel Baccus Matthews, minister of foreign 
affairs of the Interim Government of National Salvation [title 
as heard] of Liberia, was accompanied to the head of state's 
house by Johnson Tiakwe, charge d'affaires of the Liberian 
Embassy in Cote d'Ivoire, and by Dukure Abdulai, President Amos 
Sawyer's director of francophone affairs. President Sawyer sent 
his foreign minister here to present his condolences to 
President Konan Bedie and to brief him on the evolution of the 
peace process in Liberia. 
  [Begin Matthews recording, in English fading into French 
translation] President Dr. Amos Sawyer, president of the Interim 
Government of National Unity, has sent me here to present his 
greetings to His Excellency President Konan Bedie. He also 
asked me to present to President Bedie his own condolences and 
those of the Liberian people to the people of Cote d'Ivoire for 
the immense and irreparable loss that the death of President 
Houphouet-Boigny has caused everyone, not only Cote d'Ivoire but 
the subregion and the international community. This is why I am 
here. 
  President Sawyer also asked me to brief President Konan 
Bedie 
on the situation in Liberia -- the evolution of the situation in 
Liberia. There are signs that things are not going on well, but 
in general -- looking at the general situation -- everything is 
going on well and we believe that peace will return to Liberia 
and we hope that in 1994 we will be able to hold free and 
democratic elections. [passage omitted] 
  In fact, it was President Houphouet-Boigny who laid the 
cornerstone of peace in Liberia. Thanks to him and thanks to 
the efforts he made in Yamoussoukro, we were able to make our 
present achievements. He always told us to go the school of 
patience. It was at his school of patience that we learned to 
be patient and to work assiduously. This is why we are saying 
that the groundwork and the foundation of peace in Liberia were 
achieved through the efforts of Houphouet-Boigny, and Liberians 
are very grateful to him for that. [end recording] 
  It was also to express the pain felt by the government and 
people of Mali following the death of President Houphouet-Boigny 
that the Malian head of state sent Ibrahim Boubakar Keita, 
Malian minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African 
integration, to President Konan Bedie. Before assuming this 
high government responsibility, Boubakar Keita was Mali's 
ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified reporter] 
You are responsible for African integration. After this 
devaluation we have just heard about, what solidarity effort 
should be made among African countries who have just been shown 
the need to count on themselves alone? 
  [Keita] You are perfectly right. This is a very pertinent 
question. I think that this issue is an outright challenge to 
us. It has come to remind us of our fundamental duties of 
solidarity and concern for one another. I think it was time for 
such a decision to be made regardless of the fact that it was 
done in such a painful manner. In fact, we have now become more 
conscious of the intimate solidarity of our interests hence the 
necessity to make sure that today, beyond all petty squbbles and 
all sentiments of restricted nationalism, we should pool our 
meager resources together for the adoption of a well-meaning 
policy of integration and well-deserved complementarity to 
enable our people to pass this difficult stage and to envisage 
the future with serenity. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The federal military government today explained that 
the setting up of the National Constitutional Conference 
Commission is borne out of its conviction that consensus can 
only be achieved in an atmosphere free of bitterness, hatred, 
bigotry, and fanaticism. Inaugurating the 19-member commission 
in Abuja, the head of state, General Sani Abacha, said his 
administration has unshakable commitment to the unity, 
stability, and peace of Nigeria. State House correspondent 
Chris Ngu reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ngu] The head of state, in his inaugural 
address, restated the commitment of his administration to the 
cause of unity, peace, and stability of the nation. In deciding 
on the need for the constitutional conference, Gen. Abacha said 
the administration is informed by a basic democratic norm which 
has it that what touches all must be approved by all. He said 
that Nigerians owe it as a duty to posterity to stand up with 
faith and good conscience in facing the challenges of nation 
building. Then he asked: What is nation building, after all, 
other than problem solving? The 19-member commission has Dr. 
(Saidu Kawu) as chairman. Gen. Abacha then stated the 
commission's terms of reference: 
  [Abacha] To prescribe modalities and organize a 
constitutional conference; b) [as heard] to invite memoranda 
from all parts of the country and from interest groups on the 
agenda of conference; c) to collate documents and compile 
memoranda for submission to the conference; d) to propose a 
reasonable and comprehensive time table for the conference; e) 
to advise on the number of delegates and members that will make 
up the conference; f) to recommend suitable modalities for 
electing and for selecting the delegations; and, finally, g) to 
advise on any other matters which the commission considers 
relevant to its assignment. 
  [Ngu] The head of state said that after a careful study of 
the national debate, even on the rather tense atmosphere of the 
nation's recent past, he is convinced that Nigerians still wish 
to live together in one country but under conditions of justice 
and fairness. The commission's chairman, Justice (Kawu), 
speaking on behalf of all the members, said that they were aware 
of the enormous task before the commission. He assured the head 
of state of the members' determination to successfully carry out 
their responsibility. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] A row has broken out today in the top ranks of 
Nigeria's Campaign for Democracy, the CD, the umbrella coalition 
of human rights groups which has been fighting for an end to 
military rule. CD Chairman Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti is reported to 
have been accused by the secretary general, Chima Ubani, of 
fraternizing with the military government. A number of radical 
civilian activists have been persuaded to join the Abacha 
administration since it took power last November. Prominent 
among them is Dr. Olu Onagoruwa, who is now minister of justice 
and attorney general. On the line to Lagos, Akwe Amosu asked 
Dr. Ransome-Kuti if he was aware of Mr. Ubani's allegations: 
  [Begin recording] [Ransome-Kuti] Well, not really but he has 
been.... [pauses] Maybe he has been behaving in a funny way for 
some time. But we have organizational ways of resolving things 
so I am quite comfortable. 
  [Amosu] But he says that you have been having secret 
meetings 
with the military and that you have compromised the 
organization. I mean that's rather specific, isn't it? 
  [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I don't know where he gets his evidence 
from or his advice, but we do talk to a lot of people and a lot 
of people do confront us and there is no way he can say we have 
compromised because we are still on the organizational stand. 
  [Amosu] I mean one of his pieces of evidence says that your 
own lawyer who stood by you through thick and thin, Mr. 
Onagoruwa, is now the justice minister and that your relations 
are so close that he is the main channel of communication 
between you and the government. 
  [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I don't know what he wants me to do 
about that. Maybe he wants me to exile myself or exile Mr. 
Onagoruwa. I don't know about that but Onagoruwa has many 
friends and he talks to a lot of people and sometimes he wants 
to know what CD thinks and he is told what CD thinks. I don't 
see what else one can do. One is not on an island and he can't 
isolate himself. 
  [Amosu] So, you would say that fraternizing with the 
government is an accusation that just won't stick. 
  [Ransome-Kuti] Well, it does not make sense. I mean 
everybody knows where we have stood for years and we still stand 
there. I mean he has just started so who is he to say somebody 
is compromising? What do we have to gain by compromising with a 
military government? Maybe he is showing youthful exuberance. 
Maybe he thinks things should go a different way than they are 
going but he does not know how organizations work. But on the 
other hand, we must say that CD has become quite a force in 
Nigeria and I won't be surprised if the government is trying to 
destabilize it internally because we are having a meeting now at 
this moment. If he had any problem, he should have raised it up 
at the meeting. We are having a convention in two weeks' time, 
so what is his problem? What can his problem be? 
  [Amosu] You seem to be accusing Mr. Ubani himself of being 
manipulated by the government. 
  [Ransome-Kuti] Not really. All I am saying is that if we 
have an internal fight and he feels so strongly, I am saying 
that we are having a meeting right now, which he knows about. 
Why does he not come and resolve it there? I mean when you 
have an internal fight in a organization, the secretary general 
goes out and makes a press release. 
  [Amosu] What about the other allegations that Mr. Ubani has 
made that collective leadership has broken down and that some 
officials are being kept in the dark about the state of the CD's 
finances? 
  [Ransome-Kuti] Well, he knows where to raise it. He knows 
where to raise it. The same point was raised by him a week ago 
and all the finances are audited and everything, so you know 
that is why I said it seems that he is trying to destabilize the 
organization because these are things which, if they were true, 
everybody would sympathize with him. 
  [Amosu] Whether this is a deliberate attempt to destabilize 
the CD or not, it is going to do you damage, isn't it? 
  [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I hope not because people know our 
reputation and we have been at it for some time and it is not at 
this stage that we are going to start collaborating with 
government. For what purpose? [end recording]

  [Excerpts] General Gnassingbe Eyadema, head of state, 
returned to Lome this evening from Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire's 
political capital, where he took part in the Entente Council 
[CE] heads of state meeting convened to pay last respects to 
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. He was welcomed on arrival at 
the airport by Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. [passage

prime minister at the VIP lounge but no statement was made to 
the press. We recall that the aircraft carrying the head of 
state touched down at the Lome Tokoin International Airport at 
exactly 1735 GMT. President Eyadema's trip to Cote d'Ivoire 
lasted only a few hours. It was a short but highly significant 
trip. The head of state and his peers of the CE went to express 
their condolences to the family of their late eldermost 
colleague. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 18 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] has dismissed three telephone calls to SAPA in 
which alleged PAC armed wing members denounced the 
organisation's decision to end the armed struggle. PAC Deputy 
President Johnson Mlambo said in a statement the names used by 
the callers were unknown to the PAC. He suggested "security 
agencies" were responsible for the calls, aimed at undermining 
the PAC. 
  PAC national organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanani told SAPA the 
code name Karl Zimbiri used by one caller was out of use within 
the organisation and that the original Mr Zimbiri had died. 
  The only three military commanders who were entitled to 
issue 
media statements on Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] 
operations were APLA Commander Sabelo Phama, APLA political 
commissar Romero Daniels and APLA information chief Johnny 
Majosi. 
  Mr Nemadzivhanani also denied there was dissent within 
APLA's 
ranks over the PAC's announced moratorium on violence. "APLA has 
always been a disciplined organ of the PAC. It has been led by 
the political leadership of the PAC at all times and APLA 
soldiers follow orders from the command structure of APLA." 
  He said the PAC and APLA commanders had not given any orders 
for APLA operations since the announcement of the moratorium. 
The leadership had no knowledge of involvement of APLA 
operatives in Sunday night's attack on a Durban satellite police 
station. 
  He alleged claims to the contrary were the work of "enemy 
agents" intent on discrediting the PAC in the run-up to the 
elections. "We have given all our commanders orders to instruct 
the cadres to cease fire under the moratorium to give our 
political leaders the chance to negotiate a mutual cessation of 
hostilities (with the government)." 
  While Mr Nemadzivhanani conceded the message might take some 
time to filter through to the rank-and-file membership, he 
insisted the proper command structures had been informed and the 
majority of members had been contacted. 
  Mr Nemadzivhanani said the PAC suspected government agents 
had infiltrated APLA with the intention of framing the 
organisation and discrediting it as a party committed to 
democracy. He alleged this had long been a calculated programme 
of the "regime" and the "rightwing".

  [Text] Angolan peace talks in Lusaka are reported to have 
made progress after the UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] movement gave way conditionally to the 
government's insistence that special anti-riot police forces 
should not be disbanded. 
  Diplomats said disagreement over the future of the police, 
especially the riot unit, had proved a stumbling block in the 
latest round of talks, which began in the Zambian capital in 
November. UNITA wanted the riot wing disbanded, arguing that it 
operated more like a military than a normal police force, and 
was serving to terrorize peole rather than keep the peace.

  [Text] The situation in Congo is extremely tense. Sporadic 
shooting from heavy artillery and bursts of automatic machinegun 
fire were heard this morning in the southern district of 
Brazzaville, especially at Bacongo and Makelekele districts, 
which have been sealed off for the past three days by government 
forces. Armored cars have been deployed at Makelekele district 
over the past three days in an attempt to prevent new clashes 
between the opposition coalition militia and government forces. 
These clashes have claimed about 75 lives in southern 
Brazzaville since mid- December. 
  The cordoning off of Bacongo is the result of the kidnapping 
of Lieutenant Jonathan Mabiala, an officer of the presidential 
security, who has still not been found. The presidential 
security has accused the private militia of opposition leader 
Bernard Kolelas of carrying out the kidnapping. The opposition 
has denied any involvement in this affair. 
  Meanwhile, about 100 armed supporters of the presidential 
group gathered around the seat of the ruling party, the 
Pan-African Union for Social Democracy this morning. They are 
demanding their integration into the Army. According to 
witnesses, the police did not intervene.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 20 (AFP) -- A rocket attack damaged 
a police station Thursday [20 January] in the northern Ouenze 
area of Brazzaville, which has been rocked by fighting among 
government supporters, troops and opposition militias. 
  A second rocket attack blew out the windows of a bank in the 
same district, witnesses said. No casualties were reported from 
the attacks and it was unclear who was responsible. 
  In December, a policeman was killed when unidentified gunmen 
opened fire on another police station in the Ouenze district, 
which had hitherto been spared the violence raging largely in 
the south of the Congolese capital. 
  In another incident, a group of opposition militiamen on 
Thursday attacked a street market in the southwestern M'filou 
area, but nobody was hurt, witnesses said. 
  The militia was protesting against the sealing off by 
government troops and presidential guards of Makele-kele and the 
Bacongo district, an opposition stronghold in the south, 
following the disappearance at the weekend of presidential guard 
lieutenant, Jonathan Mabiala. 
  Small arms fire overnight in both these districts was due to 
clashes between militiamen backing President Pascal Lissouba and 
armed opposition forces, a military source said. 
  The guard has accused the private militia of opposition 
leader Bernard Kolelas of seizing Mabiala, but the opposition 
has denied any part in the affair. 
  Since mid-December, clashes in Brazzaville following 
contested elections have left some 115 people dead in the south 
of the city.

<F P=106> [By Mario Fiorito] </F>
  [Text] Kinshasa, Jan 19 (AFP) -- The home of Etienne 
Tshisekedi, arch-foe of Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, was 
surrounded by troops Wednesday [19 January] as a strike called 
by opponents of the regime won wide support, an opposition 
spokesman said. 
  Troops surrounded and sealed off Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home 
early in the morning according to his close advisor and former 
Tshisekedi government communications minister, Lambert Mende. 
  Kinshasha streets were deserted Wednesday morning in answer 
to an appeal from Tshisekedi for a strike to protest Marshal 
Mobuto's dissolution of rival parliaments. 
  Frequent gunfights in the capital overnight also helped 
clear markets and close shops. However, the volatile 
working-class districts of the city were reported quiet 
Wednesday morning. 
  Tshisekedi has been in a year-long stand-off with Mobuto 
following his refusal to step down as prime minister when the 
president dismissed him in October 1992, dissolving his whole 
government in February 1993. 
  Tshisekedi was foisted as premier on the reluctant Mobuto by 
a national conference that began its work, often interrupted by 
political strife and bloodshed, in 1991. 
  The latest conflict was sparked by Mobuto's declaration last 
week that the signing of a political agreement between his own 
Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) movement and the radical 
Holy Alliance opposition coalition entailed the dissolution of 
the country's rival parliaments. 
  The High Council of the Republic (HCR), appointed by the 
national conference in 1992, and the National Assembly, 
comprising members of the former sole, ruling People's Movement 
of the Revolution (MPR), both claim legislative authority. 
  Mobutu called for a meeting Wednesday among members of the 
rival bodies, which he wanted grouped in a new high council, to 
consider a new constitution and the premiership of the large, 
impoverished central African nation of more than 38 million 
people. 
  The HCR, however, has refused to accept Mobutu's position, 
as 
it refused to accept the authority of Faustin Birindwa, the 
prime minister he appointed after dismissing Tshisekedi for a 
second time in two years in October 1992. 
  The HCR has been summoned into session around midday 
Thursday 
by its vice-president, Joseph Ileo, a member of Tshisekedi's 
Christian Democrat and Social Party (PDSC), who stated that the 
HCR would not attend the meeting proposed by Mobutu. 
  The HCR president, Archbishop of Kisingani Laurent Mosengwo 
Pasinya, had called for a meeting of the council as soon as 
possible to discuss forming a single body with the national 
assembly. 
  Mobuto's 29-year-old regime is showing increasing signs of 
falling apart with mounting reluctance of his main backers, 
former colonial power Belgium, France, and the United States to 
support him.

  [Text] Sparks have been going off in Zaire since this 
morning. Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's ghost city campaign seems to 
doing very well in Kinshasa. No one bothered to go to work on 
the morning of 19 January. Things have been flaring up around 
the transitional prime minister's residence, which was 
surrounded by the Presidential Guard at daybreak. Several Union 
for Democracy and Social Progress -- Tshisekedi's party -- 
activists immediately responded to defend their leader. Here 
is an account by Djouko Moulopo, the charge d'affaires of the 
permanent representation of Tshisekedi's government in Brussels. 
  [Begin Moulopo recording] The ghost city campaign launched 
by the opposition in protest against President Mobutu's illegal 
and anti constitutional acts has been followed totally by the 
population. At the moment, we fear for the prime minister's 
life because we have been informed from Kinshasa that the prime 
minister's residence has been totally surrounded by the (?DSP) 
and the (?ZARM) [expansion unknown]. Combatants are protecting 
the prime minister and exchanging fire with the soldiers. This 
is the situation as it stands in Kinshasa. Army troops are 
positioned at strategic points. [end recording] 
  This renewed tension jeopardizes the 19 January meeting 
convened by President Mobutu between the High Council of the 
Republic and the National Assembly, which should lead to the 
merger of the two organs and the election of a new prime 
minister. The choice is between Mr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Mulumba 
Lukoji. As Djouko Moulopo points out in no uncertain terms, the 
radical opposition is not at all happy about this: 
  [Begin Moulopo recording] President Mobutu has no right or 
freedom to convene the High Council of Republic. If he had 
convened his former assembly, we would understand that, but 
Monsignor Monsengwo has declared that he did not have to fall in 
line with President Mobutu's position, because it is an anti 
constitutional act, which is not laid down in the transitional 
act on the provisions for the new constitution in Zaire. 
Therefore in our view, there is no High Council of the Republic 
in Zaire today. [end recording]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 19 Jan (AFP) -- Zairian security forces 
have now withdrawn from around the home of opposition leader 
Etienne Tshisekedi after sealing off his residence during 
Wednesday morning, one of his close aides said. There has been 
no official explanation of why the troops surrounded 
Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home but the move appeared to be linked to 
a strike on Wednesday called by him to protest the dissolution 
last week by President Mobutu Sese Seko of the country's rival 
legislatures. Shops and most offices stayed closed and the 
capital's streets were virtually empty of traffic all day.

  [Excerpt] Slowly but surely the democracy bandwagon 
continues on course. All those who delay in joining it or who 
fail to join will be left behind. In accordance with President 
Mobutu's decree, endorsing the wish expressed by the political 
class during the Palais du Peuple consultations, an 
extraordinary session of the High Council of the Republic, 
Transitional Parliament, was officially opened at 1600 at the 
Palais du Peuple today. The first session was devoted to the 
registration of the members and the management of the new 
Parliament. It must be pointed out that the political class' 
decision to have Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo chair the High 
Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament -- beginning 
from the next session -- was unanimously approved. Proceedings 
are to resume at 1500 at the Palais du Peuple on 20 January. 
All members of the High Council, Transitional Parliament are 
requested to attend the meeting. Toum Bamba Toulou has just 
arrived from the Palais du Peuple and gives us further details: 
  [Begin Toulou recording] The atmosphere at the Palais du 
Peuple was good. Mr. Moulenda Loutoula, parliamentary secretary 
general, chaired the inaugural session of the High Council of 
the Republic, Transitional Parliament. There were almost 400 
members from the defunct National Assembly, the defunct High 
Council of the Transition, which was set up following the 
Sovereign National Conference. Negotiators from the two 
political groups -- the Political Forces of the Conclave, as 
well as the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allied 
Groups -- who worked arduously to obtain the protocol agreement 
which will govern the transitional period, were also present. 
  There are three items on the agenda of this extraordinary 
session, which should not exceed 15 days. As of tomorrow, the 
session will be chaired by Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of High 
Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament in accordance 
with the spirit of the accord. First, there will be the 
internal organization of the Parliament, that is, the 
examination and ratification of the mandate of the members, then 
the drawing up and adoption of internal regulations, the 
election of the final executive bureau, and the setting up of 
working commissions. The honorable councillors will also set up 
and adopt the constitutional act for the transitional period. 
The last item will be the election of the person who will head 
the final transitional government. All the items on the agenda 
are important, but the one concerning the election of the prime 
minister is very delicate. This is why we are repeating our 
call that there must be good will, clearheadedness, and moral 
and intellectual sincerity from all sides so that a judicious 
and conscientious choice for the prime minister will be made.

  [Text] After the decision by the political class to set up 
a single chamber parliament based on the head of state's 
decision to allow the political class to reach a consensus on 
ending the dual parliamentarian institutions as well as other 
institutions of the Republic, the former High Council of the 
Republic [HCR] established by the Sovereign National Conference, 
has just agreed to endorse this new institution that will 
include all former deputies, former HCR members, and former 
advisors. During a special HCR session at the People's Palace, 
which was attended by 368 members, 223 voted for the decision 
while 80 voted against and 60 abstained. 
  As we can see, the political will expressed during the 
negotiations has finally prevailed and each participant has 
expressed his accord in line with his own views, sometimes with 
different words or different procedures. The main thing, 
however, is that the people have now understood and that the 
entire political class is driven by a single ideal, that of 
putting an end to dual Republican institutions, which is a happy 
prelude to fair and free elections.

  [Text] The members of the Alliance of Independent Forces 
for Radical Change [AFICR] platform met on 17 January under the 
chairmanship of Mr. Bonaventure Muanateba to examine the latest 
message to the nation by the head of state. In this regard, 
Muanateba's AFICR reaffirmed and supported the appointment of a 
prime minister without political leanings. 
  For its part, the Active Forces of AFICR [FAAFICR], who also 
met on 17 January, support the candidacy of Professor Mulumba 
Lukoji to the office of prime minister. In addition, 
nationalists, parliamentarians, counselors to the republic, 
party leaders, and associations from civil society have decided 
to support Professor Mulumba Lukoji's candidacy. 
  On this issue, we have also received the reaction of the 
Young Mobutists Front [FROJEMO] on the present political 
situation. Here is our report: 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified spokesman] Members of 
the AFICR platform met today, Monday 17 January, under the 
chairmanship of Bonaventure Muanateba Tomuningo Mushinua, 
chairman, to examine the head of state's latest message to the 
nation. After the meeting, the following steps were taken: 
  1. On the question of candidates for the post of prime 
minister, AFICR notes with regret that the present approach by 
the head of state consisting in presenting two candidates, 
Tshisekedi wa Mulumba and Mulumba Lukoji, who come from the same 
region and belong to the same tribe, could bring us back to the 
situation experienced in 1965 between Prime Ministers Tsombe and 
Kimba, both from Katanga. It therefore reaffirms and supports 
the appointment of a prime minister without political leanings. 
  2. On the question of representation in the High Council of 
the Republic [HCR], the interim parliament, the AFICR condemns 
the bi- polarization which excludes (?the forces) already on the 
country's political arena. As a center platform, it demands its 
80 seats in the HCR in order to get involved with the others -- 
including Antoine Gisenga's UFONAL [expansion unknown] -- in 
working out mechanisms for running the country. 
  3. On the dissolution of parliament and the HCR, the AFICR 
deplores the attitude of certain political leaders who view and 
describe the ordinance dissolving the parliament -- i.e. the HCR 
-- and convening at the same time the extraordinary session of 
the HCR, interim parliament, as a coup d'etat, whereas all that 
the head of state did was to apply the will of the negotiators. 
  4. Concerning Monsignor Monsengwo, the AFICR advises the 
Catholic prelate to take advantage of this opportunity to leave 
the political scene and leave politics to politicians. 
  5. On the wave of illegal occupation of government houses, 
the AFICR demands that such occupants be convicted and that the 
Zairian state retrieve these houses without further delay. 
  6. Lastly, the AFICR reminds everyone in the national and 
international community that there is only a one and indivisible 
AFICR, in compliance with Article 9 of the Charter, led by Mr. 
Bonaventure Muanateba, its presidium chairman. 
  [Second unidentified spokesman] [Words indistinct] Professor 
Mulumba Lukoji as candidate for the post of prime minister. We 
nationalists, parliamentarians, counselors to the republic, 
negotiators, leaders of political parties and associations in 
civil society, met today on the eve of the first session of the 
HCR -- interim parliament -- to examine the situation prevailing 
in the country. 
  Considering the head of state's two messages to the nation, 
to which we fully subscribe; 
  Considering that after the second message of 14 January more 
than half of the negotiators signed the so-called People's 
Palace accords, thereby approving the scheme recommended by 
these accords as a means of ending the crisis our country is 
passing through; 
  Considering that the implementation of these accords implies 
the setting up of a representative government of national unity, 
headed by a politically neutral, unifying, and nationalist prime 
minister who will steer a conflict-free transition; 
  Have, in the light of the foregoing, decided to give our 
full 
and unreserved support to the candidacy of Prof. Mulumba Lukoji 
for the post of prime minister. 
  [Third unidentified spokesman] The FAAFICR met this Monday, 
16 [as heard] January, at their usual headquarters to consider 
the speech delivered by the president on Friday, 14 January, at 
2000. At the end of this important meeting, the following 
decisions were made: 
  1. The FAAFICR recalls for the benefit of the national and 
international community its communique of 5 January demanding a 
unifying prime minister who is not known to have championed the 
cause of politics of exclusion and who is accepted by all 
regions so as to avoid a splitting of Zaire into several states. 
  2. The FAAFICR is unable to understand the position of the 
radical opposition when, in a letter dated 12 January, it 
presents the candidacy of Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi, seeking his 
appointment to the post of prime minister by an ordinance of the 
head of state, whereas all along Mr. Tshisekedi has been the 
only legally recognized prime minister appointed by the 
sovereign national conference. If that is the case, why seek a 
fresh appointment by presidential decree? One then understands 
someone is poking fun at our people -- and this is very 
dangerous for the future of our country. 
  3. Lastly, the FAAFICR supports Prof. Mulumba Lukoji's 
candidacy to the post of prime minister. In his case, at least, 
even though he hails from Kasai Oriental, he is accepted by his 
people -- first, by Katanga and then by the other regions as a 
whole -- and Zaire can bank on him. 
  [Fourth unidentified spokesman] We, youngsters of FROJEMO, 
thank the head of state and the entire political class for the 
efforts they are making at the moment to get the country out of 
the predicament in which we find ourselves. The people count on 
them and we believe today's meeting will be an important one and 
will be marked in letters of gold in the history of our country. 
So we will not talk much. We sincerely wish them a successful 
meeting in order that Zaire may live long. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin by Sayyid </F>
Ahmad Khalifah in Jeddah; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khalifah] What are the aims and results of your 
current visit to Saudi Arabia and how do you view the 
development of relations between the two countries? 
  [Seyoum] Our relations with the Saudi Kingdom are old, 
advanced, and based on goodneighborliness and mutual respect. 
We seek to strengthen and develop them further through exchange 
of visits and contacts. 
  On this visit we have focused on political, trade, and 
economic ties and on the various Saudi sectors benefiting from 
the trade and investment atmosphere in Ethiopia, which now has a 
free economy in the full sense of the word. 
  [Khalifah] Has your country achieved the necessary stability 
that would encourage investment? What were the circumstances 
relating to the question of the opposition conference and the 
arrests which followed? 
  [Seyoum] Ethiopia is a democratic country in the full sense 
of the word. We have about 100 political parties and 
organizations. They all exercise their rights freely in 
accordance with the national charter which recognizes the full 
rights of the Ethiopian people and nationalities. There are 
dozens of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals which are free 
to publish what they like. 
  That democratic thrust does not worry anyone. Quite the 
contrary, there have been positive developments throughout the 
country, especially in the economic and security fields. 
  What happened recently, however, was that some groups called 
for armed action against the state and the public on the pretext 
of making political gains which can be achieved through open 
democratic activity for all. Some opposition parties have held 
a conference attended by some expatriates. Although thousands 
attended that conference and opposed the government and its 
programs, the government's view was that that was their right, 
but some of those who came from abroad to attend the conference 
openly called for and expressed their belief in armed action to 
fulfill their political convictions. It is the government's 
duty to prevent such action, which would be a threat to peace 
and security in a country that has historically suffered the 
calamities of futile and unjustified internal and external wars. 
  In discharging our duties as a government we arrested seven 
of these warmongers. Two of them have since been released. The 
other five will stand trial. 
  [Khalifah] You have postponed the parliamentary and 
presidential elections several times. Has a final date been set 
for that? 
  [Seyoum] The elections were postponed because of known 
compelling reasons related to the strengthening of democracy in 
a country that is experiencing democracy for the first time 
ever. It has been decided to hold the elections next June. 
Then the permanent constitution will be drawn up. It will be 
the first in the history of Ethiopia's pluralistic rule. 
  [Khalifah] Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki has spoken of 
difficulties in his country's relations with Sudan. How would 
you describe your country's relations with Sudan? Are there 
difficulties there too? 
  [Seyour] We have, over the past two and a half years, been 
trying hard to normalize relations with Sudan and we will 
continue to do so despite some problems with these relations. 
Unless these problems are solved, we expect more difficulties 
and they would become public as in the case of Eritrean-Sudanese 
relations. 
  [Khalifah] What is the nature of your problems with Sudan? 
  [Seyoum] The same kind of problems Afewerki spoke about when 
addressing his relations with Sudan, which supports religious 
groups to undermine security and stability in the neighboring 
countries, and we are one of these countries. We would, of 
course, like Sudan to think hard before extending these 
practices to the neighboring countries. We can live with Sudan 
and others in peace only when each side keeps its convictions, 
views, and ideologies within its own borders. 
  [Khalifah] Has the Eritrean Government given you the details 
of its problems with Sudan before or after recent developments? 
  [Seyoum] Exporting trouble to Eritrea or any state bordering 
on Sudan would certainly affect us and we should of necessity 
have knowledge of its details and developments. In our 
relations with Sudan we are also suffering, the same as Eritrea. 
So long as Sudan pursues these policies in Eritrea it would 
naturally pursue them in our country. Despite all that, we do 
not believe that this situation has asssumed major proportions 
but we want it to end in the interests of both countries. We 
are discussing these matters with Sudan with complete frankness 
and clarity in order to iron out these problems. 
  [Khalifah] Have your ties with the Western states suffered 
as a result of your relations with Sudan when they were good? 
  [Seyoumr] We have always discussed with the West our 
relations with Sudan, and we have always sought to contribute to 
the normalization of relations between Sudan and others. Sudan 
has no other option. 
  As regards the West's contribution to our country's economy, 
we are fully satisfied with Western and U.S. aid and are trying 
to use that aid in rebuilding our country, which was devastated 
by internal and external problems and wars that are now things 
of the past and will not be repeated. 
  [Khalifah] Have all the Ethiopian refugees returned to their 
country? 
  [Seyoum] We are working with the United Nations for the 
voluntary return of all the Ethiopian refugees. About 13,000 of 
them returned from Sudan last year and large numbers returned 
from Kenya and Djibouti. We seek to support the returnees and 
encourage the return of the others. 
  [Khalifah] Is your country continuing its efforts to solve 
the Somali problem, having failed in its latest efforts to 
achieve that objective? 
  [Seyoum] Although we cannot do for Somalia more than we have 
done and are doing, we are definitely interested in Somalia's 
security and stability because there are about 1 million 
Ethiopian Somalis and about half a million Somali refugees in 
our country. That is why an effective solution for the Somali 
problem would very much interest us, not least because of its 
importance for the security and stability of our country and the 
region and for the preservation of its resources.

  [Text] The Ethiopian transitional government's foreign 
minister has noted that, although we do not oppose the Sudanese 
Government's ideology, which it is implementing in its country 
and believes will assist its country, the expansion of its 
ideology to neighboring countries should be stopped -- because 
it concerns us as well. 
  Mr. Mesfin Seyoum, in a statement to the Saudi Arabian ARAB 
NEWS newspaper, said that Sudan should think twice before 
deciding to expand its ideology to neighboring countries, and 
noted that we may understand each other if Sudan is limited to 
implementing its ideology on its territory only. 
  The foreign minister went on to say that trying to expand 
ideology in a way which would affect the peace and stability of 
neighboring countries would affect the countries concerned. Mr. 
Mesfin, answering a question on how he views the conflict which 
arose between Eritrea and Sudan, said anything which affects the 
peace and stability of neighboring countries will concern us, 
because it will also affect our peace and stability. Mr. Mesfin 
noted however that open and clear discussions were underway 
between the two countries.

  [Text] Osman Hassan Ali, alias Osman Ato, Professor 
Mohamed Hassan Awaleh, and Omar Salad Ilmi held a press 
conference this morning at the United Somali Congress [USC] 
headquarters, Mogadishu, in which they spoke about their illegal 
detention in a UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] jail, in addition 
to other problems they had recently encountered. The honorables 
gave an account of how they were kidnapped from their homes on 
21 September and 3 October 1993 and how they had been treated 
until their release on 10 January 1994. 
  The honorables started by saying that for the first 24 hours 
of their kidnapping they had been handcuffed, no food had been 
provided to them, and water was in very short supply. Shortly 
afterwards, they were taken to an island off the coast of 
Kismaayo, which was barely fit for human habitation, as the 
temperature was 40 degrees Celsius during the daytime and very 
cold at night. 
  The honorables went on to say that in disrespect to their 
religion UNOSOM sometimes added pork to their meals -- but they 
threw it away. They said after some time they fell ill in 
detention and their request for treatment fell on deaf ears, 
resulting in a deterioration in their health. They also stated 
that they were subjected to terrible noises coming from jet 
fighters and helicopters, with the aim of terrorizing them. The 
citizens also said that the reason for their being taken to 
Baidoa was to attempt to prove that they were the ones 
responsible for all acts against UNOSOM troops.

  [Excerpt] Osman Hassan Ali, alias Osman Ato, a member of 
the United Somali Congress [USC] central committee, speaking on 
behalf of the eight citizens detained by UN Operation Somalia 
[UNOSOM] after being illegally kidnapped from their homes, today 
addressed thousands of jovial people at 1 July Independence 
Square. The demonstrators carried placards and the flag of the 
Republic of Somalia, and chanted: "Down with Somalia's enemies" 
"UNOSOM leave Somalia", "may the agreement to unite Somalia 
succeed" and other slogans. 
  The rally was first addressed by Awil Ahmad Abdi, from the 
Somali Democratic Movement and Mohamed Ahmad Nur, the USC 
secretary for reconstruction and rehabilitation, who greeted and 
congratulated the Somali citizens that UNOSOM had illegally 
kidnapped from their homes. They also congratulated the Somali 
National Alliance supporters, particularly those from Mogadishu 
and its surrounding environs, who had been holding non-stop 
demonstrations which, they said, finally forced UNOSOM to 
release the officials they had illegally detained. 
  Speaking on behalf of the eight citizens, Osman Hassan Ali 
thanked the Somali people and said that history would not forget 
those people involved in the struggle against the UNOSOM troops. 
Osman Hassan Ali said that they had done something which had 
been lacking in Somalia and the African continent, and that this 
had sent a clear signal to foreigners that they could not do 
whatever they wished to an independent country and people. 
Referring to the agreement reached between brother Somalis and 
signed at the Kah Hotel in Mogadishu, he said he strongly 
supported it, pointing out that the agreement was the key for 
peace and stability to come about in Somalia. In conclusion, he 
appealed to the Somali people to show tolerance, fortitude, and 
mutual respect for each other's rights. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 20 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk 
on Thursday [20 January] made a tacit plea to white urban local 
authorities to contribute in redressing the decades-long neglect 
and abuse of black municipal services. Speaking at the local 
government conference at the World Trade Centre outside 
Johannesburg, Mr de Klerk said the end of township rent and 
services boycotts would help pay the R[rand]1.8 billion township 
services debt. It would also impact enormously on the cash flow 
of local authorities. "But it is a matter of debate whether 
that will be enough to redress the legacy of the past. I do not 
think so." 
  It was accepted that the financing and implementation of 
upgrading local services would require regional and national 
support. Something more would be needed, however, and many 
local authorities would be in a position to make substantial 
contributions. "For the sake of peace and stability I believe 
they should do so."

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson 
Mandela and State President F. W. de Klerk have signed an 
agreement marking the restoration of legitimate local 
government. After addressing the local government summit at the 
World Trade Center outside Johannesburg, the two leaders and the 
2,200 delegates were presented with an agreement on finance, 
services, and service rendering. 
  The agreement recognizes the recently promulgated Local 
Government Transitional Act and commits signatories to promote 
and expedite the normalization of local government. It says the 
summit marks the start of restoring legitimacy and credibility 
to local government finance, services, and service rendering in 
particular. 
  Meanwhile, earlier in the day Mandela called for an end to 
the rent and services boycott.

  [Text] Potchefstroom Jan 20 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk 
embarked on his Western Transvaal electoral road show on 
Thursday and it went smoothly barring a reported stone-throwing 
incident in a Fochville township. Presidential aides said they 
had received reports that a small group of blacks pelted a 
larger group of National Party [NP] supporters in Kokosi 
township. A NP media bus scheduled to stop there was diverted to 
Potchefstroom where Mr de Klerk addressed two meetings. 
  No immediate comment could be obtained from Western 
Transvaal 
police and NP aides said they had no further information. 
  Mr de Klerk was received warmly by an audience of mostly 
first-year students at the University of Potchefstroom, and 
applauded when he addressed a meeting of NP organisers in the 
town's banquet hall. The president's Western Transvaal tour, 
amid tight security, will continue to Saturday. He was scheduled 
to make three stops in Klerksdorp and visit a Ventersdorp farm 
on Friday. 
  Mr de Klerk told the Potchefstroom students to forget polls 
which showed 70 per cent support for the African National 
Congress, [ANC] saying the NP's own surveys showed the party 
could win the election if it could garner the support of 
undecided voters. 
  A small section of the students hissed briefly when he 
started his address. 
  Mr de Klerk said the NP did not have self defence units as 
did the ANC and which ran wild and intimidated the public. At 
the banquet hall, he called on np organisers to alert the NP to 
cases of intimidation so that guilty parties could be charged.

they're a reality, they're strong, they have substantial 
support, but there is only one party which can cut them down to 
size -- and they need to be cut down to size -- and that is the 
National Party. [end recording] 
  From the University Mr. de Klerk went to a meeting of 
National Party organizers at the Potchefstroom Hall. The road 
show continues this morning with meetings at Klerksdorp and 
Rustenburg.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 20 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela warned on Thursday [20 
January] South Africa was faced with a civil war as in Angola 
and Mozambique and a solution should be found to Afrikaners' 
demand for a separate state. "We are not going to accept this 
demand, but we are prepared to discuss with you a solution. I 
would like you to support this to save our country from 
unnecessary bloodshed. We must try and avoid that," he told a 
"people's forum" at the SA Broadcasting Corporation's 
Johannesburg head office, called to address broadcast employees' 
concerns. 
  As opinion polls predicted a landslide victory by the ANC in 
the April 27 election, the ANC president acknowledged the 
ability of the ultra-rightwing to derail a future government. 
He said the ultra- right had significant support in the public 
service, army, police and sympathisers in important and 
strategic installations. "They can derail any democratic 
government in this country," he said, but added: "It does not 
mean that we are cowards. We will deal with that." 
  South Africa was facing the Angolan and Mozambican scenario, 
where civil wars that began at independence had raged for at 
least 16 years, Mr Mandela told scores of SABC employees. "We 
are facing that situation," Mr Mandela said about the two 
countries where warring sides are now seeking a negotiated 
settlement. 
  While signalling further concessions to the rightwing groups 
pressing for a separate state, the ANC leader said it was ironic 
their demand was surfacing on the brink of black majority rule. 
"All the time they were happy to rule us. Now that the 
challenge is from blacks, they want a separate state. We will 
not concede," he said. 
  Without actually mentioned the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], 
Mr Mandela said blacks boycotting the elections were scared of 
democracy and were hankering for white minority rule. "What 
they are saying is that: 'We don't want liberation, we don't 
want to be free. We want to continue to be under the rule of 
the white minority,'" he said. The IFP Central Committee has 
announced the party will not contest the election until its 
demand for self- determination is granted. A national 
conference later this month will take a final decision. 
  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen said on Wednesday "limited violence" could be used to 
support the demand for an Afrikaner state and King Goodwill 
Zwelithini said on Monday Zulus would resist threats to the Zulu 
nation posed by the new constitution. 
  Reacting to questions on affirmative action in the SABC, Mr 
Mandela said the ANC would redress the situation where currently 
75 percent of staff at the corporation were whites. "This is a 
situation we can't tolerate. The problem of affirmative action 
is one we must undertake. To fail to do so will be a betrayal 
to all our predecessors who have sacrificed in order to ensure 
that the day of liberation should come." 
  But Mr Mandela also expressed concern about white skilled 
staff leaving because of the changing situation in the country. 
"You must remain and fight with us," he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg SAPA 20 Jan -- The right wing was 
looking for trouble which would trigger even higher levels of 
violence if it persisted with separatist demands, African 
National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela said on 
Thursday night [20 January]. He was speaking at a Black Lawyers 
Association function in Johannesburg. 
  He said the right wing posed a far more serious threat in 
South Africa than the likes of (UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] leader) Jonas Savimbi posed in 
Angola. "We are facing even more violence than that which is 
raging now," Mr Mandela said. He said the ANC was not bothered 
by the right's black surrogate forces, which he did not 
identify. "But the ultra-right is powerful in the proper sense 
of the word. They are trained and experienced and they know the 
country better than we do. They are likely to create havoc," Mr 
Mandela said. 
  To illustrate the right wing's destructive capacity, Mr 
Mandela said the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of 
the Nation], in spite of its small size and inexperience, had 
been able to strike at will. 
  He said the ANC had made it clear there was no question of 
it 
accepting a separate "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] and that 
it would be suicide for the ANC to accept an ethnic solution. 
  Rightist demands presented a challenge which black lawyers 
would have to contribute to sorting out. 
  Earlier, Mr Mandela said constitutional democracy was 
incompatible with continued white domination of the economy. 
Paraphrasing former South African Prime Minister John Vorster, 
Mr Mandela said the implications of continued white domination 
were "too ghastly to contemplate". 
  At a second function on Thursday night, this time at 
Investec 
at which the company announced plans to help establish a 
business school at the University of the North, Mr Mandela said 
the exclusion of the black majority from mainstream economic 
life was a major ANC concern. "Up until now black business 
persons have been restricted to the role of taxi owners, 
shebeeners, tuckshop owners and the like. Notwithstanding, they 
have performed with remarkable aplomb. We can no longer be 
content with that limited role," Mr Mandela said.

  [Text] The Ministry of Defense has confirmed that Minister 
Kobie Coetsee is engaged in talks with a PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress] delegation in Pretoria. Earlier the PAC said that 
members of its Executive Committee, including Mr. Benny 
Alexander and Mr. Barney Desai, were to have talks with the 
government today. The talks follow the PAC's announcement that 
it has suspended its armed struggle. The agenda for today's 
talks is expected to include possible amnesty for APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army -- PAC military wing] members, joint 
command of the security forces, and PAC participation in the 
Transitional Executive Council.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 20 SAPA -- Progress was reportedly made 
in Pretoria on Thursday to bring the Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] back into the transition process. In talks, the government 
and the PAC agreed to establish three working committees to meet 
as early as next week to take further Thursday's "exploratory 
meeting". 
  A possible first meeting between President F W de Klerk and 
PAC leader Clarence Makwetu was also raised "and may be taken 
further", a government spokesman said afterwards. 
  The two sides met for two hours at the offices of government 
chief negotiator Roelf Meyer. The issues discussed were: 
  -- whether there should be one or two ballot papers on April 
27. The PAC, like the Freedom Alliance, wants one for the 
national government and one for the provincial government; 
  -- amnesty for members of the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian 
Peoples Liberation Army, in the wake of the PAC's suspension of 
its armed struggle; 
  -- the PAC's participation in the Transitional Executive 
Council. The PAC announced it would join the body only if there 
was joint control over all the country's armed forces; and 
  -- the PAC's participation on the executive council 
sub-council on defence. Some executive council participants have 
argued that PAC representation on the sub-council would meet its 
demand for proper joint control over the armed forces. 
  The government's Departments of Defence, Justice and 
Constitutional Development will together with PAC representation 
form the three working committees. "The most important thing we 
want to discuss with government is the question of one ballot or 
two ballots," PAC negotiator Gora Ebrahim told SAPA. 
  The PAC had consistently favoured two ballots, he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 21 SAPA -- Five people were killed 
and nine wounded when gunmen armed with AK-47 rifles opened fire 
on a minibus taxi at 5.30am in Vosloorus on Friday morning, 
police said. The taxi filled with commuters was driving slowly 
along MC Drive in the East Rand township when the gunmen 
ambushed it. 
  East Rand police spkokesman Lt Deon Peens told SAPA three 
men 
and two women died inside the vehicle as other commuters fled 
the scene. The gunmen kept firing at the fleeing passengers and 
several bullets hit the walls and windows of a nearby shopping 
centre. 
  The blood-splattered taxi was still standing at the roadside 
by 9am on Friday. Glass was scattered on the scene. 
  Inside the minibus gym bags, video cassettes and 
blood-spattered shoes were scattered across the floor and seats. 
The area around the scene was cordoned off by members of the 
police Internal Stability Unit. 
  Lt Peens said more than 50 AK-47 catridges had been found on 
the scene. Markers were placed around the spent catridges. 
  The township was tense on Friday morning and residents 
appeared stunned by the shooting after a week of relative calm.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN 
  PAC Gains Township Youth Support -- "Coinciding with the 
announcement of the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] decision to 
suspend the armed struggle has been the disclosure by a Sunday 
newspaper of an election poll in which the ANC [African National 
Congress] would get 64.4 percent of the vote to the PAC's 1.7 
percent, with half of the ANC's Black supporters listing the PAC 
as their second choice," notes the page 6 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 17 January. The PAC has 
gained the image, "particularly among radicalised township 
youth, as hard-nosed, more extreme and more aggressive than the 
ANC in recent times, particularly with its One settler, one 
bullet slogan. Abandoning attacks on White farmers and other 
civilian targets may make the PAC look like any other former 
liberation organisation." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  IFP Backing 'Lagging By Miles' -- Referring to Zulu King 
Zwelithini's meeting with President de Klerk, Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 19 January in a page 12 editorial says: 
"What is not clear is how far the king's concern with the Zulu 
monarchy and the 'kingdom of kwaZulu' reflects historical 
tradition as opposed to ambition and political affiliation 
(although he would deny the latter). By saying this we do not 
wish to pooh-pooh a lineage of kings which has stamped itself 
indelibly on our history, nor do we doubt that 
self-determination and the question of a double ballot are 
crucially important to many people." "Unfortunately the king 
resorted to a threat of resistance and indulged in rhetoric 
which is simply not supported by fact. Opinion polls suggest 
that backing for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] (and 
maintaining kwaZulu) is lagging by miles. They fail to 
substantiate the king's assertion that 'expunging the very name 
of my kingdom from the Constitution...has sent shock waves 
throughout the psyche of every one of our Zulu subjects'." THE 
STAR is glad discussions will continue, "but they need to be 
less emotively based." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Inkatha, White Right Avoid Feasible Settlement -- "There are 
good grounds for believing that neither Inkatha nor the white 
right wing is seriously seeking a feasible settlement," states a 
page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 19 
January. "A pattern is becoming apparent that, as soon as 
concessions are made, new demands arise. Nevertheless, the NP 
[National Party], the ANC and others involve in the next phase 
of talks with the Freedom Alliance, starting today, must not 
allow their scepticism to detract from good faith negotiations." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  De Klerk 'Forced To Show Sympathy' for Zulu Constituency -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 19 January in a page 6 
editorial comments on the meeting between Zulu King Zwelithini 
and State President de Klerk in Pretoria, saying Zwelithini "is 
being manipulated by the politicians to do things that are 
unbecoming to a monarch." "For Chief Buthelezi this was a 
shrewd political move, made even more impressive by the concern 
expressed at acts of intimidation and the wanton killing of 
people. It was astute of him to play the role of loyal subject 
for the support he got was impressive even if it was mainly 
bused in. Buthelezi knows President de Klerk and the Government 
are forced to show sympathy to his and King Zwelithini's 
constituency. The bland political outcome, notwithstanding, the 
symbolism of having such a meeting at the very heart of 
Government had enormous impact." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  PAC Suspends Armed Struggle -- "The PAC's decision to 
suspend 
the armed struggle has been made dangerously late but is still 
very welcome," says a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 17 January. The organization has in the past 
renounced the struggle, and yet violence continued. "This has 
been evidence of scandalous opportunism," because while PAC 
leaders were in the mainstream of negotiations and were signing 
peace agreements, its armed wing, the Azanian People's 
Liberation Army, (APLA) continued its terror. The PAC on 
occasions tried to distance itself by claiming it was not really 
in control of its armed wing. "We accept that foreign 
governments have played a significant role in bringing the PAC 
to its senses." Big Western countries have for a long time been 
active behind the scenes. When African countries made the PAC 
realize that "its game was over," it had no choice but to 
suspend the armed struggle. "The PAC says the message on the 
ending of the struggle must be communicated to its people at 
ground level. This organization has to prove that it does have 
control over APLA. It will, therefore, have to play a credible 
role to help solve the problem it created." If not, the country 
will have to deal with violent elements which believe they can 
destabilize the country. The right wing, with its constant 
threats of a civil war, has to also realize this. "A continuing 
armed struggle will make everyone in the country a loser, while 
negotiations offer the country a second chance."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] THE STAR 
  Electoral Commission on Voting Disruption -- Johannesburg 
THE 
STAR in English on 20 January in a page 14 editorial welcomes 
the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] message that "it 
will not tolerate attempts to disrupt voting during the 
election." However, "the IEC warning that it will exclude from 
the final tally votes from areas where disruption has taken 
place is understandable, but this may not be enough to 
discourage interference. Rather, it risks playing into the 
hands of those intending to halt the process through 
intimidation and violence." 
  'Wrong' To Dismiss Right-Wing Threats -- A second editorial 
on the same page says details "are scanty" of the Afrikaner 
National Front (AVF) plan to implement its own transitional 
authority on 29 January. "On the face of it, this 
'implementation' looks like one more angry rally, another bit of 
right-wing theatre. Still, it would be wrong to dismiss as 
entirely empty the threats coming from the Right as the election 
draws closer." Public servants "have some potential to disrupt 
the country's administration. And it takes only a few crazies 
of the armed Right to cause more serious havoc." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Concern Over ANC Economic Statements -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 20 January in a page 4 editorial believes 
foreign confidence in South Africa's potential "is growing in 
line with domestic" confidence. However, the "diversity of 
opinion" within the ANC regarding its economic statements "has 
led to understandable uncertainty and concern over what the 
party can deliver while maintaining its appeal to a broad 
constituency if, as expected, it wins an absolute majority in 
April. For the present, strategy is focused on winning this 
year's election. Though attention has been paid to longer-term 
economic possibilities, electioneering has led to a significant 
element of economic populism forming part of the ANC's electoral 
platform. The question is, can sterile populism be dropped 
quietly after April and replaced with the fiscal policies, 
incentives and social stability needed if the present 
conditional optimism is to continue?" 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  PAC Leadership Divided Over Armed Struggle -- "The PAC, 
which 
has come in from the cold to take part in constitutional 
politics, is running into heavy weather both at home and abroad 
because of its equivocal attitude to violence and the alleged 
terrorist operations of its military wing, APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army]," declares a page 4 editorial in Cape 
Town CAPE TIMES in English on 14 January. The Tanzanian 
Government said it would no longer allow the PAC to "wage armed 
struggle from bases on Tanzanian territory," and now Zimbabwean 
President Mugabe "is under pressure to order APLA to close its 
training bases in Zimbabwe." CAPE TIMES says the Zimbabwean 
Government, "with its close links to the PAC, would do well to 
bring home to the confused and apparently divided leadership 
that they cannot have it both ways." 
  ANC Mines Policy -- A second editorial on the same page says 
the ANC's proposals for state ownership of South Africa's 
mineral wealth "should not rekindle nationalisation fears nor 
various other alarms associated with centrally-planned 
economies." CAPE TIMES believes the "thrust of the ANC mines 
policy appears unexceptionable, ensuring mining operations are 
conducted to the benefit of all." Unfortunately, the ANC policy 
"begins to go wonky when it comes to the call for the mining 
industry to develop innovative ways of creating black-owned 
mining houses. In the 1990's it makes more sense for government 
and the market place to look after that one, hopefully through 
the benefits of a growing economy based on free market 
principles."

  [Text] The UN mediator in the Angolan conflict today 
arrived in Luanda from Lusaka feeling optimistic about the peace 
talks between the government and UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola]. The national police dossier is 
nearly ready. Alioune Beye will be meeting in Luanda tomorrow 
with the directors of the World Food Program, before returning 
to Zambia. More details from Luanda from Paulo Juliao: 
  [Juliao] Early this evening Alioune Blondin Beye, the UN 
secretary general's special envoy to Angola and mediator at the 
peace talks between the Angolan government and UNITA, arrived in 
Luanda. Blondin Beye came to Luanda to meet the World Food 
Program's executive director who will be arriving here tomorrow. 
As usual, the UN diplomat showed optimism and reported that 
there has been considerable progress in Lusaka: 
  [Blondin Beye, in French] Since the resumption -- in fact we 
resumed on 6 January -- we have had a total of six working days. 
I reject allegations that we are dragging things out. This is 
not true. We are not progressing at the pace people expected. 
However, we are progressing. Had this not been true, the 
international community would not have allowed us to mark time 
in Lusaka. 
  [Juliao] Mr. Beye, can you tell us whether the issue 
relating 
to the police has been overcome? 
  [Blondin Beye, in French] We have almost overcome this 
because we have already approved a fair share of the general 
principles. As regards the other details, prior to my departure 
from Lusaka today, I conveyed to the government and UNITA 
delegations very concrete proposals which, in my view, should 
enable us to overcome this issue. 
  [Juliao] Blondin Beye is due to return to Lusaka tomorrow 
afternoon.

  [Text] The Lusaka talks are still covering specific issues 
of the national police force. Blondin Beye and the observers 
today met with the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. The government did not take part in the meeting 
and is not aware of the outcome of the meeting. Pedro Manuel 
reports from Lusaka: 
  There are contradictory reports about the new text dealing 
with specific issues. Yesterday the mediator and the observers 
were reported to have drafted a new document. Meanwhile, 
reliable sources say the mediator and the observers failed to 
put the final touches on the new document because UNITA did not 
cooperate. UNITA successively postponed its comments on the 
specific principles ruling the police force, alleging that it 
needed more time to evaluate the main document. Finally, this 
afternoon the UNITA negotiating team presented its position to 
the mediator and the observers, but it has not been possible to 
confirm this in view of the news blackout [preceding word in 
English]. 
  Meanwhile, the government is awaiting for Blondin Beye to 
give details about this afternoon's meeting between the 
mediator, the observers and UNITA. There are rumors that 
government and UNITA delegations will meet face to face tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Dhlakama's ultimatum"] </F>
  [Text] Maputo--Yesterday's Supervision and Control 
Commission [CSC] meeting closed shortly after it had begun. 
Meanwhile, Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] leader, delivered a serious ultimatum because of the 
slowness of government troop confinement. 
  At the Military Club, Raul Domingos had some "technical 
problems" while following the CSC meeting, which would end 
rather abruptly, shortly after the Cease-Fire Commission, CCF, 
had read its report. The meeting is regarded as crucial and is 
scheduled to resume today. 
  However, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has set 22 January as 
the deadline for the government to explain the reason for the 
poor turnout of its forces at confinement points. 
  Speaking shortly before the CSC meeting was due to open, the 
Renamo leader warned that "if by 22 January President Chissano 
has said nothing in connection with this matter, I shall order a 
stop to everything." The CSC meeting had been called to discuss 
the relaxation in government troop turnout at confinement points. 
  Afonso Dhlakama described as unacceptable the explanations 
given by the government so far. He added that, in addition to 
the fact that the Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, have means of 
transportation such as vehicles and aircraft, their troop 
confinement points are in easily accessible villages and 
district capitals. 
  Statistics provided by the UN Operations in Mozambique, 
Unomoz, indicate that Renamo has already confined more than 
5,400 men, as opposed to the government's 8,340 troops. The 
total number of men is about 80,000 on the government's side and 
20,000 on the Renamo side. This difference makes it clear that 
Renamo has so far confined a higher percentage of its forces 
than the government. 
  Dhlakama explained that his threat to stop the troop 
confinement process is linked to "pressure from my generals. 
They keep asking me: so, Mr. President, you are telling us to 
confine our troops, and yet the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] forces are still outside?" 
  Dhlakama noted that government soldiers are taking advantage 
of the fact that his men have gone into their confinement points 
to enter areas previously occupied by Renamo. "They (the 
government forces) are even murdering civilians in Milange and 
Angonia", the Renamo leader said. 
  Afonso Dhlakama said he was concerned about the fact that 
the 
international community has not condemned the government's 
behavior as vigorously as it has condemned Renamo so far. 
  "I get nervous, because when we explain that we cannot do 
this or that because Frelimo has not yet given us housing, that 
prompts Security Council meetings and pressures from this or 
that source...now, we have arrived at a crucial stage, we are 
confining men who used to fight each other with their 
weapons...this is a joke in poor taste."

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], says his forces will continue to be 
confined in assembly points despite the slow pace at which 
government troops are proceeding to their areas. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] The situation is bothersome 
because both sides are obliged to implement the General Peace 
Accord. Actually, I am disappointed with the situation. Yet, I 
am not prepared to cancel the confinement of troops because that 
would be helping the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] to 
continue making mistakes. 
  Earlier we said that if by 22 January Frelimo does not give 
any explanation we would look into the situation. Right now I 
am being pressured by our generals in the bush. They want to 
know why Frelimo is not confining its forces. I cannot give our 
generals a reason because I do not belong to Frelimo. So, the 
confinement will continue. We will not stop the confinement 
process. Right now we are working with the international 
community to see if it can pressure the Frelimo government. I 
am waiting for President Chissano to return to Maputo from his 
vacation to explain to me the situation in his capacity as 
commander in chief of the Frelimo army and head of state. 
Likewise, Defense Minister Chipande, Chief of General Staff 
Hama Thai, and Army Commander Tobias Dai should also explain why 
they are not sending their troops to the assembly points. [end

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], has withdrawn his warning that he would 
definitely cancel the confinement of his forces by 22 January 
should government troops continue to report to assembly points 
at a slow pace. Speaking in a telephone interview, the Renamo 
president said if his organization went ahead with the 
cancellation it would be helping Frelimo to continue making 
mistakes regarding the implementation of the General Peace 
Accord. Afonso Dhlakama said he felt disappointed with the slow 
pace at which government troops were reporting to assembly 
points, saying he has been under pressure from his generals and 
commanders who wish to know the reason for the executive's 
attitude. [as heard] The Renamo leader said, however, that the 
confinement of troops will continue.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, president of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo], met at his Maputo residence

particularly the training of government and Renamo instructors 
at Nyanga, Zimbabwe, as part of the formation of the future 
Mozambican army. The Renamo president and the British 
ambassador also reviewed the confinement of Renamo and 
government forces.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Knowledge Gathered in the United </F>
States Not Feasible for Mozambique"] 
  [Text] The military delegation of government and Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] representatives recently 
returned from the United States, feels that most of the 
knowledge gathered in that country is not feasible for 
Mozambique given the different levels of development in the two 
countries. 
  The delegation included Lieutenant Colonel Alfredo Maria and 
Frigate Captain Sebastiao Sarmento for the government, and 
Lieutenant Colonel Buta Jose and Colonel Fernando Canivete for 
Renamo. Ministry of Finance inspector Henrique Gamito was also 
part of the delegation. 
  The delegation spent 27 days in the United States, having 
had 
a number of meetings with government departments, dealing mainly 
with U.S. public opinion and the country's strategies for the 
process of pacification of Mozambique, U.S. experience in 
demobilization and socioeconomic reintegration of demobilized 
personnel, experiences of that country in the solution of 
conflicts and disputes of a social and political nature during 
the process of development of democracy, and the National Guard. 
  Speaking briefly to NOTICIAS and AIM [MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION 
AGENCY] journalists yesterday, the members of the delegation 
said their trip to the United States was designed to find out 
about the role of the military in democracy. 
  A member of the delegation said: "We got acquainted with 
that role during our visits to various U.S. states (Washington, 
Los Angeles, and others). [sentence as published] In our 
discussions we dealt with various issues relating to peace, 
demobilization, and democracy, notably during the tour of the 
Pentagon (U.S. Defense Department)." 
  Asked about the manner in which they thought of implementing 
the knowledge they acquired in the United States regarding the 
Mozambique pacification process, they said not all of it is 
feasible for our country given the major differences in levels 
of development. 
  According to them, the United States plans to demobilize 
about 700,000 men by 1995, while assuring all the resources for 
their reintegration into socioeconomic life. Mozambique also 
intends to demobilize a greater number, but it lacks the 
resources (jobs, money, and other means). [sentence as 
published] 
  A member of the delegation pointed out that for a country 
like ours, that knowledge is only feasible when it comes to 
organization and training of personnel. 
  The trip of the Mozambican military delegation to the United 
States was financed by the U.S. Embassy in Maputo.

  [Text] Gaza Provincial Governor Eugenio Numaio has 
described as unfounded the accusations made by Jose de Castro, 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] Foreign Affairs 
Department chief, that Renamo authorities are experiencing many 
difficulties because of the obstacles raised by provincial 
authorities. 
  On 14 January Jose de Castro granted an interview to Radio 
Mozambique in Xai-Xai during which he accused the Gaza 
Provincial Government in general, and Governor Eugenio Numaio in 
particular, of not even wanting to hear of Renamo in the 
province. He also said that the provincial government has not 
shown any interest in granting premises for the Renamo 
provincial branch to operate and to accommodate Renamo's three 
provincial advisers. 
  Gaza Provincial Governor Numaio noted that such accusations 
are typical of people who only know how to make demands and know 
little about the difficulties faced by those wanting to satisfy 
those needs.

  [Text] Mozambique's opposition Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] leader Afonso Dhlakama says he hopes to secure 
financial support when he visits the United Nations secretary 
general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, next month. Last Friday Mr. 
Dhlakama met the UN special envoy to Mozambique, Mr. Aldo 
Ajello, about raising funds to help Renamo to transform itself 
into a political party. Mr. Ajello said although he had 
appealed to the international community for support there had 
been little response beyond the 6 million dollars pledged by 
Italy early last year. Mr. Dhlakama said the international 
community promised him millions of dollars before he signed the 
Mozambican Peace Accord and that continued peace depended on 
having sufficient funds.

  [Text] The starting date for the training of Mozambique's 
infantry battalion involving Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] and government troops is now scheduled for the first 
week in February. The announcement was made by UN Operation 
Deputy Force Commander Brigadier Anisur Rahman following 
yesterday's meeting in Maputo of the Joint Commission charged 
with setting up the new army. 
  This date represents a new delay under the time table signed 
by the government, Renamo, and the UN last October. The 
training should have started this month. The 540 military 
instructors and [word indistinct] trained in Zimbabwe last year 
have returned to Mozambique. 
  Brig. Rahman said the government and Renamo will name the 
members who are going to be part of the country's military high 
command in 8 days' time from today. Both sides are reported to 
have already selected representatives for the high command. 
  The two sides also agreed on the insignia for the new army, 
on the criteria for the selection of troops who will be trained 
as special forces, and on norms for moving troops from assembly 
points where they are currently gathering, to the training 
centers.

violent action, using AKM weapons and mortars. The media office 
of the Maputo Provincial Police Command told NOTICIAS that the 
troops were demanding payment of annual bonus for 1993. There 
are no reports of vandalism or deaths, but the use of weapons 
resulted in Magude residents abandoning the area.

  [Text] The situation in Congo is extremely tense. Sporadic 
shooting from heavy artillery and bursts of automatic machinegun 
fire were heard this morning in the southern district of 
Brazzaville, especially at Bacongo and Makelekele districts, 
which have been sealed off for the past three days by government 
forces. Armored cars have been deployed at Makelekele district 
over the past three days in an attempt to prevent new clashes 
between the opposition coalition militia and government forces. 
These clashes have claimed about 75 lives in southern 
Brazzaville since mid- December. 
  The cordoning off of Bacongo is the result of the kidnapping 
of Lieutenant Jonathan Mabiala, an officer of the presidential 
security, who has still not been found. The presidential 
security has accused the private militia of opposition leader 
Bernard Kolelas of carrying out the kidnapping. The opposition 
has denied any involvement in this affair. 
  Meanwhile, about 100 armed supporters of the presidential 
group gathered around the seat of the ruling party, the 
Pan-African Union for Social Democracy this morning. They are 
demanding their integration into the Army. According to 
witnesses, the police did not intervene.

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 20 (AFP) -- A rocket attack damaged 
a police station Thursday [20 January] in the northern Ouenze 
area of Brazzaville, which has been rocked by fighting among 
government supporters, troops and opposition militias. 
  A second rocket attack blew out the windows of a bank in the 
same district, witnesses said. No casualties were reported from 
the attacks and it was unclear who was responsible. 
  In December, a policeman was killed when unidentified gunmen 
opened fire on another police station in the Ouenze district, 
which had hitherto been spared the violence raging largely in 
the south of the Congolese capital. 
  In another incident, a group of opposition militiamen on 
Thursday attacked a street market in the southwestern M'filou 
area, but nobody was hurt, witnesses said. 
  The militia was protesting against the sealing off by 
government troops and presidential guards of Makele-kele and the 
Bacongo district, an opposition stronghold in the south, 
following the disappearance at the weekend of presidential guard 
lieutenant, Jonathan Mabiala. 
  Small arms fire overnight in both these districts was due to 
clashes between militiamen backing President Pascal Lissouba and 
armed opposition forces, a military source said. 
  The guard has accused the private militia of opposition 
leader Bernard Kolelas of seizing Mabiala, but the opposition 
has denied any part in the affair. 
  Since mid-December, clashes in Brazzaville following 
contested elections have left some 115 people dead in the south 
of the city.

<F P=106> [By Mario Fiorito] </F>
  [Text] Kinshasa, Jan 19 (AFP) -- The home of Etienne 
Tshisekedi, arch-foe of Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, was 
surrounded by troops Wednesday [19 January] as a strike called 
by opponents of the regime won wide support, an opposition 
spokesman said. 
  Troops surrounded and sealed off Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home 
early in the morning according to his close advisor and former 
Tshisekedi government communications minister, Lambert Mende. 
  Kinshasha streets were deserted Wednesday morning in answer 
to an appeal from Tshisekedi for a strike to protest Marshal 
Mobuto's dissolution of rival parliaments. 
  Frequent gunfights in the capital overnight also helped 
clear markets and close shops. However, the volatile 
working-class districts of the city were reported quiet 
Wednesday morning. 
  Tshisekedi has been in a year-long stand-off with Mobuto 
following his refusal to step down as prime minister when the 
president dismissed him in October 1992, dissolving his whole 
government in February 1993. 
  Tshisekedi was foisted as premier on the reluctant Mobuto by 
a national conference that began its work, often interrupted by 
political strife and bloodshed, in 1991. 
  The latest conflict was sparked by Mobuto's declaration last 
week that the signing of a political agreement between his own 
Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) movement and the radical 
Holy Alliance opposition coalition entailed the dissolution of 
the country's rival parliaments. 
  The High Council of the Republic (HCR), appointed by the 
national conference in 1992, and the National Assembly, 
comprising members of the former sole, ruling People's Movement 
of the Revolution (MPR), both claim legislative authority. 
  Mobutu called for a meeting Wednesday among members of the 
rival bodies, which he wanted grouped in a new high council, to 
consider a new constitution and the premiership of the large, 
impoverished central African nation of more than 38 million 
people. 
  The HCR, however, has refused to accept Mobutu's position, 
as 
it refused to accept the authority of Faustin Birindwa, the 
prime minister he appointed after dismissing Tshisekedi for a 
second time in two years in October 1992. 
  The HCR has been summoned into session around midday 
Thursday 
by its vice-president, Joseph Ileo, a member of Tshisekedi's 
Christian Democrat and Social Party (PDSC), who stated that the 
HCR would not attend the meeting proposed by Mobutu. 
  The HCR president, Archbishop of Kisingani Laurent Mosengwo 
Pasinya, had called for a meeting of the council as soon as 
possible to discuss forming a single body with the national 
assembly. 
  Mobuto's 29-year-old regime is showing increasing signs of 
falling apart with mounting reluctance of his main backers, 
former colonial power Belgium, France, and the United States to 
support him.

  [Text] Sparks have been going off in Zaire since this 
morning. Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's ghost city campaign seems to 
doing very well in Kinshasa. No one bothered to go to work on 
the morning of 19 January. Things have been flaring up around 
the transitional prime minister's residence, which was 
surrounded by the Presidential Guard at daybreak. Several Union 
for Democracy and Social Progress -- Tshisekedi's party -- 
activists immediately responded to defend their leader. Here 
is an account by Djouko Moulopo, the charge d'affaires of the 
permanent representation of Tshisekedi's government in Brussels. 
  [Begin Moulopo recording] The ghost city campaign launched 
by the opposition in protest against President Mobutu's illegal 
and anti constitutional acts has been followed totally by the 
population. At the moment, we fear for the prime minister's 
life because we have been informed from Kinshasa that the prime 
minister's residence has been totally surrounded by the (?DSP) 
and the (?ZARM) [expansion unknown]. Combatants are protecting 
the prime minister and exchanging fire with the soldiers. This 
is the situation as it stands in Kinshasa. Army troops are 
positioned at strategic points. [end recording] 
  This renewed tension jeopardizes the 19 January meeting 
convened by President Mobutu between the High Council of the 
Republic and the National Assembly, which should lead to the 
merger of the two organs and the election of a new prime 
minister. The choice is between Mr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Mulumba 
Lukoji. As Djouko Moulopo points out in no uncertain terms, the 
radical opposition is not at all happy about this: 
  [Begin Moulopo recording] President Mobutu has no right or 
freedom to convene the High Council of Republic. If he had 
convened his former assembly, we would understand that, but 
Monsignor Monsengwo has declared that he did not have to fall in 
line with President Mobutu's position, because it is an anti 
constitutional act, which is not laid down in the transitional 
act on the provisions for the new constitution in Zaire. 
Therefore in our view, there is no High Council of the Republic 
in Zaire today. [end recording]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 19 Jan (AFP) -- Zairian security forces 
have now withdrawn from around the home of opposition leader 
Etienne Tshisekedi after sealing off his residence during 
Wednesday morning, one of his close aides said. There has been 
no official explanation of why the troops surrounded 
Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home but the move appeared to be linked to 
a strike on Wednesday called by him to protest the dissolution 
last week by President Mobutu Sese Seko of the country's rival 
legislatures. Shops and most offices stayed closed and the 
capital's streets were virtually empty of traffic all day.

  [Excerpt] Slowly but surely the democracy bandwagon 
continues on course. All those who delay in joining it or who 
fail to join will be left behind. In accordance with President 
Mobutu's decree, endorsing the wish expressed by the political 
class during the Palais du Peuple consultations, an 
extraordinary session of the High Council of the Republic, 
Transitional Parliament, was officially opened at 1600 at the 
Palais du Peuple today. The first session was devoted to the 
registration of the members and the management of the new 
Parliament. It must be pointed out that the political class' 
decision to have Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo chair the High 
Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament -- beginning 
from the next session -- was unanimously approved. Proceedings 
are to resume at 1500 at the Palais du Peuple on 20 January. 
All members of the High Council, Transitional Parliament are 
requested to attend the meeting. Toum Bamba Toulou has just 
arrived from the Palais du Peuple and gives us further details: 
  [Begin Toulou recording] The atmosphere at the Palais du 
Peuple was good. Mr. Moulenda Loutoula, parliamentary secretary 
general, chaired the inaugural session of the High Council of 
the Republic, Transitional Parliament. There were almost 400 
members from the defunct National Assembly, the defunct High 
Council of the Transition, which was set up following the 
Sovereign National Conference. Negotiators from the two 
political groups -- the Political Forces of the Conclave, as 
well as the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allied 
Groups -- who worked arduously to obtain the protocol agreement 
which will govern the transitional period, were also present. 
  There are three items on the agenda of this extraordinary 
session, which should not exceed 15 days. As of tomorrow, the 
session will be chaired by Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of High 
Council of the Republic, Transitional Parliament in accordance 
with the spirit of the accord. First, there will be the 
internal organization of the Parliament, that is, the 
examination and ratification of the mandate of the members, then 
the drawing up and adoption of internal regulations, the 
election of the final executive bureau, and the setting up of 
working commissions. The honorable councillors will also set up 
and adopt the constitutional act for the transitional period. 
The last item will be the election of the person who will head 
the final transitional government. All the items on the agenda 
are important, but the one concerning the election of the prime 
minister is very delicate. This is why we are repeating our 
call that there must be good will, clearheadedness, and moral 
and intellectual sincerity from all sides so that a judicious 
and conscientious choice for the prime minister will be made.

  [Text] After the decision by the political class to set up 
a single chamber parliament based on the head of state's 
decision to allow the political class to reach a consensus on 
ending the dual parliamentarian institutions as well as other 
institutions of the Republic, the former High Council of the 
Republic [HCR] established by the Sovereign National Conference, 
has just agreed to endorse this new institution that will 
include all former deputies, former HCR members, and former 
advisors. During a special HCR session at the People's Palace, 
which was attended by 368 members, 223 voted for the decision 
while 80 voted against and 60 abstained. 
  As we can see, the political will expressed during the 
negotiations has finally prevailed and each participant has 
expressed his accord in line with his own views, sometimes with 
different words or different procedures. The main thing, 
however, is that the people have now understood and that the 
entire political class is driven by a single ideal, that of 
putting an end to dual Republican institutions, which is a happy 
prelude to fair and free elections.

  [Text] The members of the Alliance of Independent Forces 
for Radical Change [AFICR] platform met on 17 January under the 
chairmanship of Mr. Bonaventure Muanateba to examine the latest 
message to the nation by the head of state. In this regard, 
Muanateba's AFICR reaffirmed and supported the appointment of a 
prime minister without political leanings. 
  For its part, the Active Forces of AFICR [FAAFICR], who also 
met on 17 January, support the candidacy of Professor Mulumba 
Lukoji to the office of prime minister. In addition, 
nationalists, parliamentarians, counselors to the republic, 
party leaders, and associations from civil society have decided 
to support Professor Mulumba Lukoji's candidacy. 
  On this issue, we have also received the reaction of the 
Young Mobutists Front [FROJEMO] on the present political 
situation. Here is our report: 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified spokesman] Members of 
the AFICR platform met today, Monday 17 January, under the 
chairmanship of Bonaventure Muanateba Tomuningo Mushinua, 
chairman, to examine the head of state's latest message to the 
nation. After the meeting, the following steps were taken: 
  1. On the question of candidates for the post of prime 
minister, AFICR notes with regret that the present approach by 
the head of state consisting in presenting two candidates, 
Tshisekedi wa Mulumba and Mulumba Lukoji, who come from the same 
region and belong to the same tribe, could bring us back to the 
situation experienced in 1965 between Prime Ministers Tsombe and 
Kimba, both from Katanga. It therefore reaffirms and supports 
the appointment of a prime minister without political leanings. 
  2. On the question of representation in the High Council of 
the Republic [HCR], the interim parliament, the AFICR condemns 
the bi- polarization which excludes (?the forces) already on the 
country's political arena. As a center platform, it demands its 
80 seats in the HCR in order to get involved with the others -- 
including Antoine Gisenga's UFONAL [expansion unknown] -- in 
working out mechanisms for running the country. 
  3. On the dissolution of parliament and the HCR, the AFICR 
deplores the attitude of certain political leaders who view and 
describe the ordinance dissolving the parliament -- i.e. the HCR 
-- and convening at the same time the extraordinary session of 
the HCR, interim parliament, as a coup d'etat, whereas all that 
the head of state did was to apply the will of the negotiators. 
  4. Concerning Monsignor Monsengwo, the AFICR advises the 
Catholic prelate to take advantage of this opportunity to leave 
the political scene and leave politics to politicians. 
  5. On the wave of illegal occupation of government houses, 
the AFICR demands that such occupants be convicted and that the 
Zairian state retrieve these houses without further delay. 
  6. Lastly, the AFICR reminds everyone in the national and 
international community that there is only a one and indivisible 
AFICR, in compliance with Article 9 of the Charter, led by Mr. 
Bonaventure Muanateba, its presidium chairman. 
  [Second unidentified spokesman] [Words indistinct] Professor 
Mulumba Lukoji as candidate for the post of prime minister. We 
nationalists, parliamentarians, counselors to the republic, 
negotiators, leaders of political parties and associations in 
civil society, met today on the eve of the first session of the 
HCR -- interim parliament -- to examine the situation prevailing 
in the country. 
  Considering the head of state's two messages to the nation, 
to which we fully subscribe; 
  Considering that after the second message of 14 January more 
than half of the negotiators signed the so-called People's 
Palace accords, thereby approving the scheme recommended by 
these accords as a means of ending the crisis our country is 
passing through; 
  Considering that the implementation of these accords implies 
the setting up of a representative government of national unity, 
headed by a politically neutral, unifying, and nationalist prime 
minister who will steer a conflict-free transition; 
  Have, in the light of the foregoing, decided to give our 
full 
and unreserved support to the candidacy of Prof. Mulumba Lukoji 
for the post of prime minister. 
  [Third unidentified spokesman] The FAAFICR met this Monday, 
16 [as heard] January, at their usual headquarters to consider 
the speech delivered by the president on Friday, 14 January, at 
2000. At the end of this important meeting, the following 
decisions were made: 
  1. The FAAFICR recalls for the benefit of the national and 
international community its communique of 5 January demanding a 
unifying prime minister who is not known to have championed the 
cause of politics of exclusion and who is accepted by all 
regions so as to avoid a splitting of Zaire into several states. 
  2. The FAAFICR is unable to understand the position of the 
radical opposition when, in a letter dated 12 January, it 
presents the candidacy of Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi, seeking his 
appointment to the post of prime minister by an ordinance of the 
head of state, whereas all along Mr. Tshisekedi has been the 
only legally recognized prime minister appointed by the 
sovereign national conference. If that is the case, why seek a 
fresh appointment by presidential decree? One then understands 
someone is poking fun at our people -- and this is very 
dangerous for the future of our country. 
  3. Lastly, the FAAFICR supports Prof. Mulumba Lukoji's 
candidacy to the post of prime minister. In his case, at least, 
even though he hails from Kasai Oriental, he is accepted by his 
people -- first, by Katanga and then by the other regions as a 
whole -- and Zaire can bank on him. 
  [Fourth unidentified spokesman] We, youngsters of FROJEMO, 
thank the head of state and the entire political class for the 
efforts they are making at the moment to get the country out of 
the predicament in which we find ourselves. The people count on 
them and we believe today's meeting will be an important one and 
will be marked in letters of gold in the history of our country. 
So we will not talk much. We sincerely wish them a successful 
meeting in order that Zaire may live long. [end recording]

  [Text] The Ethiopian transitional government's foreign 
minister has noted that, although we do not oppose the Sudanese 
Government's ideology, which it is implementing in its country 
and believes will assist its country, the expansion of its 
ideology to neighboring countries should be stopped -- because 
it concerns us as well. 
  Mr. Mesfin Seyoum, in a statement to the Saudi Arabian ARAB 
NEWS newspaper, said that Sudan should think twice before 
deciding to expand its ideology to neighboring countries, and 
noted that we may understand each other if Sudan is limited to 
implementing its ideology on its territory only. 
  The foreign minister went on to say that trying to expand 
ideology in a way which would affect the peace and stability of 
neighboring countries would affect the countries concerned. Mr. 
Mesfin, answering a question on how he views the conflict which 
arose between Eritrea and Sudan, said anything which affects the 
peace and stability of neighboring countries will concern us, 
because it will also affect our peace and stability. Mr. Mesfin 
noted however that open and clear discussions were underway 
between the two countries.

  [Text] Osman Hassan Ali, alias Osman Ato, Professor 
Mohamed Hassan Awaleh, and Omar Salad Ilmi held a press 
conference this morning at the United Somali Congress [USC] 
headquarters, Mogadishu, in which they spoke about their illegal 
detention in a UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] jail, in addition 
to other problems they had recently encountered. The honorables 
gave an account of how they were kidnapped from their homes on 
21 September and 3 October 1993 and how they had been treated 
until their release on 10 January 1994. 
  The honorables started by saying that for the first 24 hours 
of their kidnapping they had been handcuffed, no food had been 
provided to them, and water was in very short supply. Shortly 
afterwards, they were taken to an island off the coast of 
Kismaayo, which was barely fit for human habitation, as the 
temperature was 40 degrees Celsius during the daytime and very 
cold at night. 
  The honorables went on to say that in disrespect to their 
religion UNOSOM sometimes added pork to their meals -- but they 
threw it away. They said after some time they fell ill in 
detention and their request for treatment fell on deaf ears, 
resulting in a deterioration in their health. They also stated 
that they were subjected to terrible noises coming from jet 
fighters and helicopters, with the aim of terrorizing them. The 
citizens also said that the reason for their being taken to 
Baidoa was to attempt to prove that they were the ones 
responsible for all acts against UNOSOM troops.

  [Excerpt] Osman Hassan Ali, alias Osman Ato, a member of 
the United Somali Congress [USC] central committee, speaking on 
behalf of the eight citizens detained by UN Operation Somalia 
[UNOSOM] after being illegally kidnapped from their homes, today 
addressed thousands of jovial people at 1 July Independence 
Square. The demonstrators carried placards and the flag of the 
Republic of Somalia, and chanted: "Down with Somalia's enemies" 
"UNOSOM leave Somalia", "may the agreement to unite Somalia 
succeed" and other slogans. 
  The rally was first addressed by Awil Ahmad Abdi, from the 
Somali Democratic Movement and Mohamed Ahmad Nur, the USC 
secretary for reconstruction and rehabilitation, who greeted and 
congratulated the Somali citizens that UNOSOM had illegally 
kidnapped from their homes. They also congratulated the Somali 
National Alliance supporters, particularly those from Mogadishu 
and its surrounding environs, who had been holding non-stop 
demonstrations which, they said, finally forced UNOSOM to 
release the officials they had illegally detained. 
  Speaking on behalf of the eight citizens, Osman Hassan Ali 
thanked the Somali people and said that history would not forget 
those people involved in the struggle against the UNOSOM troops. 
Osman Hassan Ali said that they had done something which had 
been lacking in Somalia and the African continent, and that this 
had sent a clear signal to foreigners that they could not do 
whatever they wished to an independent country and people. 
Referring to the agreement reached between brother Somalis and 
signed at the Kah Hotel in Mogadishu, he said he strongly 
supported it, pointing out that the agreement was the key for 
peace and stability to come about in Somalia. In conclusion, he 
appealed to the Somali people to show tolerance, fortitude, and 
mutual respect for each other's rights. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin by Sayyid </F>
Ahmad Khalifah in Jeddah; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khalifah] What are the aims and results of your 
current visit to Saudi Arabia and how do you view the 
development of relations between the two countries? 
  [Seyoum] Our relations with the Saudi Kingdom are old, 
advanced, and based on goodneighborliness and mutual respect. 
We seek to strengthen and develop them further through exchange 
of visits and contacts. 
  On this visit we have focused on political, trade, and 
economic ties and on the various Saudi sectors benefiting from 
the trade and investment atmosphere in Ethiopia, which now has a 
free economy in the full sense of the word. 
  [Khalifah] Has your country achieved the necessary stability 
that would encourage investment? What were the circumstances 
relating to the question of the opposition conference and the 
arrests which followed? 
  [Seyoum] Ethiopia is a democratic country in the full sense 
of the word. We have about 100 political parties and 
organizations. They all exercise their rights freely in 
accordance with the national charter which recognizes the full 
rights of the Ethiopian people and nationalities. There are 
dozens of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals which are free 
to publish what they like. 
  That democratic thrust does not worry anyone. Quite the 
contrary, there have been positive developments throughout the 
country, especially in the economic and security fields. 
  What happened recently, however, was that some groups called 
for armed action against the state and the public on the pretext 
of making political gains which can be achieved through open 
democratic activity for all. Some opposition parties have held 
a conference attended by some expatriates. Although thousands 
attended that conference and opposed the government and its 
programs, the government's view was that that was their right, 
but some of those who came from abroad to attend the conference 
openly called for and expressed their belief in armed action to 
fulfill their political convictions. It is the government's 
duty to prevent such action, which would be a threat to peace 
and security in a country that has historically suffered the 
calamities of futile and unjustified internal and external wars. 
  In discharging our duties as a government we arrested seven 
of these warmongers. Two of them have since been released. The 
other five will stand trial. 
  [Khalifah] You have postponed the parliamentary and 
presidential elections several times. Has a final date been set 
for that? 
  [Seyoum] The elections were postponed because of known 
compelling reasons related to the strengthening of democracy in 
a country that is experiencing democracy for the first time 
ever. It has been decided to hold the elections next June. 
Then the permanent constitution will be drawn up. It will be 
the first in the history of Ethiopia's pluralistic rule. 
  [Khalifah] Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki has spoken of 
difficulties in his country's relations with Sudan. How would 
you describe your country's relations with Sudan? Are there 
difficulties there too? 
  [Seyour] We have, over the past two and a half years, been 
trying hard to normalize relations with Sudan and we will 
continue to do so despite some problems with these relations. 
Unless these problems are solved, we expect more difficulties 
and they would become public as in the case of Eritrean-Sudanese 
relations. 
  [Khalifah] What is the nature of your problems with Sudan? 
  [Seyoum] The same kind of problems Afewerki spoke about when 
addressing his relations with Sudan, which supports religious 
groups to undermine security and stability in the neighboring 
countries, and we are one of these countries. We would, of 
course, like Sudan to think hard before extending these 
practices to the neighboring countries. We can live with Sudan 
and others in peace only when each side keeps its convictions, 
views, and ideologies within its own borders. 
  [Khalifah] Has the Eritrean Government given you the details 
of its problems with Sudan before or after recent developments? 
  [Seyoum] Exporting trouble to Eritrea or any state bordering 
on Sudan would certainly affect us and we should of necessity 
have knowledge of its details and developments. In our 
relations with Sudan we are also suffering, the same as Eritrea. 
So long as Sudan pursues these policies in Eritrea it would 
naturally pursue them in our country. Despite all that, we do 
not believe that this situation has asssumed major proportions 
but we want it to end in the interests of both countries. We 
are discussing these matters with Sudan with complete frankness 
and clarity in order to iron out these problems. 
  [Khalifah] Have your ties with the Western states suffered 
as a result of your relations with Sudan when they were good? 
  [Seyoumr] We have always discussed with the West our 
relations with Sudan, and we have always sought to contribute to 
the normalization of relations between Sudan and others. Sudan 
has no other option. 
  As regards the West's contribution to our country's economy, 
we are fully satisfied with Western and U.S. aid and are trying 
to use that aid in rebuilding our country, which was devastated 
by internal and external problems and wars that are now things 
of the past and will not be repeated. 
  [Khalifah] Have all the Ethiopian refugees returned to their 
country? 
  [Seyoum] We are working with the United Nations for the 
voluntary return of all the Ethiopian refugees. About 13,000 of 
them returned from Sudan last year and large numbers returned 
from Kenya and Djibouti. We seek to support the returnees and 
encourage the return of the others. 
  [Khalifah] Is your country continuing its efforts to solve 
the Somali problem, having failed in its latest efforts to 
achieve that objective? 
  [Seyoum] Although we cannot do for Somalia more than we have 
done and are doing, we are definitely interested in Somalia's 
security and stability because there are about 1 million 
Ethiopian Somalis and about half a million Somali refugees in 
our country. That is why an effective solution for the Somali 
problem would very much interest us, not least because of its 
importance for the security and stability of our country and the 
region and for the preservation of its resources.

  [Text] Chadians have certainly not yet come to the end of 
their misfortunes. In addition to the nonpayment of their 
salary arrears and the devaluation of the CFA franc, the specter 
of war has also come to trouble (?their fragile peace). At 0420 
this morning, the inhabitants of Abeche woke up to the sounds of 
automatic weapons fire and exploding shells. Elements of the 
Chadian National Front [FNT] had attacked the Chadian National 
Army [FAT] troops in Abeche. Our correspondent (Solomon 
Ngartha) has the details: 
  [Begin Ngartha recording] At 0450 today, elements of the FNT 
present in Abeche, who were awaiting their integration into the 
FAT--in accordance with previously signed agreements--attacked 
the government troops stationed there, (?flouting) those 
agreements. 
  The assailants launched their attack on the military 
garrison 
during the first hours of the morning. First they attacked a 
training center storeroom and obtained 405 light weapons, 
including bazookas, [word indistinct], and Kalishnikov assault 
rifles. Once in possession of these weapons, they then attacked 
other weapons depots at the camp, including an (?operations) 
storeroom where they looted (Bavar 82) 60-mm mortars, in 
addition to a large quantity of personnel weapons. 
  We visited a military camp this morning in the company of 
National Defense Minister (Mamadou M'biyi); Youssouf Togoimi, 
the prefect of the area; and top military officers, including 
(Tetengar), the deputy commander; Lieutenant Colonel (Gbese 
Moussa); and Lieutenant Colonel Moussa Haroun. We observed 
traces of blood, forced doors, and SAM-7's which had been 
destroyed. During our visit to the camp, we were constantly 
coming across dead bodies lying on the ground. These were the 
bodies of FNT rebels who had been killed by government forces. 
Within the camp alone, nine corpses were lying on the ground. 
In the [words indistinct] running along the Abeche market, two 
other corpses were observed, covered with dust. At the entrance 
to the residence of the prefect, two other corpses were seen on 
the ground. Not far from the sign indicating the road to [name 
indistinct], another rebel (?who was shot in the back was seen). 
  For the moment, relative calm reigns in the town of Abeche, 
punctuated by the sounds of isolated firing. Elements of the 
government forces are carrying out mopping up operations. The 
attackers have fled toward [name indistinct]. They are being 
pursued by government forces. The official provisional results 
of the attack say 29 rebels were killed and 32 were captured. 
On the government side, two people have been killed and nine 
injured. Seven of these people were seriously wounded and were 
evacuated this afternoon to Ndjamena. A curfew has been imposed 
on the town of Abeche by the prefect. It runs from 1900 to 
0600. [end recording]

  [Text] The situation is still confused in Congo, where the 
southern Brazzaville districts of Bacongo and Makelekele are 
being watched closely by the security forces following the 
kidnapping of Lieutenant Jonathan Mabiala of Presidential 
Security. Sporadic gunshots are heard. Indeed, in 
violence-prone Congo, no day is ever like the one before it. 
The government blames the opposition for this worsening 
situation, an accusation rejected by the opposition in the words 
of Bernard Kolelas, who spoke to Anastasie Kengue: 
  [Begin Kolelas recording] The situation prevailing in Congo 
now is characterized by continued clashes, always started by 
security forces of the presidential coalition. At this very 
moment, tanks [words indistinct] have lined up at (Moutabala) 
and are shooting directly into the working class district of 
(Ndoto), the Major Seminary, and the [word indistinct] district. 
For the past four days, there has been a blockade of the 
Makelekele and Bacongo districts. The radio told us today that 
the blockade is a routine operation because opposition activists 
(?were crossing over) to cause trouble in the northern districts 
of the capital, which is a blatant lie. They have put the 
Makelekele and Bacongo districts under blockade. For the past 
four days [words indistinct] the soldiers of the presidential 
coalition and elements of the (?Civil) Guard--I mean, the 
security forces of the presidential coalition. This is an absurd 
operation because it is an act of self-suffocation. The sectors 
placed under blockade are the areas where the government's key 
ministries are located: the Ministry of Planning and Economic 
Affairs, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Ministry of 
Finance and Budget, the Ministry of Interior, and the Department 
of Customs and Excise. [end recording]

  [Text] The head of state, President Pascal Lissouba, 
received French Ambassador Andre Michel this morning. The two 
men took this opportunity to review the relations between Congo 
and France, said the French diplomat after his audience with the 
president. 
  [Begin recording] [Michel] President Lissouba and I met to 
review the relations between Congo and France. Our discussions 
focused on cooperation in fields that could strengthen relations 
between the two countries. We also discussed development 
projects that could be implemented quickly to solve some social 
problems and benefit the most destitute of the Congolese people. 
We have already held an initial meeting with Congolese partners 
and foreign financial backers to associate them with the 
implementation of the first identified projects that will be 
launched in the next two weeks. That is the general outline of 
our discussions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] You said you reviewed bilateral 
relations between France and Congo. On this issue, Congolese 
are interested to know the nature of the relations between Congo 
and France. Are these relations excellent, or is something 
wrong with regard to what is happening in our country these days? 
  [Michel] Our relations are excellent. From our point of 
view, there are no problems with Congo except those relating to 
the insecurity prevailing in the Congolese capital, and that is 
a subject of concern for the French nationals residing here. In 
addition, we should not forget the problem relating to the 
devaluation of the CFA franc and the ensuing economic problems. 
All these factors should be studied with utmost care and 
serenity, and we believe there are solutions to all these 
problems and that security should be ensured. We will 
contribute to its maintenance, as we have in the past through 
cooperation. As for the devaluation of the CFA franc, we are 
naturally very much alert to how the situation will evolve, to 
the cost of living, and to the price of essential goods. With 
the assent of the Congolese authorities, we will see if there is 
a need to facilitate things and help out in maintaining things 
in reasonable proportion for the Congolese people. 
  [Correspondent] You are talking about insecurity. France 
should consider the fact that it is responsible for what is 
happening in Brazzaville, and the French Government has 
announced that the centennial of the Brazzaville conference will 
be finally celebrated in France. Why is this? 
  [Michel] Listen, the centennial of the Brazzaville 
Conference 
is an important event that the Congolese authorities intend to 
celebrate in favorable and satisfactory security conditions. 
All Congolese, regardless of their political ideas, should 
associate themselves with this important moment in the bistory 
of Congo, Franco-Congolese history, and African history. Today, 
of course, we agree that serenity and security do not exist, and 
the Congolese authorities have wisely suggested that it should 
be postponed to a later date. France--which is celebrating a 
centennial, the liberation of France, the landing, and the 
Brazzaville Conference--will also commemorate all these 
important events on 30 January. This will not prevent the 
Congolese authorities from celebrating this anniversary. We 
will celebrate with them, and all the works we began on the 
occasion will continue and will be completed in time. 
  [Correspondent] Speaking of insecurity, I wanted to say that 
France (?has its share) of responsibility in this. 
  [Michel] France does not feel responsible for this 
situation. 
What is happening today in Congo is the responsibility of the 
Congolese people. I think they have some difficulties as far as 
internal politics is concerned, and these problems should be 
resolved through democratic practices and the Constitution. The 
country has institutions that are functional. We are saying 
today that if the Congolese institutions are functional, they 
should continue to be so that all the Congolese people should be 
able to express themselves through them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Council of Ministers met yesterday under the 
chairmanship of President Pascal Lissouba. Concerned about the 
living conditions of the people, the government members devoted 
most of their meeting to the work being done by the monitoring 
committee set up to monitor the effects of the CFA devaluation. 
[passage omitted] 
  During the cabinet meeting, the government of the Republic 
officially denounced actions committed by armed gangs of the 
opposition. The government accused Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the 
former Congolese head of state, of using his private home as a 
center for the rape of foreigners and nationals, and Bernard 
Kolelas, of using [words indistinct], for the same purpose. The 
Council of Ministers pointed this out while examining a 
resolution from the European Parliament on the Congolese 
political situation. Listen to government spokesperson 
Albertine Lipou Massala: 
  [Begin Massala recording] The Council of Ministers expressed 
satisfaction over the concern of the European parliamentarians 
for peace in Congo. It is the wish of the government of the 
Republic that the same attention be devoted to the 20,000 
homeless persons who were victims of the violence imposed by the 
insurrectional armed groups of the opposition. The Council of 
Ministers finds it unacceptable that armed gangs of the 
opposition should be attacking their own countrymen and even 
extend their violence to foreigners--in particular European 
Union nationals who have chosen the Congo as their home. The 
Council of Ministers has noted with [words indistinct] that from 
information at its disposal, the international community [words 
indistinct] through its various representatives in Brazzaville, 
that the cases of rape and sequestration of nationals from the 
European Union and Congolese nationals have been carried out in 
the private residence of Denis Sassou-Nguesso, former head of 
state, and in the [word indistinct] of Bernard Kolelas. [end

<F P=106> [Decision by the Constitutional Court rejecting an appeal </F>
for the annulment of the 5 December 1993 presidential elections 
and confirming the election of incumbent President Omar Bongo; 
read by Marie Madeleine Boransouo, Constitutional Court 
president--live or recorded] 
  [Text] Considering that all appeals for annulment were 
filed against the same adversary for the same motive and subject 
and that there is the need to consider them to make a unique 
decision on them; considering that the plaintiffs referred the 
matter to the Constitutional Court mainly to have it declare the 
annulment of the 5 December 1993 election and consequently the 
announcement made on 9 December in this regard by the minister 
of territorial administration and that, to back their appeals, 
they mentioned the violation of Articles 18, 21, 60, 73, 91, 96, 
98, and 99 of the electoral laws; 
  Considering--in the case of (Assa Ovono)--that the last 
paragraph of Article 84 of the [words indistinct] Constitution 
that the Constitutional Court is referred to in case of 
rejection of the validity of an election by any voter, 
candidate, political party, or a government's delegate in the 
conditions provided for by an organic law, that Law 9/91 of 26 
September 1991 concerning the Constitutional Court states in its 
Article 67, paragraph 2, that a voter can only appeal for the 
annulment of the electoral operations of the polling station 
where he is supposed to vote. (?In this regard), as a simple 
voter, (Assa Ovono) cannot appeal for the annulment of the 
entire 5 December 1993 poll. 
  Considering--in the case of the other plaintiffs--that 
Article 2 of the Constitution sanctions the principle of 
indivisibility of the Republic and that Article 3 reaffirms that 
the national sovereignty belongs to the people and that they 
exercise it directly through referendum or election in 
accordance with the principle of multiparty democracy and 
indirectly through the constitutional institutions, while 
Article 7 warns that any act threatening the Republic entity, 
unity, secularity of the state, sovereignty, and independence 
constitute a high treason crime punished by the law; considering 
that following the announcement of the results of the 5 December 
1993 by the minister of territorial administration, Paul Mba 
Abessole self-proclaimed president of the Gabonese Republic, 
that on the same day he appointed a prime minister, namely 
Pierre Andre Kombila, and that they deliberately placed 
themselves in illegality, thus ignoring the existence of the 
Constitution and therefore the institutions legally put in 
place; and considering that as a result of their belonging to 
these so-called Republican institutions, the plaintiffs have 
incessantly, ostensibly, and on a daily basis carried out acts 
that make a section of the people consider them as legitimate 
authorities, and that these acts threaten the unity of the state 
and national sovereign, there is reason to reject their appeals. 
  We therefore decide: 
  Article 1. The appeal for annulment of the results of the 5 
December 1993 poll filed by (Assa Ovono) is not receivable. 
  Article 2. Also declared nonreceivable are the appeals 
filed at the same time by Paul Mba Abessole, Pierre Louis 
Agondjo-Okawe, Peierre-Claver Maganga-Oussavou, Jean-Pierre 
Lemboumba Lepandou, Jules Aristide Bourdes Ogoulinguende, 
Alexandre Sambat, Leon Boyendou, Marc Saturnin Ma-Nguema, (Simon 
Oyono Aba), Leon Mebiane Mba, and (Divoungui) 
  Article 3. The results of the 5 December 1993 poll 
proclaimed on 13 December 1993 by the Constitutional Court have 
been confirmed.

  [Text] The day before yesterday there were reports of a 
murder attempt on Liberal Party [PL] Chairman Justin Mugenzi. 
Certain people said it had a political motive and that it was 
connected to divergences within the PL. 
  To competent observers however, the alleged murder attempt 
on 
Justin Mugenzi was just for show. After a close examination of 
the facts, one is hardly convinced that a real murder attempt 
took place. First of all, the news was announced that very 
evening by RTLM radio [FM station in Rwanda]. One is left to 
wonder how it was that the radio station was the first to 
broadcast the news in such a short period of time--the very 
evening of the murder attempt. 
  Secondly, it was said that the would-be criminal used a 
pistol in the murder attempt on Mugenzi's well-protected life. 
However, it is difficult to understand how one could lay an 
ambush with a pistol, especially against someone flanked by a 
bodyguard and inside a vehicle. 
  Finally, Radio Kigali said that there had been heavy 
shooting, whereas Mr. Justin Mugenzi's bodyguard said the 
criminal had fired three or four bullets after the vehicle left. 
  It is clear that it was just a performance to make the 
public 
believe that someone wanted to kill Justin Mugenzi for political 
reasons and to discredit his opponents. 
  It is worth recalling that Mr. Mugenzi is being manipulated 
by the president of the Republic, Juvenal Habyarimana, to delay 
the establishment of the broad-based transitional institutions.

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 23 (AFP)--Pressure from a population 
tired of fighting in Somalia is building a "momentum for peace" 
that could force the country's clan leaders into agreement, 
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Sunday [23 
January]. 
  "Sometimes the people want peace so badly that the 
politicians have to let them have it," said Evans, comparing the 
situation in Somalia with that in Cambodia before the 
implementation of a UN peace plan that he helped develop. 
  The minister, here on a one-day visit to visit Australian 
troops, said there were "visible developments that give ground 
for encouragement" in the political situation such as an 
agreement between rival clans and a peace festival Sunday 
attended by hundreds of thousands in the south of the city. 
  "The momentum for peace is developping in Somalia," Evans 
said, adding there was "evident pressure from below." 
  Rival Mogadishu leaders Mohamed Farah Aidid and the 
self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed have both 
signalled a willingness to reach agreement after years of 
ferocious rivalry that reduced the country to chaos and famine. 
  Evans also pointed to conciliatory comments made by three of 
Aidid's top officials after they were released from UN custody 
on Tuesday. 
  Osman Hassan Ali, the financier for Aidid's Somali National 
Alliance (SNA), called for an end to clan violence and a 
resumption of talks between his group and the UN operation in 
Somalia (UNOSOM). 
  The Australian minister met Aidid in the Kenyan capital 
Nairobi on Saturday and received assurances that the warlord 
supported moves by a Mogadishu religious leader to bring the 
faction together. 
  Aidid "did not discard a UN role in the transition in 
Somalia," Evan said. 
  Ali Mahdi, who heads an alliance of 12 clans, also told 
Evans 
during a meeting Sunday that he was willing to continue talks at 
the initiative of the Imam of Hirab. 
  "Ali Mahdi indicated a degree of flexibility in the position 
of the 12 and a general willingness to do what is necessary in 
order to achieve a result," Evans said.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has held 
talks with the Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and with the 
country's self-styled interim president, Ali Mahdi. Senator 
Evans says he is encouraged by what he heard during the meeting. 
He says pressure from the Somali population, which is tired of 
the fighting in the African nation, could also force the rival 
clan leaders into agreement. 
  Our correspondent, James Schofield, reports: 
  [Begin Schofield recording] Sen. Evans' surprise meeting 
with 
Aidid came at the end of a week-long visit to the Horn of 
Africa, during which Evans also discussed Somalia with the 
presidents of Ethiopia and Eritrea. But Evans said he had not 
come to broker peace, but will evaluate the situation in 
Somalia. Fears have been expressed that the withdrawal of U.S. 
troops by the end of March could return the country into 
anarchy. But Evans said his contacts with Aidid and Ali Mahdi 
were encouraging, and that Australia has no intention of pulling 
out its remaining service personnel just yet. [end recording]

  [Text] Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans says there 
is a growing momentum for peace in Somalia. Senator Evans made 
his comment during a one-day visit to Somalia where he held 
surprise talks with Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and rival 
Ali Mahdi. His visit comes as several other countries prepare to 
withdraw from the United Nations Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM]. 
But Senator Evans told James Schofield that Australia had no 
intention of pulling out. 
  [Begin recording] [Evans, in progress] Well, it is a 
slightly surreal experience to meet someone like General Aidid 
against the background of what has happened over last 12 months, 
but I had a long hour and a bit with him in Nairobi and I have 
met with Ali Mahdi here in Mogadishu. But I have to say that I 
am reasonably encouraged by the outcome of those discussions 
because if they are to be taken at face value, what they're 
saying is that they are both very much committed to consensus 
and compromise and there is plenty of objective evidence around 
the place that the pressures are building up for them to engage 
in such a consensual compromise approach. 
  [Schofield] What can you take at the face value? After all, 
wouldn't it suit Gen. Aidid's purpose, for example, to lay low 
until the Americans have gone? 
  [Evans] Well, all I can say is that there is a very 
widespread perception here being communicated to me by all sorts 
of people -- presidents of neighboring countries, UNOSOM 
personnel, others active [word indistinct] on the ground here -- 
that the people are really fed up to the teeth with the 
suffering that they have experienced and they are putting 
pressure on the political leadership of the respective clans to 
find this kind of accommodation. Each of them, I think, knows 
because of the messages they're getting loudly and clearly from 
the international community -- and I repeated those myself -- 
that they can't expect recognition and financial support or any 
other support from the international community if they win power 
by force of arms. They know that there is a huge relief and 
rehabilitation job still ahead of the country and the only way 
that is going to be achievable and they are going to keep their 
own popular support is by engaging in a process of political 
compromise. 
  [Schofield] When the U.S. pulls out they're going take most 
of the effective communications and, for example, casualty 
evacuation support services with them, which will 
considerably...which will leave the UN position considerably 
weaker, wouldn't you agree? 
  [Evans] Well, there will still be something over 20,000 
troops here and still very substantial backup for them and even 
in the worst case analyses in terms of other possible drawdowns 
of troop-contributor involvement, we're still talking about 
fifteen, sixteen thousand. I know that doesn't produce the 
capacity for really activist-interventionist military operation, 
that is still a pretty substantial security (?blanket). I mean, 
all sorts of things are possible where there is a will to 
achieve it in this situation. 
  All I can say generally in Somalia is that I had expected to 
find an absolute nightmare here. It is certainly not a dream 
run, but it is a better situation than what I had anticipated.

  [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has warned the people of 
Tanzania of the imminent danger of hunger in the country due to 
the prolonged drought. He urged them to be prepared for the 
difficult situation by conserving food. 
  The press secretary to the president, Mr. Patrick (Chokala), 
told the weekly briefing for journalists at the State House that 
serious efforts were being undertaken by the government to 
salvage the situation. Ndugu (Chokala) said that the current 
prolonged drought in Tanzania has brought about acute food 
shortage in many parts, including Moduli district, Arusha 
Region. Other regions that have food deficits include 
Shinyanga, Mwanza, Tabora, and Mara. President Mwinyi paid 
tribute to nongovernmental organizations such as the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in Tanzania, the Tanzania Red Cross Society, and 
the international organizations that are helping Tanzania out of 
its plight.

  [Text] Ouagadougou, 20 Jan (AFP) -- Five labor 
organizations today called on their members to mobilize to 
demand a substantial and immediate salary increase to replace 
the 4-10 percent increase announced by the government for 1 
April. 
  In a joint statement, the General Confederation of Labor, 
one 
of the country's six labor unions movements, and four 
independent labor unions of civil servants have deemed 
"ridiculous" this "timid increase" promised by the authorities 
to cushion the effects of the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
They described as "meaningless" the time period allowed for the 
implementation of the increase, since most of the prices for 
consumer goods did not wait until April to go up and since 
particularly, they stated, price control is an "illusion." 
  They also stressed the contradiction existing between the 
salary promises made by the government and the increases it 
authorized for imported rice -- 23.5 percent -- or for fuels -- 
38.6 percent. "The government has left us with only one option 
-- struggling to make our voices heard. It will assume full 
responsibility for what happens," the signatories to the 
statement said, calling on their members "mobilize to respond 
properly to the situation."

  [Text] Abidjan, 21 Jan (AFP) -- An agreement is "shaping 
up" between the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and Cote 
d'Ivoire for a three-year -- 1994-1996 -- plan as part of the 
consolidated structural adjustment facility, Michel Dessart, the 
institution's representative in Abidjan, announced to AFP. 
  Yesterday, the Ivorian authorities and an IMF delegation, 
which arrived 10 days ago, "positively" completed a first series 
of discussions on the letter of intention by which Cote d'Ivoire 
has called on the IMF to benefit from its resources, he stated. 
  "This first and very important stage, which has been passed, 
augurs well for the next ones," the IMF representative stated, 
adding that the letter of intention would be conveyed to 
Washington for "consideration and approval" by the fund 
management. 
  The IMF delegation, composed of five members and led by 
Christian Francois, senior adviser at the Africa Department, is 
expected to continue "in the days ahead" the negotiations with 
the Abidjan authorities on a "global document" taking stock of 
the country's economic situation and prospects. This document 
will be examined by the IMF management "in the weeks ahead," Mr. 
Dessart continued. 
  Neither the commitments made by the Ivorian authorities nor 
the amount of the resources requested were made public.

  [Text] In Cote d'Ivoire supporters of former Prime Minister 
Alassane Ouattara had to meet bad fortune with good hearts. 
Several hundred persons could not welcome the former Ivorian 
prime minister who was returning from Paris after three weeks' 
stay. Tight security was deployed yesterday around Abidjan 
Airport to prevent Alassane Ouattara's supporters from forcing 
their way through the airport. 
  [London BBC World Service in English at 0600 GMT on 23 
January in a related report adds the following: "In Ivory Coast, 
government forces, some armed with tear gas, have mounted a big 
security operation to prevent supporters welcoming home the 
former prime minister, Alassane Ouattara. The security forces 
blocked off access roads around Abidjan Airport, but about 100 
of Mr. Ouattara's supporters managed to step through the 
security cordon to give him an enthusiastic welcome on his 
return from France."]

  [Text] Ghana has appealed to the international community to 
make the Togolese authorities realize the dangers of reckless 
conduct and irresponsible accusations. Speaking to newsmen and 
members of the diplomatic corps in Accra today, the minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Assamoah, said henceforth any 
deliberate and unprovoked aggression will be met with 
commensurate response. 
  Tina Tehuda has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah expressed the 
government's concern about the recent events in Togo as well the 
tension on the Ghana-Togo border and used the occasion to refute 
the allegations against Ghana by the Togolese authorities. He 
referred to the accusations by the Togolese foreign minister, 
who said Togo had the right retaliate. Dr. Assamoah said Ghana 
is in no way interested in subverting Togo, with which it is 
bound by so many historical and ethnic links. He pointed out 
that the country is at present too preoccupied with her internal 
problems to get involved in what he called pointless foreign 
adventures. 
  [Assamoah] Each time there is violence in Togo, refugees 
streamed across the border in such numbers as to place an almost 
intolerable burden on our economy and create social and 
political problems. It would be foolish on our part, to 
instigate actions that are not in best interest of the country. 
It is rather illogical to state that Ghana is seeking to 
prevent the holding of parliament elections in Togo when it has 
itself embarked upon constitutional rule and has consistently 
stated its readiness to support the forces of genuine 
democratization in Togo. 
  [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah said Ghana still demands an apology 
and compensation from the Togolese authorities. He explained 
that if Ghana has so far refrained from responding in kind to 
the extreme Togolese provocations, it is out of anxiety to save 
the life of innocent civilians and to maintain international 
peace and security. 
  [Assamoah] There is, however, a limit to what Ghana can 
tolerate -- and Togo must take heed. Any deliberate and 
unprovoked aggression will be met commensurate response. We 
appeal to the international community to make the Togolese 
appreciate the dangers of reckless conduct and irresponsible 
accusations. May I conclude by stating clearly that Ghana has 
no interest in interfering in the internal affairs of Togo, and 
it is regrettable that the Togolese authorities should 
constantly seek to divert attention from the trouble at home by 
desperately trying to involve Ghana in their internal conflicts. 
I must emphasize that Ghana ensures that those Togolese who 
have been granted political asylum and refugee status in Ghana 
under international conventions abide strictly by the laws of 
the land. 
  We will deal firmly with anyone who abuses our hospitality. 
Ghana pledges to continue to maintain firm control over the 
border areas, to ensure that peace and tranquility prevail. 
  [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah said Togo's refusal to reopen her 
border with Ghana is causing hardship and tremendous economic 
loss to many ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] 
citizens. He advised the Togolese Government to seek solutions 
to its problems internally otherwise it unduly threatens the 
peace of the subregion and also saps energies which should go 
into nation building. [end recording]

  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has 
granted amnesty to some prisoners to commemorate the first 
anniversary of the Fourth Republic. Some condemned prisoners, 
who have served more than 10 years as at 7 January this year, 
are to have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The 
list excludes armed robbers convicted to death. Others to 
benefit from the amnesty are persons condemned to death for 
economic sabotage, who are to have their sentences reduced to 
fifteen years. 
  Some prisoners serving life imprisonment, who have served at 
least 10 years as at 7 January, are to have their sentences 
reduced to 20 years. This excludes armed robbers. Some 
prisoners serving sentences of 20 years and more, who have 
already served five years, are to have their sentences reduced 
by one-third. They exclude armed robbers and those convicted of 
drug trafficking and rape. A number of first and second 
offenders who have served half of their sentences are to be 
released on parole and would be obliged to undertake community 
service. The details will be implemented by the Ministry of the 
Interior. Those in this category do not include persons 
convicted for murder, manslaughter, rape, armed robbery, and 
drug trafficking. 
  A number of prisoners who are considered seriously ill and 
those sixty years of age are also to be released. This list 
excludes those serving sentences for rape, murder, manslaughter, 
armed robbery, and drug trafficking. 
  An official statement restated that the general amnesty 
granted to all Ghanaian citizens in voluntary exile outside the 
country is still open. The only exceptions are persons 
convicted of any criminal offense or declared wanted by the 
police for any criminal offense, and persons convicted and 
sentenced to death by any court or tribunal. It urged persons 
who wish to take advantage of the amnesty to apply to the 
minister of the interior or to the Ghanaian diplomatic mission 
nearest to their places of residence with the relevant 
information, including the date on which they left the country. 
It is noted that a number of persons have already taken 
advantage of the amnesty and returned home.

  [Text] Monrovia, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Liberia's interim 
government Friday [21 January] criticised the United Nations for 
deploying 300 military observers across the country without 
waiting for the arrival of the full West African peacekeeping 
force. 
  The deployment, which began on January 14 but only revealed 
Thursday by the United Nations, was "improper" and a 
contravention of last July's Cotonou agreement and UN 
resolutions, the government said. 
  Under the Cotonou accords, the UN Observer Mission in 
Liberia 
(UNOMIL) is to supervise the disarming of the warring factions 
by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] 
force. 
  The accords were signed by Charles Taylor's National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia, which began a bloody insurrection in 
December 1989, the interim government, the remnants of 
assassinated president Samuel Doe's army and the rival United 
Liberation Movement. 
  Taylor's NPFL had refused to disarm to ECOMOG, as agreed 
last 
year, arguing that it did not trust the Nigerian-led force in 
its original form. 
  Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe agreed to send some 2,550 
troops to boost ECOMOG, which first began operations in Liberia 
in August, 1990, but only 900 have so far arrived. 
  "The deployment of UN observers should be done in 
collaboration with ECOMOG which is responsible for the security 
of UNOMIL throughout the country," the government said.

  [Text] The Nigerian minister of internal affairs, Chief 
Alex Ibru, has said that the recent devaluation of the CFA 
franc, the currency used by French-speaking West African 
countries, will yield positive results for Nigeria. He told 
newsmen in Port Harcourt, Rivers State that since the 
devaluation of the currency the movement of goods from Nigeria 
to such countries had been on a decline. 
  Chief Ibru stated that the border patrol unit of his 
ministry 
was properly equipped to carry out surveillance of the nation's 
borders. He said that the devaluation would also lessen the work 
the Department of Customs and other units at the borders and 
reiterated his ministry's determination to effectively police 
the country's borders.

  [Text] Nigeria's head of mission in Benin Republic, Mr. 
Ayor Adigun, has called for an emergency meeting of the Economic 
Community of West African States, ECOWAS, to discuss the 
emerging economic changes in the subregion. Mr. Adigun, who was 
speaking in Cotonou, said that the meeting had become imperative 
in view of the recent devaluation of the CFA franc and other 
geopolitical changes in the subregion. The Nigerian envoy, who 
drew an analogy between the EEC and ECOWAS, pointed out that the 
imminent emergence of majority rule in South Africa, has made 
the EEC shift its focus toward that country. He also spoke of 
the need for ECOWAS member countries to highlight the things 
that were of mutual benefit to them. 
  Meanwhile, the transborder commercial activities between 
Nigeria and Benin Republic have reduced substantially following 
the January 12 devaluation of the CFA franc. A survey shows 
that the usual traffic congestion at the border town of Seme has 
dropped. The secondhand goods market across the border at Seme 
has been virtually empty [words indistinct].

  [Text] The minister of foreign affairs, Alhaji Babagana 
Kingibe, has said that the challenge before Nigeria today is how 
effective its diplomacy is in moving the country forward as a 
nation with a common destiny. 
  Alhaji Kingibe was speaking last night at an informal 
meeting 
with media representatives. Foreign news correspondent Candy 
Young Hari reports that the realization of this objective is a 
preoccupation of this ministry: 
  [Begin recording] [Hari] Alhaji Babagana Kingibe declared 
that he has come to the ministry with a clear idea as to the 
requirements of the job. But times, he said, require an 
effective background diplomacy following the national 
reconciliation that has so far been achieved since the debacle 
of 12 June. He said that the international community knows that 
under the circumstances which Nigeria found itself, there was no 
alternative to the change of government last November. The 
reaction of certain countries therefore is perhaps one of 
sadness rather than anger. Nevertheless, it is the 
responsibility of Nigerians to continue to explain that we can 
determine our future and have a right to expect their 
understanding of our endeavors. To do this, the minister said, 
he is prepared to assist the media to understand the issues 
involved. He appealed to media organizations to develop a 
relationship with his ministry based on knowledge and 
appreciation of the delicate nature of diplomacy. He urged 
media houses with the resources to create a corps of diplomatic 
correspondents in order to facilitate the suggestions. 
  [Kingibe] ...the combat of our diplomacy. I wish that such a 
corps existed. I think the handling of what is happening in 
Cameroon would have been different and would have been more 
supportive. Not that I am saying the coverages are not 
supportive. It is just like it is not informed, you know, of the 
reality of what is going on. That is really the problem. 
  [Hari] The reception was also attended by the minister of 
state in the ministry, Chief Anthony Ani, chief executives of 
media organizations, editors, and correspondents. [end

  [Text] President Mahamane Ousmane of Niger today arrived in 
Abuja on a two-day visit to Nigeria. Shortly after his arrival, 
the two governments held bilateral talks in the Presidential 
Villa. State House correspondent, Chris Ngu, reports on 
President Ousmane's first stay in Abuja. 
  [Ngu] The Nigerien [Nigerois] President was received on 
arrival by the head of state, General Sani Abacha, and top 
members of his administration, including the chief of general 
staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya and a number of 
ministers. The airport reception featured the traditional 
21-gun salute, a guard of honor inspected by the visiting head 
of state, and displays by Nigerian cultural groups. Bilateral 
talks were held behind closed doors. However, in the opening 
session just before the talks proper, head of state, Gen. 
Abacha, had said that Nigeria-Niger relations over the years 
could justify reference to Nigeriens as brothers. He said he 
looked forward to additional new ways of forging closer and more 
fruitful relations between both countries. 
  President Ousmane expressed similar hope as Gen. Abacha. He 
said the Niger-Nigeria relations have been reinforced over the 
years by geographical, historical, and cultural factors common 
to both countries. He said he hoped that the talks will help 
consolidate relations between the two countries. The outcome of 
the talks is yet to be made public. About now, a state banquet 
in honor of the visiting head of state should be taking place in 
Abuja. He is expected to return to his country tomorrow.

  [Text] The president of the Republic of Niger, Alhaji 
Mahamane Ousmane, flew back home today. He had led his 
country's delegation to bilateral talks with Nigeria at the end 
of which the two countries agreed to consolidate existing ties 
between the two countries. State House correspondent Chris Ngu 
has more on the bilateral talks: 
  [Begin recording] [Ngu] The talks featured a wide range of 
bilateral, regional, and international issues, according to a 
joint statement issued in Abuja today. Nigeria expressed 
support for the determination of the government of Niger to 
safeguard the territorial integrity of that country. In that 
regard, Nigeria commended ongoing efforts to end the armed 
rebellion in the northwestern part of Niger Republic. On the 
other hand, the Nigerien side commended efforts of the Nigerian 
Government at national unity and reconciliation. Niger 
considers peace and stability in Nigeria as inextricably linked 
with development and progress of the entire West African 
Subregion. The two leaders resolved to reinforce efforts of 
their governments to mitigate the effects on their peoples of 
the deteriorating international economic environment. Nigeria's 
Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Babagana Kingibe has more on 
other areas of cooperation agreed on at the talks: 
  [Kingibe] Specific areas of cooperation were considered to 
formalize cross-border trade and to enhance the unimpeded flow 
of goods and services. They further agreed to encourage private 
investments in each other's country and the formation of joint 
ventures. They therefore, directed that high level officials of 
the concerned ministries should immediately work out the 
modalities for effecting these decisions. In addition, the two 
leaders directed the joint commission to intensify its efforts 
in the implementation of its program of action, especially in 
the fields of agriculture, pest control, animal health, and 
management of water resources. The two sides reviewed progress 
in regional integration. They renewed their commitment to the 
realization of the objectives of ECOWAS [Economic Community of 
West African States] and the Abuja Treaty of African Economic 
Community. The two leaders exchanged views on a wide range of 
African and international issues and resolved to make concerted 
efforts to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security 
in Africa and the rest of the world. In this context, they 
expressed their full support to the OAU's newly established 
mechanism for the prevention and resolution of conflicts as well 
as the UN secretary general's agenda for peace. 
  [Ngu] The Nigerien head of state extended an invitation to 
General Sani Abacha to visit the Republic of Niger at a mutually 
agreed date. President Ousmane, who left the country this 
morning, was seen off at the airport by Gen. Abacha and top 
government officials. [end recording] 
  At a special dinner in honor of the Nigerien president in 
Abuja last night, Gen. Sani Abacha appealed to members of the 
Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, to implement 
the organization's protocol of cooperation as a way of removing 
existing barriers to development and free interaction of peoples 
in the subregion. Here is again is State House correspondent 
Chris Ngu with the report: 
  [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha, talking about 
cooperation at the subregional and African regional levels, said 
that success of ECOWAS would advance the drive toward attainment 
of the Abuja Treaty on African Economic Community. Much as, 
Gen. Abacha said, he considered development desirable in West 
Africa, he is of the view that economic development in the 
subregion cannot flourish until all conflict situations are 
responsibly managed. For that reason, he called on the warring 
factions in the Liberian crisis to implement the Cotonou Accords 
for peace in their country. Gen. Abacha noted with satisfaction, 
as he put it, the commitment of the leadership of Niger and 
Nigeria in satisfying the aspirations of peoples of both 
countries. He said that since coming to power, his 
administration has embarked on a determined course to create 
conditions for a stable and enduring nation. Referring to the 
recently established National Constitutional Conference 
Commission in Nigeria, Gen. Abacha talked about what he expects 
to follow from the commission's work: 
  [Abacha] As a result of the work of the conference, my 
administration hopes to leave for posterity a balanced and 
carefully drawn up framework for the governance of this country. 
We intend that it would be a framework which will guarantee to 
all Nigerians [words indistinct] liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness in a society, where the rule of law reigns supreme and 
justice will done and seen to be done to all. 
  [Ngu] Looking downward the African Continent, Gen. Abacha 
expressed satisfaction at political developments in South 
Africa, especially the recent decision of Mr. Clarence Makwetu 
and the Pan- African Congress of South Africa to call off its 
military activities and fully participate in the democratic 
elections scheduled for 27 April this year. He appealed to 
Chief Buthelezi and the Inkhata Freedom Party to show similar 
patriotism. He especially thanked the Nigerien Government for 
the role it played in ending the Nigerian Airways plane hijack 
with minimum risk of innocent lives. 
  President Ousmane, in his response to Gen. Abacha's address, 
commended Nigeria's efforts at promoting African unity. He 
referred to what he called Nigeria's preventive diplomacy 
strategy by which Nigeria is involved in many international 
peace missions and said Niger would emulate Nigeria in that 
regard. He said Niger's role in the Nigerian Airways' plane 
hijack was informed by his government's belief in upholding 
international diplomatic ethics. Nigerian cultural groups 
entertained guests. [end recording]

  [Text] The Nigerian Army training contingent in The Gambia 
is to stay on for another two years. The head of state, General 
Sani Abacha, approved this in Abuja today following a request 
for an extension by the Gambian external affairs minister, 
Alhaji Omar Sey. 
  Gen. Abacha told the visiting Gambian envoy that Nigeria 
would do its best to ensure the security of the West African 
subregion and Africa in general. He advised countries in the 
subregion to exploit the training facilities which Nigerian 
military institutions offer. 
  Alhaji Sey, who is in Nigeria with a message from the 
Gambian 
president, Sir Dawda Jawara, said Gambia supports Nigeria's 
ongoing democratization process. He expressed his country's 
appreciation for Nigeria's continued assistance in the areas of 
health, the judiciary, police, and prison services.

  [Excerpts] A ministerial team set up by the Federal 
Government to assess the problems and demands of the three major 
oil-producing states -- Delta, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom -- has 
completed the first phase of its tour. The team, which is 
headed by the minister of petroleum and mineral resources, Chief 
Don Etiebet, also includes the minister of internal affairs, Mr. 
Alex Ibru, and that of commerce and tourism, Chief Melford 
Okilo. Also on the team are representatives of the Oil and 
Mineral-Producing Areas Development Commission, the Federal 
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation. Addressing newsmen at the end of the 
tour of Rivers State at the Government House, Port Harcourt, 
Chief Etiebet said the team would also visit the other two 
states -- Delta and Akwa Ibom -- for a similar exercise. Energy 
correspondent Alex Udo, who was on the minister's entourage, has 
more on the story. 
  [Begin Udo recording] The ministerial team, which was 
conducted round the various oil-producing communities in Rivers 
State by the administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Dawda Komo, is to 
collate and document all the problems of the people in the 
affected areas. Chief Etiebet said the team was set up to find a 
solution to the frequent clashes between the oil-prospecting 
companies and their host communities. He said that after they 
had (?finished) the tour, government would come up with 
comprehensive and meaningful solutions to the constant clashes 
based on the team's recommendations. The minister pledged that 
the government would do everything possible to adequately 
address the problems of inadequate provision of basic amenities 
to the mineral [and] oil-producing communities. Chief Etiebet 
appealed to both the oil explorers and the various communities 
not to take the law into their hands. [passage omitted] 
  Chief Etiebet and the team also inspected some of the 
facilities of the oil-prospecting companies which were destroyed 
by indigenes of the communities during various clashes. [Words 
indistinct] where there was a communal crisis recently, members 
of the team were briefed by one of the community leaders, Mr. 
Ken Tarowiwa. He stressed the need for government to look into 
the frequent clashes, which he said resulted from the nonchalant 
attitude of some oil- prospecting companies to the needs of the 
rural communities. Mr. Tarowiwa however pledged the cooperation 
of the Ogoni people to the present administration. [end

  [Text] The Central Bank has revoked the licenses of two 
merchant banks. They are Financial Merchant Bank and Capital 
Merchant Bank. A statement by the Central Bank explained that 
the action followed a serious deterioration of the financial 
conditions of the two banks and a total erosion of their capital 
base. The statement said depositors' funds in the banks had 
dissipated resulting in their inability to meet their 
obligations to depositors and creditors. The liquidation of the 
two banks should be handled by the Nigerian Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.

  [Text] In another State House engagement, the heads of the 
joint World Bank and IMF team, who are on a familiarization 
mission in Sierra Leone, were yesterday received in audience by 
the chairman of the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council) 
and head of state, Captain Valentine E.M. Strasser. Presenting 
the envoys to the head of state, the secretary of state, 
finance, Dr. John Karimu, recalled that the joint World Bank and 
IMF team arrived in the country two weeks ago to assess and 
review the country's economic performance. 
  Responding, the IMF representative, Mr. Mike Novak, 
expressed 
satisfaction and informed the chairman that the economic 
performance and development targets of the country are right on 
track. He observed that within 18 months the NPRC government 
had reduced the inflation rate from 118 percent to less than 20 
percent -- a performance that has not been achieved by any 
developed economy. While noting that there is now an abundant 
supply of essential commodities and an absence of black 
marketeering, the envoy said the release of political detainees 
and the transition to democratic governing were vivid 
manifestation of government's tough and courageous measure to 
make sure that the targets of the structural adjustment program 
were on track. 
  Mr. Mike Novak expressed the hope that the rebel war would 
come to a steady conclusion so that military expenditure would 
be redirected to the purchase of civilian goods and other 
economic development programs. He assured Chairman Strasser 
that at the next conference of donors in Paris, France, Sierra 
Leone will be given positive consideration because of the 
country's present economic performance.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on AFrica" program] </F>
  [Text] Kenema District, eastern Sierra Leone, is on a full 
scale security alert at the moment. This follows a recent 
threat by the RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels of Foday 
Sankoh to infiltrate the town, and bearing in mind that the 
rebels launched an attack just 80 miles from the town itself not 
so long ago, the authorities are taking the threat very 
seriously. Victor Silver has been in Kenema. He is now back in 
Freetown from where he sent this report: [read by announcer] 
  Green tents have started dotting the Kenema township 
landscape as part of operation keep Kenema safe. The 
authorities have decided to take no chances. At six key points 
across town, tents are manned by both military and police 
personnel drawn from different sections of the two forces. Two 
days ago, an offer from members of the region's civil defense 
unit, known as Kamajowas or local hunters, to assist in the 
operation was accepted. Telephone hot lines to report any 
suspicious circumstances have not yet been established as in the 
capital, Freetown, but mobile and static patrols work on a 
24-hour basis. One top security officer told me that the 
emphasis is first to stop rebel-attempted infiltration. 
Secondly, to ensure that all soldiers are usefully engaged and, 
thirdly, to reduce the crime rate in Kenema town and its 
environs. 
  Given the recent spate of rebel attacks which came as close 
as 18 miles to the town, it would appear that the residents are 
taking nothing for granted. They remember the Kono takeover in 
1990-92 and they form themselves into defense units to combat 
any potential rebel threat. Life in Kenema is pretty normal, 
business is as usual but you have to be close to the security 
network to know that the military has thrown a ring of steel 
around the township as government forces go into operation in an 
area still occupied by rebels. One commander told me that the 
continued occupation of (Noma Farmer) area by rebels was his 
continuous nightmare and he predicted that once they were 
flushed from this area, the rebels would have no base in Sierra 
Leone. How soon this might be, he didn't say, but he believed 
the morale of government troops was very high and he said that 
even six soldiers are volunteering for frontline service.

  [Text] The president of the Republic, General Gnassingbe 
Eyadema, addressed the nation last night. It was on occasion of 
the opening of the electoral campaign for the legislative 
elections slated from 6 to 24 February. In his message, the 
head of state recalled the promise he made solemnly after his 
election as first president of the Fourth Republic to rally 
together all Togolese within the new democratic institutions. 
President Eyadema also recalled that the legislative election 
campaign should be the framework of a debate that would 
guarantee transparency in all proceedings. President Eyadema 
called on all sides taking part in the parliamentarian election 
to respect the freedom of one another, to abide by the principle 
of non-violence, and the acceptance of differences. 
  Recalling his responsibility as guarantor of national unity, 
the head of state called on voters and through them, on all 
Togolese to make their differences an asset and not a liability. 
He called on all sides to strictly abide by the rules of 
democracy and called on Togolese to contribute to the success of 
the legislative elections. 
  General Eyadema further said that Togolese were all equal 
before the laws of the Republic, laws that are imposed on them. 
The head of state recalled the consensus spirit that prevailed 
during the preparation of the vote and recalled the difficult 
trip of our country on the path towards democracy and that was 
marred by an unprecedented sociopolitical and economic crisis. 
He called on all Togolese to get down to work with courage and 
to work with a spirit of sacrifice in order to relaunch our 
country on the path of development. The head of state expressed 
his gratitude to the workers who, despite the difficulties from 
all fronts, continued to go to their work. That is why Gen. 
Eyadema called on all the sons and daughters of the country to 
initiate forgiveness and reconciliation and he then solemnly 
pledged to respect the will of the people, that is, to bow to 
the results of the forthcoming elections.

  [Text] Lome, Jan 23 (AFP) - Ghanaian-based "armed elements" 
opened fire on a border post between Lome and the Ghanaian town 
of Aflao late Saturday, a Togolese military source charged here. 
  The attackers, operating just hours before the start of a 
Togolese legislative election campaign, managed to escape in a 
mini- bus before soldiers could return fire, the source said, 
adding that no one had been injured in the shooting. 
  Elections are scheduled for February 6 and 20 and opposition 
parties have expressed fears that the poll will not be organised 
fairly. 
  Earlier this month 67 people were killed in fighting that 
broke out after an attack on Togolese President Gnassingbe 
Eyadema and the barracks where he has his official residence. 
  The government attributed the January 5 attack to opposition 
members in exile in neighbouring Ghana, who it alleged were 
being backed by Ghanaian authorities. 
  Ghanaian leaders have repeatedly denied the allegations and 
on Friday Ghana's foreign minister, Obed Asamoah, warned Togo 
that his country would retaliate if Lome continued to accuse 
Accra of supporting the assassination attempt. 
  "Any future deliberate and unprovoked aggression on Ghana by 
Togo will be met with a commensurate response," Asamoah warned 
during a meeting with diplomats and reporters. "There is an 
extent to which Ghana can be patient to these attacks by Togo."

  [Text] The president of the Republic, General Gnassingbe 
Eyadema, this afternoon held talks with Johnny Kwajo, charge 
d'affaires of the Ghanaian embassy in Togo. No details were 
given about the issue discussed by Gen. Eyadema and Mr. Kwajo. 
Their talks might not be unconnected with the shelling of our 
Aflao border post yesterday with gunfire from Ghana. The border 
post was shelled with automatic weapons. Togolese soldiers have 
received instructions not to return fire against any attack from 
that neighboring country.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the 
UN secretary general in Angola, today briefed the prime minister 
on the development of events in Lusaka. At the end of the 
meeting, Chief Beye told the press that everyone should pray 
that the peace talks have a good ending in the shortest possible 
time. 
  Marcolino Moco and Chief Beye met very briefly, considering 
the issues discussed at the meeting. In less than 30 minutes 
the special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola 
spoke about humanitarian assistance and explained to the prime 
minister how things are progressing in Lusaka. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Chief Beye, it 
must 
be true that your meeting with the prime minister centered on 
Lusaka peace talks? 
  [Beye] That is true. That is the concern of the Angolan 
people, and, therefore, the concern of the Angolan Government. 
I briefed the prime minister on our work. I also had the 
opportunity to reiterate to the prime minister my best wishes 
for 1994 and that this may be a year of peace for Angola. We 
also discussed the issue of humanitarian assistance which 
greatly concerns the government, the provision of supplies to 
the people, and the visit of the executive director of the World 
Food Program. 
  [Reporter] Will the peace talks still take long? 
  [Beye] We have to be very prudent. I must also respect the 
contract that we made. A day will come when I shall talk and I 
think this day will come very soon. We must, therefore, pray 
for this. Let us avoid predictions. 
  [Reporter] What is the deadline for the end of discussions? 
  [Beye] We cannot set a deadline for the end of negotiations. 
It must, however, be as soon as possible. Thank you very much. 
[end recording]

  [Text] Tomorrow, the Angolan Government and the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are expected 
to resume the second round of the Lusaka peace talks. Analysts 
say the talks may face some difficulties, because rumors are 
going around that UNITA intends to derail the negotiation 
process. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, 
is on the telephone to give us more details: 
  [Begin Ligio recording] It is three days now since 
Mulungushi 
Conference Hall has seen any activity in connection with the 
Angolan peace process. UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye closed the hall's doors and left for Luanda on yet 
another charity mission. However, his absence has not meant 
that the government and UNITA teams have been idle. Instead, 
they have been working at finding consensus concerning the 
operation of the future National Police. To keep the talks 
going, before leaving, the UN special representative handed over 
to the negotiators the theoretical formulas that are contained 
in a document regarded as the final draft in a bid to reduce the 
gap between the two sides. 
  Without meetings and without Blondin Beye constantly 
summoning them, the two sides now have more time to learn about 
the general situation (?in Angola), where the specter of war 
continues to loom large. Within this context, reports have been 
reaching Lusaka about certain developments on the battlefield. 
The effect of those reports has been to undermine the optimism 
that had marked these talks at one stage. 
  It is known that the UNITA leader has called an emergency 
meeting of the UNITA Political Commission. That meeting began 
on 21 January and it is not being attended by any of the 
officials in the team to the Lusaka peace talks. (?He) has also 
issued a communique in which Cubans and Russians are accused of 
holding talks with the Angolan Government concerning a return of 
Cuban military forces to Angola. That communique adds that UNITA 
will not make any concessions in connection with the Riot Police 
issue. Such developments are in clear contrast with what a 
reliable source in the Black Cockerel movement has said: He 
asked journalists here in Lusaka not to mix the country's 
internal developments with developments at the talks. According 
to that source, the main obstacles concerning the specific 
principles that will govern the future National Police have been 
overcome and the next 24 working hours could see an end to the 
existing deadlock over the percentages of men from both sides 
that will join the Riot Police. Should this be true, it will 
signal the end of discussions relating to point one in the 
second round of the Lusaka peace talks. 
  The UNITA communique came as no surprise to the Angolan 
Government team, whose officials believe that UNITA constantly 
resorts to such ploys when discussions concerning a point on the 
agenda are drawing to a close, particularly if the mediator is 
absent. 
  When asked whether the talks might break down as a result of 
these new developments, officials on both sides said they did 
not believe that would happen. Nevertheless, UN Special 
Representative Blondin Beye will have to work very hard to 
restore optimism to the talks, when he comes back. [end

  [Excerpts] Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his wife, First Lady 
Ana Paulo dos Santos, are at the head of the list of corrupt 
people in Angola. Reliable reports reaching our news desk today 
confirm that the Futungo de Belas couple is involved in cases of 
corruption and stealing Angola's wealth. 
  Those sources say that Jose Eduardo dos Santos is losing 
credibility in the international community because it has been 
found that he has great personal wealth and that he has links 
with corrupt Angolan figures. [passage omitted] 
  The international community has found that Eduardo dos 
Santos 
has property and large financial investments both in the country 
and abroad. The amounts in his coded bank accounts in Italy, 
Switzerland, and France are also known. 
  Ana Paulo dos Santos, his wife, is also involved in 
corruption. [passage omitted] 
  There are other threads to the Futungo de Belas web of 
corruption. They have been uncovered by the international 
community, which believes corruption in Angola can only have 
reached its present dimensions because the Angolan president is 
both involved and protecting others. Those sources say it is no 
accident that the best known figures involved in corruption are 
all proteges of and close to Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The names 
listed include Jose Leitao, who made a 30 percent profit in the 
recent $180 million weapons deal with Russia; Joao de Matos, 
currently Angolan Armed Forces chief of General Staff; Alberto 
Neto, head of an aviation company that works almost exclusively 
with the military sector; Norberto dos Santos, minister of 
assistance and social reintegration; Agriculture Minister Isaac 
dos Anjos; and Territorial Administration Minister Paulo 
Kassoma. [passage omitted] 
  Those sources added that other figures involved in Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos' web of corruption are: Finance Minister 
Emanuel Carneir, Deputy Petroleum Minister Desiderio Costa, and 
Noe Baltasar, Angola National Diamond Enterprise director 
general. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Talks may be under way in Lusaka, but the situation 
is one of war in northern Angola. Felix Miranda, the Voice of 
the Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] correspondent in 
that part of the country, the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, General Staff continues to involve 
regular forces in its offensive against National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  Last weekend, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] used its self-propelled artillery 
to shell an area northeast of Ucua, in Bengo Province, and the 
area of (Quicabo), north of Caxito. Those clashes were quite 
intense, killing more than 30 civilians, wounding dozens of 
people, and destroying homes. 
  Meanwhile, Americo Chivala, the Vorgan correspondent in 
Cabinda, has reported the presence of Cuban soldiers in the area 
of N'gange. Those soldiers are ready to come into action via the 
sea and to provide support to forces deployed on land. Our 
correspondent reports that those Cuban forces are artillery and 
military engineering experts. 
  It is worth noting that the Armed Forces for the Liberation 
of Angola [FALA] Northern Command last week inspected all units 
entrenched in Uige, Zaire, and Bengo Provinces. The FALA 
Northern Command promised people in those areas that its forces 
would do everything in their power to defend the lives and 
interests of the people. 
  It has also been reported that clashes have taken place in 
Huila Province. Vorgan correspondent Silva Aleluia reports that 
the MPLA-PT air force continues to carry out air raids against 
UNITA-controlled areas. Meanwhile, the FAPLA forces left the 
city of Lubango on 21 January in the direction of Cacula and are 
now waiting for reinforcements. Silva Aleluia also reports that 
the number of people killed as a result of shelling on 20 
January has now risen to 14. More than 20 people were seriously 
wounded. As in northern Angola, the FALA Huila Province Command 
has already taken the necessary passive and active measures to 
defend the people.

  [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the non-elected president 
of Angola, continues to organize the army for war. After the 
speech made by Marcolino Moco last Wednesday, it was Eduardo dos 
Santos' turn to reshuffle the army, the police, and navy for 
what he described as a national requirement for 1994. The 
reshuffle was undoubtedly a sign of return to belligerence when 
Angola is already very tired of war. Observers view his decrees 
as very troublesome.

  [Excerpt] While the Futungo de Belas government steps up 
its military operations and deploys personnel and war materiel 
for other offensives throughout the country, the strategy of the 
communist regime's news media is to present the victim as the 
aggressor. Over the past few days the media manipulated by 
Eduardo dos Santos alleged that the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola had attacked Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party positions in Cambambe. This 
has been categorically denied by the military command of the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola in Cuanza Norte. FALA 
forces stationed in that province have been strictly adhering to 
the cease-fire declared on 20 September 1993 by Army General Dr. 
Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, their supreme commander. [passage
