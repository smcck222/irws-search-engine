  [Excerpt] Malange Province is experiencing a serious 
political, military, social, and economic situation. Famine and 
insecurity are making the lives of people hell and they are 
trying to leave the city of Malange at all costs. Malange 
Provincial Governor Flavio Fernandes has described the situation 
in the following manner: 
  [Begin recording] [Fernandes] The political and military 
situation continues to be very serious in this province. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has 
increased its operations against the people. It has been mining 
paths which access farming areas and it has been abducting and 
ambushing people. Furthermore, UNITA has also carried out 
several raids on strategic parts of the city to destroy 
infrastructure. We can say that we have practically not had a 
single day without fighting. To us, therefore, the situation 
continues to be very serious and we are doing everything in our 
power to change it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could you comment on social 
conditions here? 
  [Fernandes] Well, the people continue to experience a very 
serious situation. We are going through a time of serious 
famine. You, the correspondents, who have taken the care to 
visit the distribution centers, know we are experiencing high 
levels of serious malnutrition, running at about 34.5 percent. 
[sentence as heard] These days, and in our modern world, such 
figures are inadmissible. 
  [Reporter] Are there any plans to turn the problem around 
and 
ensure that people do not have to survive on aid grants? 
  [Fernandes] Yes. In addition to the work that we are doing 
with nongovernmental organizations and the international 
community, we are working with UNICEF and plans were recently 
approved concerning an estimated $2 million in aid for children. 
We are also preparing our proposals, which will obviously be 
included in the government's plan of action. 
  [Reporter] While that does not happen, though, people will 
have to continue living on humanitarian aid? 
  [Fernandes] Unfortunately, that is the case. I must tell you 
frankly that we have had very little support from the central 
government so far. Basically, we are surviving on international 
aid. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, 
FALA, Command and the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola, UNITA, secretariat for Malange Province have 
vehemently rejected the remarks made by Flavio Fernandes, 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, governor for that province. Those two structures have 
described the MPLA-PT governor's words as thoughtless. 
  Fernandes, who was interviewed in Luanda yesterday, 
described 
Malange Province's political and military situation as serious 
because of an alleged intensification of the attacks by the 
UNITA troops. According to him, those forces were also planting 
mines along access routes to farming areas used by the people. 
  That MPLA-PT official has dared to show himself a faithful 
defender of the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership's interests. 
He made defamatory remarks about things that are not even 
happening. He even failed to notice when he confessed the truth 
by saying that Malange Province's difficulties owed to a large 
extent to a lack of support by the Luanda regime. [passage

<F P=106> [Joint communique from the National Bank and the National </F>
Police General Command issued on 20 January] 
  [Text] 1. In accordance with Article 39 and Law No.5/91 of 
20 April, published in the GAZETTE OF THE REPUBLIC No.16, first 
series, all those violating the law and orders or instructions 
from the Angolan National Bank could be sentenced up to two 
years in prison and fined 5 million new kwanzas, apart from 
other appropriate measures which could include a total ban on 
exercising activities in any financial institution. 
  2. The Angolan National Bank has been issuing some notices 
which could be viewed as government decrees. They contain norms 
and instructions which must be carried out. These include 
Notice No. 6/92 of 12 August, which defines conditions for 
opening foreign exchange offices and institutions whose 
exclusive objective is to carry out the purchase and sale of 
foreign currency and travelers checks; Notice No. 8/93 of 27 May 
which authorizes commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange 
offices to purchase and sell foreign currency at the free market 
rate; Notice 11/93 of 16 December, which establishes forms in 
which commercial banks must carry out these operations; as well 
as Notice No.12/93 of 16 December which clarifies regulations to 
be observed by commercial banks in their foreign exchange 
operations at free market rates. 
  3. The purchase and sale of foreign currency can only be 
legally carried out by institutions which have been duly 
authorized by the Angolan National Bank, which is exclusively 
charged with the task of providing license for this activity. 
Also in force is Notice No.6/93 of 12 August, which contains 
necessary prerequisites for the provision of licenses to foreign 
exchange offices. 
  4. Necessary conditions have, therefore, been created for 
the 
legal operation of the foreign exchange activity. It will not 
be justifiable, therefore, to carry out this business outside 
the legal perimeters, as has been the case on the streets and 
other unsuitable places, endangering public order and the 
personal security of the people involved in it. 
  5. Thus, the Angolan National Bank and the National Police 
General Command announce that in terms of the authority 
conferred on them by law they will deal with all those engaged 
in the illegal purchase and sale of foreign exchange or 
travelers checks. They, therefore, advise them to stop this 
activity at once. 
  [Signed] Generoso de Almeida, governor of the Angolan 
National Bank, and Santana Andre Pitra Petroff, National Police 
general commander.

  [Excerpt] The World Bank is to make available $7 million to 
help rehabilitate Lobito Harbor, which is currently facing many 
problems. However, the management of the country's largest 
harbor is determined to get over those problems as rapidly as 
possible. 
  The year of 1994 offers Lobito commercial harbor new 
prospects because the blockade [bloqueio] which was in force 
between April and August of last year has now been lifted. Only 
800 ships docked at that harbor in 1993, but it is expected that 
those figures will double by the end of this year. The 
management of Lobito Harbor has already been given permission to 
open an account with Totta e Acores Bank so it can manage its 
foreign currency earnings with complete autonomy. This is what 
Lobito Harbor Director Carlos Gomes had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Gomes] There is some optimism now because 
the World Bank has made available a certain amount of money to 
see if we can deal with these problems as urgently as possible. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How much has it made available? How 
much? 
  [Gomes] It has made available $7 million, but we know how 
the 
World Bank operates: now, there is still bound to be some red 
tape and there will be other difficulties before the money gets 
here. 
  [Reporter] You did say it was $7 million? 
  [Gomes] Well, what I am pinning my hopes on is that there 
will be more ships docking here to see if we can consolidate our 
gains by our own means, thereby getting shipowners and shipping 
agencies to deposit currency in the bank we have indicated. [end

foodstuffs from the European Union. Caritas Sources say that 
the aid comes at an opportune time and the goods will 
immediately be distributed to the needy population in the 
Luanda, Malanje, Menongue, Huambo, Uige, M'banza Congo and Sumbe 
areas. Meanwhile, Caritas is one of the few humanitarian 
organizations which distributes donations to all Angolans 
without political or ethnical discrimination. Other 
organizations, which claim to be impartial, have been showing 
that their sole aim is to supply areas controlled by the Luanda 
regime.

  [Text] Comoran President Mohamed Said Djohar should go. 
The Comoran opposition in France reiterated this call at a 
rally in Paris yesterday afternoon. At the end of the rally, 
the opposition spokesman in France, Abdallah Ahmed Mohamed, 
talked to reporter Youssoufou Saliou Mohamed: 
  [Begin Mohamed recording] This rally was necessary because 
an 
important document was published in Moroni on 17 January by all 
Comoran opposition parties grouped into a forum for national 
redress. This forum clearly and loudly asked President Djohar 
to step down and today we want to sensitize the entire Comoran 
community to that fact. All the people invited to this rally 
agreed to come in great numbers in order to demand the 
resignation of the head of state, to fight for the respect of 
the principle of human rights and democratic liberties as well 
as the establishment of a genuine law-abiding state. 
  President Djohar along with his son-in-law, (Mshangama), 
will 
miss no occasion to violate the principles of the Constitution. 
Moreover, President Djohar's son-in-law, (Mshangama), maneuvered 
to be elected and undertook a true coup de force to be elected 
speaker of the National Assembly. Right at this moment, many 
opponents are imprisoned and this is the case of a 
parliamentarian who was regularly elected in the first round of 
the legislative elections at (Moutamoudou), namely Mr. Ahmed 
Mohamed. We believe that this wave of arrests is a serious 
breach of human rights principles and one of the main grievances 
of the opposition today is the demand for the immediate and 
unconditional release of all political prisoners. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] After something of a lull, there has been more 
gunfire this afternoon in Lesotho's capital, Maseru. For more 
than a week opposing factions of the army have been clashing 
since a group of soldiers demanded a big pay raise. Some said 
it was a front for a coup against the elected government of 
Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle. It was serious enough for UN 
Special Representative in Mozambique Aldo Ajello to be called in 
for talks with the government and the commanders of the opposing 
army groups, but already there has been more shootings. On the 
line to Maseru, Josephine Hazeley asked Mamelo Maurison of 
(MPHATALATANI) newspaper what was going on. 
  [Begin recording] [Maurison] A little after 5 o'clock [1500 
GMT] our time there were gunshot reports from the area of the 
mountain which is occupied by the faction of the army which is 
alleged to be pro-government, and the day had been relatively 
quiet until then. 
  [Hazeley] How heavy were the shellings from where you are? 
  [Maurison] I was still walking out of the center of town and 
the shelling was very heavy, so heavy that people all around, we 
started sort of quickening up, and one was aware that there was 
general concern and anxiety on the faces of people who were on 
the streets then. 
  [Hazeley] As we speak, is it still going on, the selling? 
Can you tell? 
  [Maurison] As we speak it has not been going on, at least 
for 
the last 45 or 50 minutes it has not been going on. 
  [Hazeley] Who was this attack aimed at? Is there any 
indication? 
  [Maurison] I couldn't tell where it was going to, except 
that 
one could only guess that shots from that end have been aimed at 
the other faction at Makoanyane barracks, so I just guess that 
it may have been directed at Makoanyane. 
  [Hazeley] Did you see or have you heard any reports of 
anybody being injured or property being damaged? 
  [Maurison] No, no, I haven't heard anything about anybody 
being injured or anything about that today. 
  [Hazeley] You said it happened at 5 o'clock local time, or 
around 5 o'clock local time. Has the government said anything 
on their national radio yet? 
  [Maurison] Not that I am aware of as of now. There will be a 
broadcast of the local news, we are expecting to hear something 
from the government radio then. [end recording]

  [Text] A soldier has been killed in Maseru in renewed 
fighting between opposition factions in the Lesotho Army. This 
brings to three the number of Lesotho soldiers killed since 
fighting between the factions broke out a week ago. 
  In another incident a former soldier stabbed a prison warden 
to death during an argument. 
  Our correspondent in Lesotho reports that the situation in 
the country appears to be normal although there have been 
sporadic clashes between the two factions.

continuing. Residents of the Lesotho capital say it is not 
clear where the fighting is taking place. The two opposing 
military factions are apparently firing on each other from 
hillocks outside the city. The clashes broke out about a week 
ago after the government refused to grant a demand for a 100 
percent salary increase by one of the military groups.

Maseru or its surrounding areas because of the renewed fighting 
between rival Lesotho military factions which broke out there 
this morning. Diplomats say it is difficult to obtain a clear 
picture of what is happening, but troops from the Makoanyane 
Barracks on the outskirts of the capital are believed to have 
launched an attack on the defense force headquarters in Maseru. 
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha is being kept well 
informed on the situation.

  [Text] Maseru Jan 23 SAPA -- The Lesotho capital of Maseru 
was rocked by automatic gunfire and bomb blasts early on Sunday 
morning as confrontation continued between two factions in the 
country's Royal Lesotho Defence Force. Residents huddled in 
their homes and listened to sporadic gunfire, which started on 
the outskirts of the city at 6AM. 
  In repeated broadcasts, the state-controlled Radio Lesotho 
warned residents of several villages near army barracks at 
Makoyane and Ratjomodise to stay indoors to avoid stray bullets. 
One Radio Lesotho announcer told people to pray for peace. 
  Radio Lesotho also invited leaders of all political parties 
to meet a high-powered organisation of African Unity Delegation 
at the offices of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle in Maseru at noon 
on Sunday. The OAU mission arrived in Maseru on Saturday as part 
of an international mediatory attempt to defuse the situation. 
  The unrest began when a section of the army demanded a 100 
per cent salary increase with a deadline on Monday. Many of 
these dissatisfied men support the Basuto National Party which 
lost last year's elections to the Basutholand Congress Party. 
  Political observers believe the salary increase demand was a 
smokescreen and that the real cause of the army confrontation 
was politically motivated. 
  Meanwhile, an international soccer match between Lesotho and 
Reunion in the Africa series due to kick off at 3PM on Sunday 
has been cancelled until further notice because of the unrest.

  [From the "News Brief" program] 
  [Text] [Presenter Patricia Glynn] The situation in Lesotho 
is 
reported to be quiet but tense today after a weekend of fighting 
between army factions. We are joined now by a correspondent in 
Maseru, Sara Hildebrand. Sara, welcome to you. You have been 
through quite a weekend. How has the fighting affected you? 
  [Hildebrand] For me personally, well, it's very difficult. I 
do sympathize with any the other people living in Lesotho with 
young families. I've got two small children. There is 
definitely a worry here about what to do. The are queues, 
apparently, at the border with people leaving, and people coming 
into Lesotho are being told they do so at their own risk. 
  [Glynn] But, the fighting over the weekend, was it in the 
center of Maseru, or on the outskirts? 
  [Hildebrand] It was basically -- we have a hotel up on the 
hill and it was certainly round the surrounding houses, and then 
on the other side we have a place called [word indistinct] in 
Thetsane where there was also shelling going on there, you know, 
where people were really, literally, crouching under the tables 
and there was just whistling over their homes. In fact my 
gardener came in this morning to tell me he opened his front 
door this morning to find two dead soldiers outside in the 
garden. 
  [Glynn] What are the total casualties to date? 
  [Hildebrand] Well, it's very difficult to say. There have 
been reports of two or three soldiers, which obviously, I think 
that not actually accurate, as I've heard from various other 
sources of people seeing seven soldiers at the side of the road, 
and I think we are very unsure about that. 
  [Glynn] And the consensus of opinion now as to the cause of 
the fighting -- are people still believing that it is the wage 
issue? 
  [Hildebrand] I think it's sort of gone beyond that now. It 
might have originally been that, but it's certainly between 
these two rival factions. And again people are climbing on the 
bandwagon here, the political seems to be getting involved as 
well. [sentence as heard] We have the troops in the town who 
are supposedly loyal to the government, and then those outside 
who again may be [words indistinct] supported by the BNP 
[Basotholand National Party]. 
  [Glynn] We heard reports that South Africa's been requested 
for troops to quell the fighting there. Do you have an update 
on that situation? 
  [Hildebrand] I have been trying to get in contact with the 
South African ambassador, but he's obviously in various meetings 
at the moment, but he's promised to get back to me as soon as 
possible. 
  [Glynn] And what about your plans? I mean, what's going to 
happen today, for instance? 
  [Hildebrand] I think that's a very good question. We are all 
waiting here, really. We are expecting it to start up again. I 
mean, you know there's a lull at the moment but the soldiers are 
all still out there. I think everyone has to make their own 
decision about what they are going to do. Some areas have been 
evacuated, those in the direct line of fire, and I know friends 
of mine have now moved into the safer areas. I think we've just 
got to wait and see how bad it's going to get. Certain people 
have moved across the border already. I know the United Nations 
have moved their people out. So, I mean, I think everyone had 
to make up their own minds on this [ words indistinct]. 
  [Glynn] And your bags are packed? 
  [Hildebrand] They are definitely packed and we are ready to 
go, but we are sticking in here for the moment. 
  [Glynn] But Sara, are there any plans for negotiations, any 
meetings planned for today? 
  [Hildebrand] I hope so, yes I do. As I say, I am waiting to 
see that. Some people obviously are in meetings at the moment. 
I know, for instance, the Lesotho Highlands Project is now 
closed down. They just rang in to tell me that. The people are 
being sent home. 
  [Glynn] Well, take care of yourself, Sara, and thanks very 
much for joining us.

  [Text] Reports from Lesotho say the streets of the capital, 
Maseru, were quiet this morning after fierce gunfire and mortar 
exchanges yesterday between rival army factions. Diplomats 
attributed the lull in the fighting to heavy overnight rains, 
but said they believed the factions were still holding their 
positions. 
  Meanwhile South Africa's foreign minister, Mr. Pik Botha, 
has 
ruled out his country's immediate military intervention in 
Lesotho, where rival army groups have been engaging in sporadic 
fighting for the past 10 days. This follows an appeal by 
Lesotho's prime minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, to President 
Frederick de Klerk to send in a peace keeping force to help 
stabilize Lesotho. But in a radio interview in Johannesburg 
today Mr. Botha said while South African troops had been asked 
to keep a close watch on the border in case of a spill over 
effect, there were no immediate plans to cross into Lesotho. He 
said the sending of troops to Lesotho would reduce the number of 
security forces which are needed more inside South Africa. He 
said in the meantime he had sent reports to the secretary 
generals of the United Nations, the Commonwealth, and 
Organization of African Unity to make sure they realize the 
situation may deteriorate and may eventually end up as another 
Somalia.

  [Text] The government of Botswana has strongly appealed for 
peace and restraint in Lesotho following a bloody unrest in the 
Royal Lesotho Defense Force. In a statement the Department of 
Foreign Affairs says the split in the ranks of the royal Lesotho 
force has created a situation which threatens the peace and 
security of the Basotho nation. 
  It further says the government of Botswana has been watching 
the unfolding situation in Lesotho with grave concern, adding 
that this critical situation resulting from the unrest within 
the armed forces of Lesotho also threatens the stability of the 
democratically elected government of Lesotho. 
  While pleading for restraint throughout the Basotho nation, 
the Government of Botswana strongly appealed to the Royal 
Lesotho Defense Force to restore the situation to the status quo 
for the honor and dignity of the sister people of Lesotho. It 
applauds the efforts of the secretaries general of the 
Organization of African Unity, and the Commonwealth, to bring 
the situation in Lesotho back to normal.

  [Text] The Subcouncil of Foreign Affairs in the 
Transitional Executive Council in South Africa says it supports 
all endeavors, including those of South Africa, to diffuse the 
present military crisis in Lesotho. A statement from the 
subcouncil says the international community should be alerted to 
the threat posed to the democratically elected government of 
Lesotho. 
  The subcouncil says any attempt to replace Lesotho's 
democratic government by force will not be acceptable to South 
Africa, and the president of the African National Congress, Mr. 
Nelson Mandela, and various foreign governments, have expressed 
their support for the present government of Lesotho. It said 
the involvement of the United Nations secretary general, the 
South African Government, and the Commonwealth was welcome to 
the subcouncil. The subcouncil concluded by saying it will also 
welcome the monitoring of the situation in Lesotho and a strong 
South African military and police presence on the border between 
Lesotho and South Africa.

  [Text] Maseru Jan 24 SAPA -- Business returned to normal in 
Maseru on Monday, the day after artillery and mortar rounds 
rocked the Lesotho capital as two military factions clashed. 
Radio lesotho reported the CAF [Confederation of African 
Football] cup first leg preliminary round soccer match between 
Lesotho's Linare and Reunion's St Denis, cancelled earlier, 
would be played at the national stadium in the Mountain Kingdom 
capital at 7pm on Monday. 
  A SAPA correspondent said shops in downtown Maseru were 
open, 
and the nearby border post, which was closed on Sunday, was 
operating again and commercial traffic was flowing. 
  Supermarkets and cafes were closed on Sunday and no 
newspapers were available because of the closed border post. 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio said the 
Education Ministry had ordered schools, due to open for the 
first day of the year on Monday, to remain shut. 
  South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Awie Marais said 
Sunday's fighting ended with heavy overnight rain storms, adding 
the two factions were maintaining their positions. He described 
the Mountain Kingdom capital as tense. 
  But Maseru businesses were open in light drizzle on Monday, 
the SAPA correspondent said. 
  News reports said five soldiers were killed and at least 
four 
civilians injured in fighting which began about 10 days ago. 
  Government officials and diplomats have been unable to 
explain the cause of the dispute between the two military 
factions.

  [Text] On 18 January the government withdrew troops it had 
deployed in the Sangage settlement of Nampula Province's Angoche 
District in June 1993. Our Nampula correspondent says the 
withdrawal was ordered by the regional Cease-Fire Subcommission 
following a decision made by the Cease-Fire Commission. [CCF] 
The withdrawal was supervised by the United Nations and 
monitored by government and Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] representatives. 
  The troops were deployed in Sangage by the Angoche District 
Military Command. A communique issued by the regional 
Cease-Fire Subcommission says the decision to deploy the troops 
was designed to ensure order as Renamo moved its forces in the 
area. Meanwhile, Major Mario Semo, head of the government 
delegation to the CCF- Northern Region, said Sangage has never 
been disputed by the government or Renamo.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been a good week for the peace process in 
Mozambique. Recently, the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] 
government came under intense criticism from both the opposition 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] movement and the UN 
representative in Mozambique for not sending its troops into the 
UN assembly areas as fast as the former rebels of Renamo were 
doing. But now it seems the government is at last getting its 
act together, as Barnaby Philips reports from Maputo. 
  The movement of government soldiers into UN assembly areas 
increased dramatically over the last week. Since last Monday, 
1,500 Frelimo troops have arrived in assembly areas across the 
country, compared to a mere 60 in the first two weeks of 1994. 
Many UN observers, who had been twiddling their thumbs in 
previously deserted assembly areas, finally had some work to do, 
as the first Frelimo troops showed up. 
  Aldo Ajello told a Maputo press conference yesterday that he 
was satisfied with the speed with which government forces were 
assembling. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama had threatened to 
paralyze the peace process unless he had received an explanation 
by today from President Chissano as to what was going on. In 
the light of the improved situation, that threat seems to have 
been quietly forgotten, but as so often in the Mozambican peace 
process, it is a case of two steps forward, one step back. 
  Today, the problem of funding for Renamo resurfaced. Afonso 
Dhlakama told the first edition of the independent SAVANA 
newspaper that money that had been promised to Renamo by the 
international community to assist the former rebels as they 
attempt to transform themselves into a political party was still 
not forthcoming. Dhlakama laid down another ultimatum: If there 
is no money by February, he told SAVANA, Renamo will not contest 
the elections. In the past, Dhlakama's bark has proved worse 
than his bite. The donors meeting in Maputo on Monday will 
[words indistinct] bear his words in mind.

  [Text] Mozambique and Malawi have agreed to a program 
relating to the repatriation of the so-called Malawi Young 
Pioneers, MYP, from Mozambican territory. That program, which 
is to be implemented as soon as possible, was approved at a 
meeting in Maputo of the technical subcommission of the Joint 
Mozambique-Malawi Defense and Security Commission. According to 
a note received today, that program is to be analyzed during the 
sixth Joint Mozambique-Malawi Defense and Security Commission 
session to be held in Maputo at a date yet to be determined. 
Some Malawian newspapers reported that those MYP youths were 
staying at a Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, base in 
Zambezia Province.

  [Excerpt] Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Balasso Anastacio, 
military commander for Cabo Delgado Province, has prevented 
media professionals from visiting troop confinement points. 
Such behavior is in clear violation of the Law on the Press. 
Radio Mozambique reporter Emilio Manhique visited Cabo Delgado 
Province's Montepuez District last week and he was not allowed 
to visit government troop confinement areas. 
  [Begin Manhique recording] It is true that I went to 
Montepuez last week to tour northern region troop assembly 
points. Though I was carrying the necessary identification, 
including UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, credentials, I 
was not allowed to visit the troop confinement center. I was 
not even allowed to talk with the soldiers. 
  Center Commander Major (Babe) showed me an order issued by 
radio whereby Lt. Col. Daniel Balasso Anastacio, military 
commander for Cabo Delgado Province, gave instructions that no 
journalist should be allowed to interview, film, or visit the 
premises where the government troops are confined. 
  I was surprised, but I tried to convince Maj. (Babe) that 
such an order was at least nonsensical. Maj. (Babe) 
categorically replied that orders are orders and that he was 
there to carry them out. Nevertheless, he agreed to establish 
radio contact with the Cabo Delgado Provincial Command to report 
my presence. The Provincial Command did not budge. 
  Then, I proceeded to contact the Unomoz forces stationed at 
the center and it was enough for me to identify myself to get 
all the information I needed. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Windhoek January 21 SAPA -- Cuban Foreign Affairs 
Minister Roberto Robaina, a veteran of the Angolan war, said on 
Friday his time spent fighting with the MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola] and SWAPO [South-West African 
People's Organization] against UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] and the SA Defence Force was one 
of the most important experiences of his life. He was a soldier 
near the Namibian border from April 1988 to April 1989 when 
Cuban forces went home at the implementation of UN Resolution 
435 that ushered in Namibian independence. 
  Mr Robaina denied reports from Zambia that claimed he said 
Cuba would again send troops to Angola in the event of foreign 
intervention on the side of the UNITA rebels, saying Havana had 
too many domestic difficulties to even consider it. He said the 
overnight disappearance of Cuba's traditional economic relations 
with the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries had left his 
Caribbean island in serious economic difficulty. 
  Speaking in Windhoek at the tail end of a six-nation African 
tour, he cited ongoing "irrational persecution" and a trade 
blockade by the United States as a key factor in Cuba's strained 
financial status. There was no sign of any flexibility from the 
Clinton administration, he said, adding that Cuba was having to 
undergo a policy transformation in order to survive in a changed 
world. 
  U.S. pressure was creating problems for eight in every ten 
international firms which tried to establish themselves in Cuba, 
Mr Robaina said. 
  He said he was confident about a succesful conclusion to the 
Angolan peace talks dragging on in Lusaka, and hoped for a 
"happy ending" to the Angolan conflict. 
  During his visit to Namibia, Mr Robaina concluded a visa 
exemption agreement and a trade pact which he said would further 
consolidate relations between the two countries. Cuba is 
expected to participate in Windhoek's international trade fair 
in April, and has invited Namibia to reciprocate in Havana in 
November. 
  Introducing the Cuban on Friday, Namibian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Netumbo Ndaitwah said relations between Namibians and 
Cubans were "sealed in blood".

  [Text] National Party [NP] leader F.W. de Klerk's road show 
in the future north west province ended on a slightly 
controversial note today. On entering the Vryburg show grounds 
where an NP rally was held, a number of black farm workers were 
handed 10-rand notes. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Mr. de 
Klerk's target group in this traditional CP [Conservative Party] 
country were black and colored South Africans. At mostly closed 
meetings during the last three days, he made contact with more 
than 12,000 people. Like yesterday farm laborers were bussed in 
to today's rally. Eyebrows, however, were raised when farmer 
Mr. Ben Schoonwinkel gave 30 of his workers 10 rands each. 
  [Schoonwinkel, in Afrikaans] I only gave them the 10 rands 
in 
advance -- they are getting paid next week -- so that they could 
buy food. 
  [Van Zyl] Other farm laborers denied that they received 
money 
to attend the rally. 
  [Unidentified laborer, in Afrikaans] No, I was not paid 
today 
to come here. I came on my own. 
  [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk later rejected allegations of 
bribery, 
as well as claims by a handful of ANC [African National 
Congress] supporters that they were refused entry to the show 
grounds. 
  [De Klerk] We didn't bribe anybody, and we didn't refuse 
anybody. 
  [Van Zyl] Turning to a favorite electioneering theme, 
intimidation, Mr. de Klerk said he had been invited to black 
townships, but was advised against it. 
  [De Klerk] It is apparent that the ANC has a strategy to 
make 
certain areas inaccessible to us. 
  [Van Zyl] This was the first of many campaigns for Mr. de 
Klerk. He faces a grueling schedule -- at least one road show a 
week -- until the watershed day in April. 
  [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] At another NP rally, this time 
in Eldorado Park south of Johannesburg, the party's election 
machine ran into noisy protests from ANC and Azapo [Azanian 
People's Organization] supporters. After Government chief 
negotiator Roelf Meyer made his way past a small group of irate 
demonstrators, the protesters proceeded into the hall where 
speakers were interrupted continuously. National Party 
supporters voiced their dismay with the presence of the 
intruders and drove the demonstrators from the hall. Mr. Meyer, 
whose speech was also interrupted, drew cheers from the new NP 
supporters when he dealt with the issue. 
  [Meyer] They can also say what they want like they do this 
[as heard]. And there's nothing to be noisy about. They can 
quietly do it. They can hold their own meetings, and we will 
tolerate them to have their own meetings. 
  [Alfonso] No serious incidents were reported, but Mr. Meyer 
opted to leave the building through a side door while protesters 
waited for him at the main entrance. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Norman Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Rustenburg, Western Transvaal, Jan 21 SAPA--Forget 
casspirs and campari. It were gymslips, heckling, and corn on 
the cob for President FW de Klerk on his "beer bus, balloons 
bonanza" election trip through Western Transvaal on Friday [21 
January]. 
  In Rustenburg, taking a presidential stroll down the street, 
he was heckled by African National Congress [ANC] supporters. 
  But at the Dwarsfontein farm near Ventersdorp, he strolled 
down a dirt road hand-in-hand with black children, and later 
enjoyed sizzling hot cob on the corn prepared while he had been 
making his speech. 
  At Rustenburg, Mr de Klerk dropped into the National Party 
[NP] offices, situated near a gym, where he had a quick work-out. 
  Slender bimbos capable of dethroning many an international 
beauty queen leisurely bided their time in the narrow Rustenburg 
Street where the gym is situated, giving passersby the lazy eye 
treatment. 
  Later that evening, Mr de Klerk addressed a banquet attended 
by both black and white guests at the Eben Marais Hall. 
  Shouts of "Viva, NP, Viva" reverberated through the hall, 
the 
white guests casually adapting themselves to the changed 
political circumstances. Anyone shouting "viva" a few years ago 
was likely to become the object of intense security police 
scrutiny. 
  En route to Rustenburg, Mr de Klerk hopped aboard the media 
bus for an impromptu chat with the press, maize fields flashing 
past in the bus window behind him. 
  Despite laudatory efforts by his election team to lay on 
additional telephone lines to remote farms, and accommodating 
the press in each possible way, television crew members 
complained of being pumped in the ribs by police tough treatment 
specialists as they dogged Mr de Klerk's footsteps. 
  A financial newspaper reporter who coined the "balloon 
bonanza" description for the road show initially worried that 
more stones were thrown in Fochville than there were balloons, 
but his description was validated at the banquet on Friday night 
where helium-filled balloons bobbed above the diners. 
  Amid this festive decor on Friday night, Mr de Klerk warned 
Conservative Party [CP] supporters against being led over the 
edge to violence and crime. 
  The CP had had numerous chances to prove its support, he 
said, but lost the 1983 referendum, the 1987 election, the 1989 
election and the 1992 referendum. 
  On Saturday he will be in Vryburg -- one of the few 
certainties in South African politics.

  [Text] State President Mr. F.W. de Klerk says he hopes to 
make an announcement early next week on a multiparty plan to end 
the violence on the East Rand. Speaking at Rustenburg during 
his election campaign visit to the Western Transvaal, President 
de Klerk said the East Rand was faced, not only with a security 
problem, but with a socioeconomic issue. The solution had to 
make provision for a socioeconomic upliftment program. He said 
consultations were still being held with the ANC [African 
National Congress] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the 
multiparty plan. 
  President de Klerk said he was not worried about Mr. Nelson 
Mandela's personal attacks on him because they were not based on 
fact, but that it did concern him that somebody of Mr. Mandela's 
status acted so irresponsibly. He said Mr. Mandela was making 
personal attacks on him instead of condemning the activities of 
the Self-Defense Units on the East Rand. 
  President de Klerk said the election was not centered on 
freedom, because South Africans were already free, but that it 
suited the opposition to talk about freedom as they did not have 
a real message for the future. 
  He said right-wingers had no justification for threats of 
war. The CP [Conservative Party] had lost two referendums and 
two elections and would have to accept the majority decision.

  [Text] Vryburg Jan 22 SAPA--Things could go terribly wrong 
if too much power was put into the hands of political parties 
with hidden agendas and a lack of government experience, 
President FW de Klerk warned on Saturday. He was speaking on 
the final day of his Western Transvaal election trail, during 
which he addressed a meeting at a Rustenburg Golf Club and a 
rally at the Vryburg showgrounds. 
  Mr de Klerk called for support for the National Party [NP] 
so 
it could protect the vested interests of all South Africans, 
including those of blacks. He did not believe opinion polls 
which showed relatively poor support for the NP because the 
surveys had been conducted in areas where intimidation ran rife. 
  The majority of coloureds, Indians, and whites, and a 
significant proportion of blacks, supported the NP, he said. 
"We can win. Winning means getting the biggest percentage of 
the vote, not 50 per cent or more." 
  Mr de Klerk added, "I have no doubt that the whole world 
wants the NP to do well because the investors of the world trust 
our financial policies, they distrust the financial policies of 
the African National Congress." 
  The future government's financial policy should be balanced 
to accommodate the interests of both those who had much to lose 
and those who needed to gain because they suffered. "Those who 
have much to lose does not mean white South Africans," Mr de 
Klerk said. All people with own businesses, houses, jobs and 
pension funds had much to lose unless there was a system which 
protected these vested interests, he said.

  [Text] A comprehensive plan to tackle South Africa's 
spiraling political violence should be completed within days. 
This, according to ANC [African National Congress] leader 
Nelson Mandela. The plan, put together by South Africa's main 
political players, would not immediately ease the plight of 
people living in violence-ridden townships. 
  [Begin Mandela recording] We should not have exaggerated 
expectations. We are putting that plan this week, but it's 
going to take some time before all the interested parties are 
able to put an end to the violence, and to ensure that people 
resume normal life. [end recording]

  [Text] Both the ANC [African National Congress] and the 
Democratic Party [DP] have criticized a reported 20 percent 
salary increase for most senior public servants. The DP said in 
a statement that the increases were outrageous and asked the 
commission for administration to rescind the decision 
immediately. The DP spokesman on the public service, Mr. Roger 
Burrows, criticized what he called the secretive manner in which 
the increases had been handled. Earlier at a conference on the 
reconstruction of the country the ANC decided to ask that the 
increases be frozen, and that the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] investigate the matter. 
  The minister in charge of the public service, Mr. Sam de 
Beer, says that only 1.5 percent of the 850 million rands made 
available in May last year for salary increases was set aside 
for senior officials. He said about 35 percent of the money had 
been earmarked for lower qualified public servants. Mr. de Beer 
said he would comment further on the issue at a news conference 
on Thursday [27 Thrusday].

Hennie Bekker on Monday criticised the government which Sunday 
[23 January] news reports said had planned wage increases of up 
to 20 per cent for top officials. "Such action is clearly 
directed to improve the already lucrative pension positions of 
senior civil servants at the cost of the taxpayer who has become 
the milking cow of government," he said. The average wage 
increase for most civil servants is 5.7 percent.

  We have thus characterised the year 1994 to express the 
deep-seated hope of all our people that, this year, all of us 
will, at last, achieve our emancipation. This year a new birth 
will occur. 
  The physical being that will be its offspring will be like 
the new beginning which occurs when the spring rains wash away 
the dead leaves of winter and give life to the summer green 
which, as an expression of the rhythm of the seasons, blankets 
our earth. That new birth will signal the wonder that we have 
begun to construct a new social order. 
  It will say to us and to the world that we, the people of 
South Africa have, at last, entered our new age, during which we 
shall be called upon to respond to the call of history which 
summons us to achieve our own freedom from tyranny, from 
injustice, from hunger, from deprivation and from the indignity 
and insult of racism and apartheid. 
  As an expression of its glorious humanism, the new age will, 
at the same time as it liberates the oppressed, endow the 
oppressor with the gift of emancipation from ignorance, from 
fear, and freedom from hatred and bigotry. It will also bless 
our country with the reward of its emancipation from isolation 
by the community of nations. 
  We sit at the southern-most tip of Africa as in the eye of a 
storm. That storm sweeps across the human habitat. Like the 
spring rains, it seeks to drive away the pestilences that 
continue to afflict the world of living beings, the universal 
malignancies which seem to have found a home in our diseased 
society. 
  Today, our country and ourselves have come face-to-face with 
an historic opportunity to transform ourselves. By virtue of the 
fact that they will record success, our victories will say to 
the peoples of the world that the triumph of all humanity over 
the same problems that find concentrated expression in our 
country is assured. 
  As we rise to the challenge of change, the eyes of the 
peoples of the world are upon us. These masses are rooting for 
us. These millions are willing us to succeed. This moment of 
opportunity is itself a product of a struggle waged both by 
ourselves and by the peoples of the world. And yet, in the 
language of the game of chess, it does not represent our end 
game. 
  Our election victory in April will enable us to take a great 
leap forward. But this will be a dangerous leap unless we have 
the vision, the programmatic framework, the strength and the 
will to bring about fundamental change. 
  To achieve this requires that we read every sign with great 
attention, to plan for every eventuality, to learn the hard 
lessons of history, to know our country and to understand the 
social forces that make it what it is. 
  Fundamental change will not occur simply because elections 
will have taken place on April 27th. It will come about because 
of our engagement of our actuality, inspired by an unrelenting 
determination to make an actual and visible change. The greater 
the victory of the democratic forces in those elections, the 
better will be our capacity to transform South Africa. 
  But this we must also understand, that the more decisive 
that 
victory, the more violent the resistance to change might be on 
the part of those forces that do not want change. 
  The first challenge we shall face from these forces which 
represent the past which our people seek to repudiate, will be a 
determined effort to ensure that our country is unable to hold 
free and fair elections. The greatest and most obvious threats 
facing us in this regard is violence. We must confront this 
problem on all fronts, including those instances where we, 
ourselves, might be more the perpetrators rather than the 
victims of this violence. 
  As a movement, we are also faced with an insidious threat. 
This is the threat of complacency. Encouraged by the good 
results indicated in many opinion polls and by our direct 
experience as a result of direct contact with the people, we 
might allow the situation to arise where by our activists and 
supporters might get convinced that the victory we seek is 
already won. 
  We have to fix this firmly in our minds that every vote 
counts. We must ensure that this becomes our actual programme 
that we reach out to every voter and work to ensure that every 
voter actually votes and votes correctly. 
  Beyond the elections, we must also realise that we shall 
continue to confront threats from those who are implacably 
opposed to democracy. We have only to look at what is happening 
around us in the region of southern Africa to understand the 
possibility of the kind of havoc which can make it very 
difficult to build upon the victories of our struggle. 
  This matter is pertinent to the outcome of the elections, 
the 
challenge to defend the democratic victory and our capacity to 
bring about fundamental change in our country. In our approach 
to these and other issues, we must proceed from the fundamental 
consideration that our responsibility to our people and to the 
peoples of the world leaves no margin of error in the manner in 
which we prepare for the democratic transition and implement our 
vision of transformation, reconstruction and development. 
  The vision reflected in many of our documents and statements 
must be translated into a policy framework. Over the past year, 
many comrades in our movement have been grappling with this 
task. Hence this conference will have placed before it the sixth 
draft of our strategy, reconstruction and development document. 
  We will therefore receive and consider a document which lays 
the basis for far-reaching change and the achievement of genuine 
democracy for the people of our country. For those of us who 
are already familiar with the programme, the objectives it sets 
might appear relatively easy. 
  The reality however is that as much as our political 
liberation was not easy to achieve, so will not be an easy walk 
to arrive at the point of the socio-economic upliftment of all 
the people of our country. 
  We must therefore approach the challenge of reconstruction 
and development soberly and with both feet firmly planted on the 
ground. That approach requires that we also recognise the fact 
that the sixth draft in front of us still requires a substantial 
amount of additional work to be anywhere near what we want it to 
be. 
  It however goes without saying that the principles on which 
it is based and which it elaborates are very sound and 
constitute the framework within which our democratic forces 
should approach their work once they become part of the 
democratic government. One of the principal challenges that will 
face us in that capacity -- a challenge we have to meet to make 
our reconstruction programme implement able -- is the task of 
redefining governance. 
  Having studied and criticised the old world, we must seek 
out 
a new mode of interaction between the people and their elected 
representatives, and between the governmental structures and the 
popular organisations of the people. To strengthen the bond 
between the electors and the elected, we have, for instance, 
made certain that the members of our movement had the chance to 
participate in the process of selecting those whom they wish to 
see as members of the legislative assemblies. 
  Without seeking to boast, we can say that we stand head and 
shoulders above our contenders in the election in the democracy 
and transparency of our selection process. We are in the process 
of producing a governing team whose skills, talents and 
dedication to the public good assures that we are putting 
together a winning combination which will inspire the confidence 
and kindle the hopes of all our people, both black and white. 
  This team will enter governance not for power and glory, but 
as an act of responsibility to all our people. It will therefore 
be ready to deal with the hard questions of our reality, without 
seeking to delude the people with empty promises, fully 
understanding that the people have a right to know the truth 
about what is possible. 
  Our country has arrived at this exciting conjuncture because 
we took good care to build a strong organisation of the people 
-- the African National Congress. In the face of what lies ahead 
of us, the need for that strong organisation, rooted among the 
masses, is even greater. We must, therefore, make certain that 
whatever else we do, we must have the strength to continue to 
build such an organisation. 
  This is true of all the other organisations of the 
democratic 
movement, including the youth and women's movements, the trade 
unions, the civics and other representatives of civil society. 
  What I have been trying to say to this historic conference 
is 
that in the period ahead we will encounter many hardships. To 
overcome them we will need more than good intentions. 
  We will need strong organisation, effective and accountable 
government, a realistic plan whose implementation will actually 
change the lives of our people, and a determined effort to 
thwart the schemes of those who want to block the emergence of 
the new society. Above all, we need the commitment and 
involvement of everybody present here today in the common effort 
to create a new society and a new nation. 
  Before I close I would like to address a special word to 
those of our compatriots who belong to the organisations that 
belong to the Freedom Alliance. We urge them to approach the 
current negotiations in a serious spirit of give and take and 
with a determination to find solutions acceptable to all the 
people of our country and not merely the constituencies they 
represent. 
  We take the demands they have presented very seriously. We 
are determined to address them to the best of our ability. We 
therefore take the negotiations very seriously and approach them 
with an open mind to find mutually acceptable solutions. 
  We appeal to all of them that they take the same attitude, 
understanding that we are not their enemies. What we are is 
enemies of racism and oppression. We trust that they too are 
enemies of racism and oppression and are therefore open to reach 
the necessary compromises which will deliver our country from 
the racism, oppression and conflict from which it must 
emancipate itself. 
  In the great effort to create a new society and a new nation 
we dare not fail. History and the world will judge us very 
harshly if we do not do what is just and correct. We will not 
have a second chance. 
  I wish the conference success, confident that you will 
approach your work with all due seriousness and realism. 
  Thank you.

said the list could still be subject to alterations, as the 
individuals concerned could decide to pursue other interests or 
party assignments.

<F P=106> [Report by Enoch Sithole] </F>
  [Text] The list of people nominated to be ANC [African 
National Congress] members of parliament in the National 
Assembly has raised concerns over the exclusion of certain 
people who had originally been nominated by the branches or 
regions of the organisation. Most serious, however, is the 
inclusion of certain people who had not been nominated by the 
regions or branches. 
  One of the most noticeable exclusions is that of former 
KaNgwane chief minister, Enos Mabuza, who was number 62 on the 
list, but who was convinced to stay out because of his 
membership of the SA Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board. 
Other names that have been struck off the list are those of 
Sheila Sisulu, Franklin Sonn, Professor Njabulo Ndebele and 
Billy Modise, also because of their membership of the SABC board. 
  Most controversial is the including of people like Gazankulu 
chief minister, Samuel Nxumalo, who never featured in the list 
submitted by the Northern Transvaal region of the ANC. Nxumalo 
is but one of the names that was included in the list by the 
National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC so as to comply 
with the undertaking to include representatives of organisations 
that are members of the Patriotic Front. 
  People like Lebowa chief minister Nelson Ramodike featured 
in 
the list of the Northern Transvaal region as they made an 
undertaking at an early stage that they were prepared to fight 
the election under the ANC umbrella. Nxumalo's Ximoko 
Progressive Party (XPP), on the other hand, announced only last 
week that it was going to fight the election together with the 
ANC. 
  Sources from the Northern Transvaal region of the ANC said 
they expected their grassroots membership to strongly object to 
Nxumalo's name being on the ANC list. 
  A meeting has been arranged for this week between XPP and 
the 
ANC where the former will apparently extract a commitment to ANC 
policies by the latter. An irate delegate from that region said 
he was happy that ANC leader Nelson Mandela was going to tour 
the area shortly to hold People's Forums. "He will answer for 
the NEC why people like this were included," he said. 
  Nxumalo told SUNDAY NATION that he was happy to be on the 
ANC 
list. Nxumalo, who a few months ago shared a platform with 
state president F.W. de Klerk at a National Party [NP] rally in 
Pietersburg, admitted that some members of his party were more 
lenient towards the NP and said he would "try" to persuade them 
to understand "the concept of liberation". 
  Eastern Transvaal and the Western Cape are also fuming over 
Mabuza's and Sonn's exclusion, respectively. One Western Cape 
region delegate at the ANC's conference being held at Nasrec [a 
conference center] in Johannesburg said: "They (the NEC) should 
at least have referred the names back to us for our consent." 
  Meanwhile, other prominent ANC leaders do not feature in the 
National Assembly list as they will stand for the Senate and the 
provincial legislatures. Assistant general secretary Jacob Zuma 
is not on the list as he is the organisation's choice for the 
premiership of the Natal province. Other popular figures like 
Matthew Phosa, Terror Lekota, Allan Boesak and Tokyo Sexwale are 
not on the list as they have been chosen to stand as premiers of 
their respective regions. Stalwarts like Govan Mbeki and Harry 
Gwala are also not on the list after having asked to be left to 
stand in their regions. 
  Cheryl Carolus, head of the ANC's health department, was a 
surprise omission. She told SUNDAY NATION that while she spent 
most of her life in the struggle she never dreamed of becoming a 
politician. 
  ANC deputy-president Walter Sisulu is also not on the list. 
When asked why, he said: "You will find me in other tasks." 
His wife Albertina is number 10 on the list. 
  Some candidates on the list are most likely to forfeit their 
present positions in churches, trade unions and other civil 
society organisations. At the time of going to press, the 
general secretary of the Institute of Contextual Theology, 
Catholic priest Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, was having a 
meeting with the church council to decide his future. This 
comes after a call by People John II that Catholic priests 
should choose between politics and their religious work. 
Another cleric on the list is Sister Bernard Ncube. 
  Police, Prisons and Civil Rights' Union president Gregory 
Rockman resigned from the union after he heard he was on the ANC 
list.

<F P=106> [National Party Statement on the ANC election list issued by </F>
the NP Federal Council on 21 January 1994 on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] The ANC's [African National Congress] election list 
poses a grave danger to South Africa. The SACP [South African 
Communist Party] has succeeded in its aim to get a stranglehold 
on the ANC's list. Of the first 50 candidates 27 are member of 
the SACP (54!) with another possible seven. It is clear that the 
SACP has concentrated its efforts to be in the top of the list, 
as fewer SACP members are listed further town. In the second 
group of 50 there are 15 SACP (30!) members with a possibility 
of six more. In the third 50, eight SACP (16!) members, with 2 
more possibilities. [numbers in parentheses as received] 
  Other main features of the list are: 
  The absence of all the celebrities whom the ANC had misused 
to attract attention to their list. It is clear that many of 
these celebrities do not regard the ANC as an organisation which 
they want to be associated with. 
  The fact that some of the ANC's allies have been given a 
cold 
shoulder as illustrated by the fact that Labour Party members 
are relegated to positions low down on the list. 
  The fact that the ANC is persevering with the inclusion of 
Mrs Winnie Mandela, who has been given a senior position. It 
was unthinkable that in a democratic society that somebody who 
has been convicted of a serious common crime, especially one of 
kidnapping a child, is placed in a position where she may attain 
political power. 
  It is clear that the moderates in the ANC have been 
outmanouvred by the SACP and other militant elements will be 
placed in a position to take control of the ANC and defeat the 
ANC's moderate elements. 
  All South Africans who believe in true democracy, federal 
principles and a free market economy, must now ignore the minor 
differences that exist between them and unite to prevent the 
names on this election list ever to become the strongest party 
in Parliament.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 21 SAPA--State President F W de Klerk 
had abused his chancellorship of the Unversity of Potchefstroom 
and the university had in an improper manner made available 
first year students for his public meeting at Potchefstroom on 
Thursday night, according to the Conservative Party [CP]. In a 
statement on Friday CP MP Fanie Jacobs said the CP offices had 
received a large number of complaints from parents of first year 
students, who alleged their childrens' attendance had been 
brought about by a "form of intimidation". 
  He said the university had defended the organisation of the 
meeting as being "voluntarily", but had also acknowledged the 
state president's speech was within the framework of first year 
students' welcoming and orientation programme. First year 
students were obliged to take part in orientation programmes 
during the orientation period, Mr Jacobs said. 
  The university's irresponsible and insensitive conduct had 
raised the polarisation among parents to breaking point, he said. 
  Tax payers' money, which kept universities running, had been 
abused to the benefit of Mr de Klerk and the National Party [NP] 
which seriously violated the principle of equal treatment of 
political parties, he added. In view of the unjustified 
promotion of the NP, the CP and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front] would soon apply to the university authorities 
to be granted the same opportunity to address first year 
students. 
  Mr Jacobs also challenged Mr de Klerk to address a public 
meeting in the Potchefstroom town hall within the next few weeks 
which, he said, would indicate how little the state president's 
support was in the Western Transvaal.

  [Text] The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of South Africa 
has suspended three of its members, including two senior 
officials with immediate effect for violating party procedures 
by raising party matters with the media. 
  The announcement of the suspension of the PAC's national 
director of publicity, Mr. Waters Toboti, the regional secretary 
of central Transkei, Mr. Mfanelo Skwatsh, and a member of the 
Azanian National Youth League, Mr. (Chargin Mabaso), was made by 
the PAC's secretary general, Mr. Benny Alexander. The decision 
to suspend them was taken at the organization's national working 
committee in Johannesburg today. 
  Mr. Alexander said they were suspended for making media 
statements challenging the national working committee's position 
to place a moratorium on the armed struggle. He said certain 
sections of the media strived to project divisions within the 
PAC in the run-up to the election, but failed to communicate the 
overwhelming support for the moratorium on the armed struggle.

  [Text] Durban Jan 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday said he had little 
faith in last-ditch negotiations between the Freedom Alliance 
[FA], the African National Congress [ANC] and the government. 
Addressing hundreds of kwaZulu Police recruits at a graduation 
ceremony in Ulundi as the homeland's minister of police, Mr 
Buthelezi said "we may as well brace ourselves for the long and 
hard road ahead of us". 
  Referring to trilateral talks in Johannesburg on Wednesday 
night, which delegates said were fruitful, Mr Buthelezi said: 
"I am not at all optimistic that anything concrete is going to 
come out of these negotiations." 
  He alleged chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer 
"virtually 
told" television audiences after the talks that the interim 
constitution would not be amended, "or if at all, not 
substantially to accommodate the concerns of his majesty the 
king (Goodwill Zwelithini), and also members of the FA". 
  "I am afraid I must state that while I was pleased with the 
way these talks went, I am very pessimistic about the outcome of 
these negotiations. We have suffered a lot of blood and tears 
all these years of oppression, and it may well be that we will 
not be out of that dark dungeon of suffering even after the 
elections," Mr Buthelezi said.

  [Text] Durban Jan 20 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] would only be able to implement rulings in kwaZulu 
territory by force, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [20 January]. He said the 
kwaZulu government would not safeguard the lives of South 
African security forces deployed in the territory without 
permission from the kwaZulu Police [KZP] commissioner. 
  Speaking in Ulundi at a passing-out parade for KZP recruits, 
Mr Buthelezi repeated that kwaZulu did not recognise the TEC's 
authority. The TEC could make "as many rulings on kwaZulu as it 
likes but it will not be able to implement those rulings, except 
by force". 
  He also reiterated that any attempt to deploy South African 
security forces in kwaZulu without permission from the KZP 
commissioner would be viewed as an invasion. The IFP leader has 
previously said such an "invasion" would be resisted. 
  Mr Buthelezi said the TEC's request for deployment of South 
African forces in kwaZulu amounted to "interfering in our 
internal affairs and compromising the sovereignty of kwaZulu". 
  The TEC last year requested the SAP [South African Police] 
be 
deployed in four violence-ridden areas of northern Natal/kwaZulu 
policed by the KZP. The decision followed a Goldstone 
Commission report on the existence of a hit squad in the KZP. 
Mr Buthelezi said the kwaZulu government was "deeply hurt" by 
the report and again denied there was such a hit squad. 
  The TEC this week made a third request for KZP Commissioner 
Gen Roy During to appear before it to report on the finding that 
at least one KZP hit squad had been responsible for several 
deaths, including those of African National Congress members. 
  An employee at Gen During's Ulundi office said he was on 
leave until the end of January.

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 22 SAPA--A contributing factor in the 
attacks of journalists was the perception that they were partial 
and took sides, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi said on Saturday [22 January]. 
  In a memorandum presented to the media workers of South 
African in Ulundi, Chief Buthelezi said in fact many IFP, Pan 
Africanist Congress and Azanian People's Organisation supporters 
saw journalists as taking the side of the African National 
Congress [ANC]. "Since the unbanning of the ANC, hundreds of 
IFP leaders and supporters have been decimated by Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadres intent on 
wiping our organisation from the face of the earth. But instead 
of there being widespread coverage of this genocide, there has 
been deathly silence on the part of the press. Where coverage 
has been given to IFP killings, there has been little coverage 
of the true identity of their killers or the military precision 
in which they have been conducted," he said. 
  Chief Buthelezi said the whole issue of the violence that 
had 
cost many thousands of lives had literally been swept under the 
carpet. 
  He accused the media of having supported the ANC, the 
government and the ANC's Patriotic Front when they said the IFP 
was obstructive when its negotiator wanted the issue of violence 
to be dealt with as a priority issue at the start of the 
multiparty talks in April last year. "This issue, as I have 
stated, is largely under-reported. Members of the IFP have been 
the main victims of this violence, and yet we are deliberately 
being portrayed as its main perpetrators. Added to this failure 
to report on these killings is of course the selective reporting 
of massacres involving supporters of either side. One just has 
to think of Boipatong. While there was widespread coverage of 
this heinous deed and rightfully so, the massacres of IFP people 
involving equally large numbers in Natal and Zonkezizwe in the 
Transvaal received little or no coverage," he said. 
  Chief Buthelezi said since the IFP walked out of the 
multi-party talks they have been attacked and ridiculed by the 
press and very seldom had the reasons of the action been spelt 
out to the public. He further said with the public only being 
fed which the ANC and the government allowed, it was not 
surprising to "us that we in the Freedom Alliance [FA] have come 
to be seen as spoilers". 
  Chief Buthelezi said the extent to which the FA had backed 
down was clear from their preparedness to reduce their original 
16 points to four. 
  He also said without the government and the ANC acceding to 
the minimum demands the FA felt it was unreasonable for 
observers to expect them to fight the election. Despite the 
lack of progress in resolving these issue, the IFP along with 
the FA, were continuing to meet the government in the hope of 
achieving a breakthrough, he said.

<F P=106> [By Mohseen Jeenah, APLA member and Durban student leader, </F>
sent to WEEKLY MAIL hours before his death; first paragraph is 
newspaper introduction] 
  [Text] One of the last things Durban student leader Mohseen 
Jeenah did before he died was send a story to the MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN putting the case of those APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army] guerrillas who refused to accept the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] order to lay down their arms. The 
editors were mystified by this story from a writer they had 
never dealt with before, quoting an unnamed APLA commander, 
coming just as the PAC announced the end of their armed 
struggle. Within hours, however, Jeenah was shot down in the 
streets by police, after allegedly taking part in an attack on a 
police station. He had put his words into action. His story 
had now become the dramatic and tragic words of the APLA 
`bitterienders.' [bitter enders]. 
  An Azanian People's Liberation Army commander has vowed that 
the armed struggle will continue until the end of the five-year 
government of national unity in 1999 and that the organisation 
will step up attacks in the run-up to the April 27 elections. 
  The commander's comments come despite the fact that the Pan 
Africanist Congress is contesting the poll and has agreed to 
negotiate a mutual cessation of hostilities with the government. 
  This correspondent met the APLA man -- who identified 
himself 
only by the name Sizwe and as the army's Natal commander -- in a 
Durban township recently. Usually reliable sources had placed 
this reporter in contact with the APLA cadre, who said he had 
joined APLA in the 1970s and had received military training in 
Tanzania and Libya. 
  In the interview, Sizwe said APLA commander Sabelo Phama had 
ordered cadres to continue waging armed struggle even after 
elections. "Our commander said we would continue fighting for 
the next five years." 
  He said the ANC [African National Congress] -- which had 
agreed to a government to national unity until the next election 
scheduled for 1999 -- had "sold out the African masses" and were 
"puppets of the regime." 
  Sizwe urged Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC 
military wing] guerrillas not to allow themselves to be 
"integrated" into the South African Police and South African 
Defence Force. He warned: "If they are stupid enough to join 
the boers, we will kill them." 
  He added that APLA would strike in Natal, which has been 
under "surveillance" and where "many units" were in place, in 
the countdown to elections. 
  "We are not fighting to vote in elections. We are fighting 
to regain the land that was stolen from our forefathers," said 
Sizwe. 
  He expressed surprise that "people want to know why we are 
fighting while the PAC is negotiating. Negotiations are not 
going to deliver genuine freedom. Only APLA can." 
  Asked whether this reflected divisions between APLA and the 
PAC, Sizwe said: "Negotiations is part of the PAC's programme. 
APLA's programme is underground and we have our own command 
structures." 
  Sizwe added that while he personally was opposed to it, news 
reports of APLA cadres being trained in Zimbabwe for inclusion 
in the National Peace-Keeping Force might reflect a strategic 
decision on the part of the guerrilla army's leadership. 
Participation would lead to cadres receiving military training 
and returning to the country ensure to MK's component in the 
force did not "oppress" Africans, he said. 
  Sizwe strongly denied that APLA was responsible for last 
July's St James massacre which left 11 people dead. "APLA has a 
very high respect for God and people who are worshiping. The 
regime is trying to bluff the world that we are a bunch of 
monsters. We are a disciplined and principled army," said Sizwe. 
  Commenting on the bus blast in central Durban late last 
year, 
Sizwe said he did not order the attack. If it was found that 
the alleged Pan Africanist Student Organisation (PASO) member, 
Xolani Cuba, charged in connection with the explosion was 
responsible, he had acted independently of APLA structures. 
  Sizwe said he would have no problem with this as PASO had 
taken a "a decision to actively engage the enemy. "They (PASO 
members) are young and fearless and are prepared to die like all 
our soldiers. They have said themselves that every PASO member 
is an APLA cadre, "added Sizwe. [quotation marks as published] 
  Sizwe said he would not kill unarmed civilians and did not 
hate whites because of the colour of their skin. "There are 
some whites who sympathise with the struggle. But as our 
founding father (Robert) Sobukwe said, it is dishonest to say 
that you hate the whip but not the person who wields it," he 
said. 
  Sizwe was adamant that he would not kill unarmed civilians 
but added that he did not "understand the fuss" created when 
"some white civilians are caught in the crossfire" as "our 
people are killed in the thousands." 
  He said APLA did not attack farmers randomly. "We receive 
reports from workers in an area about which farmers are 
oppressing them. These are the farmers APLA targets." 
  Claiming "great success" in driving farmers off the land, he 
said: "in Elliot, only three farmers out of 45 are still 
occupying the land." 
  Spelling out how APLA structures operate, he said cadres 
received their instructions from the high command based outside 
the country. 
  "Each unit is made up of three to five cadres, each with a 
commander. The unit commanders report to the area commander who 
is in charge of that specific area. 
  "The area commanders then report to the regional commander 
who then reports to the high command," Sizwe said. He said the 
area commander instructed one of his units to keep a target 
under surveillance for more than a week. He then planned how 
the attack should be executed with the regional commander.

  [Text] Harare Jan 22 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples' 
Liberation Army [APLA] said on Saturday from its Harare office 
that the crucial issue of a negotiated mutual cessation of 
hostilities remains unresolved. This was in spite of the 
moratorium declared by its parent body, the Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC], last week, to which APLA and its high command 
had complied. 
  "It has been and it remains the PAC position that this issue 
is a matter that must be settled between APLA and the South 
African security forces, mainly the SA Defence Force and 
Police," said a statement. 
  "We wish to warn that failure to reach an agreement on a 
mutual cessation of hostilities could automatically mean a total 
collapse of the moratorium. 
  "However, as long as the moratorium remains in place any 
statement to the media challenging it will not be representative 
of the APLA position."

  [Text] Harare Jan 24 SAPA--Azanian People's Liberation Army 
[APLA] Commander Sabelo Phama has dissociated APLA from claims 
that it would continue fighting in spite of the suspension of 
the armed struggle by its parent Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC]. 
  Callers claiming to be APLA commanders have vowed to 
continue 
fighting in spite of PAC leaders' decision on January 16 to 
suspend the fight. "Various political decisions have been made 
and one of them is that we would stop armed operations. That is 
exactly what we have done," the Harare-based HERALD newspaper 
quoted Mr Phama as saying in a weekend interview in Windhoek, 
Namibia. 
  The APLA leader said it was most unlikely that the claims 
were made by APLA members. "Specific instructions have since 
gone out to our members to cease all military operations as per 
the decision of our political leadership, and they have (ceased 
operations). Now we have all these people 'phoning newspapers 
in South Africa with so- called pre-arranged codes and claiming 
to be members of APLA, vowing to continue the armed struggle. 
Who are they? I can say with authority that they are not our 
people." 
  Mr Phama was sure the claims were part of a campaign to 
discredit the PAC and APLA. He also dismissed charges that his 
organisation had been responsible for a spate of controversial 
attacks on civilians such as last month's shooting at the 
Heidelberg tavern in Cape Town which left four people dead. 
"There have been many attacks on innocent civilians and certain 
people claiming to be our guerrillas have occasionally claimed 
responsibility. I know which ones have been our operations and 
which have not...And I can tell you that we have not conducted 
any atrocities."

  [Text] London Jan 22 SAPA -- The governor of the Reserve 
Bank, Dr Chris Stals, said on saturday a continued outflow of 
foreign capital from South Africa would have serious 
consequences for the economy, reports SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news. He said a new government 
would have to pay urgent attention to this. 
  Dr Stals was speaking at a conference in London organised by 
the United Nations anti-apartheid committee and the London 
School for Economics. 
  He said foreign capital of R[Rand]10,000 million had left 
the 
country in the second half of last year, despite the lifting of 
sanctions. This was almost double the net outflow of capital in 
the first six months of last year.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  ANC Health Plan--"It's going to be extremely difficult for 
anyone to lightly dismiss the ANC's [African National Congress] 
new health plan. It has morality and common-sense on its side," 
begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 January in a 
page-8 editorial. However, the ANC's "good intentions are one 
thing, mechanisms for successfully implementing them quite 
another," warns THE STAR. Regarding the ANC's plan to 
discourage private sector health care, THE STAR believes that 
"from the ANC's point of view, such restrictions are necessary 
to achieve equity in health care provision, but they are already 
being described as having `overtones of socialism.'" 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Health Plan--"The ANC, like US President Bill Clinton a 
year ago, will enter government faced with a health service in 
crisis due to rising costs which are placing health care beyond 
the means of many people. The draft national health plan 
published on Wednesday for public debate is an honest attempt to 
address that crisis," starts an editorial on page 8 of the 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 January. "Some of 
its prescriptions, though, are off the mark." Financing the ANC 
plan "assumes the existing budgets should meet most requirements 
once savings have been made through the elimination of 
mismanagement and general inefficiencies which have 
characterised the apartheid era. This is wishful thinking." 
"It is naive to think that rationalisation will bring major 
cost savings." With financing of the plan a given problem, the 
"main shortcoming is the desire to `discourage' private sector 
health care." "The test for the ANC is to produce an affordable 
plan without threatening existing services and standards." 
  Mandela's Violence Accusations Viewed--"There is one glaring 
flaw in ANC president Nelson Mandela's repeated claim that 
President FW de Klerk and his government have consciously 
orchestrated township violence to undermine the ANC's support 
base," states a second editorial on the same page. "Opinion 
polls show ANC support has risen steadily in tandem with levels 
of violence, while NP [National Party] fortunes have declined." 
"It is easy, as Mandela repeatedly does on this issue, to take 
cheap shots based on less than rigorous analysis. We could just 
as easily argue that, to judge by the outcome, Mandela and the 
ANC orchestrated the violence to improve their own standing at 
the polls." In conclusion the paper writes that "no one can 
stop Mandela continuing to make this claim against De Klerk. He 
has already made it so often that it has become folklore in ANC 
circles. But it will hardly improve the unifying abilities of 
the future president of the government of national unity."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  ANC Program--"Nelson Mandela's call this week for an end to 
the rent boycotts that have crippled the administration of the 
townships" marks "the transition of the ANC [African National 
Congress] from liberation movement to government-in-waiting," 
the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English editorial on 23 
January on page 20 notes. The editorial describes the ANC's 
program of reconstructiona and development as a "desperate, 
amateurish first attempts to come to grips with the needs of 
40-million people, half of them illiterate and two-thirds 
impoverished." Referring to the ANC program's "economic babble," 
the editorial notes that "all this well-meaning babble is 
difficult to connect to the immense and very real problems 
facing the ANC. Peace, or the restoration of law and order, will 
be the work of a decade, and it will not be accomplished unless 
the ANC learns to treat its opponents with greater tolerance 
than the township self-defense units show." "As for jobs, 
education, health, housing, the ANC will not only need the help 
of existing `power structures,' but it will be hard put simply 
to avoid disastrous error." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  ANC Candidates--An editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY 
NATION in English on 23 January on page 8 notes that the ANC 
list of 200 candidates for the National Assembly is "remarkable" 
in that the ANC "lived up to its democratic tradition in the 
process of nominating people as its membership from the 
grassroots became directly involved." "Also noteworthy is the 
fact that they were able to pull together a large section of the 
South African society into its list." The editorial hopes that 
"the same process, or even a more improved one, is going to be 
followed for the local government elections." However "the list 
represents more of a popularity poll and a strategy to win more 
votes rather than a selection of people who will perform 
particular tasks once they are in Parliament." "Of more concern 
is the fact that certain people on the list are not known to be 
loyal to ANC policy" and some "are even regarded as enemies by 
people who live near them." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  East Rand Cancer Must Not Spread--The Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans of 20 January says in a page-10 editorial: "Whether 
the black residential areas of the East Rand are officially 
declared disaster areas is of purely academic interest. For all 
practical purposes they have been disaster areas for a long time 
already. They are also battlefields, where people are murdered 
daily as a result of the bloody political struggle between the 
African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. How 
leaders of these two groups can allow their supporters to create 
such a situation is inconceivable." "The infrastructure there 
has been totally destroyed, vandalism and anarchy prevail, the 
hostility and suspicion between groups is tangible, and the 
image of the security forces as maintainers of law and order has 
been totally shattered." "Now is not the time for political 
parties to be blaming one another as to who is responsible. Now 
is the time to rescue what can be rescued." BEELD concludes: 
"If political opponents can be drawn into such a plan and the 
community does its part, this ulcer on the East Rand can be 
excised. It is a cancer which must not be allowed to spread." 
  Self-Interested People Sabotage Their Own Future--A second 
editorial of the 20 January BEELD on page 10 points out: "The 
disruption of medical services as has happened at Kalafong 
Hospital outside Pretoria resembles in several aspects last 
year's catastrophic disruption of black education. In both 
cases the disruption was caused by people responsible for the 
care of those who in civilized society would be protected--in 
one case children, in the other, the sick." "In both cases the 
motive was self- interest." "Both cases represent a disruption 
of essential services to a community which can ill afford it, by 
people from the same community. In this way people are 
sabotaging their own future." 
  Mandela Must Count His Words--A third editorial says: "Mr. 
Nelson Mandela certainly had no ulterior motive when he said 
that it could be in the country's interests to have a non-ANC 
president, even if the ANC wins the April election. He was 
probably only being generous. But Mr. Mandela should realize 
that because of his position as the leader of what seems to be 
the strongest political grouping in the country, he has a 
particular duty to consider his words carefully. He cannot 
utter such a far-reaching statement and simply walk away without 
indicating who he had in mind. What his followers think of such 
a statement, only he could know. But one can guess that there 
would be shock and confusion. The electorate have an absolute 
right to know for whom and for what they are going to vote. 
Indeed, their vote is not a mandate for politicians to appoint 
people for whom they did not vote. Times are simply too serious 
for this kind of loose talk. Politicans must make it their duty 
to reduce, not increase, the confusion."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  ANC To Win Election `Handsomely'--Johannesburg THE CITIZEN 
in 
English on 18 January in its page-6 editorial says "it is clear 
from polls that the ANC [African National Congress] is going to 
win handsomely." "Considering how confident the National Party 
[NP] was of winning the election or gaining enough support to 
curb the ANC in a government of national unity, the poll comes 
as a shock to many of its followers (although previous polls 
showed a similar trend in favour of the ANC). The NP's 
confidence was misplaced from the outset. Not only did it not 
take into account the historical fact that liberation 
organisations win the elections in Africa, but it puts its faith 
in a possible alliance of moderates that would counter ANC. In 
the event the NP ended up with no allies, moderate or 
otherwise." The NP's "biggest mistake was to seek an 
accommodation with the ANC while ignoring the others." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Township Residents Urged To End Rent, Services Boycott--The 
ending of the 10-year-old township rent and service charge 
boycott, now endorsed by Nelson Mandela, "should mark the 
beginning of a process to restore effective governance to South 
Africa's dormitory towns," declares a page-12 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 January. The "root 
cause" of the township problem "is to be found in the misguided 
conviction by the architects of apartheid that township 
residents, without any industrial tax base or outside support, 
could keep those areas financially viable." "Today many 
townships are bereft of effective leadership and in a state of 
administrative collapse. They are also burdened with a 
collective R[rand]1.84 billion debt resulting from boycotts." 
Residents are urged to heed Mandela's plea to end the boycott of 
rents and service payments, and "concentrate on making the 
townships governable." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Urged To Take Stand Against Hospital 
Workers--Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 January in a 
page-6 editorial notes that the sporadic strikes at various 
hospitals "have been the result of disputes over a well-intended 
gesture by the Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] in 
granting a R[rand]500 bonus to staff at Baragwanath as a reward 
for their efforts in trying circumstances last year." The bonus 
was withdrawn when a similar payment was demanded by all and 
sundry at other hospitals -- "a concession both unreasonable and 
beyond the means of the TPA to pay." Hospital workers are 
"threatening the future of hospital services. It won't be long 
now before an ANC government is faced with this kind of union 
trouble in the public service. How, we wonder, would it go about 
implementing its new health policy if faced with the collapse of 
services over a bonus to which staff were not entitled?" The 
ANC is urged to take a "public stand against irresponsible 
actions by public service trade union in essential services." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Editorial Views ANC Election List--"The chief characteristic 
of the ANC's list of candidates for the 27 April election is 
that it is not representative of a single party. It 
encompasses, rather, a broad alliance of known leaders from the 
ANC itself, a whole group of communists, socialist trade union 
leaders, homeland leaders, members of parliament from the 
tricameral parliament, and even a few members from the 
entertainment industry," begins a page-22 editorial in 
Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 23 January. "With this 
list the ANC is a step ahead of its opponents, among whom there 
is no talk of election alliances, with others still debating 
whether or not to participate in the election. In addition to 
this, the ANC has already released important elements of its 
policy documents, including health and economic policies. Both, 
as expected, contain strong socialist elements." "What stands 
out like a pole above water is that the ANC is dominated by a 
spirit of ideological dogmatism in its quest to reintroduce 
policies totally discredited in other parts of the world." "The 
ANC does not give the impression that it is an opposition party 
striving for power, but rather that it is a `liberation 
organization' waiting impatiently to take over power." "This 
psychosis must be stopped by opponents of the ANC. It should not 
be allowed to pose arrogantly as the overwhelming favorite of 
`the people' with the rest being seen as powerless, confused, 
and disparate small enclaves of opposition." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Announcement on Afrikaner Election 
`Misleading'--Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 1 January says in a page-8 editorial: 
"The announcement in the Conservative Party mouthpiece, 
PATRIOT, that an own election for `Boer Afrikaners' will be held 
on or before 27 April would be funny were it not so tragically 
misleading. In addition to the homeland dream by which voters 
are being taken for a ride, right-wing leaders recently also 
announced that an own cabinet and an own government would be put 
in place as soon as the Transitional Executive Council began 
functioning. Nothing, of course, came of that, as with so many 
other right-wing escapist promises. One can, therefore, also 
predict that nothing will come of this latest, absurd election 
promise. Should 1 million people countrywide vote for a 
homeland, and 20 million others vote for a new dispensation 
under the new constitution, what will the former have proven? 
Only that they are a minority who have no right to grab power 
and territory. The tension within the Afrikaner National Front 
hopefully indicates that there is a significant number of 
right-wing Afrikaners who want to play a constructive role by 
negotiating for their people, rather than threatening war all 
day long."

  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 23 (AFP)--Heavy arms fire rocked 
the troubled southern suburbs of the Congolese capital Sunday 
[23 January], military sources said, as an army blockade of the 
area entered its second week. 
  No reason was given for the renewed fire, after a three day 
lull, and apparent calm in the Bacongo and Makele-Kele districts. 
  The two areas are controlled by groups opposed to the 
President Pascal Lissouba and have been at the centre of fierce 
political and ethnic violence that has turned Brazzaville into a 
powder keg. 
  Around 115 people have been killed in clashes between 
supporters of Lissouba and opposition leader Bernard Kolelas. 
  The blockade of the Bacongo suburb, launched by the army on 
January 17 after renewed violence and the kidnapping of an 
officer from the president's bodyguard, continued over the 
weekend in spite of fresh doubts over its chances of success. 
  One officer close to Lissouba said the army blockade was 
"ludicrous" since the suburb could be supplied from Zaire by 
ship across the river border between the two countries. 
  Interior Minister Martin Mberi called on official radio for 
the illegal army militias to allow free movement for diplomats, 
some of whom have been harassed by militias. 
  The recent lull in fighting was preceded by a rocket attack 
Thursday which damaged a police station in the northern Ouenze 
area of Brazzaville. 
  A second rocket attack blew out the windows of a bank in the 
same district, witnesses said. No casualties were reported from 
the attacks and it was unclear who was responsible.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Government in Cotonou on 19 </F>
January; read by Government Spokesman Marius Francisco -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] At the extraordinary summit of the heads of state 
and governments of 14 countries of the franc zone, held in Dakar 
on 11 January, it was unanimously decided to devalue the CFA 
franc by 50 percent against the French franc. In a radio 
communique issued after its sitting of 12 January, the cabinet 
announced this important decision to the people of Benin and 
expressed its fear of abusive price increases, which will 
seriously erode the purchasing power of our hardworking people. 
On his return from Dakar on 12 January, the head of state 
explained in detail the reasons for the decision taken by the 
heads of state and government and invited all economic actors to 
be circumspect and show solidarity in order to spare our people 
the negative effects of the devaluation. 
  It should be recalled that since the 1980s, African 
countries 
in general and the franc zone in particular, have been facing an 
unprecedented economic crisis due to the collapse of commodity 
prices. Instead of carrying out economic adjustment programs, 
they unfortunately preferred to become indebted. Wages became 
disproportionate and budget deficits became staggering. At a 
time when trade barriers are disappearing, especially in Europe, 
an overvalued currency is a serious handicap to development. 
Aid donors, France in particular, understood this so well that 
they decided to be firm with franc zone countries, in order to 
encourage devaluation as the last possible solution. The 
message was perfectly clear. The heads of state meeting at 
Dakar understood it as well -- the African peoples also 
understood it. Unfortunately, it is regrettable to observe 
that some traders, businessmen, and industrialists -- eager for 
easy and immediate gain -- have tried to take advantage of this 
situation to bring our hardworking people to their knees. 
Anarchical price hikes and the closure of some shops can be 
observed in all our major towns, in spite of the government's 
preparedness to hold discussions with the business community. 
Nothing justifies the 50, 100, and even 150 percent price 
increases over the prices prevailing before the devaluation, 
except the desire to get rich quick by riding on the backs of 
our people, who have already been hard hit by the world economic 
crisis. This is a bitter observation, because the advent of 
democratic renewal has ushered in an era of trust between the 
government and the business community. The anti-nationalistic 
adjustments made by some members of the business community today 
strengthens the conviction that democracy can only be maintained 
and developed by the organization of a relentless fight against 
a nostalgia for dictatorial power and the enslavement of the 
people. This is why the cabinet, concerned about the legitimate 
interests of the people and desirous to maintain the social 
balance needed for the pursuit of its structural adjustment 
program, has taken today the following conservation measures: 
1) The banning of price increases in Benin by decree dated this 
day; 2) the freezing at 11 January levels, throughout the 
country and until further notice, of the prices of the following 
essential commodities: rice, sugar, cement, tinned tomatoes, 
milk, bread, school supplies, pharmaceutical products, khaki, 
locally-made toilet and household soaps, locally-brewed beer, 
and edible oil. It must be stated that state offices and 
companies like the Benin Water and Electricity Corporation, the 
National Petroleum Products Marketing Company, the Joint 
Benin-Niger Railway and Transport Organization, the Cotonou 
Autonomous Port, the Posts and Telecommunications Office, and 
the SONAR [expansion unknown] are of course complying with the 
prevailing measures on prices and stocks; 3) the systematic 
control of prices and stocks of the products concerned in 
commercial houses and marketplaces by joint teams composed of 
workers from different public administrations. 
  To mitigate short-term inflationary effects and reduce 
unemployment, the government has decided on the following 
compensatory measures: 1) Tariff reform, which will be 
implemented in conjunction with members of the business 
community; 2) essential commodities will be supplied in the 
country, to the tune of 2 billion CFA francs; 3) the budgetary 
credit initially set up under the primary school rehabilitation 
scheme will be doubled; 4) procurement of textbooks for schools 
and colleges will be carried out; 5) half the amount of the 
duties and taxes paid on goods which arrived at the port before 
the devaluation will be reimbursed upon presentation of the 
relevant documents; 6) the setting up of a social fund of 
between 1.5 and 2 billion CFA francs, with French financing for 
labor-intensive urban works, a school dropout resettlement 
program, an urban sanitation program at Porto-Novo and Cotonou; 
7) a salary increase has been decided upon in principle and the 
terms of its implementation will be discussed by the ministers 
of the civil service, labor, and finance with the workers; and 
8) the agricultural sector will be boosted to benefit its prime 
actors -- the peasant farmers. The minister of rural 
development is authorized to pursue the execution of the 
emergency plan that he submitted to the cabinet and to implement 
that plan over the short and medium term. 
  To enable the inhabitants of our towns and villages to be 
well informed on the ins and outs of the 50 percent CFA franc 
devaluation, the cabinet has requested: 1) The ministers of 
trade and tourism, health, finance, interior, security and 
territorial administration, and rural development together to 
organize working sessions in those districts with prefects, 
subprefects, and mayors; 2) that all its members inform their 
respective personnel concerning the objectives of the 
devaluation and the various measures arising from it; 3) that 
the minister of culture and communication instruct the General 
Directorate of the Radio and Television Corporation with a view 
to the correct presentation by local language announcers of the 
contents of this communique on radio and television, stating 
clearly that the CFA currency symbols have not changed. 
  Finally, the cabinet instructed the ministers of trade and 
tourism, the interior, security and territorial administration 
to see to the active participation of the district trade 
structures in the effective implementation of measures barring a 
rise in prices.

  [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye 
returned to Lusaka today after meeting (Katherine Bertini), 
World Food Program executive director. Also yesterday, he 
received traditional chief Muatxianvua, king of the Lunda 
people, currently on a visit to this country. Their meeting 
lasted more than 45 minutes and it allowed the two men to 
discuss issues relating to peace in this country. Both men said 
that the Lusaka peace talks must be held in the spirit of the 
Bicesse Accord and give the Angolan people the tranquillity they 
hope for. This is what traditional Chief Muatxianvua had to say: 
  [Begin Muatxianvua recording in French, with 
passage-by-passage translation into Portuguese] According to UN 
Special Representative Beye, the talks are going well. We are 
hopeful because we have given the chance to a son of Africa to 
ensure that the Lusaka talks come to a successful close. [end

  In turn, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye said the 
following: 
  [Begin Beye recording in French, with passage-by-passage 
translation into Portuguese] My constant message to the Angolan 
people is that they must believe in peace. It is up to forces 
in civilian society, religious figures, traditional chiefs, and 
respected people to make the Angolan people believe there can be 
peace. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 24 SAPA -- Maseru was quiet on Sunday 
night following a day of fighting between two military factions, 
Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesman Awie Marais said on Monday 
morning after earlier speaking to South Africa's ambassador 
there. But he said heavy overnight rains which fell over the 
Lesotho capital appeared to have caused the lull, adding it was 
believed the two factions were still in their positions. 
  Mr Marais confirmed a report that South Africa had been 
asked 
to send troops to the mountain kingdom more than a week ago, 
saying his minister, Mr Pik Botha, had since been in direct 
contact with United Nations Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyauko. 
He said no decision had yet been taken as whether to send 
troops. 
  Mr Marais said Mr Botha still maintained his advice to South 
Africans not to travel to Maseru.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the African National Congress in </F>
Johannesburg on 23 January] 
  [Text] Media Statement of the National Executive Committee 
of the African National Congress [ANC] at the conclusion of the 
National Reconstruction and Strategy Conference, 23 January 1994. 
  The African National Congress concluded its National 
Reconstruction and Strategy Conference today, 23rd January 1994, 
at Nasrec [conference center], Johannesburg. 
  The conference was called following a decision of the 
National Executive Committee [NEC] in October 1992. The 
conference involved delegations from ANC branches and regions, 
representatives of the trade unions and other sectoral 
organisations, the South African Communist Party, and parties 
and organisations from the Patriotic Front. 
  Our national conference was the culmination of a process 
that 
grew up from the branch and regional level, entailing in-depth 
discussion and elaboration of a reconstruction and development 
programme, whose object is the creation of a coherent, 
integrated policy framework to mobilise the people and the 
resources of our country for the eradication of racial 
oppression. 
  The ANC's reconstruction and development programme is 
directed at uprooting the institutionalised injustices rooted in 
our country's history of colonial conquest, racism and apartheid 
which have resulted in massive poverty cheek by jowl with wealth 
and power. The South African economy has been built by the 
efforts of all in this country. Over decades it has been 
systematically structured to serve the dominant white racial 
minority, which has employed its exclusive control over 
political power to enforce racial division in every facet of our 
national life. 
  South African society is consequently deeply scarred by 
racially determined inequalities. A handful of white owned 
conglomerates dominate South African industry, finance and 
commerce. Legally entrenched cheap labour policies, a racist 
system of education and training, and studied neglect of 
adequate fiscal provision for black education have resulted in a 
virtual white monopoly of skills and the professions. Our 
country's workforce produces far below its potential capacity 
and is ill-equipped to cope with the rapid shifts in the 
international economy. Small business remains severely stunted 
and under-developed. Large corporations refuse to invest 
adequately in research and development. South Africa has been 
consigned to the status of a net producer and exporter of raw 
materials, its manufacturing sector remains uncompetitive. 
  The undemocratic state structure that underpinned this is 
both illegitimate and unrepresentative of the diverse racial, 
cultural, class and gender composition of the South African 
people. The state is consequently unsuited to the absolutely 
necessary the purposes of reconstruction and social 
transformation. 
  South Africa's approaching democratic elections, which are 
the outcome of more than a century of struggles waged by masses 
of our people, through their national liberation movement, the 
trade unions, women's movements, civic organisations, student 
bodies, the churches and other formations, hold out the promise 
of building a better life for all the people of our country. 
The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme builds on 
this shared heritage of struggle and democratic yearnings for a 
just society. 
  For this potential of our country to be realised the people 
of South Africa must harness the resources of our country in a 
comprehensive strategy to raise our country and its people out 
of the present crisis. 
  The National Reconstruction and Strategy Conference centred 
on a study of the sixth draft of the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme (RDP) in ten commissions stretching over 
two days. Conference also produced a number of resolutions, 
arising from commission discussions, which will form the basis 
of a policy thrust and legislative programme for our country's 
first democratic government. 
  Conference agreed that the indispensable condition for the 
implementation and realisation of the RDP is a decisive victory 
for the ANC electoral front on 27th April. The attainment of 
political office by an ANC-led government of national unity, 
will be the first step towards the incremental and steady 
empowerment of all those who have been historically deprived and 
disadvantaged on the basis of race, gender or class in our 
society. 
  The RDP posits an integrated, coordinated plan that combines 
reconstruction and development with a thorough democratisation 
of South African society to unleash the energies and creativity 
of our people. Fighting poverty and deprivation, with the 
active involvement of those most afflicted by it, will be the 
priority of the democratic government. The task of building one 
South African nation, made up of people united in their 
diversity, will remain elusive unless the inequalities and 
disparities created by apartheid are swiftly overcome. 
  Conference affirmed that all participants will return to 
their branches, regions, organisatons and sectors, with the firm 
resolve to spare no efforts in working for a convincing ANC 
victory in the forthcoming elections so as to ensure the speedy 
implementation of this Reconstruction and Development Programme.

  [Text] Hopes that a last-minute constitutional agreement 
between the government, the African National Congress [ANC], and 
the Freedom Alliance can be reached have been dashed yet again. 
After 7 hours of talks in Pretoria that went into the early 
hours of this morning, the three sides failed to reach consensus 
on an inclusive constitutional deal, but they agreed to meet 
again later on today. Both government negotiator Roelf Meyer 
and ANC negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa said after the talks that 
they did not see much of a chance for agreement dealing with the 
Freedom Alliance's point of view. Conservative Party negotiator 
Dr. Corne Mulder indicated afterwards that the only deal which 
would be acceptable to the Freedom Alliance was a package which 
dealt with the alliance's demands.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks continue in Lusaka, Zambia. 
No agreement has been reached on specific principles on forming 
the national police at today's meeting. Pedro Maneul reports. 
  Good evening. The government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have not yet reached 
agreement on specific principles. The main document from the 
mediators and observers was readjusted during separate meetings 
held this morning. These readjustments, called coordination of 
language, should have been finished late this afternoon [words 
indistinct] mediators submitted documents to be examined by the 
negotiating teams. 
  We say the readjustments should have been finished late this 
afternoon, because this information has not yet been confirmed 
due to the press blackout [preceding word in English]. The 
readjustments would have transformed the document by the 
mediators into a final text, since this would come after the the 
negotiating teams replied to the document that UN's Alioune 
Blondin Beye presented to them last Thursday [20 January]. On 
that occasion, the document was already known as a proposal from 
the mediators and observers for the final discussion of specific 
principles. But since a proposal is just a proposal, replies can 
either be positive or negative. 
  Thus, some readjustments have been suggested. Now, some 
sources say that the [words indistinct] intermediary stand of 
the mediators and observers on specific principles. The sources 
say that with this stand the negotiators should propose signing 
an agreement on the principles under discussion. Sources say 
this agreement could be reached tomorrow, if UNITA does not 
complicate issues further. The government has always said yes 
to proposals by the mediators and observers.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks will continue today with 
separate meetings, the aim of which is to wind up discussions on 
the specific principles that will guide the future national 
police force. Radio Angola correspondent Pedro Manuel reports 
from Lusaka: 
  [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning. The documentation is 
nearly ready for a definitive discussion of the specific 
principles. Today will see the continuation of separate 
meetings to discuss the document that mediators and observers 
presented on 20 January and that suffered some adjustments 
yesterday afternoon. 
  It would appear that there will be lots of work to be done 
today. Analysts say that UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye does not want to put off the resolution of the 
National Police issue to tomorrow. Moreover, those analysts 
report that the atmosphere at the talks is reasonable and that 
the UN special representative would like to take advantage of 
those conditions to speed up the proceedings. It is said that 
the National Police issue should be closed quite soon and the 
document drawn up by the mediation and the peace process 
observers seems to indicate precisely that. [end recording]

  [Text] Soldiers wearing red berets deployed some 200 meters 
along the road leading to former Prime Minister Alassane 
Ouattara's residence in Cocody District, Abidjan, could not hide 
their indignation at President Bedie's provocative acts towards 
the former prime minister, particularly, his admirers, who had 
gone in large numbers from the airport to Cocody. "Mr. 
Reporter, we disapprove of President Bedie's behavior, which 
violates freedom of movement. You may write what you wish. We 
are forced to obey orders but things cannot continue this way. 
Ouattara is free to receive anybody he wants. Anyway, we 
support him this time." 
  This statement was made to us in Cocody on 22 January by a 
group of soldiers who were about to spray tear gas on Ouattara's 
close relatives and unwavering supporters near his residence. 
These soldiers, who were forced to carry out their dirty job on 
22 January, looked glum. 
  Bedie's action has only increased Ouattara's popularity. It 
has especially given us an insight into the dangers of division 
within the Army, because judging from our observations that day, 
the soldiers are not all on Bedie's side. One should therefore 
beware of committing any political blunders that could be 
detrimental to us all.

  [Text] In Djibouti the United Opposition Front is hardening 
its stand. The group has convened in Addis Ababa for the past 
three days and has decided to intensify the armed struggle to, I 
quote, overthrow the dictatorship. This latest move represents 
a shift in strategy since these opponents had advocated a 
dialogue with the authorities during their last meetings. 
Ghislaine Dupont asked Mohamed Ahmed Issa, president of the 
Opposition Front, the reasons for this shift. 
  [Begin Issa recording] All of the proposals we made to 
Hassan 
Gouled's government led to nothing. We, and our FRUD [Front for 
the Restoration of Unity and Decocracy] allies, have come here 
to discuss the new strategy to be adopted. Since Hassan 
Gouled's will not understand and rejects all proposals and 
solutions for a dialogue, we have decided to spread the struggle 
throughout the entire national territory. We have decided to 
adopt this solution. Therefore, the intensification of the armed 
struggle will be carried out by the [word indistinct] wing, that 
is by (?FRUD) and the (?FFD). As far as we are concerned, we 
are the political wing; we will join the other opposition to 
carry out our political action within the country, so we did not 
come here to take refuge in (?Addis Ababa).

<F P=106> [Interview with Nelson Mandela, president of the African </F>
National Congress, ANC, by presenter Jon Snow on 24 January; 
Mandela is in Johannesburg, Snow is in the London studio; from 
the "Channel Four" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] What message do you have for those voters who 
are not your natural constituents? 
  [Mandela] It is perfectly reasonable that some people should 
have reservations, but it is the task of our organization to put 
our policy to them, explain it as fully as possible, and leave 
it to them to decide. I am convinced that we have the best 
policy in the country and that there is no other political 
organization which has got a policy as progressive as we have, a 
policy that takes into account the aspirations of all our 
peoples and which is in a better position to address their basic 
needs. 
  [Snow] Now, over the weekend President De Klerk has called 
the ANC a party of violence that has lost control of its 
supporters. This is pretty heavy stuff so early in the campaign. 
Is there any truth in it? 
  [Mandela] Well, Mr. De Klerk is the last person to make that 
accusation, because the task of maintaining law and order and 
making sure that there is no violence is that of the government 
of the country. 
  [Snow] The relationship between you has been very critical 
in 
order to get us to this point. Now that the campaign is 
underway it sounds as if that relationship is already under very 
great stress? 
  [Mandela] No, that is a misleading impression because we 
have 
never ceased to exchange views on matters of common interest. 
This last week we have met twice and have had very fruitful 
discussions. But in the course of the campaign it is likely that 
we will say very cruel things about each other, but that does 
not affect our ability to come together whenever it is necessary 
to address the problems facing the country. 
  [Snow] Well, now can we look at what you are promising the 
electorate. Let's first start on the question of violence. 
What is the ANC going to do in government to try to contain 
what is happening in the townships, particularly amongst young 
people where it is practically out of control? 
  [Mandela] Well, again that is not a correct impression 
because although the young people are angry and are justified in 
being angry, they are at the same disciplined -- when you give 
them a lead they listen and they follow. As for the question of 
violence -- after a democratic government has been installed, a 
government which has state power and which has got the will to 
put an end to the violence will receive the support of the 
population. Our problem is that we are dealing with a lame duck 
president and government who is completely weak, and unruly 
elements have taken advantage of that. 
  [Snow] On the economic front, Mr. Mandela, the ANC has a 
close relationship with the Communist Party of South Africa; it 
has talked of nationalization, of redistribution in the past. 
What is the economic policy briefly to be? 
  [Mandela] Well, I think as far as the question of the 
Communist Party is concerned, that is a nonissue as far as we 
are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it. As far 
as our economic policy is concerned we are not following any 
particular model. Our concern is to have sufficient resources 
to address the basic needs of our people, like the high level of 
unemployment, lack of housing, education, and medical 
facilities, electricity, lack of running water, roads -- all 
those things. Any particular strategy which will enable us to 
address these problems we will adopt. 
  [Snow] Well, now can I just touch upon what happens with 
Winnie Mandela after the election. She is very well placed to 
get a good cabinet position in the post-independent government, 
in the multiracial government. What kind of reassurances can 
you give people -- given that she has had to face such serious 
charges under the old regime? 
  [Mandela] She is a very popular figure and I think that any 
government when it decides on allocating portfolio's will 
consider the influence which a particular individual commands. 
  [Snow] Well, can I just ask you finally about yourself. we 
are talking at six o'clock in the morning. I gather you have 
been up already for an hour and a half, obviously you are 
extremely fit but an enormous amount depends on you. This is 
going to be a most exhausting campaign. 
  [Mandela] Well, as soon as I have finished with this 
interview I am going to take my coat and walk to the game 
reserve. That is where I am going to relax for the next five 
days. We are trying to find opportunities, in the midst of a 
very heavy program, of relaxing and resting, and I think that 
will enable me to go through some of the strenuous assignments 
which I would be given during the next three months. 
  [Snow] I gather that before we talked this morning you have 
already been through a regime which is pretty similar to that 
which you used to undertake in prison? 
  [Mandela] Well, I was explaining just the other day that 
this 
is something that is part of our system, not because I have 
wanted to but because of the experiences I have had, and to that 
extent I am grateful that I am able to get up as early as 
possible and do some solid work before others start. 
  [Snow] Do you not feel terribly exhausted at the end of the 
day? 
  [Mandela] There are days, of course, when I do feel tired, 
but generally speaking at the end of the day I have got a 
feeling of accomplishment that I have done a good day's work 
which has been productive and that is very inspiring indeed, and 
you go back feeling that your day has been worthwhile, and you 
have done some good for the country and for your people. 
  [Snow] They say you are 76 -- it is hard to believe. How old 
do you feel? 
  [Mandela] Well, they say that old age is part of your 
spirit, 
and if you think you are young you will naturally feel young, if 
you feel you are old and defeated you will feel old and aged. 
And I try to think I am younger than I am.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 24 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana police 
detained and tortured four African National Congress [ANC] 
Eastern Transvaal officials before releasing them on Sunday, the 
ANC's region claimed on Monday. Homeland police spokesman Col 
Dave George could not immediately confirm or deny the claim, 
saying officers did not enter brief detentions for questioning 
into a common register. 
  The ANC Eastern Transvaal region said in a statement deputy 
regional secretary Phillip Radebe, his driver Mandla Mholongo, 
and regional organisers Ephraim Mogale and Piet Mello were 
arrested at Moretele 2 on Sunday and taken to Hammanskraal 
security offices. 
  They were interrogated, kicked, punched, burnt with 
cigarettes and warned not to set foot in Bophuthatswana again, 
and were then released. 
  The four had gone to Marapyane village at Moretele 2 to 
attend an ANC meeting. Voter education material such as 
calenders, pamphlets, stickers, ballot papers and personal 
notebooks were confiscated, the ANC said. 
  Col George said the men should forward their complaints 
through police headquarters or lawyers.

<F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 24 SAPA -- South Africa would not 
stand to benefit a great deal from being classified as a 
developing country under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, according to a director of the GATT Secretariat. Speaking 
in Johannesburg on Monday, negotiations services division 
director David Hartridge said the terms of tariff preferences 
for developing countries in GATT had been exaggerated. 
  "Those developing countries which have grown fastest are 
those most exposed to world markets," he said. "Preferences can 
be withheld from any country and can be withdrawn at any time, 
and they have tended to be least generous for products where 
developing countries are competitive suppliers." 
  South Africa has considered seeking a reclassification of 
its 
GATT status as a developed-country to a developing-country as 
its economy is heavily dependent upon primary exports and 
imports of capital goods. However, he said that some sectors of 
the country's economy were highly competitive, and it had 
advanced infrastructure and strong financial and educational 
institutions. 
  The United States and other developed countries have 
resisted 
South Africa's reclassification as it is one of the world's top 
30 trading nations. Mr Hartridge said instead South Africa 
should seek to integrate itself more fully in the world economy 
through increasing trade liberalisation. 
  "The best strategy might be to strengthen bilateral 
relationships with major trading partners... rather than to rely 
on developing-country status as a claim to preferential 
treatment." The country would not only enjoy better access to 
foreign markets but also, more importantly, the beneficial 
effects of competition and stable trade policies on the 
efficiency of the economy. 
  The GATT Secretariat has estimated South Africa's average 
tariff reduction, according to its offer, would be 28 per cent 
and the tariff structure considerably simplified. Mr Hartridge 
said this would greatly benenfit the country's manufacturing 
sector: "It is very hard to plan and cost production when the 
price of essential imports can be raised at any time in response 
to demands for protection from inefficient local suppliers."

  [Text] Umtata Jan 25 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] 
National Director of Publicity Waters Toboti on Tuesday warned 
of chaos if he were to be suspended from the organisation for 
speaking out of turn. He told Radio Transkei he had not been 
told about his suspension, nor had he received any 
correspondence on the matter. 
  The PAC on Saturday suspended three members -- Mr Toboti, 
Central Transkei Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha and Azanian 
National Youth League member Chargin Mabaso -- with immediate 
effect for violating procedures by raising party issues with the 
media. 
  Mr Toboti Said: "It is very easy to start chaos and 
difficult to stop it. I don't want to participate in the death 
of the PAC. If they suspend me then 'die poppe sal dans' ('the 
sparks will fly')". 
  He said he had been tried and convicted by PAC Secretary 
General Benny Alexander on the advice of "thugs". The PAC said 
it would comment later on Tuesday.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 24 SAPA -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] on Monday sharply criticised African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela for saying his organisation 
should "consider" allowing all parties to campaign in townships. 
DP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] election spokesman 
Lester Fuchs said Mr Mandela's weak endorsement of free and fair 
elections was not shared by certain prominent ANC and South 
African national civics organisation members on the ANC 
election list. 
  "Khabisi Mosunkuthu, Dan Mofokeng and Moses Mayekiso have 
all 
indicated the DP will not be allowed to canvass in the 
townships," he said in a statement. He said that if Mr Mandela 
was serious about a free and fair election he should remove from 
the ANC's election list the names of all those not committed to 
allowing other parties to campaign in townships.

faces to politics. Unlike the ANC, the NP will not draw up a 
consolidated national list. Each province will have a list for 
the national assembly and for the provincial government.

<H3>  National Party Accuses a Devious SACP of 
Concealing the Truth </H3>
  The constitutional clause which determines that once members 
have been elected to Parliament under the banner of one party, 
they have to resign if they leave the party or switch parties 
means in practise that the ANC [African National Congress] and 
the SACP [South African Communist Party] will not be able to go 
their separate ways after the election. 
  The SACP and the ANC are now locked together as a single 
entity for the full duration of the next term of parliament. 
ANC denials that the SACP is playing an important role in the 
ANC and will continue to do so, do not take this reality into 
account. 
  According to National Party information, the following 
people 
amongst the first 50 on the candidates list, have been members 
of the SACP until recently: 
  Joe Slovo; John Nkadimeng; Essop Pahad; Jay Naidoo; Raymond 
Suttner; Ahmed Kathrada; Tito Mboweni; Ronnie Kasrils; Thenjiwe 
Mthintso; Sydney Mufamadi; Blade Nzimande; Thozamile Botha; Aziz 
Pahad; Steve Tshwete; Penuell Maduna; Jeff Hadebe; Billy Nair; 
Dullah Omar; Philip Dexter; Moses Mayekiso; Alfed Nzo; Chris 
Dlamini; Alec Erin; Gertrude Shope; Gill Marcus; Mohammed Valli 
Moosa; Peter Mokaba 
  Apart from these names there are six more possibilities. 
  The SACP is now desparately attempting to conceal the facts. 
For example the statement that Mr Ahmed Kathrada's membership 
has expired years ago is simply not true. On 7 January - just 
over two weeks ago - Mr Essop Pahad SACP NEC [National Executive 
Committee] member stated openly (CITIZEN 7 January 1994) that Mr 
Kathrada is still a member of the SACP. It is quite clear that 
the ANC is now embarking on a strategy to conceal the full 
extent of their influence in the ANC and on the ANC's candidates 
list.

<F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 24 SAPA -- The SA [South African] 
Communist Party [SACP] on Monday denied a National Party [NP] 
claim that there had been a spate of "strategic resignations" 
from the SACP recently to hide its influence on the African 
National Congress [ANC] in the future parliament. 
  At a media briefing in Johannesburg, the SACP said 16 of the 
top 50 candidates on the ANC parliamentary list were SACP 
members and not 27 as claimed by the NP at the weekend. SACP 
Central Committee member Jeremy Cronin challenged the NP to 
produce proof of any other SACP members on the ANC list of 200 
candidates for the national assembly. 
  He said there had been a "flurry of resignations" from the 
SACP in 1990 after it was unbanned, but none since. He denied 
there were any "sleeping party members". The SACP produced a 
copy of the ANC list of candidates with the names of 34 SACP 
members marked. 
  Mr Cronin admitted SACP members made up an "embarrassing" 16 
of the top 50 on the ANC list, but stressed these members had 
achieved their positions in terms of their records as activists. 
  SACP Central Committee members who briefed the media were at 
pains to point out there had never been a SACP candidate list. 
"Early last year we decided not to have a list, but to rely on a 
democratic and open (selection) process," Mr Cronin said. 
  The ANC candidate list released last week had been adjusted, 
Mr Cronin revealed. This had been done to ensure a third of the 
nominees were women and that members of groups such as the 
ANC-led Patriotic Front, Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade 
Unions] and the ANC Youth League were adequately represented. 
However, the first 85 names on the list were in the order of 
the number of votes they had received. 
  The list was topped by ANC President Nelson Mandela, 
followed 
by Cyril Ramaphosa, Thabo Mbeki, Joe Slovo, Pallo Jordan and Jay 
Naidoo. The SACP had three names in the top 10: Mr Slovo, 
Ronnie Kasrils and Sydney Mufamadi. 
  Former known SACP members such as Ahmed Kathrada and Mac 
Maharaj no longer belonged to the party, the media was told. Mr 
Kathrada had allowed his membership to lapse and Mr Maharaj had 
not rejoined the party when he re-entered politics after a break 
in 1990. 
  SACP members elected to Parliament on the ANC ticket would 
be 
bound by it, Mr Cronin said. He said according to the new 
constitution, party members were not allowed to cross the floor 
to form a separate political bloc or to join another party 
without losing their parliamentary seat. 
  He admitted there was a risk the SACP could lose its 
identity, but it was a necessary risk. "The key thing (after 
the April 27 election) is to unify South Africa." 
  Fellow Central Committee member Essop Pahad said a decision 
to form a separate party caucus had not been taken. He expected 
a healthy debate among ANC parliamentarians, and if not the SACP 
would "manufacture" one.

  [Text] The first names of the most prominent leaders of the 
alternative right-wing transitional authority announced 
yesterday led to discontent among many Orange Free State [OFS] 
right wingers. Only one of them is in this body. 
  Mr. Kobus Beyers, MP for Virginia, is the only senior member 
from the OFS. The rest are from the Transvaal. 
  All the significant right-wing leaders, including AWB 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche, 
constitute part of the right-wing transitional cabinet. CP 
[Conservative Party] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg will be the 
"president". 
  HNP [Reformed National Party] leader Jaap Marais is the only 
right-wing leader not serving in the transitional authority. 
  Our correspondent in Bloemfontein reports that the OFS 
right-wing contingent, who complained yesterday, were 
particularly perturbed about the omission of OFS members such as 
Parys's MP Pieter Gous and OFS CP leader Abrie Ooosthuizen. It 
was disclosed to BEELD that Brakpan MP and the party's former 
parliamentary chief whip, Frank le Roux, is the speaker of the 
transitional authority. 
  The two deputy chairmen are Mr. Casper Uys, MP for 
Barberton, 
and Reverend Mossie van den Berg, chairman of Radio Pretoria. 
  MP for Brits, Mr. Andrew Gerber, is the chief whip. 
  The other whips are Mr. Karel Schoeman, MP for Nigel; Mr. 
Daan du Plessis, MP for Roodeplaat; and Mr. Beyers. 
  BEELD has also been told that the AVF's [Afrikaner National 
Front] Executive Committee, composed of 12 members, will form 
the cabinet with the four members of the Directorate of Generals 
of the AVF. 
  The Executive Committee consists of Dr. Hartzenberg -- 
chairman; Dr. Willie Snyman, CP deputy leader; Mr. Fanie van der 
Westhuizen of Pretoria as treasurer; Mr. Jurg Prinsloo, MP for 
Roodepoort; Mr. Jan Hoon, MP for Kuruman; Mr. Dries Bruwer, MP 
for Lydenburg and chairman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union; 
Mr. Cor de Jager of the Mine Workers' Union; Mr. Nic Celliers, 
director of the Iron and Steel Trade Union; Mr. Terreblanche; 
Prof. Ben van Rensburg, president of the Transvaal Municipal 
Association; Dr. Wally Grant; and Mr. Douw Steyn of Nelspruit. 
  The directorate consists of General Constand Viljoen who is 
chairman, Lieut. General Kobus Visser; and Major General Tienie 
Groenewald. 
  Closer cooperation regarding the "cabinet" and the 
"ministers'" portfolios will be announced at a rally on 27 
January in Pretoria. Representatives from about 200 city 
councils, who have already expressed their approval for an 
Afrikaner homeland, will also be present.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 24 SAPA -- The Kingdom of Jordan and 
South Africa would soon exchange ambassadors, Jordanian Senate 
leader Ahmad al-Lawzi said after meeting South African Foreign 
Minister Pik Botha on Monday. The Jordanian Government leader is 
heading a Jordanian delegation on a visit to South Africa to 
reciprocate Mr Botha's visit to the Arab state last year. Mr 
al-Lawzi was speaking after a luncheon hosted by Mr Botha. 
  Mr Botha said the two countries would establish a joint 
committee to investigate areas of co-operation in the fields of 
agriculture, trade, commerce, mining and culture. Mr Botha said 
he had been impressed by Jordan's economic recovery in the 
aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War when 300,000 jobless Jordanians 
who returned to their homeland had to be accommodated 
economically. 
  Mr al-Lawzi said his government wanted to take the 
initiative 
in setting up ambassadorial ties with South Africa. One of his 
aides said Jordan was looking for a suitable property for its 
ambassador who would arrive in South Africa within weeks.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "End-game for </F>
negotiations" -- article published in English] 
  [Text] The visit by the Zulu monarch, King Zwelithini 
Goodwill Zulu, to the State President in Pretoria this Monday 
brought a healthy dose of realism to the political scene. 
  It is difficult to imagine how anybody could believe that 
the 
200-year old Kingdom, the mightiest in Africa, could simply 
vanish. But that is exactly what would have happened -- on paper 
at least -- in terms of the deals President de Klerk and his 
chosen partners in the SACP [South African Communist Party]/ANC 
[African National Congress] alliance had secretly struck. Not 
even the name of KwaZulu appeared in the constitution they had 
cooked up together. Well, he seems to have now understood the 
implications of what his communist negotiating partners had 
hoodwinked him into accepting. He was, by all accounts, 
prepared to go to almost any lengths to accommodate the King and 
his Kingdom. 
  Was it the 50,000 people on the lawn outside his office that 
focused his mind, or was it the rather blunt dressing down he 
got from the King? 
  Either way, there was another important lesson to be learnt 
from Monday's events. It is that the self determination of 
peoples is a reality that will play a decisive role in our 
future. The Zulu people issued a blunt warning that their 
rights will be ignored at the country's peril. 
  Pretoria seemed to have grasped the lesson. But it is a fair 
bet that the ANC's jockey, the SACP, will never learn the 
lesson. It will stick to its class analysis, no matter what. 
The government still has it within its power to ensure that 
sanity prevails. If its fails now there will be conflict. And 
the NP [National Party] government will not escape the blame.

  [Text] The dilemma created by Radio Pretoria's continuing 
broadcasts received attention at the highest level today. 
President de Klerk discussed the controversial station's future 
with telecommunications minister, Piet Welgemoed, and Post 
Master General Ters Oosthuizen. They haven't issued a statement 
yet. 
  Radio Pretoria was still broadcasting today four days after 
the supreme court had ordered the Afrikaner Kultuurbond 
[Cultural League] to get the station off the air. The 
Kultuurbond lodged an application this morning to appeal against 
the court order. A date for hearing the application has still 
to be fixed. 
  At Radio Pretoria' Donkerhoek premises the station is 
guarded 
round the clock. Last week two officials of the Post Master 
General's Office were turned back at the gate. Mr. Oosthuizen 
says the officials did in fact have the necessary know-how for 
sealing the transmitter, but they were not allowed in.

  [Text] The Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] is to 
establish its own radio station, possibly as early as the middle 
of next month. The Volksfront has recently bought 13 steel 
high- tension masts from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], 
which it will convert into radio transmission antennas. Its 
planned FM service will stretch from Hartbeesfontein in the 
western Transvaal, through the Orange Free State to 
Bloemfontein, and from there to Upington in the northern Cape. 
  In addition to Radio Pretoria, which is still broadcasting 
illegally, four radio transmitters were recently set up in the 
Orange Free State, and a fifth is being built in Bethlehem. 
According to an Eskom spokesman, the high-tension masts were 
purchased for 350 rands each, possibly at an auction or by 
tender.

  [Text] Cape Town Jan 25 SAPA -- The South African Police 
[SAP] has again appealed to former members to re-join the force 
to provide sufficient manpower for the April 27 elections. SAP 
Public Relations head Maj-Gen Leon Mellet said in a statement on 
Tuesday it was of the utmost importance that as many competent 
former SAP members as possible be reinstated. "Every available 
member will be required for duty over the next few months," he 
said. Gen Mellet urged interested former SAP members to 
approach their nearest manpower acquisition office for further 
information. He said the appeal was not aimed at members who 
had retired at pensionable age, those who had taken early 
retirement or had retired for medical reasons.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Clear ANC Economic Policy Required -- "As the outflow of 
capital increases alarmingly, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals 
calls on the ANC [African National Congress] to help staunch the 
flow," notes a page 20 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 25 January. "What is required, he says, is a final 
and clear statement on the organisation's economic policies. 
Many of South Africa's older citizens would also like the ANC's 
comment on disturbing speculation that a new government will 
scrap a major tax concession on retirement annuities. Stals is 
right: uncertainty is contributing to the flood, and the ANC 
should speak loud and clear before it is too late." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC Policy Contribution to Balance of Payments Exaggerated 
-- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 25 January in a page 8 
editorial notes that Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals "blamed 
uncertainty over the ANC's economic policy for most of the 
R[rand]10bn [billion] outflow" in the second half of 1993. 
According to Stals the "pre-election ANC ambiguity could worsen 
the haemorrhage on the capital account of the balance of 
payments. But Stals is probably exaggerating the contribution 
of ANC economic policy -- or lack of it -- to balance of 
payments problems." "Most foreign banks do not want to make 
commitments beyond April," but the reason for that "probably has 
more to do with political stability than with ANC economic 
policy." So the ANC will be careful about responding to Stals's 
call for a clearer ANC economic policy, "as it balances the risk 
of losing votes with the knowledge that no major turnaround in 
the balance of payments can be expected until after the 
election. It should nevertheless place more emphasis on its 
commitment to financial discipline." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  S. Africa Able To Influence Events in Lesotho -- South 
African Foreign Minister Pik Botha's "smugness over what is 
happening in Lesotho is discomforting," declares a page 8 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 25 January. 
"South Africa was involved in the various military governments 
that have affected that kingdom's fortunes. There is no doubt 
that South Africa is able to influence events in Lesotho in 
various ways. It can close the border gates and, at best, can 
send in armed forces to help Mokhehle. There is no need for 
Botha to be so smarmy about the misfortunes currently befalling 
this unhappy country." 
  Furore Over 'Communists' on ANC Election List -- A second 
editorial on the same page says the "furore over the number of 
SACP [South African Communist Party] members in the ANC's 
parliamentary list is amusing but shows the hard ball that will 
be played in events running up to the elections." In the 
election fight the ANC's opponents will "deliberately forget or 
ignore the fact that the link with the SACP goes back many 
years. There will be an attempt to use the communist bogeyman 
to scare white voters from the organisation. And while all this 
is quite silly, it will be the way in which the elections are to 
be fought." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Zulu Leaders Must Reconsider Boycott Strategy -- 
Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 January says in a page 8 editorial: 
"When King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi began to beat the ethnic drums last year over the 
so-called elimination of the Zulus, BEELD warned that fires were 
being fanned which could be difficult to douse." "The stayaway 
action which was planned as a show of strength to coincide with 
the king's meeting with the state president was purportedly not 
arranged by Mr. Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, but that is 
purely academic. The IFP leader, who has always strongly 
opposed any stayaways and consumer boycotts by the ANC and its 
allies on account of the economic disruption caused, this time 
gloated over the Zulu nationalists' actions. The fires which 
have been fanned for the past months flared dangerously on the 
Reef in the form of vehicle hijackings, intimidation, arson, 
violence, and even loss of life. These actions by the followers 
of the two leaders will not promote their cause or win them new 
friends in the black community or even among moderate whites. 
The politically 'neutral' Zulu monarch has now been dumped 
knee-deep in the political arena -- a step he might regret. 
There is an urgent need for the two leaders to think seriously 
about their boycott strategy. It is based on incorrect facts 
and misconceptions and is being spurred on by misplaced 
political ambitions." 
  Dialogue Needed on ANC Reconstruction Plan -- A second 
editorial on page 8 points out: "There is no doubt that the 
ANC's plan for economic and social reconstruction has 
fundamental shortcomings. The question is, what must be done to 
ensure a better and more workable plan?" BEELD concludes: "We 
firmly believe there is a growing number of white South Africans 
who accept the realities of their fatherland, and understand 
that they will be asked to make sacrifices. But then the 
demands made on them must be realistic and fair, and above all 
must not be perceived as punishment. If the ANC takes note of 
that, the basis will be laid for a sober debate on an explosive 
issue." 
  `Limited Violence' Not Easily Controlled -- General Constand 
Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner National Front, AVF, speaks 
of 'limited violence' to achieve the Afrikaner homeland. He 
might believe he can keep it limited, but I am not so certain," 
argues Willie Kuhn in his "Political BEELD" column on page 10 of 
the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January. "One example 
suffices: It appears that there is an onslaught on members and 
property of the ANC in the Orange Free State. One cannot be 
sure who is responsible, but it would be surprising if it were 
not the right wing. Let's assume this pattern continues. Does 
Gen. Viljoen believe there will be no reaction? We will then be 
back in the eighties; violence begets violence." 
  Mandela Outbursts Against De Klerk `Inopportune' -- 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January in a page 10 
editorial criticizes Mandela's "two-facedness". "Mr. Mandela 
accuses President de Klerk of orchestrating violence in the 
townships with the aim of stopping the ANC from winning the 
April elections." BEELD questions why Mandela resorts to this 
when he and De Klerk are presently engaged in talks to try and 
find a solution to the violence in black townships. "Or does he 
want to wreck this peace plan for the townships?" One can 
understand that the ANC, co-responsible for "the bloody 
political battle in black townships," is eager to win the 
election, but then one at least expects a future state president 
to be more careful when talking about the present head of state. 
His unproven allegations are not promoting the political climate 
and feeds the general idea that "what he says today contradicts 
what he says the following day." This will affect his 
credibility. 
  "The first welcome fruits of joint control over the security 
forces are being reaped," notes a second editorial on the same 
page. "The ANC's announcement that a campaign is to be launched 
in unrest areas on the East Rand to 'educate' residents to 
accept the police and Defense Force and to stop attacks on them, 
is a direct result of the extensive democratization process 
currently underway in the country." "The sooner other 
organizations copy this example, the quicker the quality of life 
will improve for all South Africans." The ANC should, however, 
refrain from creating the perception that the security forces 
are an extension of any particular political grouping, for this 
will only exacerbate existing problems. "Ultimately, it is the 
community in general that must make the security forces feel 
welcome."

  [Text] Talks may be under way in Lusaka, but the situation 
is one of war in northern Angola. Felix Miranda, the Voice of 
the Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] correspondent in 
that part of the country, said the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, General Staff continues to use 
regular forces in its offensive against the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  Last weekend, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] used its self-propelled artillery 
to shell an area northeast of Ucua, in Bengo Province, and the 
area of (Quicabo), north of Caxito. The clashes were quite 
intense, killing more than 30 civilians, wounding dozens of 
people, and destroying homes. 
  Meanwhile, Americo Chivala, the Vorgan correspondent in 
Cabinda, has reported the presence of Cuban soldiers in the area 
of N'gange. Those soldiers are ready to come into action via the 
sea and to provide support to forces deployed on land. Our 
correspondent reports that those Cuban forces are artillery and 
military engineering experts. 
  It is worth noting that the Armed Forces for the Liberation 
of Angola [FALA] Northern Command last week inspected all units 
entrenched in Uige, Zaire, and Bengo Provinces. The FALA 
Northern Command promised people in those areas that its forces 
would do everything in their power to defend the lives and 
interests of the people. 
  It has also been reported that clashes have taken place in 
Huila Province. Vorgan correspondent Silva Aleluia reports that 
the MPLA- PT air force continues to carry out air raids against 
UNITA-controlled areas. Meanwhile, the FAPLA forces left the 
city of Lubango on 21 January in the direction of Cacula and are 
now waiting for reinforcements. Silva Aleluia also reports that 
the number of people killed as a result of shelling on 20 
January has now risen to 14. More than 20 people were seriously 
wounded. As in northern Angola, the FALA Huila Province Command 
has already taken the necessary passive and active measures to 
defend the people.

  [Text] The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] movement of Angola has accused the Angolan Government 
of carrying out fresh attacks and said such action is 
compromising the Angolan peace talks taking place in the Zambian 
capital, Lusaka. 
  UNITA's information secretary, Mr. Jorge Valentin, said the 
atmosphere at the United Nations, the mediator of talks which 
began in November, had been positive so far, but said government 
actions were creating mistrust and pessimism among negotiators. 
Mr. Valentin said the peace talks which had led to agreements 
in principle on various military and legal matters would be 
interrupted if the international community did not speak out 
against an increase in government military action.

  [Excerpt] There are new developments to the war in Angola, 
notably the massive presence of Cuban soldiers. At this stage, 
intense clashes are taking place in the areas of Ucua and 
Ambriz, in Bengo Province. In view of this aggression, the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] were called on 
to defend the people. The FALA commander for the Northern 
Region has already inspected National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] army units so that they can now 
defend the people, who are always the principal victims, 
whatever war it may be. Felix Miranda, the Voice of Resistance 
of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the area, reports: 
  [Begin Miranda recording] Intense clashes continue in the 
areas of Ucua and Ambriz. In the face of the war situation 
imposed by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA- PT] air force and [words indistinct] 
it cannot be said that [words indistinct] but people continue to 
perish by the dozens. Many seek refuge in their farming areas, 
but to no avail, because bombs follow them there. The people 
are the principal targets sought by the MPLA-PT troops. 
According to a military source, the UNITA troops continue to 
put up great resistance to the enemy whose ranks this time 
include a new element: Cuban forces. 
  Despite this scenario, FALA armed forces day was celebrated 
in Zaire Province on 24 January. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] Reports from Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, say 
Portuguese police are cooperating with their Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] counterparts. 
Reports even say that Portuguese police are preparing to 
compete with Spanish in the training of personnel and, if 
possible, to reequip the MPLA-PT's Riot Police. 
  The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel learned from 
reliable sources today that a Portuguese National Republican 
Guard, GNR, team made up of two senior officers visited Luanda 
earlier this month to discuss concrete cooperation proposals. 
This source also disclosed that (?10) MPLA-PT policemen left 
for the Portuguese capital soon afterward and are currently 
undergoing training at the GNR Training Center. 
  Observers believe that Portugal and Spain are already 
involved in a war of influence over the Angolan police force. 
  One thing is certain: In the midst of all this, the Angolan 
people do not have food, but they can now count on a beefed-up 
police corps, which should ensure intensified intimidation and 
repression.

  [Text] The Angolan Human Rights Association has described 
as worrisome the conditions experienced by political and other 
prisoners in Luanda's jails. That association says that some 60 
people perish in jail every month because of the subhuman 
conditions they face. Many succumb to physical brutality, 
others because of physical exhaustion caused by terrible hygiene 
conditions in jail. 
  In a report it published recently, the Angolan Human Rights 
Association noted that there were many detainees who had not 
been charged but who were serving long sentences. No health 
care is given, even though serious and contagious diseases are 
common in those jails. 
  In the third quarter of last year, an Assembly of the 
Republic team visited the jails and found the situation there to 
be cause for much concern. At the time, that team promised to 
work to improve the situation, but nothing has changed so far. 
  According to a source here in Jamba, that situation benefits 
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
whose idea it was to order the construction of those jails.

  [Text] Corruption is running rampant within the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] 
government's ruling clique and it continues to be widely 
reported by various Angolan circles. 
  COMERCIO E ACTUALIDADE magazine, which is published in 
Luanda, yesterday described as corrupt three ministers in the 
government headed by Marcolino Moco. Those ministers are: 
Agriculture Minister Isaac dos Anjos, Territorial 
Administration Minister Paulo Kassoma, and Norberto dos Santos, 
minister for assistance and social reintegration. COMERCIO E 
ACTUALIDADE magazine also reports that those three government 
officials have formed a building society that participated in 
the construction of four factories on the outskirts of Luanda 
costing the Angolan Treasury some $10 million. 
  That magazine also accused Agriculture Minister Isaac dos 
Anjos of having received a large commission from the recent 
importation of farming tractors. 
  In addition to these developments, Roberto de Almeida, an 
MPLA-PT deputy to the National Assembly, has asked the 
government to open an inquiry into the recent importation of 300 
Mercedes Benz vehicles intended for Luanda government officials. 
Roberto de Almeida described that measure as irresponsible and 
counterproductive in view of the country's current situation, 
marked by a deeply impoverished economy, serious food shortages, 
and a very high inflation rate.

  [Text] Three Angolan Government ministers have embezzled 
public funds including 10 million dollars intended for building 
four (?separate) factories in Luanda. 
  An independent business magazine, the weekly commercial 
ACTUALIDADE, alleged that the three ministers have set up a real 
estate company and three other funds with an Angolan businessman 
nicknamed as Mr. (Antonio Mosquito). The men accused of 
embezzlement were Agriculture Minister Isaac dos Anjos, 
Territorial Administration Minister Paulo Kassoma, and Minister 
of Assistance and Social Reintegration Norbeto dos Santos. 
  Similar charges were laid against the three during a session 
of the Central Committee of the ruling MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola] which suspended a corruption 
debate on 21 December.

  [Text] At long last, those Angolans who had sought refuge 
in the FRG have finally received permission to reside there. 
The Federal Parliament met in Berlin on 20 January and approved 
a proposal by the United Greens Party 90 requesting political 
asylum for slightly more than 600 Angolan citizens who had 
sought refuge in the FRG. Only a few days ago, it looked 
unlikely that they would obtain such permission because of 
differences among the country's authorities. 
  The stance adopted by the Federal Parliament in Berlin has 
done much to resolve the problems of Angolan refugees in that 
country. It comes in the wake of a tug of war between the 
senator for home affairs in Berlin and (?15) Angolans who had 
sought refuge with Catholic and Protestant churches. 
  Human rights organizations across the world have praised the 
stand adopted by the Federal Parliament in Berlin, adding that 
it has greatly lessened the dangers faced by those Angolans 
because of the Luanda regime's policy of tribal genocide and 
extermination of all people who do not fall in with its 
political views.

<F P=106> [ From the "Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel" </F>
program] 
  [Text] We are in 1994. The present state of the Angolan 
industry is truly gloomy and worrisome because of an almost 
total paralyzation of productive activity during 1993, reducing 
production levels to less than 30 percent. This situation, 
created by the destruction of infrastructure, lack of raw 
materials, and the obsolete state of equipment, caused major 
imbalances in the present economy, which is characterized by an 
ever increasing inflation. 
  The occupation of some industrial areas by the warmongering 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], 
such as Huambo, the second biggest industrial province in the 
country, influenced to a large extent the low level of 
production registered during 1993, particularly in the fields of 
food, beverages, and confection. 
  In financial terms, the industrial sector received $35.4 
million for operational programs on a quarterly basis, but the 
Angolan industrial sector needs $700 million for its 
rehabilitation. Of the $35.4 million, more than $8 million were 
used to obtain raw materials, mainly wheat and corn flour, 
yeast, and wheat grain. The remaining amount was given to 
companies that had raw materials but needed other essentials to 
produce commodities. 
  Importing raw materials served as a foundation for the 
Angolan Industrial Association to hold trade fairs to exhibit 
products produced in the country. Strategies and priorities to 
reorganize and develop Angolan entrepreneurship and 
privatizations were defined in 1993, although the process has 
been moving slowly. Measures liberalizing prices and giving 
management autonomy where possible, were also implemented. 
Thus, work is under way to transform state units into 
commercial elements. There are still some difficulties. These 
include the fact that an adequate economic atmosphere does not 
exist, the need for a consolidated and experienced 
entrepreneurship, as well as shortage of equipment, financial 
resources, technology, and management. 
  In the very short-term, the fundamental objective is to be 
able to increase the utilization of available resources in the 
fields of industry, capital, and labor, thus guaranteeing 
minimum levels of efficiency. Accordingly, the government's 
strategy in 1994 should be to make use of good points and 
eliminate weak points. Good points are an abundance of natural 
resources, excellent conditions to obtain energy at low prices, 
the geopolitical situation, and the agricultural, livestock, and 
fishery [word indistinct]. Weak points would be the war 
situation, the destroyed industrial sector, excessive 
bureaucracy and restrictions to free initiative, the shortage of 
modern and trained national entrepreneurs to carry out 
productive activities, and restrictions to foreign investment, 
among other things. 
  The prevalence of restrictions and limitations, viewed as 
weak points, must have evidently affected the rate of the 
utilization of productive capacity, which was less than 30 
percent during 1993. The manufaturing industry was one of the 
sectors with serious reductions. Thus, its production, after 
suffering a 75 percent decline from 1975 to 1976, experienced an 
increase from 1977 to 1983, and once again a decline from 1985 
to 1994. 
  Employment in the manufacturing industry decreased from 
200,000 in 1970's to less than 70,000 in 1993. To reduce the 
high rate of unemployment, the government must define some 
strategic parameters to formulate a re-industrialization plan. 
Hence, there is a need to draw up a program with general and 
specific actions, such as guaranteeing a minimum production 
program for viable food industries. There is also a need to 
encourage production in heavy industry, which is currently 
experiencing a small injection of fresh money to advance forward 
and to adopt measures aimed at improving the efficiency of the 
enterprise sector and developing Angolan entrepreneurship and 
privatization. 
  In the mining sector, the 1993 production results were below 
the planned levels because the vast and rich diamond-producing 
areas were paralyzed, following their occupation by UNITA 
warmongering forces led by Dr. Jonas Malheiro. In view of this 
situation, the production by the Angola National Diamond 
Enterprise [Endiama] totalled 20,000 monthly [words indistinct], 
50 percent of normal activity at Lucapa and Zage, presently 
known as Andrada. 
  During the first six months of this year [as heard], Endiama 
saw its production reduced $300 million, because the Cuango 
diamond area in Lunda Norte Province was paralyzed. Illegal 
diamond trafficking reached alarming proportions, to the value 
of $500 million, forcing the government to adopt urgent measures 
to halt it. These measures included restricting people's 
movement in areas with the most diamond activity. What is more, 
proposals by foreign investors to exploit other minerals, such 
as granite, marble, and lime, particularly in southern Angola, 
cannot be realized because of the war imposed on us by UNITA's 
warmongering wing, led by Dr. Jonas Savimbi.

  [Text] The situation in Maseru continues to be quiet but 
tense, and some shops and firms around the city were closed 
before midday today following yesterday's heavy shooting between 
the warring factions of the armed forces. Many workers returned 
home early for fear of being hit by stray bullets lest the 
fighting resumes. However, the minister of information and 
broadcasting has appealed to workers to carry out their normal 
duties and not rely on misleading reports by foreign media. 
  Following the army feud, property and many residential 
houses 
in Maseru have been hit by stray bullets. The areas affected 
are: (Koadeng, Kwasaneng, Haramehedi, Apatoemi) [word 
indistinct] hospital and (Hatsulu). 
  As the situation continues to reach high proportions, the 
prime minister, the Right Honorable Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, has held 
meetings with the representative of the Organization of African 
Unity, OAU, Mr. Joe Legwaila, church leaders as well as 
political leaders, in a bid to seek a solution to the crisis. 
  The honorable minister of health and social welfare, Dr. 
Khauhelo Ralitapole, says 11 civilians have been injured 
following the skirmishes between two factions of the Royal 
Lesotho Defense Force. She said this today, after inspecting 
damage at the National Health Training Center, NHTC, adding that 
the amount of damage caused will take the government some time 
to repair. Dr. Ralitapole said nurse trainees had been 
evacuated last Saturday to the Lesotho Cooperatives Center, 
while patients of Botsabelo and Mohlomi had been transferred to 
Mofokeng and Queen Elizabeth II hospitals respectively. She 
reiterated the prime minister's appeal to the warring factions 
to lay down their arms. 
  Speaking at the same inspection, the director of NHTC, Mrs. 
L. (Maguthu) appealed to nurses nearer to these hospitals that 
have admitted these patients to go and help. After this 
inspection Dr. Ralitapole visited the injured at the Queen 
Elizabeth II Hospital.

  [Text] Reports from Maseru say many foreign nationals quit 
the Lesotho capital in compliance with warnings from their 
embassies amid rumors that rebel troops were preparing for new 
offensives against loyalists military positions. The embassies 
were also evacuating non-essential staff across the border to 
neighboring South Africa after fierce gunfire and mortar 
exchanges yesterday between the rebel army factions. Scores of 
expatriates and local families were seen fleeing Maseru. The 
Education Ministry ordered schools closed today. 
  While life returned to relative calm in the streets after 
yesterday's skirmishes, many people heeded a warning to remain 
indoors broadcast over Radio Lesotho. Loyalist soldiers grouped 
at Makoanyane Military Base on a hill overlooking Maseru were 
seen today positioning armored vehicles on the hillside.

  [Text] There is still an uneasy calm in Maseru today 
following a weekend of renewed battles between two rival 
military factions. A Lesotho Government spokesman said all 
attempts to get the warring factions around the table had failed. 
  Mr. Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, says that at 
this stage he is not considering sending the military into 
Lesotho, but that South African soldiers are being deployed 
along the border to monitor events. Mr. Botha emphasized that 
South Africa would not recognize a new Lesotho Government that 
came into power by a coup, adding that South Africa will even 
consider imposing sanctions against it. 
  [Begin Botha recording in English] There may be politics 
behind this. There may even be an attempted coup behind the 
present trouble in Lesotho and that is why I made it clear to 
the Lesotho people, and to the defense force, that this 
government will under no circumstances recognize any government 
that comes into being in there in an irregular fashion, and 
particularly through violence, and that we would close the 
border. And that we would take other steps, which we can take, 
we can withhold funds from the customs pool which will make it 
impossible for a government that takes over by force, to govern 
that country successfully. [end recording] 
  Storm clouds hung over Maseru today, but for local residents 
the sound of thunder was a welcome relief from the sound of 
machine gunfire. Five soldiers have been killed since the 
fighting broke out 10 days ago. Schools in the capital were 
closed today and some shops and government offices closed early 
today. The last sound of gunfire died down at about 0000 GMT 
this morning, but there are rumors that renewed fighting could 
break out by tomorrow morning. Foreign embassies in Maseru are 
monitoring the situation closely and some are ready to evacuate 
their members if fighting resumes. 
  [Begin Gerhard Visser, South African Ambassador to Lesotho 
recording] I spoke to my staff members -- some of them have been 
here for about three years -- they told me that the present 
troubled situation is much worse than the previous coup in 1990 
when General Ramaema overthrew General Lekhanya. Because the 
present situation is so unpredictable it is really very 
difficult to make decisions without causing any panic within the 
South African Community here. [end recording] 
  Soldiers from the Royal Lesotho Defense Force headquarters 
took up positions in the hills just south of Maseru late today 
and are believed to be waiting for the soldiers from the 
Makoanyane barracks to make the next move. Mr. Leeiso Serutle, 
principal secretary of the Ministry of Information and 
Broadcasting, said today that until the two factions talked to 
the government they won't know what the fighting is really about. 
  [Begin Serutle recording in English] They wanted to take the 
government by force, and I'm not quite clear whether this is 
true or not. But, yes, your guess is as good as mine. [end

  [Text] The Lesotho Government has acknowledged that it has 
no control over two rival army factions currently fighting each 
other and says it is seeking international help to resolve the 
crisis. The Lesotho Information Ministry said that the 
government had no contact with either faction and that it was 
uncertain of their actions. It is reported that about 150 
loyalist soldiers are fighting against eight rebel companies to 
keep the ruling Basotholand Congress Party in power. Diplomatic 
sources said the United Nations, the Organization of African 
Unity, and the Commonwealth were trying to mediate a solution. 
A peace initiative is also being launched by the Frontline 
States. South African troops are keeping a close watch on the 
border, but there are no immediate plans to cross into Lesotho. 
The situation in Maseru remains tense.

  [Text] Senior officials in the Lesotho Government have 
noted with concern reports by foreign news agencies that brand 
one of the two fighting army factions in the country as rebels. 
In a statement to the South African Broadcasting Service, SABC, 
and the BBC, the government has indicated that there is but one 
army in Lesotho, the situation at present merely being that they 
are divided over whether the government should increase army 
salaries by 100 percent or not.

  [Text] Botswana's foreign minister, Legwaila wa Legwaila, 
has negotiated a truce between Lesotho's warring army factions 
in overnight talks. Lesotho's prime minister, Ntsu Mokhehle, 
said the two sides had agreed in principle to lay down their 
arms, but the situation had not yet been fully resolved. Mr. 
Legwaila, who was in the Lesotho capital on behalf of the 
Organization of African Unity, returned to Gaborone early this 
morning, leaving behind calm but tense conditions in Maseru. 
Labor and church organizations have called for a national 
stayaway from work tomorrow to protest against the death of 
three civilians, blamed on the government's mishandling of the 
crisis.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Newspapers in Malawi are stepping up the pressure on 
the government to set up a commission of inquiry into the deaths 
of three ministers and an MP 10 years ago. The campaign to 
establish the exact circumstances in which the ministers died 
has taken off since the referendum on multiparty democracy last 
year. The government says it was a simple car accident, but 
last week the issue was in the headlines again when a retired 
policeman confessed that he had been involved. Today, the 
opposition MALAWI DEMOCRAT newspaper also jumped onto the band 
wagon, saying it has talked to a former political prisoner who 
saw the four men just hours before they disappeared. On the 
line to Lilongwe, Robin White asked the paper's editor Charles 
Simango how far they were getting with their campaign to 
establish a commission of inquiry. 
  [Begin recording] [Simango] We think we are making progress. 
The information is there -- most of it -- but the problem now is 
to get documented evidence, but the people who were actually 
involved are speaking up now. Most of them have been retired, 
of course, some top officials who actually gave the orders, 
about two, they have died. One of them died about five years 
ago, that was one of the top police officials. 
  [White] And he is dead? 
  [Simango] Yes, he is dead. 
  [White] And what you want to happen next? 
  [Simango] Well, the business can be done at the moment 
[words 
indistinct] just to see this commission of inquiry put into 
place. I think after it has come into place, I think, you know, 
evidence can start rolling out, and after that people will know 
the truth. People still believe, we believe as journalists as 
well, that it wasn't an ordinary accident, so what matters is 
knowing the truth, but as long as there isn't that commission of 
inquiry, everything we are hearing is not official. 
  [White] Now, the latest thing that you printed in your 
newspaper is the story of a former detainee who claimed that he 
saw these four dead ministers in detention the night before. 
  [Simango] Yes, Machipisa Munthali last week testified to 
this 
newspaper that he was given clothes belonging to the late Dick 
Matenje. The guard who gave him the clothes told him that the 
three ministers and one member of Parliament had been detained 
overnight at Mikuyo prison, and at that time they had been 
released. So, the late Dick Matenje had left these clothes 
behind, which the guard decided to give Machipisa Munthali to 
use, since he has been in prison for quite a long time, he has 
served 29 years. So, Machipisa had no choice, he used the 
clothes for about two years although they were oversized. 
  [White] So, he wore the clothes of one of the dead people? 
  [Simango] Yes. 
  [White] How far is your newspaper using all this just to try 
and embarrass the government? 
  [Simango] Well, if it was just trying to embarrass the 
goverment, I think this could be the least that we could go for, 
there are worse things. 
  [White] How do you mean? 
  [Simango] Well, this is just one of the incidents. It so 
happens that the people who died here were top government 
officials, you know, three cabinet ministers and one member of 
parliament. Well, that is bad enough, but people have 
disappeared, we know of people with no names, hundreds of them, 
they have just disappeared. We have letters, we receive letters 
here, others newspapers too, that so and so disappeared in 1972, 
so and so disappeared here, and up to this time we still find 
people that have been found, say, in rivers; you know, bundled 
into sack. You find a dead body in a river up to this point. 
  [White] But to what extent are you acting? Like a newspaper, 
investigating or to what extent? Are you acting as an organ for 
the opposition? 
  [Simango] I think the line there is very clear. We don't 
politicize this, we don't. [end recording]

of postwar trust with the political parties and governments of 
those countries. The Renamo leader plans to visit the United

persons to such posts. In his letter, (Mateus Mufambira) says 
he was appointed without Renamo consulting him beforehand

on the part of (Mateus Mufambira). Pensado added that 
(Mufambira's) appointment came as a result of previous contacts

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Malawi Young Pioneers Seek Political </F>
Asylum in Zimbabwe] 
  [Text] The Portuguese news agency, LUSA, reported yesterday 
that the Zimbabwean authorities announced over the weekend that 
a group of Malawian nationals, allegedly members of the "Young 
Pioneers" are seeking political asylum in Zimbabwe. 
  Commissar for Refugees Samuel Mhiribidi has confirmed the 
presence of Malawian citizens in Harare, but he said that he 
does not know whether they belong to the "Young Pioneers" group 
because none of them presented themselves as a member of this 
organization. Mhiribidi said that there are some who have not 
yet presented themselves to the authorities, but some Malawian 
nationals residing here have told us that the aforementioned 
persons are members of the "Young Pioneers". 
  Until last month, the "Young Pioneers" were the youth wing 
of 
President Kamuzu Banda's Malawi Congress Party, one of the most 
feared organizations in Malawi. 
  Charles Kadama Manga, head of consular services in the 
Malawian Embassy in Harare, told LUSA that despite the fact that 
he does not have details on the aforementioned people, it seems 
"unreasonable" to him that they are seeking political asylum in 
Zimbabwe, adding that the Malawian authorities, including 
President Banda, have appealed to the Pioneers to return to 
Malawi, promising that they would not be tried for their crimes. 
  About 7,000 Pioneers took refuge in the bush following 
violent clashes between the group and the Malawi Army that broke 
out after two soldiers were shot dead. 
  The commissar for refugees has favored the decision to 
receive the group, stating that it is the country's policy to 
shelter people who flee their countries alleging political 
persecution. Mhiribidi said that the OAU Convention stipulates 
that granting refugee status does not mean hostility toward 
one's country of origin. 
  The announcement of the presence of "Young Pioneers" in 
Zimbabwe comes less than one week after the Mozambican and 
Malawian Governments agreed on the repatriation of members of 
this organization who had penetrated the Mozambican territory. 
  The "Young Pioneers" entered Mozambique from the Milange 
border area in Zambezia Province, heading for Tete Province. It 
is believed that they headed for Tete because it is the last 
province before reaching Zimbabwe. 
  Malawi has a border with the Mozambican Provinces of Niassa, 
Zambezia and Tete, and out of these only Tete has a border with 
Zimbabwe. 
  The agreement on the repatriation of the "Pioneers" from our 
country followed a request by the Malawian authorities, after 
talks between the Joint Defense and Security Commission of the 
two countries.

<F P=106> ["Letter" by Mozambique Democratic Party President Wehia </F>
Monakacho Ripua: "Jeque is a racist, a dangerous Mozambican, and 
is not well health-wise"] 
  [Text] I read with a great deal of interest the interview 
that Dr. Carlos Jeque granted DOMINGO and that was carried in 
this newspaper's 9 January edition. Dr. Jeque took wrong, dry 
[secas], and groundless stands in the course of that interview. 
He went as far as to say that the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] government is placing blacks in the state apparatus 
while showing hostility to coloreds. 
  Personally, I would prefer not to touch this issue of blacks 
and coloreds, because I view all of them as Mozambicans; 
however, Dr. Jeque's views force me to say something about it. 
  The fact is that the majority of Mozambican citizens are 
black and that reality cannot be denied in any way. Hurt 
whoever it may, blacks are in the majority. In view of that, it 
is not and it will not be anything extraordinary to see many 
blacks working in the state apparatus. The extraordinary thing 
was that most officials in the state apparatus used to be 
whites, Indians, and coloreds when the late President Samora 
Machel headed the government and even some years after President 
Joaquim Chissano had taken over that post. 
  Those officials were and are part of the minority in 
relation 
to the country's blacks, but none of them protested it. Blacks 
did not have the right to say anything. Their sole spokesman 
was the late President Samora Machel, who was surrounded, 
dominated, and guided by the lot mentioned above. Under those 
circumstances, the country promptly fell into misery because 
none of them had any interest whatever in serving the Mozambican 
people. Eighty percent of the Mozambican economy is in the 
hands of the Indian section of society and those citizens are 
only interested in helping their own people. They have no 
interest in seeing the country develop. Their sole interest is 
money, and part of that money is already abroad, which is of no 
benefit at all to this country. 
  It will be a good thing for Dr. Carlos Jeque to grasp 
immediately that when the Mozambican people, Africa, and the 
whole world see that the majority of senior officials in the 
state apparatus are blacks they are satisfied because, given 
that blacks are in the majority, it is only legitimate that they 
should govern the country. This is no racist view, and it is not 
intended as an attack on other Mozambicans. 
  Dr. Carlos Jeque has a superiority complex in relation to 
the 
black person. If that is the case, then I am sorry for him. 
  It is completely unjust that a social minority should make 
up 
the majority of senior officials in the state apparatus. That 
is unacceptable. I am only too aware that there are some (very 
few) blacks who have been assimilated by the colonial government 
and who regard themselves as whites. Those are the people who 
continue to this day shamelessly to defend a return of 
colonialism to this country. 
  In concrete terms, what exactly is it that Dr. Jeque wants? 
Would he like whites, Indians, or coloreds to be put in the 
state apparatus instead? Would he like to see a return to the 
times when a Mozambican team sent abroad would be confused with 
an European or Asian team because it would always be made up of 
whites, Indians, and coloreds? If such a team included a black 
person, that person was bound to be the bodyguard of the team's 
leader. Dr. Carlos Jeque: Such situations did really happen 
and should not be repeated. 
  By the same token, you cannot demand, for instance, that the 
senior officials in the Portuguese state apparatus be black 
Portuguese citizens. Neither can you demand that in the United 
States, Great Britain, France, and so forth. To me, it is 
absurd to deny a government of the majority. 
  Blacks are not racist here in Mozambique. Quite the 
contrary, in fact: They are against racism. Racism was 
instituted by the colonialists against our ancestors and it 
lasted to the day of our independence. When blacks defend 
themselves against racism today, the creators of racism turn 
around and accuse blacks of being racist. They want blacks to 
shut up so they can continue to stay on top and make blacks the 
usual targets for racism. Blacks will never agree to that, or 
they would never have fought for independence. 
  Mozambique's indigenous section of the population always 
came 
last during the entire colonial period. There were those who 
dreamed that, after independence from the Portuguese, the 
Indians and coloreds would take over and the blacks would 
continue to occupy the same place they did before independence. 
That type of dream is also in Dr. Jeque's mind. Dr. Jeque does 
not wish to see a government of black people because, in his 
opinion, black people have never known anything. 
  Our party, the Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo, fights 
and will always mercilessly fight that sort of mentality. 
Today, racists are going underground and are beginning to show 
their teeth. They act as though they are good people in a bid to 
regain the trust they lost among the indigenous population so 
they can attract votes during the elections. 
  Dr. Carlos Jeque has felt he has not been getting moral 
support from his colleagues in the Fumo leadership and other 
people because of his cynicism, vanity, and superiority complex. 
That was what caused his isolation and his subsequent 
resignation from his post as deputy Fumo chairman. Dr. Jeque is 
a half-hidden colored armed with a colonial mentality and racism 
against black persons. To me he is a dangerous Mozambican 
because of his racism. 
  At one point in his interview, Dr. Carlos Jeque said that 
"the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] had adopted an 
inflexible stand because it sought to get involved in a tug of 
war with another inflexible party, the government. That led to 
certain less informed political parties misreading those 
positions and leaning more toward Renamo." 
  That passage is false in its entirety. The group of eight 
unarmed parties understood quite well what they were doing. 
Renamo may be an armed party but it is in the opposition. 
Personally, I do not see Dr. Carlos Jeque as an opposition 
leader. To me Dr. Jeque is not well, health-wise. He always 
looks bothered. In view of that, it would be a good thing for 
him to give up on politics altogether and turn to simpler things. 
  My advice to those who are not satisfied with a majority 
government is that they should choose some country where they 
can live in happiness and leave in peace the majority government 
here in Mozambique. The majority in this country does not 
discriminate against, or show hostility to, the other sections 
of society. Dr. Carlos Jeque's views on the excessive placement 
of blacks in the state apparatus and an alleged hostile behavior 
in relation to coloreds are purely and simply groundless.

  [Text] Another meeting of the General Peace Accord's 
Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] took place in the 
country's capital today. Edmundo Galiza Matos reports: 
  A very good evening, dear listeners! The peace process 
experienced new developments here in Maputo today. The General 
Peace Accord's CSC met, under the chairmanship of Aldo Ajello, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in 
Mozambique, to examine the confinement and demobilization of 
troops from the government and the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo]. The parties centered their discussions on 
delays allegedly being observed on the government side. The 
concern of the international community was conveyed by the 
respective ambassadors. Let us hear what Armando Guebuza, head 
of the government delegation to the CSC, had to say on the issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Guebuza] We, the government, agree with 
the report presented by the president of the Cease-Fire 
Commission [words indistinct] delays in confining troops. The 
government evidently [words indistinct] made a move last week, 
confining more troops [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did the international community 
express any concern regarding delays [words indistinct]? 
  [Guebuza] The international community expressed concern over 
the delays observed and expressed satisfaction that [words 
indistinct] as well as a warning of the dangers that these 
delays in the implementation of the accord can represent [words 
indistinct] can jeopardize the elections date. But, obviously 
the [words indistinct] the last date for elections. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] delays [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Guebuza] We shall work [words indistinct] to prolong a 
situation of this nature. 
  [Correspondent] No money, no elections. This is what [words 
indstinct] Dhlakama said. What do you think of that? 
  [Guebuza] I think that we have to hold elections, taking 
into 
account the reality in the country, with our limitations, with 
our economic and financial [words indistinct]. The country does 
not have sufficient money [words indistinct]. We have to work 
in this way. Nothing can replace the stability of the country, 
particularly relating to money [words indistinct] additional 
financial resources [words indistinct] and we have asked the 
international community to see whether it will carry out its 
promises to allow us to hold elections, without many 
difficulties. 
  [Correspondent] But, in your view, this statement [words 
indistinct] no money, no elections, [words indistinct] Renamo 
will not take part in elections. What does this mean for the 
government? 
  [Guebuza] It is dangerous [words indistinct]. We think that 
the important parties in this process should be moved by the 
objectives [words indistinct] respecting the freedom of men 
[words indistinct] and to advance to a situation of 
participation in economic process, without [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] Renamo in elections? 
  [Guebuza] I hope Renamo will reflect on this demand. It 
cannot be used as a blackmail [words indistinct] our people want 
money but are aware that money can [words indistinct] with the 
country's stability. [end recording] 
  In turn, Renamo's Jose de Castro says his movement is not 
happy with delays by the government in confining troops and went 
so far as to propose that the international community should 
condemn the government for this delay. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro] Renamo is not happy because the 
government has slowed, I can even say halted, the confinement of 
its troops. We do not know the reasons which make the 
government act in this way. Accordingly, we propose that there 
should be a declaration condemning this action, because in the 
past when there were no justifiable reasons to condemn Renamo 
[words indistinct] if it was Renamo to delay or halt the 
confinement of troops, the whole world would be shouting at this 
time. 
  [Correspondent] This means Renamo wants the CSC to condemn 
the government delays? 
  [Castro] Exactly, exactly, exactly. 
  [Correspondent] The recent statement by Renamo President 
Afonso Dhlakama that without money, there will be no elections 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Castro] [Words indistinct] he was very clear when he said 
that with or without conditions, we shall participate in 
elections. This means that even with the difficulties that we 
are facing, with regard to logistics and transforming our 
movement into a party, our president has already said that we 
shall take part in elections [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct]. 
  [Castro] [Words indistinct] without money, the statement has 
already been made [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] The independent MEDIAFAX publication reported today 
that in December of last year four foreign nongovernmental 
organizations [NGO's] in Mozambique protested to UN Special 
Representative Aldo Ajello that UN Operations in Mozambique 
[Unomoz] personnel were allegedly involved in child prostitution 
in this country. 
  MEDIAFAX reports that the four NGO's come from the United 
Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, and Norway. Those 
organizations believe they have good reason to believe that some 
Unomoz soldiers are sexually exploiting children. Those 
organizations also noted that if such behavior is proven, then 
it is in violation of Article 34 of the Child Rights Convention. 
  Those organizations have called on UN Special Representative 
Aldo Ajello to take measures to investigate the matter and act 
to protect the children.

  [Text] The unarmed opposition political parties have 
accused the Mozambican Government and the Mozambique National 
Resistance, Renamo, of having blatantly violated the letter and 
the spirit of Article 15 of the Electoral Law by appointing 
avowed Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, Party and Renamo 
members to the National Elections Commission. 
  Article 15 of the Electoral Law states that the National 
Elections Commission will be made up of people whose 
professional and personal attributes will guarantee a balanced 
approach, objectivity, and independence in relation to all 
political parties. 
  The Radio Mozambique news desk has received a communique 
saying that, by appointing professed Frelimo and Renamo members 
to the National Elections Commission, the two former warring 
sides have created a precedent that may result in future 
violations of the Electoral Law. That document also says that 
such behavior creates the possibility and conditions for 
disagreements that could have unforeseeable consequences because 
it will hinder consensus within the National Elections 
Commission. 
  The unarmed opposition political parties further note that 
the government and Renamo are only worried about defending their 
parties' interests, thereby ensuring that there will not be 
honesty in the upcoming electoral process. 
  The communique issued by the unarmed opposition political 
parties also says that Renamo has shown unprecedented 
opportunism and a lack of democratic spirit by grabbing the 13 
seats in the Central Electoral Administration Technical 
Secretariat which had been reserved for all opposition parties. 
According to the unarmed opposition, by resorting to such 
behavior Renamo has tried to show that it heads the opposition, 
while making it clear that its much vaunted interest in 
democracy amounts to no more than a farce. 
  The unarmed opposition has also called on the Mozambican 
Government and Renamo to reconsider their stands and to abide by 
the Electoral Law. 
  The unarmed opposition political parties met in Maputo 
yesterday to assess what they describe as the impact of 
partisanship in the National Elections Commission and to discuss 
the composition of the Elections Administration Technical 
Secretariat, STAE.

  [Text] Yesterday's mutinies by demobilized soldiers in 
Pemba, the capital of Cabo Delgado Province, are but the latest 
in a series of such mutinies in that province alone. Chiure, 
Namialo, Ancuabe, and Montepuez District have already 
experienced similar demonstrations in the latter part of last 
year. Emilio Manhique reports: 
  [Begin recording] Dialogue averted the worst in Montepuez 
last week. The provincial government was forced to [word 
indistinct] team headed by the provincial director of the 
Department for the Prevention and Control of Natural Disasters, 
DPCCN, so the demobilized soldiers could voice their grievances. 
Famine is the principal problem faced by the demobilized 
soldiers. The money they received when they demobilized is 
already gone. It is worth noting that they [word indistinct] 
pittance: A soldier receives a total of 150,000 meticals upon 
demobilization. That [words indistinct] 25,000 meticals per 
month. 
  The problem is that the majority of the demobilized troops 
know how to do nothing other than soldiering. Furthermore, they 
have become used to having the state look after them. Today 
they are faced with civilian life and they feel like castaways 
in a very turbulent sea. Obviously, they are again turning to 
the state for help because they see the state as their father. 
In fact, this was the expression I heard most from demobilized 
soldiers in Montepuez. They kept saying: The state is our 
father. 
  Pedro Seguro, the administrator for Montepuez, may never 
have 
thought he would have so many sons from a single delivery. On 
just one occasion, Seguro received 309 demobilized soldiers 
(?who had returned) from various parts of the country and who 
went to his office to ask for food. They informed him that when 
they were demobilized they were told that, in case of 
difficulties, they could approach the administrator for help. 
Those soldiers keep calling the administrator, quote, our 
father, unquote. 
  Dialogue may have prevailed initially, but then it slid down 
to threats. The demobilized soldiers went to the 
administrator's house on more than nine occasions. They placed 
the administration building under siege and prevented work from 
being done. Under pressure, the administrator ordered the DPCCN 
to open its storehouses and distribute corn, cooking, beans, and 
hoes. The nongovernmental German Agrarian Action organization 
also supported those moves. 
  Two months later, though, the demobilized soldiers came back 
for more food. When the administrator told them that the 
storehouses were empty, they demanded that he hand over the corn 
owned by Lomaco [Lonrho [London Rhodesia]-Mozambique 
Agroindustrial Company] and Agricultural Products Marketing 
Company, Agricom, among other companies. The administrator made 
it clear that he did not have the authority to do that, 
whereupon the demobilized soldiers threatened to go on mutiny if 
a provincial government team did not go to Montepuez to hear 
their complaints. This was precisely the atmosphere that we 
found in Montepuez last week, but that time, at least, dialogue 
prevailed. 
  Provincial DPCCN Director (Julai) invited the demobilized 
soldiers to visit the DPCCN's storehouses so they could see for 
themselves that there was no food. He promised that they would 
receive some as soon as there was some food. Good sense won the 
day on that occasion but we were left with the abiding 
impression that the matter had only been temporarily put off. 
  The problem of demobilized soldiers in Montepuez, as in many 
other parts of the country, is a powder keg waiting to blow up. 
Though UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello has proposed it, I 
fail to see how an increase in compensation pay, from the 
equivalent of six months to 24 months, can help solve the 
problem. It will be just another palliative measure. 
  Moreover, such mutinies only make it all the more pressing 
for the Reintegration Commission, Core, to start operating as 
soon as possible. Civilian society must also be given a say 
concerning this matter. Let the opposition political parties 
neither fold their arms nor seek gains from this situation just 
because they may think this is the Mozambique Liberation Front 
Party's problem alone. When the forecast 80,000 soldiers have 
been demobilized and they continue to face problems rejoining 
civilian life, then we see that today's mutinies are but child 
play. These desperate and forgotten men are capable of causing 
much worse trouble. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Phindile Simelane] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister, Prince Mbilini yesterday 
welcomed the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Sieou-Je Hoang 
[name and title as published] and his delegation to the Kingdom. 
The delegation will be holding their 1994 Regional ambassadors' 
meeting in the country. 
  The Prime Minister said this signifies the strong bonds of 
friendship that exists between the two countries and "the trust 
and confidence the government and the Republic of China and 
Taiwan place on us. The friendship of our two countries dates 
back when Swaziland attained her independence in 1968 and ever 
since, has grown from strength to strength." 
  He further extended regards to the Chinese Government for 
the 
contributions they made towards the preservation of the 
country's heritage through the building of King Sobhuza II 
Memorial Hall at Lobamba. "This is a greatest gift to the Swazi 
Nation, for King Sobhuza II is held in the highest esteem by the 
people of this country," he said. 
  Furthermore, the Premier thanked the Chinese government for 
the assistance rendered to the people of Swaziland and economic 
co-operation existing between the two-countries. "Your 
Agricultural Mission continues to play an important role in 
improving the farming standard of local farmers despite the 
prolonged severe drought we continue to experience," he stated. 
  The two governments last week signed an agreement amounting 
to E[Emalangeni] 3m[million] to boost agriculture. The money 
will help farmers obtain loans from the Swaziland Savings and 
Development Bank. 
  The Premier, on behalf of the nation, thanked the Chinese 
government for their generosity during the time when in dire 
need. The Chinese government contributed twice to the Disaster 
Relief Force to help starving victims of the ravaging drought 
and again when the nation was celebrating the Silver Jubilee. 
They donated financially and materially. The Premier promised 
that Swaziland would continue to support the government of the 
Republic of China in the international forum in search for peace.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African 
National Union-Patriotic Front], has begun a nationwide 
restructuring exercise in the run-up to the election of 
provincial officials and the full national party congress later 
this year. But the exercise has uncovered divisions and 
personality clashes and rivalries within the party at the local 
level. One of the worst scrabbles has been in Masvingo 
Province, where rival government ministers and their followers 
have been involved in a good two months of mudslinging, but now 
the party top brass is stepping in to heal the rift, as Rachel 
Rawlings reports from Harare: 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] The vice president, Simon 
Muzenda, 
has called for an end to what he called this nonsense about 
factions and ordered the two sides to sit down and thrash out 
their differences. The bickering is between Minister of Mines 
Eddison Zvobgo and Provincial Governor Josiah Hungwe, supported 
by Minister of Higher Education Stanislaus Mudenge. They and 
their followers have been battling for control of ZANU in 
Masvingo since October, accusing each other of being political 
(?upstarts) bent on hijacking the party. 
  Mr. Muzenda's peace effort didn't appear to get off to a 
good 
start. At yesterday's meeting governor Hungwe's supporters 
turned up in force, but only managed to [words indistinct] 
faction. There are rumors in the Mashonaland West. A false rape 
charge brought against the local party candidate could have been 
politically motivated, while Manicaland Provincial congress had 
to be postponed because some delegates claimed local party 
elections had been rigged. In the eastern town of Mutare, the 
party restructuring exercise was postponed because of apathy 
amongst eligible delegates, and there have also been problems in 
Matabeleland. 
  Despite the widespread local bickering, the party's 
hierarchy 
has until recently made little comment. It appears Mr. Muzenda 
who comes from Masvingo, had intervened in a row there to 
prevent a coordinated attack from provincial level against the 
national hierarchy. There were reports of a secret meeting 
between one of the Masvingo factions and a local politician from 
Matabeleland, where they discussed lack of development in the 
two provinces, and the formation of a common front to push the 
government to provide more resources. Mr. Muzenda criticized 
such talk as very dangerous, saying what it really means is the 
government, which you are part of, has done nothing and, 
therefore, should be removed. It appears the party doesn't mind 
local scrabbles, but when dissents threaten those at the top, 
something has to be done. [end recording]

  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, today 
held discussions with Benin's foreign minister, Mr. Sossou 
[title and name as heard], at the Castle, Osu. They discussed 
the situation in Togo and Liberia. Briefing newsmen on 
deliberations between the president and the Benin foreign 
minister, Ghana's foreign affairs minister, Dr. Obed Asamoah, 
maintained that the situation in Togo is an internal crisis. He 
said it is the view of Ghana that the Togolese Government, by 
shutting the door in the face of opposition and by brutalizing 
the Togolese people, has created a situation whereby the people 
are ready to fight against oppression. Dr. Asamoah said that 
President Rawlings feels that the Togolese authorities must 
create the right political and psychological atmosphere in the 
country. 
  On the question of Togolese refugees in Ghana, Dr. Asamoah 
said under international conventions, it would be incorrect for 
the country to send them back. The authorities will, however, 
make sure that Ghana is not used by some asylum seekers to raise 
tension between her and Togo. Dr. Asamoah said it is 
unfortunate that Togo always adopts an attitude that prevents it 
from looking into itself to solve problems, but uses Ghana as a 
smooth screen. 
  Mr. Sossou said in his capacity as chairman of ECOWAS 
[Economic Community of West African States], President Soglo, in 
collaboration with the other leaders in the West African 
subregion, would try to resolve differences between Ghana and 
Togo. What is needed, he said, is goodwill and understanding by 
the two nations. Benin's foreign minister said he visited Togo 
last Tuesday [18 January] to collect information on the dispute 
between Ghana and Togo to enable President Soglo to see how best 
the problem can be solved.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mike Bempong] </F>
  [Text] Relations between Ghana and Togo over the last 
couple of years have been anything but cordial and friendly. 
They have been characterized by border clashes, border 
incursions, mutual suspicions, Togolese accusations of 
subversion, Ghanaian denials of such accusations, refugee 
problems, maltreatment of Ghanaians in Togo, and so on and so 
forth. These issues have dominated and poisoned the 
relationship between the two neighboring countries to the extent 
that people on either side of the border have begun to see them 
as normal. But for two countries which share such deep 
historical, ethnic, and economic ties there is hardly anything 
normal about this state of affairs. 
  It is indeed shameful that the great potential that exists 
for subregional cooperation and collaboration for the mutual 
benefit of the peoples of the two countries is being allowed to 
go to waste. To be fair, however, it must be said that the Ghana 
Government over the years has taken one initiative after the 
other with the view to achieving the reversal of the present 
status quo. These initiatives, including the setting up of a 
Joint Ghana-Togo Border Demarcation Commission [and] the 
conclusion of the quadripartite agreements, have not been 
appreciated by the Togolese authorities. Rather, they eventually 
subverted them in one way or the other. Year after year, the 
Togolese authorities continue to blame Ghana for all their 
internal problems and woes. The latest in the seemingly 
unending string of Togolese accusations against Ghana were 
actually accompanied by unacceptable levels of aggression 
against Ghanaians and Ghanaian property. It may never be known 
how many innocent Ghanaian lives were lost through this 
unprovoked aggression by the Togolese security agencies. But, 
certainly, no responsible government can continue to look on 
unconcerned as its national and property are subjected to 
unprovoked aggression. 
  It is in this light that last Friday's [21 January] news 
conference has been welcomed by Ghanaians even though some 
consider that the time for action is long overdue. The Togolese 
authorities need to take the foreign minister's advice seriously 
that any new unprovoked aggression will be met with commensurate 
response. Ghanaians, it appears, are being taken for granted by 
our neighbors simply because we are peaceful and peace-loving 
and we want to concentrate our time and energies on the 
development of our motherland. This should not however be 
misconstrued to mean we lack the capacity for self-defense or 
our government is incapable of protecting its nationals and 
their property. Let the Togolese authorities be advised to 
settle down to constructively resolving their own internal 
conflicts through democratic means rather than looking for 
enemies where none exist.

of the Ghana Embassy and Ghana Airways in Conakry this morning 
to protest the cancellation of their repatriation by the 
Ghanaian ambassador. Two Ghana Airways employees were slightly 
injured by the demonstrators who damaged the airline's computer 
before dispersing. According to a Ghana Embassy official, the 
repatriation by boat of Ghanaians living in Guinea, which was 
scheduled for yesterday, had to be canceled at the last minute 
by the ambassador because the government had not given its 
approval.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has called 
on industrialists to assist the government in its economic 
recovery program through promotion of the productive sector, 
especially the non-oil sector. Gen. Abacha made the call in a 
message to the end of the Seventh Joint Domestic Trade Fair in 
Maiduguri. Patrick Owezor has the details. 
  [Begin recording] In the message read by the state military 
administrator, Group Captain Ibrahim Dada, Gen. Abacha called on 
Nigerians to look inwards in view of the deep economic recession 
in the country. He said the present administration was keen in 
restoring the economy back on a sound footing within the 
shortest possible time. The head of state said the attempt to 
reactivate the economy could be seen in the steps already taken 
by the federal government to keep the value of the naira at 22 
naira to the dollar, the prohibition of the activities of the 
parallel market, and the review of other monetary regulations. 
He assured Nigerians that effective implementation of this 
year's budget would be pursued to the letter. The head of state 
then called on all and sundry to give their full cooperation, 
solidarity, and unflinching support to the federal government 
and its policies and programs. He hoped that the entrepreneurs 
seize the opportunity of the fair to make contact and business 
connections that would enable them to acquire capital, markets, 
and technology for the enhancement of their business. Gen. 
Abacha commended the governments of Bauchi, Borno, Adamawa, 
Taraba, and Yobe states for harnessing their resources to 
organize the fair. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 24 Jan (AFP) -- Nigerian presidential 
candidate Moshood Abiola, generally believed to have won [the] 
elections last June before the results were annulled, has 
predicted a rapid end to General Sani Abacha's military regime. 
Abacha's government will soon meet the same ends as those of 
General Ibrahim Babangida and Ernest Shonekan, his predecessors, 
Abiola was reported as saying by the independent Lagos daily 
GUARDIAN on Monday. 
  Abacha came to power in November last year following the 
collapse of Babangida's eight-year regime in August and the 
short-lived government of Shonekan, an unelected civilian former 
premier. 
  "Any nation that does not have the chance of choosing those 
who lead them is a slave nation," Abiola added. Abiola, a 
millionaire Muslim who headed the Social Democratic Party's 
presidential bid for power, explained why he had not led an open 
rebellion against the cancelling of the presidential election 
result. "I am not mad enough to fight with the sword. To be 
president you have to be alive. I want to stay alive to govern 
Nigeria and solve its mounting problems," Abiola said. 
  Abiola branded Abacha's regime "anti-democratic and 
illegitimate" when he returned to Nigeria at the end of December 
after leaving for a "rest" in Britain.

  [Text] All companies in the country are now expected to 
start paying the compulsory 2 percent tax towards educational 
development. Education Minister, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, announced 
this in Gboko, Benue State, at a reception organized in his 
honor by the Yamgba Development Association. NTA Makurdi 
correspondent, John Gbateman has the report: 
  [Gbateman] Education Minister Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, who 
announced 
other plans to sanitize the education sector, said books will be 
supplied freely to primary schools in the country. He said the 
arrangements had been concluded to pay all outstanding salaries 
arrears of primary school teachers. Dr. Ayu explained however, 
that local governments that will seek federal allocations but 
fail to pay teachers' salary will have their allocations 
deducted at source. The education minister further warned that 
any officer who diverts money meant for educational development, 
will henceforth be dismissed from service with immediate effect. 
These measures he said, are aimed at saving education from 
collapse and at restoring sanity in the sector. Dr. Ayu 
reaffirmed his ministry's determination to make education for 
all by the year 2000, a reality. 
  The chairman of education, Chief (Denen Topi), urged the 
minister to use his position to reshape education in the 
country. He also appealed to the minister to look into the 
issue of brain drain to save the future of Nigerian children. 
Dr. Ayu and the minister of state for education, Alhaji Wada 
Nas, who accompanied him on the trip, was presented with 
souvenirs.

  [Text] Freetown, 25 Jan (AFP) -- Rebel forces have killed 
about 100 civilians and razed several villages to the ground in 
attacks on the Bo region since the beginning of the month, 
military sources said here Monday. Villagers have fled the 
region in Sierra Leone in panic after rebels from the 
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) attacked eight towns in the 
past three weeks. 
  Eyewitnesses told AFP here that some of the rebels boys aged 
10 to 17 but were heavily armed and had no hesitation in 
torturing victims. Government forces a year ago re-captured the 
eight villages, located 170 kilometres (105 miles) east of the 
capital Freetown, and have maintained overall their control in 
the area despite the recent attacks, the military sources 
reported.

  [Text] Calm returned to Abeche, the capital of the Ouaddai 
Region, today. The inhabitants of Abeche woke up yesterday to 
sustained weapons fire. Some elements of the Chadian National 
Front [FNT] attacked the military garrison and the Gendarmerie. 
This attack left 29 dead among the attackers and two among the 
government forces. Defense Minister Mamadou Regui immediately 
went to the site. For the moment, the situation is under 
control, and the people have resumed their normal activities, as 
the minister of defense explained in a statement this afternoon 
in Abeche. Here, Minister Mamadou Regui speaks to our special 
correspondent Solomon Ngartha. 
  [Begin Regui recording] Soon after our arrival, (?we noticed 
that) the situation was quite alarming. We saw some fighting. 
We saw dead bodies almost everywhere in the town, and we still 
heard shooting here and there. 
  After the agreement, the elements of the FNT gathered here 
in 
Abeche. They numbered about 400. They were waiting to be 
absorbed into the army, but unfortunately there were some 
constraints here and there [words indistinct] that they were 
deceived by some individuals--by people who have left the other 
fronts to come to Abeche and some accomplices in the town of 
Abeche. These elements mutinied and broke into the storerooms 
here and looted more than 400 weapons, took ammunition, and 
began the attack. After some hours of intensive fighting, the 
Chadian National Army got control of the situation. When we 
arrived here, the town was already under the full control of our 
elements. The survivors managed to flee in many directions. 
Searches are currently going on. Our troops are all over the 
place. We have organized searches in the town of Abeche, 
but--as you know--the town is very big. It is the Gendarmerie 
that is carrying out this search. These elements, it is said, 
infiltrate [words indistinct] by midnight, we saw some elements 
who were stealing and who broke into people's homes here and 
there to steal. 
  Since this morning, the situation has been calm. The town 
has begun to come back to life. Shops have opened. It is true 
that it not all the shops, but there are traders who have 
already opened the doors of their shops and have begun working. 
The town is quite lively. I have met with some traders. I 
have met with traditional chiefs and village chiefs and unit 
heads. We discussed many issues and I told them that their 
security is guaranteed. I personally engaged myself to search 
for these [words indistinct] in the Army and in the Gendarmerie. 
We have seen some elements who are currently under (?detention) 
and who will be brought before court. 
  Concerning the FNT elements who are in flight, I mean those 
in flight who are hiding somewhere in the town or are very far 
away in the bush, I still extend to them a hand of 
reconciliation. They must surrender. Their security will be 
guaranteed because the agreement is still valid provided they 
return. I think that they have heard the appeal by their 
leader, the chief of staff, (Dawuud), who was with us today. He 
launched an appeal. He has asked them to return. Well, if they 
return, their lives are guaranteed and we will take all the 
measures necessary to have them brought into the Army, have them 
organized, and [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Gunfire from street fighting in a suburb of the 
Congolese capital Brazzaville, has hit the American ambassador's 
residence prompting him to take refuge in the city center. 
Heavy arms fire echoed across the southern suburbs of 
Makelekele and Bacongo throughout the day yesterday. The 
American ambassador lives near Bacongo which, like Makelekele, 
is a stronghold of opponents of President Pascal Lissouba. An 
American diplomat said about 50 bullets hit the ambassador's 
residence during fighting between police commandos and 
opposition militias. The area has been sealed off by security 
forces loyal to Mr. Lissouba for about a week since the 
disappearance of a member of the presidential bodyguard.

  [Text] Sao Tome, 24 Jan (AFP)--The Supreme Court in Sao 
Tome and Principe last weekend legalized two new political 
parties, the Independent Democratic Action (ADI) and the 
People's Alliance (AP), official sources announced today in Sao 
Tome. The ADI, headed by Gabriel Costa, who is currently 
President Miguel Trovoada's adviser for legal and political 
affairs, had earlier participated in the 1992 municipal 
elections as an "independent group" and won in the Cantagalo 
district, south of the Sao Tome island. Cantagalo is an "area 
of influence" of the head of state. 
  Mr. Costa's participation was challenged at the Supreme 
Court 
by the ruling the party, the Party of Democratic Convergence 
(PCD-GR) whose arguments were rejected by the Supreme Court. 
  The People's Alliance was formed in Lisbon and its 
supporters 
are mainly Sao Tome immigrants in Portugal, as well as children 
of Portuguese nationals of Sao Tomean origin who left the 
archipelago at its independence in 1975. The AP is headed by 
Carlos Espirito Santo, who is currently living in Portugal. 
  Multiparty politics was introduced in 1990. So far, the 
country has four political parties, three of which are presented 
in parliament.

<F P=106> [Program hosted by reporter Imana] </F>
  [Text] The negotiators from the High Council of the 
Republic [HCR] and the Parliament met once again at the Palace 
of the People today. Contrary to yesterday's session, only one 
item was on the agenda for today's meeting: namely, the 
formation of the definitive executive committee of the 
legislative body for transition period. Our reporter, Kabamba 
Kasongo, who was at the Palais du Peuple, is in the studio with 
details on the session: 
  [Kasongo] It is worth correcting that this evening's session 
had three items on the agenda, not just one item. These three 
items are the formation of the executive committee, as you said, 
the presentation of the final report on the political 
consultations, and also the presentation of the information 
gathered from those who participated in the formation of the 
various commissions. Those are the three items on the agenda 
for the session at the Palace of the People. The session began 
at 1715 [1615 GMT] instead of 1500, as previously announced. As 
you know, people always report for meetings late, and one must 
wait until a quorum is reached before opening the deliberations. 
The deliberations are still going on and might continue beyond 
2200. 
  The two officials who led the two delegations to the 
political consultations read out the names of the candidates 
proposed by the two political groups for membership to the 
executive committee. The first head of delegation was Nguz A 
Karl-I-Bond, who took the floor to read out the names of the 
four candidates selected by the Political Forces of the Conclave 
[FPC]. The reading of the names was done in accordance with 
Article 10 of the draft agreement, which says--and I quote--the 
Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies [USORAL] and 
the FPC will have the same number of members in the executive 
committee of the HCR, transitional parliament, unquote. This 
was confirmed yesterday by Monsignor Monsengwo, who said that 
each side will propose four candidates. 
  The four candidates announced by Nguz A Karl-I-Bond are as 
follows: (Ange Luni Bembe), former speaker of the National 
Assembly, for the post of first deputy chairman--the chairman of 
the HCR, transitional parliament, is still Monsignor Monsengwo 
in accordance with the consensus reached by the two political 
sides--Kabimbi Ngoje for the post of second deputy chairman; 
Professor Nguyi Nduba for the post of first secretary and 
rapporteur; Vangu Mambwene for the post of second secretary and 
rapporteur. This list was welcomed by applause from the entire 
palace without any protest. But the USORAL's list, which was 
presented by Chairman Gizenga, who led the FPC delegations to 
the negotiations, generated lengthy debates that are still going 
on in the hall. 
  [Imana] What were the reasons for the debates? 
  [Kasongo] Before answering your question, I will first give 
the names. Mr. Gizenga, on behalf of the USORAL, read out four 
names: Mr. Joseph Ileo for the post of first deputy chairman, 
Christophe Lutumbula for the post of second deputy chairman, 
Lawyer Chinkinla for the post of first secretary and rapporteur, 
and Valentin Mubaka for that of second secretary and rapporteur. 
Actually, the USORAL simply presented its former executive 
committee, and this is why there was a protest by the Allies, 
who are now gathered within what is known as Rally of the Forces 
for Democratic Change. 
  It was Fredy Mulongo who took the floor to strongly protest 
the composition of the executive committee proposed by the 
USORAL. Mr. Mulungo's protest was caused by the fact that the 
Allies were not contacted when this list was being drawn up. 
Many people also took the floor to intervene and challenge the 
list proposed by the USORAL, and this is why the deliberations 
are still going on right now.

  [Text] Professor Asrat Woldeyes has told an All-Amhara 
People's Organization [AAPO] meeting in Addis Ababa that there 
is no need of a government for a people who can administer 
themselves in the absence of the rule of law and police. 
Supporters of AAPO, who met yesterday to celebrate the second 
anniversary of the organization, also were heard to say that a 
nationality group capable of using its own language is a black 
frenge [Amharic for "white man"], the inference of which means a 
black as civilized as a white man. 
  Observers said that the supporters of AAPO's anniversary 
meeting, presided over by its chairman Prof. Asrat, were at 
first preoccupied with singing the songs of war. Prof. Asrat 
said the day was the holiest of holidays and he wanted it to be 
celebrated that way every year, adding that his organization 
should wait for the outcome of the struggle beginning the day 
after the transitional government continues to rule by means of 
guns [as heard]. One of the points read out at the meeting 
says: We should hold our flag high once these racists who 
reduced our 3,000-year-old history to 100 years are annihilated.

  [Text] The government has intensified operations against 
illegal arms dealers along the Kenya-Sudan border, the Turkana 
District Commissioner (Simon Mutogwa), has said. He said there 
would be no compromise on matters of Kenyan security and asked 
wananchi [citizens] to report suspected leaders to the police. 
He was reacting to allegations by the Turkana North MP, Mr. 
Japheth Ekidor, who alleged that people from outside the 
district were in Lokichoggio with the intention of buying arms 
from the Sudanese.

<F P=106> [Report by Lilian Nduta] </F>
  [Text] Kenya requires to import 1.4 million tonnes of 
cereals this year to avert a looming famine, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) says. The UN agency says in a 
special report on food supply situation and crop prospects in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, that the food scarcity in the country is due 
to disastrous crop harvest last year. The report says the poor 
harvest was realized through a combination of erratic rains in 
high potential areas, reduced fertilizer application and 
localized ethnic disturbances. 
  It adds that the food crisis has been worsened by the 
presence of a large number of refugees and serious drought in 
the pastoral areas. 
  The report is the first issue of a series prepared by the 
FAO 
global information and early warning system on food supply 
situation, cereal import and food aid requirements for 
developing countries. 
  The report lists Kenya among 15 poor countries which face 
exceptional food emergencies in Africa. It estimates that Kenya 
will need 724,000 tonnes food aid of which 100,000 tonnes is 
emergency food aid for drought-affected and displaced people. 
  However, the report gives favorable prospects for the 
1993/94 
short rains crop whose harvest commences next month in most 
parts of the country. FAO says short rains were received in the 
major growing areas in late November and early December. 
  The report adds that there was a likelihood of good harvest 
this year through large stocks of fertilizer and farm inputs 
carried forward from previous season. The report says the 
current estimate of 2.2 million tonnes was far below the average 
for the last five years. It says the situation has been eased 
by the cross-border trade which has enabled large quantities of 
maize to cross into Kenya from Uganda. 
  Total commercial imports, including cross-border trade and 
purchases on the international market are forecast at a maximum 
of 713,000 tonnes. 
  The report says other cereals such as rice and wheat are 
expected to be imported through the private sector but added 
that there was still little incentive for maize importation. 
  The FAO report further adds that the government's ability to 
import commercially has been constrained by financial problems.

  [Text] Mogadishu, Jan 24 (AFP)--General Mohamed Hersi 
Morgan, former defence minister and son-in-law of deposed 
president Mohamed Siad Barre, has returned to his Kismaayo 
stronghold, a United Nations spokesman said Monday [24 January]. 
  General Morgan was welcomed back to the port town Sunday by 
around 1,000 supporters following a decision by UN forces 
operating in Somalia to lift an order banning him from the area. 
  Morgan accompanied his return to one of Somalia's most 
sensitive towns with an appeal for his supporters to "work 
together for peace," UN forces spokesman Chris Budge said. 
  Many observers see the southern port as a likely flash point 
if the civil war between forces loyal to self-proclaimed interim 
president Ali Mahdi Mohamed and rival warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid re-erupts. The run down of UN forces and withdrawal of 
United States forces is seen as raising the chances of new 
clashes. The slimming down of the UN contingent is set to 
gather pace in February with the current force of 23,318 falling 
to around 16,000 by the end of March, Budge said. At its 
height, the UN force stood at 30,000. 
  US, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian and Turkish 
contingents are scheduled to leave Somalia by April with their 
replacements due in the next few weeks. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali complained at the 
end of January that governments had ignored his request for 
extra troops for Somalia. 
  With a force of 16,000 the UN would have to forego moves to 
disarm Somalia's fighting factions and limit itself to 
protecting ports, airports and relief supplies, Butrus-Ghali 
said. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative in 
Somalia, U.S. Admiral Jonathan Howe, met Monday with General 
Mohamed Abshir Musa in Bossasso in northeast Somalia. Musa, 
whose party dominates the region, is tipped as a possible 
intermediary between Aidid and Ali Mahdi because of his contacts 
with both camps. Musa could be asked to kick-start stalled 
peace negotiations in Nairobi, sources close to UN forces said. 
  Morgan's banishment followed a bloody struggle for Kismaayo 
with his warlord rival Colonel Omar Jays. Jays, closely allied 
to Aidid within the Somali National Alliance, has also been 
freed to return to Kismaayo but his whereabouts are unknown. 
"Apparently he is still in Somalia," Budge said.

<F P=106> [Report by Yusuf Khazim: "Somaliland Sets Up Its Army; </F>
Referendum on Independence To Be Held in July"] 
  [Excerpts] London--The "Republic of Somaliland" has decided 
to hold a referendum in July on its independence from Somalia. 
It has also announced the establishment of the first vanguards 
of its national army, 6,000-strong, and the nucleus of a 
national police force. 
  In this context, a "Republic of Somaliland" delegation 
begins 
a series of meetings in London today, Monday. [passage omitted] 
  Interior Minister Musa Bihi Abdi [name as transliterated] 
told AL-HAYAH yesterday that Somaliland's independence has 
become a reality, "and we will explain to British officials the 
latest developments in our country. We will also seek their 
recognition of our independent state, as well as development and 
economic aid. Our people have decided on independence through 
conferences held by tribal chiefs and leaders in Somaliland, 
which enjoys security and stability. We currently have a 
government, the second since the announcement of the republic, a 
legislative council (parliament), and senate. And we have 
recently announced a national charter, which sets a date for a 
referendum on independence in July. And the parliament has 
recently approved the committee assigned to draw up a draft 
constitution for the country." [passage omitted] 
  Bihi admitted that "undisciplined armed elements" still 
control the airport of Hargeysa, capital of Somaliland. 
However, he played down the effect of this on the central 
authority's role. He said: "We were faced with the same problem 
last year with undisciplined elements which were in control of 
Berbera port, which is now under our control. We are currently 
working to regain the airport peacefully. We are aware that the 
groups controlling the airport are running this vital facility 
well, and we are in contact with them." 
  The Somaliland interior minister criticized the United 
Nations and its second operation in Somalia, UNOSOM-2. He said: 
"It is obstructing our efforts to consolidate our independence. 
This is why we have rejected and continue to reject the UN 
attempts to dispatch forces to our country and to impose its 
rules on us." He said that his country's government has invited 
several states and regional and international organizations to 
supervise and observe the impartiality of the referendum. He 
stressed that "the referendum will be conducted on the date set, 
even if the United Nations refuses to supervise it."

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program hosted by Josephine </F>
Hazely] 
  [Text] The self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland scored 
what it considered a very little victory this week in its battle 
for international recognition when neighboring Djibouti became 
the first country to acknowledge Somaliland as a state in its 
own right. Somaliland has unsuccessfully been calling for 
international recognition ever since it broke away from Somalia 
two years ago. Somaliland's minister of water and mineral 
resources, Mr. Mohamed Ali Ateye, is passing through London at 
the moment. In our studio, I asked him what difference, if any, 
recognition by Djibouti would make: 
  [Begin recording] [Ateye] Well, if you are talking in terms 
of financial aid, it won't make much in terms of rehabilitation 
or reconstruction that we need desperately, but some companies 
will be willing to...[pauses] who are interested in the, maybe, 
the oil prospection in our country were insisting that they will 
wait for some legal understanding, recognition from some 
countries. And we hope this is the beginning of having the 
world community to focus their attention on why Djibouti has 
opted for this and then follow the logical reason behind it. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Hazely] Tell me, how difficult has it been for a country 
like Somaliland to pull through to get investment etc., etc., as 
a result of you not being recognized by the world community? 
  [Ateye] Well, indeed, yes, it has been very difficult for us 
to do anything apart from.... [pauses] Because the whole 
infrastructure collapsed, all the institutions have been 
disastrously either demolished or robbed and whatever little 
that we do operate on now is purely on the entrepreneurship and 
the efforts of the local businessmen who are facing very acute 
difficulties in trying to export the livestock which is the 
major earner for dollars and, you know, for...[pauses] revenue 
for the country. And we are suffering. I mean all the aid that 
we receive is mostly through NGO's [nongovernmental 
organizations], which are operating on humanitarian basis and 
all of them would like to operate on an emergency basis. Nobody 
is looking into the long-term [word indistinct] or developmental 
inputs, and this could only come through [word indistinct] camps 
and bilateral.... 
  [Hazely, interrupting] Why should people recognize you, 
anyway? I mean, what have you in Somaliland to offer the 
international community, politically or economically? 
  [Ateye] Well, the reason is.... [pauses] Well, I do agree 
with you if you say what do we have for the world. I mean, we 
are taking care of ourselves. We are trying to develop 
democratically, and we are asking the world community to see us 
here in terms of...[pauses] to be allowed to determine our own 
future. I don't know how to say it. I mean, what will we offer 
the world in terms of recognition and that is.... 
  [Hazely, interrupting] Well, the world is....[pauses] You 
interdepend on each other. I mean you either have to have some 
political support or some economic support or some mineral 
support or natural resources, otherwise they are not going to 
take you--your call for recognition--seriously, are they? 
  [Ateye] Well, I am trying to say today....[pauses] I mean, 
our position is a bit tight, and let us expect that most 
certainly it will not be always like this because our country--I 
mean, there could be resources. We have the fisheries. We have 
reasonable....[pauses] I mean, the studies that have been taking 
place in our country so far before the civil war started, there 
was this reasonable assumption that there is hydrocarbon and 
petroleum deposits over there, and there are also some mineral 
deposits [sentence as heard]. And we could be, I mean, of 
course, contributing to the world and partly playing our part 
if, you know, when we take off. But at the moment, you know, we 
need a bit of development and standing up. 
  [Hazely] Now, you are here in Britain, and, hopefully, you 
say you will be seeing the Overseas Development Ministry 
officials and some officials of the Foreign Affairs Ministry 
here in London. What would be your message to them? 
  [Ateye] We are submitting our proposals for helping us to 
build the institutions of security and peace, to strengthen 
them. I mean, we have resolved it politically, and we have made 
institutions to look after this and fulfill the requirements. 
But what we need is institutional support, and this is what we 
are expecting and asking governments like this government to 
help us build and strengthen these democratic institutions like 
the [words indistinct] police force or demobilization of the 
Army militia or the judicial system and things like this. I 
mean, these are the major aspects we will be looking after.

  [Excerpt] Bilateral talks between Uganda and Eritrea have 
opened in Kampala as President Isayas Afewerki of Eritrea began 
a four-day state visit to Uganda. 
  In his brief remarks during the opening of the talks, 
President Museveni said, in order to promote trade between 
Uganda and Eritrea, it will be highly beneficial to rely on 
businessmen in the two countries. He added that businessmen 
are crucial in promoting trade because they have to control 
themselves in their daily transactions and are also disciplined 
by fear of bankruptcy. Mr. Museveni noted that there is a 
complementarity [as heard] between the two countries and it is 
important for businessmen to study and carry out a survey, 
especially on items that can be offered by each country for the 
sake of profitable interaction. He said that Eritrea can also 
offer salt and other products to Uganda while Uganda can give 
grain and other food products to Eritrea. President Museveni 
noted that air links are crucial for businessmen to carry out 
trade. He said that businessmen need to be facilitated with 
fast and reliable means of travel so that they are able to carry 
out transactions profitably. He added that it is important for 
Eritreans and Ugandans to interact so as to dispel the problem 
of ignorance and lack of information that hinders easy 
exploitation of available opportunities. 
  On his part, President Afewerki said that there is need to 
harness economic cooperation at regional and subregional levels 
in the context of the higher competitive global markets. He 
expressed gratitude to the people of Uganda for their 
hospitality shown to him. He commended the leadership of the 
National Resistance Movement, which he said has given him 
enlightenment on how to approach and stimulate the economy to 
ensure growth and development as well as an approach to 
bilateral cooperation. He noted that the relationship between 
the two countries is essential and could be implemented in the 
subregion which has many opportunities to offer. [passage

  [Text] The Uganda National Democratic Alliance [UNDA] and 
the Uganda Federal Army [UFA], which have been fighting a 
guerrilla war against the ruling NRM [National Resistance 
Movement] government, have resolved to suspend their armed 
struggle and join fellow Ugandans in trying to influence the 
history of the nation through nonviolent means. In a telefax 
message signed in London today, the chairman and commander in 
chief of the organization, Mr. Sam Luwero, said the leadership 
of the alliance had also decided to dissolve the organization, 
close its offices in London and cease the publication of "Focus 
on Uganda" which has been the mouth-piece of the UNDA/UFA. The 
leadership of the UNDA/UFA had further decided to accept the 
Uganda Government's assurance that all former members of the 
UNDA/UFA shall not be prosecuted and are free to return and join 
other Ugandans to help the government in its task of democratic 
process presently going on in the country. 
  In addition, the UNDA/UFA pledged their total solidarity 
with 
the Uganda Government in all its endeavors to establish a 
pragmatic process of true democracy in Uganda. The statement 
said the decision was in recognition of the fact that the NRM 
government has gone some way in trying to implement most of the 
elements encompassed in the UNDA manifesto of November 1991. 
The decision was also prompted by the fact that the people of 
Uganda are currently involved in an ongoing constitution-making 
process. 
  The statement stressed that it is imperative that all 
peace-loving citizens in our country give (?this venture) a 
chance. The statement added that continued military action is 
no longer a viable option for the UNDA/UFA struggle. 
  We must, the statement said, avoid turning our country into 
another Somalia, Liberia, or Bosnia. That is why the leadership 
of the UNDA/UFA said we (?heed) this directive. They instructed 
all members of the UNDA and officers and men of UFA to 
immediately observe an unconditional cessation of all 
hostilities against the NRM government.

  [Text] Relatives of staff in the U.S. Embassy in the Congo 
have begun to leave the country today, four days after the 
ambassador's residence came under fire from government troops. 
In the southern suburbs of the Congolese capital, the security 
situation in strongholds of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas 
has been on the slide in recent days even though the Army has 
moved in to try to seal them off, and the American decision has 
been taken after consultations with the State Department. From 
Brazzaville, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report: 
  Around 25 dependents of embassy staff are to be evacuated to 
the United States. Yesterday, the ambassador left his residence 
and moved in with one of his staff for the time being. The 
trouble took place on Friday [21 January] evening when, during a 
period of four hours, soldiers took up positions on the terrace 
of a villa next door to the ambassador's residence. Their fire 
was directed at the opposition stronghold of Bacongo, but 
several shots went wide and there are signs of some 50 bullets 
having hit the walls of the ambassador's residence, damaged 
windows, and broken the windscreen of the ambassador's car. 
  It is now a week since the suburbs of Bacongo and 
Makelekele, 
which are under the control of opposition militias, were 
blockaded by government-supporting security forces. Although 
the interior minister has given assurances that the barricades 
are nothing more than routine checkpoints, the people of these 
areas do not dare walk around nor attempt to leave the areas. 
Buses and taxis are not serving the two suburbs. The Congolese 
Red Cross says that thanks to the blockade, it has not been able 
to carry out humanitarian work in Bacongo and Makelekele. But a 
member of the opposition in Bacongo told journalists by phone 
that people in the area were receiving food supplies thanks to 
transporters bringing supplies from villages in the surrounding 
region, which is the home area of opposition leader Bernard 
Kolelas. 
  With both Bacongo and Makelekele being on the edge of 
Brazzaville, the security forces have been able to seal the 
suburbs off completely. But the resupply of the two suburbs is 
also guaranteed by traders on the River Congo between 
Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Meanwhile, violence continues to 
afflict other parts of Brazzaville, with acts of pillage and 
theft taking place every day. A group of people last night broke 
into the house of a West African trader and snatched 5 million 
CFA francs, as well as other goods.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Congolese 
opposition today accused the ruling power of organizing 
"military operations to establish a state of siege in order not 
to recognize the verdict of the arbitration committee" 
established to settle the electoral dispute before 5 February. 
  The arbitration committee is composed of seven international 
magistrates in charge of examining 58 appeals for the 
cancellation of the early 1993 legislative elections. These 
legislative elections, whose results after the first round were 
violently contested by the opposition in June and which led to a 
suspension of the vote, constitute one of the root causes of the 
political crisis that led to clashes between opposition 
militiamen and the presidential group in the southern suburbs of 
Brazzaville. After signing an agreement in Libreville last 
August which established the arbitration committee among other 
things, the elections resumed in October. 
  In a communique, the opposition accused the presidential 
group of organizing "warlike pressure and violence against 
civilians in the southern suburbs," where "armored cars fired 65 
shells on Sunday night," the statement said with no further 
details. For the opposition, these shellings are aimed at 
"destroying the bridge over River Djoue," which links the 
Brazzaville to the south of the country, and at preventing the 
southern suburbs from obtaining their provisions from the 
neighboring Pool Region. If this bridge is destroyed, "the 
opposition reserves the right to retaliate," the statement said, 
threatening to "attack local radio and television" and to block 
all "air traffic."

  [Excerpts] The minister of external relations, Professor 
Mpinga Kassenda, today received the Congolese charge d'affaires 
in Zaire in order to brief him on the strong protest launched by 
Zaire against the activities of some Brazzaville gunmen who aim 
bullets and shells at Zaire. [passage omitted] 
  Prof. Mpinga Kassenda granted an audience to (George 
Kitokoma 
Futa), acting charge d'affaires of the Republic of Congo in 
Kinshasa. The meeting took place at 1300 [1200 GMT]. Its 
purpose was to register the Zairian Government's strong protest 
against the misunderstanding currently prevailing between 
Kinshasa and Brazzaville. 
  In a press release, the Ministry of External Relations 
informed both the public and international community that during 
the night of 23 January, shells fired from Brazzaville, the 
capital of the Republic of Congo, fell on various spots in the 
city of Kinshasa, especially at Camp Tshatshi. These missiles 
caused very serious material damage. The projectiles injured 
five persons, two of them seriously, because they landed on two 
homes. The Congolese diplomat was asked to inform his government 
about this incident and ask it to immediately take appropriate 
measures to ensure that these acts, which run the risk of 
compromising relations between the two countries, are not 
repeated.

  [Excerpt] Kinshasa, 26 Jan (AFP)--Zaire's new parliament, 
formed from two rival bodies, has appointed its leaders while 
aiming for agreement on the choice of a prime minister, 
authoritative sources said here Wednesday [26 January]. The 
president of the new parliament will be the archbishop of 
Kisingani, Laurent Monsengwo, who had chaired the High Council 
of the Republic (HCR) set up in 1992 by a national conference. 
His first deputy president will be the former head of the rival 
National Assembly, consisting mainly of supporters of President 
Mobutu Sese Seko, Anzulini Bembe, the sources said. 
  The appointments were made in a parliamentary session late 
Tuesday, but the radical opposition had not named their 
candidate for premier of the central African country, prolonging 
a deadlock that has led to more than two years of political 
turmoil and economic chaos. The radical opposition coalition 
Holy Alliance has stated it wants the deputy chairman of the 
former HCR, Joseph Ileo, to be its candidate, but its 
self-styled allies want other candidates and said they have not 
been consulted by the Holy Alliance. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Colette Braeckman: "Zaire: One Year of </F>
Maneuvering for a Parliament"] 
  [Text] The new Zairian Parliament, known as the High 
Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament, met in 
Kinshasa. It was presided over by Monsignor Monsengwo, 
president of the former High Council of the Republic [HCR], who 
declared his pleasure at the "happy result" obtained by 
negotiators. The agreements concluded between the presidential 
sphere and the so-called "radical" opposition provide in 
particular for the unification of the two legislative 
assemblies, the adoption of a Single Act aimed at managing the 
transition, and a schedule for the forthcoming elections. The 
new Parliament will also have to appoint a prime minister. 
  The appearance of this elephantine structure (780 members) 
in 
reality represents the end of a year of subtle maneuvering, 
intimidation, and obstructions aimed at dismantling what was 
established by the Sovereign National Conference [CNS], 
weakening the legitimacy of Tshisekedi and isolating him within 
the opposition, and, eventually, restoring the authority of the 
head of state. With the passing of time, the operation would 
appear to have been organized with a master's touch: Initially, 
Mr. Tshisekedi was prevented from governing and was then 
dismissed after he tried to take control of the Bank of Zaire. 
Later, exactly a year ago, pillaging devastated Kinshasa and 
gave the authorities the opportunity to impose a merciless 
regime of repression. A few weeks later, members of the HCR 
were literally sequestered by the military. 
  It was then, against a background of mutiny, ethic 
confrontation in the Shaba and Kivu regions, intimidation, and 
misery that the political phase was activated: the "political 
forces of the conclave," with the blessing of Monsignor 
Monsengwo, formed a united front and issued counter-proposals to 
the conclusions of the CNS. The doubling of the institutions 
culminated with the appointment of another prime minister, 
Faustin Birindua, who was installed by a veritable show of 
strength, while Tshisekedi proved less than brilliant in his 
maneuvering ability. 
  It thus became necessary to negotiate and harmonize the 
declarations of both sides, as if the CNS, 30 percent of whose 
members were supporters of President Mobutu, had only been a 
partisan faction and not an assembly representing all sides. 
  The composition of the new Parliament affirmed this 
watering-down of the CNS into a much larger group encompassing 
the members of the former Parliament and the 160 negotiators who 
accepted the agreements, marginalizing the hardliners of 
Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS] 
party. 
  This represents a fine victory for President Mobutu who had 
always refused to get involved in CNS affairs. This time, with 
a new majority in place, he will doubtless agree to recognize 
the new Parliament: All the more easily since, unless there is 
an upset, he has assured himself of its control.

  [Summary] The Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement [EPDM] 
third congress has decided that EPDM, which was struggling under 
the objective of national unity, will continue to struggle under 
the name of ANDM, or Amhara National's Democratic Movement 
[bihere amara demokrasiyawi nikinake] for the interest of the 
Amhara people while upholding its basic democratic principles. 
The congress decided this after assessing the organization's 
yearly development and realizing that it should now shoulder its 
national responsibility, after approving the code of conduct as 
stipulated in the organization's program.

  [Text] Nairobi, 25 Jan (AFP) -- Somali factional leader 
Mohamed Farah Aidid was joined in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 
Tuesday [25 January] by three of his top aides, freed from 
detention by the United Nations last week, officials said. 
General Aidid's chief financier Osman Hassan Ali `Ato' arrived 
in Nairobi aboard a charter plane from Mogadishu with his former 
co-detainees Mohamed Hassan Awale, the warlord's advisor on 
international affairs, and Omar Salad Elmi, his former 
representative in Addis Ababa. 
  Aidid, who has been in Nairobi since UN-sponsored peace 
talks 
collapsed in December, met President Daniel arap Moi in the 
western Kenyan town of Nakuru on Tuesday morning, Kenyan 
officials said. "We're preparing for further consultations with 
other factions since Addis was a failure," Aidid's spokesman in 
Kenya, Abdullatif Afdub, told AFP. 
  A key Aidid ally, warlord Omar Jays, was also expected to 
arrive here on Tuesday from Addis Ababa later Tuesday, Somali 
sources said. Abdullatif was unable to confirm reports from 
Somali sources that Aidid's enemy, self-styled interim President 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, was also coming to Nairobi, possibly for 
Kenyan-mediated peace talks.

  [Text] Kampala, 25 Jan (KNA)--Two more Burundi Army 
officers who allegedly led the 21 October 1993 abortive coup 
d'etat, in which President Melchior Ndadaye was killed, have 
fled to Uganda, raising the number to four, according to the 
state-run daily NEW VISION. 
  In its Monday issue, the daily quoted Burundi Embassy 
officials in Kampala as saying that apart from Major Bernard 
Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda in 
November, "We have also learnt about the presence of two others 
in Kampala." He said one was a commando but promised to reveal 
their names later in the week. 
  Bujumbura alleges that Busokoza and Kamana entered Uganda 
through Zaire after the coup, in which President Ndadaye was 
killed on 21 October, had collapsed. 
  The embassy officials further claim that the four wanted 
officers are moving with forged Zairian passports and fake 
names. "At least we have seen them several times at Sheraton and 
Speke hotels in Kampala," they alleged in the interview with the 
NEW VISION. 
  Last Wednesday [19 January], the Burundi ambassador in 
Uganda, Leonidas Havyarimana, called on Uganda's internal 
security organization, ISO, chief Brigadier Jim Muhwezi and 
reportedly raised the same issue. Muhwezi is reported to have 
assured the envoy of Uganda's readiness to track down the wanted 
officers. 
  Uganda and Burundi have no extradition treaty, but on 2 
January, Muhwezi said if the coup plotters are captured here, 
then international law will be applied or other diplomatic 
avenues will be explored. 
  Other sources say President Yoweri Museveni had also assured 
Bujumbura authorities, who visited him on 30 December, that the 
suspects would be apprehended if found in Uganda. 
  Maj. Busokoza, who is said to be in his forties, had until 
the coup been managing director of Burundi Telecommunications. 
Kamana, described as a young officer in his thirties, was a 
paratrooper.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council on Tuesday changed the date for South Africa's first 
all-race general election from April 27 to April 28 and 29. 
Special votes will now be cast on April 27. It was also 
decided to declare Friday, April 29 a public holiday. 
  The council decision to alter the date was based on a 
recommendation from the seven-member management committee which 
steers the process. Concerns expressed by some council 
participants that the change could confuse voters were dismissed. 
  Voters will be able to cast their votes between 7am and 9pm 
on the polling days. 
  The council further decided to advise President F W de Klerk 
to proclaim the election date this Friday. Political observers 
explained parties would have 10 days from Friday, January 28 to 
register for the election. 
  Friday's proclamation effectively meant the final deadline 
for a political settlement between the government and the 
African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom Alliance could 
be stretched until the February 7 cut-off date for the 
registration of parties. 
  The ANC's Mac Maharaj, defending the date change, said the 
management committee believed the change "will not cause a 
serious disruption". He said the reason for the recommended 
change was to coincide with the last weekend in April. A 
countrywide voter education programme would ensure the new dates 
"will be firmly imprinted on people's minds".

  [Text] There are strong indications that one of the most 
burning issues in the run-up to the election could be the 
question of intimidation. The National Party [NP] took the bull 
by the horns today when its leader, F.W. de Klerk, signed a 
declaration committing the NP to a free and fair election 
without intimidation. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Ronel van Zyl] Today's signing 
of 
the declaration follows complaints by the NP about ANC [African 
National Congress] intimidation in general and specifically 
during Mr. De Klerk's western Transvaal road show over the 
weekend. During his three-day visit he was advised not to visit 
black townships. Mr. De Klerk said he had taken this advise 
because the ANC's strategy was to disrupt NP meetings and he 
wanted to avoid any confrontation. He said a later assurance by 
ANC leader Nelson Mandela that all areas should be accessible to 
all political parties was not enough. 
  [De Klerk, in progress] All parties must go further. I think 
parties must bind themselves to discipline their followers and 
to act in the case where calls are not heeded, where 
instructions are not followed. 
  [Van Zyl] In terms of the declaration, disciplinary steps 
will be taken against NP members found guilty of intimidation. 
Mr. De Klerk expressed the hope that other political parties 
would follow suit. The declaration offers a direct challenge to 
the ANC by leaving space for its leaders' signatures as well. 
As far as ongoing talks with the Freedom Alliance were 
concerned, Mr. De Klerk said negotiations would continue despite 
the deadline. 
  [De Klerk] Negotiations can continue and multiparty 
agreements can then, after an election, become part of the law 
of the land where all parties, or all significant parties, 
participate in a debate to reach an agreement and sign 
agreements with each other. It can be implemented and made law 
also after an election. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The chances for an inclusive 
constitutional settlement hung by a thread on Tuesday night 
after another failed round of trilateral talks involving the 
government, the African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom 
Alliance. The three sides were unable to break their 
months-long impasse, but the Freedom Alliance agreed to consider 
a written submission on the ANC's position on Thursday. A 
government spokesman confirmed another trilateral meeting could 
take place on Thursday if the Freedom Alliance Executive 
responded favourably to the ANC position paper. 
  Government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer remained optimistic 
a 
negotiated settlement was still possible. "The door should 
always remain open," Mr Meyer told SAPA afterwards. He said 
there were two options facing the three parties. They could 
conclude a deal by Thursday night, only hours before President F 
W de Klerk proclaimed the April 27-29 election dates on Friday. 
  Political parties have 10 days from proclamation to register 
their participation in the election. 
  Mr Meyer explained once the election had been proclaimed it 
would be virtually impossible to call a special parliamentray 
session to amend the constitution. 
  The other option was that the parties could reach a kind of 
"gentlemen's agreement" in terms of which the government of 
national unity would make certain changes to the constitution 
immediately after it assumed power. However, Freedom Alliance 
adviser Mario Ambrossini on Tuesday night said he doubted 
whether the ANC would produce anything which warranted optimism. 
"The talking is over," he said. 
  ANC negotiator Thabo Mbeki, who gave the undertaking to 
provide the Freedom Alliance with the ANC's position in writing, 
denied Tuesday's talks suffered a "complete breakdown". There 
was still room to build on what had transpired at the talks. 
  According to the Freedom Alliance, the change in fortunes 
during the latest round of negotiations occurred late on Monday 
night. The ANC made a "complete backward somersault" 20 minutes 
before the end of seven hours of talks, Alliance Chairman Rowan 
Cronje told a press conference at the Bophuthatswana Embassy on 
Tuesday night. He was flanked by Inkatha Freedom Party 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Bophuthatswana President Lucas 
Mangope, Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, 
and Generals Constand Viljoen and Tienie Groenewald of the 
Afrikaner Volksfront. Mr Cronje said little or no progress had 
been made on a number of their demands, including for one 
instead of two ballot papers; more exclusive powers for the 
provinces; and, greater provincial constitution- making powers. 
Some progress had been made on the right of provinces to impose 
and collect their own taxes. He didn't mention the Freedom 
Alliance demand for a Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. 
  "At the end we came to the conclusion we have come to the 
end 
of the road as far as negotiations are concerned," Mr Cronje 
said. "There has been very little give on the part of the other 
side." 
  CP negotiator Tom Langley said the government and the ANC 
were "conniving" against the Freedom Alliance. "It can be very, 
very bad for the country," he told SAPA. "I think they have a 
secret agenda, which is part of their (1992) record of 
understanding." Part of the alleged agenda was to drive a wedge 
between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Mr Buthelezi, and to 
break up the Freedom Alliance, according to Mr Langley. 
  Mr Buthelezi told the media he had been put in a difficult 
position by the fact King Zwelithini had recently met with Mr De 
Klerk, who had given the king "certain undertakings". The IFP 
leader did not elaborate. 
  Gen Viljoen said he remained committed to negotiations 
despite the latest talks outcome. "One must keep on negotiating 
until all the options are exhausted. The alternative is too 
ghastly too contemplate." 
  The CP's Dr Corne Mulder told SAPA those at the negotiating 
table "are the moderates". "We've pushed this process to try to 
get an inclusive settlement. "If there's not a settlement the 
moderates will be swept aside and the radicals will move in."

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The constitution could still

said there was still hope an accord might be struck between the 
Alliance, the government and the African National Congress 
[ANC], adding there were some "sensible" proposals on the table. 
  His indications after Tuesday's extraordinary cabinet 
meeting 
for a report-back on Monday's trilateral talks were that "they 
have moved relatively nearer to each other and that the 
differences are bridgeable". "We will continue to make every 
possible effort to ensure through negotiations their 
participation is ensured," Mr De Klerk said. He stressed there 
were time constraints but added the government was doing its 
utmost to avoid negotiations coming to an end. Failure to reach 
an agreement did not mean negotiations would necessarily come to 
an end. "If there is firm multiparty agreement, amendments to 
the constitution can then after the election become part of the 
law of the land," Mr De Klerk said. 
  Turning to a possible boycott of the elections by the 
Freedom 
Alliance, Mr De Klerk said it would be a "most unwise" decision. 
The ANC had tried that with the elections of the tricameral 
parliament and had succeeded in bringing down the voting 
percentages but could not stop the three-chamber parliament 
which had made a tremendous contribution to the transition 
process, he said. "Boycotting is an 'alien' method to use for 
political parties when it comes to elections." The ANC had on 
its election list a number of people who had been "trained" in 
that very parliament, he added. 
  Mr De Klerk said he intended to probe the "weak spots" 
reflected in the ANC's election candidate list but would not 
elaborate further. He said he would proclaim the elections at 
the "earliest possible moment".

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Tuesday demanded the government suspend its 
planned salary increases for senior civil servants. The 
resolution evoked controversy within the TEC as government and 
National Party representatives rejected it. Government 
representative Fanie van der Merwe and the NP's Leon Wessels 
argued the TEC had recommended its finance sub-council 
investigate the increases and report to the TEC next week. Any 
TEC decision on the increases should be made only after the 
sub-council had delivered its report, they argued. 
  The increases were reported in a Sunday newspaper which 
speculated their effect would be to dramatically boost civil 
servants' pensions for retirees after the April elections. Mr 
Van Der Merwe said the TEC had no way of knowing who exactly 
would be affected by its decision. The resolution was carried 
with government and NP disagreement.

  [Text] Durban Jan 26 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples 
Organisation [Azapo] will step up its programme of opposition to 
the April elections and intensify the armed struggle until land 
is restored to blacks in South Africa, it said in Durban on 
Wednesday. 
  "We in Azapo will intensify the struggle in all forms and 
all 
the components of the black consciousness movement, including 
the Azanian Liberation Army [Azanla], are urged to fight to the 
bitter end," Azapo Natal Chairman Patrick Mkhize told a press 
conference. 
  Blacks had been sold out by deals struck at the Kempton Park 
negotiating forum and Azapo was distributing more than 10 
million pamphlets advising blacks not to participate in the 
"sham elections", he said. 
  Azapo would also prevent the National Party and the 
Democratic Party from recruiting black support in townships, he 
added. Mr Mkhize said the black consciousness army, the Azanian 
Liberation Army, would intensify its military campaign although 
there was no specific programme of action against the April poll. 
  "Azanla will continue to fight until people are free," he 
said. Only when land "stolen from black people by settlers" had 
been returned would there be true liberation. Voting in the 
April elections would be tantamount to blacks "rubber stamping 
the selling of their land for life", he maintained. 
  Mr Mkhize said he could not elaborate on Azanla's military 
agenda as "it has its own programme of action". He stressed, 
however, that Azanla would never become part of the national 
peace keeping force but would become "the army of the people 
when South Africa is free". 
  Asked whether Azanla would continue armed action after the 
elections, he replied: "As long as the aspirations of black 
people have not been met the struggle continues." 
  He said the questions of homelessness, landlessness, poverty 
and hunger had not been addressed by Kempton Park negotiators. 
  Mr Mkhize claimed Azapo was daily gaining support and had 
more than 20,000 members in Natal.

  [By Craig Doonan] 
  [Text] Durban Jan 25 SAPA -- About 30 disgruntled members of 
the African National Congress [ANC] in northern Natal began a 
sit-in at the ANC's Empangeni regional offices on Tuesday 
afternoon, demanding fresh elections for a regional executive 
committee. An official who wished to remain unidentified said 
about 30 members had occupied the office's reception area by 3PM 
but "more are on the way". 
  The ANC's northern Natal region has been riddled with 
division among the leadership, particularly after last year's 
elections in which former regional chairman Aaron Ndlovu was 
ousted and a number of trade unionists were installed in top 
positions. Among them is the new regional chairman Bheki Ntuli 
who, when telephoned about the sit-in on Tuesday, said: "Yes, 
there are problems, but let us handle them first." He could 
barely be heard above the noise from protesters in the office. 
  The protesters' primary grievance was the "irregular" 
appointment of the new regional executive committee, said the 
official. He said there was a number of discrepancies in the 
November elections, including unfair lobbying and voting by 
unauthorized delegates. "The people here want fresh elections 
and are unhappy with the way elections were conducted last 
year," he said. 
  Other demands included greater security for ANC members in 
the region and a halt to negotiations with the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP]. 
  The new regional committee is dominated by perceived 
"moderates" who reportedly favour negotiations with the IFP in a 
region characterised by bloody political conflict. 
  Internal tensions in northern Natal led to a commission of 
inquiry last year and intervention by ANC National Deputy 
Secretary Walter Sisulu earlier this year. The inquiry examined 
grievances about last year's regional elections and recommended 
they be declared null and void and the election be held again, 
according to a confidential ANC letter in SAPA's possession. 
However, the letter states that a "self-centred" and 
"malicious" member of the ANC's national working committee, had 
with "unbridled" ambition manipulated the recommendations and 
the newly elected committee remained intact. 
  When Mr Sisulu stepped in it was agreed that a 
"reconciliation" committee, comprising three members of each of 
the opposing groups, oversee the running of the region and 
attempt to resolve the dispute, said SAPA's informant. "But the 
current regional committee is taking unilateral decisions and 
people are unhappy," he added. He said Tuesday's sit-in would 
continue until "our demands have been attended to".

  [Text] Durban Jan 25 SAPA -- The kwaZulu government and the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] were totally committed to full 
participation in new local government structures, senior IFP 
official Peter Miller repeated on Tuesday. Speaking at a local 
government seminar in Durban, Mr Miller said there should be "no 
question" about kwaZulu and the IFP's commitment to the Local 
Government Transition Act which was signed into law last week. 
This was in spite of the IFP and kwaZulu government having 
withdrawn from national negotiations on the act. 
  At the signing of the act last week, Mr Miller caused 
excitement when he said the IFP would "participate fully and 
absolutely in third-tier government". Some political observers 
said his announcement might have paved the way for IFP 
participation in national elections on April 27. However, IFP 
national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said Mr Miller was probably just 
expressing his own "hopeful" opinion. But, speaking in 
Pietermaritzburg on Monday, Mr Miller said IFP leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi had personally endorsed his party's full participation 
in new, democratic local government structures. 
  In Durban on Tuesday, Mr Miller said he also had the full 
backing of the kwaZulu government in committing it to 
participation in transitional local government structures. 
"We'll participate fully. We want to be part of the solution, 
not the problem. Let's go into this process together, 
determined to make it work." 
  While Mr Miller is known to support IFP participation in the 
April 27 elections, a final decision on the party's stance will 
become clear only at the weekend at a special general conference 
in Ulundi.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 25 SAPA -- Suspended Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] National Publicity Director Waters Toboti on 
Tuesday said he had not threatened to unleash chaos if his 
suspension went ahead. Mr Toboti said in a statement to SAPA 
his comments on Radio Transkei earlier on Tuesday were in Xhosa 
and had not been properly translated in subsequent reports. 
"What I said was people who suspend members of the organisation 
on false premises are causing chaos and division in the party." 
  Mr Toboti said he still had not been told of his suspension. 
Earlier, Jaki Seroke of the PAC's publicity and information 
office told SAPA they were having difficulty contacting Mr 
Toboti to tell him of his suspension. 
  On Saturday the PAC announced the suspension of Mr Toboti, 
Central Transkei Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha and Azanian 
National Youth Unity member Chargin Mabaso with immediate effect 
for criticising the PAC's suspension of its armed struggle. 
  Mr Seroke added the PAC had no interest in getting involved 
in a "slanging match" with Mr Toboti. A decision had been 
taken, he said.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  SACP Influence in ANC Unknown, Confusing Factor -- The South 
African Communist Party (SACP) has "been thrown on the defensive 
by charges that it is a dominant -- and manipulative -- 
influence in the ANC [African National Congress]," states a page 
14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 January. 
"SACP spokesman Jeremy Cronin, attempting to neutralise the 
propaganda, says only 34 of the 200 candidates are SACP 
members." THE STAR believes, however, Cronin's explanation 
"will not spike his opponents' guns as long as the dividing line 
between SACP and ANC remains blurred. It is difficult to know 
where the SACP ends and the ANC begins, in regard to policy as 
well as membership." "Those who favour the ANC have to 
recognise that a vote for the ANC is simultaneously a vote for 
the SACP, that the endorsement of bourgeois capitalists in the 
ANC is at the same time endorsement of the SACP's `democratic 
socialists'. The sooner the SACP campaigns under its own 
manifesto and stands or falls under its own banner, the better 
for South Africa." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC, Government `Obsession' To Close Radio Pretoria -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 January in a page 4 
editorial says the National Party and the ANC's "obsession with 
closing down Radio Pretoria and other right-wing radio stations 
calls into question their political judgment, and highlights 
their similar approach when it comes to dealing with political 
opposition." The courts have ruled that Radio Pretoria is 
operating unlawfully, but this "legalistic approach," is 
"inappropriate," and "a transparent attempt by government to 
evade responsibility for its own decision." BUSINESS DAY hopes 
it is a matter of time "before the airwaves are deregulated 
sufficiently to render unlawful the operations of quaint 
right-wing groups and others. In the meantime, given that the 
regulations are something of an ass anyway, it would make sense 
to turn a blind eye to technical contraventions." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  To End Township Rent Boycott Not Easy -- The call by ANC 
President Nelson Mandela for an end to the "decade-long rent and 
service charges boycott would well provide the incoming 
government of national unity with one of its most intractable 
problems," points out Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 23 
January in a page 14 editorial. To upgrade townships to 
acceptable levels is going to require "billions of rands and 
decades to achieve. And therein lies the trouble: While these 
grievances remain, some people will feel inclined to continue 
with the boycott. The culture of non-payment is now deeply 
ingrained among residents and no matter how popular Mandela and 
the ANC might be, persuading people to end the boycott is not 
going to be easy." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Concern Over Number of `Communists' in ANC Election List -- 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 24 January in its page 8 
editorial focuses on the ANC's strategy in its selection of 
parliamentary candidates. "There are the expected 
representatives of the internal, as well as the external wings 
of the ANC. The internal wing is further divided into two -- 
the so-called 'Robben Island factor' and those that conducted 
the struggle from within structures of the national government." 
What is "disturbing," however, are the number of members from 
the South African Communist Party, who, "according to some 
sources, represent 13 names of the top 20 names on the list." 
"Should the ANC get what opinion polls indicate, the major part 
of ANC representation in the cabinet will therefore be 
communists." They will be able to hold key portfolios such as 
labor matters, information and security. The editorial further 
focuses attention on the implications and dangers of having so 
many communist members in government, and concludes: "That 
there are several potential sharks in the ANC's wave of 
candidates rolling toward us must not be doubted."

  [Text] Cotonou, 25 Jan (AFP)--BENIN PRESS AGENCY [ABP] has 
disclosed that on 25 January, the Beninese Government banned a 
demonstration called for by unions in protest against the social 
repercussions of the 11 January CFA franc devaluation. 
  The press agency disclosed that security forces were 
positioned around the Labor Exchange and prevented thousands of 
people from going to the meeting point. According to ABP, the 
organizers of the demonstration subsequently called off the 
strike, accusing the government of not "respecting union 
freedom." They stated: "We will fight to the end," adding that 
they would "consult the grass roots" before deciding what to do. 
  On 20 January, the unions called for a 120-percent salary 
increase and an over 300-percent increase in the statutory 
minimum wage to offset the increase in prices brought on by the 
devaluation. 
  The CFA franc has been devalued by 50 percent in relation to 
the French franc, which was its currency of reference and 
convertibility. The exchange rate is now 1Fr to 100 CFA francs 
instead of the previous rate of 1Fr to 50 CFA francs. 
  On 23 January, President Nicephore Soglo reiterated that a 
price freeze on basic commodities and a series of fiscal relief 
measures had been decided upon. He agreed to the "principle" of 
a salary adjustment but urged workers to accept a reasonable 
salary increase to avoid a damaging and illusory competition 
between salary and prices. 
  [Paris AFP in French at 1506 GMT on 25 January in a similar, 
Cotonou-datelined item adds: "It has been observed in Cotonou 
that several thousands of people who tried to meet at the 
Cotonou Labor Exchange on 25 January in response to a call by 
six unions dispersed in the early afternoon without incident 
after security forces had prevented them from gathering there. 
At 1400 GMT, police were still patrolling the city center, 
banning all meetings. 
  ["The union leaders, who had called for the strike in 
protest 
against the social repercussions of the 11 January CFA franc 
devaluation, have denounced the government's "antidemocratic 
attitude" and decided not to attend the working session they 
were supposed to have held in the afternoon with President 
Nicephore Soglo. 
  ["In a communique issued on 24 January, the interior 
minister 
justified the banning of the demonstration by saying that he was 
informed of the organizers' intention to round off the meeting 
with a march through the city only at the last minute. 
  ["Minister Antoine Alabi Gbegan told AFP on 25 January: 
`This 
march was not included in their initial request for permission 
to hold the meeting. I, therefore, preferred to ban the 
demonstration to avoid any incidents.'"]

  [Excerpts] President Soglo held consultations with 
businessmen at the Presidential Palace this morning. The 
meeting lasted more than three hours and focused on the effects 
of the devaluation on commercial activity. [passage omitted] 
  Trade unions did not attend this afternoon's scheduled 
meeting with President Soglo in protest against the ban on this 
morning's briefing rally. [passage omitted] 
  In a communique issued this afternoon, the trade unions that 
have formed the interunion crisis committee said the ban is a 
violation of union freedom. The unions and organizers are 
basing their argument on a series of factors in an attempt to 
prove that they are being muzzled by President Soglo's 
government. In concrete terms, they pointed out that the 
interior minister's reply to the interunion crisis committee's 
letter on this morning's meeting did not in any way question the 
holding of the meeting. Besides, the unions maintained that the 
holding of a union meeting has never required prior permission 
from the authorities. 
  The interunion crisis committee also protested against the 
interior minster's radio statement, which it described as 
untrue, and claimed it could lead to confusion. Concerning the 
interior minister's radio statement on the 1315 news, the unions 
[words indistinct] directed at them. Furthermore, in light of 
this offensive, which the unions think is targeted at them, they 
are making an urgent appeal to all workers to be on standby to 
follow directives and orders from the interunion crisis meeting. 
Finally, the unions in question, namely (CSA-Benin), (CGPD), 
(RSTB), (CFEB), (PINAD), (SYNTRAPAC), (SYNARES), (SYNCITRACEP) 
[expansions unknown], convene their activists for a briefing and 
protest meeting at the Cotonou Labor Exchange at 0800 on 1 
February.

The head of state, His Excellency Henri Konan Bedie, this 
morning appointed a new Supreme Court president. He is Michel 
Koui Mamadou. Soon after his appointment, the new Supreme Court 
president resigned from his post of deputy and announced that he 
would leave the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire-African 
Democratic Rally [PDCI-RDA] because of the new responsibilities 
assigned to him. Here is the new president's statement soon 
after his appointment: 
  [Begin Mamadou recording] His Excellency President Henri 
Konan Bedie has just honored me by appointing me to the high 
office of the president of the Supreme Court of Cote d'Ivoire. 
In this solemn moment, I would like to sincerely thank him for 
fully trusting me--trust that I will strive to further serve. 
[passage omitted] 
  I would like to stress that while accepting the functions of 
president of the high institution that President Henri Konan 
Bedie has assigned to me, I will automatically give up the post 
of deputy that I have been occupying. I cannot be a judge and 
parliamentarian at the same. My resignation is effective 
immediately. Similary, as of today I give up all my functions 
within the PDCI-RDA steering organs because of the neutrality 
demanded by my new responsibilities. [end recording]

  [Text] The National Executive Bureau [BEN] of the National 
Union of Mali Workers [UNTM] held an extraordinary meeting 
yesterday. It called for a 50-percent general salary increase. 
The BEN also denounced the negative effects of successive 
structural adjustment programs. This reaction follows the 
50-percent devaluation of the CFA franc. At the end of the 
meeting, the BEN issued a statement read here by Mamadou 
Doumbouya. 
  [Begin Doumbouya recording] The UNTM National Executive 
Bureau held an extraordinary session on 24 January. Drawing 
lessons from decades of development, it observed that Mali has 
been engaged in structural adjustment programs for more than 12 
years. Mali is one of the rare countries to have fully 
implemented all the social and economic measures jointly adopted 
by the IMF, World Bank, and the government to ensure the 
country's economic and financial balance. The structural 
adjustment programs created great chaos by sanctioning the 
liquidation of state companies and enterprises, causing the 
reduction of the salaried workforce through a wave of 
unprecedented retrenchments, and fostering voluntary retirement. 
  The Malian franc, which is the expression of national 
sovereignty and an independent national development work tool, 
disappeared in favor of the CFA at the pegged rate of Fr1 to one 
Malian franc. The country's return to the West African Monetary 
Union [UMOA] in 1984, the recent devaluation of the CFA franc, 
and the adoption of a blind liberal economic system have 
currently led to a dramatic erosion of workers' purchasing power 
by 117.50 percent. This has also led to unbridled price 
increases despite appeals by government and the Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry of Mali. 
  The various kinds of privatizations accepted by workers and 
the Malian people have only resulted in the deterioration of 
their living conditions, which they hoped to improve in the new 
multiparty and democratic context. Now more than ever, Mali, 
like former French colonies, is no longer free to determine its 
own economic and political options in the spirit of safeguarding 
African dignity. 
  Consequently, the BEN strongly calls for the return to the 
use of a local Malian currency within a time period compatible 
with the Malian people's thirst for dignity. In default of 
this, Mali must pledge to strive for the creation of a common 
independent African currency. The BEN calls for the total and 
immediate payment of promotion arrears that have accumulated 
from 1987 to 1993; a 50-percent general salary increase; a 
50-percent reduction in IGER [expansion unknown] and its total 
abolition for salaried female workers; and a 50-percent rise in 
the guaranteed minimum wage, as well as a corresponding 
readjustment of retirement and widows benefits. The BEN warns 
the government against any eventual failure to ensure state 
authority in the enforcement of the freeze on essential 
commodities and the effective and permanent control. 
  In the face of the capitulation of the UMOA heads of state 
summit on 10 and 11 January in Dakar, the UNTM, which is 
traditionally attentive to state problems, cannot endorse 
measures that assault the dignity of Africans and the real 
independence of our country and forever compromise Africa's 
development. It makes a vibrant appeal to all Malian workers 
and the entire people to get mobilized wholeheartedly for the 
defense of national interests. It calls on African trade union 
federations to get more involved to work for the emergence of an 
economically integrated, politically free, and socially 
prosperous Africa. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 25 Jan (AFP)--The policy making body of the 
human rights group Campaign for Democracy (CD) has passed a vote 
of confidence in its national chairman, after he was accused of 
collaboration with the military. The vote of confidence was 
revealed in a communique issued here Tuesday [25 January] on the 
outcome of an emergency meeting of CD's National Coordination 
Council, held at the weekend in Lagos. 
  Last Tuesday, CD secretary-general Chima Ubani accused 
chairman Beko Ransome-Kuti of "collaborating" with the military 
and "compromising" the CD, the umbrella group for pro-democracy 
and human rights associations in Nigeria. Ransome-Kuti has 
denied the charges. 
  A two-day national convention of the CD is scheduled to 
begin 
February 4, during which issues related to the association's 
internal problems as well as its future approach to national 
matters are expected to be discussed.

  [Text] Lagos, Jan 25 (AFP)--A senior lawyer and human 
rights activist, Gani Fawehinmi, has issued a court challenge to 
the composition of the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), 
Nigeria's highest decision-making body. 
  In a suit filed in a federal high court here Monday here, 
Fawehinmi asked the court to declare that the make-up of the 
council violates the "federal character" provision of the 1979 
constitution. 
  The main element is that four states that are home to the 
Ibo 
ethnic group in eastern Nigeria--Abia, Anambra, Enugu and Imo 
states--have only one representative on the 11-member PRC. 
  Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Allison Madueke, is the 
only member of Ibo origin. Six other members are from the 
north, three from the west and one from a south-western minority 
group. 
  Fawehinmi said that minority groups who populate Akwa Ibom, 
Cross River and Rivers states, whence comes most of the crude 
oil that contributes more than 90 percent of the nation's annual 
revenue, are unrepresented. The council's composition, he 
argued, is against the spirit of "federal character" and 
inimical to national unity. 
  Under the "federal character" policy contained in the 1979 
constitution, each of Nigeria's 30 states should be given equal 
consideration when making appointments into national bodies, 
organisations or agencies in order to promote national unity and 
command national loyalty. 
  According to Fawehinmi, renowned for devoting more than 20 
years of his professional career to fighting for the rights of 
the poor and the underprivileged, the non-inclusion of any 
representative of the three minority states from the east in the 
PRC violates the 1979 constitution. 
  The constitution was reinstated by decree 107, promulgated 
shortly after General Sani Abacha took power last November, 
replacing a short-lived unelected civilian regime that had been 
installed in August by the outgoing junta of Genera Ibrahim 
Babangida. 
  By going to the court to challenge the PRC's composition, 
Fawehinmi has added legal weight to complaints of 
"marginalisation" made against the government early this month 
by a group of Ibos. 
  In a one-page advertisement in DAILY TIMES newspaper of last 
January 12, a group calling itself "Concerned Igbos" (or Ibos), 
alleged that since the end of the Nigerian civil ("Biafra") war 
in January 1970, the Ibos have been "persecuted, condemned and 
sacrificed". 
  An estimated one million people, including women and 
children, died in the war which lasted for 30 months. An 
attempt by the east to secede from the rest of the country 
triggered off the bloody war. 
  The group also alleged that the Ibos have been denied 
prominent ministerial positions and posts in the federal public 
service, rarely appointed to head federal agencies or given 
either ambassadorial positions or "effective command of body of 
troops". They specifically cited the fact that there is only one 
of their own number in the PRC, despite the fact that the Ibos 
represent one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria. 
  Apart from the Ibos, several minority groups, particularly 
the Ogonis in south-eastern Rivers State, have recently 
heightened agitation for justice and fair distribution of the 
nation's revenue. 
  In the heat of a nation's political crisis after Babangida 
annulled the outcome of a civilian presidential election last 
June, six of the seven states in the eastern part of Nigeria 
threatened to secede over what they called the injustice meted 
to them by the federal government in the sharing out of the 
nation's resources and political offices.

  [Text] Dakar, 25 Jan (AFP)--Senegal and the IMF have signed 
a "letter of intent" by which Senegal will receive a 
27-billion-CFA franc financial package, official sources 
disclosed in Dakar this evening. The agreement also provides 
for a 40-billion-CFA franc annual grant to Senegal over a period 
of three years as part of the backup measures following the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  A similar letter of intent is expected to be signed between 
Senegal and the World Bank this week, according to World Bank 
sources. Jean-Louis Sarbib, head of the Sahel division of the 
World Bank, told the media that an "agreement has been reached" 
and that "the Senegalese authorities are expected to announce 
this and to give details of the decisions made."

  [Text] Ulundi Jan 26 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he is not optimistic 
Thursday's talks between the government, the African National 
Congress [ANC] and the Freedom Alliance will lead to an 
inclusive constitutional settlement. In a statement issued on 
Wednesday Mr Buthelezi said: "I am not overly optimistic after 
the experience of the kind of games that the ANC, in tandem with 
the government and the National Party, has been playing with us 
in these so-called negotiations." 
  However, "We must of course leave no stone unturned in our 
search for a consitutional settlement and we will have to make 
this last attempt on Thursday". 
  Regarding the IFP's participation in the general election, 
Mr 
Buthelezi asked: "Why should the ANC want us in the election if 
we really are their true opposition and if we are the only party 
which could stop them taking control of the legislature in this 
region?" 
  "We will have to face the facts now that we have to go to 
the 
conference to tell delegates about the failure of negotiations 
and face the conference with the need to finally put to bed the 
issue of whether or not we enter elections," he said. 
  "I say this constitution is fatally flawed and that there is 
no future for kwazulu and for self-determination for the people 
of this region or any other region in it". 
  Mr Buthelezi warned of civil war and said: "We will never 
have peace, stability and prosperity if we repeat the failure of 
Russia and East Europe to recognise that centrist constitutions 
imposed over a plural society, in which there are competing 
demands for self-determination, can only give rise to 
disruption, violence and finally civil war". 
  The IFP is seeking a federal constitution with a division of 
power between the central and state governments. The IFP has 
also opposed the proposed deadlock-breaking mechanism which 
"inter alia enable a constitutional assembly to completely 
rewrite the constitution with only a 50 percent plus on 
majority". 
  The IFP is also demanding two votes per person in the 
election.

recommendations on the party's participation in the general 
election for the upcoming IFP national conference because 
constitutional negotiations have not been completed. 
  Trilateral negotiations between the government, the African 
National Congress and the Freedom Alliance, of which the IFP is 
a member, are to resume on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to 
ensure the alliance's participation in the election. 
  The IFP Central Committee in a statement on Wednesday night 
also expressed concern that the lack of progress in separate 
negotiations on the position of the Zulu king and kingdom would 
"impair the ability of (the) conference to consider what course 
of action to adopt and to come to a final decision as to the 
IFP's responsibility to South Africa in regard to the 
forthcoming elections".

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Fabricius in Washington] </F>
  [Text] President Clinton hates distractions. Examine his 
speeches, statements and interviews and you will find several 
annoyed references to this or that "distraction" from his main 
policy goals. 
  Loathing distraction is the meritorious hallmark of someone 
with a mission. But it may also be the sign of someone who is 
too single-minded, too determined to control the agenda -- and 
inadequately prepared for the unexpected. It is the unexpected 
that Clinton has to watch for in 1994. 
  Clinton, the man with a mission was very much in evidence in 
his first State of the Union speech on Tuesday. He displayed 
the rather frenzied energy and drive of a Cecil John Rhodes. 
One could imagine him being dragged out of the White House in a 
few years' time muttering, "so much to do, so little done." He 
could invoke many solid achievements in his one year in office 
so far, including cutting the gigantic American deficit by $500 
billion and helping set the economy back on the road to 
recovery, passing the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
securing a GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] 
agreement, getting Ukraine, Belarus and Khazakstan to agree to 
scrap their nuclear weapons, pushing through legislation to 
control guns, allowing students to work off loans, offering 
leave to workers who have to tend sick family -- the list goes 
on. 
  Working with a meagre 43 percent of the vote, he got over 86 
percent of his legislation through Congress, a strike rate 
beaten since World War 2 only by Johnson and Eisenhower. After 
a year of incredible ups and downs when his public approval 
rating fell to 37 percent at one point, he is again riding high 
at around 60 percent -- his highest rate since taking office -- 
and 17 percentage points above his vote in the elections. Polls 
show that the economy -- the big issue of his election campaign 
-- is now receding as a concern of Americans, largely because it 
is improving. 
  The economy has been replaced as a public concern by crime, 
welfare reform and health care, in that order. In his state of 
the union speech Clinton threw himself into those issues with 
enthusiasm. Confounding many cautious voices in his own party, 
he announced he would tackle two difficult, major reform tasks 
at the same time -- health care and welfare -- as well as 
several crime measures. 
  Health care reform will by itself be an enormous 
undertaking, 
involving a revamp of the health industry. The Republican Party 
is opposed to this, so a major legislative battle will ensue. 
Add to that welfare reform -- a controversial plan to terminate 
welfare payments to anyone who has been on it for two years -- 
and several other initiatives, and you have the making of 
another bumpy year. 
  And yet achieving his ambitious agenda may not be Clinton's 
biggest worry. In 1993 he showed himself remarkably resilient 
when focused and committed. The problem may instead be those 
"distractions." Chief among them could be "Whitewatergate," the 
web of vague accusations about improper dealings between 
Arkansas Governor Clinton and a failed savings and loan company. 
  After resisting pressure for a special counsel to examine 
the 
allegations, Clinton gave in, saying that if he had not, the 
affair might have distracted from his policy goals. This had 
the desired effect. The press subsided. But the investigation 
could still be a ticking time bomb. 
  Other potential distractions are in foreign affairs and 
defence. Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti all intruded last year, 
threatening to distract Clinton from his domestic agenda. These 
volcanoes are not quite dormant yet and others still more 
explosive -- such as Russia -- may be lurking. There is an 
aspect of being president which Clinton seems to shun. That is 
simply being on watch, ready to deal with whatever comes up -- 
even if it's not on the agenda.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 27 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] and the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] agreed to 
canvass white and black parties for two ballot papers in the 
April elections. PAC and IFP Presidents Clarence Makwetu and 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi met in Johannesburg on Thursday morning and 
discussed the ballot system and violence. 
  "The PAC and the IFP decided to contact the Democratic 
Party, 
Dikwankwetla Party and others in favour of the two-ballot system 
to develop joint strategies to ensure that the fraudulent 
undemocratic one-ballot system does not take place," PAC 
President Clarence Makwetu told a press conference afterwards. 
  PAC Political Secretary Jaki Seroke said later the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] and the Conservative Party 
might also be approached. 
  Mr Makwetu and Mr Buthelezi agreed violence could jeopardise 
the elections and suggested meetings between them and the 
African National Congress [ANC]. "Joint activities between the 
PAC, the IFP and the ANC is the route along which the solution 
should be found," Mr Makwetu said. 
  Mr Buthelezi said the PAC last year offered to mediate 
between the ANC and the IFP, but the ANC had rejected the offer.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 27 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he is not optimistic 
about the outcome of protracted constitutional talks between the 
African National Congress [ANC], government and Freedom 
Alliance. Addressing a press conference after meeting Pan 
Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence Makwetu in 
Johannesburg on Thursday, Mr Buthelezi said the alliance was 
waiting for a written compromise by ANC Chairman Thabo Mbeki 
before talks resumed on Friday. 
  "But frankly, I am not optimistic about it. Nevertheless, 
since we are determined to do everything in our power to find a 
solution we feel we should do that and go the whole hog in 
trying to reach an agreement." 
  On changing the April elections from a single ballot paper 
for national and regional candidates to a two-ballot system, Mr 
Buthelezi said ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had refused 
to discuss the issue. He said agreement on a two-ballot system 
would help in getting the IFP to participate in the election, 
but indicated outstanding consitutional issues such as stronger 
regional powers would also have to be settled. 
  The IFP leader said a delegation for Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini was discussing the ballot issue with the government. 
"The king said he would not encourgage his amakhosi, the chiefs, 
and his people to participate in elections if the single-ballot 
system was imposed on his people."

  [ANC Statement on NP Allegations of Communist manipulation 
issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The National Party's [NP] hysteria about the 
inclusion 
of SACP [South African Communist Party] members in the ANC 
[African National Congress] election list is reflective of 
undemocratic traditions which this party represents. It is 
instructive that this campaign issues from parties of the white 
establishment. The ANC remains convinced that this has nothing 
to do with the 34 SACP members in the ANC national list of 200 
for the constituent assembly nor the deliberate security police 
type lie about the so-called "sleeping members". 
  It is quite clear that this is a pre-planned campaign timed 
to coincide with the release of the ANC national list to the 
public. The aim remains to divert people's attention from 
crucial issues facing the downtrodden people: violence and the 
dismal track record of the NP over the years. This is because 
the NP has no answers to offer. 
  The ANC list includes persons of integrity who fought 
against 
the apartheid system: believers Christians, Hindus, Muslims, 
Jews, communists, democratic nationalists and patriots who 
believe in a non-racial democracy and a better life for all 
South Africans. It is a truly South African list of democrats 
chosen in a transparent and democratic manner. 
  All the candidates will campaign under the ANC banner, 
pursue 
the ANC platform and policy in Parliament. For this democratic 
practice we owe the NP and its allies in the apartheid 
establishment no apology. 
  What the ANC would like the np to tell the public, though, 
is 
how it is preparing its own lists- their silence in this matter 
id deafening. We are extremely concerned at this witch-hunt 
against illustrious fighters against apartheid. On the one hand 
it has brought to the fore some of the worst characteristics in 
the life of the NP: 
  Suppression from 1950 to the 80's had in its definition of 
all opponents of apartheid as communists. Its fascist approach 
to campaigns, that the more a "big lie" is told, the more people 
believe it. We are therefore bound to ask: where is the new 
National Party? 
  The ANC remains concerned that negative campaigns of this 
nature, have in the past been followed by assassinations and 
attempts on the lives of leaders of the ANC and its allies. We 
genuinely hope that the media will not find themselves used 
unwittingly for these machinations of the NP and its allies. We 
wish to remind them that it was first the Communist Party in the 
50's, then the ANC in the 60's, religious leaders and students 
in the 70's and 80's and then the media, which suffered from the 
political intolerance of the National Party.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 26 SAPA -- People's forums could be 
institutionalised under an African National Congress [ANC] 
government, ANC spokesman Dr. Pallo Jordan said on Wednesday. 
He was addressing the press in Johannesburg where he promised 
an "American-style" launch for the organisation's election 
manifesto on Saturday, the day before ANC President Nelson 
Mandela hits the western Transvaal election trail. 
  Dr. Jordan said people's forums could become a feature of an 
ANC government and not just the organisation's election drive. 
"Most times, folks in this country get talked at by 
politicians. It's unusual for politicians to be talked at by 
ordinary folks on the ground. As a form of participation 
democracy we think we have pioneered something which could be 
institutionalised in the future, both as a measure of 
encouraging interaction between government and popular people, 
and also as a form of accountability." 
  On Saturday's manifesto launch at Nasrec [convention center] 
near Johannesburg, Mr Jordan said the occasion would be 
"American-style" with the fanfare, but "unlike an American 
launch, it will provide food for thought". 
  Mr Mandela will travel to Rustenberg, Stilfontein, 
Potchefstroom and Ikageng on Sunday and Monday before visiting 
his old Victor Verster Prison near Cape Town from where he will 
go to a nearby stadium to light a flame of freedom. 
  The ANC leader, accompanied by other Rivonia trialists, will 
also revisit Robben Island on February 11 to mark the fourth 
anniversary of Mr Mandela's release from prison. 
  On Friday next week the ANC leader will resume the election 
trail in the Orange Free State where he will visit Sasolburg, 
Bothaville, Kroonstad, Odendaalsrus, Thabong and the national 
peacekeeping force base at De Brug near Bloemfontein.

  [Text] The ANC's [African National Congress] plan to deploy 
40,000 of its so-called peace keepers at polling stations has 
elicited sharp criticism. The chairman of the Independent 
Electoral Commission, Judge Kriegler, was reluctant to comment. 
He said it would be inopportune to do this as an official 
report on the issue could be tabled before the commission. 
  The ANC said at a conference in Midrand that peace keepers 
would man routes leading to polling booths and in so doing 
prevent intimidation. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel says 
it boils down to a threat to intimidate voters. He said such a 
step was extremely provocative and a recipe for violence. 
  The National Party said the plan is strongly reminiscent of 
a 
similar action by the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1940's and 
the Communist Party in the Soviet Union.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 26 SAPA -- The South African 
Defence Force [SADF] has denied reports that additional troops 
have been deployed in the East Rand townships of Thokoza, 
Katlehong and Vosloorus to replace the police's Internal 
Stability Division [ISD], reports SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news. 
  This follows a claim by Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Regional 
Organiser Thabani Dlamini on Wednesday that more soldiers had 
been deployed in the violence-torn areas in spite of IFP 
objections. Mr Dlamini said soldiers had blocked the only 
access routes to hostels and people had been prevented from 
going to work. 
  SADF spokesman Maj Christo Visser confirmed that troops in 
Katlehong had blockaded some routes on Wednesday to better 
control the movement of weapons. This had been done after 
discussions with the IFP and the African National Congress 
[ANC], he said. The SADF had also agreed to build another road 
for hostel dwellers, he said, but was unsure about its progress. 
  Mr Dlamini claimed the ISD had proved an obstacle to the 
seizure of power by ANC self-defence units on the East Rand. 
  He claimed SADF troops openly sided with the ANC and that 
the 
decision by the Transitional Executive Council to replace the 
ISD with soldiers confirmed the IFP's suspicion that the council 
existed merely to rubber-stamp ANC demands. 
  In reaction, Maj Visser said the SADF was in the townships 
to 
help police stabilise the area. "The South African army 
distances itself from any political party and is there to serve 
the community as a whole. In our actions the SADF is 
apolitical, neutral and fair." 
  He said claims of assault and harassment were sometimes made 
to discredit the defence force.

<F P=106> [Report by Johannesb Ngcobo] </F>
  [Text] The SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF], SA 
Police [SAP] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and ANC [African 
National Party] have agreed that SADF troops will guard refugees 
returning to their East Rand homes. The decision was taken at a 
meeting attended by the ANC, Inkatha and the SADF's 41 Battalion 
last Friday, said SADF Witwatersrand spokesman Maj. Christo 
Visser. 
  The battalion had agreed to provide security for people 
returning to homes vacated during violence in Katlehong and 
Thokoza. Visser said the SADF had made the undertaking because 
it wanted to help the SAP restore normality in the townships by 
ending violence. "The SADF has deployed other troops in 
Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus because the ones that were 
stationed in these areas have been taken into the national 
peacekeeping force." 
  Visser said the army was in the townships to provide 
security 
and not to take part in the politics of the area. He said the 
troops had agreed to assist people returning to clean their 
homes before reoccupying them. 
  ANC East Rand subregional secretary-general Xeba Soyaya 
confirmed that a meeting between Inkatha and the SADF had taken 
place last Friday and said members of the army had agreed to 
guard the refugees when they cleaned their homes this weekend. 
He said that after the announcement of the peace plan being 
worked out between President F.W. de Klerk and ANC president 
Nelson Mandela, the ANC would call a series of rallies to 
welcome troops "and introduce them to the people." 
  An Inkatha official in Thokoza, Abram Mzizi, said he 
attended 
the meeting but as a parent, not an Inkatha member. He 
confirmed that army members had agreed to provide security in 
the area. He said this exercise was to last two weeks, after 
which a meeting would be called to review progress. If the need 
still existed, the army would continue providing security. 
  However, the Inkatha East Rand region accused SADF members 
of 
harassing its members in Katlehong and Thokoza. Inkatha 
regional organiser Thabani Dlamini said 17 cases of assault and 
harassment had already been reported to the Thokoza police 
station. "SADF members blockaded the only access available to 
hostel residents in and out of Katlehong," said Dlamini. "This 
has contributed to hundreds of hostel dwellers, particularly 
shift workers, losing their jobs," he alleged. 
  Dlamini said Inkatha was astounded at the sudden deployment 
of SADF troops without East Rand residents being consulted. 
"The decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] to 
replace the internal stability unit with SADF troops despite our 
known objections confirms once again widely held suspicions that 
the TEC is an instrument set up to rubber-stamp ANC demands." 
  Visser said the SADF "distances itself from any political 
party and is there to serve the community as a whole." To 
stabilise the area and keep fighting factions apart, the support 
of the whole community was needed. Any person assaulted or 
harassed was free to report this to the police. 
  SAPA reports that Visser confirmed that troops in Katlehong 
had blocked some routes yesterday to control the movement of 
weapons better but this had been done after discussions with 
Inkatha and the ANC. The SADF had also agreed to build another 
road for hostel dwellers, he said,but was unsure about its 
progress.

the problem and not the solution if their demands are not met. 
The president of the union, Mr. Dries Bruwer, said in a letter

attention should be given to such matters as the establishment 
of a volkstaat [homeland]. He said it was a small price to pay 
for peace in South Africa.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 26 SAPA -- A volkstaat [homeland] and 
self-determination were a small price to pay for peace in the 
country and if this demand was not granted farmers would not 
hesitate to resist, Transvaal Agricultural Union [TAU] President 
Dries Bruwer has said in a letter to African National Congress 
[ANC] National Chairman Thabo Mbeki. 
  In the letter, released to the press on Wednesday, he said: 
"The TAU stresses the fact that failure to accept these demands 
will result in farmers becoming part of South Africa's problem 
and not still part of the solution. If farmers are left no other 
choice they will not hesitate to resist with all means 
available." Mr Bruwer said it was in the interests of all that 
Mr Mbeki urgently attend to these facts to work out a peaceful 
solution. 
  Transvaal farmers had for years played an indispensable role 
in stabilising rural areas and it was an acknowledged fact the 
future existence of 60 percent of rural towns was dependent on 
the farming community, Mr Bruwer said. Farmers had been and 
still were committed to maintaining peaceful labour relations 
with the more than seven million black people who worked and 
lived on farms, he added. 
  The Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National 
Union]-affiliated TAU demanded that farmers' "reasonable 
demands" which included the recognition and establishment of a 
volkstaat with self-determination be accommodated. 
  Mr Bruwer said farmers and the ANC had come close to signing 
an agreement which would have provided for self-determination 
for Afrikaners in a volkstaat. The agreement, which also 
provided for blacks remaining in an Afrikaner volkstaat, had 
been scuttled as a result of the bogged-down trilateral Freedom 
Alliance/ANC/government talks. 
  Mr Bruwer said he enjoyed good relations with the ANC and 
liaised personally with Mr Mbeki.

  [Text] Johannesburg Jan 26 SAPA -- The Mineworkers Union 
[MWU] has recommitted itself to remaining a whites-only union, 
saying it believes white trade unionism is at the threshold of a 
huge revival. In a resolution passed at the end of the MWU's 
annual congress in Johannesburg on Wednesday, the union said it 
expected an increase in membership in reaction to affirmative 
action which would benefit blacks. 
  White miners would in future seek the protection of a white 
trade union as they would be unable to voice their aspirations 
through political channels. The congress regretted the 
break-down in talks between the Freedom Alliance, the government 
and the African National Congress, saying a golden opportunity 
for a permanent and peaceful political solution had been lost.

Party [CP] has never been inclined to negotiate with the actual 
or potential enemy of the nation over the nation's unnegotiable 
"own country" and "self-determination." 
  Despite this view, it had been important during the last 
three years to point out to the nation's enemy during 
"negotiations" what are in fact the CP's, and therefore the 
Afrikaner/Boer peoples', "unnegotiables." 
  The capitulating NP government has all along been secretly 
whispering to the leaders of the Afrikaner nation's enemy, 
saying the Afrikaners/Boers are just big cowards like the NP's 
leaders, and that there was no need to comply with the 
Afrikaner/Boer demands regarding unnegotiable land and 
self-determination. 
  For example, a prominent ANC [African National Congress] 
leader admitted to PATRIOT that the government's people "lied to 
them about the conservative Afrikaner's determination and 
ability" to assert themselves should their sovereign existence 
be threatened. 
  After the negotiations it became blatantly obvious that the 
enemy had no intention whatsoever of favorably looking -- before 
or after 27 April -- at any of the Afrikaner/Boer's 
self-determination ideals. 
  That is why CP leader Dr. Hartzenberg personally told Mr. 
Mandela what the Afrikaner people's unnegotiables were.

  [Excerpts] The group chief executive of the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation], Mr. Wynand Harmse, says 
private broadcasters may have to contribute to the 
corporations's funding in future. Addressing a conference on 
radio broadcasting in Johannesburg, he said the imminent 
deregulation of the industry would mean a loss of income for the 
SABC, as many new broadcasters would enter the advertising 
market. [passage omitted] 
  The chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters, 
Mr. 
Stan Katz, told the conference that the Independent Broadcast 
Authority would probably be established towards the end of 
March. He said permanent licenses for new broadcasters would be 
granted in about six to eight months from now. Mr. Katz said he 
did not believe that private broadcasters were needed before the 
April election to ensure adequate voter education and coverage 
of political events.

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 27 SAPA -- South Africa enjoyed the 
lowest inflation rate in 20 years during 1993, Central 
Statistical Services [CSC] in Pretoria reported on Thursday. The 
average inflation rate was 9.7 percent -- the lowest since 1973 
when it was 9.6 percent. Last year's rate was 4.2 percent lower 
than 13.9 percent in 1992. 
  The average annual rates of change in the CPI [Consuer Price 
Index] for the higher, middle and lower income groups were 10.2 
percent, 9.7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively. In 1992 these 
rates were 13.3 percent, 14.5 percent and 14.7 percent 
respectively. 
  The average food inflation rate of 6.8 percent for 1993 was 
18.6 percent lower than the corresponding rate of 25.3 percent 
for 1992. This rate is the lowest since 1971 (3.9 percent). 
  The price index for housing showed a negative inflation rate 
of -01 percent for 1993. This rate has shown a decreasing 
tendency since 1989 and is the lowest since 1959 when the index 
in this format was started, CSC said. 
  December's inflation rate was 9.5 percent -- 0.3 percent 
higher than November's 9.2 percent. Contributing to this 0.3 per 
cent increase were the decrease in the price index for housing 
(-0.2 percent) and increases in the price indices for food (0.2 
percent), transport (0.1 percent) and all other items (0.2 
percent). 
  December's food inflation rate was 5.2 percent -- 1.3 
percent 
higher than November's 3.9 percent. Against this, the annual 
increase in the price index for all items excluding food was 
10.7 percent, "which indicates that the change in food prices, 
notwithstanding the increase, still has a retarding effect on 
the inflation rate," CSS said. 
  The monthly increase of 1.1 per cent in the food price index 
was due to increases in the price indices for meat (2.8 
percent), fruit and nuts (5.5 percent), fish and other seafood 
(1.3 percent), coffee, tea and cocoa (0.8 percent) grain 
products (0.7 percent), fats and oils (0.4 percent) and sugar 
(0.3 percent). 
  "These increases were slightly counteracted by decreases in 
the price indices for vegetables (-3.5 percent) and milk, cheese 
and eggs (0.2 percent)," CSS said. 
  The monthly decrease in the housing index (-1.2 percent) was 
due to the decrease in interest rates on mortgage bonds. 
  The fuel price decrease of December 17 was not taken into 
account in the CPI for December. The direct effect of this would 
be reflected in the inflation rate for January. 
  In the urban areas, the highest inflation rate of 12.2 
percent for December was recorded in the OFS [Orange Free State] 
goldfields, while the lowest rate of 8.3 percent occurred in the 
Vaal Triangle. 
  The food price index for Pietermaritzburg showed the lowest 
annual increase of 3.3 percent, while the highest of 7.8 percent 
was shown in the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area. 
  The inflation rate for pensioners was 10.1 percent -- 0.6 
percent higher than december's official inflation rate. The 
lowest annual rate of increase was recorded in the Port 
Elizabeth/Uitenhage area, while the highest of 12.6 percent 
occurred in Bloemfontein. 
  Food prices at chain stores showed an annual increase of 5.3 
percent and a monthly increase of 1.0 percent, while those at 
the other retailers showed an annual increase of 4.3 percent and 
a monthly increase of 1.4 percent.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Communist Threat Tactics Will Not Get Support for NP -- 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 January in its page 6 
editorial comments on the 27 South African Communist Party 
(SACP) members placed among the top 50 positions of the African 
National Congress' (ANC) election candidates' list. The 
National Party (NP) "complains that 'the strategically strong 
position into which the SACP has manoeuvred itself spells danger 
to the whole process of establishing a true democracy with a 
strong and growing economy'. That may be so, but Red gevaar 
[threat] tactics will not swing Black votes to the NP -- and we 
doubt whether it will swing any other votes to it either. We 
will have to accept, like it or not, that the Reds who were 
under our beds in the days of the total onslaught are now on top 
of the beds." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  ANC `Deserves' Chance To Govern; DP Has Watchdog Role -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 January in a page 18 
editorial states: "We recognise that the African National 
Congress has earned its place as the majority party in a 
government of national unity." "Whether or not one agrees with 
the tactics the organisation employed over the years, The Star 
believes the ANC under Nelson Mandela deserves its chance to 
govern. Thereafter it should be judged according to its 
performance in government, and be retained or removed by the 
electorate." The paper believes the "presence in government of 
small but talented and principled parties such as the Democratic 
Party [DP], as well as individuals from the National Party, 
Inkatha Freedom Party, Pan-Africanist Congress and others, is 
very much in the long-term interests of the country, and the ANC 
itself." Although the DP is "much too white, too upper- class 
and too unrepresentative" its presence in the government of 
national unity "will be invaluable." It will "play a watchdog 
role, help entrench a workable multiparty system, and defend the 
core principles to which it and its predecessors have been 
committed. Bear in mind, too, that proportional representation 
means every vote counts: the DP is not going to win the 
election, but every vote it receives will contribute towards its 
presence in parliament." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  ANC's `Totalitarian' Style -- "The ANC is not yet the 
government, but already it shows a totalitarian-style inability 
to distinguish between its own narrow party interests and the 
national interest," points out a page 6 editorial in 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 27 January. That is the 
BUSINESS DAY's explanation for the ANC's "request that it be 
permitted to purchase a building, presumably with a foreign 
donation, through the financial rand. It has also asked that 
duties be waived for the importing of motor vehicles, office 
equipment and T-shirts, all designed to assist the ANC's 
election campaign." The request was "cynically" framed in terms 
of the "'leveling of the political playing field'," and has gone 
to the finance subcouncil of the Transitional Executive Council 
for adjudication "where, it so happens, the ANC and it allies 
are well-represented." If the ANC "were as committed to 
'transparency' as it claims to be, it would ensure that the 
subcouncil discussion on its request was open to the public. We 
hope the episode is not a preview of the open, honest government 
we can expect after the election." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  Government Urged To Avoid Lesotho Crisis -- "The South 
African government is wise to act with circumspection in the 
Lesotho crisis, and should do everything possible to avoid 
becoming involved, even if the government of the tiny mountain 
kingdom has asked that SA troops be sent to quell the fighting 
between rival army factions in Maseru," advises a page 8 
editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 25 January. 
"Pretoria, which has done well in mending its fences with 
Africa since February, 1990, does not wish to be suspected of 
reverting to a spoiling role in a neighbour-state."

program] 
  [Text] In an exclusive interview he granted ANGOP at 
Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace yesterday, President of the 
Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos said that UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has had a very balanced 
approach to the Angolan peace talks. The Angolan head of state 
noted that, first and foremost, Blondin Beye has known how to 
abide by Angolan law, adding that he has tried to have the 
warring sides reach whatever understandings they possibly can. 
  Asked whether he thinks today that the National Union for 
the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] had planned all along to 
launch a war in the event that it lost the September 1992 
elections, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos replied that it is 
possible that UNITA already had alternate plans, like all the 
forces -- especially the more backward forces -- that have 
assisted him during the conflict.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Angolan President Jose Eduardo </F>
dos Santos by unidentified ANGOP reporters in Luanda on 25 
January; on the "Opinion" section of the "Voice of Resistance of 
the Black Cockerel" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the 
government team to the Lusaka peace talks regularly gets in 
touch with you for consultation. Can one talk about progress at 
the talks? 
  [Dos Santos] No, I am not just consulted in this process 
where a negotiated settlement to the conflict is sought. In my 
capacity as president of the Republic and commander in chief of 
the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, I have a rather important 
interventionist role to play. So I have intervened in the 
process since its preparation stage. I have intervened in the 
assessment of strategies and tactics. My intervention has also 
had to do with the details of negotiation (?in Lusaka), the 
observers, and so forth. So my intervention is rather 
extensive. It could not have been otherwise (?if we are to end) 
the war, which today affects all our lives. I believe there is 
a solution. It may not happen as quickly as all Angolans of 
good faith would wish, but UNITA has no other option than to 
follow the path of reason now or some time from now. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President: At this stage, one can see that 
the government is making efforts aimed at creating social 
stability in government-controlled areas, particularly to help 
resolve problems linked to the increasing cost of living. Mr. 
President: How do you think the inflation rate can be brought 
under control, and how can the country's productive sector be 
reactivated? 
  [Dos Santos] Well, the government is studying the difficult 
economic situation facing our country today. Those studies are 
intended to help correct the macroeconomic imbalances that 
emerged principally over the course of the last year. It is my 
belief that, for as long as there is war, it will be very 
difficult -- perhaps even impossible -- to satisfactorily 
implement any government economic program aimed at a structural 
readjustment that will correct those macroeconomic imbalances. 
Basically, the circumstances [words indistinct] Angola's 
conditions. (?There is a major war on). There is no movement 
of people or goods. There is no transportation. There is 
consumption [words indistinct] the armed forces. On the other 
hand, there has been an increase in public spending and in the 
General State Budget deficit. There is no...[pauses] perhaps 
there is, but it will be extremely difficult to raise the fiscal 
(?revenue and implement) a war tax or some other tax that will 
help satisfy the needs prompted by war. In view of that, I 
think that every measure we take will inevitably be a palliative 
one lacking depth. 
  Obviously, [words indistinct] discussions by some of our 
economists [words indistinct] basically, in a symposium, where, 
I think, the great novelty was the proposal that a tax should be 
introduced [words indistinct] and so forth. In our opinion, 
though, we must first make a major effort to create areas of 
relative political and military stability. Fundamentally [words 
indistinct] relatively stable area where economic relations can 
take place. If we manage that, then perhaps we will be able to 
carry out a program to reduce the macroeconomic imbalances we 
are experiencing today and to control inflation to a certain 
extent. The government is making some studies, and I believe 
that those studies aim precisely at creating those areas of 
relative stability by means of a military effort and then by 
achieving complete peace through a negotiated settlement. 
Whether it be the one or the other, we would then proceed to 
implement whatever economic programs we could to correct those 
macroeconomic imbalances. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President: Angola has already felt the 
effects of having joined the IMF. A report has come out saying 
that the IMF recently reprimanded the Angolan Government. I 
would like to ask: How have relations been between the Angolan 
Government and the IMF? 
  [Dos Santos] There is constant dialogue between the 
government and the IMF and between the government and the World 
Bank. There are technical assistance programs under way, 
notably in the areas of finance, the Central Bank, planning, and 
so on. Obviously, there have been some differences. We are a 
sovereign state. We had planned an economic recovery of some 
three to four years, and those measures (?were) being discussed 
with the IMF. We also started negotiating with the Paris Club 
to have our foreign debt rescheduled, but then the situation in 
Angola changed completely.

  [Text] Reorganization of the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, is 
under way in Angola. Generals who were working in the FAA 
General Staff have now been called to the Defense Ministry in a 
bid to strengthen the effectiveness of the military [word 
indistinct] and put an end to many acts of indiscipline that 
have been affecting the combat morale of the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] government's army. Gustavo 
Costa reports from Luanda: 
  [Begin Costa recording] The recent transfer to the Defense 
Ministry of some generals who were only connected with the FAA 
General Staff appears to be the first indication that 
administrative, organizational, and logistical control is being 
restored over the structure that had until now been decoratively 
[decorativamente] led by [Defense Minister] Pedro Maria Tonha 
"Pedale", allowing the most complete freedom and autonomy to 
General Joao de Matos, FAA chief of General Staff. According to 
an authorized military source, this is ultimately an attempt to 
restore power and authority to the Defense Ministry, which will 
now also include generals who had previously served under the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The 
Defense Ministry could now play a more interventionist role in 
the definition of the major policies to resolve Angola's 
political and military problems, as well as to organize the 
government forces. 
  Some observers believe that the powers of intervention the 
Defense Ministry will now enjoy, strengthened by the approval of 
its new organizational statutes, is the result of a process of 
limiting the FAA General Staff's present powers. According to 
independent military sources, the FAA General Staff's methods 
have been questioned both by the military and by the very 
leadership of the ruling MPLA Party. In view of that, it has 
come as no surprise that influential generals have been moved. 
They had until then been directly connected with the FAA 
General Staff's higher logistical structures, today blamed for 
the ostentatious behavior of some officers. In contrast, the 
defense sector has always done poorly on the operational front. 
  UNITA President Jonas Savimbi views the FAA's logistics 
sector, which consumes enormous slices of the budget and foreign 
exchange cakes, as one of UNITA's principal allies. The alleged 
favoring of commercial transactions with enterprises of doubtful 
standing supposed to supply various merchandise to the FAA 
forces, could also be at the root of the criticism that FAA 
General Staff's Logistics Department has often come under. Some 
of that department's members and officials are accused of 
covering up what in Angola is called the vicious cycle of 
planned losses. That cycle appears to have its rotations 
numbered, though. 
  According to a senior Defense Ministry officer, uncontrolled 
spending by the FAA General Staff must now be rigorously 
accounted for. That source added that, for a start, money 
mobility has been curtailed and, in future, FAA management will 
be under the control of the Defense Ministry and will have to 
abide by its budget restrictions. 
  Just as a decree could be approved to stem rampant disorder 
and indiscipline in public enterprises and state organs, so the 
FAA forces and the forces of internal order could henceforth 
have to openly or privately acquire merchandise by means of 
public bids. That will depend on whether the value of the 
merchandise exceeds 100 or 500 million new kwanzas, which at the 
current foreign exchange rates corresponds to $1,000 and 5,000, 
respectively. [end recording]

  [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos, chairman of the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT], 
yesterday showed clearly that he is the main obstacle in the 
advancement of the Lusaka talks. Dos Santos even declared that 
he dictates laws to his negotiators in Lusaka from the time 
these laws are in the Ministry of State Security laboratories 
until their implementation at the negotiating table. 
International mediators are not immune either. In an interview 
with the ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY he said: 
  [Begin dos Santos recording] In my capacity as president of 
the Republic and commander in chief of the Angolan Armed Forces, 
FAA, I have a rather important interventionist role to play. 
So, I have intervened in the process since its preparation 
stage. I have intervened in the assessment of strategies and 
tactics, and my intervention has also had to do with the details 
of negotiations in Lusaka, the observers, and so forth. So my 
intervention is rather extensive. [end recording] 
  Eduardo dos Santos is still advocating a military solution 
for the Angolan conflict, urging his troops to be ready to fight 
once more. The MPLA-PT chairman, however, said his government 
is unable to solve the critical economic problems faced by 
Angola. 
  [Begin dos Santos recording] Poverty is a problem. 
Obviously, the state does not have the necessary conditions to 
deal with the fundamental problems of food, medical assistance, 
education, and so on. I believe all adopted measures were 
palliative. [end recording] 
  The Luanda government is unable to solve the basic problems 
of the Angolan people, particularly regarding food aid. It is 
the Futungo leading class, however, that benefits most from the 
war--in which it is bent on investing all Angolan funds [word 
indistinct] because it gets profits from the purchase of weapons. 
  Questioned about corruption in his government, with three 
ministers at the top of the list, Eduardo dos Santos did not 
deny or acknowledge the fact, but he admitted that there is 
corruption in the party and government he leads without, 
however, having discussed the issue in the MPLA-PT Central 
Committee meetings. 
  [Begin dos Santos recording] We do not deny or confirm this. 
These issues were not discussed in the Central Committee 
meeting (?I presided at). I believe there is generalized 
corruption in the current government and the party that won 
elections. [end recording] 
  Eduardo dos Santos neither knows nor ignores the anachronic 
corruption in the leading class of his organization but knows 
that it exists. The case has never been mentioned in the 
meetings of the regime's high hierarchy. Here is the main cause 
for the prolonged suffering of the Angolan people.

  [Text] Violent clashes continue to be waged in Bengo 
Province, where for several days troops from the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT], led 
by Eduardo dos Santos, have been on the offensive. According to 
correspondent Octavio Mulandi, very fierce clashes have taken 
place over the past 48 hours, with the aggressors suffering 
heavy losses. Mulandi said more clashes are expected in the 
coming days, taking into account yesterday's warmongering speech 
by the Futungo de Belas chief in an interview with the ANGOLAN 
PRESS AGENCY. Eduardo dos Santos promised to recover 
strategically important regions in his struggle against the 
Angolan people. 
  This morning, the MPLA-PT air force once again bombed 
agricultural fields and villages at Picapo, the correspondent 
said. Meanwhile, the UNITA Armed Forces are ready to prove to 
Eduardo dos Santos that it is foolish to mount offensives when 
parties are negotiating peace. This was stated by a UNITA 
captain interviewed on the front line in Bengo today.

  [Text] The Governments of Botswana, South Africa, and 
Zimbabwe have set up a task force to assess the situation of 
rival factional fighting within the Royal Lesotho Defense Force. 
The decision was reached during a one-day meeting attended by 
presidents Sir Ketumile Masire, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, F.W. 
de Klerk of South Africa, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and 
Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Selometsi Boholo, at the 
president's office today. 
  Addressing a news conference after the meeting, President 
Mugabe, who is the chairman of the Frontline States, said the 
task force will meet in South Africa tomorrow to discuss the 
modalities of their work. Mr. Mugabe explained that the task 
force, consisting of representatives of Governments of Botswana, 
South Africa, and Zimbabwe will work out the possibility of a 
program of action to be taken by the three countries. He 
declined to discuss the composition of the task force but 
stressed that it was to assess the situation in Lesotho, which 
may mean the task force could visit Lesotho as it will be based 
in South Africa. 
  Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Mr. Boholo, briefed the 
three heads of state and Mr. Mandela about the situation in 
Lesotho. President Mugabe described the situation in Lesotho as 
a disturbance that threatened the democratic process in that 
country. President Mugabe said Lesotho's prime minister, Dr. 
Ntsu Mokhehle, had asked the secretary general of the 
Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, to approach the Frontline 
States to assist in resolving the crisis. He said Chief Anyaoku 
approached him as the chairman of the Frontline States about the 
matter, and he in turn approached President Masire as SADC 
[Southern African Development Community] chairman, and the two 
invited the two South African leaders.

troubles in Lesotho's Army. Clashes between opposing factions 
have been going on in Maseru for almost two weeks, since one 
section demanded a big pay increase, but there are those who 
think it might have been an incipient plot against the 
government of Ntsu Mokhehle. The leaders decided to set up a 
task force to look into actions such as sending a detachment of 
peace-keeping troops to Lesotho, but the Lesotho opposition BNP 
[Basotho National Party] has been quick to issue a statement 
objecting. On the line to Maseru, Robin White asked the BNP 
leader, Evaristus Sekhonyana, what messages they will be sending 
to Botswana and Zimbabwe. 
  [Begin recording] [Sekhonyana] We have said very, very 
clearly: We may not have the power to stop those who want to 
intervene in the country. We have said it, but we have said 
that, were they to be tempted with this intervention, they 
honestly would be doing so against a unified political 
impression of the entire nation. This is our bidding. We have 
equally said that there are actions....[pauses] You know, this 
nation--unfortunately--may be small, but it is a nation of very 
proud people. They have not exhausted their local remedies, and 
we have said that, you know, the action of intervening at this 
stage before the local remedies have been exhausted will be 
considered by Basotho, the sovereign Lesotho, as a naked 
interference--and in fact a very strong word we are using--as a 
rape against our nationhood, a desecration of our constitution 
and its highest institutions, and a contempt upon his majesty. 
  [White] But isn't it pretty obvious that local solutions 
have 
failed? 
  [Sekhonyana] No. Only today, the secretary general of the 
Commonwealth is starting his initiative, and we just don't 
understand how the secretary general of the Commonwealth can 
begin his initiative today. The heads of churches, the 
political leaders, the nongovernmental organizations have all 
been united today in saying that local remedies have not been 
exhausted. And only today, the Commonwealth secretary general 
started this initiative. And somehow, in another capital, a 
decision has been taken to intervene militarily. We humbly 
request they rethink. 
  [White] If they were to come, what would you and your 
supporters do? 
  [Sekhonyana] There is nothing. What do you do against a 
military intervention? But all I am sure is that Basotho will 
not welcome it. That is one thing I am sure of. It may help 
the government if the government feels that it is going to be a 
helpful solution, but it is definitely not to become a welcome 
mission by Basotho. 
  [White] Mr. Sekhonyana, inspite of your denials, the feeling 
persisted in some way these soldiers who are rebelling are 
supporters of your party. 
  [Sekhonyana] Well, I really do not know, because, you know, 
this was concocted by the government and it is utter rubbish. 
  [White] I know you say it has got nothing to do with you, 
but 
what is your message to these rebel soldiers? 
  [Sekhonyana] The message we are making is that we are 
pleading with both sides in the Army. We are pleading. We join 
our comrades in other parties. We join the churches. We join 
the nongovernmental organizations. Today, the wives of the 
soldiers made a pleading: For heaven's sake, why do you play 
into the hands of those who have got bad designs on you? For 
heaven's sake stop fighting, lay down your arms, go under the 
structured command. This is the plea. This is the request of 
us in the entire nation. [end recording]

  [Text] The minister of foreign affairs, the honorable 
Molapo Qhobela, has refuted reports broadcast by the foreign 
media that a task force has been set up in the country to look 
into, as well to settle, the Army [word indistinct]. 
  Briefing the Royal Lesotho Defense Force members based at 
(Ha 
Rakamose) today, Mr. Qhobela said there is no such task force 
and there will never be. He indicated that it is only the 
Commonwealth special envoys who are here to help the government 
in quelling the situation. Mr. Qhobela said the government was 
not hiding a thing and believes in transparency to avoid 
conflicts, like the one in Lesotho that has resulted in factions 
within the Army. 
  He reiterated that the Army belongs to the nation and no 
individual church or political leader can own it. Mr. Qhobela 
briefed the soldiers about meetings held by the envoys with 
members of the diplomatic corps, the churches and political 
leaders which he said were very fruitful. The Commonwealth 
envoys, after their meeting with soldiers at (Ha Rakamose), will 
then hold a similar meeting with soldiers based at Makoanyane 
after lunch.

  [Text] The Commonwealth special envoys to Lesotho say they 
are impressed with the commitment projected by Lesotho political 
and church leaders in assisting the government to find a 
solution to the present army fracas. The two Commonwealth 
delegates who arrived in the country to try and assist the 
government in quelling the situation, Dr. Moses Anafu and Mr. 
Max Gaylard, told the media that there was unanimous support 
from the political leaders to help in the ending of the 
hostilities. However, Mr. Gaylard did not rule out the fact 
that there was still a danger that further fighting might break 
out. As to what the Commonwealth would do if the situation 
worsened, resulting in the toppling of the government by force, 
Dr. Anafu said the Commonwealth would not hesitate to take harsh 
measures. They expressed optimism that their discussions with 
representatives of the two warring army factions would be 
fruitful and end the crisis.

  [Text] Maseru Jan 26 SAPA--Thousands of protesters marched 
through Maseru's main street on Thursday [as received] to 
present a petition to Prime Minister Dr Ntsu Mokhehle on 
Lesotho's political crisis. The peaceful march was organised by 
the Lesotho Council of Non-governmental Organisations whose 
executive director, Caleb Sello, handed the petition to the 
Office of the Minister. 
  The petition stated: "That the prime minister should enlist 
the support of the cabinet, parliament and leaders of various 
political parties in the country to declare a general amnesty, 
which would serve as pardon for all sections of the warrings 
factions of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force." 
  A delegation from the Commonwealth of Nations Secretariat in 
London is visiting Lesotho on the instruction of Secretary 
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku to assess events in the Mountain 
Kingdom. The delegation is led by Maxwell Gaylard of Australia 
and Moses Anafu of Ghana, both diplomats at the Commonwealth 
Secretariat. 
  The Commonwealth team on Tuesday met Dr Mokhehle and Foreign 
Minister Molapo Qhobela and on Wednesday members of the 
diplomatic corps, Basotho church leaders and political leaders. 
  They are due to meet the officer commanding the Lesotho army 
and his military assistants on Thursday afternoon.

honorable minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Molapo Qhobela, says, 
we quote: We have been following closely the news concerning 
serious aggravation of the situation in the Kingdom of Lesotho. 
Armed clashes are taking place there in which military 
personnel is actively involved. The impression is created that 
the instigators of the disturbances are trying to exploit

unresolved socioeconomic problems to overthrow the legitimate

with the development of events in this country, with which we 
have long-standing friendly relations, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of Russia calls upon the parties to the conflict in 
Lesotho to put an end to the bloodshed, proceed to a peaceful 
settlement of their disagreement within the framework of a 
political dialogue in the interest of the people of Lesotho, 
peace and stability in the whole region of southern Africa, and 
its further democratic development. End of quote.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Britain's minister of overseas development, Baroness 
Chalker, is off to Malawi tonight after her last visit for some 
time, and things have changed. Under international pressure, 
President Banda has allowed multipartyism. Elections are coming 
up, and Malawi will be looking for moral and material 
encouragement from Britain. But her visit also coincides with 
skeletons jangling in Malawi's cupboards. There is a chorus of 
demands for an independent inquiry into the death of three 
ministers and an MP 10 years ago. The government insisted it 
was a car accident. Now, there are allegations of 
assassination. Ajoa Yeboa Afari asked Baroness Chalker what 
message she would be taking to Malawi. 
  [Begin recording] [Chalker] Well, I should be asking 
questions about their process of change, because I want to be 
sure that they are following the path of good government, 
respect for human rights, and the rule of law and that they are 
continuing with their economic reform program. And we shall 
actually talk about the elections, which we hope will be free 
and fair. If those things are going in the right direction, 
then I should be able to discuss further aid with the Government 
of Malawi. But such aid will only take place, of course, after 
the election. 
  [Afari] Since this is your first visit since 1987, does this 
indicate a change in the British attitude toward Malawi? 
  [Chalker] I think that what has happened is that with the 
referendum in Malawi, we have seen a change for the better by 
their government. I have wanted to go back to Malawi, but it 
was not yet given the right signal to go before that change had 
taken place. I am extremely happy that a change has taken place 
and that I can now go and have what I know will be fruitful 
discussions, not only with the president and his ministers, but 
also with members of the opposition. 
  [Afari] Talking about the right signals, I believe you are 
aware that just recently a policeman is alleged to have 
confessed to having taken part in the murder of some politicians 
a decade ago, apparently on government instructions. What would 
you say to people who would see your visit as a kind of boost 
for the government at this very controversial time? 
  [Chalker] Well, first of all, I think you will understand, I 
cannot comment on an internal Malawian matter. There is recent 
progress on human rights in Malawi, but I shall be urging the 
Government of Malawi that that progress on human rights and the 
proper policing of the country should be continued. But I 
cannot comment on individual matters. 
  [Afari] Baroness, I appreciate that. But I think since you 
are also insisting on good governance, perhaps your support 
otherwise might send some signals to other countries. 
  [Chalker] Well, I am consistent to the last on this, and I 
will not allow our aid program to be used where government is 
not in the best interests of the people. 
  [Afari] Baroness, would you then lend your support to a call 
for a campaign in Malawi for an independent inquiry into the 
atrocities? 
  [Chalker] I cannot comment on that publicly. I do not have 
the details. Certainly, the people of Malawi deserve open, 
honest government, and I should do all I can to encourage the 
Government of Malawi to make sure they do have open, honest 
government. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with Jose de Castro, Renamo Foreign </F>
Affairs Department chief and head of the Renamo team to the 
National Elections Commission, and Transport and Communications 
Minister Armando Guebuza by BBC correspondent Leonel Matias on 
the "London Last Minute" program -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] In Mozambique, Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] leader, has threatened that if the 
international community does not honor its pledges to finance 
his organization, he will not participate in the country's first 
multiparty elections scheduled for October of this year. In an 
interview published in the first edition of the independent 
SAVANA newspaper, the Renamo leader did, however, say that 
Renamo does not intend a return to war. Leonel Matias, our 
correspondent in Maputo, reports: 
  In an interview he granted to the BBC, Jose de Castro, 
Renamo's number-one man for electoral matters, noted that his 
movement had received promises of financing for its 
transformation into a political party, as long as it signed the 
General Peace Accord. Jose de Castro says that the accord was 
signed, but those countries have not complied with their 
undertakings yet. 
  [Begin Castro recording] We find ourselves in a precarious 
situation that does not allow us to be at peace to face up to 
the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo. In view of that, we 
believe such support would be necessary, seeing that it has been 
promised. If you promise, you owe. [end recording] 
  I also asked Jose de Castro how much money Renamo thinks the 
international community should make available. He did not 
provide figures, but said that Renamo needs a great deal of 
money. 
  [Begin Castro recording] At this stage, we have delegates 
working from their own homes. They do not have [words 
indistinct] residences. It is important to note that those are 
key provinces, notably those where we believe some conditions 
should have been in place but are not. [end recording] 
  It should be noted that the United Nations has already 
created a special fund for Renamo. That fund is worth $6 
million. I asked Jose de Castro whether that amount would not 
be enough: 
  [Begin Castro recording] We need transportation. We need 
homes. We need fax machines. We need machines. In other 
words, we need so many things that we see $6 million as less 
than a drop in the ocean. [end recording] 
  Reports doing the rounds in the Mozambican capital today say 
that EC countries have decided to support the special fund that 
has been created for Renamo. However, no details are available 
at this stage. 
  Reacting this afternoon to the statement made by the Renamo 
leader, Transport and Communications Minister Armando Guebuza, 
government representative in the Supervision and Control 
Commission, described Afonso Dhlakama's threats as blackmail. 
  [Begin recording] [Guebuza] I hope that the Renamo leader 
will reconsider that demand, because it cannot be used to 
blackmail our people. 
  [Matias] Do you see it as blackmail? 
  [Guebuza] I cannot see any better explanation for it. Our 
people want money but they know they will only have it once 
there is stability in the country. [end recording]

  [Text] Over 1,200 Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] 
troops, gathered at the United Nations-run assembly point at 
Muhia, in Mozambique's central province of Zambezia, have 
demanded that UN special representative in the country Aldo 
Ajello provide them with better conditions. Ajello visited 
Muhia yesterday, accompanied by the Mozambican peace negotiator 
in the peace process with Renamo, Armando Guebuza, Renamo's 
Foreign Affairs Secretary Jose de Castro, and several Western 
diplomats. 
  Renamo fighters at Muhia complained to journalists about 
their food and housing. They claimed that insufficient food had 
been sent, and they were fed up with the monotony of a diet 
consisting essentially of maize and beans. The UN Operation in 
Mozambique denies that there is any food shortage in any of 35 
assembly points currently opened. 
  The food is supplied by the World Food Program [WFP], and 
the 
daily portion of the Mozambican soldier is higher than in any 
other WFP operation anywhere in the world. 
  Mr. Ajello has been visiting the assembly points to see with 
his own eyes the real situation in those accommodation areas.

<F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>
  [Excerpts] The ANC's [African National Congress] behavior 
following the invitation to the organization's president, Mr. 
Nelson Mandela, to visit Namibia during SWAPO [South-West 
African People's Organization] solidarity week, was insulting to 
say the least. President Sam Nujoma and SWAPO were insulted in 
the worst possible manner, and none of the thousands of 
explanations by SWAPO's public relations division is acceptable. 
Only a fanatical minority party support group still concern 
themselves with excuses from SWAPO headquarters. Namibians are 
not sorry that Mr. Mandela has dropped his plans to visit 
Namibian communities during a fund-raising attempt for the ANC's 
election campaign with SWAPO President Sam Nujoma and SWAPO 
Secretary General Moses Garoeb. Mr. Mandela unknowingly did 
Namibians a favor by canceling the visit. 
  First, his presence would only have secured an audience for 
Mr. Garoeb in Oranjemund, and, second, under the current 
economic and social conditions, Namibians can ill afford to make 
funds available to a party such as the ANC, which already has 
millions at its disposal. Namibians believe that Mr. Mandela is 
aware of the fact that inhabitants of this country need the 
money more than the ANC does, and for this reason he decided not 
to visit the country. 
  The motive for the cancellation could also be that Mr. 
Mandela has heard of SWAPO's three failed national fund-raising 
efforts and wanted to spare himself and SWAPO the disgrace. 
SWAPO's car competition in its newspaper, NAMIBIA TODAY, was 
canceled because of a lack of interest, while the newspaper 
eventually closed its doors for the same reason. For a while 
last year, it was propped up artificially with state funds and 
NEW ERA machinery. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday the ANC informed a South African news agency that 
Mr. Mandela's visit had been canceled, but a SWAPO spokesman 
Alfeus Naruseb reported that the visit would go ahead. It seems 
that SWAPO wanted to send a signal to Mr. Mandela that he should 
not cancel his visit before he has Mr. Naruseb's permission to 
do so. Mr. Nujoma explained yesterday that he was informed 
about the cancellation of the visit. According to him, Mr. 
Mandela telephoned him yesterday morning. But if Mr. Nujoma 
followed NBC [Namibian Broadcasting Corporation] news, he would 
have known that the South African news agency and the NBC knew a 
day before him that the visit had been canceled. This is a rude 
response from ANC ranks and an unequaled display of 
thanklessness. This insult comes after the organization 
received an amount of 1 million rand from the Namibian 
Government in the midst of the drought. It is an insult, to say 
the least. If SWAPO does not see it this way, then the party is 
more unobservant than expected.

  [Text] Harare Jan 26 SAPA--Officials from the ministries of 
Internal Affairs from South Africa and Zimbabwe met in Harare on 
Monday [24 January] to discuss a wide range of bilateral issues, 
including immigration formalities, ZIANA news agency reported on 
Wednesday. 
  After the meeting, the Zimbabwe Government said in a 
statement: "The deliberations were cordial and fruitful and 
issues included border arrangements at Beit Bridge, cross-border 
family visits and administrative procedures with regard to 
immigration formalities." 
  Both sides agreed to meet regularly in future to discuss 
matters of mutual concern. The Zimbabwean Government said the 
meeting was a follow-up to the one held in December between 
Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira and his South African 
counterpart Pik Botha at the border town of Messina. This 
meeting ended with pledges of increased economic cooperation 
between the two countries.

  [Excerpt] Meetings and consultations on finances continue 
at the prime minister's office. The topic on today's agenda was 
the reduction by half of the value of the CFA franc in the franc 
zone and its impact on the financial agreements between 
financial backers and countries that share the use of the CFA 
franc, which was devalued on 11 January. Our country Cote 
d'Ivoire, which is very concerned about solving the problems 
caused by this new economic situation, has been holding 
discussions led by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, in 
attempt to ensure the revamping of the Ivorian economy with the 
support of international financial institutions. 
  Late this morning, Prime Minister Duncan granted audience to 
an IMF delegation. The focus of the meeting was to sign the 
letter of intent concerning the Ivorian economic program 
endorsed by the IMF for the establishment of an enhanced 
three-year structural adjustment program worth 281 billion CFA 
francs. This program will enable the country to reach as early 
as 1996--that is within two years--a 6-percent growth rate with, 
in particular, the active resumption of investments to 
consolidate and strengthen public finances, and finally, the 
establishment of measures that will benefit the poorer 
categories of the society. 
  [Begin Duncan recording] The particularity of this program 
compared with previous ones is that it has been launched in the 
aftermath of the devaluation of the CFA franc which was decided 
by franc zone member countries. As a classic instrument of 
economic policy, the modification of the exchange rate has its 
constraints, the most important of them being the control of 
prices, the control of monetary creation, and the resorption of 
public deficit. The change in parity also brings about an 
improvement in competitiveness and should play a decisive role 
in the growth of our economy. Simultaneously, external aid will 
make it possible to finance important economic and social 
programs. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The loser in the power struggle following the death 
of President Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire], 
Alassane Ouattara, has been having rather a hard time of it. He 
lost out to Henri Konan Bedie. Mr. Ouattara came home at the 
weekend and since his return the government press has been 
hounding and denouncing him. Robin White asked our Abidjan 
correspondent, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, what the press was saying. 
  [Begin recording] [Quist-Arcton] Harsh words from the new 
director general of FRATERNITE MATIN. He asked whether Alassane 
Ouattara was trying to challenge the authority of the state, 
having accused him of being a threat to public order, and the 
sin or the crime of Mr. Ouattara seems to have been the fact 
that hundreds of his supporters and sympathizers tried to meet 
and greet him at the airport when he came back on Saturday [22 
January] after a three-week absence. But they were prevented 
from doing so because security forces were deployed in great 
number on the road to the airport and, actually, at the airport. 
  [White] What has Ouattara been doing since he got back? 
  [Quist-Arcton] He has been keeping very quiet. We drove to 
his house today to try and see him, and we were told that he was 
willing to take calls from journalists over the phone but 
wouldn't see us face to face. But whilst we were there we 
noticed that normally Ouattara has bodyguards, or at least 
military guards outside his house. All these seem to have 
disappeared and the person who was at the reception desk at the 
front seemed to be either a cook or somebody who worked in the 
house. He was wearing a very formal sort of white jacket. 
  [White] Exactly what has happened to his security? 
  [Quist-Arcton] That is difficult to say. His cousin, Mr. 
Abdoulaye Cisse, said that at about 1245 today the soldiers were 
withdrawn. They were given an order to withdraw and they 
withdrew, and that is all they know about what the authorities 
have done. But he said that they were setting up their own 
security and that the people in the locality, Blokosso, where 
Mr. Ouattara lives in Abidjan, had already sent about 10 young 
men to guard him and that they were trying to work out a team of 
about 25 altogether for his personal security. Mr. Ouattara 
hasn't made any formal comment on the withdrawal of his military 
security. 
  [White] But you guess that Konan Bedie would be pretty happy 
if Ouattara was to leave the country? 
  [Quist-Arcton] Well, I think people say that he feels that 
Ouattara is some sort of political competition because although 
he was brought in a sort of economist who was going to basically 
try and revive Ivory Coast's economy, he soon became a political 
animal and I think that the sort of old politicians, those who 
had waited their time for Houphouet to be out of the limelight, 
feel a bit bitter that this newcomer, or this upstart, or 
Burkinabe as they call him -- because a lot of his enemies say 
that he is not Ivorian at all -- feel that he has tried to 
(?muscle) his way into the political scene, and this is wrong.

<F P=106> ["Editorial" by Michel Kouame; passages within slantlines </F>
published in boldface] 
  [Text] How does one interpret what happened on 22 January 
in the airport area on the Port-Bouet-Koumassi road, and even at 
Cocody? A defiance of the authority of the state, or 
better still a foretaste of the "insurrection" which 
somebody may be planning to dish out to Ivorians after President 
Houphouet-Boigny's burial? Many are our countrymen who still 
wonder and anxiously await the end of the state burial which 
Cote d'Ivoire and the rest of the world are preparing for the 
deceased head of state. They wonder whether "February 
94" is not going to be a repeat of "February 
92," as though it were already predestined that the second 
month of the year will be for us like the month of May for 
France -- the month of all perils. Remember May 1968 in 
metropolitan France and May 1958 in Algiers.... among others. 
  If it was a defiance of state authority, then there is 
reason 
to ask a few questions. Who is steering the wheel? Who is 
behind what happened on 22 January? This question is pertinent 
because no one can prove that it was in a spontaneous fashion 
that these "supporters" of the former prime minister 
moved to the airport. Consistent reports talk of distribution of 
money throughout Abidjan and in the communes and the hiring of 
minibuses, "woro-woro," and "gbaka" [parallel taxi and minibus 
services, respectively], the idea being to prove, on the one 
hand, that the former prime minister's popularity has remained 
intact and, on the other, that the new head of state, whose 
assumption of office on 7 December 1993 was by virtue 
of Article 11 of the Constitution, does not in any way enjoy the 
trust of his countrymen. 
  The proponents of this thinking, who maintained from the 
onset that Article 11 was inapplicable and that it "would 
put the country to fire and sword as soon as Houphouet-Boigny's 
death is announced," have not yet lost hope of seeing their 
wish materialize -- i.e. setting the country ablaze, turning it 
definitely into another Liberia, for the simple reason that 
"power has eluded them," for the time being.... In 
short, they have lost "the battle," but have not yet "lost the 
war." Hence, the end justifies the means, not only in defying 
the authority of the new head of state but particularly in 
impressing upon all and sundry that without the former prime 
minister there can be no salvation for Ivorians, now at the 
mercy of the worst cataclysm. 
  We all remember the February 1992 attempt which was roundly 
condemned by all true patriots and men of good judgment from 
both the Right and the Left, and while the view held then by 
students and some opposition leaders that the swoop by the 
military on the Yopougon University hall of residence was 
"a causus belli," what are we to understand this 
time? That Cote d'Ivoire is wrong to have had institutions that 
function? That the Constitution of the Republic ought not to 
have been applied after President Houphouet-Boigny's death? 
That a military or civilian coup d'etat would have been far 
better that a constitutional provision which, even though 
admittedly imperfect, had the merit of existing? 
  Whatever the case may be, the strategic and tactical 
alliance formed between a section of the opposition -- 
which, only recently, held Alassane Ouattara up to public 
obloquy -- and friends of the former prime minister is a 
curious one. Together, they are committing the fatal 
error of consciously setting the stage for disorder through acts 
of provocation and defiance and by misinforming and poisoning 
the minds of the people. No one stands to gain from a 
disintegration of the country. No one has ever gained anything 
by destroying their own country. Savimbi and Charles Taylor can 
bear witness to that. This is why it is self-evident that just 
as the return fire to the "final onslaught" was 
"fatal," Cote d'Ivoire still has the means to deal 
with "rabble rousing" were it to resurface. The 
state must stand firm in the interest of the majority of 
Ivorians, who aspire to nothing but peace. 
  [Paris AFP in French in an Abidjan date-lined item at 1107 
GMT on 26 January adds the following: "These remarks were 
received with "surprise and regret" by Ouattara who, in a 
statement to AFP, maintained he had "nothing to do" with what 
happened and had "never done any act to disturb anything 
whatsoever," and called for serenity. He stated that for the 
time being he had made no decision regarding his future, 
political or otherwise. He also played down his differences 
with Mr. Bedie, saying he had "nothing against him." Mr. 
Ouattara further recalled that he had made no public statement 
since President Houphouet-Boigny's death on 7 December which led 
to his resignation two days later."]

  [Excerpts] The National Assembly is in emergency session 
since 24 January. The devaluation of the CFA franc has already 
been the subject matter of a communication by Prime Minister 
Mahamadou Issoufou. Yesterday, the minister of national 
education reported on the situation in the country's schools and 
colleges sector. This session is currently in progress, and we 
have Mohamed Ali on the spot reporting from the National 
Assembly. It seems the parliamentarians debated among others an 
item on discriminatory practices in various government 
departments. Here is Mohamed Ali. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] Unlike the calm 
atmosphere that marked the first two days of the session, 
business today was particularly turbulent. The calm was broken 
both inside and outside parliament. Indeed, two incidents which 
have as common denominator the criticism of policies of the 
Government of the Third Republic, occurred. First, outside 
parliament, university and other students arrived in small 
groups early this morning for a so-called peaceful demonstration 
to remind the parliamentarians that in spite of the national 
education minister's reassuring utterances yesterday, their 
financial problem remains unresolved. They hung on the main 
gate of the closed parliament house using loudspeakers to spit 
out insults at the government and the National Assembly, and 
thereby preventing parliamentarians from resuming business at 
the scheduled time -- that is at 0900. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  Now, concerning the university and other students you 
mentioned, they held a rally at which they protested the arrest 
of the secretary general of the Niger Students Union [USN] 
following a violent demonstration on 10 January during which 
students and security men clashed. This morning's demonstrators 
later embarked on a march which took them to the office of the 
prime minister. Security men had taken position at several road 
junctions and around the prime minister's office but they did 
not intervene. Furthermore, the demonstrators issued a 24-hour 
ultimatum to the government to release the USN secretary 
general. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The information minister, Professor Jerry Gana, 
says the Federal Government will announce how long it will stay 
in office when the national constitutional conference concludes 
its assignment. He said though the tenure is expected to be 
short, it will depend on the outcome of the conference. 
Reporter Obeijina Ogba has the details. 
  [Begin Ogba recording] Professor Gana, who led the National 
Orientation Agency's campaign team to Kano today, said it is 
only fair that such a timetable be based on decisions of the 
national constitutional conference. The government, he said, 
cannot go ahead to organize local governments, governorships, 
national assembly or presidential elections when Nigerians (have 
doubts regarding) the political framework of Nigeria. He added 
that the government will honor the decisions of the conference.

  [Text] Senegal and South Africa [RSA] have agreed to open 
representation bureaus in Pretoria and Dakar. These bureaus, 
which will become operational within a few days, will be mainly 
devoted to commercial, economic, and consular transactions. The 
Senegalese Government has appointed Amadou Kebe to head the 
bureau. He was previously first advisor at the Foreign Ministry 
and is currently director of the Africa-Asia Bureau of that 
ministry. For its part, the RSA Government has appointed Ms. 
(Wanda Wald) who will assume the same duties in Dakar. These 
bureaus will be upgraded to embassy level probably after the 
South African elections.

  [Text] The guest of Afrique Soir is Destin Arsene Tsati 
Boungou, legal adviser and spokesman for Congolese President 
Pascal Lissouba. The crisis is still going on in Congo. 
Negotiations do not really seem to be on the agenda, and the 
Army has once again blocked access to the opposition stronghold, 
i.e., the districts in the south of Brazzaville. The Army 
blocked these roads on 17 January. Monique Mas asked Destin 
Arsene Tsati Boungou to explain the strategy of the parties 
close to the presidency on this: 
  [Begin recording] [Boungou] Bacongo and Makelekele are today 
the stronghold of opposition militias. The issue is whether we 
should see to it that arms no longer reach these districts. It 
will then be up to the state to take some measures likely to 
minimize the risk, as it were, of arms being circulated in these 
districts. 
  [Mas] Minimize the risk through a blockade? Is a blockade 
likely to prevent the circulation of weapons? 
  [Boungou] No, not a blockade, but checking people entering 
or 
leaving Bacongo. For instance, an officer was recently 
kidnapped by opposition militias, and we have not heard anything 
about him to this day. But there are any number of similar 
cases in Brazzaville today. In such circumstances, a state 
cannot be idle. 
  [Mas] How do you explain the fact that the Congolese Army 
was 
not able to get the upper hand over the rebels, on one hand, and 
that it resorted to heavy weapons in districts where civilians 
live, on the other? 
  [Boungou] You should know that our army was inherited from 
the single-party regime. Repression was its vocation. There is 
no longer a police force as such, nor a gendarmerie. In today's 
context, when the ninjas, as they are called--i.e., the 
opposition militias, attack soldiers that are sent to these 
districts--what do you think they can do, apart from using the 
defense means at their disposal? Not that this is a method 
likely to make us move toward peace, I don't think so, but the 
fact that--as far as the urban guerrilla war developing in 
Brazzaville is concerned--we do not yet have security forces and 
gendarmes prepared for this type of operation has to be taken 
into account. We are working on this. 
  [Mas] Isn't the Army also affected by the division of the 
country? 
  [Boungou] On the whole, the Army is still committed to the 
desire later expressed by the National Conference to move toward 
democracy [sentence as heard]. But it goes without saying that 
it would be wrong to say that the Army is not also shaken by the 
ethnic and tribal-political upheavals the country is going 
through, since the Army moves in the same environment as 
everyone else. It is nevertheless a fact that on the whole, the 
Army is still committed to the democratic principle. 
  [Mas] At the end of the day, one is under the impression 
that 
political life in Congo is being reduced to a mere power 
struggle between, on one hand, an opposition that you are saying 
has militias, an opposition in which a former president plays a 
certain role, and, on the other hand, an elected president who 
chose a general as prime minister and who himself recruits what 
some call militias. 
  [Boungou] I think that you are misinformed. And if it is not 
the duty of a president and a prime minister, of a government, 
to set up forces able to see to the safety of the citizens, and 
to restructure and recruit them, I would like to know what a 
government can do. No. The issue is whether our people are 
aware of the situation, the rift in our national fabric. [end

  [Text] Brazzaville, 26 Jan (AFP)--Christophe Moukoueke, 
leader of the Presidential Group, an alliance of parties close 
to President Pascal Lissouba, today ruled out the group's 
participation in a national union government made up of "party 
representatives." However, his movement "is prepared to examine 
the possibility of forming a national union government with 
members selected on a regional basis," Mr. Moukoueke told AFP, 
stressing that this should be "done strictly in accordance with 
the Constitution." "If it is established that the formation of a 
national union government is the only solution to the current 
crisis and that Congolese killed each other in their search for 
this government simply because everyone would like to have a 
share of the cake, then we accept to examine the issue," he 
added. 
  On the other hand, Mr. Moukoueke said he "is totally opposed 
to a government consisting of political parties because people 
would seek to defend their party views." Prior to the eventual 
establishment of a national union government on a regional basis 
"a working document and a consensus program must first be 
devised," Mr. Moukoueke stated adding "I wonder why there is so 
much talk about this union government; it may not necessarily 
bring an end to the crisis." 
  President Lissouba had announced on 31 December 1993 that he 
was prepared to set up a national union government. The 
opposition had expressed support for the formation of this 
government, provided it was formed after the final verdict of 
the arbitration college, which is expected to rule before 5 
February on the 58 petitions for the annulment of the 1993 early 
legislative elections. The legislative elections constitute one 
of the factors leading to the bloody political clashes that have 
ravaged the southern districts of Brazzaville for several months 
now.

  [Text] Relations between Madrid and Malabo are once more in 
turmoil. Spain has decided to suspend all forms of aid to 
Equatorial Guinea effective immediately. Antonio Sibacha's 
exiled opposition Union for Democracy and Social Development is 
happy about this measure suspending aid to Malabo and urges 
donors, the United States, and the European countries to take a 
cue from Madrid as long as Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo's 
regime refuses to respect human rights and to democratize the 
country.

  [Text] Libreville, 26 Jan (AFP) -- The prices of essential 
commodities have increased these past days in Malabo, the 
capital of Equatorial Guinea, and Bata, the second largest city 
of the country, despite the freeze placed on goods by the 
government, Equatorial Guinean radio monitored in Libreville 
said today. 
  Some traders even hoarded some goods such as soap, cooking 
oil, rice, and milk in order to cause a shortage and to increase 
prices on the markets, the radio said, but did not give figures 
as examples of the price increase. 
  Equatorial Guinea, the last country to join the franc zone 
in 
1985, was until now free from all price increases brought about 
in the zone by the announcement of the devaluation of the CFA 
franc by 50 percent. 
  "The situation is unbearable in Malabo where traders have 
increased the prices of all their goods. People are now waiting 
in lines to buy a kilo of rice whose price has doubled," a 
Malabo inhabitant commented over the phone from Libreville. 
  This situation "is all the more serious because the 
devaluation occurs at a time when the purchasing power of the 
Equatorial Guineans is very low and the government has not yet 
even planned to increase salaries," he added. 
  The average salaries in Equatorial Guinea range from about 
CFA 25,000 to CFA 30,000.

  [Text] The cabinet met in Libreville yesterday. Important 
decisions were made including the need to preserve the 
purchasing power of the Gabonese people following price hikes 
after the devaluation of the CFA franc. The head of state, 
President El Hadj Omar Bongo, called on cabinet to take tough 
measures to implement the freeze on essential commodity prices, 
and called on the Ministry of Commerce to remain vigilant on the 
issue since prices change from one area of the city to the other. 
  The other important measure taken was the lifting of the ban 
on opposition leaders leaving Gabonese territory.

  [Text] Libreville, 27 Jan (AFP) -- Today's issue of the 
BUCHERONS, mouthpiece of the National Lumberjacks Rally [RNG], 
Gabon's leading opposition party, did not refer to the party's 
leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, as "president of the 
Republic." Father Abessole, who placed second in the 5 December 
presidential elections at which Mr. Bongo was reelected in the 
first round, had declared himself winner of the poll. He then 
formed a "High Council of the Republic" comprising the majority 
of the opposition candidates at the poll and a shadow 
"government" headed by a "prime minister," Pierre-Andre 
Kombilla-Koumba, first secretary of the RNG. 
  In its latest issue, the biweekly dropped these terms and 
reverted to the use of the former titles of "chairman" and 
"first secretary of the RNG." Already, on 22 January, after the 
Constitutional Court turned down the opposition's petition for a 
cancellation of the election results and following the swearing 
in of the head of state for another five-year term of office, 
the opposition decided to drop the terms "government" and 
"Republic" and to replace them with "cabinet" and "resistance," 
respectively. 
  Meeting under the banner of the Convention of Forces of 
Change, the opposition had urged the people "to gear up for 
democratic resistance." According to a source close to the 
"cabinet," who declined to give further details, the opposition 
"is considering a medium-term strategy" at the moment.

  [Text] Today morning, the notorious youthwingers of 
MRND-CDR [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development, and Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] 
numbering 50 and 100, backed by the gendarmes, staged violent 
demonstrations blocking the road from Kacyiru [Kigali outskirts] 
to the headquarters of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda] 
and committed acts of terror against both motorists and 
pedestrians. 
  It all started at around 0930 AM when armed youthwingers of 
MRND- CDR converged at 100 meters from CND [National Development 
Council] building where RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] officials 
reside, and erected barricades in the roads. The notorious 
supporters of MRND-CDR began to pull people out of cars, 
confiscated things, smashed windscreens, and forced the owners 
of vehicles to walk on foot. According to an eyewitness, one 
person was violently pulled out of the car and slashed with a 
panga [machete]. 
  The attackers accused the victims of being tall, and 
therefore a Tutsi, according to them. All these acts of terror 
took place in the presence of security forces, the local 
paramilitary gendarmes. The gendarmes seemed concerned with the 
security of the perpetrators of violence instead of 
administering law and order. The only vehicles allowed to pass 
were those of RTLM [expansion unknown], a radio station used by 
MRND-CDR, and that of Mr. [name indistinct] the secretary 
general of MRND-CDR party, which passed in the area several 
times. At around 1100 AM, the MRND-CDR gang stopped an RPF 
vehicle which was taking an RPA [Rwandan Patriotic Army] officer 
to the headquarters of UNAMIR to meet Brigadier General Romeo 
Dallaire [UNAMIR commander]. In order to pass, the RPA soldiers 
escorting the officer had to shoot in the air to disperse those 
manning the illegal roadblock. When the RPF vehicle returned 
from the headquarters of UNAMIR, it was again stopped by the 
MRND-CDR youth. When the RPA soldiers tried to pass they were 
shot at by the gendarmes who had led an ambush nearby. The RPA 
returned fire and they drove home. The gendarmes continued 
shooting and bullets hit the CND building in which the RPF 
officials reside. 
  Contrary to reports by Radio Kigali nobody was injured by 
the 
bullets during the exchange of fire. The only casualty reported 
was the person cut with a panga by the MRND-CDR youthwingers. 
According to UNAMIR regulations, demonstrations are supposed to 
take place 1.5 km away from the RPF residence. But the MRND-CDR 
activists have been staging their demonstration close to the RPF 
residence in order to provoke RPF soldiers guarding the place. 
Today's illegal roadblock was erected only 100 meters from the 
main entrance to the CND building. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Kigali say that the presidential 
guards and the gendarmes have started vacating their families 
from the area. The presidential guards are said to be spreading 
rumors that RPF soldiers are planning to do something tonight, 
which is something the presidential guards did not explain. 
Other members of presidential guards in civilian clothes are 
reported to have spent the day making reconnaissance around the 
RPF residence at CND. 
  Following President Habyarimana's move to block the setting 
up of the broad-based transitional institutions, there have been 
increasing acts of provocation by MRND-CDR activists and these 
are now being joined by the government forces, the gendarmes, 
and presidential guards.

  [Text] Kigali, Jan 26 (AFP) -- Former rebel guerrillas shot 
and wounded four demonstrators in Rwanda's capital Kigali on 
Wednesday [26 January] during a protest against the alleged 
killings of two civilians by the guerrillas, witnesses said. 
  The four protesters were wounded when about 15 fighters of 
the former rebel movement, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), 
fired into a crowd of protesters near their barracks, the 
witnesses said. 
  Rwandan authorities said they were investigating accusations 
that RPF fighters, many of whom are to join the army under peace 
accords signed with the government in August, had killed two 
people on Sunday night. Local residents said they wounded two 
others on Tuesday night. 
  After nearly three years of civil war, the RPF agreed in 
August to join a transitional coalition government which has 
still to be sworn in. Six hundred of its former fighters, 
mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, have been billetted in the 
capital to protect former RPF leaders who are to assume 
government posts. 
  But the already strained relations between the Tutsis, 
Rwanda's feudal rulers, and the majority Hutus have soured 
further since the RPF fighters arrived last month, political 
analysts said.

  [Text] The OAU secretary general, who arrived yesterday, is 
trying to secure an agreement on the deployment of African 
troops. Mr. Salim has four days to negotiate with political 
forces on the dispatching of about 200 OAU soldiers. 
  The deployment of the pan-African military mission was 
requested by the Burundi Government after the failure of the 
military coup attempt last October. The first elements of the 
OAU mission arrived last month but the force charged with the 
protection of the government and the reestablishing of trust has 
yet to be set up. Violent demonstrations were organized recently 
in the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, against the deployment of 
foreign troops.

  [Text] There is a happy ending to the political crisis 
between the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allied 
[USORAL] last night at the People's Palace. The Allied Forces 
in the name of the best interest of the nation, simply withdrew 
the candidates to the presidency of the parliament to make way 
for the old bureau led by the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition. 
  [Unidentified reporter] At 2200 at the People's Palace, the 
moment was marked by the end of despair and emotion sustained by 
the USORAL for 48 hours following a disagreement over the 
members of this political group that should be members of the 
bureau. After a very tense moment exacerbated by strongly 
termed statements and after a four-hour interruption that 
enabled the two sides to organize a vote to come to an 
agreement, Mr. (Joseph Singawuju) took the floor to withdraw the 
candidates of the Allied Forces -- (Ninda Kabika) and Dr. 
(Bwasa) -- deciding that there should not be a win-or-lose 
attitude. An immense joy erupted in the conference room. 
People embraced one another. There was applause to mark the 
end of the conflict that almost led the deliberations into an 
impasse. 
  (Ange Luni Bembe), (Kaben Bingo), Nguyi Nduba, and Vangu 
Mambwene will from now on -- and until the next legislative 
elections -- be the close aides of Monsignor Monsengwo. 
  On the other hand, the former bureau led by the USORAL, 
including Joseph Ileo, Christophe Lutumbula, (Kinkela Vinkanci) 
and Valentin Mubaka, will continue to hold office in the new 
legislative body. Called to take the floor, the leader of the 
bureau, Valentin Mubaka, could not find the words to express his 
joy and expressed his gratitude to his colleagues for showing 
the necessary political will to put an end to the dual 
institutions. 
  The new bureau will be officially and solemnly presented 
today as of 1400 in the presence of the diplomatic corps invited 
at the People's Palace to attend the ceremony.

<F P=106> [Address by Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo Pasinga, speaker of </F>
the High Council of the Republic, in Kinshasa on 26 January -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Honorable HCR [High Council of the Republic] 
members, Your Excellencies the ambassadors and heads of 
diplomatic missions, distinguished guests: On this day of the 
opening of the extraordinary session of our interim legislative 
institution, I would like to wholeheartedly bid you all welcome. 
Some of you have been actors and others witnesses of what men 
can achieve when their actions are based on the will to 
understand and on good faith. [passage omitted] 
  Dear brothers and sisters of the interim parliament, Zaire 
our country did not drop like a bolt from the blue. This 
institutional order whose texts you are going to finalize did 
not fall from heaven. It is the outcome of a scrutiny of the 
constitutional legacy handed down from the past, from the 
colonial era until today, via the one-party system. At each 
stage of constitutional change, we receive as a legacy our past, 
with its strong and weak points, based on which we build the 
change to come. 
  The last stage of the constitutional change was that of the 
Sovereign National Conference [CNS], with an institutional order 
governed by the deed setting forth the constitutional provisions 
for the transition period. This legacy surely has its strong 
and weak points. Several unilateral steps were undertaken by 
individuals to improve it without success. Today, it is 
together that we want to do so on the basis of the political 
consultation we have all encouraged. Let us do so without 
emotion or partisan thinking, but rather in a sober and 
responsible manner. 
  In this regard, it is true that the deliberations of the 
political class do not automatically bind the institution. It 
is also true that the deliberations of the political class do 
not carry the signature of all the negotiators; hence, they 
cannot legally constitute a law binding the parties. But it 
should be noted that their work contains several points of 
agreement, which are the gains of the political class that must 
be taken into account because, in a parliamentary system, it 
would not be logical for the institution to fail to take account 
of the thinking of the political class which makes up the said 
institution. [passage omitted] 
  It will not only be dangerous, but also harmful for the 
honor 
and credibility of the Zairian political actor if the political 
class happens to renege these points of agreement whereas the 
public opinion (?grants it) the points of disagreement which 
persist. It therefore behooves the political class to 
demonstrate its maturity by remaining consistent and logical in 
the defense of its gains within the interim legislative 
institution. [passage omitted] 
  The main concern of the political class during the 
transition 
period is security, in order that no politician may be unfairly 
rendered unable to take part in elections. The importance 
politicians attach to positioning themselves in the interim 
institutions is understandable. [passage omitted] It is 
therefore important that at the level of the president of the 
Republic, head of state, whose function is to serve as the 
guarantor of national unity and at those of the legislative 
organ and the executive, this balanced representation be 
guaranteed during the transition period. 
  The executive has a great responsibility since it is charged 
with implementing the principles of fairness in the key organs 
of government machinery. But since some organs cannot 
necessarily be subjected to certain aspects of equity, including 
the ideological representation aspects, such organs will be 
required to be neutral and apolitical. This is particularly the 
case of the security and law enforcement agencies, the public 
service, and the utilities. The Army, the security and law 
enforcement agencies, and the public service must be in the 
service of the Republic and the citizen, irrespective of their 
tribal or ethnic affiliation, or even their political thinking. 
The public service, including the department of territorial 
administration, must, in short, be in the service of the 
Republic and the citizen. [passage omitted] 
  Among the public service departments, one has particularly 
engaged the attention of the political class: the state-run 
media -- i.e. the radio, the television, and the ZAIRIAN PRESS 
AGENCY. The CNS dealt at length with this question and the 
political class took it up again in its consultations. As [word 
indistinct] put it: Where the public opinion ceases to find free 
expression, peace is in jeopardy. One could confidently state: 
Tell me how the mass media is organized in your country and I 
will tell you the system that reigns there. 
  The state-run media have been monopolized by governments 
throughout the world without their necessarily being used to 
provide objective information but rather to serve propaganda 
purposes. This is why under systems of ideological pluralism, 
democratic countries have created mechanisms that guarantee all 
political leanings the right to get their message across to the 
public. One such mechanism is to entrust the running of these 
public services to a committee representing the principal 
ideological leanings and to stop the state or a particular 
political group from monopolizing their functioning. Since the 
transition is the prefiguration of the Third Republic -- which 
we would all like to be democratic and pluralistic -- it can 
only have state-run media that serve all the various political 
leanings. This is a prerequisite of the democratic principles 
that must guide us. The apolitical nature of the Army, security 
forces, and government services, as well as the free access of 
all political leanings to the state-run media and the right of 
all citizens to information, constitute one of the absolutely 
essential conditions for democratic, open, and, therefore, 
reliable elections. 
  With respect to politicians who have been appointed to head 
political institutions or territorial bodies, they must show 
neutrality in carrying out their duties since their political 
leanings must not violate the rights of those who belong to 
another political family. They must occupy their post without 
taking financial charge of their political parties. To 
paraphrase a French statesman, this is the price democracy 
demands. 
  Honorable HCR members, distinguished guests, ladies, and 
gentlemen: It has become a common utterance to say that the 
economic and social conditions of our people are deplorable. 
However, the word deplorable does not really convey the 
dramatic situation of the country's average citizen especially 
in the big urban centers. Low salaries and speculative 
skyrocketing prices exist while certain commercial activities 
flourish by shamelessly exploiting the misery of our people. 
  The political class deliberated on these questions and 
recommended some urgent solutions. Whatever the case, the 
consolidation of strength of all the active forces of the 
country is necessary for meeting the challenge of achieving the 
country's economic and social recovery. The holding of 
consultations among businessmen, trade unions, and public 
authorities is indispensable. These consultations must be placed 
under the sign of national solidarity. It is good to note that 
the awareness of the people themselves to contribute to work on 
one side, and on the other, in the provision of self-protection 
against excesses is an indispensable backup measure for adopting 
the measures recommended by the said consultations. It is only 
the combination of these factors which can marginalize murderous 
speculators, provided the state regains all its capabilities of 
public authority and exercises them without complacency against 
the recalcitrant ones who go to excess. 
  What is happening in fuel stations is quite more 
scandalizing. The way in which Chinese rice was being sold is 
uncontrollable and is likely to discourage all those people who, 
either in the country or abroad, try to relieve the misery of 
our people. The state must set up a minimum of efficient 
organization capable of sending out locally or externally 
produced essential commodities to the needy consumers without 
their passing through useless, expensive, or uncontrolled 
intermediaries. The success of recovery is at this price. It 
is not a regime of a police state that we want, but the regime 
of a state that, on behalf of the citizens and the society, 
plays the role of the guarantor of public order where every 
citizen can fully enjoy his right in justice and dignity. 
  The advocates of liberal economy will probably feel 
frustrated by this address. They should not worry. I am far 
away from the idea to condemn market economy and the Sovereign 
National Conference has opted for social market economy. The 
crisis in Zaire prevents the interplay of the normal rule of 
competition. For as long as production will not be reactivated 
to ensure abundance, the state must promote and, if need be, 
constraint the citizens to solidarity through appropriate 
machineries. The state will see to it that the economic space 
is not transformed into a jungle to the detriment of the poor as 
is the case presently. 
  We finally want to suggest that it must be a national 
moratorium between the National Association of Zairian 
Enterprises, all branches of the trade unions, including the 
press, and the government in order to sanitize and to ensure the 
political, economic, and social well being of the of the nation. 
During this moratorium period, the businessmen must endeavor to 
maintain their profit margin within a reasonable limit, while 
the trade unions limit their salary demands at a decent level, 
and the media, following the political leaders must try to 
discipline themselves to correctly inform and keep to positive 
criticisms and refrain from personal attacks which destroy the 
honor and dignity of citizens so as to promote the democratic 
virtues of dialogue and tolerance. 
  As for the government, it must be committed to grant fiscal 
facilities so as to stimulate production and encourage this by 
actions which will strengthen its credibility and authority 
through the creation of conditions of security for people and 
their property. 
  Dear brothers and sisters, transitional parliamentarians, 
the 
fate of our people is in our hands. Let us try to work 
together, constantly bearing in mind our priority duty to 
eradicate the misery into which the people of our country have 
been plunged. In this regard, let us forget what divides and 
promote what unites us. In this way, we will be doing a great 
service to our country and history, as well to future 
generations who will be grateful to us. 
  My brothers, sisters, republican councilors, ambassadors, 
and 
heads of diplomatic missions, ladies, and gentlemen, I cannot 
end this address without turning to my colleagues of the bureau 
and congratulate them on the confidence that the assembly has 
placed in them by appointing them bureau members. 
  They are all lay persons and are called upon to assume the 
temporal duties, as God recommends, for the happiness of the 
people. They will therefore understand that once the bureau is 
inaugurated, I am leaving the responsibility of managing current 
affairs of the HCR/Transitional Parliament, in order to 
concentrate on finding solutions to problems that may arise in 
the event of any major crisis under the same conditions as those 
accepted by the Sovereign National Conference on 5 December 
1992. It is on these words, honorable HCR members, dear 
ambassadors, and heads of diplomatic mission, ladies, and 
gentlemen, and demanding the blessing of the Eternal for our 
country that I declare the end of the solemn opening session of 
the HCR, our transitional parliament. I thank you.

  [Text] Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa received Amadou 
Toure, International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium 
[INTELSAT] regional director for Africa, in his office today. 
Their discussions centered on the payment of Zaire's arrears to 
the organization. Muako Alibaba has the details: 
  [Alibaba] INTELSAT might cut its telephone and television 
services to Zaire at the national and international levels, for 
failure to honor its financial obligations. This situation was 
at the center of the discussions that the prime minister held 
with Mr. Toure at his office today in the presence of (Philippe 
Gelezi Tutua Kabanzili), minister of posts, telephones, and 
telecommunications. After the discussions, the INTELSAT regional 
director for Africa had this to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Toure] In my capacity as INTELSAT 
regional 
director for Africa, I paid a courtesy call on the prime 
minister who agreed to receive me. In general, we discussed 
African issues such as the important project known as the 
regional African satellite system and other problems concerning 
Zaire in particular. Among these problems are the present 
delayed payment of Zaire's contributions, and in view of the 
recent decisions made by INTELSAT board of governors, Zaire's 
national and international telephone and television traffic 
might be cut. This is why I deemed it advisable to come here to 
discuss the situation with the authorities to avoid such a cut, 
as it would adversely affect the African group within the board 
of governors. 
  I first discussed the problem with the minister of 
telecommunications and with the National Telecommunications 
Corporation. We succeeded in drawing up a number of measures 
which I believe, once implemented, could help solve the problem 
soon. We also discussed other problems that may crop up in 
future and ways of preventing Zaire from facing a similar 
situation. We hope that our cooperation will be fruitful. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What was the prime minister's 
reaction in the face of all these problems? 
  [Toure] First, I was very satisfied with the reactions of 
the 
minister of telecommunications and the prime minister who 
received me immediately after my arrival in view of the urgent 
situation. I was very satisfied with the measures taken before 
my arrival, because this problem is a longstanding one. The 
Ministry of Telecommunications has already started taking a 
number of steps, and I was very satisfied to note them here 
myself. We received some promises and support from the prime 
minister to help solve the problem. We believe that before the 
deadline -- we only have one month left, that is 27 February -- 
the problem will be solved, taking into account the prime 
minister's reactions. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] A last-minute effort to reach an agreement with 
the Freedom Alliance over the transitional constitution will be 
made tomorrow. An attempt to arrange such a meeting is being 
made. The government's chief negotiator, Roelf Meyer, told the 
media tonight that the constitutional differences between the 
three parties involved are not unbridgeable. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording, Meyer in progress] ...the differences are 
in fact very small, and I really hope that tomorrow -- if the 
talks do take place -- we will eliminate those things that are 
still in the way. It is all about formulation of the relevant 
items which deal with powers and capabilities of provinces in 
the new dispensation. As far as the government is concerned, we 
have made a proposal on how the problem can be solved, but if we 
get the ANC's cooperation and Freedom Alliance's on this, then 
there should be no problem. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Meyer was more optimistic about the 
negotiations with the Afrikaner National Front on a homeland for 
whites and about talks with the kwaZulu kingship over the role 
of the Zulu king in a future dispensation. 
  [Meyer] The talks during the last week with the National 
Front and the Zulu king's representatives went off well. There 
are positive signs, and I think that on both of those aspects we 
could come to an agreement as early as tomorrow. The most 
important assurance from our side to the supporters of a 
homeland -- and that is what has surfaced in our previous 
discussions -- is that the homeland idea has to be accepted as a 
possible solution for self- determination for the Afrikaner. 
And we are now trying to find a formula on how that fact can be 
assured and be continued even after the election. [end recording]

  [Text] Peace talks in Lusaka [words indistinct] specific 
points of the national police dossier [words indistinct] 
modalities for the application of general and specific 
principles. The government delegation is worried because its 
proposal has so far been in agreement with the thinking of the 
mediator and the troika of observers. 
  The numbers proposed by the government for the participation 
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] in the national police and the rapid intervention unit 
are about 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively. UNITA always 
distant, has on various occasions changed its proposal on 
percentages to be adopted for its participation in police, but 
so far, it has not been able to convince the mediator to the 
point of convening a face-to-face meeting or a plenary session 
to resolve the issue. The Black Cockerel's negotiators want 35 
percent participation in national police and 50 percent 
participation in the riot police.

interior minister's ban on the union rally at the Cotonou Labor 
Exchange on 25 January, saying in communique that they deplore 
the interior minister's violation of demonstration rights. 
  [Unidentified reporter] In its communique, the Beninese 
Human 
Rights Commission refers to Article 25 of the 11 December 1990 
Beninese Constitution, which stipulates that the state 
recognizes [words indistinct] the conditions fixed by the law, 
the freedom of movement, the freedom of association, the freedom 
to meet, the freedom to stage marches and demonstrations. The 
Beninese Human Rights Commission therefore states that in light 
of that, the interior minister's decision is arbitrary and 
illegal. It therefore condemns the minister's decision and 
calls on the government to take necessary measures to ensure 
that such acts are not repeated in Benin. 
  The Independent Parliamentary Group also referred to Article 
25 of the Beninese Constitution and reminded the public that 
such actions should not be tolerated in the country. [passage

  [Text] Brazzaville, 27 Jan (AFP)--On 27 January, the 
Congolese Workers' Federation [Confederation Syndicale des 
Travailleurs Congolais, CSTC] -- one of the leading Congolese 
trades unions -- called for an "indefinite" general strike 
starting from 6 February to compel the government to increase 
civil servants' salary by 70 percent. 
  A communique issued by the CSTC states that the salary 
increase will enable 80,000 civil servants "to offset the 
deficit caused by the CFA franc devaluation as well as 
counterbalance its unfavorable effects. The federation is also 
calling for the settlement of "at least" four months' salary 
arrears out of the 10 months' arrears owed to civil servants. 
Following the devaluation, the Congolese Government dropped its 
decision to reduce civil servants' salary by 20 to 35 percent as 
part of the structural adjustment program adopted shortly before 
the devaluation. 
  Furthermore, the federation is calling on the government not 
to "lay off" the 7,000 civil workers whose irregular status was 
discovered by the State Inspection Board during a recent check. 
The CSTC was created in December 1993 by dissidents of the 
Congolese Trades Union Confederation [CSC] and has 40,000 
members. It is led by Mr. Louis Gondou, who was formerly CSC's 
second in command.

  [Text] There is open conflict between businessmen and the 
Customs and Excise Office [FIDA] over the unilateral fixing of 
the exchange rate by FIDA management at 90 new zaires to the 
dollar, while the Bank of Zaire's official rate is 35 new zaires 
to the dollar. This state of affairs has given rise to protests 
these days by members of the National Association of Zaire 
Enterprises [ANEZA). Over to you, Kalinda Molonu: 
  [Molonu] For businessmen, FIDA's measure is causing sheer 
anarchy because the fixing of the official exchange rate, they 
argue, is only within the competence of the Central Bank. It is 
illegal for any public service to fix the foreign exchange rate 
for its charges outside the official rate fixed by the Central 
Bank and the commercial banks. In a note to FIDA regional 
directors, the headquarters of this state public company 
explained that its decision was made in view of the very big 
loss incurred by the public treasury in implementing the Bank of 
Zaire's official exchange rate. 
  ANEZA feels that the more than 150 percent increase in the 
exchange rate decided by FIDA will cause a more than 150 percent 
increase in the prices of basic commodities, as well as total 
confusion in the exchange market because businessmen will no 
longer know which rate to refer to in their export transactions.

  [Text] Angolans are still hopeful about the outcome of the 
Lusaka talks between the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Luanda regime. Angolans, 
as a whole, long for peace. 
  Meanwhile, diplomatic sources following the talks say the 
proceedings continue today with the discussion of the final 
aspects on the formation of the new national police force. 
Yesterday, the sides agreed on specific issues. The sources 
stressed that the two sides regard as possible the approval of 
the general document on the second round of talks. It has been 
suggested that the delegations are committed to establishing a 
just peace for Angola, despite the military operations carried 
out by the Luanda regime with the backing of one of the 
observers to he peace process. This has created a great deal of 
confusion about Russian's role in the ongoing talks.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with the Director of the South African </F>
Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Rusty Evans, by reporter Bob 
Barker on the "Channel Africa Report" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] Members of the task force formed to investigate the 
unrest in Lesotho are meeting in Pretoria today prior to flying 
to Maseru tomorrow morning to conduct on-the-site interviews 
with the warring military forces. On the line is the South 
African director of foreign affairs, Mr. Rusty Evans. 
  [Begin recording] [Evans] We had the opportunity yesterday 
in 
Gaborone to be briefed by two ministers of the ... [pauses] the 
deputy prime minister and the minister from the Lesotho 
Government. There was consensus among the heads of state 
present in Gaborone yesterday, that it would be helpful, at the 
request of the Lesotho Government, if a group of people could 
take it upon themselves to liaise very closely with all the 
parties concerned in Lesotho, with a view to, A, getting a very 
clear picture as to what the prevailing circumstances are, and 
B, to make a recommendation to government in the region as to 
what action might be called for or might be helpful to resolve 
any differences that still exist down there. 
  [Reporter] So the team, actually, who goes down will then 
report back to the various presidents of the Frontline States? 
  [Evans] In fact there is an arrangement whereby there will 
be 
a ministerial meeting in Pretoria on Monday. This has already 
been scheduled. The foreign ministers of the three countries 
concerned, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, will be meeting 
on Monday and the task group will be reporting to those 
ministers here in Pretoria. 
  [Barker] But there is a chance that there could be a 
military 
presence from the Frontline States that you have just mentioned, 
if it does not work out? 
  [Evans] I should imagine that, that's a conceivable option 
but at this stage I think it's a little premature, frankly. I 
think that one should allow the task group to do their work. 
They are professional people. They are diplomats and very 
senior personnel from the respective ministries of Foreign 
Affairs and the Departments of Defense of the three countries. 
The problem in Lesotho is essentially a military problem, so 
you know, it's necessary to have military expertise in a group 
of that nature. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [Begin recording] [passage omitted covered by

today was anxious to deny that they put in any kind of request 
for a task force including South Africa? 
  [Maurison] Yes, it is true, the foreign minister 
categorically denied the fact that [word indistinct] task force 
which is getting ready to come to Lesotho to enter the (?focus) 
between the two factions of the army. He said that the 
Government of Lesotho knows nothing about the meeting in 
Gaborone and the outcome of such a meeting, and as such, they 
will never accept any foreign task force because they are in 
complete control of the situation at home. 
  [White] But, I thought that the Botswana minister [as heard] 
was in Gaborone for this meeting? 
  [Maurison] The Lesotho deputy prime minister and the 
minister 
of law and justice were both attending the Gaborone meeting. 
  [White] So, how can they deny any knowledge of it? 
  [Maurison] I think it is very easy for the foreign minister 
to deny knowledge of this because in the last few days 
government has been saying one thing today and then denying it 
flatly the next day, but everybody knows that the deputy prime 
minister was in Gaborone for the meeting with the minister of 
justice. 
  [White] But the official line now is that they don't want 
any 
kind of outside intervention? 
  [Maurison] The foreign minister assured the army at 
Makoanyane barracks that the government would never accept any 
foreign task force from South Africa or anywhere for that 
matter. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] All sorts of initiatives are flying around to try 
and bring peace back to Lesotho. For two weeks opposing 
factions of the army, one from the Makoanyane barracks and the 
other from defense headquarters, have been fighting each other 
around the capital, Maseru. It all began with a pay claim, but 
there have been fears of it developing into a coup against Ntsu 
Mokhehle's elected government. Yesterday a meeting of southern 
African leaders in Gaborone was talking of a task force to be 
sent by Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. They could find 
the door shut. But today, Commonwealth representatives have 
been meeting the two sides in Maseru. The foreign minister was 
there too, and it seems some progress was made. On the line to 
Maseru Robin White asked Mamelo Maurison of the MORNING STAR 
newspaper what the outcome of the meetings had been. 
  [Begin recording] [Maurison] Well, the outcome of the 
meetings is that the foreign informed the Makoanyane side of the 
army that they should nominate 10 representatives who will seat 
for extensive discussions with the 10 from RLDF [Royal Swazi 
Defense Force] tomorrow under the chairmanship of the 
Commonwealth team. 
  [White] And they will try and flush out some kind of deal 
tomorrow? 
  [Maurison] The foreign minister said they should be 
prepared, 
they should prepare their agenda, including the 100-percent 
demand and everything that worries them to be in the agenda for 
tomorrow's meeting and that all these complaints will be looked 
at with the assistance of the Commonwealth team. 
  [White] And I gather that some kind of promise was made that 
there will be no action taken against those that have been 
causing trouble? 
  [Maurison] Yes, the foreign minister said he was passing the 
message from the prime minister, who is also minister of 
defense, that no recriminations will be taken against any of the 
soldiers for any of their actions in the last few days, and that 
they must rest assured that nothing will happen to anyone of 
them. 
  [White] Even to those who killed people? 
  [Maurison] He said whatever has happened, nothing will 
happen. 
  [White] So, is it your feeling that they might be on the way 
now to some kind of deal? 
  [Maurison] It will depend largely on whether the two sides 
will indeed appoint their representatives, and whether the 
representatives, when they seat under the auspices of the 
Commonwealth, will be willing to talk out their differences, but 
by the look of things, it may take some bit of time. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The UN Secretary General's representative Aldo 
Ajello has said in Maputo that there is an imbalance in the 
confinement of troops. Ajello said the Mozambique National 
Resistance has used more than 70 percent of its assembly areas, 
while the government has used 30 to 35 percent. At its meeting 
in Maputo on 27 January, the Supervision and Control Commission 
recommended that the government speed up the confinement of its 
troops and pledged the necessary logistical assistance to speed 
up the process. 
  Minister Armando Guebuza said the government has not sent 
sufficient troops to specific assembly areas because the latter 
lack the technical capacity to accommodate people. He said 
several areas face food problems, adding that a number of 
technical units cannot register more than 50 people.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] On the line to Maputo, Timothy Ecott asked the UN 
special representative, Aldo Ajello, what they were doing about 
the accusations of child abuse. 
  [Begin recording] [Ajello] Well, the first time I received 
the news about this allegation was from Save the Children Norway 
in December. I asked immediately the forward commander to make 
an investigation, and I asked Save the Children Norway to 
provide additional information because what they gave us was 
very little. They just said that they had news and information 
about some UN soldiers sexually abusing children. 
Unfortunately, Save the Children Norway was not in position to 
give us any additional information. The forward commander has 
started an investigation, and I don't think that he has got 
very, very serious results. There was subsequently another 
allegation, always from Save the Children Norway, and I insisted 
once again with the forward commander that he had to make a more 
serious and detailed investigation. And once again he came up 
with no evidence of this allegation. Finally, we had this third 
round now. And now I decided to put in charge of an inquiry 
board my deputy, Mr. (Sadre), and he has already built up the 
body and he is looking at that very carefully and very seriously. 
  [Ecott] What do you make of the allegations yourself, Mr. 
Ajello? 
  [Ajello] Well, it is very difficult to say. The juvenile 
prostitution in this country is at an incredible level, but I 
hope that UN troops are not involved in this. We are ready to 
clarify this question, to make a very serious investigation. 
And if anybody has been responsible for that, he will be 
immediately repatriated. 
  [Ecott] You say that juvenile prostitution, as you call it, 
is at a high level. Does that mean you think it is likely this 
sort of thing could have gone on? 
  [Ajello] No, obviously not. But, unfortunately, it is going 
on. 
  [Ecott] What about the effects of these allegations on the 
United Nations' reputation in Mozambique? Are you worried about 
that? 
  [Ajello] If this should be proved, I think that the effect 
will not be certainly positive. But I think it would have a 
very positive effect if we take immediate measures to stop it 
and to punish who has been responsible for that, which I have 
all the intentions to do. 
  [Ecott] The allegations, you say, were fairly vague 
originally from Norway, but now there does seem to be evidence 
of troops of girls being supplied on one particular occasion at 
an official function. Can you comment on that? 
  [Ajello] Well, this is exactly what my deputy is looking at, 
and he is making a very serious investigation. I don't want to 
interfere with his work at this stage. 
  [Ecott] How long do you think that investigation will take? 
  [Ajello] I think that must be very short, and he has been 
instructed to do that very quickly in the most flexible [way] he 
can. He is quite a skilled person. I am very confident that he 
will be able to provide me with a very convincing report about 
that. [end recording]

  [Text] Windhoek Jan 27 SAPA--African National Congress 
[ANC] Deputy President Walter Sisulu arrived in Windhoek on 
Thursday [27 January] to launch an ANC solidarity and fund 
raising campaign organised by Namibia's ruling SWAPO [South-West 
African People's Organization] party. 
  Accompanied by ANC Election Commission Chairman Popo Molefe 
and other senior officials, Mr Sisulu is scheduled to address a 
rally with Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Thursday night. He 
returns to South Africa on Saturday, leaving the other officials 
to address rallies and meetings across Namibia next week. 
  SWAPO, which has been at pains to stress the campaign is 
organised by the party and not the government, said it was 
supporting the ANC as the only way towards regional peace and 
stability. 
  SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said Namibian 
independence rested on peace in South Africa, and that this 
could only be attained under an ANC government. He appealed to 
all South Africans in Namibia to register and vote in the April 
elections.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ties Established With Israel"] </F>
  [Text] On the eve of a visit by a high-level business 
delegation from Jerusalem, the government has announced that 
diplomatic ties will be established with Israel. As early as 
last year, the presence of a Namibian embassy in Israel would 
have been unthinkable because of SWAPO's [South-West African 
People's Organization] open criticism of the Jewish state. 
Shortly after independence, the Namibian Government formally 
established diplomatic ties with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization [PLO] at the ambassadorial level and continued its 
campaign of open support for the organization of Yasir 'Arafat. 
A brief statement issued last week on decisions made at the 
first cabinet meeting in Windhoek for 1994 notes that the 
cabinet has decided to empower Minister of Foreign Affairs Theo 
Ben Gurirab to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel. 
  The cabinet has also given its permission for a high-level 
Israeli business delegation to visit Namibia within the next 
three weeks and for ministries to hold talks with the delegation 
on "areas of interest" for Namibia. The cabinet has taken note 
of the policy objectives being pursued at this stage, concerning 
the Middle East and especially the negotiations between the PLO 
and the Israeli Government. In his New Year's message to the 
diplomatic corps last week, the president, Mr. Sam Nujoma, 
referred to the agreement between Israel and the PLO as one of 
the top "achievements" of 1993. He said that the prospects of 
self-government for Palestine is closer than ever before 
following the signing of the peace agreement. Israel and the 
PLO signed the historic agreement on Palestinian autonomy in 
Gaza and Jericho in Washington on 13 September. In the 
agreement, Israel and the PLO undertook to officially recognize 
each other.

<F P=106> [From the "Channel Africa Report" program] </F>
  [Text] A three-day conference aimed at restructuring South 
Africa's security forces has opened in the Zimbabwean capital 
Harare. The conference is being attended by senior military and 
police personnel and officials of the African National Congress 
[ANC] and the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC]. Trevor Grundy has 
the details: 
  The conference this week is being organized by the Southern 
African Peacekeeping and Peacemaking Project, which operates 
under the auspices of the Institute of International Education 
in New York. The first conference of this kind on South Africa 
was held in Harare in June of last year. Over 70 delegates are 
attending at the Harare International Conference Center and this 
afternoon Justice Richard Goldstone will be talking about the 
prevention of public violence and intimidation in South Africa, 
before and after the elections. Other contributors will be 
General Smit, the deputy commissioner of the South African 
Police Force, Chief Superintendent (Peter Stephens) of Scotland 
Yard, Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn, the former Chief of Staff 
of the SADF [South African Defense Force], Enoch Dambuchena, 
Zimbabwe's former chief justice, plus representatives of the ANC 
and the PAC. 
  The conference opened as President Mugabe was meeting 
President de Klerk for the first time in Botswana. That meeting 
was attended by Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, so in Harare 
someone else has to read his speech. Minister Mahachi praised 
the SADF, the ANC, and the PAC for making attempts to work 
alongside one another to create a national defense force. He 
also called on all soldiers in South Africa to be democratic and 
fair after, as well as before, the April election. It would, he 
said, be a very sad day indeed if the freedom of democratic 
processes -- if the South African Defense Forces should be found 
rejecting the wishes of South Africans, where the process is 
judged to be free and fair by the international community. 
  In a keynote address the current president of the United 
Nations General Assembly warned against widespread violence. 
Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana said that the South 
African law authorities must begin to deal effectively and 
fairly with any threat or disturbance to peace. Deviation at 
this stage, he said, would only lead to disaster and plunge 
South Africa into what he calls dangerous uncertainty.

  [Text] The former head of the Transitional 
Zimbabwe/Rhodesia Government, Mr. Abel Muzorewa, today joined 
opposition leader Mr. Edgar Tekere in an ambitious bid to topple 
President Robert Mugabe's government. The merger was announced 
at a joint news conference in the capital Harare. Mr. Muzorewa, 
aged 67, a retired clergyman of the U.S.-based United Methodist 
Church and leader of the now small opposition party United 
National African Council, and Mr. Tekere, leader of the Zimbabwe 
Unity Movement, ZUM, became co-president of the new party which 
has retained the name ZUM. 
  The retired bishop has made a comeback after retiring from 
politics in 1985 following 10 months of detention by Mr. 
Mugabe's government for alleged subversive activities. He was 
in the limelight in 1970's, when the other black nationalists 
like Mr. Mugabe and Vice President Dr. Joshua Nkomo were either 
exiled or detained by the former Rhodesian rebel leader, Mr. Ian 
Smith. 
  Mr. Muzorewa headed the transitional government to a black 
majority rule set up by Mr. Smith, but lost to Mr. Mugabe in the 
1980 elections because of his alignment to whites.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] South Africa's marathon constitutional negotiations 
were given a four-day reprieve on Thursday [27 January] night 
when negotiators agreed to delay the deadline for an 
all-inclusive settlement until Monday. African National Congress 
[ANC] and government negotiators emerged shortly before midnight 
to announce that the Freedom Alliance had requested, and been 
granted, until Monday to examine a set of proposals devised by 
the ANC. 
  "The talks are proceeding and the deadline could be said to 
be extended," Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer 
said. Instead of promulgating the April election on Friday as 
expected, the announcement was being delayed for what were 
described as "technical reasons". 
  It is understood, however, that the anticipation of progress 
in the trilateral talks prompted the delay. This will in effect 
give the Alliance the opportunity to declare its participation 
in the election before the actual announcement of the April 
27-29 dates decided on by the ANC-dominated Transitional 
Executive Council earlier this week. 
  Thursday night's trilateral talks coincided with two other 
sets of negotiations, the first involving the Afrikaner 
Volksfront (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front], the government and 
the ANC on an Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland] and the second 
involving government and a delegation of the kwaZulu king. 
  The three sets of talks may result in at least two changes 
to 
the constitution. Although there is no direct link between the 
different talks, the "volkstaat" and Zulu monarchy talks address 
the concerns of key alliance partners, namely the Afrikaner 
right wing and, indirectly, Inkatha. 
  Mr Meyer said the Zulu talks could involve the addition of a 
constitutional principle on the role of traditional leaders, 
among them the Zulu king. He said the trilateral negotiations 
had taken note of progress in the talks on a "volkstaat". 
However, an earlier expectation of substantial progress on a 
"volkstaat" failed to materialise. 
  Mr Meyer said a new hitch had arisen which the negotiators 
were trying to resolve. In the trilateral talks, Mr Meyer said 
the same issue that surfaced earlier in the week had arisen 
again. This involved the definition of regional powers which the 
Alliance wanted characterised as "exlusive". 
  In agreeing to this, the ANC had added, however, that such 
exclusive powers would, if granted, have to be exercised within 
a centrally-directed legislative framework. 
  ANC negotiator Mohammed Valli Moosa said the addition of a 
new constitutional principle had arisen in the trilateral talks. 
The principle dealt with the integrity of regional 
constitutions. He said the anc was discussing a package of 
agreements with the Alliance. The package included provisions on 
the powers, functions and fiscal independence of regions. 
  He said the ANC's proposals took into account most of the 
Alliance's legitimate demands. "We are hoping at this late stage 
that the Freedom Alliance will realise that it is in their best 
interest to become part of the political process. 
  "The fact that negotiations are continuing indicates that 
there is a possibility that they may well accept the interim 
constitution. 
  "Our proposals were not rejected out of hand and that 
indicates the show is still on the road," Mr Valli Moosa said.

  [Text] Constitutional negotiations were given a four-day 
reprieve last night when negotiators agreed to delay the 
deadline for an all inclusive settlement until Monday [31 
January]. This followed a request by the Freedom Alliance that 
the deadline should be postponed to give it the opportunity to 
examine a set of proposals devised by the ANC [African National 
Congress]. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after 
talks between the government, the ANC and the Freedom Alliance 
that the government had made a proposal regarding the future of 
the Zulu king and Natal/KwaZulu. A constitutional principle 
providing for traditional leadership is to be discussed with the 
Zulu king this weekend. However, new problems arose regarding a 
volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners. 
  Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said that the 
proposals submitted to the alliance were considered to have vast 
implications, and that urgent consultations with alliance 
leaders were imperative. Discussions were to have begun last 
night after the trilateral meeting. Mr. Cronje said the fact 
that the state president would be prevented from promulgating 
the election date today gave the alliance additional time to 
look for an acceptable solution. He said that changes to the 
constitution would not have been easy after the promulgation of 
the election date.

  [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] had the media guessing today when they 
called an unexpected joint media conference at the PAC offices 
in Johannesburg. But according to the leaders of the two 
organizations, today's meeting was in line with ongoing talks 
between the two groups. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Nan Roux] The ongoing violence 
and the rejection of a one-ballot system for the coming 
elections. These were the issues discussed at a meeting between 
IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and PAC President Clarence 
Makwetu. The two leaders said such a system was undemocratic 
and would rob voters of their freedom to choose parties at both 
the provincial and national level. 
  [Makwetu] If we talk of democracy, if I vote on a provincial 
level, and I want to vote differently on a national level I 
should have liberty to do so. It should not be decided by the 
bureaucrat where my vote should lie. 
  [Roux] Mr. Makwetu said the PAC and the IFP had already 
contacted the Democratic Party, the Dikwankwetla Party, and 
others who favor the two-ballot system, in order to work out a 
joint strategy. On the issues of violence, both leaders 
committed themselves to addressing the situation as soon as 
possible for fear that it might jeopardize the entire election 
process. 
  [Makwetu] I support a move by the people directly involved 
in 
the violence sitting together, trying to resolve their 
differences. 
  [Roux] Mr. Makwetu said joint activity between the PAC, the 
IFP, and the ANC, was the only solution. [end recording]

  [Text] Middelburg, Eastern Transvaal, Jan 27 SAPA--The 
African National Congress [ANC] was the real lame duck party 
carrying the weight of all the failures of communism across the 
world, State President F W de Klerk said on Thursday [27 
January]. 
  He was on an election road show stop at the Kanhym feeder 
farm outside Middelburg where he addressed an audience of a 
1,000, two thirds of them black. 
  He was welcomed in jamboree style with a four-piece band, 
singalongs and viva shouts along with a constant drone of boos 
from an apparently ANC supporting section of the audience. 
  Mr de Klerk told his audience South Africa had changed under 
the transition process initiated by the NP [National Party]. 
"Now it is the ANC who tells you you may not buy there, you may 
not walk here and you may not go to that meeting." 
  He warned the ANC was not to be trusted and would become a 
suppressing party. "Mr Mandela recently claimed ours is a lame 
duck government. But this party is a very alive duck swimming 
to a win. It is the ANC that is way down in the water as a lame 
duck carrying the weight of the South African Communist Party 
[SACP] and all the failures of communism across the world." 
  The ANC list of political candidates carried names of failed 
politicians such as Nelson Ramodike and Prince James Mahlangu 
who had wrecked their respective homelands of Lebowa and 
kwaNdebele with maladministration. "They are way down on the 
list along with Winnie Mandela... Let me say no more." 
  Mr de Klerk was supported throughout with shouts of viva. 
The group which booed fell silent towards the end of the 
meeting when he referred to the ANC's economic policies and 
specifically to Mozambique as an example of such policies. "The 
world is divided into a rich half and a poor half," he said. 
"The poor half of the world is where the policies of communism 
and Marxism have been applied -- where the policies of the ANC 
have been applied." "Just look at Mozambique where everybody 
has been made poor, jobs have been lost and the country has 
retrogressed." "South Africa looks much better. And what 
party's policy was applied? -- the NP's". 
  The NP stood for one man, one job and for economic growth, 
but the ANC was introducing aspects of SACP and Cosatu [Congress 
of South African Trade Unions] policies to satisfy them and this 
would make all South Africans poorer and frighten off 
international investors.

  [Text] Witbank Jan 28 SAPA--National Party [NP] leader F.W. 
de Klerk, on the election campaign trail in the Eastern 
Transvaal, was given a heated reception by African National 
Congress [ANC]-supporting youths during a trip to Witbank's 
Mooiloop township on Friday [28 January] morning. 
  But there was also a friendly welcoming from a quiet but 
curious crowd--mostly elderly folk and young children--who 
followed him on a short walkabout through the township and into 
a local spaza shop. 
  The protesters--who followed the De Klerk entourage at a 
distance -- toyi-toyied [protest danced] and whistled, shouting: 
"Hamba [go away] De Klerk," "This is our country--go away," and 
"This place belongs to Mandela." 
  Mr de Klerk gave a short speech in which he condemned 
political intolerance and criticised the pulling down of NP 
flags before his arrival in the township. 
  In the spaza shop, the last stop of Mr de Klerk's Mooiloop 
tour, the NP leader bought fruit gums for three young boys who 
had followed him into the premises. By this time the ANC 
supporters had grown into a noisy crowd and Mr de Klerk, looking 
calm, retreated to his armoured limo and left for the next stop 
-- Lynnville, another central Witbank township. 
  The trip to Hoalanikhale (Mooiloop) started with a visit to 
three men wearing men NP paper caps standing by their metal 
shanty. 
  Mr de Klerk spent some time speaking to them and addressing 
the crowd from their small yard. "Tonight they (the local NP 
supporters) die," an ANC supporter was heard to say. 
  An NP organiser said this was standard ANC reaction and that 
the party would rely on the local peace committee to help their 
supporters. 
  At Lynnville, Mr de Klerk made a short stop to visit Theresa 
Mathemba whose tiny quarters in a converted hostel was too 
cramped to allow reporters to enter.

  [Text] Witbank Jan 28 SAPA--Three black National Party [NP] 
supporters had to be removed from their home at the Hlalanikhale 
township, near Witbank, on Friday morning after they had 
welcomed State President F.W. de Klerk to their home. 
  Shortly after President de Klerk and his press and party 
entourage left the township, the men were stoned and security 
sources said they had been removed to safety while negotiations 
through the peace committee attempted to defuse the situation. 
  One of the victims was Mr Simon Maseko. All three men, 
wearing NP paper caps, were waiting for President de Klerk's 
arrival, and later spent some time talking to him before the NP 
leader addressed a gathering crowd, mostly hostile ANC [African 
National Congress] supporters. "They die tonight," one ANC 
supporter was heard to say.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  Natal </H6>
  Johannesburg SAPA in English at 0821 GMT on 27 January 
reports that "at least four more people have died violently in 
Natal, bringing the provincial toll to at least 29 since Friday 
last week, police said on Thursday. An unidentified man was 
shot and killed by gunmen when he resisted an attack in the 
Mtubatuba district of Mfekayi on the north coast on Wednesday 
afternoon. KwaZulu Police [KZP] said the motive for the killing 
was not known. Thomas Shongo, 26, was shot and killed while 
walking past the kwaMashu men's hostel, north of Durban, on 
Tuesday night. Less than an hour later, Ndukuzempi Mahlobo was 
shot and killed at the hostel by three gunmen. The KZP said he 
had apparently refused to participate in a strike. Edmond 
Mthethwa was shot and injured when he and a friend were driving 
through the Silverstream area of Kranskop in northern Natal on 
Tuesday." 
<H6>  East Rand </H6>
  Johannesburg SAPA in English at 1046 GMT on 27 January 
reports that "four men were killed on the East Rand on 
Wednesday, police reported. Two bodies were found with gunshot 
wounds in Katlehong and a third, so badly decomposed it could 
not be determined how the man had been killed, was found in veld 
near the Natalspruit railway station. Spokesman Lt Deon Peens 
said in a statement on Thursday police shot dead the fourth 
person when an Internal Stability Division foot patrol came 
under fire in Katlehong's Mokoena section. The patrol took 
possession of an AK-47 rifle and magazine and 30 rounds of 
ammunition." "On Tuesday, police said, Matheus Mnguni of 
Kwathema, Springs, was shot in the right arm and leg by gunmen."

  [Text] Ciskei soldiers involved in the September 1992 Bisho 
massacre will not be prosecuted for the time being. Ciskei 
Attorney General Willem Jurgens said he has decided to postpone 
any decision on whether to prosecute until Ciskei was 
reincorporated into South Africa, after the April general 
election. Mr. Jurgens' statement follows the Bisho Supreme 
Court's recent decision to overturn the ruling Military 
Council's decree indemnifying all the soldiers involved in the 
shooting of African National Congress protest marchers.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  TEC Takes Effective Control of Government Functions--"It is 
clear that the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] is taking 
over effective control of some government functions," notes the 
page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 27 
January. The TEC has "demanded the government suspend its 
planned salary increases for senior civil servants," despite the 
"objections of government members." THE CITIZEN fears the TEC 
"is going to act increasingly as if it is the government, and 
the government is going to be outvoted on major issues." 
President de Klerk is advised to tell his TEC members to "take 
a stronger line." "There is, after all, an election ahead of 
us, and the government, which is going to campaign to win, must 
be able to show that it is governing in the transition period -- 
and is strong enough to make its voice heard in a government of 
national unity. Chumminess or weakness is totally out of place 
in the run up to the election." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  South Africa-Frontline States Reconciliation--"This week 
Mugabe was gracious and warm in receiving President de Klerk and 
Nelson Mandela at the Gaborone mini-summit," points out a 
page-10 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 
January. The significance of the encounter "extends well beyond 
the formal reason for the calling of the meeting--the crisis in 
Lesotho. In effect it amounted to a historic act of 
reconciliation between South Africa and the Frontline states, of 
which Mugabe is the chairman. It also signaled South Africa's 
return to the regional fold, where it is bound to become a major 
power. Mugabe's generous acknowledgement of De Klerk's role in 
breaking the Republic's isolation was also revealing and might 
give some of the South African president's critics back at home 
food for thought." 
  Peacekeeping Force Commander Appointment `Mistake'--A second 
editorial on the same page finds the appointment of Brigadier 
Gabriel Ramushwana as commander of the National Peacekeeping 
Force to be "a mistake." Although Ramushwana is a "good 
soldier" he "fails" as a "man of unquestioned integrity." "He 
is alleged to have enriched himself at the expense of the Venda 
Pension Fund. The alleged self-enrichment took place while he 
was chairman of the Venda Military Council, meaning that he is 
suspected of abusing power for self-gain. Ramushwana may be 
innocent. He must not, however, be considered for high office 
until his name is cleared, the more so as his accusers are 
ordinary men and women in Venda, not rival politicians with 
suspect motives." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  S. Africa To Play New Regional Role--Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 28 January in a page-8 editorial believes 
South Africa is "taking its place in Africa and the world." The 
paper comments on President de Klerk's meeting with Nelson 
Mandela in Botswana in an effort to "end the military problem in 
Lesotho." "It was a brief meeting between the two South 
Africans, the presidents of Zimbabwe and Botswana and the deputy 
prime minister of Lesotho, but it was loaded with symbolism and 
promise. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe is current chairman 
of the Frontline States. He and Botswana President Quett Masire 
are prominent members of the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC), while both countries and Lesotho are members 
of the Commonwealth, whose secretariat was consulted. The 
regional linkages were clear, deliberate and relevant: South 
Africa was being asked by other African states to help resolve a 
regional problem." This first meeting between Mugabe and De 
Klerk "should presage more amicable relations, both now and 
after the April election. Doors are opening further afield, 
too: the next government will be invited to rejoin the 
Commonwealth and this week's events may help influence opinions 
on both sides." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Botswana Meeting Platform for De Klerk To Meet 
Mugabe--Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 January in a 
page-10 editorial says many people must be "disappointed at the 
outcome of the meeting" in Botswana between President Masire, 
President Mugabe and President de Klerk concerning Lesotho's 
military crisis. "Here were three presidents who listened to a 
presentation by Lesotho's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Selometse 
Baholo, and then appointed a task force to investigate the issue 
further. Why not act on the information provided by Baholo?" 
This "vacillation must stop if the Lesotho crisis is not to 
develop into a major regional crisis. Unless the purpose of the 
meeting was not to discuss Lesotho, but to provide a platform 
for F.W. de Klerk to meet Mugabe before his term expires. Which 
would be a pity, for people may have died in Lesotho and many 
more may die unless effective steps are taken now, which we urge 
the leaders of southern Africa to do without any more 
commissions and committees." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  SACP Lacks Separate Identity--Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN in English for 28 Jan-3 February in a page 14 editorial 
points out that the South African Communist Party (SACP) has 
named its members on the African National Congress (ANC) 
election list. "Ironically, this may be the end of the road for 
the SACP as a significant political force. Will it still have 
an identity separate and clear enough to make it a political 
force?" Its MPs "will be subject to ANC discipline and the 
orders of ANC parliamentary whips. If they vote against ANC 
orders, they will lose their seats. So, either the SACP goes 
along with the ANC on everything, or it will have to choose to 
go out in the wilderness -- a penniless, MP-less prospect for a 
party with only 60,000 members."

<F P=106> [Report by Arlit Khuri: "Unified Djibouti Opposition Calls </F>
for Toppling President Gouled's Regime"] 
  [Text] Paris--A the end of their second conference held in 
Addis Ababa 19-23 January, Djibouti opposition organizations 
called for toppling the regime of "dictator" President Hassan 
Gouled Aptidon, on the grounds that he is the "main obstacle to 
the establishment of peace, national reconciliation, and 
democracy in the country." 
  The organizations, which form the "Unified Djibouti 
Opposition Front," said in a statement that participants 
analyzed international and regional conditions as well as 
Djibouti conditions, which are characterized by "the continued 
liberation war against a dictatorship that is sacrificing the 
nation's present and future through forcible domination." 
  They added that the Djibouti regime has always rejected the 
peace and democracy proposals adopted by the Front's first 
conference, which was held in Paris in June 1992. They stressed 
that peace and democracy are still the Front's basic aims and 
that Gouled's regime represents the main obstacle to their 
achievement. 
  The organizations added that "Gouled insists on continuing 
the war despite the deterioration of the national economy and 
while government militias continue to commit inhumane practices, 
such as massacres and the daily torture of civilians." 
  They said that, on this basis, the "Unified Opposition 
Front" 
has decided to work to achieve the following aims: 
  "1. To topple Hassan Gouled Aptidon's dictatorship on the 
grounds that this is the only way to restore peace and 
democracy. It can be done in the following manner: 
  "To continue to reinforce armed struggle, which should 
expand to cover all national territory. 
  "To reinforce all forms of political and social struggle 
in the capital by mobilizing all groups of national society. 
  "2. To work -- after the dictatorship is toppled -- to form 
a 
transitional government, achieve national reconciliation, and 
set up the institutions of a rule-of-law state in Djibouti based 
on integration with the region's states." 
  The statement bears the signatures of Ahmed Dini Ahmed, 
leader of the "Front for the Restoration of Unity and 
Democracy"; Omar Khair, leader of the Democratic Forces Front; 
Mohamed Hussein Hassan, leader of the Djibouti National 
Movement; Djalal Abdel Rahman Ahmed, leader of the Movement for 
Salvation and Rebuilding; Mahdi Ibrahim Goud, official in charge 
of foreign relations in the Djibouti Democrats Union; Kamil Ali 
Mohamed, spokesman for parliamentary opposition; and Abdellahi 
Disingor, leader of the Democratic Socialist Union. 
  Meanwhile, the "Society for the Defense of Human Rights" in 
Djibouti has said that government forces have arrested 50 
civilians at random and put them in a prison situated some 60 km 
from the town of Tadjoura, north of the country. 
  The society said in a statement that Djibouti authorities 
are 
keeping silent about the fate of these detainees, who are 
suffering from the dreadful conditions in prison.

  [Excerpt] The Addis Ababa police today reported that 
unidentified gunmen fired three times at an American Embassy 
staff member while the diplomat was returning towards town from 
the Bole US AID offices. The police added that the embassy 
staff member who was attacked escaped unhurt, and that the 
criminals have not yet been apprehended. The police also noted 
that the shooting came from a Toyota Land Cruiser which was 
identical in make and color to the one belonging to the American 
Embassy staff member, had a diplomatic corps registration number 
of 04 Addis Ababa 60, and approached the left-hand side of the 
embassy staff member's car. Two of the three bullets fired 
penetrated the driver's door, and the two vehicles collided as a 
result. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, chairman of the Somali 
National Alliance [SNA] and the United Somali Congress [USC], 
congratulated the Somali people, particularly SNA supporters, on 
the occasion of the 26 January anniversary and the successive 
victories scored by the people in achieving their aim based on 
justice and coexistence. The SNA chairman began his speech by 
saying that 26 January is the third anniversary of the toppling 
of the dictatorial regime that misruled the Somali people for 
over 21 years. He said it is an occasion that the Somali people 
should mark and celebrate fully. 
  Mohamed Farah Aidid also took the opportunity to 
congratulate, with great confidence, fighters, heads of social 
organizations, all strugglers and SNA supporters wherever they 
may be, as well as other organizations which participated in the 
political and armed struggle. [passage omitted] 
  He said the struggle had brought about peace, justice, 
unity, 
progress, democracy, fraternity, respect for the Islamic 
religion, equality, and a revival of the Somali people's 
culture, customs, and history. [passage omitted] 
  Most noteworthy, Chairman Aidid said, are the victories 
achieved in the defense of the Somali people, spearheaded by SNA 
leaders, fighters, women, elders, youth organizations, 
intellectuals and politicians, as well as the Alliance's 
supporters. He added that in the defense struggle, the 
unprovoked UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] attacks against the 
Somali people have been countered. 
  He said UNOSOM-II's aim was colonialism, the massacre of 
people, and the destruction of private and national assets. The 
colonialists employed the most highly sophisticated weapons, be 
they on the ground or air, and an estimated 13,000 people, 
including children, women, and the elderly, were killed over a 
five month period and twice that number were injured. Apart 
from the deaths and injuries, private and national assets were 
destroyed. And although assessment is being carried out to 
determine the extent of destruction of these assets, the losses 
have run into the millions of dollars. 
  Aidid said the world was surprised and still is surprised at 
how UNOSOM turned its humanitarian program into the aforesaid 
activities. The world is of the opinion that the Somali 
people's dignity, independence, and nationhood have been 
disregarded. As the Somali people responded to the aggression, 
a lot of comments were made, and the strugglers who defended 
Somali dignity and nationhood were recognized as heroes who 
became the symbols and defenders of human rights, peace, and 
international progress. 
  The Somali people within and outside the country are united 
in the claim that the SNA strugglers are the only people who 
defended the Somali people's honor and nationhood and brought 
home tangible victory. All the leaders of the countries of the 
world and their peoples share the SNA's view. The SNA's 
reputation is very high, and therefore it always deserves full 
commemoration on every occasion. Somalia is also defending the 
dignity and independence of Third World countries and those who 
believe in peace and progress. Aidid said UNOSOM should 
compensate the Somali people for the destruction of property and 
life as such steps could heal wounds and promote peace and 
reestablishment of cordial relations between the inflicters of 
the damage and the victims. 
  We call on all Somali people, Mohamed Farah Aidid said, to 
learn from the problems brought upon them and the misrule by the 
successor regime ever since they attained independence. It is 
imperative for the Somali people to attain unity, peace, and 
progress and to build a new Somalia where stability and respect 
for each other's rights, cooperation and brotherhood and 
consultation are practiced. He called on the Somali people to 
forget their differences and instead turn to the only way, that 
of defending their dignity and newly written history which is in 
their favor. Aidid said we should remember the strugglers of 
various ages who died bravely in the defense of Somali dignity 
and sovereignty. [passage omitted] 
  Aidid said the Somali people should assist the injured, 
orphaned, and refugees, wherever they may be. Aidid said we are 
obliged to thank those governments and international 
organizations who provided the Somali people with humanitarian 
aid during the worst times when the Somali people were faced 
with hunger and starvation. He said we have expressed our 
profound gratitude to the neighboring governments that welcomed 
and hosted Somali refugees, and we would like to tell these 
governments that we will reciprocate in a similar way.

  [Text] Kampala, Jan 27 (AFP)--Somali warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid arrived in the Ugandan city of Entebbe on Thursday [27 
January] for talks with President Yoweri Museveni, officials 
said. 
  Aidid left the Kenyan capital, Nairobi earlier Thursday. He 
had been in Kenya since UN-sponsored peace talks in Addis Ababa 
collapsed last month. 
  Efforts to open Kenyan-brokered negotiations in Nairobi 
between Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) and the Group of 
12 factions led by his enemy, self-styled interim president Ali 
Mahdi Mohamed, met with little success, according to Somali 
sources. 
  Aidid was expected to spend a few days in Uganda before 
returning to Mogadishu via Nairobi. 
  He had planned to return to the Somali capital this weekend, 
but changed his plans when Museveni agreed to receive him in 
Entebbe, a source close to the warlord said.

  [Text] The Parliament has expressed concern about the 
worsening relationship between Ghana and Togo. While some 
members called for stern measures against Togo, others urged the 
government to exercise restraint. This is because any war will 
result in the destruction of lives and property. This followed 
a statement by the member for Hoehoe-South, Mr. Koffi Kedem, at 
today's sitting of the house in Accra. The statement called for 
a quick and resolute response from the government for the 
crimes, unwarranted murders, and flagrant violation of the 
country's territory by Togo. They invited the minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, to brief parliament on the 
situation.

  [Text] State governments have been asked to stop further 
arrest and detention of legislators under the last civilian 
administration. A statement from the office of the chief of 
general staff says the legislators could be allowed to repay the 
loans in accordance with the terms of payment entered into when 
such loans were obtained. The government also directed 
administrators to ensure that public funds were no longer 
deposited with finance houses. Instead central banks should be 
used for that purpose. 
  Meanwhile, deposits by prospective candidates for the 
abortive 1993 local government elections are to be refunded. A 
directive to that effect from the presidency in Abuja asked 
state administrators to ascertain the amount the politicians 
spent on the abortive elections and where the money was 
deposited. They are also to identify bona fide candidates and 
make arrangements for their refund.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 27 Jan (AFP)--Today, more than 50 
deputies from the presidential camp and the opposition stemming 
from four southern regions of Congo created an "interregional 
committee" charged with achieving peace because "certain 
elements of the security forces and armed groups of the 
political coalitions are sowing terror" among the citizens. 
  Government radio reported that the committee of deputies was 
set up following a meeting of representatives from the main 
opposition party, the Congolese Movement for Democracy and 
Integral Development [MCDDI] of Bernard Kolelas, and President 
Pascal Lissouba's party, and the Pan-African Union for Social 
Democracy, UPADES. 
  The MCDDI activists are mostly from the Pool Region, around 
the capital, while those from UPADES are from the regions of 
Niari, Bouenza, and Lekoumou. The committee, which is headed by 
Simon Diassakoula, an MCDDI deputy, is charged with initiating 
peace efforts in the four regions and the capital, where their 
citizens are fighting in the southern district. 
  Those regions were affected by acts of violence, mainly in 
June and July 1994 during the first round of the early 
legislative elections, which were challenged by the opposition. 
At least 30 people were reportedly killed during those events. 
In Brazzaville, about 115 deaths were reported in the fighting, 
which took place from mid-December 1993 to early January between 
the militias of the opposition and presidential camp.

their implementation. The government and the mediator support 
the implementation of the Bicesse Accord and say that UNITA will 
have [words indistinct] legislation. UNITA continues to be 
intransigent, however, demanding an equal percentage in the

  [Text] Pretoria Jan 27 SAPA--Trilateral talks involving the 
government, the African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom 
Alliance will continue on Monday after a successful session in 
Pretoria ended on Thursday [27 January] night. The negotiators 
have given themselves an extra three days to resolve a number of 
outstanding constitutional issues. 
  The extension results from "technical problems" that have 
delayed the promulgation of the election expected on Friday. 
ANC negotator Mohammed Valli Moosa said the problems had 
nothing to do with the discussions involving the Alliance. 
  Mr Valli Moosa said the ANC had given the Alliance a set of 
proposals which took into account most of its legitimate 
demands. The alliance wanted until Monday to take the proposals 
back to its principals. 
  He said there was a possibility that the Alliance would 
accept the interim constitution even at this late stage. "The 
talks did not break down. Our proposals were not rejected out of 
hand. That indicates that the show is still on the road," Mr 
Valli Moosa said. 
  He said the ANC's proposals were an attempt to come to terms 
with Alliance concerns about regional constitutional and fiscal 
powers. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the ANC 
and the Alliance remained at odds about the extent of powers of 
regional governments. He said talks had also been held with a 
kwaZulu royal delegation and that these could lead to a 
constitutional amendment involving the position of traditional 
leadership. 
  The talks with the royal delegation and other talks with the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [AFV, Afrikaner National Front] were not 
necessarily interrelated, but the trilateral negotiators had 
taken note of earlier discussions on a Afrikaner volkstaat 
[homeland], he added. But the volkstaat issue had not been 
resolved, and a new hitch on the volkstaat issue had arisen, Mr 
Meyer said. 
  AFV leader Gen Constand Viljoen left the meeting reportedly 
on his way to the Bophutatswana Embassy in Pretoria, where 
Alliance leaders were waiting to be briefed on the 
constitutional proposals presented by the ANC. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reported this could be an indication that the Alliance was 
considering the proposals seriously.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The town of Bimbila, near Tamale, in northern 
Ghana, has become a no-go area for police. It is a region 
bedeviled by ethnic clashes. A government mediating team has 
been touring the north for some weeks trying to cool things 
down, but, at Bimbila, local people turned on police after a 
truck carrying ammunition was seized. From Tamale, our reporter 
Adama Eliasu telexed this report: [read by announcer] 
  Last Tuesday [25 January], a group of people at Bimbila in 
the northern region attacked and wounded security personnel and 
burned down the police station, as well as the residence of the 
assistant superintendent of police. The trouble broke out after 
a vehicle carrying ammunition was intercepted by security 
personnel. It is illegal to carry arms and ammunition in the 
area because of the longstanding tribal tensions there. 
  Tuesday's attack resulted in six policemen and two soldiers 
being seriously injured. A police source told me the injuries 
happened when a mob forcibly freed the vehicle after it was 
seized and took away the ammunition. The mob then also stole 
four rifles and a pistol from the police. According to the 
police source, when the vehicle carrying the ammunition was 
impounded, the local Ghana Private Road Transport Union [GPRTU] 
chairman, Mr. Pantina Dawuni, intervened and insisted that the 
vehicle and its ammunition be released or else there would be 
trouble. The GPRTU chairman then mobilized people armed with 
cudgels and offensive weapons, who attacked the police at the 
(Pandi)-Bimbila barrier, where the vehicle was intercepted. The 
chairman then mobilized another group to attack the police 
station and burn it down. The crowd then invaded the police 
superintendent's residence and seized about 200 guns, which the 
police had taken over the last 10 years. 
  A detachment of 76 policemen from Tamale, Sunyani, and 
Kumasi 
-- dispatched to Bimbila to maintain law and order -- have now 
been refused entry. Pantina Dawuni has sent a message to the 
divisional headquarters at Yendi, 43 miles from Bimbila, warning 
of an inevitable confrontation if the police dare to enter the 
town. A police source said that to avoid a bloodbath, they were 
temporarily staying away to allow members of the Northern 
Regional Security Committee and parliamentarians of the area to 
go as peacebrokers. Meanwhile, the 6th Battalion of Infantry, 
stationed at Tamale, have been put on the alert and they will 
move in if the situation demands it.

  [Text] Beijing, December 31 (XINHUA) -- Organizations from 
the mainland and Taiwan have agreed to form a basic framework 
for an agreement on hijackers' repatriation across the Taiwan 
Straits. 
  Officials from the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the mainland and the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan agreed to hold further talks as soon 
as possible to negotiate the repatriation of hijackers so as to 
reach a formal agreement. 
  A senior official from ARATS told XINHUA today that the 
negotiations between the two sides from December 18 to 22 in 
Taipei had made major progress as the two sides have achieved 
important common ground and formed a basic framework for the 
agreement on repatriation of hijackers. Airliner hijacking has 
become a serious problem since early this year. 
  The two sides agreed in principle that hijackers must be 
repatriated and punished severely, as hijacking civil airliners 
is a serious criminal activity. 
  The framework of the repatriation agreement involves the 
scope of repatriation, principle of repatriation, coercive 
measures and the way of repatriation and hand-over, according to 
the official. 
  The planned agreement applies to persons from both sides of 
the Taiwan Straits who hijack civil aircraft to the other side. 
  The official said that although exact wording of the 
agreement is to be further discussed, Mazu and Mawei ports will 
be the places for handover and Jinmen and Xiamen may also be 
possible venues for it.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- The departments 
concerned in Taiwan recently have said that aircraft hijackers 
will be punished. Liu Baocai and Huang Shugang, who hijacked a 
plane to Taiwan in April, have been sentenced to 10 years in 
prison; other hijackers are being tried. [the XINHUA

beginning of the item, as follows: [Text] According to Taiwan

follows at this point: ...residence in Taiwan. [new paragraph] 
  [Since the first airliner was hijacked to Taiwan, the Taiwan 
public has showed deep concern, saying that all hijackers should 
be repatriated to the mainland and those who used violence, 
coercion, and other means to hijack aircraft should be sentenced 
to death or life imprisonment without probation in accordance 
with relevant regulations. [new paragraph] 
  [It is reported that on 18 December, Ye Jinfeng.... (adding 
paragraph, rephrasing)] On 18 December, Ye Jinfeng [Yeh 
Chin-feng], vice chairman of Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs 
Council," said that if the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Straits and the Straits Exchange Foundation reach 
agreement on the question of the repatriation of hijackers from 
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the 12 mainland hijackers who 
are currently detained in Taiwan will be repatriated to the 
mainland according to the principle of "taking into account past 
misdeeds." [the XINHUA replacement version renders the previous 
sentence as follows: ...according to the principle of 
"retroactivity." (rephrasing)] 
  It has also been learned that Gao Jun, who hijacked a plane 
to Taiwan on 8 December, has been in a state of depression 
during his confinement in a jail in Taoyuan. He attempted 
suicide on the morning of 23 December, but his attempt failed.

  [Text] Beijing, December 31 (XINHUA) -- Two hijackers, Liu 
Baocai and Huang Shugang, who hijacked a Chinese mainland 
airliner to Taiwan in April 1993, have been sentenced to a 
10-year term of imprisonment respectively in Taiwan, according 
to Taiwan press reports. 
  According to the reports, all other mainland hijackers are 
still under trial and they are prohibited to apply for permanent 
stay in Taiwan. 
  Since the first mainland airliner was hijacked to Taiwan 
this 
year, the Taiwan public has showed deep concern, saying that all 
hijackers should be repatriated to the mainland and those who 
employed violent and coercive and other means to hijack aircraft 
should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without 
probation in accordance with relevant regulations. 
  On December 18 this year, a vice-chairman of the "Mainland 
Affairs Council" of Taiwan had expressed the view that all 12 
hijackers staying in Taiwan would be repatriated if the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits from the 
mainland and the Straits Exchange Foundation from Taiwan reached 
an agreement on this issue. 
  It is also reported that Gao Jun, who hijacked a Chinese 
mainland airliner to Taiwan on December 8 this year, had 
attempted to kill himself on early December 23 in a jail. Local 
reports said he has been in low spirits there.

  [Text] Beijing, Dec 31 (AFP) -- If some of those behind 
the 10 hijackings to Taiwan this year had political motives, one 
Chinese man said he was trying to flee poverty, the Press Digest 
said in its latest edition received here Friday. 
  "We are so poor it's better if I try to hijack a plane to 
Taiwan," Gao Guangkai told his mother before making his failed 
attempt on November 26 to hijack a flight between the eastern 
city of Nanjing and Fuzhou. Gao, 29, is from a family of five 
children living in a village in the underdeveloped eastern 
province of Anhui. He was a temporary sawmill worker, the 
newspaper said. 
  The plane, which Gao threatened to blow up with a bomb 
concealed in his travel bag, finally landed at the airport in 
Hangzhou, 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Nanjing. Gao was 
quickly apprehended by police. Gao's bag did not contain 
explosives, only a few personal effects and 26 yuan (four 
dollars), the newspaper said. 
  Ten Chinese planes were hijacked to Taiwan in 1993, although 
there were two other known attempts. The hijackers face lengthy 
prison terms in Taiwan and officials there refuse to return them 
to the mainland as demanded by Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] sent a letter today 
to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], welcoming plans 
by SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary General Jiao Renhe to visit 
Beijing in mid January. 
  In reply to an SEF letter inviting a suitable ARATS official 
to visit Taiwan for a "face-to-face consultation on SEF-ARATS 
affairs," ARATS on 20 December sent a letter to the SEF, 
expressing consent. However, in its second letter to ARATS dated 
23 December, the SEF said it was unable to go proceed with the 
invitation and expressed the hope that a responsible SEF 
official might visit Beijing for consultations. 
  In today's reply letter to SEF, ARATS said: The talks on the 
basis of the "ARATS-SEF Agreement on the System of Mutual 
Contact and Talks" held between responsible ARATS and SEF 
officials are conducive to further expanding ARATS-SEF 
cooperation, to implementing the results of the Wang-Gu meeting, 
and to promoting the development of cross-strait relations. 
Therefore, it is appropriate to hold the talks in either Taibei 
[Taipei] or Beijing. In view of the fact that it is 
inconvenient for SEF to proceed with its invitation, ARATS is 
willing to adhere to its original plan to welcome Mr. Jiao Renhe 
to Beijing after 15 January at a time to be agreed by both 
sides, to hold face-to-face consultations on a meeting between 
Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] and on 
ARATS-SEF affairs, and to exchange views on matters of mutual 
interest.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
Saturday [1 January] called on Beijing authorities to ease 
hostility toward Taiwan and work for nurturing mutual 
understanding and trust in order to create a "win-win" situation 
of mutual benefit and reciprocity. 
  "Only in this way can the reunification of China bring good 
fortune, happiness and glory to the Chinese people," Li said in 
his New Year's message delivered in a grand ceremony at the 
presidential office marking the beginning of the 83rd year of 
the Republic of China [ROC]. 
  "We clearly understand that the greatest problem between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait is the lack of genuine mutual 
understanding. The two sides interact, but their is no mutual 
trust," the president said. 
  "Therefore," Li said, "we sincerely call upon the Chinese 
Communist authorities to attach great importance to the welfare 
of the people on both sides of the strait, renounce their 
hostile and confrontational attitude, cherish the brotherhood of 
people on both sides, and work toward nurturing mutual 
understanding and trust in the new year." 
  Li also called on people here to strive for greater 
achievements in the new year so that the Chinese nation can be 
really proud of itself in the 21st century. 
  "Even though this is a year most full of hope for us, it is 
also a year in which we must struggle most," Li said. 
  He emphasized the importance of seeking a significant 
breakthrough in economic development. "The strength nurtured by 
our economic development has allowed us to improve the life of 
our citizenry and stand firmly in the international community," 
the president noted. 
  Li said the government has introduced a set of stimulus 
measures designed to resolve the problem of slackening economic 
growth. The measures include increasing spending on public 
works, encouraging private investment and promoting the building 
of an operational center for the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Li also pledged to expand Taiwan's foreign relations, 
saying, 
"we will expand our participation in international activities, 
fulfill our obligations to the international community, win 
international goodwill and develop practical relations, all for 
the purpose of building up the international status due us." 
  Li described 1994 as the year when people here must further 
advance Chinese culture with new vigor. "At a time when the ROC 
is achieving outstanding successes, both politically and 
economically, we must make greater efforts to raise the quality 
of our spiritual life and make progress in our cultural life." 
  On the third-phase constitutional reform, Li said, "it will 
have to take into account the collective wisdom and the 
consensus of the people, the fundamental framework of the 
five-power Constitution, the present state of our constitutional 
development and the future needs of national unification." 
  Li concluded by saying that the longer term welfare of the 
public demands the joint concern of everyone, and a promising 
future for our national demands the joint efforts of all to help 
set in motion.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) -- After an ideological and 
substantive separation of more than four decades, Taiwan and 
Mainland China found in 1993 that the two sides were finally 
ready to meet at the negotiation table. 
  Since C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits 
Exchange 
Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), met 
April 27-29 in Singapore for the first "direct formal" talks 
between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland since 1949, three other 
SEF-ARATS "business" talks have taken place. 
  The three "business" meetings were held in August, November, 
and December in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei respectively. 
  Although the talks did not result in any definite 
agreements, 
the two sides arrived at a consensus that a negotiation channel 
for direct talks between the two semi-official intermediary 
organizations had been established. 
  During the three-day "Koo-Wang" talks in April, the two 
organizations signed four agreements, including the agreement on 
the establishment of systematic liaison and communication 
channels between SEF and ARATS which stipulates that SEF and 
ARATS officials at the level of deputy secretary-general or 
department director should hold talks every three months on 
either side of the Taiwan strait. 
  Under the Koo-Wang talks joint accord, the two sides were to 
hold talks during 1993 on such issues as repatriation of illegal 
immigrants, fishing disputes, crackdown on crimes on the sea, 
judicial assistance, and intellectual property rights protektion. 
  With a communication mechanism linking SEF and ARATS 
established by the "Koo-Wang" talks, SEF and ARATS officials met 
three times in 1993, but all talks ended without agreement. 
  Even though "official" relations between the two sides made 
little progress, private ties, especially two-way trade, 
continued to grow during the past year. 
  According to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) statistics, 
indirect two-way trade between Taiwan and the mainland reached 
US$6.39 billion in the Jan-Sept period last year, up 21.2 
percent from US$5.28 billion in the same period of 1992. 
  In terms of civilian visits, 1993 saw a faster growth for 
the 
mainland than Taiwan, MAC said. 
  Mainland residents made 16,000 visits to Taiwan during the 
first 10 months of 1993, up 36.96 percent from the corresponding 
period of 1992. Taiwan residents, meanwhile, paid 1,230,000 
visits to the mainland, compared with 1,280,000 visits 
registered a year earlier, MAC statistics showed. 
  During the past year, a MAC official said, a "white paper" 
published by Beijing in August concerning its relations with 
Taiwan was an undeniable setback in the course of cross-strait 
relations. 
  A spate of 10 hijackings in 1993 also had an adverse effect 
on the development of cross-Taiwan strait relations, the 
official remarked. 
  Nevertheless, MAC, SEF, and all related government agencies 
have determined to try harder in the next years to reach the 
goal of final reunification of China, said MAC Spokesman Kao 
Koong-lien.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
customs, agriculture, economics and industry officials will meet 
Wednesday [5 January] to discuss tariff concessions to the 
United States. 
  The meeting was called by Director-General Huang Yen-chao of 
the Board of Foreign Trade on Monday. Huang said he will invite 
officials from the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration 
Department, Council of Agriculture, and the Industrial 
Development Bureau to work out guidelines for tariff concessions 
and discuss rates for import tariff cuts. 
  On Nov. 24, 1993, the United States demanded ROC authorities 
slash tariffs on 699 U.S. imports. The ROC could not meet the 
U.S. deadline, and officials from the two sides agreed to meet 
in Washington on Jan. 19-20 for tariff negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, Economics Minister P.K. Chiang plans to convene 
an 
intra-ministerial meeting on Jan. 13 to discuss protection of 
intellectual proierty rights (IPR). 
  Chiang said the U.S. might hold unofficial discussions on 
the 
IPR issue with ROC delegates during the Washington negotiations. 
He hopes that the ROC delegation can convince their American 
counterparts about the ROC's determination to guarantee IPR 
protection in Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu did not comment Friday [31 December] on news reports 
that Lesotho has broken diplomatic ties with the Republic of 
China [ROC]. 
  Chien said he has received no reports about the matter from 
the Lesotho Government or from ROC diplomatic workers stationed 
in the African nation. 
  Chien admitted, however, that the ROC Government has tried 
its best to improve relations with the new Lesotho government 
which took the power in April this year after a general election. 
  "Pitifully, the efforts were made in vain," he said. 
  Lesotho resumed diplomatic relations with the Republic of 
China and broke ties with Beijing in April 1990. After that 
time, Chien said Beijing officials maintained contacts with and 
extended financial aid to exiled parliamentarians from the 
Basotho Congressional Party (BCP) there. 
  The return of exiled BCP parliamentarians and losses 
suffered 
by pro-ROC lawmakers in April 1993 elections resulted in the 
abrupt change in Lesotho's political stage this year, Chien 
explained. 
  Meanwhile, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) 
reported Thursday that Lesotho's break in diplomatic relations 
with the ROC was caused by an alleged attempt by two ROC 
citizens to bribe two Lesotho cabinet ministers. 
  Chien called the report "groundless." 
  However, Chien explained that the ROC Government contributed 
financial aid to Lesotho, Swaziland and Malawi last year when 
the three African countries were hard hit by drought.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu said Saturday [1 January] that Lesotho has not yet 
announced its decision to break diplomatic ties with the 
Republic of China [ROC]. 
  Chien said it was South African, not Lesotho's, news media 
which first reported that the southern African country has 
decided to sever its diplomatic ties with the ROC. 
  "We have ordered our embassy in South Africa to check the 
source of the report," Chien said. 
  The South African Broadcasting Corporation reported Thursday 
that Lesotho has becided to cut its diplomatic ties with the ROC 
because two ROC citizens had attempted to bribe two Lesotho 
cabinet ministers. 
  "The report was unfounded," Chien noted. 
  "We extended financial aid to Lesotho last year when the 
nation was hard hit by drought," Chien explained. "Such aid 
should not be interpreted as bribe," he added.

  [Text] Johannesburg, Jan. 2 (CNA) -- The Republic of China

surplus of US$623 million during the period, the official noted. 
  The official added that the ROC's booming trade with South 
Africa was not affected by the 1993 lifting of a world trade 
embargo placed on the country and he predicted an expansion in 
overall economic and trade relations between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Achievements in China, Happiness in </F>
the World"] 
  [Text] Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a New Year's 
speech to be broadcast worldwide over the China Radio 
International tonight, extends his warm greetings to all friends 
of China and especially to compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and 
Taiwan. 
  Expressing his sincere wishes for achievements and happiness 
in the coming year, the Chinese leader points out that 1993 has 
been a year of success for the Chinese people. 
  "We have seized opportunity, deepened our reforms under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line," Jiang 
says, adding that great progress has also been made in 
establishing a socialist market system, as formulated by the 
14th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. 
  China is now enjoying a period of economic growth, political 
stability, national unity and social progress, Jiang says, 
adding that the policy formulated by the Party and government to 
develop the economy has proved to be correct. 
  Though China still faces new challenges as she marches 
ahead, 
she is determined and confident about overcoming all the 
obstacles, the Chinese leader tells listeners around the globe. 
  "We begin the new year and face the future with greater 
confidence and enthusiasm." 
  Looking ahead to China s tasks in the coming year, Jiang 
says 
that building socialism with Chinese characteristics demands 
adherence to the policy of reforms and opening up to the outside 
world, because "this is the only way to build a modern socialist 
China, and transform our motherland into a strong, prosperous, 
democratic and civilized country." 
  The whole Chinese nation hopes to rapidly transform China 
into a prosperous land, free from poverty and backwardness, 
Jiang stresses in his speech, adding, "We are an Asian country 
with 5,000 years of history and a population of 1.1 billion 
citizens. A prosperous and strong China will not only 
contribute to the happiness of the Chinese people, but also to 
all of humanity." 
  China's stability and development cannot be separated from 
peace, development and prosperity throughout the world. 
  "This relationship is obvious to most of you, I am sure," 
says Jiang. 
  Turning to the international situation the Chinese leader 
cites the accelerated process of multi-polarism and the popular 
wish for co-operation and relaxation of tension. 
  He points out, however, that the Earth is still far from 
peaceful. "The contradictions in some areas have intensified, 
resulting in turmoil and armed conflict. Hegemonism and power 
politics are still a big problem, challenging world peace and 
development." 
  Under these circumstance, the Chinese Government and people 
firmly adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and 
have contributed to world peace and development, he points out. 
  Noting that China's international prestige has risen 
remarkably, the Chinese President says, "We have friends all 
over the world." 
  China will never seek hegemony, he goes on, and its 
development will not constitute a threat to any country. Jiang 
pledges that China will continue to develop friendly and 
co-operative relations with other countries on the basis of the 
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. 
  "It is the sacred mission of the whole Chinese people 
including our Taiwan compatriots to complete the unification of 
the motherland. Unification is also the way China's history is 
going. 
  "People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are longing for 
this. Any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one 
Taiwan," and "one China, two governments," goes against the 
aspirations and fundamental interests of people on both sides of 
the Taiwan Straits. 
  "It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities take all this 
into consideration, put national interests above all, strive to 
unify the motherland and, together with the mainland create a 
more prosperous China," Jiang says. 
  In the speech, the Chinese President notes that the dates 
when Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland are 
approaching. 
  Due to the fact that the British side persists in its wrong 
stand on the Hong Kong issue, the Sino-British talks on Hong 
Kong have broken. This is something that the Chinese Government 
did not want to see. 
  "But no matter what happens, we share the feelings and 
aspirations of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. Our 
policy of 'one country, two systems' will not change, our 
principal stand of adhering to the Basic Law on Hong Kong will 
not change, and our resolution to restore China's sovereignty 
over Hong Kong will not change. 
  "We are fully confident that we have the ability to keep 
Hong 
Kong prosperous and stable for a long time to come." 
  Jiang invites more overseas friends and compatriots to visit 
China in the coming year. 
  Quoting an old Chinese proverb, "It is better to see once 
than hear a hundred times," Jiang notes that 1994 is the 45th 
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. 
  "In the coming year, we invite all of you to come to China 
and see for yourselves. Such contacts will promote mutual 
understanding, trust and friendship." 
  Jiang concludes his speech by wishing his listeners around 
the world very Happy New Year.

<F P=106> ["Li Peng on Situation China Will Be Facing in Foreign </F>
Relations This Year, and the Issues of Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan": Report on interview with PRC Premier Li Peng by XINHUA 
reporter Zhou Shuchuan (0719 2885 2504) at Li's Zhongnanhai 
office; date note given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- China's foreign 
relations will be further expanded, the country is expecting a 
remarkable development of its relations with Europe as a whole, 
and new progress will possibly be made in the development of 
Sino-U.S. relations, the Chinese State Council Premier Li Peng 
said a few days ago, when making an analysis of the 
international situation and elaborating on the development trend 
of China's foreign relations. 
  In an interview with a XINHUA reporter, Li said: The year 
1994 will be the third year since the end of the Cold War. 
Generally speaking, on the one hand, the international 
situation is tending toward relaxation and the world is 
accelerating its pace toward multipolarization. On the other 
hand, however, the world still faces many unstable factors, and 
the problems related to the two major concerns -- peace and 
development -- have yet to be solved. 
  He pointed out that Asia, especially the East Asian region, 
has remained relatively stable and has been enjoying sustained 
economic growth amid this turbulent world. This is an important 
special characteristic of the current international situation, 
and it can be expected that East Asia's position and influence 
in the world will be further strengthened in the coming year, he 
stated. 
  By the same token, he said, one can expect the further 
upgrading of China's international standing and the further 
expansion of its foreign relations. Speaking specifically, 
remarkable development can be expected in the overall relations 
between China and European countries, and as the Sino-U.S. 
summit has offered an opportunity for improvement in bilateral 
ties, new progress possibly will be made in Sino-U.S. relations. 
Facts have shown that there are broad, common interests in the 
relations between China and Western countries which form the 
basis of the relations between the two sides. 
  Li Peng expressed his wishes on the issues of Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan. He said: As the year 1994 is coming, the 
dates for the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland 
are drawing nearer and nearer. No matter what happens, we are 
capable of resuming the exercise of China's sovereignty over 
Hong Kong as scheduled, while upholding the principle of "one 
country, two systems" and the principles already laid down in 
the Basic Law, and also is capable of maintaining long-term 
stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Now that Hong Kong and 
Macao are closely linked with the China mainland economically, 
the two cities will enjoy greater economic prosperity in the 
wake of the economic development of the mainland. 
  Peaceful reunification of the motherland is a predominant 
trend and is in line with the popular will, Li added. To be 
sure, some people are still attempting to fabricate "two 
China's," "one China and one Taiwan," or "one country, two 
governments," all of which run counter to the historical trend 
and are contrary to the common aspiration and fundamental 
interests of the Chinese people on both shores of the Taiwan 
Strait. We hope the Taiwan authorities will place national 
interests first, and will do more practical work to contribute 
to the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. 
  Li Peng said: I believe that the vast number of Taiwan 
compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and overseas 
Chinese -- all of whom are the descendants of the Chinese nation 
-- share a common aspiration for the prosperity of the Chinese 
nation, and all of us should continue to work together to 
achieve this goal in the new year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng 
predicted that in the year 1994, China will expand its relations 
with foreign countries, make "marked progress" in improving its 
relations with the European countries and achieve "fresh 
progress" in Sino-U.S. ties. 
  In an interview with XINHUA over the weekend, Premier Li 
analyzed the international situation and spoke on China's 
relations with other countries and its policies towards Hong 
Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  He noted that in 1994, the third year following the end of 
the Cold War, the international situation would go towards 
relaxation, with the world moving more rapidly to 
multi-polarization. 
  But on the other side, he warned, there are still many 
destabilizing factors in the world, and the two main themes, 
peace and development, remain unsettled. 
  He continued that in today's turbulent world, Asia, and east 
Asia in particular, remains relatively stable and its economy is 
growing continuously. 
  He described this phenomenon as "an important feature of the 
world situation today" and predicted that east Asia will 
continue to improve its standing and have a greater influence on 
the whole world in the new year. 
  Li was also confident that China will improve its 
international standing and further expand its relations 
world-wide in 1994. 
  He believed that China will make marked improvement in its 
relations with the European countries as a group. 
  The Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last November provided a 
good 
opportunity for the improvement of bilateral ties, Li said, 
adding that it is possible that such ties will see new 
development in the new year. 
  "Facts show that there exist wide-ranging common interests 
between China and the Western countries, which form the basis 
for improving Sino-Western relations," Li stressed. 
  The premier said that 1994 brings China nearer to recovering 
its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. 
  No matter what happens, he said, the Chinese Government has 
the ability to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong as 
scheduled, uphold the "one country, two systems" policy and the 
Basic Law for Hong Kong and maintain long-term stability and 
prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  Hong Kong and Macao are more closely connected with the 
mainland economically, he noted, adding that the continuous 
economic development in the mainland will ensure increasing 
prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao. 
  Premier Li continued that the peaceful reunification of 
China 
is the general trend of historical development and a popular 
wish of all the Chinese people. 
  The attempt by some people to create "two Chinas," or "one 
China, one Taiwan," or "one country, two governments," runs 
counter to the development of history and to the fundamental 
interests and wishes of the people on the mainland and in 
Taiwan, Li said. 
  He called on the Taiwan authorities to place the interests 
of 
the Chinese nation above everything else and do more practical 
things for the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. 
  In conclusion, Premier Li urged all the Chinese in Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, Macao, the Overseas Chinese and those Chinese 
residing abroad to work for the prosperity of the Chinese nation.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504): "Li Peng </F>
Looks At the Prospects for the General Trend of China's Reform 
in 1994"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA)--Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
in an interview with this reporter at the turn of 1994, said 
that this year China will take a number of major reform steps, 
which will be prudent and steady. 
  Li Peng gave the interview in his Zhongnanhai office. He 
outlined the trend in China's economic development for 1994 in 
two sentences: "Reform will push ahead with major steps. The 
economy will develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner." 
  He said: Specifically, the major reform steps will come in 
establishing the modern enterprise system and a restructuring of 
the finance, tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade 
fields. All these will be oriented to building a socialist 
market economy. 
  The State Council has proposed setting this year's economic 
growth rate at 9 percent, lower than that of last year, he said. 
  With two successive years of high growth, some sectors of 
the 
economy are considerably burdened, with such "bottlenecks" as 
energy and communications presenting greater restrictions on 
economic growth. A relatively relaxed environment is necessary 
for sustained economic growth, he said. 
  As compared with the economic growth rates in other 
countries 
in the world, 9 percent still represents a rather high growth 
rate. There may be many interpretations of "healthy development" 
but, for the present, it should primarily be defined as 
improvement of industrial structure and enhancement of economic 
efficiency, he said. 
  During the nearly 90-minute interview, Li went to great 
lengths to expound the policy of price reform, saying that this 
will be in coordination with reforms in other fields, with the 
goal of keeping the price system in line with the rules of the 
market. Price reform must be carried out in a positive and 
prudent way, he said. 
  In the past decade and more, China has taken major steps to 
reform the price system and has freed the prices of most 
commodities as planned, accumulating a wealth of experience. So 
far, 90 percent of commodities are regulated by the market, with 
only the prices of a small number of commodities which have a 
direct bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood, 
still under state control. 
  The small number of commodities is mostly from the basic 
industries. The unreasonably low prices of these commodities 
have encouraged consumption and prevented the relevant 
industries from being developed. Readjusting these prices will 
involve greater difficulties, Li said. For example, the oil 
industry could not possibly be developed without readjustment of 
oil prices but the readjustment of oil prices would certainly 
affect the prices of oil products. So, we must readjust the 
prices step by step and in a very prudent manner. 
  As China's markets are not yet fully fledged, a spontaneous 
and blind tendency tends to develop in the market. It is 
necessary for the state to practice macroeconomic control at the 
right time to protect the interests of the general public, he 
said. 
  With every major reform measure we will take into account 
the 
capacity to bear of the country, enterprises, and people and 
adhere to the principle of step by step. If we take too drastic 
measures, they will certainly affect enterprise production costs 
and the people's livelihood. 
  Li referred to the recent price fluctuation of grain in 
certain regions, which he said arose from a variety of reasons. 
  As the government has sufficient grain reserves and 
state-owned grain sales departments function as the main 
channel, the fluctuation has gradually calmed down, he said. 
  While this shows the strength of state macroeconomic 
control, 
the fluctuation should serve as lesson: That is, even with a 
good economic situation, we can never afford to lower our guard 
on the issue of prices and the governments at all levels must 
not wash their hands of the business, he said. 
  Asked whether reform of the fiscal and tax systems, which 
might affect the interests of some localities and enterprises, 
will be carried out smoothly, Li Peng pointed out: In carrying 
out the fiscal and tax system reform, we mainly follow the 
principles of unifying tax laws and fairness of tax burden and 
change the fiscal contractual responsibility system into a 
tax-sharing system. The reform represents a restructuring of 
the interests mix and will not levy more tax or increase burdens 
on enterprises in general, so the reform will be in the 
interests of various quarters. 
  The chief purpose of the reform of the fiscal and tax 
systems 
is to build up a reasonable tax system that will be in keeping 
with international practices and the demands of the socialist 
market economy. The tax-sharing system is a fiscal management 
system widely introduced by other countries practicing the 
market economy. 
  With the introduction of the tax-sharing system, the 
government will certainly strengthen its capacity for 
macroeconomic control but most of the central government's 
increased revenues will return to localities in different ways, 
he said. 
  Taking the ability to bear of localities and enterprises 
into 
account, and to ensure that the old and new systems dovetail, a 
transition period has been arranged during which the current 
pattern of interests distribution will remain unchanged. Even 
after that, the central government will only gradually raise its 
ratio of revenues from the increased portion of taxes, he 
explained. 
  Concerning the relationship between the reform of the fiscal 
structure and the reform of the investment structure and that 
between the reform of the foreign exchange structure and the 
reform of the foreign trade structure, Li Peng said: The reform 
of the fiscal structure will promote the reform of the 
investment structure. The current practice in a society under 
the market economy shows that investment is regulated by the 
financial market, that the number of projects is determined by 
the amount of money available, and that the investment plan is 
determined by the industrial policies. 
  On unification of the rates for yuan and the establishment 
of 
a single, controlled, and floating foreign exchange based on 
market supply and demand, the premier said this will be 
conducive to China's opening up and the development of its 
foreign trade and economic cooperation with foreign countries. 
  This will also produce a positive impact on the process of 
gradually converging China's economy with the world economy, he 
said.

<F P=106> ["Li Peng Says the Third-Generation Leading Collective Is </F>
Maturing": Report on interview with PRC Premier Li Peng by 
XINHUA reporter Zhou Shuchuan (0719 2885 2504) at Li's 
Zhongnanhai office; date note given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 January (XINHUA) -- When greeting the 
coming of the new year, State Council Premier Li Peng said in an 
interview by XINHUA that China's modernization drive not only 
has theoretical grounds, but also has organizational guarantees. 
We are more confident than any time before of China's future. 
  Li Peng said when analyzing the reasons for the world's new 
understanding of China in 1993: The fundamental reason was that 
China's reform, opening, and economic construction made great 
development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  He said: Just a number of years ago, when seeing the drastic 
changes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, some people in the world alleged that "China would also 
collapse." Facts showed that China did not collapse; instead, it 
developed and grew stronger. At present, many economists and 
commentators in the world and even some politicians have made 
more optimistic predictions and forecasts on China's economic 
strength and developmental vista than we did. Although such 
predictions and forecasts may not be in keeping with the facts, 
in any case they reflect from another angle the world's 
acknowledgement of China's achievements. 
  Li Peng pointed out: At present, Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics not only has 
taken shape completely, but also has shown its strong 
effectiveness in practice. At the same time, the third 
generation leading collective, with Jiang Zemin as the core, has 
taken shape and has been maturing gradually. Thus, our 
modernization drive not only has theoretical grounds, but also 
has organizational guarantees. Today we are more confident of 
China's future than at any previous time. 
  He pointed out, however, that in the world, some people who 
harbor malicious intentions are still spreading the allegation 
about the "China threat" in an attempt to sow discord between 
China and its neighboring countries and to undermining China's 
favorable surrounding environment. It was a U-turn from the 
allegation about China's "collapse" to the allegation about the 
China "threat," and such arguments were indeed perplexing. The 
two extreme ideas reflected some people's ignorance about 
China's real situation. A developed and strong China will never 
pose a threat to any other country, but will only make greater 
contributions to world peace and development. 
  As for how to approach some different opinions between the 
central and local authorities, or between different localities, 
and how to approach unevenness in economic development, Li Peng 
said: China is a unified country, and the socialist market 
economy we are striving to build is also a unified market. 
  He said: Of course, it is hard to avoid different opinions 
on various issues between the central and local authorities, and 
there certainly is unevenness in economic development between 
different localities. The gap between China's east and west is 
widening, but the western region itself has developed, and the 
living standards of the people there also have been continuously 
raised. In the world, uneven development is also a common 
phenomenon, and there is no exception in various countries. In 
addition, the party and government have fully noticed the gap 
between the east and the west of the country, and are taking 
measures to solve this problem. 
  Li Peng said: If some people are worried, out of their good 
will, about the development unevenness in various parts of China 
and the contradictions caused by some reform measures or by some 
local interests, then their concern is understandable. However, 
if some people, out of their ill intentions, hope and even 
assert that the development unevenness between the east and the 
west of the country will lead to China's division, and if they 
want to see trouble occur in China, then their hope certainly 
will fall through.

  [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng, interviewed by XINHUA over the weekend, expressed 
confidence for China's future, saying that the country's 
modernization is ensured with "organizational guarantee as well 
as a theoretical basis." 
  Explaining the reason why the world began to have a new 
understanding of China in 1993, Premier Li said the fundamental 
reason lies in the fact that guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has 
scored great progress in reform, opening up and economic 
development. 
  Only a few years ago, amidst the drastic changes in eastern 
Europe and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, some 
people abroad spread the idea that China would collapse. 
  "Facts have shown that China, instead of collapsing, has 
developed and grown in strength," Li noted. 
  "Some economists, critics and statesmen in the world have 
made more optimistic estimation and prediction than we do with 
regard to China's economic strength and prospect of 
development," Li said. "though not tallying with the realities, 
this reflects the world's acknowledgement of China's 
achievements from one perspective." 
  A full set of Deng's theories on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics has not only taken shape, but also 
displayed great power in practice, Li said. "The third 
generation of Chinese leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the core, 
has not only been established, but has been maturing as well." 
  "Thus, our modernization drive is blessed with 
organizational 
guarantee as well as a theoretical basis," Li said. "Today, we 
are more confident than ever about the future of China." 
  However, he pointed out that some people are spreading a 
theory that a powerful China would constitute a threat, with the 
purpose of sowing dissension between China and its neighbors, 
and thus to spoil China's good surrounding environment. 
  "From the theory of collapse to the theory of threat, this 
is 
indeed a 180-degree turn and is really hard to understand," Li 
said. "These two ideas, which both go to extremes, show total 
ignorance of China's realities." 
  A developing and more powerful China will not threaten any 
country, Li said. "Instead, it will only make greater 
contribution to world peace and development." 
  As for how to view possible differences between the central 
government and localities and the imbalanced development between 
different parts of the country, Li said: "The socialist market 
economy we are going to build up is a unified market." 
  Though the gap between China's eastern and western parts has 
expanded, the western part has been developing and the people's 
life there has been improved, Li said, adding that imbalance of 
development is a universal phenomenon in the world. 
  "The party and government are fully aware of this problem 
and 
taking measures to solve it. 
  "It is understandable if some people, out of goodwill, worry 
that contradictions might arise from the imbalanced development 
between different regions and some reform measures that affect 
some local interests," Li said. 
  "If some hostile people expected or even predicted that the 
gap between China's eastern and western parts would lead to a 
split in the country, hoping to see problems occur inside China, 
they are doomed to be disappointed," he said.

  He said: Sustained, rapid, and healthy development is our

infrastructure construction. On the other hand, we should carry 
out some long-term construction projects. In real estate 
development, we should principally build medium- and low-end 
housing to solve urban residents' housing problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign </F>
minister, by an unidentified station correspondent; place and 
date not given; from "The World Today" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Video shows Qian Qichen in a dark Western 
business suit seated opposite a male correspondent] 
  [Correspondent] Vice Premier Qian, thank you for accepting 
our interview. A review of the international situation over the 
past year reveals an Asia-Pacific fever. Some call 1993 the 
"Year of the Asia-Pacific Region." Its hallmark is the Seattle 
meeting in November. What are the political and economic 
factors behind this Asia-Pacific fever? Please discuss them 
with our viewers. 
  [Qian] The emergence of Asia-Pacific fever is not 
accidental. Economic factors have become the most prominent 
issue following the end of the Cold War. Economic factors are 
playing an increasing role in the relations of various 
countries. The Asia-Pacific region currently enjoys excellent 
economic development while the rest of the world is in a general 
economic recession. The Asia-Pacific region can now be 
described as the most economically vibrant part of the world. 
Politically, the region now enjoys relative stability and 
relatively good interstate relations, possessing a dwindling 
number of hot spots at a time when some countries are 
politically unstable, engulfed by an endless stream of regional 
conflicts. Therefore, politically speaking the emergence of 
Asia-Pacific fever is only natural, as is the way developments 
in the Asia-Pacific region have become the focus of widespread 
attention. [announcer-read passage on the Asia-Pacific region's 
growing importance in international diplomacy omitted] 
  [Correspondent] The Chinese and U.S. leaders held an 
official meeting in Seattle. The event was the focus of 
international attention. Would you please tell us what impact 
the official meeting between the Chinese and U.S. leaders will 
have on future Sino-U.S. relations? 
  [Qian] Presidents Jiang Zemin and Clinton held an official 
meeting in Seattle for the first time in five years. In my 
opinion, the meeting between the Chinese and U.S. leaders 
carried vital significance. To be sure, the meeting of the top 
leaders was not an occasion for specific discussions; it was an 
occasion for exchanging views on major issues. The development 
of Sino-U.S. relations was discussed from a long-term 
perspective and within a broader context. China and the United 
States have many common interests. At the same time, 
differences exist. Both sides are aware it is necessary to 
carry out exchanges and cooperation in accordance with the 
principle of common interests. At the same time, both sides 
also know it is necessary to carry out frank [tan cheng] 
dialogue to deal with these differences. This formula will lead 
us to the correct path for solving and developing Sino-U.S. 
relations and for eliminating obstacles. [announcer-read 
passage on Western political crises in 1993 omitted] 
  [Correspondent] In sharp contrast to the Asia-Pacific fever, 
this year Western countries have generally experienced political 
crises which have led to changes in regimes and role reversals 
for governing and opposition parties. People have demonstrated 
a mentality of change. Would you please discuss the main 
reasons for the political crises in the West? 
  [Qian] Public opinion in the West terms the current 
phenomena as post-Cold War syndrome. A very important reason 
for the occurrence of this phenomena is people in various 
countries have begun to turn their attention inward following 
the end of the Cold War because they have grown more concerned 
about domestic affairs. Domestic economic, social, and political 
contradictions; scandals; and other issues have become matters 
of great concern to people in those countries. This has led to 
changes in the original political structure. Economically, the 
entire Western world has been mired in an economic recession 
since the beginning of the nineties; the economies of some 
countries have become stagnant, whereas the economies of others 
have grown at a very slow pace or posted zero and negative 
growth. Unemployment rates in the West are high. This has 
caused social unrest and spawned a post-Cold War syndrome. 
[announcer-read passage on Russia's political and economic 
problems omitted] 
  The problem with Russia seems to be that the difficulties 
it encountered following the change in political power and in 
economic restructuring are far greater than previously 
anticipated. Russia is our largest neighbor. Because it is our 
neighbor, we of course hope the situation there will stabilize 
as soon as possible and its economy will develop gradually. 
[announcer-read passage on the world's political and economic 
situation following the end of the Cold War omitted] 
  [Correspondent] The international situation has undergone 
major changes following the end of the Cold War. What kind of 
impact do you think the new international situation will have on 
China's future development? 
  [Qian] The situation arising in the wake of the Cold War has 
posed new challenges to all countries. However, the successful 
maintenance of world peace is the most important thing. During 
these past two years -- 1992 and 1993 -- our country's economy 
began the course of rapid and healthy development. This 
precisely demonstrates the importance of the maintenance of 
world peace; this situation is very conducive to China's 
development. 
  [Correspondent] What diplomatic achievements do you think 
China has achieved this year? 
  [Qian] Diplomacy is the extension of domestic affairs. 
Because our country's domestic situation is very good, the 
situation on our diplomatic front is likewise very good. More 
than 30 foreign heads of states and government leaders, as well 
as over 50 vice presidents, vice premiers, and foreign 
ministers, have visited China this year. Our diplomatic 
activities are relatively active; a total of 158 countries have 
established diplomatic relations with us. The emphasis of our 
diplomacy is to strengthen relations with our neighbors and 
establish good-neighborly relations with them; to strengthen 
unity and cooperation with developing countries; and at the same 
time to establish economic and trade relations with countries 
throughout the world. Two major events of great importance took 
place last November. One was German Chancellor Kohl's visit to 
China, and the other was the meeting between Presidents Jiang 
and Clinton. These two events signified that Western powers 
have begun to show interest in developing constructive 
relationships with China. In other words, both Western public 
opinion and Western business communities have a sanguine view of 
China's economic development; everyone wants to do business with 
China. Under these circumstances, politicians in the West feel 
it is necessary to establish constructive relationships with 
China. I believe that in the new year, we may have diplomatic 
breakthroughs in this respect. 
  [Correspondent] What will be the emphasis of our diplomatic 
activities in 1994? 
  [Qian] The emphasis of our diplomatic activities next year 
remain the creation of a favorable and peaceful international 
environment. This can be divided into two parts. On the one 
hand, we will strengthen good-neighborly relations with our 
neighbors. On the other, we will develop broad economic and 
trade relations with all countries. What is especially 
important is what I have just said. After the Seattle meeting, 
we hope Sino-U.S. relations as well as relations between China 
and Europe will develop further. We hope a breakthrough will be 
made in this respect. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign </F>
minister, by unidentified station reporter; place and date not 
given; from the "Global Information" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, how are you? 
  [Qian] How are you? 
  [Reporter] On behalf of our listeners, I would like to first 
express our thanks to you for agreeing to this interview in 
spite of your busy schedule. 
  [Qian] I am also very glad to be interviewed by the Central 
People's Broadcasting Network. I would like to take this 
opportunity to send my regards to listeners across the country. 
  [Reporter] Thank you. Vice Premier Qian, 1993 is coming to 
an end. We would like to ask you to briefly review the 
international situation over the past year in your capacity as 
foreign minister. 
  [Qian] The past year has been unusual. The international 
community has witnessed many significant events. There have 
been both inspiring developments and worrisome issues. The 
civil war in Cambodia, which had dragged on for more than 10 
years, was eventually brought to an end. Palestine and Israel 
accorded each other recognition, fueling hope for a solution to 
the Middle East issue. After eight years of difficult 
negotiations, the Uruguay Round of trade talks eventually 
produced an agreement. These are all inspiring. However, the 
world is still far from peaceful. Regional disturbances and 
bloody conflicts have continued unstoppably. The global 
economic recession has cast a shadow over many countries. The 
number of unemployed people in the United States has surpassed 
10 million. The unemployment rate in the EC has breached the 
double-digit mark, forcing 18 million people out of work, the 
highest total since the end of World War II. 
  Nevertheless, the economies in the Asia-Pacific region -- 
especially those in East Asia -- have maintained robust growth 
throughout the year. According to data provided by the Asia 
Development Bank, the gross domestic product of the major Asian 
countries increased by an average of 7.1 percent in 1993, 
turning the region into the most economically vibrant part of 
the world with the world's highest growth rate. Such growth has 
breathed new life into the world's economic development. China 
is an important member of the Asia-Pacific region. Over the 
past two years, our country has increased its gross national 
product by some 13 percent annually. Its foreign trade volume 
in 1993 is expected to top $190 billion. The scene is one of 
national prosperity, peace, good administration, harmony, 
success, and promise. International public opinion, as well as 
that of the business community in various countries, is upbeat 
about China's prospects for economic development. 
  In the past year, our country has achieved great success in 
foreign affairs under the leadership of the Jiang Zemin-led CPC 
Central Committee. Our country has further improved its good- 
neighbor and friendly relations with neighboring countries, 
bringing these relations into the best-ever period since the 
founding of New China. Our country has maintained stable and 
friendly relations with developing countries. Its relations 
with European nations and the United States have either improved 
markedly or developed. The heads of state and government of 
some Western countries have visited China. The official meeting 
between the heads of state of China and the United States in 
Seattle has enhanced mutual understanding, and this has brought 
about a new beginning in Sino-U.S. relations. While 
consolidating our gains, we will not forget the support and 
assistance given to us by countries and people who have upheld 
justice. Looking ahead, we are full of confidence. China's 
development cannot be divorced from the world's, and the 
development of the world also needs China. We are ready to work 
together with all countries of the world and to make greater 
contributions to international peace and development. 
  [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, today when the world economy 
in general is in a slump, the economies in the Asia-Pacific 
region are, as you just said, developing vigorously. Last 
April, you attended the 49th annual meeting of the UN Economic 
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and last 
November you again flew to Seattle to attend the fifth 
ministerial meeting of the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation 
[APEC] forum. Could you give your views on APEC's prospects for 
development and China's role and position in the Asia-Pacific 
region? 
  [Qian] The population of the APEC member states accounts for 
two-fifths of the world's population. Their GNP's and volume of 
foreign trade represent 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively, 
of the world's total. In recent years, the economic growth 
rates of the great majority of its members far exceeded the 
world's average. In addition, the economies of these countries 
and regions are fairly complementary to each other, thus 
providing very favorable conditions and a foundation for 
economic cooperation. Furthermore, a major attribute of the 
region is its variety. The region has both developed countries 
and countries which are still developing, both sovereign 
countries and regional economies, both Oriental civilizations 
and Western cultures. Social systems and ideologies vary or 
even differ greatly from one country and region to another. 
  This variety dictates that economic cooperation in the Asia- 
Pacific region can only be based on common economic interests. 
Only by opening themselves to each other and adopting flexible 
and diversified approaches in accordance with the principles of 
mutual respect, seeking common ground while putting aside 
differences, and equality and mutual benefits can economic 
cooperation in the region produce substantial results. The 
realities in this region show that the conditions for 
establishing an economic community for the Asia- Pacific region 
are not yet ripe. 
  [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, you have had frequent foreign 
visits and busy diplomatic activities at home this year. 
Particularly during this year's UN General Assembly, you met 
with the leaders of more than 60 countries. I believe that this 
kind of broad contacts reflects China's importance on the 
international stage. We would like to ask you to discuss 
China's position and role on the international stage. 
  [Qian] China is the largest developing country in the world 
and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security 
Council. Thus, China's obligations and influence in the world 
are obvious. China upholds a foreign policy of independence and 
peace. We stand for establishing a new order governing 
international relations on the basis of the Five Principles of 
Peaceful Coexistence. In international affairs, we are opposed 
to interference in the internal affairs of other countries, to 
hegemonism, and to power politics. At the UN forum, we uphold 
justice and seek to safeguard the legitimate rights of 
developing countries. We have made our due contributions to 
safeguarding international peace and security, promoting the 
political settlement of regional flash-point issues, and easing 
tensions. 
  As China accelerates reform and opening up, its economic 
relations and trade with other countries of the world have 
continued to expand. China's market has been increasing in 
capacity. A huge market potential is becoming a reality. This 
has great appeal to Western countries for investing in China and 
conducting all kinds of business activities. As President Jiang 
said in Seattle, a stable, developed, strong, and prosperous 
China will not pose a threat to any country but will only make 
greater contributions to peace and development in Asia-Pacific 
region and in the world as a whole. This is the role that China 
should play on the international stage. 
  [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, China has made great progress 
in its foreign relations in the past year. China has 
established diplomatic relations with 158 countries. Could you 
analyze for us the characteristics of China's diplomatic 
activities in the past year? 
  [Qian] China has made great progress in its foreign 
relations 
in the past year. As you just mentioned, China has established 
diplomatic relations with 158 countries. In the short period of 
only one year, more than 30 heads of states or government 
leaders and over 50 vice premiers, presidents, and foreign 
ministers visited China. Arguably, our country's foreign 
relations have expanded. Especially important, I think, were two 
events which took place in November. One was the visit by 
German Chancellor Kohl to China, and the other was President 
Jiang's official meeting with Clinton in Seattle. These two 
events signified that Western powers are beginning to adjust 
their policies toward China. In view of China's economic 
development, the world is taking a new look at China and is 
carrying out a new appraisal of it weight and the role it is 
capable of playing. This is a very important change. 
  [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, thank you for granting us this 
interview. Before concluding this interview, we would like to 
ask you to say a few words to our listeners. 
  [Qian] Today is the last day of 1993. I would like to wish 
everyone a happy new year. I wish comrades and listeners 
success in your work and happiness in your family life, and I 
hope that everything goes according to your wishes. I also want 
to add that the "Global Information" program of the Central 
People's Radio Network has done a great job of providing 
information and improving listeners' understanding of 
international issues. I take this opportunity to congratulate 
you and express my appreciation. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PRC Vice Foreign Minister Tian </F>
Zengpei by correspondents (Deng Xiujian) and (Shi Yan); place 
and date not given; from the "Current Affairs" program] 
  [Excerpts] Negotiation and conflict, progress and setback; 
it all happened over this outgoing year. To review the year's 
development, our reporters (Deng Xiujian) and (Shi Yan) 
interviewed Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and two 
international affairs researchers. Here is (Lin Shaowen) with 
this year-end special "Global Briefing 93." 
  Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says that 1993 is the 
second post Cold War year. The world on the whole is gradually 
becoming a multipolar system. He admits that instability is on 
the rise, although a new world war is unlikely in a short time. 
Tian Zengpei says one important change in 1993 was the rise of 
the Asia-Pacific region in terms of political and economic 
importance. Tian Zengpei says the rapid and steady economic 
growth in Asia has become the focus of world attention and 
contrast with the recession elsewhere, especially in the 
industrial world. The national GNP in major Asian nations rose 
by 7.1 percent in 1993. He says the combined total economic 
strength of Asian nations around the Pacific Rim is now one 
quarter of the world total. This has forced many countries to 
adjust their foreign policies. The U.S. Government has 
gradually shifted its foreign policy focus to the Asia Pacific 
as President Clinton believes that it will play a most important 
role in the U.S. economy. Signs show Japan is returning to Asia 
economically. With half of its overseas investment in East 
Asia, Japan has surpassed U.S. as the leading investor in the 
area. European countries such as Germany have also adopted new 
policies toward Asia. In contrast, industrialized countries all 
suffer from a kind of post Cold War syndrome. Tian Zengpei says 
many western countries suffer from the longest economic 
recession since World War II. This caused social problems and 
political instability. Public demonstrations continue. Some 
ruling parties which have been in power for long period were 
crushed at the polls. Some government leaders have to be 
replaced. The vice foreign minister calls it the second most 
important characteristics of the year. [passage omitted] 
  Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says regional economic 
cooperation is most valued. The European Community has approved 
the Maastrict Treaty on closer European union. The United 
States, Canada, and Mexico endorsed the North America Free Trade 
Agreement to develop the region into the world's largest free 
trade zone. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held 
its first minister meeting and an informal leadership meeting, 
pledging to strengthen cooperation in economic and trade 
matters. And finally, in December, after tough bargaining, 117 
countries concluded the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade 
under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade.

<F P=106> ["Yearender" by staff reporter Liu Liping (0491 4539 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 27 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--There 
were both advances and setbacks in Sino-U.S. trade this year. 
This was the appraisal of Wang Tianming, counselor responsible 
for economic affairs and commerce at the Chinese Embassy in the 
United States. He believes problems during the year will soon 
become a thing of the past. He said: Sino-U.S. economic trade 
relations underwent relatively many difficulties in 1993, 
nevertheless, they saw a degree of improvement. 
  Quoting statistics released by the Chinese Customs, Wang 
Tianming said: The total volume of trade between China and the 
United States was $20.4 billion in the first 10 months of this 
year, with the former's export trade with the latter put at 
$12.9 billion, a rise of 17 percent, and its import trade with 
the latter put at $7.5 billion, a gain of 11 percent over the 
same period last year. It is expected that by the end of this 
year, China's import trade with the United States will be over 
$9 billion. The United States is China's third-largest trade 
partner. 
  According to the Tianming's briefing, China's exports to the 
United States were mainly textiles and light industrial 
products, while China's imports from the United States centered 
on machinery and technology-intensive commodities. Together they 
made up 75 percent of China's total import from America. U.S. 
investment in China increased a lot over last year; many large 
enterprises and companies made long-term investments in China. 
According to current available statistics, the cumulative number 
of projects using U.S. investment in China is 6,383, and the 
amount of money involved in their agreements totals $10.6 
billion, of which $3.3 billion has been utilized. The United 
States has thus ranked itself after Hong Kong and Taiwan in 
terms of investment in China. 
  China has made great efforts, according to Wang Tianming, in 
developing Sino-U.S. trade this year. Up to today, in the newly 
established "Statements of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation of the PRC," four internal regulation 
documents have been made public to increase the transparency of 
trade, while taxation on 2,898 commodities has been lowered. 
China has revised its trademark law and entered into a patents 
treaty. Sino-U.S. memoranda on market access, intellectual 
property rights, and products made by China were signed a year 
ago. The authorities concerned in China have offered great help 
to U.S. enterprises in obtaining protection for intellectual 
property rights. In March this year, Chinese and U.S. 
Government delegations reached a relatively satisfactory 
understanding on how to implement the memoranda on products made 
by prisoners.... 
  Wang Tianming stated: Of the problems and difficulties 
facing Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, the first is the 
annual reviewing and approval of most-favored-nation [MFN] 
treatment, which causes a sense of instability and insecurity 
among U.S. industrialists and businessmen. This way of doing 
things has a direct bearing on the trade cooperation between 
China and the United States. On the intellectual property 
rights issue, although China has made great efforts, the United 
States still declared it was altering China's listing from a 
nation under general observation last year to a key nation on 
the list. The United States still restricts export of high-tech 
products to China and has not yet lifted the sanctions imposed 
upon it. At the same time, the United States has imposed more 
and more new restrictions on the import of Chinese products. 
Textiles are the traditional major commodities China exports to 
the United States. The Sino-U.S. agreement on textiles, 
currently in force, is to expire by the end of this year. Both 
sides have held three rounds of talks on signing a new 
agreement. Because the United States persisted in demanding that 
the Chinese accept totally the penalty article in the 
anti-corruption provision, which was in violation of 
international norms, and the article which one-sidedly stressed 
U.S. rights, the talks made no progress. 
  Wang Tianming pointed out: It is not strange that there are 
problems and differences in the economic and trade activities 
between China and the United States. It is necessary for both 
sides to seek a solution through dialogue and on the basis of 
mutual benefit and cooperation rather than using sanctions as a 
means to put pressure on the other. Putting pressure on others 
will solve no problems. 
  Wang Tianming said: As for the coming year, it is of great 
significance to accelerate China's reform and to open up to the 
outside world. As far as the economic and trade fields are 
concerned, reform will be carried out in areas such as the 
foreign economic and trade structure and systems covering 
foreign investment, banking, taxation, and foreign exchange. 
The state will promulgate a dozen economic laws and regulations 
next year, including the foreign trade law, the foreign 
investment law, the company law, the securities law, the fair 
trade law, the antidumping law, and the antisubsidy law, which 
will have much to do with, the development of Sino-U.S. trade. 
With a population of 1.1 billion people or more, China has a 
huge market potential. Tianming revealed that in the next seven 
years, China would introduce, from abroad, 210 major 
technological items ranging over 23 trades and with a gross 
value of almost $30 billion. He said: As China and the United 
States are economically highly complementary, China will seek 
U.S. technology and advanced technical know-how, while the 
latter will require China's abundant manpower resources and its 
vast market. Economic and trade activities between the two 
countries are very promising. 
  Further development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade 
relations, Wang said, required great efforts by both sides. The 
solution of the MFN treatment problem, which was viewed as the 
bedrock of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, was 
advantageous to both countries. Economic and trade activities 
between China and the Unites States will develop in a healthy 
way so long as the United States gives up its annual practice of 
reviewing and approving China's MFN treatment. 
  China and the United States will hold the eighth joint 
committee meeting in Washington April of next year. This will 
be the first time the Clinton administration will hold such a 
meeting with China. China, Wang said, was actively making 
preparations for the meeting, and would then send a large 
investment seeking delegation comprising central and local 
enterprises to the United States. At the same time, China was 
also considering dispatching a procurement group to the United 
States. He stated: China hopes that the meeting will contribute 
to the further development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade 
relations.

Readjustment"] 
  [Text] Washington, December 31 (XINHUA) -- As the first 
U.S. president after the ending of the cold war, Bill Clinton 
has made noticeable readjustments in the U.S. foreign policy in 
1993, the first year of his administration. 
  Among the changes, the most important is to take the 
economic 
issue as a matter of national security and place it at the 
center of U.S. foreign activities. 
  With the cold war over, the military threat posed to the 
U.S. 
by the former Soviet Union no longer exists and the strategy of 
global confrontation with the Soviets pursued by the U.S. 
Government in the past 40 years has lost its real significance. 
  On the other hand, the U.S. is declining in its economic 
power with an enormous amount of resources put into the nuclear 
arms race, serious economic and social problems and a high 
unemployment rate in three consecutive years. 
  Since taking office in January, President Clinton has taken 
economic recovery as the first priority of his administration 
and made efforts to push forward an "economic diplomacy" with 
the aim of expanding overseas markets, increasing exports of 
U.S. goods and services, cutting deficits in U.S. foreign trade 
and creating more jobs for Americans. 
  As part of the efforts, the Clinton government made a three- 
pronged assault in the last few months to ensure success in 
three major aspects of vital interests to his country. 
  First, through extensive and arduous lobbying, it won 
congressional approval of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) to pave the way for the creation of the 
world's largest free trade bloc with Canada and Mexico. 
  Second, after bitter bargaining, the United States reached a 
compromise with the European Community in the seven-year-long 
Uruguay-Round multilateral trade talks by the final deadline of 
December 15. 
  If these two achievements still bear the trademark of the 
previous government, the move to develop relations with Asian 
countries is mainly a Clinton initiative. 
  The sustainable economic growth in Asia, especially East 
Asia, since the 1980s has made the region the most prosperous 
part of the world. The vast market in Asia and its potentials 
have no doubt a strong appeal to the rest of the world, 
including the United States. 
  Therefore, Clinton has changed a practice usually adopted by 
his predecessors soon after he entered the White House -- he 
went to East Asia for his first overseas visit. The President 
and his senior administration officials have not only repeatedly 
stressed the importance of Asia-Pacific to the United States, 
but have also frequently visited this region. 
  In congressional hearings on foreign policies, the 
administration's polices on Asia-Pacific have also taken a very 
large proportion. 
  At the fifth ministerial conference of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) held in Seattle in November 1993, 
Clinton took advantage of his position as the host and called an 
informal meeting of APEC leaders to discuss cooperation and 
development of the region. 
  Proceeding from reality, the U.S. Administration has also 
adjusted its policies on China. During the Seattle conference, 
Clinton held a formal meeting with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin, thus making a new, good start in Sino-U.S. relations. 
  All this shows that the U.S. Administration has changed its 
traditional "Eurocentric" policy and begun to attach importance 
to developing relations with Asia in its foreign policies. 
  As the sole superpower today, the United States, while 
valuing "economic diplomacy," has of course not forgotten its 
"status of leadership" over world affairs. 
  In this regard, the Clinton administration, unlike its 
predecessors, has stressed even more seriously the linkage of 
U.S. foreign relations with the so-called issues of "democracy" 
and "human rights" of other nations. It forces other nations to 
act according to the American concept of values and constantly 
threatens rejectors with economic or trade sanctions. 
  Furthermore, the Clinton administration has maintained that 
the United States and other nations adopt allied actions to 
interfere with regional conflicts and other "inhuman practices" 
under the name of the United Nations and other international 
organizations. 
  This foreign security strategy of the Clinton 
administration's has been dubbed by the U.S. media as 
"collective interventionism" or "new interventionism." 
  Whether it is "economic diplomacy" or "new interventionism," 
the fundamental purpose of Clinton's adjustment of foreign 
policies is to maintain the U.S. status as "the superpower" and 
to build a new world order in the interest of the United States. 
  However, time brings great changes to the world -- many 
Western countries no longer act upon whatever the United States 
says and the voice of opposition to foreign interference from 
vast numbers of developing nations is becoming increasingly 
louder. 
  The United States has sustained a series of setbacks in its 
military operations in Somalia; its once hardline positions on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti also aroused strong reaction 
domestically, sparking off a heated debate on future American 
foreign policies. 
  It has been noticed that the Clinton administration has 
begun 
to adopt more realistic attitudes on Somali and other regional 
conflicts. But, judging from the overall situation, it is 
noticeable that the overhaul of U.S. foreign policies has not 
yet finished as the foreign policy of the Clinton administration 
is still taking its shape.

<F P=106> ["Yearender" by Wan Chengcai: "1993, Year of Violent </F>
Political Turbulence in Russia"] 
  [Text] Moscow, December 31 (XINHUA) -- The year 1993 has 
witnessed violent turbulence on the uncertain Russian political 
arena. 
  The deteriorated "dual political power" crisis, involving 
the 
pro-radical-reform government and the rebel parliament, was 
culminated in a bloody October incident in Moscow and the Moscow 
authorities were totally taken aback by the outcome of the new 
parliamentary elections in mid-December. President Boris 
Yeltsin came to the conclusion a week ago that all the people 
have again come to see how complicated and contradictory the 
situation is in this country. 
  On the surface, the bloody incident in October seemed to be 
the result of the white-hot dispute on power distribution 
between the parliament and the president. In essence, it 
reflected the profound and irreconcilable differences existing 
in the society in general regarding economic reform, the state 
political system and the state foreign policy. 
  Although the use of armed force brought an end to the "dual 
political power," it cannot in any way resolve the piled-up 
social problems. 
  The December 12 referendum and the results of the ensuing 
parliamentary elections indicated that while Yeltsin's 
supporters, the so-called "reformers," have been somewhat 
weakened due to the surfacing of their internal bickering, the 
opposition has gained some strength, and the resentment among 
the people is growing. 
  President Yeltsin himself admitted that "people have to a 
large extent lost their forbearance." 
  The new state constitution, designed to affirm presidential 
rule, has been adopted, but the supporting rate of the voters 
for the president has declined from 42.7 percent of the 
registered voters in the presidential election in June 1991, to 
the 37.7 percent in the April national referendum and further 
down to a mere 30 percent in the vote on the new constitution. 
  Although a new parliament has emerged, it is not at all the 
one the president hoped for. In the race for seats in the State 
Duma among various political parties, the Liberal Democrats led 
by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy obtained 22.79 percent of the votes, 
while the so-called "presidential party," "Russia's Choice," 
garnered a mere 15.38 percent. Noteworthy is the fact that as 
many as one third of military servicemen reportedly supported 
the Liberal Democrats. 
  The parliamentary election results showed that the three 
opposition parties -- the Russian Communist Party, the Agrarian 
Party and the Liberal Democratic Party -- reaped a total of 
43.04 percent of the votes, while the three factions of the 
ruling "democratic reformers" won only 29.97 percent. People 
might differ over the reasons for the defeat of the reformers, 
but one can hardly deny the fact that the election results 
represented an objective reaction of the voters to the existing 
internal and external policies. 
  First, the majority of voters are not in favor of the 
radical 
economic reform, the "shock therapy." in the April referendum, 
50.2 percent of the voters backed the president and the 
government's reform policy. But in the December parliamentary 
elections, only 15.38 percent of the voters sided with "Russia's 
Choice" led by Yegor Gaydar, a typical representative of the 
radical reformers, and backed by President Yeltsin. 
  Second, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union 
over two years ago, Russia has pursued a foreign policy of 
"assimilating to Western civilized society" and "returning to 
Europe," which many Russians accuse of having resulted in "loss 
of national dignity" and "damage to national interests." 
  Calls for an independent foreign policy in relations with 
the 
West are growing in Russia and this helped the Liberal Democrats 
pick up a considerable number of additional votes in the 
parliamentary elections as they explicitly pointed to the urgent 
need to safeguard Russia's national interests. 
  Third, the psychological impact the bloody October incident 
had on the Russians and the varied attitudes of the people 
toward the incident were also accordingly reflected in the 
results of the elections. 
  On how the situation in Russia will develop in the future, 
the pro-government newspaper, "IZVESTIYA," on December 22, had 
this to say, "The post-election political reality is more 
worrying than the passage of the new constitution." The 
"ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI" added on December 24 that the election 
results "have virtually crushed the illusion about the possible 
alleviation of Russia's political tension," and "serve as the 
basis for prediction of confrontation between the new parliament 
and the executive branch of the state power." 
  In face of the post-election new situation, President 
Yeltsin 
has pledged to stabilize the situation in general, promote 
reform, carry out partial readjustment and make changes 
accordingly in organization and in personnel. Meanwhile, he has 
also expressed his readiness to cooperate with all the parties 
that have been elected into the parliament within the framework 
of the new constitution. 
  Observers here predict complicated and delicate relations 
between the president and the new parliament in the new year. 
It is widely believed that the key to stability in the country 
lies in a substantial improvement of the economy -- the 
emergence of a realistic government economic policy, the 
restoration and development of production and an early apparent 
improvement in people's life.

2618): "Complicated, Frequently Changing World"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- As 1993 has passed by, 
mankind is one more step closer to the threshold of the 21st 
century. 
  In the second year after the end of the bipolar structure, 
the countries of the world are facing even fiercer competition 
in the advance toward the 21st century. A complicated situation 
has taken shape as this competition has unfolded in the process 
in which various forces of the world are realigning and 
regrouping and are striving to grab favorable strategic 
positions for themselves. However, taking an overall view of the 
world's situation and international relations, both detente and 
turbulence still exist in the world. 
  In 1993, global detente has continued and developed to some 
extent in the following ways: 
  First, the big nations, especially the big powers, are 
formulating or enforcing the strategy of "economic priority," 
and a tendency toward international economic regionalization and 
economic blocs has come to take shape distinctly. The U.S. 
Clinton administration, after it was formed early this year, 
first mapped out "a plan to revitalize the U.S. economy," and in 
a strong belief that the possibility of a world war is 
decreasing, it shifted its defensive emphasis "from preparations 
for nuclear war to tackling regional wars." Meanwhile, the 
integrated European Common Market was officially inaugurated at 
the beginning of this year; the North American Free Trade 
Agreement was ratified at the end of this year; the informal 
leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
organization was convened; and various regional economic 
organizations among Asian, African, and Latin American countries 
were formed and consolidated. 
  Second, more importance has been attached to coordination 
and 
dialogue in international relations. The Chinese and U.S. 
presidents had their first formal talks in more than four years, 
while the Uruguay Round of the GATT multilateral negotiations, 
which had dragged on for seven years, eventually reached an 
agreement in December. All this indicates the desire for and 
capability of coordination between concerned parties. In 1993, 
a major breakthrough was achieved in solving the Middle East, 
South African, and Cambodian issues -- the three hot spots whose 
problems had remained unsolved for a long time. The people's 
yearning for peace and hatred of war have prompted many troubled 
areas of the world to seek political solutions instead of 
military confrontation. 
  Third, international arms reductions and arms control have 
made some new progress. The United States and Russia formally 
signed the second stage of START -- the START II Treaty -- and 
115 nations including the United States, China, and Russia 
signed the convention banning the use, production, and 
stockpiling of chemical weapons. The United Nations began to 
implement the agreement on transparency in armaments which was 
passed in 1991. Although problems remain regarding the 
implementation of the agreement and the convention, the moves 
are conducive to detente. Besides, the world's total spending 
on the military in 1993 decreased for the sixth successive year, 
and the decline in this spending is continuing. 
  On the other hand, the world of 1993 has been plagued with 
contradictions, wars, and conflicts. Regional disputes, 
collisions, and unrest have been on the rise and have combined 
to form interference that kept pounding at the international 
environment, thus creating an unstable world. This can be seen 
in the following manifestations: The contradiction overshadowed 
by the struggle for hegemony between the two superpowers in the 
past came to light further; frictions were frequently triggered 
by new changes in the political, economic, and military forces 
in the world after the end of the bipolar structure; economic 
recessions affecting the Western powers, except in the United 
States, Canada, and Britain, have not ended, and the 
contradictions among them have increased to some extent; some 
members of the CIS are still struggling in crises, as 
highlighted by the situation in Russia; quite a number of 
countries failed to do a good job of adjusting their national 
policies, thus leading to the downfall of governments, to social 
unrest, and to armed conflicts; and there are many hot spots of 
various degrees in the world which cause military unrest in 
several countries. Some big Western nations have resorted to 
power politics abroad, which has angered lots of developing 
nations. In the field of economic competition, the inferior 
situation in the South is becoming more obvious, and the gap 
between the South and the North is widening. 
  The principal factors causing regional turbulence and 
unrest are the shock wave stemming from the end of the bipolar 
structure, the U.S. attempt to dominate the world, and the ever- 
fiercer economic competition throughout the globe. 
  -- The end of the bipolar structure has shaken the 
traditional alliance formed by Western countries and maintained 
by their joint efforts in dealing with the Soviet Union; the 
contradictions between them have been sharpened. The United 
States and Europe have become divergent and have quarreled over 
the trade issue, aid to Russia, Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
bombing raids on Iraq, and the trade embargo against Cuba. The 
feelings of "Cold War victory" in the West have been replaced by 
unbearable endless worries. NATO's plan to recruit East 
European members has met with setbacks and boycotts. Meanwhile, 
an "earthquake belt" has emerged from the Balkans through the 
outer Caucasus to Central Asia. Turbulence and uneasiness have 
arisen in Europe, a continent which has remained stable for a 
long time. 
  -- President Clinton has emphasized: "The United States must 
lead the world, for which we have to pay much." [sentence as 
received] In an attempt to dominate the world, this year the 
United States has decided on its "three pillars" foreign policy 
(economic security, military backing, and support for democracy 
and freedom). While scaling down the size of its armed forces, 
the United States is heightening the mobility and 
casualty-inflicting power of its armed forces and is meddling in 
conflicts elsewhere in the world. Wielding the "human rights" 
club, it is attempting to place the rich and colorful world 
under the rule of Western values. This has led to 
contradictions and confrontation. 
  In economic competition, although there have been efforts to 
strengthen economic cooperation and to promote balanced 
benefits, the rise of "priority for national interests" and 
trade protectionism has triggered more and more contradictions. 
No matter how we look at it, this competition is unfair because 
"the poorer you get the more losses you suffer." It has become 
the major factor leading to the world's instability. 
  Judging from the current situation, the unrest in some parts 
of the world will not bring disaster to the entire world. The 
coexistence of detente and turbulence and of collision and 
coordination will continue in the years to come. The world will 
surge ahead in the midst of contradictions and struggles.

"Korean-U.S. Dialogue Initially Breaks a Deadlock"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- A DPRK Foreign 
Ministry spokesman announced on 30 December that the Pyongyang 
and Washington work delegations had made progress in talks 
conducted in New York on 29 December. Both sides agreed: The 
United States will stop conducting the annual "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercise with the ROK; in return, the DPRK will 
accept the nuclear inspections necessary to guarantee the 
continuity of the nuclear safety agreement. Both sides also 
agreed to hold a third round of talks between high-level 
officials on the basis of this agreement. 
  The progress is important and is catching the attention of 
the world. As everyone knows, the Korean Peninsula is a hot 
spot followed with interest by the world. Revolving around the 
nuclear issue, all parties concerned have gone through the three 
stages of confrontation, dialogue, and deadlock over the past 
year. 
  The confrontation stage was largely manifested in a 
resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] in February on the need to conduct "special inspections" 
of the DPRK's nuclear facilities, and in the latter's decision 
in March to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
and declare a "state of quasi-wartime nationwide" against the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercise held by the United States. 
Later, in May, the DPRK announced it had rejected a resolution 
by the UN Security Council, saying that the imposition of 
sanctions against it would be regarded as a "declaration of war." 
  The most conspicuous point of the dialogue stage was the 
start of talks between the U.S. and the DPRK. In June and July, 
Pyongyang and Washington held two rounds of talks between 
high-level officials aimed at resolving the nuclear issue, and 
some progress was made. The two sides issued a joint statement. 
DPRK renounced its decision to temporarily withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily. 
  The deadlock stage was exemplified by the fruitless 
consultation between the DPRK and the IAEA in early September, 
and in the interruption of contact between its work delegation 
and the ROK's aimed at dispatching special envoys to each 
other's countries. 
  The DPRK has always maintained that the nuclear issue in the 
Korean peninsula must be resolved through bilateral talks with 
the U.S. and that sanctions and other pressure would only serve 
to make the situation more complicated and tense. Though the 
United States sometimes talked tough, declaring that it would 
impose an "oil embargo," "economic sanctions," and so forth 
against the DPRK, it never gave up efforts to find a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue and maintained official contacts 
with the DPRK. The 18th contact between the DPRK and U.S. work 
delegations finally achieved progress on the eve of the New 
Year. The DPRK said the progress finally enabled the talks to 
"enter a normal orbit once again and was a matter for rejoicing"

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Bizhong (0719 1801 1813): "Kim Yong-nam </F>
Says Signing of Peace Agreement Is Demand of Times"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, 25 Dec (XINHUA)--On 24 December, Kim 
Yong-nam, vice premier and foreign minister of the DPRK State 
Administration Council, arranged a banquet here in honor of Mr 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the United Nations, 
and his entourage. 
  In his speech, Kim Yong-nam mentioned the relationship 
between Korea and the United Nations, and said: The United 
Nations should adopt concrete measures to replace the truce 
agreement with a peace agreement; this has become the demand of 
the times that brooks no delay. Only such practice can be 
commensurate with the new situation in which Korea has become a 
member of the United Nations, and only thus can contributions be 
made to guaranteeing peace and security in the Northeast Asian 
region. He once again stressed the DPRK position on reunifying 
the country in the form of the federal system. 
  Kim Yong-nam reiterated that peacefully resolving the 
nuclear 
problem on the Korean Peninsula by means of dialogue and 
consultations is Korea's constant position. He said: However, 
if the United States disregards Korea's sincerity and continues 
to pursue a hostile policy toward Korea and follow the course of 
exerting pressure, then Korea will have no alternative but to 
adopt resolute measures for safeguarding its state sovereignty. 
  In his speech, Butrus-Ghali said: "I sincerely hope that the 
DPRK and the ROK will have a one-seat representative in the 
United Nations." He said: Realizing permanent peace on the 
Korean peninsula in place of the truce agreement signed in 1953 
is an important matter of concern to the international 
community. If such peace is realized on the Korean peninsula, 
the United Nations will disband the "UN Force Headquarters" on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Butrus-Ghali finally said that he believed the DPRK 
Government and people will make positive contributions to 
international cooperation through the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhou Nan Issues His New Year's Message, Looking </F>
Forward to Hong Kong's Incomparably Bright Future"] 
  [Text] In the New Year message he delivered yesterday, 
Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, 
pointed out: With the strong backing of the motherland and the 
powerful support of the 1.2 billion people including compatriots 
in Hong Kong under any circumstances, we have the firm 
confidence and full ability to overcome any obstacles that might 
occur in the course of progress and ensure Hong Kong's long-term 
stability and prosperity. This goal of ours must, and can, be 
attained. The full text of Zhou Nan's New Year message is as 
follows: 
  As it will soon be the fifth Spring Festival of the 1990's, 
let me extend my season's best wishes to all compatriots and 
foreign friends in Hong Kong. 
  In the past year, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, more 
profound changes have taken place in China, eye-catching 
achievements have been scored in its reform and opening up to 
the outside world and economic construction, its stable and 
harmonious political situation has been further consolidated, 
and its international prestige has been enhanced. In the new 
year, China will continue to achieve sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development with development as the goal, 
reform as the motive force, and stability as the condition, and 
forge ahead with great strides along the path of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The vigorous 
development of the motherland has enabled Hong Kong to overcome 
some manmade, negative factors cropping up in the past year, 
thus maintaining its economic vitality. The compatriots in Hong 
Kong have come to realize more and more clearly that the fate of 
Hong Kong is more and more closely linked with that of the 
motherland, whose stability and development is the indispensable 
prerequisite for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability. 
  In the past year, the Chinese side has made active and 
sincere efforts to strive to achieve an agreement with the 
British side on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong 
on the basis of the "three conformities" principle. However, 
quite regrettably, the British side insisted on its wrong 
position of "three violations," broke its promise by 
unilaterally tabling its package to the Legislative Council for 
discussion when no agreement had been reached between the two 
sides. As a result, the bilateral talks came to an end. Under 
such circumstances, we must, along with the Hong Kong residents, 
fully accelerate the preparatory work for the formation of the 
first government of the special administrative region to ensure 
the smooth transition in 1997 and Hong Kong's long- term 
stability and prosperity. This way of doing things conforms to 
the Hong Kong residents' long-term interests. 
  We earnestly hope that people in various walks of life in 
Hong Kong will make concerted efforts, offer suggestions, 
actively participate in the preparatory work in various fields 
for the formation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
[SAR], and continue to contribute their bit to the maintenance 
of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. With the strong 
backing of the motherland and the powerful support of the 1.2 
billion people including compatriots in Hong Kong under any 
circumstances, we have the firm confidence and full ability to 
overcome any obstacles that might occur in the course of 
progress, guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition, 
comprehensively implement the "one country, two systems" 
principle, and ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity. This goal of ours must and also can be attained. 
The future of the motherland is incomparably bright, and the 
future of Hong Kong also will surely be bright. 
  In conclusion, I wish all Hong Kong residents good health 
and 
success in everything. 
  According to another report, at the time when he delivered 
his New Year message to the Hong Kong media, Director Zhou Nan 
answered reporters' questions. He pointed out: Hong Kong and 
the Chinese mainland have become an integral whole economically. 
As the mainland enjoys political stability and its economy 
develops, Hong Kong will certainly have bright prospects, and 
this is precisely where the Chinese Government's confidence and 
ability are manifested. 
  Asked if the absence of British cooperation would pose a 
problem for the smooth transition, Zhou Nan said: "As I see it, 
it will not pose any big problem. Naturally, we hope there is 
cooperation. However, it takes both sides to cooperate. If one 
side does not really want it, does that mean that we cannot get 
along and we will not pursue the `one country, two systems' 
principle?" "Still we will implement the Basic Law in 
accordance with the `one country, two systems' principle." 
  Zhou Nan said: "The Chinese Government has strictly kept its 
word in the past and will do so in the future. We already have 
a good reputation in the world in this regard." 
  In touching the issue of how to guarantee Hong Kong's smooth 
transition, he pointed out: The objective of the work of the 
Preliminary Work Committee is to ensure Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. With the mainland's political situation stable and 
its economy developing at high speed and with the support and 
participation of the entire Chinese people (including Hong Kong 
residents), the Chinese Government will surely establish, as 
scheduled, the Hong Kong SAR and the region's first government 
in strict accordance with the principle of one country, two 
systems and the provisions of the Basic Law. 
  He went on to say: "Now, the whole world has noticed that 
China's political situation is stable and its economic growth 
rate has won the admiration of many foreign friends. With their 
economies becoming an integral whole, the Chinese mainland and 
Hong Kong share weal and woe with each other. If the mainland 
prospers, so will Hong Kong. This is where our confidence and 
ability are manifested." 
  Asked of the impact of pursuing a single rate of renminbi 
against other currencies, Zhou Nan said: The pursuance of the 
single rate will be helpful and not harmful to Hong Kong. 
  Zhou Nan said to the journalists on the spot: We will surely 
implement the Basic Law. We and you are identical on this 
point. Some people will leave after 1997, but all of you want to 
stay. We also hope you will stay.

  [Text] A Chinese official in Hong Kong says Governor Chris 
Patten is not qualified to comment on China's plan to dissolve 
the territory's three-tier political setup in 1997, adding it's 
China's internal affair. 
  In his annual New Year address, the director of the New 
China 
News Agency [XINHUA], Zhou Nan, is calling on Hong Kong people 
to unite with China to ensure the prosperity and stability of 
the territory. He says the end of Sino-British cooperation does 
not mean the end of one country, two systems. Linda Li reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Li] In his New Year address, Zhou Nan 
displayed confidence and hope that both China and Hong Kong can 
work together to maintain the stability and prosperity of the 
territory. He says the fates of China and Hong Kong are closely 
linked, so if China prospers, so will Hong Kong. Zhou says 
hopes for Sino-British cooperation are dashed. But he promises 
it will not pose a problem for Hong Kong. 
  [Zhou Nan, in Mandarin] We hope that there is cooperation. 
However, it takes both sides to cooperate. If one side does not 
really want it, well, that does not mean that we cannot carry on 
or we will not pursue one country, two systems. No, we 
certainly will pursue it.

  [Text] Hong Kong, December 30 (XINHUA) -- The possibility 
of reopening the Sino-British negotiations on the 1994-95 
electoral arrangements in Hong Kong can only be considered if 
the British side withdraws the political reform scheme made by 
Governor Chris Patten. 
  This was stated by Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the 
local branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, after attending the 1994 
New Year reception held by the China Areospace International 
Holdings Ltd. here today. 
  China will watch closely whether the British side wanted to 
depart from its stubborn position, Zhang added. 
  He used a Chinese saying "he who created trouble has to 
solve 
it" to make the point that it is up to the British side, which 
broke off the negotiations on Hong Kong's future, to strive for 
the restarting of the process. 
  Replying to a question about Patten's comments on the 
dissolution of Hong Kong's three-tier councils, namely the 
Legislative Council, district boards and two municipal councils 
set up under the British rule, after the change-over of power in 
1997, Zhang said "it is an internal matter of our country. It 
is only absurd that he (Patten) should have something to say on 
it."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Zhang Junsheng Criticized Chris </F>
Patten, Stressing That He Is Not Qualified To Interpret Basic 
Law"] 
  [Text] When attending Hong Kong International Space 
Science and Technology (Holding), Ltd's reception to usher in 
1994 yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, solemnly refuted Chris Patten's attack on the 
remarks of the spokesman of the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office regarding the term of office of the 
three-tier assemblies under the British Hong Kong Government. 
Zhang pointed out: Patten is absolutely not qualified to 
comment on China's affairs. 
  When asked by a reporter what he would like to say on 
Patten's attack that the statement of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office a few days ago lacks legal authority, and his 
remark that whether the three-tier assemblies will be able to 
straddle 1997 should be determined by the National People's 
Congress, Zhang Junsheng said: "What qualification does he have 
to comment on the affairs of our country? This is an affair of 
our country. It is surprising that he made such comments!" 
  Zhang Junsheng added: "The Basic Law is the law of the PRC's 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] rather than that 
of Britain. What qualification does Patten have to interpret 
our Basic Law?" 
  He said: Originally, in a bid to effect a smoother 
transition in 1997, the Chinese side accepted the plan on the 
through train proposed by the British side. However, Patten 
dished out his constitutional package of "three violations," 
disrupted the Sino- British talks on the 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements and, under the condition that no agreement had been 
reached between China and Britain, unilaterally tabled his 
constitutional package to the Legislative Council. This has led 
to the termination of talks, and the issue of through train no 
longer exists. I have said repeatedly that according to the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the British rule over Hong Kong 
will completely end on 30 June 1997, so he has no right to 
meddle in any affair after our restoration of sovereignty in 
Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. 
  When asked by a reporter under what circumstances the Sino- 
British talks can be resumed, Zhang Junsheng answered that it 
was hard to say since the British side had terminated the talks 
and unilaterally tabled Patten's constitutional package to the 
Legislative Council in violation of its commitment. Zhang 
Junsheng added: "What is to be discussed now? He has left the 
negotiation table with his briefcase, and the door has been 
closed. What else can we talk about?" 
  In Zhang's opinion, "whoever started the trouble should end 
it." Hence, whether the talks can be resumed depends only on 
whether the British side will now totally withdraw the package 
that Patten has tabled to the Legislative Council and make 
contacts again through diplomatic channels. Zhang Junsheng 
pointed out: "Things are very plain now, just as Director Zhou 
Nan said the day before yesterday, that for those who have 
engaged in the `three violations,' the sea of bitterness has no 
bounds, but there is another sentence following that which reads 
-- those who will turn back can reach the shore." 
  Zhang Junsheng stressed: We said a long time ago that the 
Chinese Government would certainly ensure the smooth transfer as 
well as the prosperity and stability in Hong Kong together with 
Hong Kong citizens. We have such determination and confidence 
to effectively perform our work for the transition and recovery 
of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: The Preliminary Work Committee for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR is entirely capable 
of doing the preparatory work for Hong Kong's smooth transition 
at the initial stage very well. Now that the Basic Law is 
placed there, we will plan the transition issues of Hong Kong in 
accordance with the Basic Law. Originally, the Chinese side 
hoped to have British cooperation, but it refused to cooperate. 
What should we do? Will we not take back Hong Kong and 
establish the SAR Government without its cooperation? 
  As to some people's accusation that the statement of the 
Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office was not in keeping with the Basic 
Law, Zhang Junsheng pointed out: "These people simply have no 
knowledge of the Basic Law, which is the basic law of the PRC's 
Hong Kong SAR. Both the future Legislative Council or regional 
organizations will all be organizations of the Hong Kong SAR, 
whose nature will be diametrically different from that of the 
current Legislative Council and regional organizations." "The 
current British Hong Kong Government is one maintaining British 
colonial rule, which, in terms of the nature of sovereignty, is 
diametrically different from the future SAR Government -- a 
local government with a high degree of autonomy and directly 
under the jurisdiction of the central government of China as a 
sovereign state," he concluded.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said here today that the position of the Chinese side 
regarding the holding of Sino-British negotiations to solve the 
Hong Kong issue has not changed. The door to negotiations is 
open, but the key lies in the attitude of the British side. 
  According to a report, a British Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said in London on 30 December that the British side had not 
received an official note on the suspension of the negotiations 
sent by the Chinese side. Some reporters have asked the Foreign 
Ministry to verify this report. 
  An answer by the spokesman said: The Chinese side made clear 
to the British side on 29 December through diplomatic channels: 
If the British side sincerely wishes to resume negotiations, 
this will be possible only if the British side recalls the 
"partial political reform program" which has already been 
submitted to the Legislative Council for deliberation. Since 
the beginning of April, when the Chinese and British sides 
reached agreement on holding negotiations, the Chinese side has, 
on many occasions, told the British side explicitly that if the 
British side submits the so-called constitutional package to the 
Legislative Council for discussion before an agreement is 
reached in the Sino-British talks, it will mean the end of 
negotiations. The British side is very much aware of this. 
Therefore, the responsibility for the current suspension of 
negotiations lies completely with the British side. The 
position of the Chinese side regarding the holding of 
negotiations to solve the issue has remained unchanged. The 
door to negotiations is open, but the key lies in the attitude 
of the British side.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China is 
"unshakeably committed" to enforce the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and to resume its sovereignty 
over Hong Kong in 1997, a XINHUA commentary stated today. 
  According to the commentary, a spokesman for the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council stated on December 
27 that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law, the administrative power of the British 
Government over Hong Kong will expire on June 30, 1997, while 
Hong Kong's British political structure will end. 
  The three-tier political structure in Hong Kong -- the 
Legislative Council, district boards and municipal councils -- 
will be disbanded on June 30, 1997, and will be restructured in 
line with the Basic Law and the decision of the National 
People's Congress, China's legislature, the commentary noted. 
  In the final analysis, the commentary said, the essence of 
the Sino-British confrontation over the Hong Kong question is 
that "China is determined to resume its sovereignty over Hong 
Kong, whereas Britain does everything in its power to extend its 
colonial rule over Hong Kong." 
  For that purpose, the British authorities attempted to 
create, under the cover of "democracy," a status quo that they 
thought the Chinese Government would have to accept after 1997, 
so that they would be able to continue their rule over Hong 
Kong, the commentary added. 
  Having made careful organizational arrangements for Hong 
Kong's Legislative Council and other institutions, Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten asserted more than once that he did not 
believe that the Chinese Government would "overthrow" these 
institutions after 1997. 
  The commentary said that the errors made by Patten and other 
British politicians lie in that they underestimate China's 
determination to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and 
uphold the Basic Law of Hong Kong. 
  That China recovers its sovereignty over Hong Kong is to 
realize a long-term wish of the Chinese nation and to put an end 
to the most ugly phenomenon of colonial rule in the modern 
history of the world, it stressed. 
  "Is there any country in the world that dares to accuse 
China 
for its just action, and dares to serve as an apologist for 
colonialism?" the commentary asked. 
  For resuming its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it went on, the 
Chinese Government has taken a rational approach, namely, 
establishing a special administrative region in Hong Kong and 
pursuing a policy of "one country, two systems" with regard to 
Hong Kong. That policy has been provided for in the Basic Law 
of Hong Kong. 
  The Basic Law is due to come into force on July 1, 1997. 
"The Chinese Government hopes to cooperate with the British 
Government in order to effect Hong Kong's smooth transition and 
successful transfer of political power in 1997," the commentary 
said. 
  "However, by no means shall we beg the British Government 
for 
such cooperation," it stressed. 
  It also warned that whatever contradicts the Basic Law will 
be overthrown. 
  The commentary called the attention of the British 
Government 
and Chris Patten to the fact that it is out of the question for 
them to impose the three-tier political structure on the Hong 
Kong special administrative regional government.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA correspondent Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 </F>
5468): "The Responsibility Is Totally on the British Side -- 
Commenting and Analyzing the Origin and Breakdown of the Sino- 
British Talks"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Sino-British talks 
on Hong Kong, which people once pinned their hopes on, have 
totally broken down. Who pushed the talks into a dead end? Who 
should be held responsible? 
  This correspondent took part in covering the talks from 
beginning to end, which lasted more than seven months. From 
what I covered and from what I learned from various sources, we 
know there is only one answer to these questions: Britain 
stubbornly insisted on its erroneous position of "three 
violations"; from beginning to end Britain had not the slightest 
sincerity towards the talks; and in the absence of a 
Sino-British agreement, Hong Kong Governor Patten unilaterally 
took action, submitting part of the "constitutional reform 
package" to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion. 
These are the root causes which resulted in the breakdown of the 
talks. 
  It is evident Patten himself established numerous obstacles 
in order to completely block the talks, yet recently he 
hypocritically called for "continuing the talks" as if the 
responsibility for their breakdown belonged to China. Such an 
outdated colonialist trick of the thief calling someone else a 
thief and putting all the blame on the victim cannot deceive the 
people in light of justified public opinion from the mainland, 
Hong Kong, and the world. 
  As everyone knows, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks 
from 22 April to 27 November 1993. The major topic of the talks 
was the final elections to be held in Hong Kong while still 
under British rule -- that is, the arrangements for the 
1994-1995 elections of the 19 district councils, the two urban 
councils (the New Territory Regional Council and the Hong Kong 
Island and Kowloon Urban Council), and the Legislative Council. 
This deals with a string of specific problems on whether or not 
the four-year three-level framework resulting from the elections 
will continue after Hong Kong returns to China in 1997. In 
other words, it deals with Hong Kong's stable transition and the 
smooth handover of Hong Kong's political power in 1997. 
  Before and during the talks, the outstanding focus of the 
dispute between the two sides had persistently revolved around 
whether the common understanding, understanding, and agreements 
[gong shi, liang tie, xie yi 0364 6224 6156 6043 0588 6231] 
reached between the two sides in the past should be abided by -- 
in other words, it is a problem of whether or not one should act 
in good faith. 
<H5>  The Origin of Differences and the Proposal for Talks </H5>
  In fact, in the decade following 1982, both sides held 
protracted, consultative talks on the recovery of Hong Kong by 
China, its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong once again, 
and the development of the political system during Hong Kong's 
transition period. Their talks produced a series of results, 
including the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong signed 
by both sides, together with relevant agreements, 
understandings, and common understandings reached between the 
two countries. 
  The signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration solved all 
the problems concerning Hong Kong's reversion and its smooth 
transition. 
  In the process of formulating the "Basic Law" of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, China incorporated a number 
of reasonable suggestions made by Britain, and the latter also 
repeatedly promised to converge with the "Basic Law." 
  In seven letters containing nearly 10,000 characters 
corresponded between Chinese and British foreign ministers 
shortly before the promulgation of the "Basic Law," they 
exchanged views on Hong Kong elections to be held in 1995, the 
number of districts in which there would be direct elections of 
the Legislative Council, and other issues concerning the 
political development of Hong Kong, and reached an understanding 
and some agreements in principle. 
  Therefore, if China and Britan could discuss the issue of 
Hong Kong's political system under comparatively cooperative 
circumstances during the decade following 1982, it should be an 
easy matter for both sides to conduct friendly consultations on 
election details when Hong Kong is approaching the elections, 
which are due to be held in 1994 and 1995. 
  However, things went contrary to one's wishes. On 7 October 
1992, without prior consultation with China, Britain suddenly 
presented a "constitutional package" through Hong Kong Governor 
Chris Patten's policy address. It sent a serious message to 
China, namely, Britain was prepared to repudiate the basis on 
which it had maintained consultations and cooperation with 
China over the previous decade and to tear up the agreements 
both sides had reached. The method by which the package was put 
forward, and its substance, violated the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the principle of converging with the "Basic Law," 
and the relevant agreements and understandings (called the three 
principles for short) reached between the Chinese and British 
Governments. 
  The presentation of the package was such that Chris Patten's 
sudden attack directly deviated from the stipulation that the 
two countries conduct "discussions," "consultations," and 
"deliberations" on matters related to the smooth handover of 
Hong Kong's political power in 1997, which are contained in 
Annex II of the "Basic Law." Please take a look at a few events 
which occurred before the policy address was delivered: 
  -- First of all, on 18 September 1992, the British FINANCIAL 
TIMES reported the news that Britain had made a major change to 
Hong Kong's existing political system. 
  -- When British Foreign Secretary Hurd met Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen in New York on 25 September 1992, he 
briefly mentioned Chris Patten's policy package. Foreign 
Minister Qian unequivocally set forth China's stand there and 
then. 
  -- Britain sent a brief note to Lu Ping, director of the 
Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, and 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu on the policy package 
less than 10 days before it was made public. Immediately after 
receipt of the notice, Director Lu Ping sent a reply letter, 
reaffirming China's stand. 
  However, ignoring China's persuasions and clinging 
obstinately to his course, Chris Patten unilaterally took 
action, thereby stirring up an open polemic between China and 
Britain which has lasted now for six months. 
  The core of the "constitutional reform package" is to 
emphasize "change." 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that Hong 
Kong's existing political system, economic system, and way of 
life will remain unchanged and its laws will remain basically 
unchanged. However, Chris Patten has made great changes in the 
political development and in the electoral arrangements which 
will directly affect the systems after 1997. Several examples 
are as follows: 
  -- Of the 441 members of district boards and two urban 
councils, 140 are appointed. Such a practice can complement 
direct elections, and help bring in people of ability with 
various specialities, and it conforms to the aspirations of the 
Hong Kong residents. However, Chris Patten has proposed that 
all the appointed seats be abolished. 
  -- Dual membership of both the Executive Council and the 
Legislative Council of Hong Kong has always been permitted, and 
some Executive Council members are concurrently Legislative 
Council members. Such a practice is conducive to the operation 
and mutual restraint of the two councils. However, Chris Patten 
has called for a complete separation of the two councils, 
attempting to change "leading role of the administration to the 
leading role of the legislature" and wantonly raising the status 
of the Legislative Council. 
  -- Articles 45 and 68 of the "Basic Law" stipulate that Hong 
Kong's political development should be carried out in accordance 
with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. However, 
Chris Patten advocates immediate, drastic changes, such as 
expanding Hong Kong's basic constituency from fewer than 100,000 
voters in 15 functional groups (organized among specialized 
people in business, economic and other sectors) in 1991 to 2.7 
million, including all non-specialized personnel, by 1995. He 
attempts to create chaos and exclude genuine, specialized 
personnel on the pretext of "democracy." 
  Chris Patten's package, therefore, is designed to completely 
negate the agreements reached between China and Britain in the 
past. Its only purpose is to prop up a pro-Britain, anti-China 
force in the Hong Kong Government, turn Hong Kong into an 
independent or semi-independent political entity, and thus 
continue British rule over Hong Kong in a disguised form after 
1997. 
  Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" has been 
strongly criticized by people from all walks of life in Hong 
Kong. Early last year, Britain was compelled, under pressure of 
criticism, to express its desire to hold talks with China. 
Considering the overall interest of Sino-British cooperation, 
as well as the fundamental interest of the two countries, the 
Chinese side agreed to hold talks between government 
representatives of the two countries, hoping the British side 
would abandon its "three violations" and return to the track of 
Sino-British cooperation. So, the two sides conducted internal 
consultations from early February to 12 March. During the 
course of consultation, the Chinese side insisted on the "three 
principles" as the basis of talks. The British side agreed 
verbally, but deliberately complicated the issue and requested 
that Hong Kong Government officials participate in the talks as 
"official representatives." In order to hold the talks at an 
early date, the Chinese side assumed a flexible attitude and 
agreed to let Hong Kong Government officials assist British 
Government representatives as advisers and experts. 
  When the two sides were about to reach an agreement on the 
talks, Chris Patten suddenly decided to publish the 
"constitutional reform bill" in the Hong Kong Government's 
Gazette for the purpose of submitting it to the Legislative 
Council for discussion. So, the British side unilaterally 
discontinued internal consultations between the two sides on 12 
March 1993. In early April last year, the two sides resumed 
internal contacts and agreed to hold talks in accordance with 
the "three principles." To avoid external interference, the two 
sides promised to keep the contents of the talks secret. 
<H5>  Set Up Obstacles and Talks Bog Down </H5>
  During the talks, Chinese Government representatives abided 
by the agreement reached between the two sides and, from 
beginning to end, did not disclose any substance of the talks to 
the press. However, before and after the talks, Chris Patten was 
always ready to air his unfavorable view of the talks by every 
possible means in an attempt to influence Hong Kong's public 
opinion, and even "jumped the gun" to obstruct the smooth 
progress of the talks. During interviews with reporters before 
every round of talks began, British representatives repeated 
that they adopted a "positive" and "constructive" attitude 
toward the talks and that they wanted to make efforts to enable 
the talks to "ascend a peak," but, on the other hand, they set 
up roadblocks from time to time to obstruct the "mountain 
climbing" of the talks. 
  When China and Britain concluded their third round of talks 
and were about to begin the fourth, the British authorities in 
Hong Kong hastily adopted "Draft Regulations on the Boundary and 
Election Commission" on 26 May last year. A few days later, the 
Legislative Council's constitution drafting group on 31 May 
passed an agenda on holding discussions on a draft plan for 
elections once every two weeks [as received]. Thus, Britain 
unilaterally took action on issues that should have been solved 
by representatives of Chinese and British Governments through 
consultation in an attempt to force China to accept Chris 
Patten's "constitutional package" and to bring the talks into 
Patten's orbit by varying its tactics. China very quickly saw 
through the scheme. 
  Despite the fact Britain made some alterations to Patten's 
package under pressure, it still has not given up its erroneous 
stand on the "three violations." 
  During the talks, Britain kept setting new, unreasonable 
demands and even attempted to meddle in affairs under China's 
jurisdiction by virtue of its sovereignty. For instance, 
according to a stipulation of the "Basic Law," the "Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" to be 
established by the National People's Congress [NPC] in 1996 
"shall be composed of mainland members and no fewer than 50 
percent of Hong Kong members and its chairman and members shall 
be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee." But Britain 
proposed during the talks that Hong Kong members of the 
Preparatory Committee must be appointed by China and Britain 
through consultation. Britain also wanted China to guarantee 
that general elections will be held for the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council in 2007, and proposed that the 1995 election 
committee established through talks should become the pattern of 
the recommendation committee and election committee for the 
chief executive of the special region after 1997. 
  The issue of the "express train" [zhi tong che 4160 6639 
6508] was an important agenda item discussed by the two sides. 
Elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council are held once 
every four years. The Legislative Council elected in 1995 will 
remain in office until after 1997. It will be called the Hong 
Kong Legislative Council for the first two years and the 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region in the last two. According to a stipulation in a 
relevant resolution adopted by the NPC, if the formation of the 
Legislative Council elected in 1995 complies with the resolution 
and with relevant regulations of the "Basic Law," if its members 
support the "Basic Law," and if they are willing to pledge 
loyalty to the government of the special region and meet the 
qualifications stipulated by the "Basic Law," they may make the 
direct transition to become members of the first Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Region in 1997 after they are 
approved by the Preparatory Committee of the Special Region. 
They are, therefore, described as being in the "express train." 
However, Britain proposed that members of the Legislative 
Council elected in 1995 become members of the first Legislative 
Council after merely swearing an oral oath. This disregards the 
basic condition for "boarding the express train" stipulated in 
the NPC resolution and attempts to strip the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of its 
power to approve Legislative Council members. 
  Continuous obstructions on the part of Britain made it 
difficult for the talks to proceed; the talks kept pacing up and 
down at the crossroads. 
<H3>  The Motive for Deliberately Complicating the Issue is All 
Too Clear </H3>
  In order to promote progress in the talks, the Chinese side 
in the early stages of the talks proposed that the election of 
district boards and the two urban councils and the 1995 
Legislative Council election be separated in discussion. 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated the proposal during his 
meeting with Foreign Secretary Hurd in New York in October 1993. 
The reason is that the district boards and two urban councils 
are not organs of a political power by nature, elections to them 
involve fewer questions, the questions are relatively easier to 
solve, and the elections to them will be held first. The 
Legislative Council elections involve such questions as the 
functional groups and electoral committees, and the questions 
are relatively more difficult to solve. For this reason, we 
might take care of elections to the district boards and two 
urban councils first, and the elections to the Legislative 
Council later. In other words, "easier things first." 
  The British side at first rejected the proposal, though 
later 
expressed consent. However, it put forward three conditions -- 
lowering voting age, adopting the "single-seat, single-vote 
voting system," and abolishing appointed seats in the district 
boards and two urban councils. Although it insisted on honoring 
the agreements reached between the two sides in the past, the 
Chinese side assumed a very flexible and open attitude toward 
Britain's proposal and agreed to lower the voting age from 21 to 
18. It also agreed to adopt the "single-seat, single-vote 
voting system" in elections to the district boards and two urban 
councils. On the question of appointed council members, 
however, the Chinese side maintains that to properly retain the 
appointed seats can complement direct elections in terms of 
ensuring sufficient number of specialized personnel among the 
council members. At the same time, the Chinese side holds that 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself should decide 
the number of the appointed seats on the district boards and two 
urban councils after 1997, according to Article 98 of the "Basic 
Law." By adopting this position, the Chinese side is in fact 
giving telling the British side it need not set up more 
appointed seats before 30 June 1997. 
  We could say that the Chinese side has made every compromise 
possible to deal with the three conditions set by the British 
side. While the two sides had almost reached an agreement in 
view over elections to the district boards and two urban 
councils, the British side insisted on simultaneous discussion 
on the voting method for the Legislative Council election. The 
Chinese side continued its restrained and patient attitude, and 
maintained that the voting method question could and should be 
discussed in later talks, together with the discussion of other 
matters concerning Legislative Council elections. The British 
side, however, completely ignoring our view, openly and 
unilaterally proposed to discontinue the talks on arranging the 
election of regional organizations. Such an act clearly showed 
that the British side did not have even the slightest bit of 
sincerity in the talks. In short, they were pretending to 
participate in the talks, but their true intention was to carry 
out Patten's package. While the two sides failed to reach 
agreement, Chris Patten recently wantonly submitted part of his 
reform bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council for discussion. 
Are his motives not all too clear? 
  The aforesaid facts show that it goes without saying that 
the 
responsibility for the failure of the talks lies entirely on the 
British side. The failure is something which people in all 
walks of life on both the mainland and in Hong Kong do not want 
to see. The failure to reach an agreement on arrangements for 
the 1994/1995 elections also means that the question of the 
through train mentioned in the talks has become non-existent 
with the end of the talks. The three-level councils, as 
component parts of the present British Hong Kong government, 
will be disbanded with the end of the British rule in Hong Kong 
on 30 June 1997. 
  People on the Chinese side fully believe that so long as the 
6 million Hong Kong residents work hard together, the prosperity 
and stability created by them in Hong Kong can surely be 
maintained and enhanced. The Chinese side will, as always, 
continue to implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration, work 
strictly according to the "Basic Law," and earnestly practice 
the principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong. We 
can anticipate that tomorrow's Hong Kong will certainly become 
even more prosperous.

<F P=106> [By Quinton Chan and Dick Chan] </F>
  [Text] The government yesterday rejected a call from 
Beijing to withdraw the partial political reform bill from the 
Legislative Council, despite China's offer to resume talks with 
Britain if this was done. Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang 
On-sang said it was impossible to hold up the bill. "I was 
extremely pleased to hear the door to resumed negotiations 
between the Chinese and the British was not closed," she said. 
"But I don't think there is any possibility of the Governor 
withdrawing the first-stage amendment bill." 
  The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said a formal message was 
sent to Britain last Wednesday saying talks would only be 
resumed if the bill submitted to the Legislative Council last 
month was withdrawn. "The door to Sino-British negotiations is 
open, but it hinges upon the attitude of the British side," said 
the statement, carried by Xinhua (the New China News Agency). 
But Mrs Chan said tabling talks was the only way to allow the 
more controversial aspects of the reforms to be tackled. "We 
are ready to meet with the Chinese at any time convenient to 
them, so we can resume talks and arrive at an agreement," she 
said. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing's new think tank on Hong Kong's political 
future will discuss this week whether or not there should be new 
elections for the three tiers of administration after 1997. 
Local members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) 
political sub- group said new polls might not be needed, and it 
was unlikely a PWC meeting in Beijing on Friday and Saturday 
would reach any conclusions. The news comes days after the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office announced the Legislative Council, 
the two municipal councils, and the district boards would be 
"disbanded" and "re- established" after 1997 because of the 
breakdown in Sino-British talks. But PWC member Xu Ximin said 
the definition of "re- established" was open to interpretation. 
"It could mean new elections or some kind of confirmation 
procedure," he said. Fellow member Professor Lau Siu-kai said 
the PWC should first discuss whether there would be any form of 
"through train" for members of the Urban Council, Regional 
Council and district boards. "If there was a through train for 
them, then it would reduce political uncertainty and gain the 
support of district leaders," he said. 
  It is understood that at least four options have already 
been 
considered for the future political structure. These include 
the appointment of a provisional assembly to take office after 
the change of sovereignty, or a postal ballot to be held before 
1997. Maverick lawyer Liu Yiu-chu has proposed the Preparatory 
Committee for the Special Administrative Region, to be set up in 
1996, elect legislators qualified to serve after 1997. "It 
would not require new elections, respects the choice of the 
people, and shows the sovereignty of the mother country," she 
said. But Professor Lau said he thought the most likely option 
was a three- to six-month recess to allow fresh elections. "Law 
and order could be maintained under the existing structure," he 
said. "This would be acceptable to Hong Kong people, and would 
avoid anyone making use of the legislative vacuum to pass harsh 
laws, or trying to expel someone from office." 
  Other, more radical, options include either the future chief 
executive of the Special Administration Region or the National 
People's Congress taking control of the legislature during the 
first few months after the handover. Professor Lau said all the 
options had disadvantages, since they offered the potential for 
a great deal of interference from Beijing during the period just 
after China resumes sovereignty.

  [Text] Beijing, December 31 (XINHUA) -- A preliminary 
working body on the question of China's resumption of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 has intensified its 
activities. 
  The body is the Preliminary Committee for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. It 
went into high gear following its second plenary session in the 
middle of December after the British Hong Kong authorities 
decided to submit an electoral bill to the Legislative Council 
there. 
  So far, all the five specialized groups under the 
preliminary 
working committee have fulfilled their work plans and will get 
down to substantial work early next month. 
  Starting January 5, 1994, the five specialized groups of the 
working committee, namely the groups on political affairs, 
economy, law, culture, and society and security, will hold their 
meetings in Beijing to discuss concrete problems, and make 
suggestions and proposals. 
  The economic group will hold its meeting first, discussing 
issues related to construction of the new airport in Hong Kong, 
and harmonious development of large capital construction in Hong 
Kong and the mainland. Financial issues such as the handing 
over and administration of land funds, and the issue of social 
insurance for retired workers will also be discussed. 
  Priority will be given to the issue of the new airport. 
  The group on political affairs will focus its discussion on 
the principles for the formation of the first Legislative 
Council and district boards in Hong Kong. 
  The law group will check the laws of Hong Kong, including 
the 
issue of the court of final appeal of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  The group on society and security will discuss the 
definition 
of the permanent residence of Hong Kong residents and the 
freedom of exit and entry. 
  The group on culture will discuss the publicizing of the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  The five specialized groups will hold six meetings next 
month. The group on political affairs will hold two meetings.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan. 3 KYODO -- The Hong Kong 
Government on Monday [3 January] published a white paper 
covering plans to set up a corporation to build and operate the 
territory's proposed new airport. 
  The bill sets out the new corporation's powers and the 
controls which the government will exercise over it. 
  Its purpose is to reconstitute the provisional airport 
authority as a permanent government-owned entity known as 
Airport Corp. 
  Hong Kong has decided to gazette the bill despite failing to 
reach agreement with China on funding arrangements for the 21 
billion dollar project. 
  A Chinese spokesman for the Joint Liaison Group, which 
handles transitional issues with Britain, told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE that experts will study the draft bill for up to two 
months before commenting on its contents. 
  "It (the white bill) is not a big problem," the spokesman 
said. "The British side had already made the bill available to 
us." 
  "Publication of this white bill is an important step forward 
in the process of preparing for the new airport at Chek Lap 
Kok," said Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu, in a 
written statement. 
  The aim of Airport Corp. is to balance commercial viability 
with necessary government controls to protect the public 
interest, Siu said. 
  "This is a delicate balance to strike between commercial 
freedom and accountability to government," he said. 
  The bill's public consultation period will run until 
February 
28. 
  The new company will be loosely modeled on Mass Transit 
Railway Corp. which operates Hong Kong's domestic railway.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Yang Hsiao-yang (2799 </F>
1420 3152): "Fujian Taxation Bureau Chief Li Lijun Points Out 
the New Tax Systems Are Favorable to Foreign Investments"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 31 Dec (TA KUNG PAO)--The implementation of 
the new tax systems on 1 January 1994 marks a crucial step in 
tax reform. What impact will the new tax systems have on 
foreign- invested enterprises and a new round of foreign 
investments in China? With this question in mind, this reporter 
has interviewed Li Lijun, head of the Fujian provincial taxation 
bureau. 
<H5>  Foreign Businessmen Will Not Suffer Losses </H5>
  Li Lijun categorically told this reporter: The new tax 
systems, which will be implemented as of 1 January, will affect 
neither the interests of foreign-funded enterprises nor the 
enthusiasm of foreign investors. On the contrary, they will 
enable foreign-funded enterprises and foreign investors to get 
better returns. 
  He said: The tax reform will place the taxes of domestic 
enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises on an equal basis and 
the same starting line. In this way, all enterprises will be 
able to compete on an equal basis in the market economy. Prior 
to this, the taxes of foreign-funded enterprises in China were 
the industrial and commercial unified tax and the income tax of 
foreign-invested enterprises and foreign enterprises; after the 
tax reform, the industrial and commercial unified taxes will be 
turned into value- added, business, and consumption taxes. They 
will pay the same taxes as domestic enterprises now. Naturally, 
the tax reform will have a certain impact on foreign 
enterprises. If the original industrial and commercial unified 
tax is lower than the new taxes, foreign enterprises will 
certainly have to pay more if they should pay according to the 
new taxes; conversely, there will be no effect on them. For 
this reason, the state taxation department has also provided 
that, while implementing the new tax systems, we can give a tax 
refund. That is to say, foreign enterprises which have to pay 
higher taxes according to the new tax systems than they formerly 
did do are allowed to have a tax refund to ensure that their new 
taxes equal the previous ones and to guarantee that they will 
not suffer losses. With regard to those foreign enterprises 
which pay higher taxes than the new ones, they should pay 
according to the new tax systems. 
  Li Lijun said: To implement the new tax systems, the Fujian 
taxation departments have conducted a lot of investigation and 
study. They have also worked among foreign enterprises to 
enable each of them to have a full understanding of the new tax 
systems and thus remove their worries. Viewed from the present 
conditions, all foreign enterprises understand the new tax 
systems and take the initiative to cooperate with us so that the 
tax reform has made smooth progress. 
<H5>  The High Science and Technology Industry Tax Will Drop </H5>
  Li also pointed out that the foreign enterprises mentioned 
above refer to those approved before 1 January 1994. Those 
approved after that date must pay according to the new tax 
systems. These foreign enterprises will be treated equally 
without discrimination like domestic enterprises. Therefore, 
when investing in a project and carrying out a feasibility 
study, foreign businessmen should take this factor into 
consideration. 
  The Fujian provincial taxation departments have compared the 
new tax burdens of foreign enterprises in Fujian with their 
original tax level. The result is: In industry, the overall 
tax level of the new tax systems is lower than that of the old 
tax systems by 27.9 percent; in high science and technology 
industry, it is also lower; in electronics, textile, garment, 
furniture, cosmetics, drink, trade, transport and 
communications, it has risen on the average. It can thus be seen 
that if foreign businessmen invest in Fujian according to the 
state industrial policy and rationally choose trades that yield 
high investment returns, they can have great prospects, such as 
investing in high-tech industry, infrastructure, and so on. 
  Li also stressed: Fujian Province still encourages foreign 
businessmen to invest in real estate and other tertiary 
industry. The land value-added tax in the new tax systems is 
also applicable to foreign businessmen. But this is aimed at 
restricting speculation in land transactions by foreign 
businessmen; it will not have any impact on genuine property 
developers. 
<H5>  Taxation Organs Will Collect Taxes According to the Law </H5>
  In Li's view, the new systems totally conform with the needs 
of socialist market economy and respect international tax 
practices. In so doing, China's market economy can enter and 
converge with the international market at an early date. 
Moreover, the new tax systems provide that, except for the 
stipulated tax deductions and exemptions, taxation departments 
must not reduce or exempt taxes without authorization. This 
makes it possible for the taxation departments to impartially 
collect taxes according to the law. Foreign enterprises can also 
feel at ease because there is no need to worry about the 
imposition of other taxes. 
  Li stressed: After the implementation of the new tax 
systems, foreign enterprises still enjoy the preferential 
treatment of tax exemptions in the first two years and tax 
reductions in the next three. Therefore, their new tax burdens 
will not increase in the wake of the tax reform. On the 
contrary, because of investing in high and new technology and 
the infrastructure, they will be able to enjoy more preferential 
policies. He said: The implementation of the new tax systems 
in 1994 will be more beneficial to foreign investments in Fujian.

  The gross agricultural output value is expected to reach 31 
billion yuan this year, an increase of 5.8 percent over last 
year, and farmers' net income will average 1,142 yuan per 
capita, up 16 percent. 
  The province harvested nine billion kg of grain on two 
million ha of farmland, up 105 kg per ha. 
  Thanks to expansion of the areas under cash crops, Fujian 
harvested 1.35 million tons of fruits, 230,000 tons of edible 
fungus and 1.8 million tons of aquatic products this year. 
  The province's 540,000 rural industrial enterprises 
generated 
a total output value surpassing 100 billion yuan and exported 19 
billion yuan-worth of goods this year -- both double last year's 
figures. 
  The governor attributed the good result to the provincial 
government's focus on rural development.

sure that next year's output of grain, aquatic products, fruit, 
meat, poultry, eggs, milk and vegetables will be similar to that

  [Text] Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, handled official work on the spot among the 
province-run and Jinan-city-run grain stores on 30 December and 
gave grain handling directives in which he stressed: Party and 
government organs at all levels should do a good job in doing 
the seven practical things for the masses and enabling people 
throughout the province to have a peaceful and happy Spring 
Festival. 
  Yesterday is the first day in which all state-owned grain 
stores began providing an unlimited supply of grains and cooking 
oil by lowering prices and hanging a prices plate. Early in the 
morning that day, Secretary of the provincial party committee 
Jiang Chunyun, and Deputy Secretary of the provincial party 
committee and Vice Governor of the province Li Chunting were 
accompanied by responsible comrades of the provincial level 
departments concerned, on a trip to the provincial grains and 
cereal oil group corporation listen to a briefing, discuss 
measures, and make work arrangements for maintaining low prices 
for grains and cooking oil. The entourage then went to the 
grain and cereal oil foodstuffs center on Shengli Street to 
inspect the sale and supply of grains and to extend cordial 
regards to staff members and workers at the center. Jiang 
Chunyun pointed out: Rapid efforts need to be made to keep down 
the prices of grains and cooking oil and ensure market 
stability. He said: Localities in the east and west of the 
province incurred an overly large scale of price hikes in grains 
and cooking oil since the last 10 days of November. Attaching 
great importance to this, the provincial party committee and the 
provincial people's government stabilized grain prices by 
adopting effective measures in line with the spirit of 
directives of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. 
Thus, grain prices in some localities have begun to recede. He 
said: Grain prices affect the whole situation and should be 
lowered as soon as possible so that the price of grains and 
other nonstaple foodstuffs are brought to a rational level by 
resolutely implementing the important policy decisions made by 
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, enhancing 
leadership, adopting measures, and by successfully conducting 
work. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: In order to enable the mass to clear 
their minds of doubt and misgiving, we should enhance propaganda 
and education to stabilize people's feelings and clearly tell 
the masses that the grain supply is ensured by sufficient 
storage of grain from this year's bumper harvests of grains and 
oil-bearing seeds. Allocation of the supply of grains and 
cooking oil, processing of grains, and promotion of sales in 
grains and cooking oil should be done well. State-owned grain 
centers should bring their major distributing role into play. 
All of them should conduct their sales with the plate of 
unified prices and at the lowered prices and provide unlimited 
supply. Efforts should be made to ensure the grain supply for 
large and medium-sized cities and disaster-plagued areas. The 
grain supply for higher and secondary educational institutions 
should be ensured along wholesale prices. Various departments 
as well as industries and trades should actively make 
contributions to stabilizing the grain prices and markets. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: A good job should be 
realistically done to provide markets with a grain supply during 
the Spring Festival. Commodity distributing departments and 
enterprises on the commercial front should extensively open more 
channels, organize the sources of goods to enter markets, 
upgrade their service quality, and saturate the festive demands 
of the people. They should render delivery services for remote 
areas; the old, weak, sick, and disabled; households enjoying 
the five guarantees; and the family members of martyrs and 
servicemen. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: An especially good job should be 
done in managing the livelihood of the masses in the 
disaster-plagued areas and the staff members and workers of 
enterprises suffering losses. Party committees and governments 
at all levels should immediately conduct examination over their 
living conditions and adopt every possible means to successfully 
deal with their practical difficulties. Meanwhile, we should 
launch a campaign of having rich households help. Wealthy areas 
and money-making enterprises should give a helping hand to 
disaster-plagued areas and fully express the superiority of 
socialist systems under the leadership of Communist party. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: A good job should be done in 
consolidating public security in a comprehensive way and 
maintaining production safety so as to ensure the absence of 
serious incidents concerning public security and production 
safety during the Spring Festival and to ensure that the masses 
feel safe. Efforts should be made to enrich the masses' festive 
cultural life and a good job should be continuously done in 
combating corruption and encouraging administrative honesty. We 
should resolutely block various malpractices, such as hosting 
banquets and presenting gifts with public funds as well as 
indulging in extravagant eating and drinking. We should 
saturate the demands set by the party in this regard with our 
qualified work achievements. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial people's government, Jiang Chunyun extended festive 
greetings to the cadres, staff members, and workers on the 
province's grain front as well as to the people throughout the 
province in handling the official work on the spot. He wished 
the people across the province a happy new year and even greater 
achievements in the new year.

  [Text] Jinan, January 2 (XINHUA) -- Shandong, China's 
major gold producing province, fulfilled its 1993 quota for the 
precious ore by the end of November, XINHUA learned today. 
  The source declined to specify the amount produced. 
  Endowed with rich gold deposits, this east China province 
has 
for the past 18 years led the country in gold production. Its 
annual growth rate in gold produced has been more than ten 
percent since 1986. 
  Most of the state-owned, large gold mines performed well 
despite a shortage of funds and cost increases which affected 
many Chinese enterprises last year, according to sources.

  [Text] Hangzhou, December 31 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province is enthusiastic about importing foreign 
intelligence to help its economic development. 
  A survey shows that the province has invited 250 foreign 
experts to work in industry and agriculture over the past three 
years. 
  Using an agro-technique imported from Japan, Zhejiang has 
harvested an additional 783.5 kg per ha on 10.88 ha of 
experimental farmland. The technique is now being promoted 
across the province. 
  With help from a German expert, the Hangzhou Steam Turbine 
Plant in this provincial capital has improved technological 
processes and modernized its products, which are now sold well 
abroad. 
  To attract more foreign know-how, the provincial government 
has worked out special preferential policies while encouraging 
localities to take good care of foreign experts.

  [Text] Guangzhou, December 29 (CNS)--With the prices of 
grain and vegetable oil in Guangdong rising rapidly, with such 
rises in some places exceeding 30 percent within a short period 
of time, the provincial government has taken five measures to 
control the sharp increase in this sector in reaction to 
people's complaints and to maintain price stability, the 
vice-governor of the province, Mr Ou Guangyuan said. 
  The five measures are, first, prices of grain and vegetable 
oil must be brought down as quickly as possible with state-owned 
stores throughout the province being obliged to sell rice at a 
fixed price before December 31. 
  Second, state-owned stores must become the main outlets 
guaranteeing the supply of grain and take the lead in 
controlling prices. 
  Third, the transportation of grain sold by the state must be 
speeded up. 
  Fourth, grain purchasing must be well handled to increase 
grain reserves. 
  Fifth, there must be strengthened supervision and management 
of the marketing of grain and vegetable oil. Before December 
31, all state-owned stores must see that there is sufficient 
supply of grain in order to bring down prices and anyone found 
raising prices to speculate will be seriously dealt with.

  It will also regularly announce projects for foreign 
investors to choose from, he added.

and other economic activities in other parts of the world, and 
will publicize Guangdong's investment environment and policies," 
he said. 
  Moreover, the bureau will work together with other 
provincial 
departments to decide on how to use foreign funds to retool 
existing companies and develop new and high technology, he said.

  [Text] Guangzhou, December 30 (XINHUA) -- With the last 
four villages in south China's Guangdong having been provided 
with electricity recently, the province has become China's first 
to achieve the electrification of all of its towns and counties. 
  Guangdong has also seen its electric power output leaping to 
first place in the whole country this year. 
  Since 1991 the provincial government has allocated about six 
million yuan a year to help provide and rebuild electric power 
facilities in remote rural areas. 
  During the past few years Guangdong has actively absorbed 
foreign investment and raised funds through different channels 
to develop its power industry. 
  The total installed capacity had reached ten million kw by 
the end of 1992, and an increase of about 3 million kw to 4 
million kw is expected this year.

  [Text] Nanning, December 31 (CNS) -- This year has seen 
the inflation rate in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region reach 
18 percent and in the capital of Nanning 20 percent. 
  According to a region official, the inflation rate was still 
within an acceptable range for the residents there and more than 
90 percent of them have shown little concern. 
  Statistics made at the end of this year showed an increase 
in 
the cost of living of 14 percent and three percent respectively 
for urban and rural residents, taking into consideration price 
rises. 
  The first half of the year saw inflation soar in Guangxi. In 
July, retail prices increased by more than 22 percent, the 
highest in recent years. In the latter half of the year prices 
gradually dropped as the result of macro-control and by 
November, retail prices, the cost of living and the prices of 
consumption goods dropped by 2.9, 1.7 and 3.1 percentage points 
respectively over October. By the end of this year, retail 
sales will have been more than RMB 30 billion, 18 percent up 
over 1992. 
  It is predicted that 1994 will also see double-digit 
economic 
growth. With large investment going into industry, construction 
and township enterprises, coal prices will increase, resulting 
in further price rises.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 2 (AFP) -- A disgruntled employee set 
off a massive blast at an explosives factory in southern Hunan 
province which killed 61 people, including himself, the Beijing 
Youth News [BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO] reported in its weekend 
edition. Many more were injured in the explosion on November 26 
that completely destroyed the factory's main workshop, causing 
damage estimated at 2.5 million yuan (300,000 dollars), the 
newspaper said. Among the dead were four officers from the 
northwest Lanzhou military region who were visiting the factory. 
The shock waves from the blast hit a further 22 employees in 
another workshop some 100 meters (yards) away, killing three. 
  A top-level investigation into the incident was launched by 
the ministries of public security and national defence, and the 
leadership of the Guangzhou military zone which includes Hunan 
province, the report said. Initial enquiries have blamed the 
explosion on a young worker, Tan Zhixin, who had been censured 
by factory officials for gambling and had a request to join the 
unit's driving pool turned down. 
  On November 26, Tan reportedly told his friends over lunch 
in 
a restaurant that he had to eat and drink well because he 
intended to blow up the workshop and kill himself in the 
process. Later that afternoon, Tan entered the workshop with a 
number of detonators which he used to set off the explosion, the 
newspaper said.

  [Text] Washington, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- As 1994 is drawing 
near, Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United States, held a 
New Year's reception for prominent figures from local Chinese 
intellectual circles at the Chinese embassy on 29 December. He 
briefed them on the remarkable achievements scored by China in 
various fields in 1993. 
  Li Daoyu said: China's economic development has attracted 
international attention. NEWSWEEK, an authoritative U.S. 
newsmagazine, calls 1993 the "Year of China." The Associated 
Press calls China the "star" of the 1993 world economy and 
exclaims: "A peaceful, stable, prosperous, and developing China 
is rising rapidly in the East." 
  Speaking on Sino-U.S. relations, Li Daoyu said: At the 
invitation of President Clinton, President Jiang Zemin met with 
him in Seattle in November, marking the first official meeting 
of the two countries' heads of state in more than four years. 
It was a major breakthrough [zhong da de tu po 6850 1129 4104 
4499 4275], as well as a new and good beginning [xin de, liang 
hao de kai duan 2450 4104, 5328 1170 4104 7030 4551] for 
improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations; it had a positive, 
major, and far-reaching impact on the overall international 
situation. He said: "We expect China and the United States will 
capitalize on the good momentum generated by the meeting of 
their heads of state and seize this historic opportunity to 
further conduct dialogue on an equal footing, and promote the 
further improvement and development of relations between the two 
countries." 
  Li Daoyu also expressed his gratitude to people in Chinese 
communities in the United States for their positive role over 
the years in helping the motherland's construction and in 
developing Sino-U.S. relations.

"Beijing Makes Concessions on Human Rights Issue; United States 
To Set Up Consulate in Tibet"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government reportedly reached an agreement 
with the Beijing authorities last October on setting up a U.S. 
consulate in Tibet. It is expected that the U.S. consulate in 
Tibet will be set up within six months. 
  It is said that this action by the U.S. Government has a 
strong political implication because there are only a very small 
number of Americans in Tibet and the U.S. Consulate in Sichuan's 
Chengdu has more than sufficient capacity to handle affairs in 
Tibet. Therefore, the U.S.-Chinese consular agreement on 16 
October 1993 not only indicated the further improvement of 
bilateral relations but may also be regarded as Beijing's 
concession to U.S. human rights diplomacy. 
  Moreover, after the two sides reached the consular 
agreement, 
Beijing took the initiative in expressing goodwill by returning 
the remains of American military personnel killed in Tibet 
during World War II.

  [Text] Havana, December 23 (XINHUA) -- The Cuban Communist 
Party Central Committee (CCPCC) held its 4th plenary session on 
December 20, under the chairmanship of its First Secretary Fidel 
Castro, the party official newspaper "GRANMA" reported today. 
  The year 1993 was evaluated by the CCPCC as the most 
difficult in the revolution. 
  The Central Committee believed that it is necessary to 
evaluate correctly the required measures related to the creation 
of basic units of cooperative production, the legalization of 
possessing foreign currency and the opening up to certain 
foreign capital investments. 
  Among the problems is the need for each institution to work 
systematically to reduce its budget and to increase efficiency 
in the use of resources. 
  The plenary session also discussed the need to reduce the 
excess money in circulation.

  [Text] Beijing, December 31 (XINHUA) -- The volume of 
Sino-Latin American trade is predicted to top 3.4 billion U.S. 
dollars this year. 
  That is 400 million U.S. dollars more than in 1992, 
resulting 
from stable bilateral relations and complementary economies. It 
shows a strong momentum for the two sides' trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) 
figures show that in the first ten months of this year, this 
trade volume reached 2.8 billion U.S. dollars. 
  "Latin America, among China's trade partners, has jumped 
from 
no. 5 to no. 4, following Asia, Europe and North America," said 
Wang Zhiquan, a MOFTEC official responsible for trade with Latin 
America. 
  Wang attributed the thriving trade mainly to the frequent 
summit contacts between China and Latin American countries. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin toured Cuba and Brazil in 
November and the presidents of Uruguay, Dominica, Guyana and 
Mexico visited China one after the other. 
  "The visits have offered a favorable environment for the 
further expansion of Sino-Latin American trade, " Wang said. 
  During the visits, agreements were reached in the fields of 
economy, trade, investment, and scientific and technological 
cooperation. Some of the Latin American countries are 
negotiating with China for accords on scrapping double tariffs. 
  "A sound legal foundation has been laid for the growth of 
Sino-American trade," Wang said. 
  China has been a traditional importer of Latin America's 
major exports, such as copper, iron ore, steel, petrochemicals, 
paper pulp, timber, wool, grain and leather. 
  China's exports to these countries have been commodities of 
choice because of their good quality and reasonable price. 
  "We have shipped more machinery and electronic products to 
Latin America. They are leading items next only to light 
industrial goods among all China's exports to that region in 
1993," he said. 
  As China is vigorously developing its economy and looming as 
a huge market, it welcomes Latin American businesses to invest 
and produce here with their technology and resources," Wang said. 
  China has established over 80 joint ventures and enterprises 
with exclusive Chinese financing in 17 Latin American countries. 
  On the possible effect of the North America Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) on Sino-Latin American trade relations, Wang 
held that the competition will be fiercer on the American market 
for labor-intensive products, as the United States will shift 
its labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, garment-making 
and shoe-making industries, to Mexico to take advantage of the 
cheap labor and resources there. 
  However, China will be given more opportunities of trade and 
economic cooperation when the economies of Mexico and other 
Latin American countries are spurred in the wake of the NAFTA 
implementation.

  [Text] Kulekhani, Central Nepal, December 30 (XINHUA) -- 
The flood-damaged no. 1 and no. 2 stations of the Kulekhani 
Hydropower Project were recommissioned here today after being 
repaired by a Chinese Company. 
  The repairing, which took less than four months, was 
undertaken by the Henan branch of the China International Water 
and Electric Corporation (CWE) with a loan of 2.13 million U.S. 
dollars provided by the Japanese Government for the restoration. 
  A grand ceremony for recommissioning of the power stations 
was held here this afternoon. 
  Expressing his thanks at the ceremony for the help extended 
by China and Japan, Nepali Congress Supremo Ganesh Man Singh 
[spelling of name, title as received] said that "it's really 
unbelievable that the project should be finished in such a short 
period with excellent quality." 
  Water Resources State Minister Laxman Prasad Ghimire said 
that "the success of the restoration is mainly due to good 
management by CWE and the Japanese side." 
  The Kulekhani Hydropower Project was forced to close down 
after the penstock pipe of the no. 1 station and water supply 
equipments of no. 2 station were damaged by heavy floods caused 
by incessant monsoon rains in July this year. 
  The Kulekhani project's two stations provide 100 megawatts 
of 
the country's total annual capacity of power supply of 280 
megawatts. So its recommissioning would help reduce the 
load-shedding practised in Kathmandu Valley.

  [Text] Dhaka, January 2 (XINHUA) -- Eighty cargo container 
railway wagons imported from China have been proved "okay" in 
experimental operations after they arrived in Bangladesh last 
month. 
  The wagons, the first of its kind ever bought from China by 
this South Asian country, were manufactured by the Beijing 
February 7th rollingstock works, according to Wang Yanping, 
marketing manager of the works. 
  The factory, a major wagons builder in China, has adopted 
international standards in manufacturing these wagons valued 
more than 2 million U.S. dollars, Wang said. 
  Local officials in charge of the matter said that the 
introduction of the wagons will largely strengthen local 
railways' cargo transporting capacity. 
  Bangladesh, suffering from traffic jams everywhere, is eager 
to improve its railway network, and many foreign companies 
including some from China are competing one another to enter the 
potential market. 
  Besides cargo wagons, Bangladesh needs to import more 
locomotives and passenger compartments.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Ren Kan: "BOC Mulls Impact as </F>
FECs Are Phased Out"] 
  [Text] A senior official from the Bank of China called 
upon local branches to prepare for the unification of the 
dual-track foreign exchange system and to "conscientiously" 
carry out the withdrawal of foreign exchange certificates (FECs). 
  The bank will replenish its reserves of foreign currencies 
to 
cope with the possibility of rising demands for foreign 
currencies in the future, said Wang Xuebing, the newly appointed 
president of the bank which issues FECs. 
  The withdrawal of FECs from the economy is a task with wide- 
ranging impact, Wang said on Wednesday. 
  The People's Bank of China has announced that the country 
will no longer issue FECs. Existing FECs can be used 
temporarily and will be gradually withdrawn by the banks. 
  The discontinuance of FECs was one of the measures China was 
expected to launch next year to extend reform of the country's 
foreign exchange control system. 
  Wang Qiren, the bank's chairman of the board, said the 
central government has placed great expectations on the Bank of 
China and expects the bank to aid the establishment of the new 
exchange system in the socialist market economy. 
  The bank specializes in foreign exchange and foreign trade 
business, and will continue to be a State-designated foreign 
exchange bank under the new system. 
  The bank's president said all banks should treat foreign 
exchange reform as a top priority next year. 
  "We should have a high sense of social responsibility to the 
task," Wang said. "These duties must be performed well." 
  The bank's head office has established a special group to 
strengthen the bank's work on the foreign exchange control 
system. 
  Some of the bank's departments have also organized special 
divisions to do preparatory work. 
  The president said the bank's head office will make efforts 
to map out detailed management regulations and send them to 
local branches in the near future. 
  To ensure the Bank of China's smooth operation under the new 
system, its head office summoned local bank officials 
responsible for accounting, settlement and foreign exchange 
savings to Beijing for a two-day training course. The classes 
began today. 
  These officials will immediately return to their branches to 
teach local staffs. 
  In another development, it was announced the China Foreign 
Exchange Trading Centre will open in Shanghai during the first 
half of 1994. 
  It will be the largest and most advanced marketplace for 
trading foreign currency in the country. 
  The outfitting of the foreign exchange trading centre is now 
in full swing. The centre's computerized trading system will be 
connected to six major cities throughout the country on January 
1. 
  According to local banking sources, the government-sponsored 
trading centre will mainly provide services to banks in the 
trading and settlement of hard currencies.

Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fujian, and Zhuhai on 30 December: 
"Unification of Renminbi Exchange Rates Well Received in Various 
Localities; Foreign Exchange Markets Quiet, Prices Stable"] 
  [Text] After the news was made public last night that 
China would unify the renminbi exchange rates as of 1 January 
1994, the renminbi exchange rates stabilized at 8.7 yen to the 
U.S. dollar yesterday. Foreign trade departments, 
product-exporting enterprises, and foreign businessmen generally 
welcome this measure, but the black market price for foreign 
exchange certificates [FEC] fell on the announcement. 
  Shanghai: After the news was announced that the renminbi 
exchange rates would be unified as of 1 January, there was a 
strong reaction in Shanghai, China's largest economic city. 
  Our reporter has learned from foreign exchange "speculators" 
that no one wants to ask about the FECs, which previously were 
as attractive as the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate between the 
FEC and the renminbi has dropped from 1:1.4 to 1:1.1. With the 
abolition of foreign exchange settlements, it will be easy to 
exchange foreign currencies into renminbi. Many black market 
traders think it will be very difficult to operate in the black 
market in the future. 
  Chinese residents have a lot of FECs. To prevent them from 
devaluating further, many people are shopping in foreign-related 
arcades, bringing about extraordinarily brisk business. Take 
the well-known Shanghai Friendship Store as an example. As it 
is still less expensive to buy gold with FECs than with 
renminbi, the turnover in gold ornaments doubled today. 
  There has been no great change in terms of transaction 
volume 
at the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center today, but more 
small traders are selling U.S. dollars. The central bank has 
absorbed more than $6.3 million. The swap center finally closed 
at 8.7 yen to the dollar, which has remained at this level for 
several months. 
  Moreover, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center -- 
China's largest -- today closed the last foreign exchange swap 
transactions for 1993 with an annual transaction volume of over 
$5 billion. 
  Guangzhou: The market reaction in Guangzhou is quiet today 
and the foreign exchange swap market is operating normally. 
  As provided by the Guangzhou Foreign Exchange Swap Center, 
from today's swap exchange price for individuals, we can see 
that since the small readjustments on 24 December, there have 
been no changes in exchange rates so far. The spot exchange 
buying price is 825 yuan per 100 U.S. dollars; the banknote 
buying price is 815 yuan; and the selling price for spot 
exchange and banknotes is 877 yuan. The rate between the Hong 
Kong dollar and the renminbi is: Buying price -- 100:107 for 
spot exchange and 100:106 for banknotes; Selling price -- 
100:114 for both spot exchange and banknotes. 
  A person in the trade holds that the unification of exchange 
rates does not have a major impact on foreign exchange swap 
business, either for individuals or for enterprises. A person 
in charge of the deposits and exchange swap section of the 
Guangzhou branch office of the Bank of China said: Since the 
launch of foreign exchange swap business, most foreign exchange 
business has been operated according to foreign exchange swap 
prices. For this reason, the effect on business following the 
exchange rate unification is very small. 
  A person in charge of the Guangdong Foreign Exchange Swap 
Center stressed: Following the unification of exchange rates, 
the terms under which enterprises use foreign exchange will be 
relaxed. To a certain extent, this will ease the situation in 
Guangzhou in which demand for foreign exchange is greater than 
the supply. 
  When commenting on the unification of exchange rates and 
other new measures for reforming the foreign exchange management 
system, Xu Dezhi, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial 
Commission for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said: 
Although these measures come under reform of the banking 
system, they are principally operated in the foreign trade 
field. In his view, these measures are very favorable to the 
expansion of foreign trade and exports. 
  Fuzhou: After the news on the unification of exchange rates 
was announced, the price of foreign currency dropped on the 
black market today. It dropped from 8.63-8.65 yuan to the U.S. 
dollar yesterday to 8.6 yen today. According to a foreign 
exchange speculator, the price will contionue to fall tomorrow. 
This is because the unification of renminbi exchange rates will 
deprive speculators of the chance to make profits from the "dual 
price system." 
  Shenzhen: Since it was rumored that the state would further 
reform the foreign exchange management system as of New Year's 
Day, the reaction in Shenzhen's banking sector is calm today. 
There has not been any abnormal situation. 
  The listed exchange rate between the renminbi and the U.S. 
dollar remians 8.7:1, as it has been in the past few days. 
Since FECs are not widely circulated in Shenzhen, there is no 
problem of a drop in the exchange rate of the FEC. As for the 
argument that the circulation of foreign currencies is banned in 
China, the public here generally hold that there is a special 
reason for Hong Kong dollars to circulate in certain places in 
Shenzhen. It is unlikely that it will not be used any longer in 
the near future and therefore there have been no major sales of 
Hong Kong dollars. 
  Zhuhai: There has been no change in the swap price for 
renminbi in Zhuhai today. It remains as it has been in the past 
few days. 
  Although Zhuhai residents learned from the newspapers and 
television that the exchange rates of the renminbi would be 
unified as of 1 January, the reaction has been calm. 
  It also has been learned that the Zhuhai Foreign Exchange 
Swap Center will not open for business on 1 and 2 January 
because of the holidays. The initial market reaction to the 
unification of the renminbi exchange rates will be known on 3 
January.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter He Sui-i (0149 4482 </F>
1837): "Foreign Businessmen Welcome Unification of Renminbi 
Exchange Rates, Believe It Will Be More Worthwhile To Invest in 
Mainland"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou 30 Dec (TA KUNG PAO) -- Foreign investors 
here universally welcomed the announcement of the unification of 
the renminbi exchange rates effective 1 January 1994. In an 
interview with this reporter, Lou Yu-huai, general manager of 
the Guangdong Provincial Service Center for Foreign Businessmen, 
said that many foreign businessmen believed they would benefit 
from now on in the payment of staffers' and workers' wages in 
the hinterland and in the verification of funds. 
  Lou Yu-huai explained that foreign businessmen had to use 
their foreign currency to obtain renminbi at the official 
exchange rate in order to pay the wages of staffers and workers 
in the hinterland, and the taxation administration constantly 
checked their foreign exchange receipts. In general, it was 
impossible for foreign-funded enterprises to avoid such legal 
channels. However, with the unification of the exchange rates, 
foreign exchange can be freely bought and sold; the dollar, 
which was 5.7 yuan at the official exchange rate, now can yield 
more than 8 yuan, and thus the cut in wage costs is 
self-explanatory. 
  Second, according to regulations, the value of foreign 
investment in fixed assets in China must be calculated in 
renminbi, so every $1 million invested yielded only 5.7 million 
yuan at the official rate before the unification of exchange 
rates, when the funds were verified according to foreign 
exchange receipts. Beginning with 1994, however, every $1 
million will yield 8 million yuan, meaning that every $1 million 
will yield an additional 300 million yuan, which will be a great 
benefit to any foreign businessman. 
  Third, foreign businessmen also will benefit from this 
practice in the calculation of costs, for they now are freed 
from doing several calculations in accounting. 
  However, this new policy might have negative effects on 
foreign businessmen. For example, viewing the present 
situation, the change in procedures can be slow in meeting the 
requirement of wide-ranging implementation of unification of 
exchange rates, and there will be some gaps in service. Foreign 
businessmen may find it difficult to feel comfortable with the 
confusion arising from the change. 
  In addition, foreign businessmen all along have been 
"flexible" in their accounts because of the two exchange rates 
in price-fixing. When declaring taxes and profits, more often 
than not, it was a case of "superficial deficit, with actual 
profit." However, with exchange rates unified, it will be 
impossible to take advantage of the price difference "loophole" 
any longer. 
  As for the reaction of the man on the street to the new 
central policy, psychological fluctuations still can be detected 
out of his seeming indifference. It was believed that the 
exchange rate on the market long had been based on the black 
market; the new policy served only to legalize the black market 
exchange rate, and there was nothing strange in that. However, 
this policy obviously has demonstrated a 70 percent devaluation 
of the renminbi. People recently have vied to exchange all the 
renminbi in their hands for hard currencies so as to reduce the 
risk of devaluation.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- The People's Bank of 
China today issued a circular concerning the circulation and use 
of foreign exchange certificates [FECs]. The full text of the 
circular is as follows: 
  Circular of the People's Bank of China on Circulation and 
Use 
of Foreign Exchange Certificates (31 December 1993) 
  1. According to the guidelines of the "public notice of the 
People's Bank of China on further reform of the foreign exchange 
management system," the FECs currently in circulation may still 
be used in buying goods or services without a time limit. 
Existing provisions on the use of FECs remain unchanged, and 
unauthorized price increases on commodities bought with FECs are 
prohibited. If any special reason makes it necessary to 
readjust the price of any of such commodities, the readjustment 
must be made with the approval of the commodity price department. 
  2. FECs and FEC accounts held by organizations in China 
authorized to accept FECs shall be converted first into U.S. 
dollars according to 31 December 1993 official exchange rate, 
and then settled according to the exchange rate of the day. 
  3. Organizations in China authorized to accept FECs may 
continue to accept FECs after 1 January 1994, converting the 
FECs first into U.S. dollars according to 31 December 1993 
official exchange rate, and then settling the exchange according 
to the exchange rate of the day. 
  4. Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and Hong Kong, Macao and 
Taiwan compatriots in China may continue to use the FECs in 
their possession. They may also convert the FECs back to 
foreign currency according to 31 December 1993 official exchange 
rate by showing their passports or identifications at the Bank 
of China. FECs may be exchanged also at the Bank of China 
branch offices outside China and in this case the owner must 
also show his or her passport or identification to bank 
personnel. 
  5. Without the approval of the State Foreign Exchange 
Management Bureau, no enterprise or organization has the power 
to change the provisions concerning the circulation, use, and 
exchange rate of FECs.

  [Text] Beijing, January 1 (XINHUA) -- China today bids 
farewell to the official exchange rate for good. 
  The People's Bank of China, the central bank, published at 
seven this morning [2300 GMT] what it calls the market rate 
which sets one dollar against 8.7 renminbi yuan. 
  This is yesterday's average price of U.S. dollar at the 
government monitored foreign exchange swap markets in major 
Chinese cities. 
  The exchange rates between Chinese yuan and the other major 
foreign currencies have also been readjusted accordingly. 
  Yesterday's official rate was 1: 5.8 between U.S. dollar and 
yuan. 
  An official with the State Administration of Exchange 
Control 
(SAEC) said that the rate is set with reference to the swap 
market rate. 
  "Before the inter-bank foreign exchange market is 
established 
and goes into operation, the swap market rate will be an 
important and reliable reference since it basically reflects the 
market demand and supply and has been accepted by the general 
public," the SAEC official said. 
  He noted that the rate also conforms to the latest changes 
of 
main hard currencies in international financial markets. 
  "It's relieving to see that the unified exchange rate of the 
first day is that close to the swap market rate," said Tao 
Liming, a financial expert contacted by XINHUA through telephone. 
  "It will boost the confidence of the public in the yuan and 
can be accepted by enterprises since most of them have long been 
running business at the swap market rate," said Tao who heads 
the International Finance Research Institute under the Bank of 
China.

  [Text] Beijing, January 1 (XINHUA) -- Starting today, 
China has replaced the two-tiered foreign exchange rate system 
with a single, controlled floating rate system based on market 
demand and supply. 
  This marks an important step in the country's advance 
towards 
a market economy. 
  Reform of the foreign exchange system, announced by the 
People's Bank of China, is to unfold in the following aspects: 
  To buy and sell foreign currencies through banks, with a 
standardized and unified inter-bank foreign exchange market 
established, while gradually phasing out the swap markets which 
are currently in operation; 
  To cancel the exchange retainment and delivery systems 
practiced by Chinese enterprises, as well as the mandatory 
allocation of foreign exchanges. 
  The state will no longer issue foreign exchange certificates 
(FEC) and ban the circulation of foreign currencies in the 
domestic market at the same time. 
  From now on, the state will regulate the foreign exchange 
market mainly through economic and legal measures, to achieve 
the balance of international current account. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth National 
Congress 
of the Chinese Communist Party decided to speed up the financial 
reform which is deemed to be one of the important parts of the 
economic reform. 
  However, the success of the financial reform hinges on the 
on- going reform of the foreign exchange system. 
  The dual-rate foreign exchange system, or the co-existence 
of 
the official rate and a swap market rate, have many drawbacks 
which have hindered the development of China's foreign trade and 
foreign investment. 
  The original dual-rate system was difficult to manage and 
supervise. Moreover, it bred corruption. 
  The reform will exert positive influence on many aspects, 
especially on China's further opening to the outside world. It 
will help attract more foreign investment, enhance efficiency in 
the use of foreign funds, and facilitate the flow of capital. 
  By the end of 1992, a total of 100 billion U.S. dollars had 
flowed into China, equivalent to over 800 billion Chinese yuan. 
  The figure was far more than the total amount of stocks and 
bonds the country issued for the same period, which stood at 
over 500 billion yuan. 
  The reform will also make foreign exchange more available to 
Chinese enterprises. With necessary documentation, they will be 
able to buy hard currencies from the banks at any time. 
  It is also beneficial to foreign investors, as they can 
register their capital and remit their profits at the same 
exchange rate. 
  The reform of the foreign exchange system is beneficial to 
the resumption of China's status as a signatory of GATT, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  China should, among others, abide by the GATT regulations on 
exchange rates, for the country's re-entry into the 
international trade system. 
  The unification of the exchange rates has paved the way for 
China's goal of making the Renminbi a freely convertible 
currency and eventually keep it in line with the international 
markets. 
  However, economists here said that there remained a lot of 
things to do to replace the old system with a new one which is 
still embryonic. 
  The authorities will resort to economic and legal measures 
to 
realize their macro-economic regulations on foreign currencies 
and international current accounts and avoid fluctuations of 
exchange rates to ensure the continuous, speedy and healthy 
development of the country's economy.

  [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign 
exchange markets were generally quiet on the first trading day 
today after the decade-old dual-track exchange rate system was 
scrapped on January first. 
  Early in the morning the specialized banks screened the 
market rates of renminbi against major foreign currencies -- 
posted by the central bank, the People's Bank of China. 
  Smooth trading was reported on China's major foreign 
exchange 
swap centers. At the Shanghai center, the country's leading 
indicator, one U.S. dollar was traded at 8.7 renminbi yuan, 
with the total trading volume for the day hitting 16 million 
dollars. 
  That was approximately parallel to the level of the last 
trading day of last year, observers here said. 
  A bank official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the 
specialized banks will mainly adopt the benchmark exchange rates 
announced by the central bank before an inter-bank foreign 
exchange market is established. 
  Observers here noted that the exchange markets keeping their 
orderly operation demonstrates a good start for the introduction 
of a floating market rate. This, to a great extent, has 
benefitted from China's progressive reform of its foreign 
exchange system over the past few years. 
  The government has been eager to limit the scope of the use 
of the official exchange rate. Up to the end of last year 
China's swap centers offered more than 85 percent of the total 
foreign exchange needed for the country's imports and exports. 
  This laid the foundation for the shift toward the new, 
market- oriented system. 
  Meanwhile, as most of the macro-regulatory measures 
introduced by the central government over the economy in July 
1993 are still in place, and especially as the authorities have 
repeatedly pledged to stabilize the exchange rate, the balance 
between demand and supply of foreign currencies achieved since 
last July will not be changed in the short term. 
  Steps to protect the vested interests of localities, 
enterprises and individuals are considered to be another factor 
in helping stabilize the market. 
  This consideration is crystallized in such measures as 
allowing enterprises to use foreign exchange accumulated under 
the old system and declaring that foreign exchange certificates 
(FEC) can be used for payments with their value unchanged until 
they are gradually withdrawn by banks. 
  However, most experts here agree that it will be some time 
before enterprises, the general public and the banks get used to 
the unified exchange rate system. 
  Over the next few weeks or months most of them will probably 
take a wait-and-see attitude, and will inevitably adjust their 
behavior to the new environment, gradually, the experts assume.

  [Text] Beijing, December 29 (XINHUA) -- The Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has undergone rapid growth in 
the past ten years of reform and opening up. 
  The total assets of the bank have swollen to 1,430 billion 
yuan (about 250 billion U.S. dollars) and its capital funds 
total 48 billion yuan (about 8.5 billion dollars), the ICBC 
announced. 
  This indicates an average annual increase of 47 percent of 
the volume of assets over the past decade. The bank said its 
yearly profit averaged 13.6 billion yuan (about 2.4 billion 
dollars). 
  Set up on January 1, 1984, ICBC was intended to take over 
the 
credit services of the People's Bank of China after the latter 
was ordered to function as China's central bank. 
  After ten years of development, ICBC has become the largest 
state-owned specialized bank in terms of assets, branches, 
services and advanced equipment. It ranked 13th among the 
world's 500 biggest banks listed by the British magazine 
"Banker." 
  ICBC also opened new channels to raise money, such as 
issuing 
financial bonds. The present remaining sum of the various loans 
totaled 1,070 billion yuan. 
  Meanwhile, ICBC brought in credit cards and joined the 
international Master Card and Visa Card organizations in 
succession. It has issued two million Mudan (Peony) Cards and is 
going to issue personal gold cards next year. 
  Officials from ICBC said that they were pondering next 
year's 
plan of reform and development, including laying down managerial 
regulations on the ratio of liabilities to assets and risk of 
assets, in line with the spirit of the Basle Accord."

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Dec (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- According 
to an official of the Office for Tax, Financial, and Price 
Inspections under the Ministry of Finance, from late August to 
the end of November, the 1993 nationwide tax, financial, and 
price inspection uncovered a total amount of 12.717 billion yuan 
involved in the violation of financial discipline in various 
aspects. Of this amount, 8.2 billion yuan should be delivered 
to the state treasury, and 6.372 billion yuan had been retrieved 
by the state treasury. These figures were respectively 55.59 
percent, 49.74 percent, and 32.5 percent higher than those for 
the same period last year. 
  In the nationwide inspection, 71,711 institutions and 14,881 
people were fined as the result of enforcing financial 
discipline. Among this number, administrative and party 
disciplinary actions were taken against 31 people. The judicial 
organs placed on file for investigation and prosecution the 
cases of 198 people who had seriously violated the law and 
discipline.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "China To Slow Down GDP </F>
Growth"] 
  [Text] China plans to slow down its gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth this year in a bid to end the country's recent 
history of boom-and-bust economics. 
  China's GDP growth is expected to reach between 9 and 10 
percent in 1994, three percentage points lower than last year, 
an official with the State Information Centre said. 
  The Chinese Government believes a "moderate development in 
the GDP" this year is a positive step towards calibrating the 
nation's economic growth, said Wang Changsheng, deputy director 
of the Centre's Economic Information Department. 
  Meanwhile, as it moves to unify its exchange rates, the 
country's exports are expected to be stimulated this year. On 
the other hand, import growth may fall from 1993 due to higher 
costs. 
  Wang, whose centre is under the State Planning Commission, 
told Business Weekly in an interview that China's exports might 
reach $108 billion in 1994, representing an increase of some 14 
percent from last year. 
  But its imports would only chalk up a yearly growth of 13 
percent to reach nearly $116 billion this year. 
  This is because of many restraints like the higher exchange 
rate and massive imports in 1993, have weakened State foreign 
exchange reserves, he said. 
  "China should act with caution in 1994, as it needs a stable 
financial market to pave the way for its bold reforms involving 
taxes, exchange rates, accounting systems, and State property," 
he noted. 
  In order to enact further market reforms to spur sound 
economic growth China has decided to allow its fixed assets 
investment to grow by only 10 percent in 1994. If it does, it 
will reach some 1.4 trillion yuan ($241.4 billion), allowing for 
inflation. 
  The government believes it can manage its money supply and 
market prices best if it slaps controls over fixed assets 
investment, which became a factor fuelling both real estate 
speculation and inflation in 1993. 
  Wang reiterates that a proper price environment is crucial 
for the ambitious deregulatory packages being introduced by the 
government. 
  But the government will ensure strong financial backing for 
infrastructure projects, which aim to ease the country s 
bottlenecks in the transportation, telecommunications and energy 
sectors. 
  He predicted that retail sales in China will hit 1.63 
tri11ion yuan ($281 billion) this year, a 21-per-cent increase. 
  And the inflation rate will also keep pace with retail sales 
by hitting at least 10 per cent nationwide--and 15 percent in 
the country's 35 largest cities. 
  But he warned that to hold the inflation rate within 10 
percent will be a difficult task, as the country's economic 
sectors, especially agriculture, still have many problems due to 
the slow growth in farmers's income and high production costs. 
  The annual population increase of some 15 million people at 
present, plus burgeoning food industries, have made it more and 
more difficult for the grain producers to keep the country's per 
capita grain ration from decreasing. 
  Unlike the service industry, which might chalk up a high 
growth rate, both the agricultural and industrial sectors are 
expected to see their development remain at around the same 
level as last year. 
  The deputy director said agricultural output this year is 
expected to chalk up a growth rate of 3.5 percent, the same as 
last year. 
  Industrial output might reach 15 percent this year, down six 
percentage points from last year. 
  But the service industry, which includes transportation, 
finance, insurance, telecommunications, real estate, 
information, technology and education, will see its output 
growth hit 11 percent this year, up 1.5 percentage points from 
1993.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Year of Reform"] </F>
  [Text] The year 1993 was marked by China's intensified 
reform efforts to build a socialist market system and 
accelerated economic growth that has eclipsed that of most other 
countries in the world. 
  A nation with 1.1 billion people is also enjoying political 
stability, national unity, and social progress. 
  The Chinese Government has demonstrated maturity and greater 
insight during the past year by resorting to economic means, 
instead of mere administrative decrees, to regulate the once 
overheated economy; it is fostering the rule of law and 
introducing a civil service system to improve efficiency; and it 
has waged a timely campaign against corruption to keep the 
administration clean and honest. 
  The decision endorsed by the Party's Third Plenary Session 
of 
the 14th Central Committee last November blueprinted the 
framework for the socialist market economy and spelled out the 
immediate tasks and goals for the country's reform and opening 
up during the 1990's. 
  In fact, China has steadfastly embarked on a road that 
starts 
from a centralized planned economy and leads to a socialist 
market system throughout the last 15 years of reforms. The 
decision further provides principled guidance for the most 
crucial stage of such a transition. 
  The nation has a reason to be proud of its achievements last 
year: Its gross domestic product rose a hefty 13 percent over 
the previous year. The output of cereals, edible oil, and meat 
all surpassed records. The income of urban dwellers, accounting 
for the double-digit inflation, was 10 percent higher than the 
previous year, while the living standards of the rural 
population continued to improve. 
  Internationally, China's prestige rose remarkably thanks to 
its firm adherence to an independent foreign policy that 
emphasizes world peace and progress and, in particular, to 
President Jiang Zemin's successful overseas tour. This in turn, 
has contributed to building up a favourable international 
environment for China's domestic development. 
  The year 1994 will be crucial for the country's development 
of a market economy because the heaviest reform package is to be 
put forward, including a substantial restructuring of the 
banking, financial, taxation, and state industrial sectors. 
They are indispensable in the framework of a market economy. 
  The task is challenging indeed because the deepening reform 
will readjust the functions and interests of different 
departments and the national and local governments. 
  This requires, on the one hand, the various sectors and 
localities to place the interests of the whole nation above 
departmental and regional gains while, on the other hand, the 
policy-makers to be extremely considerate of the demands of 
ordinary people. 
<H5>  Macrocontrol </H5>
  It is essential for the central government to continue and 
improve its macroeconomic regulation. This is a delicate job 
because an overdose will suffocate the economy while a looser 
package will fuel inflation. 
  Agriculture deserves special support because it remains the 
basis for China's economic development and because income of the 
800 million people in the countryside has yet to catch up with 
that of the nation as a whole. 
  The State-owned industries need to undergo thorough 
restructuring to adopt modern enterprise mechanisms and to 
maintain their leading role in the economy. 
  It is only natural that various problems may crop up during 
the reform process, considering the scope of the change and the 
size of the country. Yet it has become the nation's consensus 
that only further reforms can lead the country forward. 
  It is hoped the new year will see more extensive development 
of the socialist market economy, social stability, democracy, 
and cultural life. 
  After all, China's progress and prosperity will mean greater 
contributions to world peace and development, and to the whole 
civilization of the human race.

  As the New Year approaches, various localities, departments,

wider openness to the outside world. In the meantime, economic

noted that since the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important remarks made during his south China tour in the spring 
of 1992, along with the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu 
kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic growth 
and the increase in comprehensive national strength, China has 
exerted an impact on the international community which is not to 
be ignored: In the various factors by which economic growth in 
the Asia-Pacific region is maintaining vigorous momentum, China 
is exercising the role of a "booster," and in the various 
endeavors to push forward the global economic development, China 
is a positive and active factor. A developing and flourishing 
China is making its greater contributions to the world peace and 
development. On this occasion of bidding farewell to the old 
year and ushering in the new, the colleagues of this newspaper's 
Economic Department held a forum especially on the subject of 
the relationship between China's economic development and the 
world economy. We now publish the following excerpts from it: 
<H3>  More and More Serious Attention Has Been Paid to the "China 
Factor" </H3>
  Lu Zhenhua (7120 2182 5478): The vigorous momentum of 
economic development in China increasingly has attracted 
worldwide attention. Recently, the following four figures were 
most widely discussed by people: China's rapid economic growth 
has lasted for 24 months, China's economy has shown a growth 
rate of 12 percent, the economy in the Asia-Pacific region grew 
by 8 percent, and the world economy grew by an average of 2 
percent. During these "24 months," China's places in world GNP 
and import-export trade volume have moved forward several times. 
Some people said that China's 12 percent growth rate has given 
impetus to the 8 percent growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region, 
and also has generated the world's 2 percent growth rate. At 
present, when many countries are considering ways to promote 
economic development, accelerate economic recovery, and lower 
unemployment rates, they all place the "China factor" at a high 
level -- something that has never been seen before. This is 
obviously practical. China is a developing country with its 
economy just taking off, so it is wrong to exaggerate the role 
of the "China factor." However, China possesses a vast market, 
as well as a great potential for opening up this market along 
with economic development. It is indeed an unwise move to 
overlook or abandon this market. According to statistics, over 
the past five years, foreign capital directly utilized by China 
amounted to approximately $30 billion. Meanwhile, it spent $400 
billion in purchasing foreign goods. It is anticipated that 
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, there will be an increase of 
more than 10 percent in these two areas. Such a large amount of 
capital and huge commodity market will bring many opportunities 
to various foreign countries and regions. 
  Dai Lan (2071 1526): According to the latest World Bank 
statistics, foreign funds flowing into China in 1993 exceeded 
$27 billion, and China has become the world's largest country 
into which foreign capital has flowed. In the 15 open cities, 
more than 240 representative offices have been set up by over 
130 financial institutions from 29 countries and regions. The 
quick access to China by foreign banks and their extensive 
involvement have attracted people's attention. Since last year, 
China's stocks have crossed the Pacific Ocean and begun trading 
in the renowned stock market in Wall Street. Wall Street 
financiers likened the Chinese stocks to "mountaineering 
tigers." Over the next five to 10 years, China, being a major 
region for the future development of "energy" in the world, will 
see substantial growth in the securities markets. 
  Japan's Nomura Securities is the first foreign organization 
to set up a representative office in China. Nomura took an 
optimistic attitude toward the relatively high growth rate that 
China will be maintaining and the funds that China will raise on 
the largest scale ever seen in history for the development of 
its agriculture, energy, transportation, and telecommunications 
in a period of time to come. Through Nomura's introduction, more 
than 300 Japanese enterprises have come to China one after 
another to set up foreign-invested enterprises there. In 
addition, it has specially set up the Nomura (China) Investment 
Company, Limited, to engage in various investment projects of 
considerable size in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and other 
cities. Thus it is obvious that China's vigorously developing 
economy really has provided good opportunities for foreign funds. 
<H3>  Overseas Manufacturers Are Optimistic About the Markets in 
China </H3>
  Xu Zhengzhong (6079 2973 0022): China's consumer market is 
an enormous one, and is significantly characterized by the 
growth of its market capacity outpacing its economic growth. 
This year, China's total volume of social commodity retail 
sales will increase by 23.5 percent. Also, judging from the 
consumption structure, both daily consumer goods and durables 
have universally begun to change to a diversified pattern at 
multiple levels. The strong demands of China's consumer market 
not only accelerated the readjustment of the world's industrial 
structure of consumer goods, but also brought about the 
prosperity of these trades. This is demonstrated by the fact 
that at present, many countries are contending with each other 
in studying China's consumption structure in order to be suited 
to the consumer market in China. 
  In addition, the brisk consumer market in China also 
provides 
outlets for the substantial amount of idle funds from all over 
the world. At present, owing to the sluggish markets in quite a 
few countries and regions, the return rate there has been 
seriously affected, but the stable and prosperous consumer 
market in China has provided investors with exactly the 
environment and confidence for their success. 
  Lu Zhenhua: The striking characteristic of China's market is 
its hugeness, with great potentials and multiple levels. 
Domestic manufacturers have placed high hopes on it, and it has 
an appeal for overseas manufacturers. Analysis of the prospects 
of China's market just according to the increase of 22.5 percent 
of the total social commodity retail sales across the country in 
the first 11 months of this year over the corresponding period 
last year is not comprehensive enough. We should note that at 
present, there exist privately owned foreign exchange amounting 
to nearly $10 billion and personal savings exceeding 1,600 
billion yuan, which are potential forces for consumption. If we 
analyze China's market potential from a deeper level, people 
will come to some kind of understanding that is more 
encouraging. First, the total population of the Western 
developed countries is about one-half China's current 
population, which, though under control, is still growing at a 
rate of 1 percent. The demands of such a huge population at 
multiple levels certainly will give impetus to world commodity 
production. Second, the markets of the Western countries have 
tended to mature, while the development of China's market has 
just begun, and is full of opportunities. Third, the economic 
development achievements attained by China over the past dozen 
years have been shared by the great majority of the people, and 
with their income growing, they are rapidly turning into actual 
market demand. Today, many overseas manufacturers' opinion that 
the "China market should not be lost" stems precisely from their 
considerations of immediate and long-term interests. 
<H5>  China's Economy Is Being Linked to the World Economy </H5>
  Liu Luyan (0491 7627 3601): China's foreign economic 
relations and trade made a stride forward in 1993 on the basis 
of sustained development. It is anticipated that the total 
value of exports will be over $91 billion and imports will be 
approximately $100 billion. Regarding direct foreign 
investment, a grand total of some 130,000 foreign-invested 
enterprises have been approved; industrial output value 
accounted for six percent, and import and export volume 
accounted for over 20 percent of China's total. [as received] 
This indicates that the dependence of China's economy on 
foreign countries has increased repeatedly, and its relationship 
with the world economy has become closer and closer. 
  In this era when science and technology are advancing by 
leaps and bounds, it is an irreversible tendency to merge the 
domestic economy with the world economy. Since reform and 
opening up, China has made unremitting efforts to link its 
economy to that of the world. The foreign trade structural 
reform has been deepened deliberately, with its intensity being 
further increased this year, the management of export quotas and 
licenses has been relaxed, the imposition of import regulatory 
taxes and requirement for all lists of imported substitute goods 
have been canceled, and import tariffs have been reduced twice. 
All this has enabled China to move closer to GATT requirements. 
As a participant in the Uruguay round of talks, China has made 
major adjustments in its foreign trade policies according to the 
requirements of the talks, and has drawn up a list of tax 
reductions or remissions for agricultural and nonagricultural 
products, the service trade, and so on. In short, China is 
moving positively toward standardized international trade. 
  Qin Jingwu (4440 0079 0582): In China's primary energy (yi 
ci neng yuan 0001 2945 5174 3293), the development of petroleum 
particularly requires international cooperation. In 1992, when 
China designated the East China Sea and Tarim Basin for foreign 
companies' prospecting and development at their own risk, scores 
of foreign companies submitted tenders. In the meantime, China 
discovered a number of oil and natural gas deposits in the 
Tarim, Dzungaria, Turfan, and Hami Basins. Moreover, China's 
oil industry has emerged from the national boundaries and has 
engaged in overseas oil prospecting at its own risk. It has 
signed agreements on oil prospecting with Canada, Peru, 
Thailand, and Papua New Guinea, which indicates that China has 
set up a global concept of oil exploration in order to seek 
cooperation for energy development in the sphere of the world. 
  Xu Zhengzhong: During the decade before reform and opening 
up, China mainly exported some labor-intensive preliminary 
materials and rough products, and the ratio between them and the 
technique- intensive products for exports was 7:3. Alongside 
the technological advance and industrial structural 
readjustment, the proportion of finished products in the 
country's export commodities grew so rapidly that the former 
ratio has been reversed to become 4:6. More and more China's 
hi-tech products have crossed national boundaries to take part 
in international competition. This certainly will exert an 
impact on the industrial structural readjustment of 
international trade.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China has decided 
on new, lower provisional tariff rates on 234 categories of 
imports and nine types of exports in 1994, a customs official 
said here today. 
  The Tariff Policy Commission of the State Council has 
decided 
that provisional tariffs are to be levied on imports of major 
raw materials for agricultural and industrial production, 
including farm chemicals and pesticides. 
  Imports of products which China either does not produce or 
in 
which the country faces shortages, such as spare parts for major 
machinery and electric products, is also on the list of 
provisional tariff rates. 
  China will also collect tariffs at provisional rates on nine 
categories of exports, including lead, zinc, tin, phosphorus and 
benzine. 
  The customs official said that the move is part of the bid 
to 
reduce the effects on the prices of imports which may be brought 
about by the currency reform to going into force on January 1, 
1994. 
  The provisional tariffs are lower than the present 
preferential tariffs spelled out in the country's tariff rules 
for imports and exports, and some tariff rates on export 
commodities will be reduced to zero under the provisional rates. 
  China cut tariffs on 2,898 categories of imports last month.

  [Text] Changchun, January 1 (XINHUA) -- Since 1988, tens of 
thousands of surplus rural labourers in China have been pouring 
into the country's prosperous coastal areas and big cities, 
bringing about great changes to the country's rural and urban 
economy. 
  Experts call the phenomenon a "tide of rural laborers 
migration" or a "great historical migration." 
  At first, most of the migrants came from relatively backward 
or over-populated areas, such as Sichuan, Zhejiang, Henan, Anhui 
and Jiangxi Provinces. 
  However, the impact has now spread to northeast China. More 
and more farmers in the area, who used to be reluctant to leave 
their fertile black farmland, have left their land to work in 
cities, other provinces or even abroad. 
  Xinsheng, a Korean autonomous village in Changbai Mountains 
in Jilin Province, has a population of 970 in 232 households. 
Now, 83 households with 353 people have gone to work and live 
in the cities. 
  Statistics show that 8,921 households or 17.4 percent of 
rural households in Huinan County of Jilin Province have left 
the county. Among the population having left, 12,949 are 
labourers, accounting for 12.2 percent of the county's total 
rural labourers. Three hundred and eleven of the labourers have 
gone to work abroad and 2,819 are working outside Jilin 
Province, while 3,273 are working in other counties. 
  Experts estimate that at least one tenth of the rural 
labourers in Jilin Province have migrated. This means that over 
730,000 labourers in the province have migrated so far. 
  According to sources from the Public Security Bureau of 
Changchun city, capital of Jilin Province, more than 90,000 
farmers registered for transient residence in the city in 
October this year alone. 
  Most of the migrated farmers resettle around the urban area 
or near the trading markets of farm produce. In some markets, 
60 percent of booths are taken by migrant farmers. 
  At first, most of the migrants from the countryside worked 
as 
nurses, construction workers or peddlers. However, they can now 
be found in nearly all trades, such as building, transport, 
telecommunications, commerce, services and manufacturing. 
  Some migrant farmers even invested capital in setting up 
shops or high-tech enterprises in urban areas. Eight farmers 
from Shulan County of Jilin Province established a water supply 
equipment company in Changchun city with 90,000 yuan (15,000 
U.S. dollars). 
  With help from higher education colleges and research 
institutes, products of the company have squeezed into the 
market of 29 cities in five provinces. Now, the company has 
fixed assets of 1.1 million yuan (nearly 200,000 U.S. dollars). 
Its annual output value has hit seven million yuan (1.2 million 
U.S. dollars). 
  Last year, the company was listed as a high-tech enterprise 
by the Changchun city government. 
  Most local governments adopt policies to encourage the 
migration of farmers, saying it benefits all sides. 
  First, many migrant farmers engage in hard jobs in building, 
transport and service trades, which urban workers are unwilling 
to do, providing the urban residents with great conveniences. 
  Second, some migrant farmers set up restaurants or other 
businesses, providing urban residents with more job 
opportunities. 
  Third, migrant farmers have helped promote the economic 
development of both the urban and the rural areas. 
  Yangzishao town of Huinan County in Jilin Province has 
accepted 1,120 rural people in the past three years, who set up 
various kinds of enterprises in the service industries. As a 
result, the town became prosperous. Last year, the town's 
revenue from the service trade alone reached 6.6 million yuan, 
which accounted for 22 percent of the town's total output value. 
  Yang Li, a farmer in Changcongshao village in Huinan County, 
left home to work in a pipe factory in Xian city, capital of 
Shaanxi Province, in 1985. 
  He returned home in 1988, bringing back information, new 
ideas and technology. He established a pipe factory with an 
annual output value of 200,000 yuan in his home village. His 
fellow villagers followed his example and have set up 24 other 
enterprises, whose products sell well in a dozen provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions. 
  "A farmer leaving as a student will return as a skilled 
teacher," the local people say. 
  On the other hand, migrant farmers have brought great 
pressure on the cities. They have become rivals of urban 
residents for employment, escalating unemployment crisis. They 
have also added more burdens to the already strained water 
supply, power supply, transport and post and telecommunications 
in big cities. 
  Nevertheless, most experts are optimistic about the present 
migrant tide. They said that from a long-term point of view, 
the pressure can be turned into motive for the development of 
cities. 
  Experts suggest that several measures should be taken now to 
bring the migrant tide under control. 
  These measures include adjusting the resident registration 
policy and allowing farmers to settle down in the urban areas, 
setting up a unified labor market to provide migrant farmers 
with more job opportunities, and speeding up the construction of 
small towns to absorb more surplus rural labor.

(5012 0393)] 
  [Text] Where is Deng Xiaoping? 
  He did not make an appearance for the recent grass-roots 
people's congress elections in Beijing. Deng did not appear in 
the television footage of some big shots casting votes. 
However, the official news reports said Deng cast his vote. 
  This was rather mysterious and confusing. So it was rumored 
that Deng had fallen ill, and he did not come to the polling 
booth. His vote was cast by other people on his behalf. It was 
also said that Deng had not contracted any special disease, but 
was simply getting senile, so his health remained normal. It 
was even said that Deng left Beijing in the last month of 1993, 
and the rumor came from some senior officials. 
  In December 1991, Deng Xiaoping began his inspection tour to 
the south, and uttered a series of remarks that shocked all 
quarters. 
  In December 1993, Deng travelled to the south again, and was 
said to have spoken many times. The main subject of his talk 
remained economic reform and he still called for promoting 
production through reforms. In addition, Deng also emphatically 
opposed localism and their local assertions for "independence." 
  There were some detailed reports about Deng's travel to the 
south: 
  On the evening of 9 December, accompanied by Yang Dezhong of 
the CPC Central Committee's General Office, Wu Xiuquan, and Li 
Desheng, Deng Xiaoping set off on a special train from Beijing's 
South Railway Station. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Ding Guangen, 
and Wen Jiabao saw him off at the railway station. It was said 
that strict security measures were taken for the special train, 
which had eight carriages. One was for Deng Xiaoping, one was 
used as a conference room, one was a dining place, one for the 
security personnel, one for the entourage, and two for Yang 
Dezhong, Wu Xiuquan, and Li Desheng. Another carriage was a 
spare one. Before Deng Xiaoping boarded the train, Liu Huaqing, 
Wen Jiabao, Tao Siju, and Yang Dezhong personally inspected the 
special train, stopping on a special railway line. One year 
ago, at a meeting of the Central Security Guard Bureau, Liu 
Huaqing said: "We must guarantee Comrade Xiaoping's health and 
safety with a responsible attitude toward the party and the 
people, and this is your noble duty." 
  On the early morning of 10 December, Deng Xiaoping arrived 
at 
Baimashan Station in Jinan, Shandong, and the train moved to a 
special line. Deng met with Shandong Province's party and 
government leaders and the Jinan Military Region's leaders on 
the train. He mainly talked about several issues. 
  Deng Xiaoping said: "Reform should be deepened. This is a 
battle of assaulting heavily fortifications, and is also a 
revolution. Certain costs will have to be paid for a 
revolution. I agree that action should be taken as long as a 
correct judgment is made, and we cannot just wait and see. The 
conditions will not fall from the heaven, and the God will not 
endow us with such favorable conditions." 
  "There is a valuable conclusion in these years. That is, 
there is no debate inside the party, and our work should not be 
bothered by theoretical controversy. Thus, we can concentrate 
our time and energy on fulfilling the central task and properly 
handle new questions in reform and opening. Some people inside 
the party were not happy to see that no debate was launched. 
They are keen to launch debates and polemics. The attitude of 
the central leadership is firm. That is, no debate is to be 
started. I think that it is difficult for those who want to 
start a debate to actually do so." 
  Deng Xiaoping added: "Now, we should overcome localism and 
individualism, and should punish those involved in serious 
cases. The central leadership has repeatedly stressed the need 
to reinforce the party spirit and the sense of organization and 
discipline in the course of reform. People must keep the 
overall interests of the nation in mind and should take the 
interests of the whole into account." 
  "I should commend Shanghai, Guangdong, and also Shandong, 
Sichuan, Beijing, and Liaoning. They have all done a good job." 
  "Party cadres should have a self-sacrificial spirit, and 
should give more consideration to the benefit of ordinary people 
and actually seek more real benefit for them. This is an 
important point. Whether the reform principles and policies 
will achieve the expected results will first be tested by 
practice and will also depend on where the work performances and 
behavior of our party and government leading cadres are decent 
and proper." 
  In his talk, Deng stressed the point of fighting against 
localism. From the above-quoted remarks, one may see that the 
main current obstacles to reform and opening first come from the 
intention of some people to start a debate and secondly from 
localism. Some local party and government leaders ignored or 
even defied the central instructions and orders. Deng warned 
that those involved in serious cases should be "punished" [yao 
fan yi fan 6008 0646 0001 0646], and this remark was rather 
important. 
  However, Deng also had to appease the local authorities, 
and required that the Armed Forces give support to local 
construction. He told the responsible people of the Jinan 
Military Region: "The Army should fulfill its own central task. 
In the period of peaceful construction, some troops are rather 
lazy, weak, and loose. Serious attention must be paid to this 
problem. The troops are often affected by the environment and 
the local conditions. So the political and ideological work 
must not be relaxed. When there are conditions, the Armed 
Forces should support and help local construction. In recent 
years, relations between local party organizations and 
governments on the one side and the military units on the other 
were rather harmonious, and this is the mainstream. It is still 
necessary to improve relations between the troops and the 
civilian people. The local party organizations and governments 
are also responsible for this, and must not neglect the work in 
this regard." 
  From Jinan to Nanjing, Deng Xiaoping once again sternly 
criticized localism, and blamed some local party and government 
cadres for disregarding the superior authorities and the central 
leadership. 
  On the late evening of 10 December, Deng's special train 
arrived in Nanjing. On the morning of 11 December, Deng 
Xiaoping met with party and government leaders of Jiangsu 
Province and principal party and government leaders of Suzhou, 
Wuxi, Xuzhou, Lianyungang, Changzhou, Nantong, and Zhenjiang 
Cities. After listening to the work reports by the provincial 
and city leaders, Deng said: "Jiangsu Province has good 
conditions, and should make greater contributions to the state, 
to other provinces and regions, and to the general public. 
Greater efforts should be made to advance reform. Now, a 
favorable factor we have is that the local authorities and the 
central authorities are striving for the same objective, and the 
party, the government, and the people are striving for the same 
objective. However, when achievements have been made, you 
should guard against complacency, and should not unwittingly 
pursue localism and individualism. This is not good. The 
subordinate should obey the superior, individuals should obey 
the organization, and the whole party should obey the central 
leadership. Now, in some party and government departments, some 
cadres disregard the superior authorities and disregard the 
central leadership. How can they be allowed to behave in this 
way? If this problem is not rectified, they will commit major 
mistakes." 
  Reportedly, after Deng Xiaoping and his entourage stopped 
over in Nanjing, they went to Nanfang Fountains of the Tai Hu in 
Wuxi the same afternoon, where there is a holiday resort of the 
Central Military Commission. Deng Xiaoping stayed in Villa No 
2. There are a total of 12 villas in the holiday resort, and 
there are also two four-story buildings for holiday-makers. 
They were built in the spring of 1992. There are doctors and 
medical experts from the military medical schools in this 
sanatorium, which serves military cadres at and above the army 
level or retired cadres at and above the ministerial level. 
Some central leaders call it the August 1 Sanatorium. 
  This reporter visited an informed old cadre, and asked him 
to 
talk about his feelings about Deng's remarks in his recent 
travel to the south. 
  -- Deng basically told the truth. 
  -- Deng still insisted on the idea of "pursuing quick 
development" and "no simply waiting." This showed that he felt 
that his days were numbered, and this was the mentality of an 
old man. 
  -- Deng mentioned that "some people are unhappy to see that 
no debate is launched and they are still keen to start a 
debate." This referred to the conservatives. These people have 
become an obstacle to reform. In a briefing circular, the 
General Office of the State Council recently made public Zhu 
Rongji's speech at a meeting, and he more clearly mentioned such 
obstacles. Zhu Rongji said: At present, the whole party is 
advancing reform, opening, and economic construction under the 
guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory about building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. This has become an irreversible trend. 
However, we should note and should be courageous enough to 
admit that there remains certain resistance. The resistance 
mainly comes from inside the party, including the outdated and 
backward idea of sticking to the rigid dogmas that are no longer 
suited to the development of our society. Practice has proved 
that this is an erroneous and even harmful idea. The thinking 
and behavior of some leading comrades also constitute an 
obstructive force at some times and in some events. This has 
had a substantial harmful impact on the situation. Obviously, 
Zhu's remarks were directed at the conservatives. 
  -- Of course, differences not only exist between reformists 
and conservatives but also between reformists and "radical 
reformists." For example, on the issue of the central 
authorities' macrocontrol, Zhu Rongji admitted that there were 
"different ideas." He said: The central leadership holds that 
macrocontrol is not only an instant need but also a long-term 
task. However, another opinion holds that the central 
authorities' macrocontrol can only be a temporary measure or an 
urgent means, which is short-term and temporary, in the 
transition to the market economic structure. People holding the 
latter opinion fear that permanent macrocontrol may lead to 
retrogression, that is, the guideline of "taking the planned 
economy as the mainstay" may be effected in the name of 
macrocontrol, and the market economy will thus be confined to a 
limited scope and cannot extend and grow freely. 
  -- On the one hand, Deng admitted the existence of localism 
to a serious degree. On the other hand, he said that the local 
authorities and the central authorities shared the same 
objective. This was obviously self-contradictory. In fact, 
there are sharp interest conflicts between the localities and 
the central government. Deng's talk in fact admitted the 
existence of localism to a serious degree, so it was necessary 
to overcome it or even "punish" some people. Reportedly, local 
officials aired resentment at a recent national economic 
conference, and complained about a series of wrong actions taken 
by the central authorities. The contradictions between the 
central authorities and the localities not only find expression 
in policies and measures, but also in the distribution of tax 
revenue. Differences also exist over the current anticorruption 
work. Zhu Rongji himself said: The central leadership holds 
that the anticorruption work is a long-term task. The current 
condition of corruption is rather serious. Corruption has 
seriously harmed economic construction, reform, and opening, and 
may even directly ruin the people's political power and ruin our 
party and our cause. Corruption has laid bare the problems and 
errors in the work of the central authorities. The other 
opinion holds that corruption is unavoidable in the course of 
economic development, reform, and opening. Such problems emerge 
in an endless stream in the high level of the political and 
business circles of such capitalist countries as Japan and the 
ROK. The "different opinion" mentioned by Zhu mainly came from 
local officials. In addition, a third opinion holds that the 
problem exists in the incorrect line taken by the central 
leadership, which gave up the inner-party ideological struggle, 
denied the objective existence of class struggle, and ignored 
the corrosive influence of Western ideology. This resulted in 
corruption. This is the opinion of the conservatives. 
  -- Deng said: "The party, the government, and the people are 
striving for the same objective." This was not completely in 
keeping with facts. In fact, the party only pursues a limited 
degree of reform in the economic field and does not pursue any 
political reform at all. The people are opposed to the policy 
of not carrying out political reform. To a certain degree, they 
welcome economic reform, but they are not completely satisfied 
with it. Zhu Rongji also frankly mentioned this without mincing 
words. When talking about the reform orientation of the 
state-owned enterprises, he said: The central leadership holds 
that the key lies in how to give play to the initiative of the 
large and medium- sized enterprises. The state-owned 
enterprises must carry out reforms, and must adapt their 
management and operation mechanisms to the requirements of the 
market economy. In the next 10 years or so, the state-owned 
enterprises will still play a main role. The different opinion 
holds that reform must proceed from the large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, competition should be openly supported, 
enterprises which do not achieve good business results, do not 
sell their products well, run in the red, and fail to repay 
debts should be merged, auctioned openly, or transferred to the 
hands of overseas investors or private entrepreneurs, and the 
joint- stock system be adopted among state-owned enterprises. 
One more opinion holds that now is the time to totally adopt 
the joint-stock system among all state-owned enterprises and 
even effect privatization. They say that the joint-stock system 
and privatization represent the orientation of enterprise 
reforms. These are different opinions on deepening reform and on 
the orientation of the reform. People holding the first opinion 
are mainly scholars and experts. People holding the second 
opinion include scholars, experts, intellectuals, and many 
ordinary people, who also hold similar ideas. If there is a 
referendum, it is believed that the option of "privatization" 
will win. 
  -- It is not certainly correct to stop all debates. The 
conservatives may be defeated in a polemic. Why isn't this a 
good thing? On the other hand, through debates, the voice of 
the people will produce positive effects on reform, and the 
truth will become clearer in the course of debates. 
  It was said that Deng Xiaoping stayed some time in Wuxi 
after 
traveling from Beijing to Jinan and Nanjing. Because the 
whereabouts of the CPC leaders and policymakers are extremely 
secret, it is believed that the enigma about Deng Xiaoping's 
admonition to local officials during his southern tour will not 
be made clear for a certain period of time.

<F P=106> [Report by Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping is likely to spend the 
Lunar New Year in Shanghai, where he is expected to give another 
series of instructions on reform. 
  However, a major theme of Mr Deng's instructions will be 
"party construction", or strengthening the authority of 
Communist Party organizations. 
  The patriarch will also lend his prestige to fighting 
regionalism, which has affected the ability of central 
authorities to implement market reforms. 
  Aside from Mr Deng such senior cadres as premier Li Peng and 
the former member of the Politburo Standing Committee -- Song 
Ping, have recently emphasized strengthening the role of the 
party. 
  As reported in the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST last week, Mr 
Deng went to the Shanghai region this month to hear briefings on 
the economic situation by local leaders. 
  Two Hong Kong publications yesterday reported that the 
patriarch had also gone to cities and resorts near Shanghai 
including Nanjing and Wuxi. 
  Moreover, on his way to the south, Mr Deng had passed 
through 
Jinan and talked to leaders of Shandong. 
  The 89-year-old patriarch also received medical attention at 
a military hospital at Taihu Lake near Wuxi. 
  The publications said Mr Deng discussed improving party 
organizations and "reforming the thinking" of leading party 
cadres. 
  Chinese sources said yesterday Mr Deng had spearheaded 
another round of a crusade centred on party construction, 
campaigns related to which have been waged almost every year 
since the Tiananmen Square crackdown. 
  "Comrade Xiaoping is worried that party organizations are 
crumbling because of the craze of doing business," an informed 
source said. 
  "Moreover, central party leadership is faltering and the 
patriarch fears that radical reforms cannot be implemented 
without a strong centre." 
  While in Shanghai in mid-December, Mr Deng had spoken out on 
the need to "remove all obstacles on the path of reform" as well 
as "cutting down on regionalism and individualism". 
  The patriarch also had sessions with party bosses from 
neighboring cities including Nanjing, Suzhou Wuxi, Xuzhou and 
Lianyungang. 
  Following his practice of the past three years, Mr Deng is 
expected to stay in Shanghai until the Lunar New Year. 
  Meanwhile, the national press yesterday quoted premier Li as 
calling for improved party organizations more obedience to 
central edicts. 
  "Party organizations of all levels must see to it that they 
bring into full play their role as a powerful fighting force and 
that party members play a role as vanguards and models in their 
work," Mr Li said. 
  "We must unify our thinking, and act in keeping with the 
party Central Committee." 
  XINHUA (the New China News Agency) reported that this week, 
Mr Song, a conservative elder, toured Guangdong with a view to 
promoting "the construction of spiritual civilization and the 
party."

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- Li Peng, member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and 
premier of the State Council, held a discussion meeting in the 
Great Hall of the People this afternoon with comrades who 
attended the eighth party work meeting of central government 
organs. He stressed during the discussion: Party organizations 
at various levels across China should earnestly implement the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; further strengthen party building; and make fresh 
contributions to expeditiously establishing a socialist market 
economy, and to enhancing a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  The three-day eighth party work meeting of central 
government 
organs ended today. 
  Luo Gan, state councillor, secretary general of the State 
Council, and secretary of the Work Committee for Central 
Government Organs, chaired the discussion meeting. At the 
meeting, Liu Zhengwei, deputy secretary of the Work Committee 
for Central Government Organs, reported on the eighth party work 
meeting of central government organs. Responsible people of 
party committees of organs under the Ministries of State 
Security and Water Resources and the China National Petroleum 
Corporation successively spoke on ways to strengthen leadership 
in the party organizations of government organs, reform and 
operations in their respective departments, and giving play to 
the roles of the party organizations of government organs. 
  Li Peng said: In 1993, the party organizations at various 
levels of central government organs and the vast number of 
personnel handling party affairs have done a lot of work in 
conscientiously helping departmental party organizations and 
administrative leaders. They have played an important role and 
achieved relatively good results in promoting reform, 
accomplishing departmental work and missions, and waging 
anticorruption struggles. 
  Li Peng expounded the current situation and missions, and 
pointed out that central government organs shoulder important 
responsibilities to deepen reform, develop the economy, and 
safeguard social stability. He said: We must be guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, unify our thinking with the guidelines 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
and the National Economic Work Meeting, and maintain a high 
degree of unanimity with the party central committee so as to 
ensure the smooth implementation of government orders. 
  Li Peng stressed: In the process of establishing a socialist 
market economy, we should correctly handle relations among 
reform, development, and stability to ensure successful 
implementation of various reforms and a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy in 1994. He said: 
Party organizations at various levels should give full play to 
their roles as fighting bastions, give full play to the roles of 
party members as vanguard models, lead the broad masses of 
cadres, staff, and workers; help the leading party groups and 
administrative leaders of various departments to complete all 
missions, and work hard to accomplish various tasks laid down by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
  Li Peng said: Throughout the course of carrying out reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive, we should persistently 
pay attention to reform and economic progress on the one hand, 
and launch an anticorruption campaign and step up the building 
of a socialist spiritual civilization on the other. We should 
persistently uphold the policy of "building both material and 
spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both." 
He urged the leading party groups in various departments to 
provide better guidance for the party work of government organs, 
to earnestly improve the thinking and work style of government 
organs, and to wholeheartedly serve the people with 
down-to-earth, efficient and honest work. He pointed out the 
need to intensify the cultivation of middle-aged and young 
cadres, to strengthen the development of grass-roots party 
organizations, and to implement various tasks all the way down 
to the grass-roots level. 
  Luo Gan said in his speech: In 1994, the party organizations 
of central government organs should understand the situation, 
specify their tasks, and mobilize and organize the broad masses 
of communist party members to lead the campaign to deepen 
reform, develop the economy, safeguard social stability, and to 
play their roles as vanguards and models. They should uphold 
the policy of building both material and spiritual civilizations 
and attaching equal importance to both. They should continually 
deepen the anticorruption struggle, and earnestly improve the 
thinking and work style of government organs. While 
establishing a socialist market economy, they should further 
strengthen and improve the party building of government organs. 
  Attending the discussion meeting were responsible comrades 
of 
the leading party groups of various departments of central 
government organs, responsible comrades of the party committees 
of government organs, and responsible people from relevant 
departments.

<F P=106> [Speech by Qiao Shi at the Fifth Meeting of the Eighth </F>
National People's Congress, NPC, Standing Committee on 29 
December 1993] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- Dear deputy chairmen 
and committee members: 
  After 10 days' hard work, we have completed all scheduled 
tasks. The meeting has heard expositions and opinions on a total 
of 11 draft laws and draft legal decisions. After making 
earnest deliberations, we have adopted resolutions on four laws 
and relevant legal issues. While holding the meeting, we have 
also attended the commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth 
centenary. The adopted Company Law is a very important law in a 
socialist market economy. Its formulation and implementation 
will be a major event in the development of China's legal 
system. The law has an important significance in specifying the 
legal status of companies which are the main bodies of a market, 
in regulating a company's organizations and behavior, in 
establishing a modern enterprise system, and in enhancing the 
healthy development of a socialist market economy. The meeting's 
adoption of the Draft Amendment to the Accountants Law and the 
decision on the applicability of relevant interim taxation 
regulations to foreign-funded and foreign-owned enterprises will 
play an important role in improving the legal system governing 
accountants and the taxation system, in protecting the market's 
economic order, and in improving China's investment environment. 
The meeting has adopted a decision to submit the Draft Budget 
Law to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC for deliberation. 
It has preliminarily deliberated the Draft Foreign Trade Law, 
the Draft Law on Protecting Taiwan Compatriots' Investments, the 
Draft Law on Eugenic and Health Care, and the Draft Provisions 
on Severely Punishing Criminals Who Organize and Smuggle People 
Across China's Borders. It has also heard a report on opinions 
concerning the Draft Securities Law. Furthermore, the meeting 
has heard and deliberated the State Council's reports on the 
work regarding economic relations and trade with foreign 
countries; on improving the safety and work of civil aviation; 
and on inspecting the implementation of the Decision on 
Punishing Crimes of Production and Sales of Fake and Shoddy 
Commodities. 
  The meeting has adopted a decision to hold the Second 
Session 
of the Eighth NPC. We have over two months before the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC is held on 10 March 1994, and we 
should do earnest and down-to-earth preparatory work. We must 
be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line; strive to make the forthcoming session a meeting of 
democracy and unity, as well as a meeting to seek truth, and 
discuss practical problems, opening up, and forging ahead; and 
further mobilize people of various nationalities across China to 
make concerted efforts and seize opportunities to accelerate the 
pace of reform and opening up and bring about sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of the national economy. 
  The year 1993 is approaching its end. Through our joint 
efforts since the First Session of the Eighth NPC was held in 
March 1993, the NPC Standing Committee has made considerable 
progress in economic legislation. We have made 16 decisions on 
formulating and amending laws, and on adopting relevant legal 
issues; 12 of them concerning socialist market economy issues. 
We are intensifying the inspection and supervision of law 
enforcement. The NPC Standing Committee and various special 
committees have successively sent out 33 law-enforcement 
inspection teams to check the implementation of 18 laws and 
decisions, and the inspections had a certain effect. Our work in 
other aspects has also produced good results. 
  The year 1994, which is approaching soon, will be one in 
which we shall face more concentrated tasks of reform and must 
implement in an all-round way the "Decision on Certain Issues 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy" made 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
All reform measures that we take will be of vital importance, 
and therefore they require that we be meticulous and act with 
caution. We must succeed in their implementation; we cannot 
afford to fail. Our fundamental method is to base our work on 
the interests of the masses and to win their understanding and 
support. We must make the masses really understand that 
successful implementation of these reform measures are, in the 
final analysis, beneficial to them and conducive to accelerating 
economic development and to improving the people's living 
standards. In this connection, it is necessary for the NPC and 
the people's congresses at all levels to look upon expediting 
the implementation of various reform measures as their own 
tasks, to conduct surveys and study by immersing themselves 
among the masses and by going deep into the realities of life, 
to listen attentively to the views of the masses, to show 
concern for the masses who encounter temporary difficulties, to 
take notice of and understand various factors that may possibly 
affect social stability and the smooth progress of reform at all 
times, and to actively help the putting forward of constructive 
views on solving various problems under the leadership of the 
party. Meanwhile, they must supervise the implementation of all 
reform measures which have been adopted according to the law, 
take the initiative in a timely manner to make suggestions on 
improving our work, and unite and lead the masses of the people 
to successfully fulfill our reform tasks during the whole year. 
  In 1994, the people's congress standing committees must 
continue to place legislation and, in particular, economic 
legislation at the top of their agenda. They must make efforts 
to closely coordinate legislative work with the steps of reform 
and use laws to guide, promote, and protect reform in accordance 
with the requirements set by the "decision" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. They must in a 
timely manner sum up the experiences gained from implementing 
adopted reform measures, and they must finalize and standardize 
them by using as many legal forms as possible. They must make a 
clear distinction between the order of importance and urgency of 
the laws to be made next year, make proper arrangements, and 
create the laws that are badly needed ahead of other laws. For 
example, laws on finance, banking, bank bills, and securities 
are more urgent than others, and close attention should be paid 
to their legislation. 
  To carry out major legislative work in a planned way and to 
enable a framework of the legal system for a socialist market 
economy to evolve during the current tenure of the people's 
congresses, the [NPC] Standing Committee is mapping out a five- 
year legislation plan and is taking vigorous steps to this end. 
The five years are an important period for China to accelerate 
the establishment of a socialist market economy; all fields of 
endeavor call for the formulation of a number of laws. A 
legislation plan must be based on the Constitution; it must take 
into consideration both the possibilities of the realities and 
the objective needs of reform, opening up, and modernization; 
and it must make the focal points stand out while giving 
consideration to other points. The current [people's congress] 
standing committees must treat as their primary task the effort 
to formulate the laws on standardizing the main part of the 
market, maintaining market order, strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and improving the social security 
system. Meanwhile, they must also make arrangements for the 
legislation of the laws on strengthening the building of 
socialist democracy, improving the system for the organization 
of state organs, punishing criminals for various criminal 
activities, maintaining social order; promoting the development 
of education, science, and culture; protecting our environment, 
and strengthening the national defense buildup. In addition, 
they must amend or abolish at the right moment laws incompatible 
with the establishment of a socialist market economy. It is 
necessary for all departments to make concerted efforts and to 
coordinate closely with each other to map out a legislative 
plan. The people's congress standing committees must strengthen 
guidance for legislative work and work successfully in 
coordinating and supervising the drafting of laws under the 
unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee. We definitely 
must acquire a new concept compatible with the socialist market 
economy, conduct intensive study of the new situations and new 
problems existing in the realities of life, boldly explore and 
practice, and solve the difficulties and problems encountered in 
legislation with the spirit of reform so that legislation can 
catch up with the pace of reform and opening up. 
  After a law is enacted, it must be resolutely implemented. 
The failure to implement an enacted law is tantamount to the 
nonexistence of the law. The basic principle of our socialist 
legal system is to have laws, abide by the law, strictly enforce 
the law, and see to it that violators of the law are punished. 
To ensure a sound legal system, none of these four links are 
dispensable. Because China has a history of several thousand 
years of feudal society, people have a relatively weak sense of 
law. Some comrades are accustomed to relying on administrative 
means to manage economic and social affairs, and they do not 
attach sufficient importance to the role of the law. Some of 
them even abuse power and openly violate the law merely to 
benefit their own localities, departments, or organizations. 
Such a practice is incompatible with the establishment of a 
socialist market economy. So, we must not only pay attention to 
legislation. We must also attach great importance to 
implementing laws and ensure that everything is done strictly 
according to the law. Great efforts should be made to improve 
the situation of some departments, cadres and, people who "know 
nothing about the law, know about it but fail to implement it at 
all, or fail to implement it strictly." Comrade Xiaoping has 
pointed out that an important thing in strengthening the legal 
system is to carry out education, and it is necessary to enhance 
the sense of law among the people. We should strive to 
publicize the law and make it known to as many people as 
possible. Television and radio stations, newspapers, journals, 
and other media should make it their day-to-day important work 
to publicize the law. All departments and localities should 
persistently publicize the legal system to educate the cadres 
and the people, and to increase their sense of law and their 
ability to act according to the law. It is necessary to 
establish the authority of the PRC Constitution and other laws 
in society, and to ensure that the Constitution and other laws 
are implemented to the letter. Leading organs and leading 
cadres in particular should take the lead in studying, 
understanding, and abiding by the law, and know how to manage 
economic and social affairs according to the law. It is also 
necessary to keep improving the judicial system and the 
administration's law-enforcement mechanisms, and to raise the 
standards of both. The people's congress standing committees at 
all levels should attach importance to inspecting and 
supervising the implementation of laws. The stress of the 
inspection for a period to come should be placed on major issues 
concerning reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, as 
well as the issues about which the people have strong 
complaints. More attention should be paid to inspecting and 
supervising the implementation of the laws concerning the 
socialist market economy and striving to improve the results of 
inspection. If any problem is discovered, the departments 
concerned should be urged to resolve it seriously so as to win 
the people's trust. In short, we should conscientiously carry 
out the duties bestowed on us by the PRC Constitution and other 
laws. We should work in a down-to-earth way to make greater 
progress in promoting the socialist democracy and legal system. 
I hope that our comrades will make their due contributions 
during the struggle waged by the whole party and the people 
across the country to win new victories in reform and 
construction next year. 
  Last, because New Year's Day is just around the corner, I 
would like to take this opportunity to say Happy New Year to 
you. Thank you.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Yang Zhou, dissident 
founder of the China "Peace Charter" movement, was freed late 
last week after being held in detention for seven weeks, he said 
Monday. Yang, 49, from Shanghai, was arrested in Beijing on 
November 15, the day after the signing by nine dissidents of a 
document calling for multi-party politics and democracy in China. 
  He was initially placed in a detention centre in Beijing but 
was transferred December 5 to one in Shanghai, he told AFP by 
telephone. 
  "After I have recuperated a bit, because my health 
deteriorated in prison, I plan to resume my activities with the 
Peace Charter and also with the human rights movement set up 
last year in Shanghai and which we want to get officially 
registered," he said, following his release on Friday. 
  Yang, who has always been in the forefront of the struggle 
to 
defend human rights in China, spent two years in jail for his 
role during the 1979 Democracy Wall movement. He was also the 
author of a letter written in 1990 to Communist Party Secretary 
General Jiang Zemin calling for the liberation of all political 
prisoners. Yang said he had no news of another Peace Charter 
signatory, Qin Yongmin, from Wuhan, central China, who was also 
arrested on November 15. 
  Ma Shaohua and Zheng Xuguang, two human rights activists and 
members of a monitoring group in Xian, central China, were 
questioned two weeks later for holding a meeting in Beijing with 
Charter dissidents. During that meeting the two movements 
decided to coordinate their efforts to promote democracy by 
legal and non- violent means. Their initiatives on these issues 
were the most significant since the crushing of the 1989 
democracy movement in Beijing.

  [Text] Shanghai, Jan. 3 KYODO -- Chinese authorities have 
released a prominent human rights activist who was detained in 
November after unveiling a draft "Peace Charter" promoting 
political reform. 
  Yang Zhou, 49, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in a telephone 
interview that he was taken into custody in Beijing on November 
14 and held through December 31 at detention centers in both 
Beijing and Shanghai. He said he was treated badly at both 
centers. 
  Yang was among nine people taken into custody after signing 
the draft charter intended to stimulate a national dialogue on 
bringing democracy to China. 
  All were released the following day except for Yang and 
another dissident Qin Yongmin. Qin, from the central city of 
Wuhan, gained attention earlier for campaigning against 
Beijing's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. His whereabouts are 
unknown. 
  Yang said the charter aims to promote nonviolent political 
reform in China in contrast to some pro-democracy groups that 
advocate violent revolution to achieve their goals. 
  The charter advocates nonviolence and cooperation with the 
Communist Party, which it describes as the only force capable of 
leading a peaceful transition to democracy. 
  It also calls for increasing individual rights, striking 
political crimes from the legal code and releasing political 
prisoners. 
  Yang, who is from Shanghai, was previously jailed for three 
years for his role in the democracy wall protest movement of the 
late 1970s.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- China has achieved 
marked progress in regional social development levels in various 
fields, according to the results of a comprehensive assessment 
of regional social development levels released today. Beijing, 
Shanghai, and Tianjin topped the list in terms of high 
comprehensive levels of social development, while Anhui, 
Qinghai, and Guizhou were ranked among the top three in terms of 
growth rates of comprehensive levels of social development. 
  According to a State Statistics Bureau briefing, 
comprehensive levels of social development are indexes of 
regional and overall social development calculated on the basis 
of the weighted average of figures for all fields of social 
development for the purpose of presenting a comprehensive 
picture of social development in a given country or region. 
This assessment -- which is based on 1992 statistics and uses 
the method of multistage consolidation [duo ji zong he fang fa 
1122 4787 4844 0678 2455 3127] -- covers more than 100 
statistical indicators in ten fields, including the environment, 
population, economics, living standards, and levels of 
scientific and technical education that reflect China's overall 
levels of social development. 
  The results of the assessment indicate that China's average 
social development level index in 1992 reached 121, an increase 
of 10 percent over 1991. Fourteen provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities are above the national average in 
terms of comprehensive levels of social development. The 
assessment also reveals some new characteristics in China's 
social development in 1992: China's social development 
basically kept pace with the development of the economy; China's 
gross domestic product registered an increase of 13.2 percent in 
1992, while the average social development level index rose by 
10 percent, basically keeping pace with the former. Large gaps 
exist from region to region. Excluding Beijing, Tianjin, and 
Shanghai, the average social development level index of the five 
highest-ranked regions is 60 percent higher than that of the 
five lowest-ranked regions. The level of social development was 
higher in eastern and coastal open areas. Thirteen out of the 
14 regions -- Shanxi Province is the exception -- which enjoy 
index figures greater than the national average are from eastern 
or coastal open areas. Regions with relatively low average 
social development levels saw faster growth; twelve of the 
fifteen regions with index figures below the national average 
reached or topped the national growth rate for 1992. 
  An analysis of the results reveals uneven development from 
sector to sector in 1992. Nationally, the index figures of 
population, economy, hygiene and health care, social security, 
public order, and living standards saw large increases; the 
environment and scientific and technical education index figures 
registered slight progress; and the labor index figures declined.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese courts at 
all level stepped up their efforts to handle impartially cases 
involving companies from foreign countries and from Taiwan, Hong 
Kong and Macao in 1993. 
  Many special courts were set up to handle such cases, said 
Gao Changli, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, at 
the national conference of presidents of higher people's court, 
which ended here today. 
  "The courts protect the legal rights of all parties 
involved, 
without discrimination against any side, helping create a better 
legal environment for China's opening up to the world," said Gao. 
  With more investments coming to China's mainland, and the 
development of foreign trade and economic co-operation, the 
economic cases concerning outside companies have been surging in 
China's border and coastal regions, Gao noted. 
  He said the number of such economic and maritime cases in 
1993 increased by 36.6 percent and 41.33 percent, respectively 
over the year before. 
  President of the Higher Court of Shanghai Hu Ruibang said 
that the Shanghai courts have been exercising independent 
judicial power in economic cases concerning foreign companies, 
in accordance to China's laws and the international conventions 
China is a party to, and in line with the norms of international 
conduct. 
  In handling cases concerning companies from Taiwan, Hong 
Kong 
and Macao, Chinese laws and policies are adhered to, he said. 
  The overriding principle for the courts is to protect 
equally 
the legal rights of all parties, Hu said. 
  The Shanghai courts also make efforts to make Chinese laws 
known to the foreign business people, the judge said. 
  He offered an example: A Swedish company decided to withdraw 
its business from Shanghai after it was sued by a Chinese 
company, because of suspicion it would be discriminated against 
by a Chinese court. 
  However, Hu said, after the mediation of a Shanghai court, 
the two companies reached an agreement. 
  The Swedish company's confidence was boosted and it decided 
to invest further in Shanghai, Hu said. 
  President of the Shenzhen Intermediate Court Wang Changying 
said a special court, the second economic court, has been 
established to handle cases concerning foreign companies or 
companies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. It is the first of 
its kind in China, he noted. 
  He explained that this is part of the judiciary's efforts to 
safeguard and promote the reform and opening up of China's 
leading special economic zone. 
  The court has so far handled 700 cases, with 900 million 
yuan 
(about 112 million U.S. dollars) involved, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (CNS) -- The population 
problem in China remains critical this year because of various 
factors and in spite of the fact that the state-level and 
provincial departments concerned as well as individual cities 
had adopted many measures to strengthen family planning. 
  Considerable progress was made in population control across 
the country in 1992 when the national birth rate dropped by 1.44 
per 1,000 with the gross population registering only slight 
growth with 4.96 million fewer babies born than the expected 
increase. Some provinces and autonomous regions had a good 
performance in carrying out family planning. In Shandong 
Province, the planned birth rate rose by 5.3 percent in the 
first five months this year over the same period last year, the 
rate of late marriages by 21.3 percent and late pregnancies by 
25.8 percent. In Shanxi Province, the birth rate dropped by 
0.98 per 1,000 and the natural growth rate of population by 0.69 
per 1,000 in the first half of this year over the same period 
last year. In Yunnan Province, the birth rate was reduced by 
2.24 percent and unplanned children born by 30 percent in the 
first nine months of this year over the same period last year. 
With difficulties becoming serious in the population census in 
the past two years and the survey receiving artificial 
disruptions, an annual population increase of 1.9 million is not 
taken into account in the census. 
  A sample survey conducted by the State Family Planning 
Commission in 16 villages in each of Hebei and Hubei provinces 
last October showed that most of the 32 villages had failed to 
report births and early marriages as well as pregnancies and the 
heavy rate of births constituted serious problems. Birth 
figures reported to the authorities may not necessarily reflect 
the actual situation. The State Family Planning Commission has 
paid much attention to this problem while experts have pointed 
out that population control should be carried out by setting up 
an administrative system in line with the socialist market 
economy.

  [Text] The Beijing Planning and Construction Commission 
held a chairman's meeting on 17 December. Chairman Chen Xitong 
stressed: Beijing's new overall urban plan indicates that the 
urban planning and construction of Beijing has entered a new 
stage, and it must be upheld strictly upheld. 
  This meeting was the first chairman office meeting since the 
readjustment of the component members of the Beijing Planning 
and Construction Commission. Chen Xitong, member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of 
the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, continues to serve as 
chairman of the commission; Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing 
Municipality, serves as first vice chairman of the commission; 
and Hou Jie, minister of construction, Zhang Baifa and Wang 
Baosen, executive vice mayors of Beijing, Zhang Kezhi, deputy 
secretary general of the State Council, Yao Zhenyan, vice 
chairman of the State Planning Commission, Liu Mingpu, deputy 
director of the General Logistics Department of the People's 
Liberation Army, Chu Chuanheng, former vice minister of 
construction and chief planner, and Xuan Xiangliu, secretary 
general of the Beijing Planning and Construction Commission, 
serve as vice chairmen of the commission. Zhao Zhijing serves 
as director of the office of the Beijing Planning and 
Construction Commission. 
  The meeting's participants listened to the report made by Ke 
Huanzhang, president of the Beijing Research Institute for Urban 
Planning and Design, on implementing the written reply of the 
State Council on Beijing's new overall urban plan. Beijing 
Municipality will muster an appropriate period of time next year 
to energetically publicize this plan to make every household 
aware of it. 
  Chen Xitong said in his speech: The important written reply 
of the State Council on Beijing's new overall urban plan is 
great support and encouragement to future construction and 
development in Beijing. The new overall plan is a trans-century 
project suiting the new situation of carrying out reform and 
opening up, establishing the socialist market economy, and 
accelerating the development of urban areas. He said: Planning 
is the dragon's head of construction and development and is an 
important lesson. Thus, we should conscientiously study and 
explore it. When viewed from the experiences gained from our 
practice and from the experiences gained by some cities in 
foreign countries, overall planning must be strictly upheld 
without any confusion. In carrying out the plan, we must have a 
hard heart and strict demand and should not be afraid of giving 
offense. Anyone obstructing this plan should not be tolerated 
and no one should change the plan. Overall planning for the 
capital is all the more influential and thus, it should be 
upheld in an even stricter manner. Beijing must depend on the 
guidance of the Ministry of Construction and on the endeavor of 
all fields to build itself well in line with better planning 
under the leadership of the central authorities. 
  Li Qiyan said in his speech: Urban construction and 
development of Beijing has garnered the great support of various 
central party, government, and military departments. We hope 
that these departments will continue to vigorously support the 
implementation of the State Council's written reply and 
Beijing's new overall plan.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472) and Correspondent </F>
Xia Lixin (1115 7787 2450) "It Is Necessary To Create a New 
Situation in Training and Promoting Minority Cadres"] 
  [Text] Leading personnel at all levels throughout the 
municipality should fully discern the significance of training 
and promoting minority cadres and adopt realistic measures to 
create a new situation in this regard. This is the content 
stressed by Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, in his speech made at the municipal work conference 
on 16 December on training and promoting minority cadres. 
  The work conference is chiefly aimed at discussing and 
arranging the work of how to do a good job in training and 
promoting minority cadres in the course of accelerating reform, 
opening up, and economic construction in the 1990's. It is 
aimed at summarizing and exchanging the achievements and 
experience gained by the municipality in the work of handling 
the affairs of minority cadres and at putting forward specific 
opinions and demands for the municipality to train and promote 
minority cadres. 
  In his speech Chen Xitong pointed out: A fraternal relation 
is existing among various nationalities throughout our country. 
Both minority nationalities and Han Nationality are the member 
of the large Chinese national family and are brothers-in-arms. 
An equal relation also exists among them. Therefore, they 
should support and assist one another and in commonly become 
prosperous, developed, and well-off. It is imperative to deal 
with the relationship between minority nationalities and Han 
Nationality correctly. By no means should we indulge in Han 
chauvinism. 
  Chen Xitong said: Beijing Municipality has 410,000 persons 
of minority population that accounts for 3.8 percent in the 
total municipal population. The residence of minority people in 
Beijing has significance. Success with Beijing, the country's 
capital, in dealing with the relation between Han Nationality 
and fraternal minority nationalities will influence the country 
as a whole and even the world. Localities throughout the country 
are watching whether our country is as good as its word in 
enforcing its policies on nationalities' affairs. If Beijing is 
successful in enforcing the policies on nationalities' affairs 
that will be a good influence on the unity among various 
fraternal nationalities throughout the country. Localities that 
have minority residents should encourage their cadres of Han 
Nationality to do a good job with relations between them and 
minority cadres, and in fostering unity between them. This is a 
sign indicating whether or not leading personnel at all levels 
have the art of leadership. 
  Chen Xitong stressed: The work of training and promoting 
minority cadres relates to the whole situation. The hostile 
forces are adopting various measures in an effort to whip up the 
national split and to endanger the social stability, 
nationalities' unity, and the country's unification. Only by 
realistically enhancing the party's leadership and making 
efforts to train a large number of minority cadres who have both 
ability and political integrity, resolutely support the 
country's unification and nationalities' unity, maintain a close 
tie with the mass, and are reliable in leading the minority 
people and fostering unity among them, will we be able to 
withstand many a storm or test. The harmony in the people of Han 
nationality, minority nationalities and the family style unity 
fostered by them in Beijing are just. Because of them, there are 
a large number of representative personages and leading cadres 
of minority nationalities, who have done a great deal of work in 
safeguarding the country's unification and nationalities' unity. 
During the forum sponsored by Chen Xitong with voters in Xuanwu 
district, a compatriot of Hui Nationality said: There are 
bounds among various nationalities but there are no bounds in 
serving the people. Such splendid words from him have fully 
reflected that the compatriots of minority nationalities in 
Beijing are conscious. Party committees at all levels in 
localities with minority population should attach special 
importance to training and promoting minority cadres and further 
expanding the proportion of minority cadres, including the 
proportion of deputies to people's congress and leading cadres. 
Efforts should be made to train new successors for these 
minority cadres and to adopt realistic measures to vigorously 
train the younger cadres of minority nationalities. The 
religious circles, the specialized organs in charge of minority 
nationalities' affairs, and the governmental organs at all 
levels should pay great attention to the work. They should 
formulate a work plan at an early date and must create a new 
situation when training minority cadres next year. 
  Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, presided over and addressed the work conference. In 
his speech he urged various fronts and departments to summarize 
their work in training minority cadres, to find out their 
shortcomings, to define the work emphasis for the future, and to 
do a good job in conducting the work in a planned manner and in 
line with the set programs. 
  Delivering reports at the work conference were Shen Daoren, 
director of the united front work department under the municipal 
party committee; and Sha Zhyuan, director of the municipal civil 
affairs commission. 
  Attending the work conference were Chen Hong, vice minister 
of nationalities' affairs, and Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of 
the municipal party committee.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday was New Year's Day of 1994. While the 
people across the province were celebrating their festival, 
Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee; 
Governor Ye Liansong; Li Zhanshu, member of the provincial party 
standing committee; and Guo Hongqi, vice governor of the 
province, inspected markets in the seat of Yuanshi County. 
Riding in the same bus for the inspection tours were leading 
personnel from Shijiazhuang city and responsible comrades from 
the provincial industry and commerce bureau, the provincial 
grains bureau, and the provincial commodity price bureau. 
  At 0830 yesterday Cheng Weigao said to the accompanied 
personnel as soon as he got on the bus: Our inspection emphasis 
will be concentrated on the problem of injecting water into 
meat. Ye Liansong said: Regardless, injecting water into pork 
or chicken is illegal. Cheng Weigao said: He never knows the 
water injection of pork and it is a really fantastic story. 
Injecting water into pork means to replace meat with water and 
to use trickery. Such cases must be strictly handled as soon as 
they have been exposed. 
  At about 0900 that day, the bus arrived at the seat of 
Yuanshi County. Cheng Weigao, Ye Liansong, and the accompanied 
personnel walked along the street after they were off of the bus 
and inspected, one by one, the stands and shops on both sides of 
the street. When inspecting the pork markets, Cheng Weigao and 
Ye Liansong held talks with the butcher, named (Cui Kou), who is 
more than 60 years old and has been in the meat business over 
the past twelve years. All meat he has sold is from his own 
hogs and bought by him from outside places. He was not aware of 
the inspection conducted by the provincial leadership. Cheng 
Weigao asked him whether his pork had been injected with water. 
While continuously chopping his meat, (Cui Kou) answered: No, 
no, I never do that and never do things mean. Ye Liansong asked 
him whether he has bought diseased hogs. (Cui Kou) said: I 
have bought two hogs of that kind. Ye Liansong asked how he 
handled them and whether he had sold them. He stopped chopping 
his meat this time, (Cui Kou) said: Such pork must not be sold 
and I have handled all of them. I would lose a family fortune 
if such a sale were exposed. 
  After consecutively inspecting several meat stands and 
shops, 
the leading personnel discovered no meat with injected water and 
the meat prices were relatively rational. 
  After leaving the meat markets, Cheng Weigao and other 
personnel went into a meat foodstuffs center run by a couple 
whose boss is called (Zhang Liguo). After inquiring about the 
channels of ordering goods, pork prices, and profit situation, 
Cheng Weigao said to him: Being the managers of an 
individually run business, you should first pay attention to 
stressing professional ethics, food sanitation, and credit. 
  On the afternoon that day, leading personnel including Cheng 
Weigao entered the first grains and cooking oil center under the 
Yuanshi County Grains Storehouse just as soon as its doors were 
opened. They discovered a plate with rational prices of grains 
and cooking oil and were satisfied with the center's genuine 
goods at a fair price. 
  After their inspection activities, Cheng Weigao and Ye 
Liansong were interviewed by the reporters. Cheng Weigao said: 
Today is New Year's Day. During the new year the central 
authorities will accelerate their pace in reform that is aimed 
at developing productive forces and upgrading the people's 
living standard. Therefore, in conducting reform, units at all 
levels should safeguard the vital interest of the people and do 
a good job in dealing with the problems that should not occur. 
For example, pork has been injected with water and steamed buns 
have been cooked with sulfur. All of this has been caused by 
the bureaucracy. There are almost 1,000 personnel in the 
Shijiazhuang city industry and commerce bureau and how could 
these personnel fail to successfully deal with these problems? 
He declared on the spot that we will find the industry and 
commerce bureau to blame for the recurrence of such problems and 
that will prove that leadership has not performed its duties 
totally and effectively. [passage omitted)

  [Text] Tianjin, January 3 (XINHUA) -- Total import and 
export trade volume achieved through Tianjin port last year 
topped about 10 billion U.S. dollars-worth, almost 20 percent 
more than in 1992, according to figures just released by the 
Tianjin customs department. 
  Among imported commodities through the port, automobiles, 
rolled steel, metal cutting machinery, tools and equipment 
needed by overseas-funded enterprises here in China have seen a 
large growth. 
  Meanwhile, the amount of imported fertilizers, plastic 
materials and paper pulp went down by a big margin last year. 
  Last year also saw more clothes, Coke and cashmere made and 
produced in China flow into the international market through 
Tianjin port, while less grain, aquatic products and pig-iron 
were exported. 
  Northern China's provinces still held the largest share in 
the import and export trade through Tianjin port, although that 
of southern and central China provinces has increased somewhat. 
  Tianjin port now has a throughput capacity of about 35 
million tons with more than 40 deep-water berths and China's 
largest container wharf. 
  As the drive of economic reform and opening-up is stepping 
up, more and more interior provinces and cities in north and 
west China, including Beijing, find Tianjin port most ideal for 
their imports and exports.

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch" report from the station's theoretical </F>
reporter from the province's rural work conference: "How To 
Help Peasants Hold Their Ground in Markets"] 
  [Text] For people throughout Liaoning, the year of 1993 is 
inspiring. As of 1993, the province has consecutively 
stabilized its grain output of more than 15 billion kg in the 
last four years. The province has basically become 
self-supporting in its supply of grains and major nonstaple 
foodstuffs. The long-standing economic pattern with its large 
portion of industrial production and small agricultural 
production portion has incurred fundamental change. This is a 
historical breakthrough made by the province in its economic 
development. However, the major topic discussed at the 
provincial rural work conference was not aimed at maintaining 
the achievements. Opinions raised at provincial rural work 
conferences by attendants from units at province, city, county, 
and district levels were concentrated on how to guide peasants 
to enter markets and how to deal with the deep-rooted problems 
of rural areas. 
  During the discussion at the provincial rural work 
conference 
(Ding Zhonghuo), mayor of Kaiyuan city, described problems they 
ran into the city's called on peasants to plant a large number 
of hawthorn trees and to greatly develop the production of wild 
sesame over the past few years in order to help peasants 
increase their incomes. It was unfortunate that the 7.5 million 
tonnes of hawthorns produced this year were not sold out and 
peasants who had engaged in the cultivation of wild sesame also 
suffered losses. Thus, the government's good deeds for the 
people have ended in complaints being heard everywhere. 
  After hearing the speech made at the discussion by the mayor 
of Kaiyuan city, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, said: This experience shows us that we no longer 
need to do such things without [words indistinct]. He urged 
leading personnel at all levels to make more efforts in the 
future to study the affairs of markets, to establish markets, 
and to do a good job in conducting market management. Efforts 
should be made to reduce the blindness in the rural work and to 
deal with in a down-to-earth manner, the problems encountered by 
peasants who have already entered markets so as to enable 
peasants to hold their ground in markets. 
  In discussing the issue of developing secondary and tertiary 
industries during the provincial work conference, the 
participating personnel from various counties and districts 
generally professed a shortage of funds. (Zhang Hong), 
secretary of the Dongming district party committee in Shenyang, 
voiced his opinions during the discussion and said: The 80 
percent of investments made in the secondary and tertiary 
industries of Dongming district in 1993 come from funds raised 
by peasants. Participants at the discussion were surprised by 
continuously nodding their head. Many participating comrades 
said: Developing secondary and tertiary industries at county 
and district levels by depending on banks, loans, and [words 
indistinct] is not a good long-term method. We should share 
development with rural areas and develop systems of shareholding 
and cooperation in rural areas with peasants who possess funds. 
  It was pointed out at the discussion that currently, the 
slow 
progress in purchasing grains was a prominent problem that will 
result in large differences in grain prices. Turning the 
contract for purchasing fixed-quota grains into an economic 
contract for procuring grains will cause deep-rooted problems of 
distrust between the government and peasants. In citing the 
issue of how to establish a rational mechanism of grain purchase 
and sale to foster the mechanism of the province's grain 
markets, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
put forward the following three principles: 1) Efforts should 
be made not only to take the state interests into consideration 
but also to give more profits to peasants. 2) Attention should 
be paid to building small cities that may serve as bridges to 
the advance of rural areas into markets. 3) Efforts should be 
made to regard changes in several rural policies as supportive, 
keep up with the ideological education conducted among peasants, 
make formal deals with peasants, and refrain from neglecting the 
ideological education of peasants.

  [Text] The provincial rural work conference ended in 
Shenyang on 29 December. Attending the work conference were 
leading personnel from the provincial party committee, the 
provincial people's congress, the provincial people's 
government, and the provincial Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference committee, including Gu Jinchi, Yue 
Qifeng, Quan Shuren, Sun Qi, Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, 
Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Xu Wencai, Wen Shizhen, Yu Junbo, Xaio 
Zuofu, (Nie Zhaohong), Zhao Qi, and (Sun Yukun). 
  Governor Yue Qifeng presided over today's session of the 
work 
conference at which Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, delivered a report entitled "Emancipate Minds and 
Deepen the Reform To Improve Agriculture and the Rural Economy 
to a New Level". 
  In his report Gu Jinchi said: Over the past few years, our 
province has consecutively reaped a bumper harvest in 
agriculture and created a new record in grain production every 
year. It has achieved stable development in the production of 
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline cultivation, and fishery. 
It has also made a historical breakthrough in developing 
township enterprises. Such achievements scored the province 
have resulted from earnestly implementing the party's line, 
principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee; and from emancipating minds, 
changing the concept, and following a correct road. These 
achievements have also resulted from the arduous struggle 
launched by the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the 
province. He said: Firmly regarding agriculture as a 
foundation in conducting economic construction represents the 
fundamentally guiding ideology fostered by our party in a long 
time and also represents an important component of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The prominent 
role played by agriculture in Liaoning Province that is with a 
large proportion of industrial production and a large number of 
urban population has become more obvious. He stressed: The 
party committee at city and county levels should give its 
working emphasis and major energy to the rural work. Following 
the rural work conference, various localities should go into 
action immediately to implement in a down- to-earth manner the 
spirit of the work conference and do a good job in conducting 
the work in various fields for the winter-spring period.

  [Text] On New Year's Eve, the border-defense inspection 
station at the Bayuquan Harbor in Yingkou city cracked down on 
an illegal emigration case by cooperating with the departments 
concerned. 
  On 12 December six persons, including (Wu Yanguang) and 
(Wang 
Xingwu), from Changting County in Fujian Province, flew to 
Dalian from Fuzhou. The trip was arranged by (Zheng Yuguan), 
head of a local illegal emigration ring. They were waiting to 
leave the country there. A certain individual called Wang, 
head of the illegal ring at the Bayuquan Harbor, hid the six 
illegal emigrants in the cargo hold of a foreign ship on the 
early morning of 18 December after his several-day scheme. 
When the foreign ship was sailing on the sea area of Yantai, 
the ship's crew discovered the stowaways. In line with the 
relevant regulations, the ship's captain handed over the six 
illegal emigrants to the embankment inspection station. Upon 
receiving the report sent by the embankment inspection station 
of Yantai, the border-defense inspection station at the Bayuquan 
Harbor dispatched its personnel to Yantai to take the stowaways 
back, captured the individual called Wang and detained him for 
investigation, and cooperated with the local public security 
organs in line with the clues confessed by the stowaways. The 
case is being further investigated.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- A negotiating team from 
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] 
held working negotiations with the Straits Exchange Foundation 
[SEF] in Taibei [Taipei] from 18-22 December on implementing 
agreements pertaining to the Gu-Wang talks. They specifically 
discussed the issue of repatriating hijackers across the Taiwan 
Strait. A reporter interviewed an ARATS official on this issue. 
  The official said: The recent round of negotiations focused 
on the repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Strait. 
During the negotiations, we made substantial progress and 
achieved major consensus. The two sides unanimously held that 
hijacking airliners through violent, coercive, or other means is 
a serious crime, that it should be punished sternly, and 
hijackers should, in principle, be repatriated without 
exception. On the basis of this understanding and through 
serious consultations, the two sides initially laid out the 
basic stylistic framework for an agreement on cross-strait 
repatriation of hijackers while leaving the language of such an 
agreement to further discussion. 
  According to the official, the basic stylistic framework for 
an agreement on cross-strait repatriation of hijackers covers, 
by and large, the scope of applicability, the principles of 
repatriation, compulsory measures, repatriation requests and 
methods, and handovers. It is understood the agreement will 
apply to people on either side of the Taiwan Strait who hijack 
an airliner from one side and divert it to the other through 
violent, coercive, or other means. In principle, Mazu and Mawei 
will be used as handover points in any seaborne repatriation 
operation; the two sides also agreed to select Jinmen and Xiamen 
as handover points in light of their actual needs. 
  According to the official, negotiators from the two 
organizations signaled the need for their organizations to carry 
on negotiations on the issue of repatriating hijackers at an 
early date and to hold further consultations on the wording of 
several clauses in the related document in the interest of 
reaching an agreement at an early date.

"March Toward the Future With Full Confidence -- A New Year's 
Speech by Jiang Zemin To Be Broadcast Over China Radio 
International to Listeners Abroad and to Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan Compatriots"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- Ladies, gentlemen, and 
friends: 
  On the occasion of the beginning of 1994, I am very glad to 
extend, through China Radio International, my sincere New Year's 
greetings to people and friends in every other country, to 
Taiwan compatriots, to Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and to 
overseas Chinese friends and foreign friends of Chinese descent. 
I wish you success in everything and family happiness in the 
year ahead. 
  Friends, the past year has been a year in which the Chinese 
people, working under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line, continued their triumphant advance in 
accordance with the strategic policy decision to seize the 
opportunity to deepen reform and bring about rapid and healthy 
development. It has also been a year in which major progress 
was made in implementing the decision of our party's 14th 
National Congress on establishing a socialist market economy. 
China is now enjoying economic growth, political stability, 
national unity, and social progress. Facts show that the line, 
principles, and policies formulated by our party and government 
for economic and social development are correct. Facts also show 
that the experience of our party and government in keeping the 
overall development situation under control and in improving 
their macro guidance is becoming richer and more mature. The 
tasks we shoulder are very arduous and we still face 
difficulties and problems in our advance, but we have the means 
and abilities to overcome them. We will begin the new year and 
march toward a bright future with even fuller confidence and 
greater strides. 
  Building socialism with Chinese characteristics means 
adherence to the policy of reform and opening up to the outside 
world -- the only way to develop contemporary China -- to build 
our country into a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modern 
socialist country with the persistent hard work of several 
generations. To shake off poverty and backwardness and achieve 
a prosperity in our motherland is a common aspiration which all 
the Chinese people and the entire Chinese nation longing day and 
night to realize. China is a large, oriental country with a 
history of 5,000 years of civilization and a population of some 
1.1 billion. A prosperous and strong China will not only 
contribute to the happiness of the Chinese people and Chinese 
nation. It will contribute even more to the civilization of all 
mankind. China's stability and development cannot be separated 
from the peace and development of the world as a whole, and vice 
versa; this has become the common understanding of more and more 
people. 
  Friends, the present world is in a period of transition from 
an old to a new structure. On the one hand, some positive 
tendencies have appeared in international relations, the process 
of multi- polarization of the world is being accelerated, and 
the people of all countries in general are demanding detente and 
cooperation. On the other hand, the world is still far from 
peaceful. The contradictions in some regions have intensified, 
resulting in turmoil and endless armed conflicts. Hegemonism 
and power politics are still very conspicuous, seriously 
challenging world peace and development. The Chinese Government 
and people, firmly adhering to an independent and peaceful 
foreign policy, have played an important role in the complex, 
changing international situation and made positive contributions 
to promoting peace and development in the world. China's 
international prestige has risen remarkably, its international 
environment has been further improved, and we have friends all 
over the world. The world is varied and colorful. Any country 
should respect the right of people in other countries to 
maintain independence and keep the initiative in their own 
hands. A strong, big, and rich country can never achieve its 
goal by bullying a weak, smaller, and poor country, and will 
only end up hurting itself. China will never seek hegemony, and 
its development will not constitute a threat to any country. We 
will, as always, persistently develop friendly and cooperative 
relations with other countries on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence, and make unremitting efforts 
to build a peaceful, stable, fair, and rational new 
international order. 
  It is the sacred mission of the whole Chinese people, 
including our Taiwan compatriots, to complete the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland. Peaceful reunification is also 
the general trend in the development of China's history. People 
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are longing for 
reunification. Any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, 
one Taiwan," and "one China, two governments" goes against the 
aspirations and fundamental interests of people on both sides of 
the Taiwan Strait. It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities 
will follow the general trend and the people's aspirations, put 
national interests above all, do more solid work for the 
reunification of the motherland, and together with the mainland 
create a more prosperous China. The dates when Hong Kong and 
Macao will return to the motherland are approaching. Due to the 
fact that the British side persists in its wrong stand on the 
Hong Kong issue, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong have broken 
down. This is something that we did not want to see. No matter 
what happens, we share the feelings and aspirations of the 
patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. Our policy of "one country, 
two systems" will not change, our principal stand of adhering to 
the Basic Law on Hong Kong will not change, and our resolve to 
restore China's sovereignty over Hong Kong will not change. We 
are fully confident that we have the ability to keep Hong Kong 
prosperous and stable for a long time to come. 
  Friends, a solid foundation for the people of all countries 
to strengthen unity and cooperation is working together for 
peace and development. Unity and cooperation need mutual 
understanding. In the past year, tens of thousands of guests 
from abroad have visited China. Many foreign guests I have met 
have told me that the China they had personally witnessed is 
entirely different from what they thought and originally 
understood it to be. An old Chinese proverb says, "It is better 
to see once than hear a hundred times." The year 1994 is the 
45th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of 
China. In the coming year, we earnestly welcome more foreign 
friends to come to China and see for themselves. Such contacts 
will promote mutual understanding, trust, and friendship. For 
decades the China International Broadcasting Station has been 
introducing China's developments to overseas audience, and it 
has been a bridge linking China with the outside world. I hope 
it will play a still greater role in enhancing friendship and 
cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of various 
countries of the world. 
  Finally, I once again wish you Happy New Year! Thank you.
