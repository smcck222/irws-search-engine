<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- To seriously implement 
the State Council's relevant decisions on further reforming the 
foreign exchange management system, the Bank of China recently 
held an urgent telephone conference of leading cadres at and 
above the department [chu 5710] level and called on all branch 
offices to adopt necessary and effective measures to ensure 
reform of the foreign exchange management system proceeded 
smoothly. 
  Wang Xuebing [3769 7185 0393], the new president of the Bank 
of China, said during the conference: The Bank of China has 
always been a specialized foreign exchange bank. Under the new 
system, it remains the state-designated foreign exchange bank. 
To do a serious and good job in reforming the foreign exchange 
management system is a glorious and yet arduous task assigned to 
the Bank of China by the state. Everyone in the bank must do 
the job well and with a great sense of social responsibility. 
  Wang Xuebing demanded: The leading cadres of all branch 
offices should attach a great importance to reform of the 
foreign exchange management system. Number one leaders should 
personally take a hand in organizing the implementation of 
reform measures. Attention should be given to ensuring that 
every level is performing its duties and regards the reform of 
the foreign exchange management system as the task of prime 
importance in 1994. At the same time, all branch offices should 
immediately organize serious operational training for relevant 
personnel in consideration of their actual business. 
  Wang Xuebing particularly emphasized: During the initial 
period of the new foreign exchange system, some supportive 
procedures and relevant rules and regulations will be either 
formulated or revised gradually. During this period, all branch 
offices at the different levels should pay special attention to 
strengthening internal management, preventing irregularities, 
and ensuring the safety of bank funds. In the meantime, since 
the new examination, approval and other business procedures 
still need further improvement step by step, it is even more 
necessary for all banking offices to pay attention to service 
attitude, quality and efficiency, and to strive to provide 
enthusiastic, accurate, and fast service, to be patient and 
meticulous in seeking the understanding and support of clients, 
and to ensure the new foreign exchange system proceeds smoothly. 
  Speakers at the telephone conference included Zhu Xiaohua, 
vice president of the Bank of China; and Wang Qiren, new 
chairman of the bank's board of directors.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Work Hard To Create More Brilliant Achievements </F>
-- New Year Message"] 
  [Text] The sailing ship of the times is riding the wind 
and cleaving the waves. The great motherland is ushering in 
1994, a year with plenty of struggles and plenty of hope. 
  With deep feelings, we are extending New Year 
congratulations 
to the people of all nationalities of the country; to our 
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao; and to compatriots 
living abroad. 
  In the year which has just gone by, the entire party and the 
people of all nationalities throughout the country -- continuing 
to firmly and resolutely implement the guidelines of the 
important talks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his south 
China tour and those set by the 14th CPC National Congress -- 
have seized the opportunities and deepened reform, thus making 
an important stride toward establishing a socialist market 
economic structure. Throughout the country there is a bumper 
harvest, industry grew, foreign trade was active, the market was 
brisk, and the people's living standards improved further. 
Taking a broad view of the great motherland, we saw the economy 
develop rapidly; social and political stability was achieved; 
unity and harmony among nationalities was achieved; and new 
progress was made in various fields of undertakings, all of 
which presented a scene of vitality and vigor. Initial results 
were achieved in the fight against corruption. The building of 
a spiritual civilization was constantly strengthened. Marked 
results were achieved in diplomatic work. Successful visits to 
foreign countries by Jiang Zemin and other party and state 
leaders enhanced China's friendship with the governments and 
peoples of various countries and created a more favorable 
international environment for China's modernization 
construction. These achievements have further enhanced the 
prestige of the party and the government, the prestige of our 
people's republic, and the prestige of socialism in China; they 
have strengthened the confidence of the people across the 
country in advancing victoriously along the road of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The year 1994 will be a crucial year for us to advance on 
the 
crest of victories to accelerate reforms and development. In 
the new year, we must implement in an all-round manner the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; while 
focusing on the central task of economic construction, we must 
advance the socialist market economy, socialist democratic 
politics, and the building of a socialist spiritual 
civilization. This year we should accelerate the pace of 
building a socialist market economic structure and open wider to 
the outside world. Party and government leaders at all levels 
must make meticulous arrangements for implementing the plans of 
the central authorities. In the process of reform, it is 
necessary to earnestly grasp two important matters. First, it 
is necessary to strengthen the position of agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy in order to ensure the steady 
growth of agriculture and the rural economy as a whole. Second, 
it is necessary to improve state-owned large and medium 
enterprises as well as increase their vitality in order to 
enable them to play the dominant and leading role in economic 
development. It is necessary to strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic control; vigorously adjust the economic structure; 
and heighten economic results in order to maintain the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. This year our tasks of reform and development are very 
arduous. We should allow reform to promote development and 
allow development to support reform. The increasingly stronger 
integration of these two principles is very important to the 
realization of our objectives by the end of this century. 
  In order to fulfill the tasks for 1994, we must first make 
greater efforts to arm all party members, particularly leading 
cadres at all levels, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Theory comes 
from practice, and it also guides practice. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the 
Chinese people to realize their grand ideal of invigorating the 
Chinese nation. In the new year, leading cadres at all levels 
must conscientiously study volume three of the "Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping" to have a more thorough understanding of basic 
points of view contained in the volume, particularly those on 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. They should 
vigorously promote the revolutionary spirit of exploring new 
paths and putting forward new ideas which was seen in the past 
decade or so; they should improve their leadership skills in 
carrying out reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
We must build a contingent of cadres capable of going deep into 
the realities of life, maintaining ties with the masses, putting 
the general interest above all else, and honestly performing 
their official duties so the vast ranks of party cadres will 
serve the people wholeheartedly and be good pacesetters in 
accelerating reform and development. 
  The interests of the people and their happiness are the 
starting point and foundation for all our work. Reform and 
construction are the cause for thousands upon millions of 
people. As long as we steadfastly rely on the vast number of 
workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres at various levels; 
mobilize all positive factors; and unite with all forces which 
can be united with, then there will be no difficulties which 
cannot be surmounted. In the new year we must carry forward in 
a better manner the fine tradition of maintaining close ties 
with the masses and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and 
utilizing their zeal for reform and construction. When new 
reform measures are introduced, we must do a good job in 
publicizing and explaining them. We must pay attention to 
methods of work and be good at analyzing and handling various 
kinds of contradictions arising within the people under the new 
circumstances. We must always care for the people, do 
everything within our power to protect their interests, and do 
more practical things for them so their living standards and 
initiative will keep rising. 
  Acceleration of reform and construction represents a grand 
and complex feat of social systems engineering. We must be good 
at grasping and applying Marxist materialist dialectics; we must 
correctly understand and handle various evolving relationships, 
especially those between reform, economic growth, and stability 
as well as between local and national interests. Reform and 
development furnish a solid foundation for social and political 
stability, while the latter in turn provide a major guarantee 
for the former. As reform and opening up increase the pace, we 
must firmly bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important idea 
that "stability is of overriding importance," persist in the 
policy of attaching equal importance to both the material and 
spiritual civilizations, and be careful not to emphasize one and 
neglect the other. While continuing to increase the 
establishment of a socialist democracy and legal system, as well 
as the socialist spiritual civilization, we must constantly 
consolidate and promote a political situation marked by 
stability and unity. As reform deepens by the day, it is even 
more important to take the overall situation into account and 
properly handle the relationship between local and national 
interests. In a large country like ours where conditions vary 
in a thousand ways from region to region, difficulties and 
contradictions are multitudinous. It is not easy to run such a 
country well, and we must depend on the entire nation and the 
entire party to work together with one heart. This is also one 
of our major advantages. In thinking over a problem or in 
undertaking work, leading comrades of all localities and 
departments must take the overall situation into account and 
conscientiously subject local interests to national ones. 
  The future of our motherland is splendid; the sons and 
daughters of the Chinese nation have heavy responsibilities on 
their shoulders. The new year beckons us to create more 
brilliant successes. The entire party and the entire nation 
must unite more closely under the leadership of the Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; must uphold 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; and must 
work hard with a pioneering spirit of the new period so as to 
achieve new progress and greater success.

<F P=106> ["Speech by PRC President Jiang Zemin at the New Year Tea </F>
Party of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, CPPCC, on 1 January in 
Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jan (XINHUA) -- Comrades, friends: 
  Today we have happily gathered here together to have a New 
Year tea party. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the 
State Council, and the Central Military Commission, I hereby 
extend my cordial regards and high respects to all of you, to 
all democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation, 
and to workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, commanders and 
fighters of the People's Liberation Army, armed police officers 
and men, and public security cadres and policemen of all 
nationalities across the country. I hereby also extend my 
sincere festival greetings and good wishes to Taiwan 
compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, our countrymen 
living abroad, and our international friends who have shown 
concern for and given support and assistance to China's 
modernization drive. 
  The year 1993 was a year in which, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we continued 
to win victories by grasping the opportunity to deepen reform 
and to develop the economy rapidly and in a healthy manner. It 
was also a year in which we made a major stride toward the goal 
set by the 14th CPC National Congress of building a socialist 
market economic system. China has maintained social and 
political stability, our economy has developed rapidly, people 
of all nationalities have worked in unison, and new progress has 
been made in our endeavors in all spheres. Last year, we 
continued to reap bumper agricultural harvests, our industrial 
production grew rapidly, the domestic market was brisk, our 
foreign trade was active, and our people's livelihood continued 
to improve. We won new diplomatic victories, and China's 
international influential power grew further. All these 
encourage us to usher in the new year with full confidence. 
  The year 1994 will be a very crucial year for our reform, 
opening up, and modernization. All party members and people of 
all nationalities across the country should more closely unite, 
work industriously, adhere to and carry out the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and, closely revolving around 
the central task of economic construction, go all-out to push 
forward our socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and 
socialist spiritual civilization. 
  In the new year, the nucleus of our efforts to deepen reform 
is to meticulously organize and implement a series of major 
reform measures designed to build a socialist market economic 
system. Due to the arduousness and comprehensiveness of the 
task, many new situations, problems, or even difficulties are 
bound to arise. Therefore, we must make thorough preparations 
beforehand, decide the best time to initiate each reform 
measure, carefully observe the progress we make, sum up 
experience in a timely manner, and ensure that our work is 
successful. We should continue to bring up new ideas of 
economic development, strengthen and improve macroregulation and 
control, and apply ourselves to restructuring the economy, to 
truly bring about a coexistence between speedy development and 
an improvement in economic efficiency. In carrying out the new 
year's economic work, we not only should make new major progress 
in economic reform, but we also should strive to make new 
progress in increasing our agricultural development potential, 
in increasing peasants' income, in transforming state-owned 
enterprises' operating mechanisms, in increasing these 
enterprises' vitality, in increasing the quality of enterprises' 
economic management, in assuring good order in our economic 
activities in all sectors, and in further broadening the scope 
of opening up to the outside world, so that we ensure that our 
economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner. 
  In the new year, one of our important tasks in developing 
socialist democratic politics is safeguarding and developing 
unity and political stability by relying on and uniting the 
people, so as to continue providing good social and political 
conditions for reforms and development. Leading comrades at all 
levels must bear in mind Comrade Xiaoping's important thinking 
that "stability is the overwhelming priority"; must correctly 
understand and handle the dialectical relationship between 
reform, development, and stability; and must correctly 
understand and handle the two types of social contradictions 
differing in nature. Leaders at all levels must crack down on 
crime according to the law; they should never be tenderhearted 
in dealing with crime. At the same time, they should earnestly 
study the new form of contradictions among the people and the 
trend of development of such contradictions and pay particular 
attention to new problems and new contradictions which may be 
created as a result of the need to further readjust the 
structure and relationship of interests in the course of 
deepening reform. Under no circumstances should they be 
negligent in this regard. From a long-range point of view, the 
development of the economy and the deepening of reform can 
further rationalize the various patterns and relationships of 
interests and lead to the objective of common prosperity for all 
people. However, in the course of reform it will be difficult 
to avoid certain degrees of gaps in benefits received by the 
people. Leading comrades at all levels must be good at 
analyzing and handling all types of contradictions among the 
people; they must do their ideological- political work and other 
corresponding work among the people meticulously and solidly to 
make them feel that the party and the government are reasonable 
and that they are sincere about safeguarding their interests and 
about caring about their hardships. Thus, the people will 
truthfully and sincerely support us and actively help us, or 
coordinate with us, in handling the various types of 
contradictions and problems. In this way, political stability 
and unity will continue to consolidate and develop. 
  In the new year, we must vigorously promote the building of 
a 
socialist spiritual civilization and strive for a breakthrough 
in achieving the progress of spiritual civilization in the 
entire society. This is urgently necessary if we are to 
accelerate reforms and development and bring about all-round 
progress in society. This also constitutes the urgent demand 
and common aspiration of the people of all nationalities across 
the country. In everything we do, we must do so according to 
the demands and aspirations of the people. Only thus can we 
gain their trust, and only thus can we gain the initiative and 
be successful in our work. At no time should we forget this 
historical truth. Our important strategic policy is to build a 
material civilization and a spiritual civilization 
simultaneously in the entire process of embarking on the 
socialist modernization drive. The more vigorously we develop 
the socialist market economy, the more truly we should 
strengthen the building of a spiritual civilization; develop 
education, science, and culture; arm the people with a correct 
ideology and ethics; and develop a noble, healthy atmosphere 
characteristic of our nation, a good social order, and a good 
social mood. This will provide us with a strong motivation and 
an important guarantee for building a material civilization, and 
ensure the all-round development of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  To ensure long-term political stability in China and to make 
it a prosperous and strong country, we must arm the whole party 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. We must adhere to the ideological line 
of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; strive to 
strengthen the party ideologically and organizationally; improve 
its style of work; and consolidate and strengthen the 
flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people. The call 
of the times and the expectations of the people demand that we 
strengthen the building of party organizations at all levels in 
the new period and that, in particular, we build a contingent of 
cadres who are capable of carrying on and developing the party's 
fine traditions, who are capable of going deep into reality to 
see how things really are, who advance in a pioneering spirit, 
who dare to assume responsibility, who take the interest of the 
whole into account, and who carry out their duties honestly. 
Cadres at all levels must bear in mind that they should 
establish contacts with the masses, carry out propaganda among 
the masses, organize the masses, and unite the masses to work 
for their own benefit -- this is our party's underlying strength 
and asset, as well as a way for to achieve victories in all 
areas of our work. We sincerely hope that everyone will give 
primary consideration in every respect to the interests of the 
party and the state, will make the masses their base, will 
discard all kinds of unhealthy practices of bureaucratism and 
formalism, will make progress in their leading skills and work 
methods, and will create a new style in wholeheartedly serving 
the people's interests. 
  The CPPCC has availed itself of the elite of prominent 
figures of all democratic parties, prominent figures without 
party affiliation, and prominent figures from all circles of the 
country. Over the past year, they earnestly carried out their 
responsibility to conduct political consultations and democratic 
supervision, in accomplishing a great deal of work and making 
many contributions. Adhering to the principles of "long-term 
coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all 
sincerity, and sharing weal and woe," the CPC will continue to 
strengthen its close cooperation with all democratic parties and 
patriots without party affiliation, to give better play to the 
system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation 
under the CPC's leadership. I hope that each of you will 
continue to offer your opinions and suggestions for the 
country's reform and development so that we can combine our 
efforts to serve the country and the people. 
  Realizing the great cause of the motherland's reunification 
is a sacred mission of all Chinese people, as well as an 
inevitable trend of the development of the Chinese nation. The 
Chinese Government and people across the country have the 
confidence, determination, and ability to promote the 
motherland's reunification according to the principle of 
"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." We 
resolutely oppose any forms of "two Chinas," "one China and one 
Taiwan," or "one country, two governments"; we resolutely oppose 
any discussions and actions aimed at promoting "Taiwan 
independence." We hope that the Taiwan authorities will put 
national righteousness above everything else and agree to 
establish direct contacts between the two sides of the strait as 
soon as possible under the principle of one China, in order to 
do some practical things to pave the way for the motherland's 
peaceful reunification. Recently, due to Britain's insistence 
on its erroneous position, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 
1994-95 election arrangements have broken down. As a matter of 
course, this has been denounced by all Chinese people, including 
our Hong Kong compatriots. Whatever problems may lie ahead, we 
will join all patriotic compatriots of all circles of Hong Kong 
in upholding the "one country, two systems" principle and the 
principle of the Hong Kong Basic Law; we will not change our 
determination to restore the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong and to preserve Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity. We believe that with the common efforts of the 
Chinese and Portuguese Governments, a steady transition of Macao 
and a smooth handover of its political power will be ensured. 
  In the world's current process of the development of 
multipolarization, China is an important force for preserving 
world peace and stability. China's development will not pose a 
threat to any country. We oppose all kinds of hegemony and 
power politics. In the new year, we, as always, will practice 
our independent foreign policy of peace, insist on developing 
friendly and cooperative relations with all countries on the 
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and 
continue to work actively to build a peaceful, stable, fair, and 
reasonable new international order. 
  Comrades and friends, the lofty cause that we have been 
toiling to achieve is to build China into a strong, democratic, 
civilized, and modern socialist country, following the path of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Whatever 
difficulties and disturbances we might encounter on the way of 
our expedition, our great cause shall not waver, and the pace of 
our advance must not slacken. Let us unite together more 
closely, firmly grasp the historic opportunity, and work hard 
for the Chinese nation's rejuvenation and the Chinese people's 
good future.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Gu Jinchi, secretary of the </F>
Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee, delivered at the provincial 
conference of propaganda directors on 1 December] 
  [Text] This provincial conference of propaganda directors 
has been very good. It made comprehensive arrangements for the 
province's 1994 propaganda and ideological work. After this 
conference, all comrades should arrange next year's propaganda 
and ideological work well in line with the guidelines of this 
conference and the specific conditions of all localities and 
departments. 
  The propaganda and ideological fronts have always been very 
important because a very important advantage of our party is its 
ability to mobilize and organize the masses through propaganda 
and press work. Without this work, our party will have no 
advantage, and neither will our political work. This was true 
in the revolutionary period and will still be true when the 
party's work focus is shifted to economic construction. At no 
times should we neglect the party's propaganda and press work. 
Propaganda and press work is needed in our efforts to arm the 
entire party and the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought, especially with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Propaganda and 
press work should also be in the lead in our endeavor to 
implement the party's line, principles, and policies. 
Conditions are continuously changing in the socialist 
undertakings we are developing, and we are always faced with the 
issue of how to correctly understand the changes. This also 
requires that we use propaganda and press work to guide the 
masses to correctly understand the objective things and unify 
their thinking. In short, we should have correct ideology as 
the guide and do a good job in propaganda and press work if we 
are to make all our work successful. Therefore, propaganda and 
press work and ideological and political work are very important 
at all times. It represents the party's trust and is very 
glorious for you, comrades, to engage in the work. Our province 
has done a very good and effective job in propaganda and 
ideological work. It has provided the entire country with many 
good experiences in deepening reform, opening wider to the 
outside world, and developing economic construction. This has 
been done through propaganda and ideological work and, 
therefore, embodies the painstaking efforts of our propaganda 
and ideological workers. On behalf of the provincial party 
committee, I will extend thanks to comrades on the propaganda 
and ideological fronts. 
  Now, I will speak on some views on how to make Liaoning's 
propaganda and ideological work even better. 
  First, to make propaganda and press work successful, a very 
important issue is the need to always adhere to the party's 
basic line to promote economic construction and other work. 
Currently, an important task for us is to comprehensively 
publicize and implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee. In particular, we 
should give priority to key areas according to Liaoning's 
reality. The ninth plenary session of the seventh provincial 
party committee approved the "opinions" on implementing the 
guidelines of the third plenary session. The "opinions" concern 
the general demand on Liaoning's implementation of the 
guidelines of the third plenary session, the guiding thoughts we 
should adhere to, and other work, especially the work closely 
related to the market economy, such as how to enter the market 
economy by deepening reform and opening wider to the outside 
world. Therefore, we should successfully implement the 
guidelines of the ninth plenary session of the seventh 
provincial party committee, with the focus on the "decision" of 
the third plenary session. 
  Second, to make propaganda and press work successful, we 
should have the ability to give priority to key aspects. What 
are Liaoning's key aspects? The ninth plenary session of the 
seventh provincial party committee held that priority should be 
given to the following three aspects: 1) The modern enterprise 
system should be popularized in state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises. The modern enterprise system 
represents the direction of the in-depth enterprise reform and 
the basic way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. Whether 
state-owned enterprises can be invigorated and enhance their 
strength as soon as possible is an issue determining whether the 
mainstay of the socialist market economy can be strengthened. 
When large and medium-sized enterprises lack strength, the 
mainstay of the market economy cannot take shape, and it will be 
difficult to establish the socialist market economy system. 
Therefore, we should have a sense of urgency and never take a 
wait and see attitude toward invigorating large and medium-sized 
enterprises. Comrade Xiaoping said that we should have the 
courage to experiment and blaze new trails for endeavors whose 
worth we are certain. Many years of reform and past experience 
show that the modern enterprise system should be popularized if 
state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises are to be 
invigorated. State-owned enterprises will have been truly pushed 
to the market when the modern enterprise system is popularized. 
Therefore, an issue we should study with great effort is how to 
implement to the letter the modern enterprise system in line 
with the reality of enterprises. Enterprises are currently 
faced with problems and difficulties in many areas. It should 
be easier to popularize the modern enterprise system in good and 
fairly good enterprises, and this will also provide very good 
experiences to difficult and fairly difficult enterprises. 2) 
We should deepen the rural reform and, on the premise that the 
responsibility system that has the household- based and 
output-related contract as the major form and the dual- 
management system that combines unified management with the 
persistent institution of independent management, actively 
develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency 
agriculture. We should properly facilitate intensive management 
and management of scale, greatly develop township enterprises, 
establish rural socialized service system more rapidly, and 
speed up construction of small cities and towns. Aiming at 
increasing peasants' income, we should accelerate the 
development of various rural undertakings so that rural 
commodities can all enter the market. Township enterprise 
development, in particular, plays a leading role in increasing 
the rural per capita income, shifting the rural surplus labor 
forces, promoting intensive management and management of scale, 
and effecting a change in the outlook of the entire rural area. 
Therefore, we should give priority to great development of 
township enterprises when carrying out rural work. 3) We should 
speed up establishment of the market system. Judging from the 
current conditions in establishing the market system, the 
markets for means of subsistence, consumer goods, and tangible 
materials have been built more rapidly, the markets for means of 
production, essential elements of production, and intangible 
materials have been built slowly, and futures markets have been 
built even more slowly. Therefore, we should give priority to 
the markets for the essential elements of production and speed 
up their construction. The provincial party committee holds 
that priority should be given to the above-mentioned three key 
aspects to promote other work. They represent not only the key 
aspects of economic work but also the key aspects of propaganda 
and ideological work. 
  Third, propaganda and press work must play a leading and 
encouraging role, and prevalence of erroneous public opinion on 
the propaganda front should be prevented. We should always use 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and the party's line, principles, and policies to guide the vast 
number of cadres and the masses and continuously boost their 
morale. In this way, we will be able to make the good situation 
still better, overcome unfavorable factors, and turn negative 
factors into positive ones. To achieve this, we should 
summarize and disseminate some good typical examples, methods, 
and experiences. This is very important. We may also criticize 
and expose problems, but they should be followed by results. 
This should still play an encouraging role because it is yet 
another method to mobilize cadres and the masses to overcome 
their deficiencies, solve existing problems, and promote work. 
These two aspects of work supplement each other, but guidance 
with positive examples should be the major method. Everybody 
has both strong points and weak points. Pointing out their weak 
points may not result in overcoming their weak points. We need 
to work on affirming and commending their strong points so that 
they can use their strong points to overcome their weak points 
and use their correct ideas to overcome incorrect ideas. Taking 
advantage of people's characteristic of having a strong sense of 
self-respect, which in itself is motivating, we should do a good 
job in giving guidance through positive examples. When the 
masses' enthusiasm is boosted, many difficulties will be 
conquered. This is also the case with improvement of leading 
bodies. It might not work if we only criticize a person's 
defects. After overall appraisal, if we affirm the major 
achievements of a cadre and then point out his defects, it will 
be easier for the cadre to admit his deficiencies and overcome 
them rapidly. Therefore, propaganda and press work should have 
the ability to lead and encourage the people and to guide them 
to carry forward fine traditions, good work styles, and good 
experiences. 
  Fourth, propaganda and press work should conform to the 
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
facts. This is an important guarantee to win the trust of the 
masses and achieve good results in propaganda. Adherence to the 
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
facts is an issue concerning work attitude, realistic spirit, 
and correct understanding of objective things. In doing 
propaganda and press work, we should make it conform to the 
reality of the period as much as possible, master the trend in 
the changes of things, and also guide things to advance in a 
correct direction. To achieve this, we should explore the 
necessary work procedure in addition to being conscientious and 
responsible in doing work. 
  In each period of great change when central authorities 
transmit important guidelines, we all face the issue of how to 
correctly understand and implement them. Under such 
circumstances, it is very important what public opinion will 
prevail in propaganda and press front. In publicizing central 
guidelines, we should not only follow them closely, but we 
should also refrain from overstepping the boundary, which will 
lead to problems. Therefore, in doing propaganda and press 
work, we should not only have sharp-witted ideas, the ability to 
discover new things, and the courage to publicize them, but we 
should also have a good command of principles, strictly abide by 
propaganda discipline, and avoid the misleading role of 
propaganda. It is often not easy for most people to accept new 
things and new experiences at the beginning. It is the 
propaganda and press units that should be the harbingers. How 
can new things and new experiences be accepted by most people if 
we do not vigorously create public opinion? If the propaganda 
and press front lacks sensitivity and still persists as though 
in a planned economy, we have no hope. Comrade Xiaoping's 
inclusion of emancipating the mind in our party's ideological 
line indeed represents significant developments in Marxism. It 
is metaphysics to view things as stagnant and static. 
Dialectical materialism views things in a continuous flux. To 
see the law governing the changes in the development of things, 
we should emancipate our minds and remain keen toward fresh 
things. Meanwhile, we also require that propaganda and press 
work be carried out in line with principles and in unity with 
the central authorities. We should never be vague on this. 
Maintaining unity with the central authorities is not 
contradictory to the effort in creation and development based on 
one's specific conditions and in being good at summarizing new 
experiences. 
  Fifth, to make propaganda and press work successful, we 
must often investigate and study life's realities. Our party 
has always emphasized the need to persist in the work style of 
going deep into the reality of life to conduct investigation and 
study and the need to respect the creative spirit of the masses. 
We should often go deep into the reality of life to conduct 
investigation and study if we are to make propaganda and press 
work vivid, lively, and capable of coping with problems. Only 
when we turn to the masses and the reality of life can we 
summarize good experiences and good ideas to replenish our minds 
and acquire a more comprehensive and complete understanding of 
all things. 
  Investigation and study should focus on our central work. 
In- depth investigations are currently needed on the following 
aspects: 1) what problems do all fronts encounter in in-depth 
reform, that hinder the development of productive forces and the 
promotion of work; 2) how does the unitary planned economy 
primarily influence and manifest itself in all layers, and what 
are the problems that need solution; 3) regarding the endeavor 
to open wider to the outside world, what fields need further 
opening, to whom should we open to, and what advantages do our 
development zones have; 4) concerning the product mix and 
industrial structure, what products and industries cannot be 
replaced by others, what products and industries are at the same 
level as other provinces, and how can we surpass this level 
through development, and 5) undertakings that have inherent 
relations. For example, how can some large enterprises that are 
in a slump and some township enterprises that urgently need 
development, coordinate the advantages of large enterprises in 
personnel, equipment, management, and funds with the needs of 
township enterprises, and have large and medium-sized 
enterprises learn from the mechanisms of township enterprises? 
We should conduct systematic investigations on the 
above-mentioned questions and study measures to resolve them. 
Conducting investigation and study is an issue concerning 
whether the propaganda and other fronts can implement the 
central guidelines to the letter in line with Liaoning's reality 
and whether they can effectively guide Liaoning's undertakings 
to advance. 
  In short, the propaganda and press front is very important 
in 
the new situation in which reform is deepened and opening up is 
expanded. The work of this front has a bearing on whether our 
party has strong leadership and can truly guide cadres and the 
masses to avoid detours and deviation in building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and whether the healthy trends in 
society can be developed and some ugly and unhealthy trends can 
be checked quickly. Therefore, it is hoped that party committees 
at all levels, especially their top leaders, will attach 
importance to the work of this front and make it successful. It 
is also hoped that all localities will conscientiously implement 
the guidelines of this conference of propaganda directors and 
truly take economic construction as the central task and 
development as an essential criterion.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- According to a report 
from the United States, an investigative report released by the 
U.S. Government publication the FEDERAL REGISTER [LIAN BANG JI 
SHI 5114 6721 6764 0057] has confirmed that the Beijing No. One 
Prison did not export, and is not likely to export in the 
future, socks produced by inmates working at its Qinghe Sock 
Factory. The facts of the case, concocted by Congressman Wolf, 
member of the U.S. House of Representatives, state that in 1991, 
"China's Beijing No. One Prison was exporting goods to the 
United States". This case has finally been vindicated by the 
facts. 
  On 27 March 1991, Representative Wolf and others visited the 
Beijing No. One Prison. When they toured the prison's sock 
workshop, Wolf attempted to take away without permission several 
pairs of semifinished socks on the table, but he was stopped 
then and there by the prison staff. After the tour, the warden 
gave each and every visitor five pair of socks as souvenirs. A 
few days later, however, Wolf, through the media outside China, 
without grounds, accused the Beijing prison of exporting socks 
it produced to the United States. Testifying to the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations after he returned to the United 
States, Wolf brazenly accused China, displaying the five pairs 
of socks given to him as gift, and claimed they were "proof" 
that China was exporting goods made by inmates in reformatories 
to the United States. Although China made an immediate 
clarification and explained the real situation on many 
occasions, Wolf still disregarded the basic facts and continued 
his totally groundless charges on many other occasions. Thus, 
the "case of the Beijing prison's sock exports" suddenly created 
a hue and cry in the U.S. Congress and in the media, creating a 
very bad impression of China. 
  Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy in China 
submitted a request to the relevant Chinese authorities to send 
some officials to visit the Beijing No. One Prison, and the 
authorities made arrangements for three officials of the U.S. 
Embassy in China to visit the prison on 30 March 1993. During 
the visit, the officials conducted a detailed investigation of 
the matter regarding Wolf's accusation that the prison was 
exporting inmate-produced socks to the United States. The 
officials then reported the results of their investigation to 
the U.S. Government. Later, Wolf again spread the lies he 
created and attacked China, without grounds, at another news 
conference held in the United States in the summer of 1993. The 
Chinese authorities time and again urged the United States to 
publicize the results of the investigation conducted by the 
embassy officials. On 13 December 1993, the U.S. Government 
publicized the results of the investigation in the FEDERAL 
REGISTER, and thus the factory was vindicated. 
  An official of the relevant Chinese authorities pointed out, 
with regard to products produced by reformatories, the policy of 
the Chinese Government is clear: Reformatory-operated 
businesses do not have the right to carry out economic and trade 
activities with foreign countries or to conduct import-export 
business. China has been strictly abiding by the "Memorandum of 
Understanding on Banning the Import and Export of 
Prison-Produced Products" ever since it was signed by China and 
the United States. Facts are the most convincing proof.

  [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. Government 
investigation has confirmed that the Qinghe stocking factory of 
Beijing's Number One Prison has never exported its products to 
the U.S. 
  The investigation report, which was published last month in 
the U.S. Government publication "FEDERAL REGISTER," has put an 
end to a two-year probe into rumors of exports of prison-made 
goods from China to the U.S. 
  On March 27, 1991, during his visit to the stocking workshop 
of the prison factory, U.S. Congressman Frank Wolf tried to take 
away several semi-finished products with the intention of 
keeping them, but he was stopped. 
  Later, before they left the prison, the warden gave each of 
the visitors including Frank Wolf five pairs of stockings as 
souvenirs. 
  But several days later Wolf claimed that stockings produced 
by the Beijing prison had been exported to the U.S. 
  After he returned home Wolf displayed the stockings at a 
hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate as 
"proof" that China had exported prison-made products. 
  Despite the fact that the Chinese side immediately clarified 
the truth of the matter, Wolf closed his eyes to the facts and 
continued to spread his allegations on many occasions. 
  Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy to China 
made a request to the Chinese department concerned for embassy 
officials to be allowed to visit the Beijing Number One Prison. 
  On March 30, 1993 the Chinese department concerned arranged 
a 
visit by three U.S. Embassy officials to the prison. During 
their visit the embassy officials said that they had made a 
detailed inquiry about Wolf's allegation and they would report 
their conclusion to the American government. 
  Later, in the summer of 1993, Wolf again spread his lies at 
a 
press conference held in the U.S. and accused China groundlessly. 
  After repeated requests by the Chinese department concerned, 
the U.S. Government published the investigation conclusion in 
"FEDERAL REGISTER" on December 13, 1993, which conforms to the 
facts. 
  Speaking about reform-through-labor products, a Chinese 
Government spokesman said that the policy of the Chinese 
Government is very clear. "Reform-through-labor enterprises 
have no right to conduct foreign trade," he said. 
  "Since China and U.S. reached an understanding about banning 
imports and exports of prison labor products, the Chinese side 
has always abided by the agreement. And facts are the best 
proof," the official added.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lian Gong (6647 0364): "Strengthening </F>
Understanding, Exchange and Cooperation Between the Two Cities 
Will Help Promote Development of Relations Between the Two 
Countries"] 
  [Text] Yesterday evening, Chen Xitong, member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, secretary of the 
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, and honorary chairman of the 
Beijing Municipal People's Association for Friendship with 
Foreign Countries, met with a Kiev city government delegation 
led by Leonid Kosakivskyy, representative of the president of 
the Ukraine stationed in Kiev city and state administrative 
leader of Kiev city. 
  During their enthusiastic talks, Chen Xitong welcomed the 
guests of Kiev city and congratulated Beijing Municipality for 
establishing friendly relations with Kiev city. 
  Chen Xitong happily reviewed the deep impression his visit 
to 
Ukraine in 1986 left. He acclaimed Kiev as a beautiful city 
full of patriotism. He said: Despite the changeable 
international situation, friendship between the peoples of China 
and the Ukraine will not change. As Beijing and Kiev, the 
capitals of the two countries, understand, exchange, and 
cooperate, they will surely help promote better relations 
between the two countries. 
  Chen Xitong said: The establishment of friendly relations 
between Beijing and Kiev will write a new page in the history of 
relations. He expressed the hope that both cities would regard 
this as a new starting point; realistically develop friendly 
cooperation in the economic, scientific, technological and 
cultural spheres; and unceasingly achieve substantial results. 
  Leonid Kosakivskyy thanked the Beijing Municipal leader for 
greeting him warmly and expressed Kiev city's ardent hope of 
strengthening exchange and developing cooperation with the 
Beijing Municipality.

  [Text] Harbin, January 4 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese city and a 
Russian city have agreed to build a cross-border free economic 
and trade zone. 
  The agreement, reached between Heihe city in the 
northeastern 
Chinese province of Heilongjiang and Blagoveshchensk city of the 
Amur region of Russia in the Far East, was made public here at a 
seminar named "special economic zones for regional development", 
jointly sponsored by the United Nations and Heilongjiang 
Province of China. 
  Under the agreement, the free economic and trade zone will 
extend from either end of the pontoon bridge to be built soon to 
span the boundary Heilongjiang river. 
  The zone, initially blueprinted to cover 20 sq km, will 
consist of 10 sq km of land from each of the two countries while 
respective state land ownership remains unchanged. 
  As outlined in the agreement, the zone, to be mainly engaged 
in trade, finance, high-tech industries, transportation and 
catering, is expected to become a transit center for goods and 
passengers. It is also designed to be an export-oriented 
processing base. 
  The agreement said the zone will be administered by a joint 
management commission, to be formed by state-appointed personnel 
from both China and Russia. The commission, meanwhile, will 
adopt internationally-recognized practices and regulations 
governing economic, social, cultural and legal affairs. 
  The zone will not be subject to the administration of either 
single government, the agreement noted. 
  Within the zone, both goods and currencies will be allowed 
to 
circulate and be exchanged freely, and citizens of both 
countries will be allowed to go in and out with a border pass 
issued by the management commission while citizens from other 
countries will be allowed in and issued visas upon arrival. 
  Participants in the seminar from the United Nations and 11 
countries, including Japan, Russia, China, Bulgaria, Thailand, 
the United States and the Republic of Korea, held that the 
framework for the free economic and trade zone is workable. 
  Heihe and Blagoveshchensk are the two largest and closest 
cities on the border between China and Russia. 
  Since 1987, border trade between the two countries has 
surged, with Heihe alone reporting a two-way trade volume of 
more than two billion Swiss francs up to the present. 
  To date, the two border cities have helped build connections 
between 2,000 companies in ten members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) and over 3,000 Chinese firms. 
  An official from the UN said the free economic and trade 
zone 
represents a brand-new type and can serve as an example for 
cross- border economic zones among other countries. 
  The zone, once established, is expected to be a development 
force for regional economies in Northeast Asia as well as a 
spark to lead development of the neighboring areas. 
  Currently the local governments of the two border cities are 
conducting detailed negotiations on the agreed project, which 
still awaits state approval by both China and Russia. 
  Last December China and Russia officially agreed to build a 
pontoon bridge across the Heilongjiang river separating the two 
countries.

  [Text] Moscow, January 4 (XINHUA) -- The Russian government 
headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin has moved to the former parliament 
building, known as the "White House," the ROSSISKAYA GAZETA 
newspaper reported today. 
  The paper quoted head of the government administration 
Vladimir Kvsov as saying that the first to move to the building 
were the Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and all of his deputies. 
  Chernomyrdin has taken over the office of former Parliament 
Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was arrested for organizing a 
violent confrontation with the government of President Boris 
Yeltsin in October last year. 
  Kvasov added that the office of former Vice President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, also arrested after the confrontation, was 
occupied by an ordinary government department. 
  The third floor of the "White House" is ready for Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and his staff, Kvasov said, explaining 
that this is necessary "for a closer contact of the president 
with the government." 
  However, the main office of the president and his 
administration remain in the Kremlin, Kvasov noted. 
  He said that the government staff will be reduced by 20 
percent. "today it can be definitely stated that those 
departments will be abolished which are outdated in the present 
economic conditions," he pointed out without elaborating. 
  The "White House" was initially built as the headquarters of 
the government of Russia when it was a Soviet republic. The 
building became the headquarters of Yeltsin during the "August 
19" event in 1991. 
  After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Russian 
government moved to the premises of the former central committee 
of the Soviet Communist Party in Staraya Square in Moscow, while 
the parliament remained in the "White House." 
  On October 4, 1993, Yeltsin ordered tanks to pound the 
"White 
House" to suppress the headquarters of the armed opposition 
headed by Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. 
  Soon after the event Yeltsin ordered the government to move 
to the building and provided two other buildings for the new 
legislature elected on December 12. 
  For the time being the newly-elected parliament is to work 
in 
the former COMECON (or the Council of Mutual Economic 
Assistance) buiding and in the house of the Russian press. 
  However, a special building will be constructed for the new 
legislature, Kvasov said.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province has formed a scientific service network to help farmers 
to compete on the market. 
  The province has registered 6,200 agro-technical societies 
with 240,000 members since farmers voluntarily set up the first 
one in 1980. 
  These societies are involved in more than 100 specialties 
covering plantation, breeding, gardening, sideline processing 
and rural enterprises. 
  Of the societies, about 1,000 focus on the study of 
technology, economic development and new products for rural 
industries. 
  Founded in 1985, the Nanfeng township-run Station Wagon Body 
Society in Zhangjiagang city, Jiangsu Province, has imported 12 
items of advanced technology and developed 18 new products. 
  As a result, it generated more than 80 million yuan in taxes 
and profits last year. 
  The province has formed a number of large special production 
bases and markets with the help of rural societies. 
  The Changzhang Vegetable Society in Tongshan county has set 
up a vegetable consultancy department, a seedling department and 
a production and marketing department to offer a package of 
related services. Its vegetables sell well across the country. 
  According to the provincial society of sciences and 
technology, Jiangsu will set up a provincial level federation of 
rural professional technology to better guide farmers to 
contribute in the market economy.

  [Text] Jinan, January 2 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong 
Province plans to earmark 10 billion yuan this year to fund some 
40 major projects in a bid to improve its infrastructure. 
  The projects will cover farming, water conservancy, energy, 
transport, communications and raw materials, according to 
provincial authorities. 
  To guarantee success, Shandong will introduce new measures 
including tendering, ways of investment and a responsibility 
system. 
  Last year, the province invested seven billion yuan in 36 
key 
projects, 16 of which have already been completed. 
  The newly-constructed Jinan-Qingdao highway, which links the 
province's inland capital to the scenic coastal city widely 
known for its beer, was the top project. The highway, of which 
the construction involved investments totalling 3.1 billion 
yuan, is expected to spark an economic take-off for the areas 
along the expressway. 
  Local experts estimate that the highway will bring about 
additional profits of more than five billion yuan every year.

  [Text] To solve the shortage of the funds for building key 
projects, this year the province will set up new money-lending 
and investment forms and will primarily spend the investment of 
a policy nature on building key projects. In 1994, the number 
of key projects in the province is preliminary fixed at 40 or 
more and the amount of planned investment is fixed at 10 billion 
yuan, an increase of 40 percent over that in 1993. In addition 
to the 20-odd projects, including the continued projects of the 
Shandong section of Beijing-Jiulong Railway, Yantai Port, Rizhao 
Port, and Dezhou, Weifang, Weihai, and Zouxian Power Plants, the 
expansion of Laizhou Iron and Steel Plant, and the projects of 
harnessing Huai He and Hai He, the province will also choose 
through screening some key projects from newly started large 
projects, such as the Shandong section of Jinan-Handan Railway, 
Jinan-Liaocheng Highway, Jinan- Dezhou Highway, Qingdao and 
Longkou Power Plants, Taian Chemical Industrial General Plant, 
Yantai Electronics [words indistinct] Plant, and [words 
indistinct]. 
  To ensure that the funds needed by the above projects will 
be 
put in place in full amount and in a timely manner, the province 
will reform investment and money-lending systems. After the 
reform, construction projects will be divided into three major 
categories, namely, basic projects, technological projects, and 
competitive projects. Most of key projects belong to the scale 
of using the investment of a policy nature. The government will 
provide necessary manpower and material resources to make 
investment in these projects through economic entities and 
extensively absorb direct investment from foreign firms. 
Through [words indistinct] banks, the province will give 
preferential treatment and support to these projects in the 
fields of providing loans and issuing bonds. After the reform, 
the province will make a clear distinction between the 
investment rights of the provincial authorities and the 
governments in various cities, prefectures, and counties. 
Beginning from this year, the provincial authorities will 
primarily assume responsibility for the projects that have a 
bearing on the overall situation of the provincial economic 
development and the key projects that span several regions and 
spheres. The source of funds is primarily arranged by the state 
and the province, and a certain proportion of investment will be 
absorbed from various cities, prefectures, and counties. The 
funds arranged by cities and prefectures must be put in place on 
time. Otherwise, the province will arrange for new projects. 
The investment in basic projects of prefectures, cities, and 
counties should be arranged by the localities where the projects 
are located in line with the principle that whoever makes 
investment should be benefited. As for the less developed 
localities, in addition to gaining the state investment of a 
policy nature, the province will give an appropriate amount of 
subsidies. From now on, the government should gradually 
increase the investment in the competitive projects.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 4 (XINHUA) -- China's largest 
metropolis reported a record amount of foreign investment used 
in 1993. 
  The municipal government approved 3,650 foreign-funded 
projects involving contractual investment totalling 7.016 
billion U.S. dollars last year, increases of 82 and 110 percent 
respectively over the previous year. 
  A municipal government official in charge of foreign 
investment said that of the 120 transnational corporations set 
up in the city, 60 percent began to make profits last year. 
  The city approved 205 large projects each with an investment 
exceeding 10 million U.S. dollars last year. These projects 
account for a total investment of 4.24 billion U.S. dollars, 60 
percent of the total. 
  The official noted that 1,037 of the approved projects are 
involved in banking, trading, commerce, real estate and 
improving urban infrastructural facilities. 
  By the end of last year, more than 3,000 industrial projects 
had gone into production, becoming a new force in Shanghai's 
economic development. 
  Experts here attributed the soaring investment in Shanghai 
to 
the large-scale development of the Pudong area, a 
newly-established economic zone, and the daily improvement of 
investment conditions. 
  So far, the city has approved 6,939 foreign-funded projects 
with contractual investment totalling 13.705 billion U.S. 
dollars.

  [Text] On behalf of the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC 
Committee, [provincial party committee secretary] Guan Guangfu 
made a work report at the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress. 
  In his report, Comrade Guan Guangfu first reviewed the 
province's work over the past five years since the conclusion of 
the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress. He stated: Over the 
past five years, the broad masses of cadres and people across 
the province have comprehensively implemented the party's basic 
line, acquired an in-depth understanding of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, further emancipated the mind, made constant 
efforts to explore in light of actual provincial conditions new 
ways and means of deepening reform, expediting growth, and 
fulfilling such a strategic goal as making Hubei rise in central 
China, persistently deepened various reforms, further expanded 
opening up to the outside world, gradually quickened the pace of 
economic construction, and correspondingly improved people's 
livelihood. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu said: Over the past five years, party 
committees at all levels across the province have continually 
grasped two work aspects at the same time by taking account of 
the overall provincial situation as well as united and guided 
the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people in 
unremittingly forging ahead and constantly opening up new 
vistas. In the last five years, Hubei's average annual 
industrial output value and agricultural output value have 
maintained a 10.2 percent increase and a 4.7 percent increase 
respectively. As a result, we have basically attained each and 
every goal laid down by the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress 
and laid a solid foundation for speedier economic development in 
the future. 
  It should be especially noted that since Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping gave a series of important talks during his south China 
tour and since the 14th CPC National Congress, Hubei has 
witnessed an unprecedentedly gratifying situation in reform and 
development. In 1992 Hubei's total gross national product 
recorded a 12.1 percent increase. That year also saw an 
accelerating economic growth across the province with per unit 
area yield of grain, cotton, and oil crops each hitting an 
all-time high and the province's total cotton output setting a 
new record. In 1992, Hubei's industrial production also 
registered faster growth coupled with increased economic 
efficiency. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu went on: It is estimated that by the 
end of 1993, Hubei's gross national product, total agricultural 
output value, and total industrial output value will have 
registered a 12.5 percent increase, a 5.5 percent increase, and 
a 17 percent increase respectively. Hubei is also expected to 
have raised economic efficiency by a large margin, raised 
financial revenue by 10.25 percent, accelerated key projects 
construction, increased fixed assets investment by 5.4 percent, 
and opened up new vistas for a fledgling export-oriented 
economy. Hubei will have raised export trade volume by 16 
percent, made use of a total of $630 million of foreign funds, 
approved a new batch of over 2,200 foreign-funded enterprises, 
pushed ahead with township and town enterprises development at 
an extraordinary pace, and considerably raised the proportion of 
secondary and tertiary industries in comparison with the 
proportion of primary industry in the vast rural areas, thereby 
bringing about a historical takeoff. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu maintained: I'm convinced that Hubei 
will have attained each and every goal laid down by the Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee at the start of 1993, including: To 
raise gross national product to over 100 billion yuan, to raise 
total industrial and agricultural output value to over 200 
billion yuan, to raise financial revenue to over 10 billion 
yuan, and to increase income of urban and rural residents by a 
large margin. I'm also convinced that Hubei will have 
accelerated scientific, educational, cultural, public health, 
and other social undertaking developments by the end of this 
year, thereby pushing ahead with both spiritual civilization and 
material civilization building. 
  Guan Guangfu concluded: By conscientiously and meticulously 
handling various social contradictions, we have successfully 
maintained political and social stability here in Hubei and 
continually stepped up party building amid the tide of reform 
and construction.

  [Text] After fully fulfilling its agenda, the five-day 
Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress, which began on 24 December, 
came to a successful close in Wuchang's Hongshan Auditorium at 
noon on 28 December. 
  The congress pledged that in the nineties, party 
organizations at all levels in Hubei will continue to be 
entrusted with a glorious historic mission and face rigorous 
challenges. The key to opening up new vistas for Hubei's work 
lies in enhanced party building and improved party leadership. 
  The congress called on party organizations at all levels as 
well as the broad masses of Communist Party members across the 
province to conscientiously implement to the letter the spirit 
of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; further 
emancipate the mind; open up new vistas; vigorously forge ahead; 
firmly seize the current historic opportunity; press ahead with 
reform and opening up; strive to build a socialist market 
economic structure; push Hubei's economic and social development 
onto a new stage; and attain the grand goal of realizing a 
comparatively well-off living standard in Hubei by the turn of 
the century under the leadership of both the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and the newly 
elected Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee and under the 
guidance of both Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu, [provincial CPC committee secretary], 
presided over the congress's closing ceremony. 
  Sitting in the front row on the rostrum at the closing 
ceremony were congress presidium standing committee members

Liangyu; Qian Yunlu; Zhong Shuqiao; Ding Fengying; Zheng Yunfei; 
Li Daqiang; Wang Zhongnong; [provincial military district 
commander] Liu Guoyu; Liu Rongli; and Chen Ming. 
  Wang Xudong, CPC Central Committee Organization Department 
deputy director, was also seated in the front row on the rostrum. 
  Also sitting on the rostrum were five special guests, 
comprising veteran comrades Han Ningfu, Liu Huinong, Li Erzhong,

branches of various democratic parties; and a number of 
well-known personages without party affiliation, including Shen 
Kechang, Lin Jinmin, Zhou Zibai, Dai Jianneng, Ping Linbo, Wang 
Zizuo, Han Nanpeng, and others. 
  The closing session first announced the results of several 
elections held in the morning. 
  Under the supervision of a general scrutineer and several 
scrutineers, a total of 763 congress delegates and the five 
aforementioned special guests elected by secret ballot from 
among an equal number of candidates a total of 52 members and 11

and a total of 35 members of the Hubei Provincial CPC Discipline 
Inspection Commission.

Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee Work Report; 
  The Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress Resolution on the 
Hubei Provincial CPC Advisory Committee Work Report; 
  The Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress Resolution on the 
Hubei Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission Work 
Report.

by Comrade Guan Guangfu on behalf of the Fifth Hubei Provincial 
CPC Committee; concurred with Comrade Guan Guangfu's summation 
of the provincial party committee work over the past five years 
and his analysis of the current provincial situation; and held 
that all strategic goals and tasks put forth by Comrade Guan 
Guangfu in his Work Report are feasible and realistic and tally 
with reality in Hubei. 
  The closing session called on party organizations at all 
levels in Hubei to enhance the sense of responsibility and the 
sense of urgency still further in the course of grasping 
opportunities and speeding up development and to comprehensively 
fulfill all tasks laid down in Comrade Guan Guangfu's Work 
Report. 
  The closing session decided not to form a new Hubei 
Provincial CPC Advisory Committee. For this reason, it extended 
heartfelt thanks and paid lofty tribute to all former Hubei 
Provincial CPC Advisory Committee members as well as all veteran 
comrades in Hubei. 
  The closing session fully affirmed work accomplished by the 
Hubei Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission over the 
past five years.

Guan Guangfu delivered a speech in which he pointed out: Thanks 
to concerted efforts by the congress delegates, the current 
congress has finally come to a successful close! This has been 
a fruitful congress which has enhanced solidarity and boosted

impact on Hubei's reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization drive and encourage the Hubei people to strive for 
new and greater victories with a completely new mental attitude!

Committee has pledged to exert its utmost to live up to the

people in Hubei. To this end, we should make redoubled efforts

  [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- The coastal areas of 
the Bohai Sea in northern China are becoming more and more 
attractive to overseas investors, especially those from the 
Republic of Korea and Japan, as the local economy booms. 
  Rough statistics show that the region has by now drawn 
six-tenths of China's total investment from the Republic of 
Korea and one-third of its Japanese investment. 
  The region, with a population of 196 million, includes 
Liaoning, Shandong and Hebei Provinces, and Tianjin and Beijing 
cities, covering an area of 491,000 square kilometers. 
  Investors from South Korea and Japan are now showing an 
increasing interset in the region thanks to its favorable 
geographic position and abundant natural resources. 
  Investors from the Republic of Korea have invested in 1,550 
enterprises in Liaoning, Shandong and Tianjin with a total of 
1.1 billion yuan, covering electronics, medicine, textiles and 
garments and mechanical manufacturing. 
  They have shown special interest in coastal cities in the 
Shandong peninsula. In Yantai city, 59 Korean-funded 
enterprises were approved in 1992. But in the first seven 
months of last year, the city approved 41 companies funded by 
the Republic of Korea. 
  Tianjin, the third largest city in China, has drawn as much 
as one-third of the country's investment from Korea. 
  Korean investors are still increasing their investment in 
the 
region. With an investment of 30 million U.S. dollars for its 
first-phase construction, the Korean industrial zone in Tianjin, 
covering an area of 1.8 square kilometers, expects to draw 200 
to 400 million U.S. dollars from more than 100 enterprises. 
  Many major Korean enterprises have come to the region, with 
their investment lasting as long as 30 years. 
  Japanese investors are also interested in the region. With a 
total of 1.37 billion yuan, they now have a sales value of 1.2 
billion yuan from their enterprises whose exports have reached 
100 million U.S. dollars. 
  The Japanese investors show their special preference for 
Talian, a port city in Liaoning Province. Their investment 
makes up one- third of the total overseas investment in the area. 
  The Japanese are now setting up an industrial zone in the 
port city, expanding their investment and drawing more and more 
major enterprises to the area. 
  The economic and technological cooperation between China and 
the Republic of Korea and Japan in the region is steadily 
increasing. 
  To meet the demand of the increasing trade, the coastal 
cities along the Bohai Sea have opened air and sea routes to the 
main cities of Japan and the Republic of Korea.

  [Text] County party committee secretaries in Sichuan wound 
up the latest round of collective study in Chengdu yesterday. 
Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie yesterday 
attended and relayed the spirit of the sixth provincial party 
committee second plenary session at the study class at which 
provincial party committee Deputy Secretary Qin Yuqin also made 
a speech. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie pointed out in his speech: The sixth 
provincial party committee second plenary session, which 
concluded on 21 December, had implemented to the letter the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the spirit of a recently concluded national 
economic work conference. The important plenary session had also 
made specific arrangements for Sichuan's work in 1994. 
  After briefly reviewing Sichuan's work in 1993, Secretary 
Xie 
Shijie spelled out the following tasks and requirements for 1994: 
  1. To strive to acquire a correct understanding of the 
current situation, enhance a sense of opportunity, press ahead 
with all- round development, and intensify a sense of historical 
responsibility. 
  2. To closely integrate reform, opening up, and 
construction, adopt an overall point of view, concentrate on key 
aspects of work, and quicken the pace of economic development. 
  3. To keep close watch over new developments and new 
problems, continually and firmly grasp two key aspects of work 
at the same time, safeguard social stability, and push ahead 
with social progress and development. 
  Comrade Qin Yuqin stated in his speech: During 15 days of 
theory study, county party committee secretaries from across 
Sichuan have conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, all documents issued 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
and the spirit of the recently concluded national economic work 
conference. They also listened to a number of work reports and 
scored relatively gratifying results in theory study. Thanks to 
these study activities, all county party committee secretaries 
have now acquired an in-depth understanding of the ideological 
line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, 
which constitutes the essence of Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, as well as the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which constitutes the 
main theme of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. They have also further emancipated their minds, 
successfully removed a variety of ideological obstacles 
hampering Sichuan's development, deepened their understanding of 
such a question as why a socialist market economic structure 
should be built, enhanced comprehension of the basic principle 
underpinning socialism with Chinese characteristics which is 
continually and firmly grasping two key work aspects at the same 
time. 
  Comrade Qin Yuqin also called for continually and profoundly 
studying and conscientiously implementing all strategic tasks 
laid down at the 14th CPC National Congress, further updating 
ideological concepts, and cultivating a fine style among broad 
masses of party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at 
and above the county level, in order that all comrades will 
attach importance to theory study and respect science.

  [Excerpts] Although it was snowing this morning, the 
conference room on the third floor of the provincial party 
committee office was as warm as spring. In a relaxed and happy 
atmosphere, provincial leaders, including He Zhukang, Gao Yan, 
Wang Jinshan, Zhang Yueqi and Su Rong, and responsible persons 
of some institutions of higher learning in Changchun gathered 
here to attend a forum. When the forum began, Comrade He 
Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, first 
fully affirmed the 1993 work achievements of all institutions of 
higher learning and extended festive greetings to the broad 
masses of teaching and administrative staff on the educational 
front on behalf of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government. [passage omitted] 
  At the forum, the participants spoke without any 
inhibitions, 
freely aired their views and felt that under the correct 
leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, Jilin Province has witnessed a year of great success 
in 1993, industrial production has been steadily developed, all 
sorts of reforms have been unceasingly deepened, the society has 
been stable and economic work has entered a new stage. Economic 
development is an encouragement to the whole educational front. 
What is touching to all is that the provincial party committee 
and the provincial government have showed respects to knowledge 
and trained personnel, issued special allowances to members of 
scientific council and class masters of students studying for a 
doctorate, and unceasingly enhanced the wages of the broad 
masses of intellectuals, thus greatly encouraging the 
intellectuals. The teaching and administrative staff of 
institutions of higher learning across the province have based 
on their own work, studied intensively, scored gratifying 
achievements in scientific research work, unceasingly deepened 
teaching reform, greatly raised the teaching quality, given 
full play to the trained personnel and advantages of 
institutions of higher learning and made contributions to Jilin 
Province's economic construction. 
  At the forum, the participants respectively introduced their 
progress in vying to join the 211 project in line with reality 
and their situation in training personnel, building ranks of 
teachers, conducting teaching reform, developing school-run 
industries as well as their ideological and political work. 
They also offered many suggestions on how to train personnel 
that are badly need in Jilin Province, how to use the scientific 
and technological advantages of institutions of higher learning 
and their scientific research achievements to serve Jilin's 
economic construction and talked about their personal views and 
suggestions on the existing problems in the current educational 
development. 
  On hearing that at present all institutions of higher 
learning have a stable rank of teachers and good working 
enthusiasm and that some outstanding personnel have come to work 
in the northern province from the south, the provincial leaders 
were very happy. They expressed one after another that they did 
not fear of too many personnel and that they would like more 
outstanding personnel to come and work in our province. 
  In referring to the importance of training personnel and how 
to give better play to the role of young and middle-aged 
outstanding personnel, the provincial leaders believed that this 
issue is very important because it affects not only the 
educational front but also involves the scientific research, 
public health and cultural spheres. In the future, overall 
consideration should be given to the personnel policy and 
efforts should be made to unceasingly improve it. It is 
necessary to formulate special preferential policies to mobilize 
the enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals. At the 
same time, it is hoped that all participants would use their 
mind more frequently and offer more ideas to jointly study and 
solve this issue. 
  In referring to the issue of enrolling self-paying students, 
the provincial leaders pointed out: In expanding the enrollment 
of self-paying students, we must guarantee their quality, and 
must not lower the educational quality in order to increase the 
enrollment of self-paying students. 
  After listening to their briefings, Comrade He Zhukang said: 
All of you have given very good views which will be beneficial 
to the provincial party committee to further understand the work 
of all institutions of higher learning. This year the situation 
of the entire educational front has been good. Institutions of 
higher learning across the province have achieved noticeable 
results in deepening reform and raising quality, playing a 
positive role in promoting Jilin's economic development. At 
present, the international and domestic situations are favorable 
for our development and the favorable conditions are many. We 
must seize the opportunity and accelerate the pace of reform and 
development of the institutions of higher learning. However, we 
should also recognize the problems and difficulties in the 
course of development, give emphasis to stability, unceasingly 
improve and strengthen the ideological and political work of 
institutions of higher learning. In short, it is hoped that all 
of you will pay more attention to analyzing the existing 
problems, do more profitable work and enable institutions of 
higher learning across the province and educational work to 
develop towards a higher level. It is hoped that in the days to 
come, all of you will maintain ties and exchange views regularly 
and exert joint efforts to successfully carry out all fields of 
work in the province.

<F P=106> [By Trainee Ma Qiang (7456 1730) and Reporter Guo Yingyan </F>
(6753 3467 3601): "Liaoning Provincial Government Holds Forum on 
Overall Agricultural Development"] 
  [Text] From 1 to 3 December, the provincial government 
held a forum on overall agricultural development in Fuxin city. 
  The participants maintained: Since the implementation of the 
overall agricultural development project and the principle for 
comprehensively improving mountainous areas, water courses, 
forestry, farmland, and roads and comprehensively developing 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, 
and fishery, the province has noticeably improved agricultural 
production conditions and the ecological environment, promoted 
the popularization and application of new varieties and new 
technologies, and upgraded overall agricultural production 
capability. In the past five years, 1.879 million mu of medium- 
and low-yield land, covered in the state-listed development 
projects, were transformed; 568,000 mu of wasteland suitable to 
agricultural production were reclaimed; 30,000 mu of grassland 
were improved; and 207,000 mu of shelter belts were built. 
Three million mu of key farmland was built in the western part 
of the province and Chaoyang area. Some medium- and low-yield 
land of the mountain areas in the eastern part of the province 
were transformed with the focus on improving the soil's acidity 
and transforming frozen land. All localities across the 
province rapidly developed the production of wheat and 
vegetables, fruit trees, the cattle breeding industry, coastal 
areas, and beaches. 
  The participants maintained: Although the province has made 
great achievements in overall agricultural development, some 
problems still persist that cannot be ignored. 
  Xiao Zuofu set forth six opinions on overall agricultural 
development to which we should pay attention. First, we should 
persist in the principle of never ignoring grain production and 
positively developing a diversified economy. We should focus 
the overall agricultural development on grain production, ensure 
a stable improvement in overall grain production, strengthen the 
construction of agricultural infrastructural facilities, 
ceaselessly improve agricultural production conditions and 
agricultural service means, and vigorously develop high-yield, 
good-quality, and high- efficiency agriculture. Second, we 
should develop areas on a large scale and stress efficiency of 
scale. We should persistently make unified plans and 
arrangements and make reasonable distribution to set up 
agricultural production bases and comprehensively develop 
agriculture in line with the orientation of regional economy, 
commercialization, intensive economy, and modernization; and 
build the overall agricultural development areas into ones 
experimenting with the development of high-yield, good-quality, 
and high- efficiency agriculture; modernized agricultural model 
areas; and areas advanced towards the target of becoming fairly 
well-off. Third, we should organize overall agricultural 
development in line with the requirements of industrialization 
and coordinate small- scale production with large markets. We 
should comprehensively develop agriculture in line with the 
ideology that the government cultivates markets, markets guide 
production, production meets the demands of markets, support and 
protection policies, and according to the requirements of 
industrialization; organize each and every household to engage 
in decentralized management; develop key industries and key 
products in line with regional distribution, specialized 
production, coordinate management, socialized service, and 
enterprise management; and carry out the cropping-breeding- 
processing, production-supply-marketing, domestic-and-foreign 
trade, and agricultural-industrial-commercial production and 
management system where markets play a leading role, production 
bases are set up according to market demands, and production 
bases establish contacts with peasant households. Fourth, we 
should pay attention to scientific and technological input and 
persist in high starting points, high standards, high quality, 
and high efficiency in overall agricultural development. We 
should try every possible means to try out increasingly more new 
agrotechnological findings and improved varieties; strengthen 
technological training; improve the peasants' quality and 
scientific and technological level; set up areas experimenting 
with the development of high-yield, good-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture; increase the input of new high-tech 
and improved varieties; and increase the scientific and 
technological contents of agriculture. Fifth, we should 
arrange, in a unified manner, various funds in line with overall 
agricultural development. We should collect funds from all 
fronts and increase the input to agriculture. We should define 
projects according to their efficiency and determine the amount 
of capital in line with projects. Instead of making equal 
distribution or dividing the proportion of investment according 
to conventions, we should select and increase input to areas 
with high enthusiasm and the guarantee for timely supply and 
allocation of capital. In regard to the capital input 
orientation, we should grasp the construction of both 
infrastructural facilities and key projects so as to make full 
use of the limited capital. Sixth, we should gradually conduct 
development in management. So far, some localities have made 
appropriate achievements by organizing and setting up entities 
and increasing machines. All localities should positively make 
explorations, accumulate experiences, and embark on a sound 
orbit of overall agricultural development. 
  Xiao Zuofu stressed: 1994 is the last year to implement the 
project to comprehensively develop agriculture on the Liao He 
plain as well as the first year to work out the next overall 
agricultural development project and the project for developing 
Songliao Plain with World Bank loans. Therefore, it is of great 
importance to achieve this winter and next spring's work. All 
localities and all departments concerned should firmly grasp the 
formulation of the overall agricultural development plan. All 
localities should comprehensively fulfill the tasks for 
comprehensively developing Liao He plain and attain the desired 
results by 1 May 1994. 
  Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, made an important speech at the forum. He 
particularly stressed the necessity to accurately handle the 
relationship between industry and agriculture and the 
relationship between large and medium-sized enterprises and town 
and township enterprises. In regard to the further development 
of the rural economy and the overall development of agriculture, 
he pointed out that in line with the reality of the province, we 
should work out ways to develop agriculture and elevating 
agriculture to a new height. A ratio of fifty-fifty exists 
between urban and rural populations of the province. Our 
province has more large and medium-sized cities and large 
industrial enterprises. All this has helped provide a vast 
market for developing agriculture. We should focus the 
development of the rural economy on grain production, take the 
construction of farm and sideline products bases as a starting 
point, and gain the advantages of large-scale management. Our 
province has great potential in this regard. Now that 
foodstuffs and vegetables from the southern areas have entered 
the markets of the north, it is time to set up large markets in 
northeast China. Only when there is an ample supply of 
materials will markets become more brisk. 
  In regard to the overall agricultural development, he 
stressed that we should achieve the construction of farmland 
water conservancy projects; pay attention to the development of 
sea and road transportation and the construction of small towns; 
and develop roads linking counties with townships and linking 
townships with villages. With convenient transportation 
conditions, we are able to promote commodity circulation. We 
should work out plans to build small towns. Only when small 
towns are well established and the town and township enterprises 
relatively concentrated will we be able to achieve big 
development. In short, Liaoning has great potential for 
agricultural development. Leaders at various levels should pay 
attention to agriculture and rural work. So long as we do solid 
work we will be able to turn expectations into reality. 
  Present at the forum were vice mayors in charge of 
agricultural work and responsible comrades of the 
provincial-level departments concerned.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- A Mainland Chinese hijacker 
was sentenced to nine years in jail by the Taoyuan District 
Court for violating Taiwan's civilian aviation law. 
  Zhang Wenlung, 28, of Jiansu Province in eastern China, used 
a pocket knife and toy gun to force a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 
jet with 72 people aboard to fly to Taiwan on June 24. 
  Zhang, a former soldier in the mainland army, was given a 
nine- year jail term instead of 12 years as recommended by the 
prosecutors because he surrendered himself to police upon 
landing. 
  Ten mainland aircraft have been commandeered to Taiwan since 
last [words indistinct]. 
  The repatriation of hijackers has become the most pressing 
issue for authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
During the cross-strait technical talks held in Taipei in 
December, negotiators failed to work out any solution to the 
problem because they were unable to bypass the sovereignty and 
jurisdiction issues involved. 
  Meanwhile, another three hijackers, Zhang Hai, who forced a 
Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 to fly to Taiwan on Nov. 5, and Li 
Zianyu and Han Shuxue, who together commandeered a China 
Northern Airlines MD82 passenger plane to Taiwan on Nov. 12, 
were indicted by prosecutors Tuesday [4 January] for violating 
the aviation law.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- The Board of Foreign Trade 
[BOFT] is studying the feasibility of direct marine links 
between Taiwan and Mainland China. 
  Despite the government ban on such links, many marine 
companies sail direct to the mainland coast. The Ministry of 
Economic Affairs will use the BOFT report in deciding whether to 
recommend that the ban on marine links be lifted. 
  BOFT Director-General Huang Yen-chao said that ships sailing 
to mainland ports are flying foreign flags which makes them 
difficult to police. He said direct marine links should be 
considered as long as they don't involve mutual recognition 
problems.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Plans for what will be 
Taiwan's largest industrial park have been finalized, Vice 
Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien reported Tuesday [4 
January]. The park is being built in Yunlin County on Taiwan's 
southwest coast and is scheduled to be completed by 2016. 
  Yang said four and a half years of work went into planning 
the project, including site selection, environmental evaluation, 
and geologic and water studies. 
  The industrial complex will occupy a total of 11,000 
hectares 
on reclaimed offshore land in the towns of Mailiao, Hsinhsing, 
and Sihu. The Mailiao section will contain 2,500 hectares, the 
Hsinhsing section 1,072, and the Sihu section 7,428. 
  Formosa Plastics Group is building Taiwan's sixth naphtha 
cracking plant in the Mailiao section, while the Industrial 
Development Bureau will be responsible for the development of 
the Hsinhsing and Sihu sections, which will house steelworks, 
oil refineries, and petrochemical plants, among others. 
  To facilitate transportation of raw materials and finished 
products in and out of Taiwan, two industrial ports will be 
built in Mailiao and Sihu. The ports will be able to handle 30 
million metric tons and 90 million metric tons, respectively. 
  Separately, Yang said the government has yet to make a final 
decision on whether to locate Taiwan's first-ever free trade 
area within the Sihu section. In a bid to attract multinational 
companies, Taiwan has been mulling setting up a free trade area 
to promote the island as a business operations center in the 
Asia- Pacific.

  [Text] Taipei is readjusting its policies towards Hong 
Kong in a bid to maintain its influence after the territory 
reverts to mainland rule in 1997, a Taiwan official in charge of 
Hong Kong affairs said yesterday. Cheng An-kuo, director of 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department under Taiwan's Mainland 
Affairs Council (MAC), said the review was necessary due to the 
rapid development of cross-strait relations in recent years and 
it was part of the ruling Kuomintang's "one China" strategy. 
  A pressing issue is the renewal of the aviation treaty 
between Taiwan and Hong Kong in the post-1997 era because the 
existing agreement expires next year. According to Mr. Cheng, 
negotiations were already underway between Hong Kong's Cathay 
Pacific and Taiwan's national carrier, China Airlines. While 
Cathay Pacific wanted to perpetuate its present monopoly of the 
Hong Kong-Taipei air route China Airlines preferred to open the 
business to competition, Mr. Cheng said. 
  The official believed the problem could be solved through 
further negotiations between the two companies and there was no 
need to raise the topics in political discussions between Taiwan 
and the mainland. 
  Mr. Cheng said as 1997 neared, Taiwan would seek qualitative 
change in the bilateral relations instead of expanding its 
bureaucracy in Hong Kong. For example, Taipei used to measure 
the effectiveness of its Hong Kong policies by tallying the 
numbers of Hong Kong compatriots attending the island's National 
Day celebrations. "Our mutual understanding has become the new 
yardstick," he said. 
  "We would like to improve Taiwan's image in Hong Kong 
through 
our new policies. To do that, we will evaluate our performance 
by monitoring the Hong Kong media," he said. At the same time, 
Mr. Cheng's office will strengthen its links with Hong Kong 
media. 
  Mr. Cheng confirmed that Taipei had decided that Taiwan 
government offices in Hong Kong would come under the authority 
of the MAC after 1997. The subject was likely to be raised in 
future discussions between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation 
and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. 
  However, pressure from Beijing and political changes in 
Taiwan were likely to prevent Taipei from maintaining an 
effective and influential presence in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Mr. Cheng said the Government had no choice but to keep a 
low 
profile in it activities in Hong Kong due to strong pressure 
from Beijing. "In order to be able to continue to function in 
Hong Kong after 1997, we have to adopt the strategy of `work 
hard, talk less' because we don't want to upset the Chinese 
Communists," Mr. Cheng said.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Taiwan's trade deficit 
with Japan is expected to further widen this year by 10 percent 
to U.S.$15.8 billion, Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) officials 
predicted Tuesday [4 January]. 
  The deficit in 1993 grew by 12 percent to U.S.$14.4 billion, 
the officials said. 
  They estimated that Taiwan exports to Japan this year will 
grow 2 percent to U.S.$9.1 billion, but that imports from Japan 
will increase 7 percent to U.S.$25 billion. 
  The officials said export growth generating from the 
improved 
Japanese economy will be buffered by the depreciating value of 
the yen. 
  Last year's economic slowdown in Japan and high demand in 
Taiwan, in part due to the ongoing six-year national development 
plan, were reasons behind the snowballing trade deficit, the 
officials said. 
  Electronic and electric products accounted for 45 percent of 
imports from Japan, chemical products 10 percent, steel products 
8 percent, and auto parts 7 percent. 
  Agricultural products still made up the lion's share of 
Taiwan exports to Japan, but newly-emerged industrial products, 
including chemicals, computers, machinery, and steel, have 
replaced traditional industrial exports to Japan.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- The energy cooperation 
working group under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum will sponsor an energy resources development seminar in 
Taipei next month, government sources reported Tuesday [4 
January]. 
  It is the first time Taiwan has been chosen to host an APEC 
seminar since the regional economic cooperation organization was 
formed in 1989, the sources said. 
  The seminar, to be held February 1-3, will focus on new 
energy technologies, energy conservation, more efficient uses of 
energy resources, transformation of waste into energy, the 
environmental impact of energy resources exploration, and 
regional cooperation in energy development. 
  The government-funded Industrial Technology Research 
Institute will organize the seminar with the assistance of 
Japan's New Technology Development Organization. 
  Energy administrators and experts from all APEC member 
states 
are expected to attend the seminar. APEC groups 17 economies, 
including the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, 
Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Brunei, Papua New Guinea and Mexico. 
  The Republic of China [ROC] expressed its intention to host 
the seminar in October 1992, but the APEC energy working group 
did not make a final decision on the site of the meeting until 
late last year for fear of offending Beijing. 
  APEC has in the past organized short-term study tours of 
Taiwan, but has never sponsored a formal session here. 
  APEC has nine working groups. Aside from the energy task 
force, it has panels responsible for manpower resources 
planning, technology transfer, telecommunications, fishery 
resources, transportation, tourism, trade promotion and 
investment cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- Eighty percent of 
China's prisons and reform-through-labor centers will become 
modernized and more civilized by the year 2000, said Justice 
Minister Xiao Yang today. 
  He said prisons and rehabilitation centers are not only 
places where criminals are punished, but also places where they 
are reformed and re-educated. 
  "They offer a special kind of education," said the minister 
at a national conference of judicial officials, which opened 
today. 
  The minister said that criminals should be taught both to be 
law- abiding working people and people useful to the socialist 
market economy. 
  There were 300,000 inmates in China's prisons and 
reform-through- labor centers in 1993, he said. 
  Fewer than 0.12 percent of inmates escaped from prisons and 
fewer than 1 percent from reform centers in the first 11 months 
of last year, the minister said. 
  In recent years some major changes have occurred in the 
composition of prisoners, he said. Prisoners involved in 
criminal cases and economic cases are on the rise, and there are 
more offenders who are juveniles or former public employees, he 
said. 
  The minister asked that a network be set up within three to 
five years to help to offer jobs to people who have finished 
their sentences. 
  The prisons and reform-through-labor centers should be more 
open in terms of management, he said. The inmates should have 
more contacts with society, he added.

  [Text] Jinan, December 31 (XINHUA) -- After two years' 
work, Dongming Bridge across the Yellow River recently opened to 
traffic in east China's Shandong Province. 
  President Jiang Zemin calligraphed the name-plate for the 
bridge. 
  Located at the juncture of the three provinces of Hebei, 
Shandong and Henan, the 4,142-meter-long bridge ranks second 
among the bridges over the Yellow River. 
  Construction started in October, 1991, and the bridge was 
completed four months ahead of schedule. It cost 235 million 
yuan. 
  The five-arched, big-span box beam in the middle of the 
bridge was joined successfully on its first test run. Experts 
say this is a major breakthrough in the history of China's 
bridge-building. 
  The bridge is of great importance to facilitate the 
exploration of the Zhongyuan oil field and for the region's 
development.

  [Summary] Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai municipal party 
committee, addressed a ceremony held by Shanghai Municipality to 
commemorate the centennial of Mao Zedong's birth on 25 December. 
Wu Bangguo said: "Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee, our party has upheld and developed Mao 
Zedong Thought, and actively sought a socialist construction 
path suited to our nation's conditions; it has scored tremendous 
success in this respect. The most important thing is that it 
has finally found the path of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, which Comrade Mao Zedong sought but failed to 
find in those days, thus enabling the formation of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on socialism with Chinese characteristics."

<F P=106> [Report from New York] </F>
  [Text] The following information is provided by Mr. Liu 
Jianjun [0491 1696 6511], who used to be a journalist in 
mainland China and has now emigrated to the United States. 
Zhang Yufeng, rumored in China and abroad to be Mao Zedong's 
"secret wife," was once Mao's confidential secretary and looked 
after Mao in his daily life over a long period of time. She 
recently broke her silence, which lasted over a decade, and 
accepted an interview with the mainland's top movie star, Liu 
Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987], special hostess of the television 
history program entitled "Mao Zedong's Path." At the interview, 
she revealed how she met Mao Zedong and what she saw and heard 
during that time. 
  "When I first began to work, I was with the Mudanjiang 
Railway Bureau as a dining car attendant and train announcer. 
Later, I was selected and transferred to the special purpose 
section of the Ministry of Railways. In 1960, at the age of 17, 
I was transferred to Chairman Mao's exclusive train. My first 
errand was to serve on the train that took Chairman Mao to 
Guangzhou, where he was to attend a discussion on the 
formulation of the 60-item agricultural policy. The train was 
in Guangzhou for quite some months. At the beginning, I did not 
know who the master of the train was and because we followed 
very strict discipline, I dared not try to find out. The 
exclusive train had 12 cars. Train attendants were not allowed 
to enter cars that were for leaders' use only without 
permission. On our way back to Beijing, Chairman Mao and the 
crew had a photo taken at the platform of Anhui's Bengbu 
Station, and it was then that I saw him for the first time. In 
1962, I was transferred to Chairman Mao's compartment to work, 
and in 1970, I was transferred to Zhongnanhai to work by the 
chairman's side. I started as an ordinary member of the staff. 
In 1974, I was appointed "confidential secretary." 
  "I had only seen Chairman Mao on pictures or in movies. When 
he appeared before my eyes in real life, I was very excited, so 
much so that I even forgot to greet him. But later, when I was 
with him from morning to night every day, I was no longer as 
excited as when I first met him." 
  "In my eyes, in terms of status, he was our great leader; in 
terms of knowledge, he was my teacher; in terms of age and the 
emotional aspect, he was like my father. When I went to his 
residence in Zhongnanhai to work, he was already a 77-year-old 
man. By that time, he was suffering from a number of health 
problems. Sometimes he was in a bad mood. He showed all his 
emotions: Joy, anger, sorrow, and grievances." 
  Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao ever lose his temper 
with you? 
  Zhang replied: Everybody has a temper, and so did Chairman 
Mao. When we did something wrong, or when he was in a bad mood, 
he would have a fit of temper. For instance, one time he was 
reading some documents and kept putting off his mealtime. I saw 
the dishes were getting cold, so I reminded him to have his meal 
first. Chairman got angry over this and said: Don't you see I 
am reading documents? At that moment, I felt wronged and 
thought: I do not deserve criticism for doing my best to serve 
you. Now I can see that I should not have blamed him. He was 
very old then, and yet he had to take care of major matters of 
the country. The international climate was fast-changing and 
stability at home was also in question. He was under a lot of 
stress, so his mood swings were normal. After the fit, he would 
be over it and never brood on it. 
  Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did you feel very blessed to work by 
Chairman Mao's side? 
  Zhang said: I only felt it was a big responsibility. Even 
to this day, I still feel the heavy burden on my shoulders. 
  Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Lin Biao's case have any effect on 
Chairman Mao's health? 
  Zhang replied: Yes, it did. Not just the 13 September 
incident when Lin Biao fled the country. It can be traced to 
the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee in 
1970 when his conflict with Lin Biao had intensified, which gave 
him a negative mental impact. After Lin's defection, he got 
very ill. From then on, his health went downhill. 
  Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao take tonics? 
  Zhang replied: Chairman never believed that medicines could 
cure everything. He often went for a walk and consciously ate 
mixed grains, such as corn and sweet potatoes. Sometimes he 
would also eat some wild herbs, such as purslane. He did not go 
for wheat products and found it very hard to understand why 
people in my native home eat dumplings in the New Year season. 
He said: What is so nice about dumplings? He would rather eat 
brown rice [considered inferior rice] than dumplings or steamed 
buns. But he also routinely took some tonics, such as American 
ginseng and vitamins. 
  Liu Xiaoqing asked: What was Chairman Mao's attitude 
toward death? 
  Zhang replied: One day, I heard the chairman talking about a 
proverb which goes: At the age of 73 to 84, one would leave 
this world even without the King of Hell's invitation. So I 
comforted him and said: You have a good constitution. Any 
problem will go after a good treatment. But to my surprise, he 
did not like what I said. He said: You are going against 
nature's law. Where there is life, there is death. Everybody 
has to die. To say that someone would not die is just nonsense. 
He was a materialist. He kept a composed and serene look even 
to the last moment of his life. 
  Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao leave a will? 
  Zhang said: As everybody knows, as early as in 1957, 
Chairman Mao advocated that central leaders be cremated after 
death and set an example by being the first to sign on the 
resolution about cremation. 
  Liu Xiaoqing: Chairman Mao was still learning foreign 
languages in his old age. How well did he speak them? 
  Zhang replied: The chairman liked to learn foreign 
languages. He did not stop even after he was ill in his final 
years. He used English in conversations with foreign visitors. 
Interpreters said he spoke quite well. 
  Liu Xiaoqing: Did Chairman Mao know about the big earthquake 
at Tangshan? 
  Zhang replied: Yes, he did. Before the earthquake, in June, 
he had an attack of myocardial infarction and was rescued. By 
July, his condition was a bit unstable [as published], but he 
could not move or get out of bed. When the earthquake struck on 
28 July, we were woken by the tremor and immediately rushed to 
Chairman Mao's study [shu wu 2579 1450]. He was still lying in 
bed. The medical personnel opened a big sheet and covered the 
bed in case something dropped from above. The chairman was in 
his right mind at that time and was aware that an earthquake had 
happened. Unable to say anything, he just feebly waved his 
hand, probably telling us not to panic. 
  The special interview, originally timed for eight minutes, 
actually lasted one-and-a-half hours. The time for screening 
the interview has not been decided.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Chieh-hung (7115 3381 1738): "CPC Putting </F>
Together Fourth-Generation Leadership"] 
  [Text] Last spring, the First Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC] had hardly ended when the CPC 
Central Committee put the selection, training, and grooming the 
new (fourth) generation of successors into the daily work agenda 
of the State Council and its Secretariat, and set up a "leading 
task group for new central cadres" with Jiang Zemin as group 
leader and Hu Jintao as deputy group leader. 
  An informed source revealed that at a briefing in early 
December 1993, former NPC Chairman Wan Li announced for the 
first time that members of a fourth generation of China's 
leadership were being raised and trained in parties, 
governments, and the military. Wan Li said that selecting, 
training, and grooming successors always has been a great 
concern for Comrade Xiaoping. In early 1980, Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out at a central Political Bureau session that we must 
select, train, and groom successors in party building, and that 
the past frameworks would have to go. Today, 13 years later, 
the third-generation successors with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core have shown themselves capable of party, government, and 
military leadership, and have been tested by turmoil within and 
beyond China. Training a new (fourth) generation of successors 
has been made a key agenda for the party. These potential 
successors also are playing roles in various party, government, 
and military leadership groups. 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin Heads the Effort To Train the Fourth Generation </H5>
  The informed source also said in the spring of 1993, the 
First Session of the Eighth NPC had hardly ended when the CPC 
Central Committee put the selection, training, and grooming of 
the new (fourth) generation of successors into the daily work 
agenda of the State Council and its Secretariat, and set up a 
"leading group for new central cadres" with Jiang Zemin as group 
leader and Hu Jintao as deputy group leader. Other members 
include: Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Zhang Wannian, Ding Henggao, 
Lu Feng, Song Defu, Zeng Qinghong, and Luo Gan. CPC high level 
resolutions specify: "Even at the provincial level, a leading 
group for new provincial-level cadres -- to be headed by 
provincial party secretaries -- must be set up before October 
1993." This task should be part of parties' daily agenda and 
should reported to the CPC Central Committee Secretariat. 
  Last year, after convening the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, Jiang Zemin made a point of talking 
with provincial party persons-in-charge about the problem of new 
cadres, saying: This is a very important strategic arrangement 
for the party and state, and it must be pursued vigorously. He 
also said that they must banish the thought of "waiting a while 
and slowing down a little." 
<H5>  Successors Must Pass Five Requirements </H5>
  The informed source continued: The CPC lists five 
requirements for the new cadres: 1) Loyalty to the party cause 
and socialism; 2) great enthusiasm and a great sense of 
responsibility for socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3) a 
certain level of intellectual professionalism; 4) a good 
character; and 5) he must enjoy certain authority within the 
party and with the masses. It also specified that the following 
three kinds of people are excluded from consideration: 1) The 
"three kinds of people" in the Cultural Revolution; 2) backbone 
elements in the 1989 spring-summer political turmoil (namely, 4 
June) and those found to have made serious mistakes in turmoil; 
and 3) those who have made serious economic or moral mistakes. 
Those recruited and trained do not have to be party members. 
  The leading group demands that every year central 
ministries, 
commissions, officers, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions 
pick 20-25 distinguished talents to study at the Central Party 
School. These people will be put into provincial leadership 
groups, and from there sent down to the local level for study 
and training. Ministries, commissions, offices, and 
provincial-level leaders are required to seek out, promote, and 
train talented young cadres when inspecting localities and grass 
roots areas. In selecting, training, and grooming successors, 
they must ensure a certain proportion of non-party members 
working in governments at various levels, including the 
provincial vice governor level. Those found qualified can be 
promoted to the central ministerial level. 
<H5>  More Than 1,000 Successors Are Being Trained </H5>
  The informed source also said: At present there are more 
than 1,000 people studying at advanced central party schools and 
military academies to become future cadres at the ministerial 
and commission level or with army rank. Their average age is 
47, and all are university-educated. A good many of them were 
spotted or picked by Central Committee Political Bureau members 
and State Council leaders over the last two years during 
inspection tours. The majority of these 1,000 or so people have 
certain work experience at localities, enterprises, and units, 
or some merits in troop units. Many are at the deputy 
prefectural or deputy bureau level, or have divisional, deputy 
district commander, or deputy political commissar rank in the 
Army. Some are departmental cadres at central ministries, 
committees, offices, or are general managers or party 
secretaries at major enterprises,

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] China's top legislature has launched a bi-monthly 
publication to help enhance the status of the national 
law-making body in the Chinese hierarchy. In the preface of the 
National People's Congress' (NPC) Work Bulletin, published on 
Saturday, the former national parliament head Qiao Shi said 
legislators faced an arduous task. He said the development of a 
socialist democracy and legal system should be greatly 
strengthened to meet the needs of economic reform. 
  Mr. Qiao, who is a Politburo Standing Committee member, 
underlined the significance of the formulation of economic laws. 
"(We should) strive for the establishment of a legal framework 
for a socialist market economy in the next few years," he said. 
  The bimonthly was published by the NPC Standing Committee's 
General Office. 
  Mr. Qiao said the slowness of implementing laws as well as 
violations in the past should be eliminated. The former NPC 
head said supervision of the executive branches should be 
improved. Mr. Qiao vowed to exercise the NPC's power entitled 
under China's Constitution to increase its say over national 
policies. 
  Though officially the highest organ of power, the NPC has 
more been seen as a rubberstamp parliament. 
  Mr. Qiao, who was replaced as NPC head last year, is keen on 
elevating the status of the NPC, partly to increase his power in 
the communist leadership. Legislators, he said, should build 
closer ties with the people to identify and listen to their 
problems and aspirations. "We have to be honest and have 
self-discipline and to whole-heartedly serve the people," Mr. 
Qiao said.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Zhongde (0491 1813 1795): "In Building the </F>
Socialist Cultural Market, We Must Use as Guidance Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's Theory of Building Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics -- Thoughts on Building of Cultural Market in 
Studying Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] With feelings of respect, I have read Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping from cover to 
cover. Having closed the book, I could not help pondering 
deeply: Although I have read or heard about some of the 
articles in it before, yet the publication of this epoch-making 
works as decided by the party's Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin at the core according to its extremely farsighted 
strategy is just like a magnificent theoretical building 
distinctly and completely towering aloft before me with the 
dazzling splendor of the age. This is the scientific system of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, which has been unfolded to us in this 
book. 
  This foundation works of contemporary China's Marxism has 
profoundly revealed the historical tendency and inherent law 
that governs Chinese socialist development; has charted the only 
correct course toward the prosperity of the country, the 
rejuvenation of our nation, and the happiness of the people; and 
has pointed out the only correct direction for the energetic 
advance of China's socialist cultural undertaking under the new 
historical conditions. 
  At present, we are concentrating our efforts on intensifying 
the building of the cultural market, which is a burgeoning 
domain that has been developing rapidly over the past 10 years 
or so. As an indispensable component part of China's socialist 
material and spiritual civilizations, the building of cultural 
market must be persistently guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
<H6>  I. </H6>
  Over the past 10 years or so, the vigorous rise and rapid 
growth of China's socialist cultural markets, and the impact and 
role brought about by these markets, which serve as links and 
intermediaries for promoting socialist cultural prosperity and 
the two civilizations, have almost become the most spectacular 
cultural and economic phenomenon in China since the early 
1980's. With varying views, people are either pleased, worried, 
or half-pleased, half-worried at this phenomenon. However, the 
impact of economic restructuring on the cultural structure is a 
reality independent of man's subjective will. That is why we 
should give a Marxist answer to it in conformity with China's 
national conditions. 
  The establishment of a socialist market economic structure 
is 
a major content of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. With extraordinary theoretical courage and 
realistic spirit, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "There is 
no contradiction between socialism and the market economy, so 
the question is--what methods we should apply to develop the 
productive forces of society more energetically." Aiming at the 
shackles in people's minds that have been formed under the 
planned economic structure for a long time, he repeatedly 
stressed: "We must make it clear in theory that the difference 
between capitalism and socialism does not lie in such an issue 
as planning or market. There is market economy in socialism, 
and planned control in capitalism." Over the past dozen years, 
the growth of China's commodity economy and reform of the 
economic structure have brought changes to various areas of 
China's social life in varying degrees, including the 
development of the socialist cultural markets. As the welfare 
pattern of "mass entertainment at the expense of the state" 
under the previous planned economic structure has been broken, 
and cultural markets have been the principal places of the 
people's consumption of culture, the sluggish cultural markets 
for several decades have been vigorously activated. 
Particularly after the objective of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure was defined at the 14th National Party 
Congress, cultural markets have encountered new development 
opportunities and motive forces again and advanced by leaps and 
bounds. Just take the entertainment markets as an example. 
Various kinds of cultural and recreational places across the 
country have grown from 80,000 in 1990 to 200,000. Today, 
cultural markets have become important sites for people to 
engage in cultural activities. 
  After we have read through the Selected Works, it 
is not difficult for us to understand that the fundamental 
objective of establishing a socialist market economic structure 
is to accelerate the development of productive forces. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping repeatedly pointed out: "The basic tenet of 
Marxism is to develop productive forces," and the "most 
fundamental task at the socialist stage is the development of 
productive forces." Just as the development of socialist market 
economy will certainly bring about comprehensive changes in 
China's economic structure because of the necessity to develop 
productive forces, the prosperity of socialist cultural markets 
will certainly bring about opportunities and challenges for 
change in China's cultural structure because of the necessity to 
develop culture and art. The report of the 14th national party 
congress pointed out: "The establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure involves a number of areas in China's 
economic base and superstructure and calls for a series of 
appropriate structural reforms and policy readjustments." This 
has clearly told us that the changes will not only vigorously 
shake China's economic field and reform China's basic mode of 
economic operation, but also vigorously shake China's cultural 
field and launch a powerful onslaught upon the primary creation, 
the organizational modes, and the pattern of supply and demand 
of culture and art. Therefore, we should note that reform to 
abolish the old cultural structure and establish a new one so 
that it is suited to the socialist market economic structure has 
undoubtedly become a historical necessity. 
  Although changes will get things straightened out, yet if 
the 
cultural structural reform is to push literature and art as well 
as cultural workers into the markets, or to be carried out at 
the costs of losing the spirit of cultural workers and lowering 
the quality of literature and art, as some people think, then, 
the cultural structural reform will deviate from the correct 
path. The cultural structural reform must be suited to the 
socialist market economic structure and at the same time conform 
with the requirements of socialist spiritual civilization and 
the laws governing the self- development of culture and art. We 
should both note the internal relations between cultural and 
economic structural reforms and their generality in some 
aspects, and at the same time fully understand their own laws 
and specific properties. Only by accurately grasping this point 
can we attain healthy and smooth development in the cultural 
structural reform. As an important part and parcel of the 
socialist market economy, China's cultural markets will 
certainly abide by the rules and general laws governing markets 
in development. However, as the creation of cultural products 
is complicated mental labor, its rise and fall as well as 
success and failure cannot be totally decided by market rules. 
Besides, as relations between long-term development and 
short-term consumption of the cultural undertaking must be 
correctly handled, the regulation of their proportions cannot be 
totally decided by material gain and conduct of markets. What 
is more, as products that are put into the cultural markets have 
both the properties of commodity and ideology, selection of them 
cannot be totally decided by the commercial gains and losses of 
the markets. These characteristics of our socialist cultural 
market calls for us to exercise even more direct and powerful 
regulation and control of these markets through policy, legal, 
economic, and administrative means. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
put forth the scientific criteria for judging the nature, gain, 
loss, success, and failure of reform, which have provided us 
with theoretical bases for judging the gain, loss, success, and 
failure of cultural structural reform. Specifically speaking, 
there are three criteria for judgment-- whether or not reform is 
beneficial to fully mobilizing and displaying the initiative and 
creativity of the vast number of literary and artistic workers, 
to turning out literary and artistic works and qualified 
personnel for the prosperity of the socialist cultural 
undertaking to satisfy the increasing demands of the people's 
cultural life, and to promoting economic development and 
comprehensive social progress. 
<H6>  II. </H6>
  In 1985, in light of the tendency of bourgeois 
liberalization 
and money worship which emerged on the ideological and cultural 
fronts at that time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: 
"Ideological, cultural, educational, and public health 
departments should take social effectiveness as the only 
criterion for all activities, and enterprises which they belong 
to should also take social effectiveness as their highest 
criterion." As these expositions have made unequivocal judgment 
on specific characteristics, they not only seized hold of the 
primary issue of ideological and cultural work, but are of 
tremendous guiding significance to the building of China's 
socialist cultural markets. Just as Marx said: "The difficulty 
lies just in the general expression of these contradictions. 
Once their specific characteristics are defined, they are 
clearly explained." 
  Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Marxist mode of judgment, 
we might well see how practice has revealed the specific 
characteristics of China's socialist cultural markets. 
  First, contemporary China's cultural markets are part and 
parcel of the socialist market economic system on one hand, and 
a major area of the socialist spiritual civilization on the 
other. Their healthy development can only be achieved by 
serving the socialist material and spiritual civilizations. 
Such dual properties of China's socialist cultural markets have 
determined that they cannot under any circumstances simply and 
passively adapt themselves to the general rules and modes of 
market operations, but that, while correctly reflecting 
circulating and regulating functions, they should fully display 
functions in various aspects including recreational 
appreciation, exchange of information, education through 
propaganda, cultural accumulation, and so on, with a view to 
satisfying people's demands at different levels in their 
cultural life; promoting socialist spiritual civilization; 
pushing forward cultural structural reform; augmenting the 
self-developing vitality of cultural units; giving impetus to 
the development of community- run cultural industries; improving 
investment environment and tapping tax sources to bring about 
economic prosperity; enhancing the competitiveness of national 
culture in the international cultural markets; facilitating the 
cultural exchange with foreign countries, and so on. 
  Second, as major objects of circulation in cultural markets, 
intellectual products have their specific patterns which are 
different from ordinary material products. This has likewise 
conditioned the specific characteristics of China's socialist 
cultural markets as follows: 1) The creation of cultural 
products is different from that of material products. In a 
strict sense, the production of commodities is solely for the 
purpose of exchange. Objectively, all cultural products in the 
true sense are also for the purpose of exchange but, 
fundamentally speaking, they are personal creations of literary 
and artistic workers, and vivid reflection of their great 
enthusiasm and true strength. 2) Compared with material 
products, it is more difficult to accurately calculate the time 
of labor necessary for cultural products. It is also very 
difficult to compare the time taken to create literary and 
artistic works by different persons even in the same category of 
cultural work. 3) In the economic area, the more developed the 
commodity economy is, the more necessary it is to abide by the 
principle of exchange at equal value. Now, as in the past, it 
is difficult for cultural products to realize universal and real 
exchange at equal value even in the most developed country in 
the world which practices commodity economy. 4) The difference 
in the value of utility. The value of utility for ordinary 
commodities should play a similar part in satisfying the demands 
of different customers. As consumers have an identical 
yardstick for commodities, it is possible to compete on an 
entirely equal footing. But the value of utility in cultural 
products is closely related to subjective elements of consumers, 
that is, people have very different measurements and attitudes 
toward the value of the utility of cultural products with 
ideological tints owing to consumers' varying stands, views, and 
cultural standards. In face of the social and economic 
effectiveness naturally brought forth by commodity properties 
and specific characteristics pertinent to intellectual products, 
we must work hard to achieve the dialectical unity of social and 
economic effectiveness in our socialist cultural markets, while 
persistently placing social effectiveness in a primary position. 
  Since reform and opening up, trials and hardships in China's 
construction of socialist cultural markets have undoubtedly 
shown that the crucial link of fundamentally placing social 
effectiveness in a primary position and really achieving the 
dialectical unity of effectiveness in the two aspects is what 
kind of intellectual products we should use to occupy the 
socialist cultural markets and give positive and healthy 
guidance to the masses in their cultural market consumption. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "With regard to our 
literature and art, greater efforts should be made to depict and 
foster new socialist individuals to yield fruitful results. We 
should portray the pioneers of the four modernizations, reflect 
their brand new appearance with revolutionary idealism and a 
scientific approach, lofty sentiments and creativeness, and a 
broad vision and realistic spirit. Through the images of these 
new individuals, we should inspire the socialist enthusiasm of 
the broad masses and promote their activities of historic 
creation for the four modernizations." Here, proceeding from 
the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, Comrade Deng Xiaoping advanced the issue of how 
we should loudly raise the main melody of the spirit of the age 
in contemporary China's socialist spiritual civilization, which 
actually exists. As far as literary and artistic creation is 
concerned, it is the issue of how we should loudly raise the 
main melody of the creation of literary and artistic works. 
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that reflection of the spirit of the 
age should be the main melody of our literature and art. He 
pointed out: "Patriotism, socialism, and collectivism should 
become the main melody of our society." 
  There is always the spirit of the age which holds a leading 
position in the comprehensive ideological and cultural 
development in any society at all times. As a reflection of 
aesthetic views in social life, literary and artistic creation 
must also have its own main melody. In contemporary China, this 
melody is identical with that in actual life. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the party's basic line, principles, and 
policies, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism are the main 
melody of the actual life in contemporary China. Therefore, in 
literary and artistic creation, the main melody we refer to 
should be the mainstream of creation formed by art and 
literature with artistic charm and healthy content, which take 
great pains to reflect the spirit of the age and encourage 
people to positively dedicate themselves to the great practice 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The more 
resonant this main melody of art and literature is, the more 
powerful it will be at serving the people and socialism and the 
principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred 
schools of thought contend. 
  The actual social life and the people's demands for culture 
are rich, colorful, and diversified. Our literary and artistic 
creations, including the works of main melody, should also be 
rich, colorful, and diversified in theme, form, style, and 
method of expression. In other words, while stressing to loudly 
raise the main melody, we must encourage this diversity. This 
is the practical and dialectical view of correctly handling 
relations between the two aspects. Only by achieving this 
dialectical unity of integrating theory with practice can we 
create fine literary and artistic works which are suited to both 
refined and popular tastes, and which are worthy of the great 
age without precedent; fill the socialist cultural markets with 
intellectual products having artistic charm and healthy content, 
which particularly sing the praises of reform, opening up, and 
modernization; guide the people in their consumption of culture; 
and push forward the healthy advance of cultural markets. 
<H6>  III. </H6>
  The idea of "doing two types of work simultaneously" is a 
major component part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the 
concrete application of dialectical materialism in the process 
of our socialist modernization with great creative spirit. With 
regard to the overall building of the country, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "We must pay special attention to the 
building of material civilization. Meanwhile, we must build 
socialist spiritual civilization as well." On the issue of 
handling the relation between reform and stability, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "We must grasp reform and opening up with 
one hand, and the crackdown on various kinds of criminal 
activities with the other." On the issue of the production of 
art and literature, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: 
"Cultural circles should create more quality intellectual 
products, and resolutely check the production, importation, and 
circulation of harmful products." There is another prominent 
point in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of "doing two types of 
work simultaneously"--we must not stress material progress at 
the expense of cultural and ideological progress, but attach 
equal importance to both. The stand, view, and method of "doing 
two types of work simultaneously" not only play an important 
guiding role in controlling at macro level the overall situation 
of China's socialist modernizations, but also serve as powerful 
weapons in building socialist cultural markets with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Since reform and opening up, China's cultural markets have 
developed very rapidly to include markets of entertainment, 
audio- visual equipment, press and publication, fine arts, 
performances, films, historical relics, cultural exchanges with 
foreign countries, training in art and culture, and others, in a 
comprehensive way, from the previous simple markets of cinemas, 
television shows, theaters, book stalls, newsstands, and booths 
for folk performances. The present markets have played an 
irreplaceable role in promoting the economy, satisfying and 
enriching the people's life, and developing socialist cultural 
undertakings. At present, however, China is in the 
developmental period, the growth of cultural markets has not yet 
matured, and there are very chaotic phenomena in the course of 
rapid development. In this regard, we must acquire a sober 
understanding and adopt resolute and powerful measures to 
resolve them. 
  To sum up, there are six major serious problems in cultural 
markets: First, in the press, publication, and audio-visual 
markets, illegal business activities such as smuggling, 
trafficking, stealing of copyrights, reselling of publication 
numbers at a profit, and others, are increasingly rampant. 
Illegal publications of inferior quality and low prices are 
flooding in, disrupting markets and throwing state-owned 
publishers into an extremely dire predicament. In the meantime, 
some state publishing units also engaged in very serious 
activities such as reselling publication numbers at a profit, 
and so on, thus providing chances to illegal elements for their 
wrongdoings. Recently, concentrated efforts have been made to 
crack down on them and, although they have pulled in their horns 
for the moment, yet the matter is far from being solved. Second, 
markets are flooded with pornographic books, periodicals, and 
audio and video tapes in increasingly large volume, extensive 
circulation, and open forms. Owing to the repeated failure of 
banning them, they have seriously polluted the social 
environment and impaired the physical and mental health of the 
broad masses, young people in particular. Third, pornographic 
activities in some entertainment sites have gained ground to a 
certain extent, and some of them even solicit customers with sex 
services to reap exorbitant profits in an imposing manner. In 
this way, they have poisoned the social atmosphere and damaged 
the image of the party and country. Fourth, some operators of 
video game centers are engaged in gambling under cover of lucky 
draws, complying with relevant state regulations overtly but 
opposing them covertly, and turning entertainment sites into 
gambling houses, which is absolutely incompatible with our 
socialist system. Fifth, in the performances of overseas film 
and television stars and singers, the abnormal tendencies 
including enterprise sponsorship with public funds, high ticket 
prices, expensive admission fees, andf tax evasion, among other 
things, are very serious. Sixth, the film market has shrunk, 
and the targets for shows, audience, issues, and income continue 
to decline. In order to contend for audience with the centers 
of video shows projected by laser compact discs, some individual 
localities even disregard relevant regulations and vie with each 
other to show "documentary films" and "category III films," 
which has produced an adverse effect in society. 
  There are complicated reasons for the emergence and spread 
of 
the above problems. They are problems of ideological 
understanding, operating direction, improper management 
structure, ineffective macroscopic regulation and control, 
unsound policies and statutes, relaxed law enforcement, and 
defiance of law. The basic idea of resolving these problems is 
to adhere to the principle of "doing two types of work 
simultaneously" proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in building 
socialist material and spiritual civilizations. To implement 
concretely the principle in the cultural markets, we should 
persistently intensify management to eliminate cultural garbage 
on the one hand, and occupy and enrich cultural markets with 
flourishing, healthy, and useful cultural products on the other. 
Moreover, we should adopt powerful measures to guide and rectify 
cultural markets to exercise the positive role of cultural 
markets and check their negative role to the maximum. To be 
specific, the following tasks are extremely necessary: 
  First, laying equal stress on purification and prosperity. 
At present, there are a number of problems in cultural markets 
where the good is mingled with the bad and the sham with the 
genuine. We make great efforts to rectify and purify the 
markets. Certainly, this is a long-term and arduous mission. 
We must take control of it constantly and unflinchingly. Our 
attitude is very definite: Never allow phenomena of sexuality, 
pornography, murder, violence, feudal superstition, and gambling 
to exist in our cultural markets. With regard to spiritual 
civilization, stress should be laid on the building of it. 
Apart from intensifying management and rectification, it is all 
the more important to concentrate our efforts on prosperity, let 
more healthy, useful, rich, and colorful cultural products which 
reflect the main melody of the age and appeal to both the more 
and the less cultured occupy cultural markets and satisfy the 
masses' increasing demands for diversified culture, so that the 
pernicious cultural rubbish will not gain a foothold. In this 
sense, prosperity is a matter of vital importance in changing 
the current condition of the cultural markets. 
  Second, laying equal stress on bringing about a temporary 
and a permanent solution. In recent years, the party Central 
Committee and the State Council seriously heeded the struggle of 
eliminating pornography and cracking down on criminal activities 
in the area of illegal publications. Through several 
concentrated actions and comprehensive management, problems in 
the cultural markets have been resolved to some extent. This is 
absolutely necessary. However, after the concentrated 
crackdown, we must adopt effective measures to put an end once 
and for all to deep-rooted problems of the cultural markets. 
The national cultural market work meeting, which has just 
ended, put forththe following: While carrying out their annual 
examination, cultural and administrative departments in all 
localities must check all dancing halls and karaoke saloons 
again, and issue licenses for carrying on cultural business 
printed by the Ministry of Culture to those that meet with 
approval. As for those that do not come up to requirements, 
their business permits will be withdrawn. During this winter 
and the coming spring, video show centers (including those using 
laser discs) must be reexamined once, and priority should be 
given to banning the video show business which is privately 
operated or which is in a disguised form of private operation. 
Besides, conditions should be created to practice a system, 
under which video show centers must submit a monthly show 
schedule to the local competent departments. As regards the 
press and publication market, it is necessary to continue taking 
firm control of "eliminating pornography" and dealing blows to 
illegal publications. Apart from the aforementioned measures, 
we must accelerate the process of legislation, and perfect laws 
and regulations on the management of cultural markets, which are 
the fundamental guarantee for promoting the healthy growth of 
these markets. 
  Third, laying equal stress on adopting protective 
preferential measures and exercising restrictive tax control. 
China's cultural markets are both an important part of the 
socialist economic system and a major area of the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization. Their socialist nature has 
conditioned that it is impossible for them to emerge and perish 
of themselves or to rise and ebb of themselves as in some 
capitalist countries. Government departments must adopt 
protective and restrictive means to exercise macroeconomic 
regulation and control to indicate the state's intention of 
guiding cultural markets. At present, the decline of elegant 
artistic performances has formed a sharp contrast to the 
overheated performances of singers and "stars" in the markets. 
In view of the above facts, we should adopt a fostering 
attitude toward the former, and pertinent departments nationwide 
should formulate policies as quickly as possible and provide 
preferential policies to them in terms of performance tax, 
management fees, transportation charges, and site charges. On 
the other hand, they should employ economic and administrative 
means to guide social sponsorship to prevent loss of public 
funds and to limit performance fees and ticket prices of the 
performances put on by singers or "stars" to prevent the 
phenomenon of the inferior winning and the superior being 
eliminated in cultural markets. In addition, it is necessary to 
use economic policies, tax policies in particular, to curb the 
blind pursuit of high-grade entertainment sites calling for high 
consumption and to concentrate efforts on developing some 
medium- and low-grade entertainment sites to meet the demands of 
the broad masses. What needs to be pointed out is that to 
regulate the markets we cannot help but adopt protective and 
restrictive means aimed at checking in good time some major 
deviations that have arisen in cultural markets because of their 
inability to regulate themselves, so that cultural markets as a 
whole will be able to operate in an orderly and healthy way and 
will incrementally advance toward higher levels. 
  Fourth, laying equal stress on government conduct and social 
supervision. Along with the rise and growth of cultural 
markets, appropriate management organs have been set up, a 
contingent of law enforcement personnel have been formed, and a 
national management network at central, provincial, prefectural, 
county, and township and town levels has basically taken shape 
boasting ranks of 150,000 full- and part-time personnel. This 
is the precondition as well as guarantee for managing cultural 
markets by government departments. Alongside the development of 
cultural markets, management tasks are more and more heavy and 
difficult. Hence, it is imperative to mobilize social forces to 
supervise markets. Very useful experience has been gained by 
Shenzhen in this respect. The method of "management by three 
parties" has been adopted by this city, that is, 1) management 
by the state--exercising regulation and control, giving 
guidance, conducting examination, and meting out punishment 
according to relevant administrative rules and regulations; 2) 
management by the trade--assisting government functional 
departments to exercise self-management by the trade association 
according to relevant laws, rules, and regulations; and 3) 
management by society--mobilizing people in society to exercise 
supervision and management, and through the information provided 
by part-time checking personnel to promptly report the 
lawbreaking and discipline-violating acts of operators. In this 
way, management channels for cultural markets have been 
broadened so that government departments have had management 
"assistants," thus forming a management pattern of "small 
government, large society." Moreover, we must also use social 
and mass supervisory instruments such as public opinion, 
morality, and so on, to promote the healthy growth of China's 
socialist cultural markets. 
  Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there would not 
be revolutionary movements." Judging from the course of reform 
and opening up over the past dozen years, the process of China's 
socialist modernization, as a changing movement in the 
development of things, has never for a moment deviated from the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, both the building of 
material or spiritual civilization, and both the prosperity of 
the socialist literary and artistic undertaking or the 
development of the socialist cultural markets, have called for 
the entire literary and artistic workers, leading cadres at all 
levels on the literary and artistic front in particular, to 
master comprehensively, accurately, systematically, and 
scientifically Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics through in-depth study of 
the Selected Works. Only by so doing can we have the 
reliable guarantee for fulfilling the heavy responsibilities we 
are shouldering. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed: "If our 
party has a large number of comrades who systematically, rather 
than fragmentarily, and practically, rather than superficially, 
master the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and who are able to apply this theory to the 
study and solution of major problems, then our party's ability 
to lead reform, opening up, and socialist modernization will be 
substantially enhanced."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cong Gong: "Draft Aims at Better Birth </F>
and Health Care"] 
  [Text] The draft Law of Better Birth and Health Care for 
Mother and Child is awaiting approval by the Standing Committee 
of the National People's Congress, China's highest law-making 
body, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health. 
  The law is aimed at reducing the number of seriously sick 
and 
disabled babies, safeguarding the health of mothers and children 
and, finally fostering healthier generations in the future. 
  The draft law requires doctors to advise a couple to 
terminate a pregnancy if a hereditary disease is liable to 
result in the birth of seriously sick or disabled babies, or if 
continuing the pregnancy would put the women's life at risk or 
seriously jeopardize her health or that of the fetus. 
  The spokesman explained that abortions could ultimately be 
carried out only with the agreement of the pregnant woman or her 
guardian. 
  This provision indicates that the law respects the right of 
individuals to make their own judgments, and reflects the 
principle of combining government guidance with individual 
choice, he said. 
  China is the most populous country on the globe, with 
one-fourth of the world's people. Its birth policy focuses not 
only on controlling the size of the population but also on 
improving its quality. 
  The previous four decades have seen remarkable improvement 
in 
the health of Chinese people, with the maternal mortality rate 
dropping from 1,500 per 100,000 before 1949 to 94.7 per 100,000 
now. 
  Marriages between close relatives, endemic diseases and 
congenital hereditary ailments, however, make it difficult to 
control the births of seriously sick and retarded children in 
some areas, especially remote and impoverished rural regions. 
  The situation therefore calls for a Law of Better Birth and 
Health Care for Mother and Child to be enacted as soon as 
possible, he said. 
  "Better birth" in this law is completely different from the 
racist "eugenics" pursued by Adolf Hitler under the guise of 
better birth. 
  The law entitles Chinese citizens to premarital health 
check-ups; health care before, during and after delivery; 
antenatal diagnosis; health care for the newborn; screening for 
neonatal diseases; and better counselling for parents. 
  According to the draft law, certain couples will be required 
to postpone marriage or take long-term contraceptive measures 
after marriage. 
  This would apply to people diagnosed as having reproductive 
diseases, hereditary diseases that lead to seriously sick or 
disabled children, schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychoses and 
other severe psychoses, or acute infectious diseases, including 
venereal diseases. 
  Such a mandate is compatible with some provisions in the 
nation's Marriage Laws. According to the spokesman, in drafting 
the law of better birth and child care the Ministry of Public 
Health conducted feasibility and necessity studies on a national 
scale. 
  In the past 40 years, a relatively complete network of 
medical care has been established throughout the country. Six 
medical universities in Beijing and Shanghai offer courses on 
maternity and child care. 
  Moreover, China has six national institutions on better 
birth 
and child care, and 346 maternity and child care hospitals. 
  There are 149,105 maternity and child care technicians in 
the 
nation, and 533 clinics have been set up for antenatal 
diagnosis. In 1992, the premarital check-up rate reached 99 
percent in Shanghai and 72 per cent in Liaoning Province. 
  According to the spokesman, there is still a long way to go 
in improving the quality of the nation's population to the point 
where the belief that a large family means good fortune can be 
overcome.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, received Cheng Tong Fatt, ambassador of Singapore in 
China, in the Guoji Building noon on 22 December. 
  During the reception Gao Dezhan said: Tianjin is further 
broadening its program of opening up and accelerating the 
utilization of foreign capital, and cooperating with foreign 
countries in all directions, in multiple fields, and at multiple 
levels. The municipality welcomes investments and projects of 
foreign countries in every corner in the world. 
  Gao Dezhan welcomed the arrival of Ambassador Cheng Tong 
Fatt. He said: Opening the municipality to the outside world 
and utilizing foreign capital represents a fundamental plan for 
the municipality to accelerate its development. Tianjin has 
many land resources and foundations of industry and commerce. 
It also possesses scientific and technological forces and 
convenient air, maritime, and highway transportation 
facilities. Based on existing cooperation with Singapore, we 
are willing to further more extensive, in depth cooperation on a 
larger scale. In order to become one of the country's best, most 
attractive regions for foreign investments, Tianjin must make it 
easy for foreign businessmen and firms to invest their money in 
the municipality, and make things convenient and profitable. We

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "Fueling Growth With Nuke </F>
Power"] 
  [Text] China is speeding nuclear power plant construction 
to fuel its dynamic economic growth. 
  By the year 2000, the country's nuclear power plants will 
have a capacity of 6 million kilowatts while new plants with 
another 6 million kilowatts in capacity will be under 
construction, You Deliang, a spokesman of the China National 
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said yesterday. 
  China's first nuclear power station, at Qinshan in Zhejiang 
Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, You added. 
  And, by the end of this year, experts predict it will have 
generated 1.73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since it 
was linked to the national grid in December 1991. 
  Work on Qinshan's second phase, two generators with a 
capacity of 600,000 kilowatts each, has also begun. 
  Meanwhile, Generator No 1 at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station is expected to go into commercial operation soon, while 
Generator No 2 will go into commercial operation before next 
June. 
  Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, near Shenzhen in Guangdong 
is 
the country's first joint-venture nuclear power plant. 
  Its two generators are designed to generate 10 to 12.6 
billion kilowatthours of electricity a year, he said. 
  The power will be sold to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong 
to 
support their economic development. 
  CNNC President Jiang Xinxiong said the establishment of the 
two power stations was a milestone for China's nuclear power 
industry. 
  The Chinese began late in this field and must strive to make 
advances to fuel the country's economic growth, he said. 
  China's booming economy has also provided a huge market for 
nuclear energy, Jiang said. 
  Provinces, especially in Southeast China's coastal areas, 
consider nuclear power an important means to meet their 
increasing energy demands. 
  Jiang said the corporation had also made big strides in 
developing nuclear fuel. 
  A production line, introduced from France to produce pressed 
[as published] water reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel has been built 
and is due to go into production next year. 
  Jiang said CNNC's industrial output in 1993 rose 37.7 
percent 
compared to last year. In addition, CNNC is trying to grab a 
share of the international market by exporting its nuclear power 
generators. 
  Pakistan is negotiating with China to import a second 
300,000- kilowatt generator now that the first one is being 
built.

<F P=106> [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- Since China's nuclear 
industry embarked upon its second pioneering undertaking of 
"converting military installations to civilian production" at 
the beginning of the eighties, it has given equal emphasis to 
research and development. China not only has leaped to a new 
height in scientific research in the nuclear field and in the 
peaceful use of nuclear technology, but at the same time it has 
also achieved a new glorious round on the major front of the 
national economy. 
  At a news conference held today by the China National 
Nuclear 
Corporation, its President Jiang Xinxiong summarized the 
achievements the nuclear industry made in 1993 as follows: The 
nuclear power industry has developed steadily; new progress has 
been made in the nuclear fuel industry and in related scientific 
research; civilian production has achieved relatively large 
growth; the nuclear industry has further developed domestic and 
foreign markets; and scientific research has yielded a number of 
significant achievements. 
  Nuclear power construction, being the main focus and 
strategic objective of the second pioneering undertaking, has 
achieved major progress since the beginning of the nineties. 
Since it started to generate power after hooking up with the 
power grid two years ago, the Qinshan Nuclear Plant, the first 
nuclear plant designed and built by China itself, has 
successfully increased its generating power in stages to full 
capacity, and fulfilled all its trial assignments. Currently, 
it is in a stage of safe, reliable, and high-power trial 
operations, which signifies that China's nuclear technology has 
entered a mature stage of development. The Daya Bay Nuclear 
Plant is one of the largest Sino-foreign joint ventures since 
the implementation of reform and open policy. The No. 1 
generating unit, which successfully generated power after 
hooking up with the power grid in August this year, and 
fulfilled full-capacity operations in November, is expected to 
go into commercial production in February next year. The No. 2 
generating unit will also be completed and put into operation in 
June 1994. It has been learned that when the two generating 
units are wholly put into commercial production, their annual 
generating capacity can reach 10 to 12.6 billion kw-hours. The 
designing of the second phase of the Qinshan Power Plant is in 
full swing, and gratifying progress has been made in site 
preparation work, with the recent opening of nearly 1,000 meters 
of tunnels. This shows that nuclear power has become an option 
for clearing the energy "bottleneck" in China, especially in the 
southeast coastal provinces and regions. 
  The achievements in nuclear scientific research have been 
remarkable. Over the last 10 years, the nuclear industrial 
established has won state-class science and technology prizes 
for 330 projects. Research and designing work on the 300,000-kw 
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, research into controlled nuclear 
fusion for China's No. 1 convector, the construction of a tandem 
accelerator laboratory, ground heap leaching technology in 
mineral and metallurgical fields, and the technology of 
separating uranium isotopes through centrifugal means have all 
yielded a number of significant scientific and technological 
achievements. It is learned that the key scientific research 
project for constructing a 600,000-kw nuclear plant is making 
good progress. Research into the disposal of radioactive wastes 
generated by nuclear installations has yielded results in 
various stages. What is even more eye- catching is that new 
breakthroughs have been made in enriched uranium production 
technology and equipment. The production line for producing 
components for a 900,000-kw pressurized water reactor imported 
by the 812 Plant from France has already been completed and has 
been appraised and examined by the French side. It will acquire 
production capacity next year and provide replacement fuel for 
the first furnace in the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant. 
  Our country has also actively developed and utilized 
nuclear and related technologies to serve national economic 
construction. At present, our country has developed a number of 
pillar-type nonmilitary industries by using those technologies, 
including chemical fertilizers, titanium dioxide, metal 
magnesium, and fire alarms. The output value of items for 
nonmilitary use now accounts for more than 70 percent of the 
total output value of the nuclear industry. The application of 
radioactive isotopes in agriculture, industry, and medicine has 
created "nuclear agriculture," "nuclear medicine," and other 
specialized sciences. The radiation processing industry is 
developing in our country with an annual output value of more 
than 400 million yuan. All these have shown that nuclear 
technology has unnoticeably entered our daily lives. 
  Meanwhile, our country has also actively strengthened 
economic and foreign trade work in the field of nuclear 
technology. Our country has exported nuclear products, nuclear 
technology, and nuclear engineering for peaceful use. We have 
exported nuclear power stations and nuclear reactors for 
research purposes to Pakistan, Iran, Algeria, and other 
countries [deng guo jia 4583 0948 1367], and China's 
nuclear-electric technology is now entering the international 
market.

<F P=106> [Report: "Liu Jiyuan, Responsible Person of China's </F>
Aerospace Industry, Reveals in Hong Kong That China Has More 
Than 30 Contracts To Launch Foreign Satellites"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Liu Jiyuan, a responsible official of 
China's astronautics industry, said that the satellite launched 
by China in early October did not fall to the earth and the 
department concerned was still tracing the satellite. It was 
expected that it would continue to orbit several months. He 
said that many Western reports about the satellite were 
inaccurate. 
  Liu Jiyuan, president of China's Aerospace Industry 
Corporation, yesterday attended the topping-out ceremony of the 
ground control station of Asia-Pacific Communications Satellite 
Corporation in Hong Kong. After the ceremony, he was asked 
about the fall of the satellite launched by China on 8 October 
into the Pacific Ocean as the United States alleged. He pointed 
out that the foreign reports were inaccurate on many points, and 
he also denied that the satellite had fallen to earth. 
  Liu Jiyuan revealed that the Chinese department concerned 
was 
still tracing the satellite which failed to return on time, and 
monitoring of its movement. China did not plan to retrieve the 
satellite because it had almost used up its energy and would 
eventually fall. However, it will continue to orbit for a 
fairly long time, and it is expected that it will remain in the 
outer space several months. 
  He did not think that the fall of the satellite would cause 
any catastrophe. "Like other foreign satellites, when they fell 
to the ground they had almost burned out and become ashes, and 
nothing was be left." 
  As for China's future plan, Liu Jiyuan said that applied 
satellites will be developed to meet the needs of economic 
construction, including communications and meteorological 
satellites and mobile communications facilities. Now, the State 
Aerospace Bureau is vigorously promoting international 
satellite-launching services, and has more than 30 foreign 
satellite-launching contracts, including some from the United 
States.

<F P=106> [Report: "China's Aerospace Industry Sets Great Store by </F>
Role of Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Today, Hong Kong's China Aerospace International 
Holdings Limited held a party to mark the 1994 New Year. Liu 
Jiyuan, president of the China Aerospace Industry Corporation 
[CAIC] and honorary chairman of the board of directors of the 
China Aerospace International Holdings Limited [CAIH] flew in 
from Beijing specifically to host the party. He said: As the 
parent company of CAIH, CAIC will pay great attention to its 
development because it is an important window through which the 
will proceed to the world. We will surely make a success of it. 
In addition to financially supporting CAIH's business, we will 
also support its development with high-tech products and 
high-tech personnel resources. In particular, we will have to 
choose some high-quality and high-efficiency high-tech projects 
and inject them into CAIH, the example being the just announced 
Guizhou-Jiangnan auto project, so that CAIH's product mix can be 
readjusted in a comparatively short time, changing the outlook 
of its operation and management, and so that it will produce 
comparatively ideal economic returns after one to three years. 
  He said: CAIC is a technology-led company which integrates 
technology, industry, and trade, and which is directly under the 
PRC State Council. It was reorganized and set up in June 1993 
against the background of reform and opening up and on the basis 
of the former Fifth Research Institute of the National Defense 
Ministry set up in October 1956, which eventually evolved into 
the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building, to the Astronautics 
Industry Ministry, and to the Ministry of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics Industry. CAIC has accumulated scientific and 
technological achievements and management experience over the 
past 40 years or more in the astronautics industry, and 
possesses powerful scientific and technological strength and 
rich management experience, forming a complete air-ground 
integrated system that researches, designs, experiments with, 
and produces carrier rockets, satellites, and other applied 
ground-based systems. CAIC has large comprehensive research 
academies including the China Carrier Rocket Research Academy 
and the China Space Technology Academy and over 300 research 
institutes, three colleges of higher learning, and six large and 
medium-sized enterprise groups. Under CAIC are research and 
educational institutes and various types of enterprises in 24 
provinces and municipalities across the country. It has 270,000 
employees of whom 100,000 are professional technical personnel 
and 40,000 are senior professional technical personnel. CAIC 
currently has assets totaling 30 billion yuan and annual sales 
of 8 billion yuan and earns a post-tax net profit of 
approximately one billion yuan. 
  CAIC mainly develops, produces, and deals in all types of 
aerospace products and launches all types of series carrier 
rockets and various types of applied satellites and scientific 
experimental satellites including telecommunications and 
broadcasting, meteorological, and earth resources survey 
satellites, and various types of earth receivers and applied 
systems. CAIC is utilizing the high-tech advantages it 
possesses to develop a variety of fair-sized and marketable 
civilian products covering electronics, telecommunications, 
computers, industrial automation control, petrochemistry, 
medical equipment, autos, and all kinds of home electrical 
appliances. It has obtained comparatively good economic returns 
by developing and dealing in these civilian products. 
  In the past two decades, eight models of the Long March 
series carrier rockets have been developed and manufactured by 
China. As of the end of 1993, China had succeeded in launching 
36 satellites, five of which were successfully launched into 
preset orbits for overseas customers. At present, China 
possesses world advanced technology in retrieving satellites, 
launching several satellites with one rocket, and launching 
stationary satellites. It also has fixed-point, satellite 
survey and control, and rocket high-energy and low-temperature 
technology. Each year, CAIC is awarded by various ministries 
for over 500 scientific and technological achievements and by 
the state for a dozen or more achievements. 
  Since reform and opening up, CAIC has established good 
cooperative ties with foreign businesses and has set up 21 
solely funded enterprises and joint ventures in the United 
States, Canada, Australia, and Russia. Moreover, it has set up 
55 joint-ventures and cooperative enterprises with other 
countries in China. CAIC and its affiliated companies have 
always maintained a good cooperative relationship with Hong 
Kong. CAIC launched the satellite Asiat-1 for the Asia 
Satellite Company Limited, whose headquarters are in Hong Kong, 
with the carrier rocket Long March Three and succeeded in 
completing the Buddha Tian Tan project on Lantau Island, Hong 
Kong. 
  Furthermore, CAIC carries out technological cooperation and 
has business ties with many countries, consortia, and 
corporations around the world. Recently, it signed an agreement 
with the U.S. Motorola Corporation by which the corporation will 
for the first time invest $40 million to jointly develop an 
iridium satellite system. It has also signed an agreement with 
the corporation to launch satellites and build three mobile 
telecommunications ground stations for it. The company has 
signed an agreement with Brazil to develop and launch resource 
survey satellites and with Germany's MBB corporation to jointly 
develop satellites. It has also set up a joint venture, the 
Huadi Computer Company, with Digital, a U.S. corporation. CAIC 
has already received service orders for 60 satellites up to the 
year 2000, totalling some $1 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Wei-ming (7115 1792 0682): "Deng Xiaoping </F>
Requires the Preliminary Work Committee to Do Down-to-Earth 
Work"] 
  [Text] According to sources in Beijing, on 6 December, 
Deng Xiaoping talked with personnel from the CPC Central 
Committee's General Office and the CPC Central Secretariat. 
Mentioning the Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping said: 
Britain is stirring up certain political trouble [gao xie zheng 
zhi feng bo 2269 0067 2398 3112 7364 3134] to probe our reaction 
and this is what we have long anticipated. It would be strange 
if the British did not do such things and in the remaining time, 
they will continue to do such things. Britain is unwilling to 
see the disappearance of its political and economic influence 
[shi li 0528 0500] in Hong Kong. However, the British Government 
should be aware that the Chinese Government and the Chinese 
people will not sit idly by and allow Britain to do such things. 
The timetable for recovering Hong Kong is determined by the 
Chinese Government. 
  The sources also said that Zeng Qinghong, director of the 
CPC 
Central Committee's General Office, told Deng that in two 
opinion polls in some major mainland cities, 99 percent of the 
people supported the Central Government's policy on the Hong 
Kong issue. However, some people thought that the central 
government was not tough enough toward Britain and still 
cherished unrealistic "illusions." Some people even criticized 
the central government for being "rightist" on this issue. 
Deng said: I do not think there is any rightism. We 
should give time to Britain to perform. The Preliminary Work 
Committee should now quicken its work and should work in a 
down-to-earth manner. Britain's political attempts will not 
succeed because Hong Kong belongs to China. 
  According to sources, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing 
and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu recently gave separate 
speeches on the situation in the Sino-British talks and the 
central policy on the Hong Kong issue to various central 
departments, commissions, offices, and military academies. 
Jiang Enzhu also answered questions raised by cadres in the 
Ministry of National Defense and its affiliate institutions. 
Li Lanqing said: In addition to playing political tricks, 
Britain also tried to undermine Hong Kong's economy, including 
Hong Kong's financial conditions. The central authorities were 
prepared against this in 1990. When talking with British 
Foreign Secretary Howe on 31 July 1984, Comrade Xiaoping 
expressed the hope that the British Hong Kong authorities would 
persuade British companies not to take the lead in transferring 
funds out of Hong Kong. However, if the British decided to 
withdraw their funds, we would not try to keep them from 
quitting; if they tried to reenter Hong Kong later, we would not 
hold a welcome meeting. If some people want to quit, it is 
certain that other people are willing to come. The key lies in 
China's political stability and vigorous economic development, 
with the policy toward Hong Kong remaining unchanged. Britain 
is trying to stir up trouble and undermine the Hong Kong economy 
in order to prolong its colonial rule. Britain's attempt to 
foster a pro- British and anti-China force, which attaches 
itself to foreigners, to disrupt Hong Kong's smooth transition 
and disrupt the work of the future special administrative region 
[SAR] government will not succeed. The central government has 
the ability and strength to ensure Hong Kong's long-term 
stability and development. We shall not only protect 
local-funded enterprises but also foreign-funded enterprises in 
Hong Kong and we shall create more favorable conditions for 
foreign investors. The Hong Kong stock market has been soaring 
in recent months and many foreign investments are long- or 
medium-term ones. Foreign investment in China was almost twice 
as much as that in the same period of last year. This shows 
that the troublesome events in Hong Kong only had a temporary 
impact on the situation and it was China's policies that played 
a decisive role in maintaining Hong Kong's development. Even if 
disorder occurs in Hong Kong, the unrest will not last long. 
The central government will adopt resolute measures to solve 
the problem. 
  Li Lanqing also said: In the future, China will give full 
consideration to the foreign companies and businessmen who have 
made substantial contributions to Hong Kong's economic 
development, and have sincerely cooperated with the Chinese 
Government, will be given more favorable consideration regarding 
their interests and development space in China. The Chinese 
Government acts in good faith and greatly cherishes friendship. 
  Jiang Enzhu said: When holding talks with the British 
Government on the convergence of Hong Kong's political structure 
before and after 1997, the Chinese Government did not give up 
its principles. It was the British side which deliberately 
stirred up trouble to undermine the talks but the decision of 
the Chinese Government to hold the talks was still correct. In 
the 17 rounds of talks, the British side fully laid bare its 
sinister purpose of stirring up political trouble in order to 
prolong British colonial rule or the influence of the British 
colonialist ideology. This was a good thing. 
  Jiang Enzhu added: Because Britain violated the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration, the Joint Declaration has lost its function 
and value. Britain went as far as to flagrantly negate the 
existence of the agreements reached by the Chinese and British 
Governments. This is rarely seen in international relations. 
The statements and agreements between the two countries and 
between the two governments must be jointly observed and 
implemented by the two sides. If one side seriously violates 
the agreement and insists on continuing such violation, or even 
negates the existence of such statements and agreements, then 
the statements and agreements will lose their binding force on 
the other side. 
  Jiang also said: On the Hong Kong issue, Britain even 
interfered in China's internal affairs and challenged China's 
sovereign power. It was natural that Britain's practice was 
rejected by the Chinese Government. 
  Jiang said: The central government still does not endorse 
the demand of some localities, departments, institutions, and 
schools to stage demonstrations in front of the British Embassy 
and consulates. Such a form of expression is not suited to our 
country's current political environment but this idea cannot be 
regarded as a wrong one. 
  Reportedly, since early December, more than 40 institutions, 
schools, and organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, 
Chongqing, and Guangzhou have applied to stage demonstrations to 
protest against Britain's behavior in trampling upon the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration but their applications were not 
approved by the authorities.

<F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Guo Lingchun (6753 3781 </F>
2504): "Hong Kong 1993: Full of Confidence and Expectations"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 3 Jan (XINHUA) -- Sino-British relations 
reached a low ebb in 1993 due to disputes over the issue of Hong 
Kong's political system. Although people in Hong Kong had some 
worries and anxieties, various signs showed the world: It was a 
year with more expectations and confidence than anytime before. 
  On 10 December 1993, the Hong Kong Government, in disregard 
of the will of Hong Kong residents and the opposition of the 
Chinese side, gazetted parts of the "political reform bill." A 
dark cloud overshadowed Hong Kong, and people made forecasts on 
whether the next day's weather would be cloudy or fine. It was 
on the next day, that Hong Kong's economic lifeline, namely its 
stock market, ushered in an historical moment -- the stock 
market index broke 10,000 points. The United Stock Exchange was 
a happy place; directors of the board and brokers opened 
champagne to celebrate this long awaited day. 
  In analyzing the stock market trends, professionals noted 
that despite the noncooperative attitude of the British side in 
the transitional period, the Chinese Government's pledge to 
firmly maintain and guarantee Hong Kong's long-term stability 
and prosperity enabled the people to have a far-sighted view. 
Foreign investors also expressed their satisfaction over Hong 
Kong's investment environment with China's support. 
  The booming stock market was just one example. A few days 
later, a large real estate transaction took place in Hong Kong. 
A consortium composed of five companies in Hong Kong purchased 
a residential area in Bijiashan's Longpingdao at the 
unprecedented price of HK$3.94 billion. Real estate experts 
marveled at the transaction and commented: "In the wake of the 
rupture of the 17th round of Sino-British talks, the developers 
apparently continue to think Hong Kong's real estate market has 
good prospects in the future." A responsible person of the 
consortium said with a smile: "Personally, I am full of 
confidence in Hong Kong's real estate market after 1997." 
  Let us recall some transactions of Hong Kong's expensive 
property and land in 1993. During the year, 27 real estate 
transactions each exceeding HK$500 million were purchased by 
local consortiums. It can be said real estate "led the market." 
Although most experts believe Hong Kong's housing market has a 
slight chance of rising in the next few years, the immediate 
competition shows that real estate moguls see a bright future 
for the market. 
  Not all people are without worries, some are silently 
adopting a wait-and-see attitude. However, the closer to 1997 
the more Hong Kong residents are awaiting "one country, two 
systems," "administering Hong Kong by residents in Hong Kong," 
and the policy of "no change for 50 years." All kinds of 
erroneous reports and rumors cannot obstruct people's optimistic 
expectations for the future. The Chinese Hong Kong Economic and 
Trade Association, which was established at the end of 1993, 
named its first activity as "Successfully Marching Toward the 
Year 2000." The director of the association publicly announced: 
We are convinced that "one country, two systems" will be firmly 
implemented in Hong Kong in 1997. 
  During 1993, education to popularize the Hong Kong Basic Law 
became a social custom. Several dozen civil units have 
organized joint meetings to systematically promote various 
activities. More and more people in Hong Kong are learning 
about their rights and obligations. The Preliminary Working 
Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [HKSAR], which shows the "image" of the 
HKSAR government, has been accepted by more residents in Hong 
Kong. Cheng Jienan, secretary general of the influential civil 
political organization, "The Association of Democratic 
Construction," commented on a public opinion poll and said: 
People in Hong Kong have gradually understood that the Chinese 
Government has the need and capability to make preparations for 
the transition in 1997. 
  From people's signed letters to the Secretariat of the 
Preliminary Working Committee and from constant telephone calls 
received by XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, we know the innermost 
thoughts and feelings of people who are concerned about their 
own fate. They put forward plans for administering Hong Kong in 
the future, suggested things to which good attention should be 
paid in the course of "recovery," and expressed other views. 
This indicated that a brand new attitude of being the masters 
of the country is brewing in this land, on which the 100-year 
colonial rule will soon end. 
  The heat of emigration which once engulfed Hong Kong has 
begun to cool down, and "the return of talented people" has 
become a new custom. Some say this means "tired birds know it 
is time to return" and some say it is due to the economic 
recession in Europe and America. However, according to the view 
of a scholar of the Hong Kong Personnel Management Association, 
the good, bright prospects of Hong Kong's economy have provided 
a golden opportunity for those who have returned to use their 
skills. According to a statistical report, of the Hong Kong 
residents who went abroad to settle down in foreign countries in 
the past 10 years, some 12 percent have returned to their 
homeland. The number will continue to rise this year. 
  It is estimated that Hong Kong's economic growth in 1993 was 
five percent. In reviewing the past and looking toward the 
future, authoritative people in various trades all mentioned the 
"powerful push of the Chinese factor." People in trade circles 
have made encouraging remarks in the past few days to say 
goodbye to the old year and greet the New Year: With the 
accumulation of foundation work over many years plus the support 
of the vigorously developing economy on the mainland, Hong 
Kong's future prospects are very bright! 
  In 1993, people focused their attention on the development 
of 
Sino-British relations and its influence. The unilateral ending 
of talks by the British side cannot prevent the pace of Hong 
Kong's return, but has made hesitaters give up their illusions. 
Therefore, people in Hong Kong are more confident and have more 
expectations than ever before. A businessman said: "We are 
convinced that China's policy for Hong Kong is a mature and 
stable one."

1229): "Dissolving the Three-Tiered Structure Is Inevitable for 
China To Reexercise Its Sovereignty Over Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- For the sake of Hong 
Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and its smooth 
transition, the Chinese Government has held talks with Britain 
for as long as seven months on the 1994-95 elections in Hong 
Kong. After the talks broke down as a result of side issues 
that Britain created, Chris Patten brazenly submitted to the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] his "political reform 
bill," which goes against the three principles [adherence to the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, convergence with the Basic Law 
of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), 
and the observance of the agreements and understanding reached 
by China and Britain]. According to the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, Britain's administration in Hong 
Kong will end on 30 June 1997, the political framework of the 
British Hong Kong Government will also terminate at that time, 
and the three-tiered frameworks created in the 1994-95 elections 
will also be dissolved. This is inevitable for China to 
reexercise its sovereignty over Hong Kong and bring the British 
rule there to an end, and it will be an important step that 
China will take to execute the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law and to carry out the "one country, two 
systems" principle. 
  Hong Kong's three-tiered political structure made up by its 
district boards and two municipal councils as well as by the 
Legco is a major issue relevant to Hong Kong's smooth transition 
in 1997. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, during 
Hong Kong's latter transitional period, all measures taken to 
ensure its smooth transition in 1997 should be examined and 
discussed by China and Britain. However, refusing to consult 
China on this major issue, Britain incessantly schemed to "make 
transitional arrangements on its own" in an attempt to keep 
China out from participating in transitional affairs. This move 
itself has violated the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law. If Hong Kong's three- tiered framework should end on 
30 June 1997, China cannot be totally uninvolved with the issue; 
but because there is the issue of the transition of members of 
the three-tiered council to the post-1997 period, China and 
Britain have held 17 rounds of talks on the 1994- 95 elections 
in Hong Kong. Now that Britain has undermined the talks and 
there is no through train to speak off, the three-tiered 
framework has to be overturned and rebuilt. This is to say that 
the three-tiered framework of the British Hong Kong Government 
will end on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will 
rebuild the political framework of the HKSAR in accordance with 
the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National 
People's Congress on 1 July 1997. 
  The British side has been hoping that by forming a group 
during the 1994-95 election, the new HKSAR Government in 1997 
would have no other choice but to swallow the bitter fruit 
created by Britain so that people acceptable to Britain can 
continue to control the future HKSAR Government and Legco, and 
Britain's ruling power can continue in Hong Kong. Now they are 
infuriated, knowing that their wishful thinking is just an 
illusion. So they have counterattacked, claiming that "the 
Basic Law will be violated if the tenure of the three-tiered 
council members cannot straddle 1997," and that "China has 
expanded the kitchen" and "threatened members of the 
three-tiered council." But like the proverbial donkey in 
ancient Guizhou, it has exhausted its tricks. The outcome has 
gone against its wishes, the life of colonialism will soon end, 
and Britain will eventually gain nothing in this respect. 
  When Britain's ruling power in Hong Kong terminates on 30 
June 1997, all the political structures of the British Hong Kong 
Government there, including the Legco, the district boards, and 
the municipal councils, will have to wither away on their own on 
1 July 1997. Britain will have no right whatsoever to meddle in 
our business and make unilateral arrangements for Hong Kong's 
political structure after 1997. 
  The Basic Law has embodied the sovereignty which China will 
reexercise over Hong Kong, and when China does what has been 
prescribed in the Basic Law, it simply is not "expanding the 
kitchen" as certain people have clamored in saying. As for the 
claim that China has "threatened members of the three-tiered 
council," that is even more absurd. Even if China and Britain 
have reached an agreement through consultations, whether members 
of the Hong Kong Legco can go on to become Legco members of the 
HKSAR after 1997 will still have to be confirmed by the 
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. Because Britain has 
refused to cooperate with China and has acted on its own, it is 
totally justified that the three- tiered structure and the term 
of the council members must be discontinued after 1997. 
  We must say that because the Basic Law embodies and codifies 
the "one country, two systems" principle into law, abolishing 
all laws which contravene the Basic Law and all organs created 
by these laws is an act which firmly safeguards the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law as well as the principles 
governing "one country, two systems," "the administration of 
Hong Kong by Hong Kong people," and the "high degree of 
autonomy." Any mudslinging, attack, rumormongering, or 
distortion cannot stop the Britain's colonial rule from 
collapsing and the political doom of the pro-British and 
anti-China elements. 
  "One thousand sails are passing by the sunken ship, and 
10,000 trees are sprouting in front of the sick wood." The day 
when China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong will be 
the time when the principle of "one country, two systems" will 
be formally carried out. One important requirement is that we 
must make genuine efforts to safeguard China's national 
sovereignty and territorial integrity so that this principle can 
be implemented in Hong Kong. This is a responsibility that 
cannot be shirked by any Chinese countrymen. Acting as the 
masters of their own country, all Hong Kong citizens who are 
patriotic and who love Hong Kong will be concerned with Hong 
Kong's smooth transition, they will actively participate in all 
preparations for the transfer of political power in 1997, and, 
with a new spiritual outlook, they will also greet the day when 
China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong.

  [Text] Civil service union leaders say the government 
should not ban them from liaising with the working panel to 
prepare for Hong Kong's transition, although they had 
reservations about sitting on the China-appointed body. The 
comments came after the government issued a directive asking 
them to turn down invitations from the Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC) for the Special Administrative Region [SAR] 
Preparatory Committee to discuss transitional matters. 
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' 
Association, Peter Wong Hyo, said it was imperative for them to 
discuss transitional matters with PWC members, particularly for 
the civil service. "I think the government should not be too 
sensitive on this. It is absurd that we should seek approval 
from our supervisors before meeting the PWC members," he said. 
  Despite his strong advocation of having contacts with the 
PWC, Mr Wong said the unfriendly political climate made it 
difficult for them to sit on the panel, as suggested by a PWC 
member Vincent Lo Hong-sui. "I think it is embarrassing for us 
to sit on the panel. But we hope the PWC members will take our 
opinions into consideration," Mr Wong said. 
  The chairman of the Local Inspectors' Association Robert 
Chau 
Chuen-kung, said he did not see any problems with them having 
contact with the PWC. "I personally find nothing wrong for us 
to be consulted by the PWC, as long as we act according to the 
Official Secrets Act," he said. "But since the Government has 
issued the directive, we must abide by it or risk our job 
prospects." 
  Although Mr Chau said civil servants could refrain from 
sitting on the PWC, which was a consultative body, he called on 
the government to let them join the SAR Preparatory Committee to 
be set up in 1996 to finalise details of the post-1997 
government. "We are talking about convergence, which is very 
important to Hong Kong and cannot be done within a matter of 24 
hours. We need to prepare for it" he said. 
  His concern was shared by the chairman of the 15,000-strong 
Government Employees' Association Cheng Chung-wai, who feared 
that civil servants would be discriminated against by the 
Government if they established close links with the PWC. "The 
participation of civil servants will be of great help to the 
PWC's work and, in turn, will benefit the smooth transition of 
Hong Kong," he said. Mr Cheng said about 90 percent of civil 
servants would stay in Hong Kong after 1997 and there was an 
urgent need to get their views and concerns through to the 
Beijing Government. 
  The deputy chairman of the Association for Expatriate Civil 
Servants (AECS) Barry Brown, said the group would work according 
to the decision of the senior Civil Service Council. It might 
not be appropriate for civil servants to become members of the 
PWC, but they should give their opinions on the transition to 
their members. Mr Brown said the AECS was particularly concerned 
about the definition of locals and whether they would be allowed 
to serve Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Article 99 of the Basic Law stipulates that public servants 
be permanent residents of Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, December 30 (XINHUA) -- Overseas 
companies had set up 624 Asia-Pacific regional headquarters and 
844 regional offices here in Hong Kong as of June 1 this year, 
according to the latest survey by the Industry Department. 
  The survey, which was published here today, shows that the 
United States had the largest number of regional headquarters in 
the territory with 182 companies, followed by Japan (88) and the 
United Kingdom (81). 
  The major business of the regional headquarters included 
wholesale, retail, and import and export activities, transport 
and related services, manufacturing and finance and banking. 
  As regards regional offices, the survey showed that Japan 
had 
the largest number with a total of 185, followed by the United 
States (183), the United Kingdom (102), China (42) and 
Switzerland (38). 
  Trading was the most common economic activity pursued by 
regional offices in Hong Kong, followed by finance and banking, 
and manufacturing. 
  The survey showed that 94 percent of the respondents 
considered Hong Kong's banking and financial facilities as the 
most important and the most favorable factor for the regional 
operations. 
  About 80 percent of the respondents considered that, 
compared 
with the year before, the overall favorability of Hong Kong as a 
regional headquarters or regional office had improved or had 
remained satisfactory. 
  The value of overseas investment in Hong Kong's 
manufacturing 
industries at the end of 1992 totalled 37.3 billion HK dollars 
(4.78 billion U.S. dollars), according to the latest figures 
from the Industry Department. 
  Japan continued to be the leading source of overseas 
investment in the manufacturing sectors, followed by the United 
States and China, the department said.

  [Text] Macao, December 31 (XINHUA) -- A high-ranking 
Chinese official said here today that China and Portugal have 
cooperated effectively in implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Declaration and for the smooth transition in Macao. 
  Ambassador Guo Jiading, leader of the Chinese team of Sino- 
Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, made these remarks at a news 
conference here this afternoon. 
  Guo said that in 1993 Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice- 
President Rong Yiren and other senior officials had paid 
official visit to Portugal and Portuguese foreign minister and 
several other governmental officials had also visited China. 
  He said he was convinced that the high-level contacts 
between 
the two governments would further promote the consolidation and 
development of the Sino-Portuguese friendly relations of 
cooperation and enhance Macao residents' confidence on 
Sino-Portuguese cooperation in guaranteeing long-term stability 
in the territory. 
  Guo said that in 1993 both sides of the Sino-Portuguese 
Joint 
Liaison Group had initially consulted with each other and made 
marked achievements in handling affairs in the transitional 
period of Macao by observing the Joint Declaration and on the 
basis of mutual respect and mutual understanding. 
  In addition to the three major questions in the transitional 
period, namely the localization of public servants and law and 
officialization of Chinese language, and question about Macao's 
entry in international organizations, the two sides of the Joint 
Liaison Group also exchanged views on retirement pay for public 
servants, participation of Bank of China in note-issuing in 
Macao and others, Guo said. 
  He pointed out that the three questions are the major 
factors 
which have significant influence on the overall situation of the 
transitional period, saying that China has and will extend more 
efforts in pushing forward the settlement of the three major 
questions and others concerned.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] A few days ago, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, went to the Wangfujing Department 
Store (Group) Company Limited to conduct investigation and 
study. He also heard Wangfujing Department Store and Xidan 
Shopping Center's reports on 1993 work and 1994 work 
arrangements, urged these two enterprises to make development in 
accordance with the systems of modern commercial enterprises and 
large groups and to bring into full play their role as the 
political core of the party. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong affirmed the work achievements of these two 
enterprises, set forth three tasks, and also asked to fulfill 
the tasks in 1994. 
  First, put development in line with the modern commercial 
enterprise system. According to the guidelines of the central 
authorities, we should set up a modern enterprise system with 
commercial characteristics and particularly create experiences 
in developing holding companies. Our shareholding enterprises 
should have Chinese characteristics, proceed from reality, free 
themselves from both modern and traditional restrictions, have 
the leadership of the party, have their stocks controlled by the 
state, and ensure to abide by the state laws, principles, and 
policies. We should know that there must be two possibilities 
in carrying out the shareholding system on a trial basis since 
the system is impossibly perfect. So, we should strive to gain 
advantages and avoid disadvantages. 
  Second, develop toward the orientation of large groups. Each 
of Wangfujing Department Store and Xidan Shopping Center creates 
more than 1 billion yuan of marketing volume. However, they are 
still small groups. They should strive to be large groups. For 
instance, they should specifically define the amounts of 
property, the number of overseas enterprises, and the number of 
branches. They should have the daring to be socialist enterprise 
owners. Instead of staying at and moving around the original 
place, we should go out of the municipality and the national 
border to make development. We must neither accomplish in one 
mover nor develop slowly. We should make bigger strides and 
make bigger development. 
  Third, bring into full play the role as the party's 
political core. Shareholding enterprises are not different from 
the original enterprises. How can they bring into play the 
functions of the party? The department store has some 
experiences in this regard. So, we should further develop these 
experiences and strive to form systems. The party committees 
should supervise and guarantee the socialist orientation of 
enterprises. This function must neither be weakened nor shaken, 
but should be strengthened. If this function is shaken, we will 
not be able to develop the socialist market economy. The 
enterprise party committees and branches should strive to make 
explorations and create experiences in the course of deepening 
reform. 
  After the forum, Chen Xitong zestfully inspected the newly 
reconstructed goods yard of the department store; also cordially 
talked with the salesclerks; and asked them about the marketing, 
contract, payment, and living situation. 
  Also joining the investigation and study activities were 
Ouyang Wenan and Duan Bingren, standing committee members of the 
municipal party committee; Meng Xuenong, vice mayor of the 
municipality; and responsible persons of the municipal 
departments concerned.

  [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- Beijing's retail 
value of consumer goods last year totalled 54.5 billion yuan 
(over six billion U.S. dollars), up 27 percent over the previous 
year. 
  This year was the tenth consecutive year that the capital 
maintained a double-digit increase rate in the total retail 
value of consumer goods. 
  In the past year 11 department stores and shopping centers 
in 
the city joined the list of big-name companies with sales 
volumes exceeding 100 million yuan-worth. The total number of 
such undertakings rose from less than half a dozen only a few 
years ago to 26 by the end of last year. 
  According to a survey, the combined sales volume of 120 
major 
companies (0.08 percent of the total number of enterprises in 
Beijing) in the sectors of general merchandise, electrical 
appliances, cultural goods, clothing and foodstuffs made up for 
20 percent of the city's total last year. 
  Experts attributed the surge in sales volume to the reform 
measures coupled with the drive for the establishment of a 
market economy as well as to robust purchasing power and an 
ample supply of goods. 
  Major reform measures put into effect by the Beijing 
municipality last year ranged from lifting price controls on 
grain and edible oil to introducing the share-holding system to 
more companies. As a result, over 6,000 small firms expanded 
their business last year. 
  They said such reforms have ended the monopoly of 
state-owned 
enterprises in the retail sector. Collective, individual, 
private and joint ventures are playing increasingly important 
roles and have helped to turn Beijing into the largest commodity 
distribution center in north China. 
  The sales volume of the city's non-state-owned commercial 
enterprises last year accounted for 61 percent of the total 
figure.

  [Text] Hohhot, January 4 (XINHUA) -- The landlocked Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China further expanded its 
access to the outside world in 1993 and achieved greater 
progress in its border trade and tourism. 
  Eighteen open border posts have been set up along its 
4,200-km border line. Last year, some 470,000 Chinese and 
foreign business people went through these posts as well as 2.07 
million tons of cargo, up by a third than in 1992. 
  By now, the region has established an extensive transport 
network of railways, highways, water routes and airlines. 
  The Hulun Buir league in the north of the region, which is 
famous for its flourishing border trade, has set up seven 
trading posts along its 1,700-km-long border line with Mongolia 
and Russia. 
  To date, the league has established stable trade relations 
with more than 1,000 firms from 22 countries and regions, such 
as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Mongolia, the 
United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea. 
  Besides, the league has opened 12 tourist routes leading to 
the vicinity. In 1993, the volume of barter trade between 
Chinese, Russian and Mongolian tourists stood at 20 million yuan 
(3.4 million U.S. dollars) and one billion rubles (8 million 
U.S. dollars), respectively. 
  Manzhouli has always been called the "bridge of Eurasia" for 
its large trade handling volume. Since the city was approved by 
the government to be an open outlet in 1992, it has become 
China's largest border trade city, which has multiple functions, 
including exporting, processing, financial trade, international 
transport and storage. 
  Erenhot, another renowned border city, also launched 
large-scale construction projects last year. As more new roads, 
trade centers and storehouses are being built, the city is 
developing into a new grassland border trade center. 
  To make it possible to do business all the year round, a 
bridge is expected to be built across the Erhkuna river along 
the Sino- Russian border. 
  Meanwhile, air traffic is expanding. In addition to the 
weekly flight between Hohhot and Ulaanbaatar, capital of 
Mongolia, a through-flight between Hohhot and Hong Kong is to 
open to traffic before long. The region's second airport, 
Hailar airport, is to operate soon.

<F P=106> [Article by staff commentator Chang Shaoyang (1603 1421 </F>
2254): "It Is Necessary To Say `Two Things' to Foreign 
Businessmen"] 
  [Text] When the great fire at the Shenzhen Zhili Technical 
Toy Factory -- which had a death toll of 80 -- had just died 
down, with nothing said about how its Hong Kong boss -- who is 
nowhere to be found -- would be dealt with, two Taiwan-funded 
enterprises in Fuzhou have become the new focuses of concern in 
public opinion. In the first incident, a female worker at the 
Yongqi Company was shut in a dog kennel, and the Taiwanese 
manager -- who is held to be chiefly responsible -- has 
absconded, following in the footsteps of the aforementioned Hong 
Kong boss. Then, on 13 December, a fire broke out at Gaofu 
Textile Company, Ltd., causing the deaths of some 60 workers. 
  True, there is an inevitable, accidental factor in any fire, 
but for some time past, there really has been a small number of 
foreign businessmen who pay no attention to Chinese laws and 
decrees, being bent on making profits by playing wicked tricks 
against their conscience: Some had no concern for the life and 
safety of Chinese staffers and workers, and would not provide 
labor conditions meeting safety and hygiene requirements. 
Others did not show any respect for the human dignity of 
Chinese staffers and workers, and would arbitrarily beat them, 
call them names, conduct body searches, and restrict their 
personal freedom. Some regarded Chinese staffers and workers 
merely as cheap machines that create wealth, while allowing them 
very low pay, and depriving them of legitimate public holidays, 
as well as their right to leave with pay. Still others deprived 
Chinese staffers and workers of their rights and interests in 
organizing workers' trade unions, regardless of customary 
international practice and the stipulations of Chinese law. In 
certain foreign-funded enterprises, their awful demeanor has 
gone beyond the tolerance of the law of any sovereign state. 
  It must be pointed out that the lawbreaking behavior of some 
foreign businessmen had its cause in their ignorance of Chinese 
law, not in deliberate actions. However, there really are some 
individual foreign businessmen who definitely believe that 
mainland China is "a paradise for adventurists," where they run 
no risk, and they can keep the enterprise's running costs to a 
minimum impossible to achieve abroad or outside the border, and 
can reduce China's legal system to nothingness, as described in 
a poetic line: "It looks like grass from afar, but is actually 
nothing when one comes draws close." 
  How is it possible that those foreign businessmen have such 
an understanding of mainland China? Who has led them into this 
"erroneous zone?" Perhaps it would be no exaggeration to say 
that "the cause lies in our own selves!" 
  One wave of the "craze for importing foreign funds" has 
surged higher than another in various places over the past few 
years. The volume of foreign funds imported, and the number of 
foreign-funded enterprises sanctioned seemed to be the highest 
criterion for assessing the governing accomplishments of "local 
officials" at all levels. There is always a limit to foreign 
funds, but not in the demand for them. Thus, all places were 
vying to present their preferential policies. As for foreign 
businessmen, their tax burdens have been cut time and again, and 
land prices were cut increasingly deeper as local officials 
bowed increasingly lower before foreign businessmen. Naturally, 
foreign businessmen heard only a crescendo chorus of "welcome" 
wherever they went; how could there be any "different opinion?" 
Could there be places or people that would run the risk of 
dampening the enthusiasm of investment- bent foreign businessmen 
by enlightening them on the ABC's of the Chinese law? 
  "The habitual force of people going after profits is like 
water in a river always running downstream." Foreign 
businessmen come to China to invest in running enterprises so as 
to make money; this is beyond reproach. To provide them with a 
sound investment climate and play the role of host is something 
that must be done. However, there is a "limit" to everything; 
we must remember that "excess is just as bad as deficiency," 
which has been a law that governing things since ancient times. 
Quite a few foreign businessmen have been scared away by the 
"wild" super-preferential policies of some localities. 
Regarding those places where vicious incidents frequently took 
place, those earnest, law-abiding foreign businessmen who make 
money by relying on their own abilities would ponder: Can one 
be at ease in a legal environment that cannot even protect the 
personal rights, interests, properties, and lives of its own 
citizens, its own brothers and sisters? 
  Locking one's doors against the world is not socialism; 
neither is being afraid of foreign countries or fawning on 
foreign powers; nor is impoverishment or neglecting and even 
sacrificing the legitimate rights and interests of one's own 
compatriots in order to escape poverty and become well-off. In 
socialist China, no patriotic Chinese who has intuitive 
knowledge will ever tolerate a repetition of the tragic 
"indentured laborers"; by no means will he tolerate the evil of 
putting an equal sign between "Chinese and dogs" on PRC 
territory! 
  To those foreign businessmen who plan to invest in China in 
sincere cooperation, our door is wide open and will always be, 
but we must tell them two things: First, we warmly welcome them 
and will provide them with conveniences. Second, they must 
observe Chinese laws, decrees and regulations, and must operate 
in accordance with the law. Chinese laws are suitable to all, 
without discrimination, regardless of surname, no matter whether 
capitalist or socialist, Chinese or foreign. Those who abide by 
the law will be protected, while lawbreakers will be penalized. 
Soverignty and the law brook no nonsense. 
  The "welcoming ceremonies" are complete only when these "two 
things" have been made clear. Of course, we must be true to our 
word. The Hong Kong boss of the Zhili factory, and the Taiwan 
manager of the Yongqi Company have left without saying goodbye, 
believing that "the show is over" when they are "gone with the 
wind," though on this point they are wrong. 
  In conclusion, we would like to say a few words to those 
brothers and sisters "working" at foreign-funded enterprises: 
True, we are poor today, but in seeking jobs, we should choose 
a sound employer, while avoiding those places where we will have 
to suffer and be humiliated, or even sacrifice our lives in 
order to earn a living. In addition, we must be always serious 
on one point: Should our legitimate rights and interests be 
violated, we should learn to "protect ourselves" with the law. 
Never should we forget that no matter the kind of enterprise at 
which we work, we are the masters on this piece of land.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and </F>
economic cooperation, by an unidentified correspondent on 29 
December; place not given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- [Correspondent] 
The People's Bank of China has announced Beijing will begin 
major reform of the foreign exchange structure. What impact 
will this reform have on the development of China's foreign 
trade? 
  [Wu Yi] In line with the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the state will mainly 
apply such economic means as exchange rates, taxation, and 
credit to regulate economic activities with foreign countries. 
Exchange rates -- an economic lever -- are playing an 
increasingly important role in regulating our country's foreign 
trade. The State Council's decision to further reform our 
country's foreign exchange control system beginning next year is 
very important. Because it is crucial to the deepening of 
reform of the foreign trade structure, such reform will have a 
major, positive, and far-reaching impact on the development of 
foreign trade in our country. In line with the overall plan for 
reform of the foreign exchange control system next year, we will 
eliminate the double-track exchange rate system; introduce a 
unitary market-based manageable floating exchange rate system; 
introduce a system under which foreign exchange settlements and 
selling of foreign exchange are conducted by the banks; and 
abolish the system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange 
while delivering the rest to the state. This is of tremendous 
significance to further reforming the foreign trade structure. 
In my opinion, all these reforms will create a good environment 
for fair competition by all types of export enterprises, will 
greatly speed up transformation of the operating mechanism of 
foreign trade enterprises, and will allow foreign exchange rates 
to play their function more effectively in regulating foreign 
trade, thus playing a very important role in expanding the 
import-export trade. Reform will bring our country's foreign 
exchange and foreign trade structures closer to the requirements 
of a socialist market economy; is conducive to establishing an 
operating mechanism suited to the rules and customs common in 
international economic activities; and will play a positive role 
in restoring our country as a signatory to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  It can be said that deepening reform of the foreign exchange 
control system, and establishing a new foreign exchange 
mechanism in which the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure is being accelerated and in which opening up 
to the outside world is being further widened, have created a 
hard-to-achieve opportunity for China to expand its foreign 
trade. We must have a firm grasp of the situation, seize the 
opportunity, strive to expand our foreign trade in 1994, and 
undertake foreign economic and trade work in a better manner. 
  [Correspondent] How can foreign exchange needed by 
import enterprises for regular use be guaranteed after the 
system of foreign exchange conversion is introduced and after 
the system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange is 
abolished? 
  [Wu Yi] Some are concerned whether export enterprises will 
be ensured of the foreign exchange they need for their regular 
use following the introduction of the foreign exchange 
conversion system and the abolishment of the system for 
retaining a portion of foreign exchange. In fact, such concern 
is unnecessary because, first, the system of examination and 
approval for the use of foreign exchange will be abolished on 
the basis of the system for foreign exchange conversion and of 
the system for selling of foreign exchange by banks under which 
the renminbi is convertible on a conditional basis. Any 
enterprise wishing to use foreign exchange may use a valid 
certificate to convert renminbi for foreign exchange, provided 
its operation meets the requirements of the state industrial 
policy. This makes it easy for all types of enterprises to 
operate their business. Second, as a transitional measure to 
ensure foreign exchange for export enterprises, it may set up a 
counter account at the designated foreign exchange bank with 
renminbi equal to 50 percent of the total amount of foreign 
exchange it needs. The bank will guarantee the supply of 
foreign exchange to the enterprise, within the limit of the 
counter account, for its needs in expanding export trade, such 
as the import of materials for processing, packing materials, 
export base expenses, settlement of claims, freight charges and 
insurance, after-sales services, and subsidiary expenses. The 
export enterprise can still buy additional foreign exchange at 
the designated foreign exchange bank by showing valid 
certificates, to meet needs which the balance of the counter 
account is insufficient to cover. So, the normal needs of 
export enterprises in foreign exchange are reliably guaranteed. 
  Of course, problems may happen during the shift from the old 
to the new system. We should further deepen reform, formulate 
concrete operational procedures, and promptly solve any problems. 
  [Correspondent] How will the reform of the foreign 
exchange management system affect the foreign exchange currently 
retained in the hands of export enterprises? To put it more 
clearly, will the enterprises be allowed to continue to use 
it? 
  [Wu Yi] All export enterprises are concerned about this 
question since it involves their vital interests. Here I can 
unequivocally tell everyone that the current reform of the 
foreign exchange management system has taken the interests of 
enterprises into full consideration. First, enterprises are 
permitted to keep and continue to use their current retained 
foreign exchange accounts and their current foreign exchange 
cash accounts. Second, enterprises are permitted to continue to 
use the balance in their retained foreign exchange accounts 
which were set up before the elimination of the double-track 
exchange rate system, and the balance shall be converted 
according to the official exchange rate of the day before the 
double-track exchange rate system was eliminated. If the 
retained portion of foreign exchange earnings has not yet been 
deposited in the account, the enterprise is required to deposit 
it within one month and is permitted to continue to use it in 
accordance with the aforesaid principle. Third, while 
enterprises are permitted to keep their foreign exchange cash 
accounts and continue to use them in making normal payments or 
sell the foreign exchange to the bank, no new deposits may be 
made to the accounts. 
  [Correspondent] How will the current reforms of the 
foreign exchange management system and the foreign trade system 
affect foreign-funded enterprises? 
  [Wu Yi] This is an important question and the answer is 
simple. 1) The way to manage foreign exchange for 
foreign-funded enterprises remains unchanged. 2) The 
elimination of the double- track exchange rate system benefits 
foreign-funded enterprises, because it resolves the 
contradiction caused by the fact that their registered capital 
is converted according to the official exchange rate, while the 
profits they remit home are converted according to market 
regulatory rate. So, the change will help attract foreign 
investors. 
  [Correspondent] After the reform, China's foreign 
exchange management will adhere to the market norm. However, it 
is reported that people in some foreign countries often take 
anti-dumping measures against our export goods on the grounds 
that our government manipulates exchange rates. Do you have any 
comments on this issue? 
  [Wu Yi] By further reforming the foreign exchange management 
system and the foreign trade system, China will manage foreign 
exchange business in accordance with market norms. At the same 
time, the unitary, well-managed floating exchange rate system 
based on market supply and demand will no doubt further enhance 
the effects of market regulation on our foreign trade activities. 
  Anti-dumping measures against our goods, which you have just 
mentioned, indeed exist abroad. In my view, as our economic 
system, including the foreign exchange management system and the 
foreign trade system, has undergone profound changes and we will 
continue to deepen reforms, the allegation of so-called exchange 
rate manipulation is groundless. We advocate promotion of 
exports in accordance with international trade norms. As a 
developing nation, we do not have the strength to dump goods 
abroad. We also oppose the practice of increasing exports by 
means of dumping. The prices of our export goods are relatively 
lower mainly because our labor is cheaper. The low prices are 
not caused by the exchange rate factor. Here I would like to 
reiterate that we oppose the practice of increasing exports by 
means of dumping, and we also oppose anyone who practices 
protectionism on the pretext of taking anti-dumping measures. 
  [Correspondent] What are the main contents of the 
reform of the foreign trade system in the next stage? 
  [Wu Yi] According to the State Council's overall plan, the 
reform of our foreign trade system in 1994 will keep abreast 
with the reforms of the finance and taxation system, the banking 
system, the investment management system, the planning system, 
and the foreign exchange management system. Major steps will be 
taken in reform. 
  In order to deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, 
we 
should firmly keep to the reform orientation of unified 
policies, open operation, fair competition, integration of 
industry and trade, promotion of the agent system, and 
enterprises assuming sole responsibility for their own profit 
and loss. The objective of reform is to build a foreign trade 
operational mechanism which conforms to the general practice of 
the international economy. 
  The main contents of the reform of the foreign trade system 
in the next stage are: 1) The state will further improve 
macroeconomic management of foreign trade, and mainly use 
economic means, such as exchange rates, taxation, and credit, in 
regulating foreign trade activities. We will reform the 
import-export management system, abolish mandatory plans, and 
reduce administrative intervention. We will control the total 
amount of a small number of commodities; manage them in 
accordance with the principle of efficiency, fairness, and 
openness; and distribute them by open tender or auction, or 
according to specific rules. We will pursue the policy and 
measures of encouraging exports, improve the export duty refund 
system, and practice a credit policy which is conducive to the 
development of foreign trade. We will establish a set of 
feasible systems for managing our enterprises abroad. We will 
accelerate foreign-trade legislation and manage foreign trade 
according to law to maintain orderly foreign trade operations. 
2) We will deepen the reform of foreign trade enterprises 
and reorganize state-owned foreign trade enterprises in 
accordance with the modern enterprise system. We will 
explore a new mode -- "large-scale economic cooperation and 
trade" characterized by the integration of trade with industry, 
agriculture, technology and commerce, as well as the integration 
of foreign trade, foreign capital, and economic cooperation. We 
will speed up the process of giving foreign trade power to 
qualified productive enterprises, scientific research 
organizations, and certain commercial and materials supply 
enterprises. 3) We will build and improve a foreign trade 
coordination service mechanism, and give full play to the 
coordination and service functions of the chambers of commerce 
for various import-export trades. 4) We will maintain the 
unity of our foreign trade policies and systems, and we will 
enhance their transparency.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Dec (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a report 
meeting series organized by the CPC Central Committee's 
Propaganda Department and other units on implementation of the 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, Yao Zhenyan, vice minister in charge of the State 
Planning Commission, reported on the objectives and progress of 
China's ongoing investment and financial restructuring. 
  Yao Zhenyan said: With gradual delegation of powers in fixed 
assets investments and the introduction of market mechanisms 
since China embarked on its reform and opening up programs 15 
years ago, a new structure is being developed. Investment 
units, which in the past depended heavily on state 
appropriations for investment funds, have shifted to raise their 
own funds through such means as bank loans, financial 
allocations, and utilization of foreign funds. The role of main 
investor -- primarily played by the central government in the 
past -- has been taken over by local governments in cooperation 
with the central government, by state-owned enterprises, by 
collective enterprises, by individuals, and by foreign firms. 
The format of investment has been shifted from near exclusive 
government investment in the past to joint investment between 
the central and the local governments, between local 
governments, between governments and enterprises, and between 
enterprises; as well as to Sino-foreign joint ventures and 
cooperation. The format for expanding reproduction has changed; 
rather than relying heavily on new projects and items as in the 
past, equal emphasis is being laid simultaneously on technical 
transformation of existing enterprises to broaden their internal 
reproduction. Administrative assignment of constructing 
investment projects has given way to tender and bidding. 
  In meeting the requirements of the 14th CPC National 
Congress 
on the establishment of a socialist market economic system, Yao 
Zhenyan maintained that, obviously, the current investment and 
financial system is still rather incompatible for facilitating 
markets to truly play the fundamental role in disposing of 
resources under state macroeconomic control. Judging from the 
actual situation prevailing in the current investment field, 
problems do exist prominently in the following three aspects. 
First, the scale of investment is overextended, as reflected 
mainly in excessive investments. Second, the structure of 
investment is irrational; and a large amount of funds are being 
diverted to low-level, low- efficiency overlapping construction 
or blind development of real estates or development zones, 
leaving little for bottleneck departments and key construction 
projects. Third, low investment efficiency, huge amounts of 
waste, unregulated fund-raising, and indiscriminate borrowing 
have worsened the irrational disposal of resources, raised 
investment costs, and lowered the macro efficiency of investment. 
  To fundamentally resolve problems existing in the investment 
and financial field, we must start with reform and establish an 
investment and financial system compatible with a socialist 
market economy. The overall objective of restructuring is to 
reform the investment and financial format by fully bringing out 
the market's regulatory role in investment and financial 
activities; to establish a mechanism aimed at reducing the 
investment risks of enterprises who, as main investors, have to 
make their own decisions and face risks; to perfect the indirect 
regulatory system on aggregate investments and structure 
compatible with a socialist market economic system so that 
timely and effective regulation and control can be effected; and 
to establish an investment-related service system and essential 
factors markets to ensure fair competition under relevant laws 
and regulations. 
  Yao Zhenyao said: In the near future, reforms covering the 
following six aspects will be carried out actively but prudently 
and will gradually be implemented: 
  -- On the basis of efficiency, market demands, and the 
nature 
of investment and financial activities, construction projects 
will be classified into competitive, infrastructure, and public 
welfare project investments. A new financing format will be 
formulated, under which enterprises will become main players in 
competitive project investment with the market as their main 
source of financing; infrastructure project investment will be 
invested and financed by the central government, with increased 
participation from local governments and enterprises; and 
governments will be primarily responsible for investment in 
public welfare projects. 
  -- We will establish mechanisms aimed at reducing 
investment risks, and change the methods for deciding on and the 
procedures for examining and approving projects. A legal person 
is essential before a project is decided upon. In order to 
expand the decisionmaking powers of legal persons, they may 
conduct feasibility studies and work out tentative plans for 
competitive investment projects meeting the requirements of the 
state industrial policy. 
  -- As far as macro regulation and control over investments 
are concerned, the central government will work out unified 
regulatory and control policies and objectives to be carried out 
by both the central and provincial governments. Provincial 
investment companies will be the main source of investment for 
local infrastructure projects. 
  -- In reforming methods for planning management, the total 
volume of investments will no longer be controlled by a set 
planned target but through the source of funds, using economic 
means for indirect regulation and control. There will be no 
targets for individual investments at the provincial, municipal, 
and autonomous levels, while the supervision of collective 
investments by local authorities will be intensified according 
to the state industrial policy and actual local conditions. 
  -- Policy lending must be separated from commercial loans. 
While projects in line with state industrial policy may get 
loans from commercial banks, it is up to the project operators 
and the banks concerned to mutually select each other and take 
their own risks; government departments can only provide 
guidance. 
  -- We will formulate a central policy on investment and 
financial system and organize the establishment of a state 
development bank.

<F P=106> [Speech by State Councillor Li Tieying at cadre meeting of </F>
the State Commission for Restructuring Economic System on 14 
October 1993: "Opportunity, Understanding, Framework, and Work"] 
  [Text] Reviewing history, whether of the international or 
domestic situation, today is conducive to China's development 
and reform, and a rare historical opportunity. It is imperative 
for us to understand and grasp actively, comprehensively, and 
correctly, Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, to seize the opportunity and accelerate 
reform as well as development. 
  The issue of development today is in essence one of reform, 
and an issue of what we should reform and how. A high growth 
rate is brought along by reform, and only through reform will it 
be possible for us to master the "high technology" of control 
over the macroeconomy in high-rate economic operation. 
  Stability can only be relative; stability cannot be 
sustained 
for long without reform and development or by seeking stability 
at the cost of reform and development; only social progress 
brought along by reform and development is the foundation of 
stability. 
  To give full play to the initiative of the central 
authorities as well as localities is the principle that we have 
adhered to for a long time, as well as summation of historical 
experiences. In the course of reform, we will not consider 
taking the initiative in one aspect, while jeopardizing it in 
the other. 
  In the present phase when reform enters the stage of 
tackling 
bottlenecks, should we overstress being gradual, sure and 
steady, we will miss the opportunity. Generally speaking, the 
basic way of pushing China's reform should be "making gradual 
progress in entirety, with phased breakthroughs." 
  From breaking up the old strucuture to building the new, 
from 
dismantling the "old house" to setting up the "new building" it 
is a process of the conversion from breaking up to setting up. 
Setting up the "new building" of the socialist market economy 
calls for meticulous design of the main pillars, and drawing the 
blueprint of the whole framework. 
<H3>  Seize the Opportunity, Accelerate Reform as Well as 
Development </H3>
  The Central Committee attaches great importance to seizing 
the opportunity, accelerating reform as well as development. In 
recent years, Comrade Xiaoping has on several occasions said: 
"It is imperative to seize the opportunity; now is a good 
opportunity. I am just worrying about losing the opportunity. 
If we fail to seize the opportunity, then the opportunity before 
us will be lost. Time waits for no one." "It seems that in our 
development, we should seize the opportunity in a certain phase 
and pursue high growth for several consecutive years." "Today 
the world is undergoing a major turning point, it is precisely 
an opportunity." His series of important remarks were made by 
standing high and viewing far, and they are his understanding of 
contemporary China as well as the world today. It is imperative 
for us to deeply understand the spiritual essence of Comrade 
Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on seizing the opportunity. The 
general spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech 
delivered at the Central Party School last year, the important 
topics at the 14th Party Congress, as well as the series of 
important meetings convoked by the Central Committee and the 
plans for reform presented, all spell seizing the opportunity, 
accelerating reform as well as development. 
  Opportunity means precisely a specific period in which the 
objective situation has provided us with the greatest number of 
advantageous factors and conditions, which are most concentrated 
at the same time. Reviewing history, deciding whether the 
international or domestic situation today is conducive to 
China's development and reform, and a rare historical 
opportunity, it is imperative for us to lose no time in pushing 
reform, accelerate conversion to the socialist market economic 
structure, accelerate development and realize the second- and 
third- step magnificent goals in realizing modernization. 
  Internationally, the world bipolar pattern has come to an 
end, and it has entered the transition period of multipolar 
development. Various forces in the international community are 
undergoing disintegration and reorganization. Major Western 
developed countries are facing many domestic problems, suffering 
from economic recession, having enough trouble even in taking 
care of themselves. There is the possibility for us to win a 
comparatively long period of peace, while working hard to make 
economic construction come up. 
  Toward the end of the 1980's, economic recession surfaced in 
major Western industrial countries with a rising unemployment 
rate, continuously shrinking saturated domestic market, and 
growing surplus capital. Such a condition has inevitably led to 
the pursuit of new international market and investment outlet. 
Statistics show that world trade volume is $7,400 billion, and 
China accounts for only 2 percent over, with very great 
potential for development. Direct capital investment of various 
countries overseas is already $2,000 billion; from now on, every 
year will see a possible rise of $300 billion. That is 
extremely helpful for China to expand opening up, utilizing 
foreign funds, and technological imports. 
  Viewing the situation at home, Comrade Xiaoping's important 
remarks made during his southern inspection tour last year 
incisively analyzed the world and domestic situation, 
scientifically summarized the basic practice and experiences of 
reform and opening up, explicitly answered many important issues 
that had perplexed and shackled people's thinking. 
Consequently, the whole party and whole people have enjoyed 
unprecedented unification in their ideological understanding. 
We have Deng Xiaoping and other proletarian revolutionaries of 
the older generation at the helm, as well as the correct 
leadership of the leadership collective of the third generation 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at this core; we enjoy political 
stability and sound social order, a high rate of economic 
growth, and the people are living and working in peace and 
contentment. Thus we possess a sound social and political 
environment for further accelerating development. 
  The 15-year reform and opening up have enabled China to 
double its economic strength, with people's living standards 
improved by a wide margin. Between 1978 and 1992, China's GNP 
increased by 2.33 times, with an average annual growth rate of 9 
percent; financial revenue increased by 2.7 times, with an 
average annual growth rate of 9.8 percent; overall popular 
consumption increased 1.48 times, with an average annual growth 
rate of 6.7 percent and 1.22 times for the non-peasant populace, 
with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent; by the end of 
last September, savings deposits of the urban and rural populace 
were 1,390 billion yuan, in addition to cash in hand and other 
financial assets in individual possession amounting to several 
hundreds of billions of yuan; the industrial setup was tending 
to become more rational, with the GNP proportion of tertiary 
industry increasing by 5 percentage points; the proportion of 
agriculture continued to drop, some 100 million people in the 
agricultural work force have been transferred to 
non-agricultural industries, with the degree of socialization in 
agricultural production further upgraded. Over the past 15 
years, we have genuinely taken the road that leads to 
modernization. The great accomplishments scored in reform and 
opening up have firmed people's determination to take the road 
of the socialist market economy, with experiences accumulating 
and large numbers of qualified people brought up. All this has 
laid down a solid foundation for accelerating economic 
development. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the national economy has 
continued to sustain the momentum of vigorous development on the 
basis of the high growth of last year. The series of measures 
of macroeconomic regulation and control that the central 
government has taken since last June are themselves a reform of 
economic administration and measures to conduct macroeconomic 
regulation and control with economic means. Marked results have 
been scored since their implementation. While applying to 
economic and legal means in the main, administrative means are 
supplemented to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control; 
this is necessary today, and also indispensable from a 
long-range view. Any country that pursues a market economy may 
conduct marcroeconomic regulation and control in various forms. 
  Some contradictions and problems have also surfaced in our 
economic life today. Basically, their cause is the coexistence 
of new and old structures, and backwardness and stagnation in 
reform of the macroscopic control structure. This being the 
case, the basic way to resolve these contradictions and problems 
is in deepening reform and quickening the pace of building the 
new socialist market economic structure. 
  Through long-term repeated fermentation, study, and 
exploration, a number of the plans for reform of the banking, 
finance and taxation, foreign trade and foreign exchange, and 
investment structures, the enterprise, social insurance, 
housing, and civil service systems, and the wage system of 
administrative organizations and institutions have already been 
presented, and more are to be presented soon. All these are 
precisely reform of a deeper tier, and serve precisely to 
basically resolve deep-tiered contradictions and problems we 
have been talking about for years. With this as a sign, 
economic restructuring in China has already entered a new phase 
characterized by comprehensiveness, acceleration, and forming 
into a whole range. To seize the opportunity means precisely 
the need of a sense of pressure to quicken the pace in reform 
and development to resolve deep-tiered contradictions and 
problems as quickly as possible. 
  Opportunity is an objective thing and will not come about 
through subjective wishful thinking. We lost several 
opportunities for great development in the 1960's and 1970's; 
consequently, our gap with developed and peripheral countries 
widened. Today, history has once again endowed the Chinese 
nation with an opportunity for great development. The 
opportunity will be lost should we procrastinate. Comrade 
Xiaoping has indicated: "By not being courageous to emancipate 
the mind and give a free hand to one's work, the consequence can 
only be the loss of opportunity, like a boat sailing against the 
stream must forge ahead or it will be driven back." Every 
comrade working in restructuring the economic system departments 
must genuinely understand and firmly grasp this rare historical 
opportunity, work hard, and live up to the mission entrusted to 
him by the times. 
<H3>  Correctly Understand and Handle Several Important Relations 
in Reform and Development </H3>
  To grasp the opportunity for deepening reform, it is 
imperative to raise our ideological level and ability to 
understand. This involves the imperative to understand and 
grasp Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics enthusiastically, comprehensively and 
correctly. Only then will it be possible to grasp the overall 
situation and orientation, learn to view things from a 
dialectical view, guard against rigidity as well as onesided 
views, while continuously make breakthroughs and progress in 
theory and practice. 
<H3>  The Issue of Emancipating the Mind and Seeking Truth From 
Facts </H3>
  Back in 1980, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "To emancipate 
the mind means precisely that one's thinking must conform with 
reality, making subjective thinking conform with the objective 
situation, and seeking truth from facts." In addition, he 
indicated: "From now on, to genuinely adhere to seeking truth 
from facts, it is imperative to emancipate the mind." 
Emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts is our party's 
persistent ideological line, and an invincible truth that has 
been testified to by practice of many years in the revolution 
and construction in China. 
  To adhere to emanciapting the mind, seeking truth from facts 
is not an empty slogan, but a principle that guides our 
practical work. 
  On the issue of development, it is precisely the need for a 
sense of pressure, a firm grasp of the opportunity to accelerate 
reform and development. All projects that have the conditions to 
be accelereated should be developed with quicker pace, and those 
projects that cannot be accelerated for the time being, should 
have conditions actively created to gradually accelerate their 
development. At the same time, it is imperative to respect the 
objective law that governs things, act according to one's 
abilities, while preventing great ups and downs in the economy 
and great losses. 
  On the issue of reform, it is precisely necessary to combine 
theory with practice. Without a ready pattern to follow in the 
exploration of building the socialist market economic structure 
in such a large country as China, we have to rely on ourselves 
in practice. It is necessary to give a free hand to and be 
courageous in practice; regarding those things that one is sure 
of, they should be boldly experimented in blazing new trail. At 
the same time, it is necessary to guard against major mistakes, 
for things one is not sure of, experiments should be allowed. 
Those which have been proved to be correct should be persisted 
in, and those which have been proved to be wrong should be 
corrected. It is necessary to respect the mass spirit of 
initiative; at the same time, it is necessasry to earnestly 
summarize experiences, and elevate successful experiences to 
theory, while making them last through laws, decrees, and 
regulations. 
  Regarding the issue of opening up, it is necessary to 
emancipate the mind to boldly absorb and refer to all fruits of 
civilization created in human society, including all advanced 
operational and managerial methods that reflect laws governing 
modern production in capitalist countries; at the same time, it 
is necessary to proceed from China's national conditions to 
embody the essential characteristics of socialism. 
  We should not study pure theoretical patterns deviating from 
China's national condition and the practice of reform and 
opening up; at the same time, we should refrain from regarding 
some structural patterns of Western market economies as a 
panacea for all diseases. China is a large country with a huge 
population, and a cultural tradition of 5,000 years; the 
development level of productive force and the market system is 
comparatively low, with a comparatively great gap between its 
urban and rural areas and an imbalance in regional development. 
China is a socialist country, which is building modernization 
as well as a socialst market economic structure. All these are 
basic Chinese national conditions. To seek truth from facts, it 
is certainly necessary to proceed from our national conditions 
and build a socialist market economic strucutre with Chinese 
characteristics. 
<H5>  The Issue of Development, Reform, and Stability </H5>
  On this issue, Comrade Xiaoping has made a series of 
important statements. 
  Comrade Xiaoping said: "Development is the final word. [fa 
zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 381]" 
"What is socialism? What is Marxism? We did not have a 
completely clear picture in our past understanding of these 
issues. Marxism places the greatest importance on developing 
productive forces. The essence of socialism is to emancipate 
and develop productive forces." Of course, the development 
Comrade Xiaoping referred to means the elevation of the 
comprehensive national strength, in both quantity and quality, 
"it does not mean encouraging an impratical high rate, but 
paying attention to economic returns as well as steady, 
harmonious development in a down-to-earth way." 
  In addition, Comrade Xiaoping indicated: "With the 
establishment of the basic socialist system, it is necessary to 
basically change the economic structure that impedes productive 
force development to promote productive force development. This 
is reform; therefore, reform also means developing productive 
forces. In the past, we only talked about developing productive 
forces under socialist conditions, saying nothing about 
emancipating productive forces through reform, and that was 
incomplete. We should talk about both emancipting and 
developing productive forces." 
  The issue of development today is precisely one of reform in 
essence and a question of what should be reformed and how. Only 
by grasping the opportunity of reform will it be possible to 
seize the opportunity of development. Without reform, 
development will not be able to get rid of the bonds of the old 
structure. Reform must aim at those deep-tiered contradictions 
that impede healthy, high econonomic growth, and reforms that 
cannot promote development are just fancy things and 
undesirable. Practice has shown that wherever a good job is 
done of reform faster development is enjoyed. Many problems 
existing in present economic life were brought about by the old 
structure. Under the situation of high growth, the old way is 
sure to bring serious trouble. High growth is brought along by 
reform, and only through reform will it be possible for us to 
master the "high technology" of control over the macroeconomy in 
a high growth rate economic operation. It is necessary for us 
to learn the skill of qickening the pace of reform under a 
situation of comparatively fast economic development and 
comparatively tense economic relations. By no means should we 
stop to pursue reform. 
  Regarding the relationship among development, reform, and 
stability, Comrade Xiaoping indicated: "Through reform, it is 
necessary to acquire conditions for long-term, sustained, and 
stable development." "Reform certainly calls for a stable 
political environment; nothing can be achieved by deviating from 
this point." 
  Stability is the prerequisite for reform and development. 
The great ups and downs in economic development, major 
mistakes, reforms surpassing the bearing capacity of society, 
enterprises and the people, and corruption will all jeopardize 
stability. However, stability can only be relative. Stability 
cannot be sustained for long without reform and development or 
seeking stability at the cost of reform and development; only 
social progress resulting from reform and development is the 
foundation of stability. Only through reform will it be 
possible to build the socialist market economic structure and 
operational mechanisms as quickly as possible, and to insure and 
promote sustained, high, and healthy economic growth. Only when 
the economy is developed with the comprehensive national 
strength augmented and people's living standards upgraded will 
it be possible to insure the long-term and basic stability of 
the country. 
<H5>  The Issue of Planning and the Market </H5>
  As for the issue of whether both planning and the market are 
economic means, and socialism can pursue a market economy as 
well, Comrade Xiaoping has made it very clear in his discussions. 
  The essence of the market economy is to achieve optimal 
allocation of production essentials through the competition 
mechanism characterized by elimination through selection and 
pursuit of maximum interest. The efficiency of the market 
economy in allocating resources has been evidenced by history. 
However, behind market efficiency are market shortcomings; 
regarding some social goals, such as fairness, public 
undertakings, and environmental protection, it is not effective 
to rely solely on the "invisible hand," namely, spontaneous 
market regulation, which has some blind spots, and can hardly 
insure the balance of economic general volume, resulting in 
periodic economic crisis. This being the case, modern Western 
countries have introduced government macroeconomic regulation 
and control and social welfare policies into the market economy 
and has greatly alleviated periodic economic crisis and class 
confrontation. Restricted by the basic system, however, they 
are unable to find a radical solution to the basic 
contradictions of capitalism. 
  Practice has proved that modern market economy with 
macroeconomic regulation and control is more efficient than the 
traditional planned economy and a market economy taking its own 
course. The socialist market economy stresses the basic role of 
the market mechanism in resource allocation; at the same time, 
it does not reject and give up the application of macroeconomic 
regulation and control as well as planning means, while doing a 
good job of applying the "visible hand." Under market economic 
conditions, the chief functions of the government are: 
Maintaining national unification and stability; conducting 
macroeconomic regulation and control; conducting resource 
allocation in non-competition arenas; and readjusting patterns 
of social distribution. 
  Presently, some patterns in macroeconomic regulation and 
control have already been shaped in Western countries, however, 
they cannot provide us with a pattern to be copied intact. The 
subject of macroeconomic regulation and control in Western 
countries is the private ownership economy, whereas the subject 
of macroeconomic regulation and control in China is mainly an 
economy with public owernship as the main body. In our 
macroeconomic regulation and control, we should pay attention to 
doing a good job of protecting productive force, especially 
promoting the structural readjustment of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, by improving their economic returns, 
development, and growth. We must proceed from China's national 
conditions, consciously explore the building of basic 
conditions, including positive, effective state macroeconomic 
regulation and control institutions and a policy system, as well 
as a whole range of national economic statistical index systems, 
and a law and decree system, avoiding the surfacing of 
disorderly phenomena in the course of developing the socialist 
market economy and shortening the period of advancing toward the 
modern market economy to create a new economic structure with 
greater vitality and vigor. 
<H3>  On the Issue of Economic Relations between the Central 
Authorities and Localities </H3>
  To give full play to the initiatives of both the central 
authorities and localities is a principle that we have persisted 
in for a long time, as well as the summation of historical 
experiences. Initiative is precisely a productive force. To 
suffocate initiative means precisely to jeopardize productive 
forces. In the course of reform, we will not consider the 
initiation of one aspect, while jeopardizing initiation of 
another. In handling relations between the central authorities 
and localities, the part must be subordinated to the whole, and 
the whole should give considerations to the parts. Only when 
the initiative of both are given play will the overall situation 
be insured. If the proportion of the central financial revenue 
is too low, central macroeconomic regulation and control would 
be affected and weakened, the common development between regions 
and social organizations could not be insured, and it would even 
be difficult to cover necessary expenditures in state 
administration and the normal operation of state organs. For 
the unification of the state, social stability, and economic 
development, minor truths must subordinated to the major one. 
Of course, the vested interest of the part should also be given 
full consideration. 
  To accelerate the reform of macroeconomic regulation and 
control, we shall implement a standardized tax-sharing system; 
that is not to return to the old path of excessive 
centralization, not to negate the plural subjective aspects of 
interest, nor does it mean forgetting about the initiative of 
localities, but building the basic framework of the socialist 
market economic structure in its macroscopic aspect. It 
requires defining financial power on the basis of defining the 
power of governments at various levels, and implementing a 
standardized, scientific financial distribution system of the 
central and local governments to promote the common economic 
development in both eastern and western China. Our principle is 
to allow some regions to become well off first, but not to slow 
development in the eastern regions to narrow the gap between 
east and west. Because the tax-sharing system is helpful in 
breaking regional blockades and market separation, the coastal 
areas where the market mechanism was built earlier with high 
economic efficiency will acquire more interest through fair 
competition in a unified, orderly large market. Whereas middle 
and western regions may have greater opportunity for development 
on the basis of augmenting central financial strength and 
building a unified market system. Basically, of course, the 
development of the middle and western regions should be realized 
in market competition, by relying on their own efforts and 
improvement in economic returns to gradually realize common 
prosperity. 
  The building of a new macroeconomic regulation and control 
structure will be helpful in giving play to the initiative of 
various aspects. The central authorities may utilize financial 
and monetary policies in a comprehensive way to regulate the 
balance of the general social volume to insure sustained, high, 
and healthy economic growth. All regions should compete with 
and support each other to achieve common improvement and 
prosperity. 
<H5>  On the Issue of Fairness and Efficiency </H5>
  Fairness and efficiency are ancient propositions in the 
theory of economics. The majority of Western economists have 
tried to study realistic economic operation and laws of 
development to seek the greatest possible economic return under 
private ownership without touching the capitalist economic 
system as a prerequisite. Marxist political economics takes 
production relations as its subject of study, and its basic aim 
lies in developing the productive force to the maximum through 
changing production relations and emancipating productive 
forces. It is a misunderstanding to believe that Marxist 
economics deals only the issue of social fairness. The 
superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system 
does not depend on moral criteria, but mainly finds expression 
in its ability to create a higher productive force than 
capitalism. Basically, the realization of social fairness and 
common prosperity on the basis of high efficiency is the 
essential definition of the socialist system. 
  It is imperative to adhere to the principle of giving 
priority to efficiency while giving consideration to fairness. 
Paying attention to development, material interests, market 
allocation of resources, and advocating science and technology 
being the primary productive force are all included in the 
principle of giving prominence to efficiency. 
  It is necessary to stress the principle of giving priority 
to 
efficiency in primary distribution. Adherence to the principle 
of distribution according to work, more work for more pay is 
precisely the principle of giving priority to efficiency; it 
embodies genuine fairness at the same time. The principle of 
fairness is stressed in social redistribution; however, 
efficiency should not be jeopardized by any means. Through 
regulation of taxation, building of the social insurance system, 
and other means of social redistribution, the government 
resolves the excessive gap resulting from primary distribution, 
and guards against polarization on the basis of insuring 
efficiency top realize common prosperity. 
  In a certain sense, fairness is not only embodied in the 
arena of distribution, but also in the opportunity and condition 
for competition on an equal basis to achieve high efficiency 
through such competition. This being the case, it is necessary 
for us to work hard to build standardized market competition 
order and regulations, so that efficiency and fairness may be 
genuinely unified. 
<H5>  On the Issue of Gradual Reform and Phased Breakthroughs </H5>
  The development of productive forces is permanent, so is the 
change in production relations. The way to push reform should 
be determined by the needs of development. Development in 
different stages and areas sets out different requirements on 
reform; therefore, we should suit measures to local conditions 
and the time, form, magnitude, and steps of pushing reform. 
  Experiences in 15-years of reform show that gradual reform 
in 
the market orientation has avoided the tremendous shock in the 
socioeconomy that resulted from the "shock treatment" adopted by 
the former USSR and East European countries, and is a successful 
road that falls in line with China's national conditions. The 
graduality of reform in its entirety was grounded on the fact 
that we had no ready pattern to copy in theory and practice; 
consequently, we must learn war through war. In development, we 
have adhered to reform to promote development with reform, while 
checking and testing reform with the results of development. 
That is a basic experience in China's reform. However, when 
reform has entered the present stage of tackling bottlenecks, 
should graduality, being sure and steady be stressed 
excessively, this would end in missing the opportunity, 
artificially prolonging the transition period, and eventually 
increasing the risk and cost of reform. This being the case, we 
should adopt more enthusiastic and active principles, working 
hard to gain substantial progress at every stage. Generally, 
the fundamental way to push China's reform should be "making 
gradual progress in entirety, with phased breakthroughs." 
  Regarding reforms that have a bearing on the macroscopic 
tier of the overall situation, such as finance, taxation, and 
banking and foreign exchange, it is imperative to have a unified 
design and thorough-going implementation. Regarding some 
reforms at microscopic tier, such as enterprise and housing 
reform, they can be conducted in certain units on an 
experimental basis to gain experiences and then spread at an 
appropriate time. Regarding some reforms with ripe conditions, 
larger strides and a quicker pace can be taken. The pace of 
reform may be quickened in special economic zones, coastal 
areas, and cities where experiments are conducted; they may take 
the lead in building the new economic structure. Development 
zone in various categories and newly-built projects should be 
designed and operated based on the new structure from the very 
start. 
  In reform, it is imperative to boldly blaze new trails, and 
break through old structures, and at the same time acquire 
rational standardization and build new structures. 
Standardization is relative; in some cases, experiments can be 
conducted first before standardization; in other cases, 
standardization can be formulated first before implementation. 
The mature, effective practices and experiences of countries 
which have implemented the market economy for years, and which 
embody socialized production and the general law governing the 
market economy, can be taken for reference and direct absorption. 
<H3>  Accelerate Building of the General Framework of the 
Socialist Market Economic Structure </H3>
  At the discussion meeting on economic work of 10 provinces 
and regions of southcentral and southwestern China, Comrade 
Jiang Zemin emphasized: "Building the new economic structure is 
a great feat of socialist system engineering; it is imperative 
to firmly grasp the formulation of the general framework." From 
breaking down the old structure to building the new one, from 
demolishing the "old house" to setting up the "new building," it 
is a process of conversion from destruction to establishment. 
Setting up the "new building" of the socialist market economic 
structure involves the meticulous design of the pillars and 
drawing the blueprint of the general framework. 
  At a meeting in May, I listed 10 aspects in the general 
framework of the socialist market economic structure. Through 
several months of study and exploration and hearing opinions 
from various departments, we have further deepened our 
understanding, and the contents are now somewhat readjusted. 
Here, I should like to deal briefly with the main points. 
<H5>  On the Ownership Structure </H5>
  Our basic principle is to adhere to taking public ownership 
as the main body, with the long-term coexistence, common 
development, and equal competition of diversified economic 
factors. Taking the public ownership as the main body is the 
basic characteristic of the socialist economic system; 
resolution of realization of the microscopic forms of the public 
ownership economy under the condition of the market economy, as 
well as the organic combination of the public ownership and the 
market economy, are the most important topics in building the 
new economic structure. 
  The core issues and difficulties in reform today do not lie 
in the question of whether or not diversified economic factors 
can develop, but in how state-owned enterprises can be developed 
and strengthened. It is necessary to study how to do a good job 
of managing state-owned enterprises, continuously strengthen 
their vigor mainly through the channel of improving quality and 
efficiency, and have them play the dominant role in fair market 
competition. Of course, the development of a non-public 
ownership economy has its own place and role; it is necessary to 
augment guidance, supervision, and control while encouraging its 
development. 
  State-owned assets should realize value preservation and 
appreciation through readjustment, which precisely means 
flowing. However, the flow of state-owned assets does not mean 
loss. The readjustment and flow of state-owned assets are means 
of appreciation; in other words, it is realizing optimal 
allocation of resources under the working of the market 
mechanism to endow the form of capital to state-owned assets. 
With the flow and reorganization of assets, the number of 
economic units with mixed ownership of assets will become 
increasingly greater; inevitably, the ownership structure will 
take on a new pattern. This is a trend that calls for our 
sufficient attention. 
<H5>  On the Building of Modern Enterprise System </H5>
  Building a modern enterprise system is the enrichment and 
development of the socialist market economic theory as well as 
the foundation and key to building the new structure. This is 
just the task for state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in 
other categories should also work hard in this direction. 
  State-owned enterprises should have explicit ownership of 
state- owned assets and a legal say in the disposal of 
enterprise assets; on this basis, they should explore the 
effective forms of realization according to different situation. 
The company is the main form of modern enterprise system. 
However, the modern enterprise system does not equate with 
turning an enterprise into a company, or a share-holding 
company, limited, or a listed share- holding company, limited. 
The key to reorganization of the company system is reorganizing 
those state-owned enterprises with mature conditions into 
companies with limited responsibility or limited share-holding 
companies according to the law, so that the enterprise many 
genuinely become a legal person and vigor, operating on its own, 
assuming sole responsibility for its profits and losses and the 
subjective aspect in market competition. Regarding the small 
number of enterprises that possess conditions, they can be 
reorganized into listed limited share-holding companies through 
strict examination and approval. 
  Presently, the key to the voluminous enterprises that do not 
possess conditions to be reorganized into companies is to 
implement the "Enterprise Law," "Rules and Regulations for 
Industrial Enterprises of Ownership by All People To Convert 
Operational Mechanisms," and "Rules and Regulations for 
Financial Supervision and Control Over State-Owned Enterprises," 
work hard at converting enterprise operational mechanisms, find 
specific ways of cutting back the historical and social burdens 
of state-owned enterprises, and insure enterprise autonomy, as 
well as the value preservation and appreciation of state-owned 
assets. 
  In the wake of a state-owned enterprise realizing the modern 
enterprise system, if it has genuinely converted its operational 
mechanism, completed and perfected management, mastered high 
technology, and enjoyed advantages in fierce world competition, 
then that reform is successful. Of course, the enterprise 
system does not have an ultimate pattern, and will be 
continuously developed, completed, and perfected in practice. 
<H3>  On Building a Unified, Open Market System of Orderly 
Competition </H3>
  Presently, the two-track price system for production 
essentials remains and is a cause leading to non-standardized 
economic operation and the rise of unhealthy tendencies and 
phenomena of corruption. With the exception of some individual 
varieties, control over prices for the overwhelming majority of 
commodities, the labor force, and other production essentials 
should be lifted to shape the mechanism of the market 
determining prices. The task is still great to make the market 
decide prices for production essentials. 
  To complete and perfect the market system, it is necessary 
to 
make nurturing a developed commodity market the base, with 
developing production essentials market as the key. We should 
gradually shape a unified and open-market pattern, which is 
healthy and complete, which is characterized by the coexistence 
of diversified economic factors, operational ways, and channels 
of circulation, organically links wholesale and retail 
businesses, and mutually accommodating domestic and foreign 
trade. Presently, it is especially necessary to emphasize the 
unification and opening up of the domestic market, oppose 
separation and blockades, and build a unified, healthy, and 
complete market competition order and a complete and perfect 
market organizational and administrative system. 
<H3>  On Converting Government Economic Administrative Functions 
and Building the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control System </H3>
  To build an effective macroeconomic regulation and control 
system is to overcome the shortcomings of the market mechanism 
itself and insure sustained, high, and healthy economic growth. 
To do a good job of macroeconomic regulation and control, it is 
necessary to correctly handle relations among planning, finance, 
and banks so that they may work in a rational division of labor 
and form a whole range in harmony, while restricting each other. 
The main target of banks is to maintain a stable currency and 
the control monetary supply; regarding finance, its main target 
is to conduct readjustment in the economic as well as regional 
structure and social distribution; with planning, its main 
target is to formulate principles, policies, and strategic 
planning for long and medium- range economic development, and 
set out economic policies and means of comprehensive 
application. The state should apply financial and monetary 
policy in a comprehensive way, and guide as well as regulate the 
large balance between the general volume of demand and supply. 
  While converting the government economic administrative 
functions, it is imperative to reform government economic 
administrative organizations; augment macroeconomic regulation, 
control and supervise departments; intensify social 
administrative functions; be determined to remove or merge 
specialized economic administrative departments; build, 
complete, and perfect the administrative system of state-owned 
assets, as well as its operational system; and implement a civil 
service system based on the principle of streamlining and high 
efficiency. In addition, it is necessary to establish standards 
in conformity with the needs of the market economy according to 
law and complete and perfect intermediary organizations. 
<H3>  On Building an Individual Income Distribution System Giving 
Priority to Efficiency While Taking Fairness Into Consideration </H3>
  It is necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution 
according to work, with coexistence of diversified means of 
distribution. Worker pay should be chiefly determined by market 
competition, with implementation of the principle of more work 
for more pay, and the wage gap appropriately widened; the 
enterprise wage level and form should be chiefly determined by 
labor productivity, economic returns, and the condition of 
supply and demand on the labor employment market. 
  It is necessary to change the lack of standardization and 
transparency in individual income resulting from distribution in 
kind and subsidies from various departments and gradually 
realize individual income in the form of banknotes. With market 
economic development, pluralism in the ownership structure, and 
the gradual increase in individual chattel, it is imperative to 
study in depth the new conditions and problems arising from 
production essentials entering individual income distribution. 
  Through the building of the tax regulation and social 
insurance system and other means of social redistribution, 
especially work in completing, perfecting and augmenting 
collection of individual income tax, the individual income gap 
will be narrowed to avoid the surfacing of polarization 
resulting from the sharp difference in individual income while 
taking the road of common prosperity. 
<H5>  On Building the Socialist Insurance System </H5>
  The key to the social security system is the establishment 
of 
the socialist insurance system, while shaping a whole range of 
social relief and welfare, as well as arrangements for special 
care to disabled servicemen and family members of revolutionary 
martyrs and servicemen. Presently, the key is to build, 
complete, and perfect pension and medical care insurance 
systems. It is necessary gradually to increase the proportion 
of individual payment through reform and implement the 
combination of overall social planning and individual accounts. 
It is necessary to determine the sources of social insurance 
funds according to different types of social security to shape 
into a sound circulation mechanism for the collection, 
operation, and appreciation of the social insurance fund. 
Attention should be paid to a relative balance in the social 
security level, the productive force development, and bearing 
capacity of various social and economic aspects; we should 
refrain from pursuing high welfare levels. Presently, it is 
necessary to unify the administrative structure of social 
security and formulate unified policies according to the 
principle of separating government and institutions, while 
establishing multiform intermediary organizations and 
realization of socialized service. 
  China's new urban housing system is one characterized by a 
combination of market regulation and social security. It is 
necessary to set up an accumulation fund and other forms of 
savings for housing; an investment structure for housing 
construction with expenses shared by the state, the unit, and 
the individual; a commodity housing supply system with 
high-income residents as subjects, as well as an economical, 
practical housing supply system possessing the nature of social 
security, with ordinary citizens as the subjects; a system of 
transaction of housing property rights; and augmentation of 
maintenance and management services after sales, and so forth. 
Reform today should take the marketing of public-owned housing 
as the key and accelerate the progress of turning housing into a 
commodity. Social security and reform in the housing system 
should start with state-owned enterprises, especially large and 
medium-sized enterprises; the enterprise burden should be cut 
back, while promoting the conversion of enterprise operational 
mechanisms. 
<H3>  On Building Foreign Economic Structures in Conformity With 
International Usual Practice, in Active Participation With 
International Competition, and Cooperation </H3>
  The market economy is itself an open-type economy. With the 
progress of reform and opening up, China will inevitably further 
expand its link with the world economy. On the one hand, it is 
necessary to utilize comparative advantages in the international 
division of labor and international exchanges. In establishing 
the new structure, we should promote the two-way dovetailing of 
the domestic and world market. On the other hand, it is 
necessary to see that mormal international practices are not 
absolute, and the present-day normal international practice is 
to the advantage of developed countries. Even so, the friction 
in trade between developed countries remains very intense. It 
is necessary for us to work hard to build a new world economic 
order, pay attention to protecting national interests, and 
promote economic development in opening up and world competition. 
  It is necessary to further reform the administrative 
structure of foreign trade and exchange. We should develop a 
large number of foreign trade companies which are 
internationalized and standardized in behavior and combine 
industry and trade, push large-type enterprise groups and 
enterprises in townships and towns where conditions are ripe to 
directly participate in world competition, and expand economic, 
technological cooperation and ties in trade with all countries. 
<H5>  On Deepening Rural Economic Restructuring </H5>
  Presently, special attention should be paid to studying the 
building of rural macroeconomic regulation and control system 
and increasing peasant income. Macroeconomic regulation and 
control of the general volume of farm produce will be conducted 
through such means as a special grain reserve, grain risk fund, 
finance for the implementation of rural policy, and control over 
import of farm produce. It is necessary genuinely to increase 
peasant income through reform and resolve the comparatively low 
interest of agriculture. Several steps may be taken into 
consideration, namely: First, readjust the rural industrial 
setup by developing agriculture of high quality, yield, and 
economic return; second, conduct operations of appropriate 
scope, while allowing the inheritance and transfer of peasants' 
contracted land use according to the law; third, develop 
enterprises in townships and towns in a big way; fourth, adopt a 
policy of protection, including state price protection for major 
farm produce, protection of arable land, and environmental 
protection; fifth, develop urban and rural labor employment 
markets in a planned way to absorb the surplus rural labor 
force; and sixth, accelerate building of small rural towns, 
giving play to economic returns of scope and effects of 
assembling. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job of 
county-level comprehensive reform, and promote the progress of 
urban and rural economic unification, as well as the overall 
development in rural social, economic and cultural undertakings. 
<H3>  On Building a New Structure for Social Development in 
Undertakings in Science, Technology, Education, and Culture 
Compatible with the Socialist Market Economy </H3>
  Science and technology are primary productive forces; the 
realization of modernization is ultimately determined by 
improvement in the quality of the entire nation. Economic 
competition in the 21st century focuses on scientific and 
technological levels and the modernization of education. 
Whoever masters high science and technology and high-quality 
talents will win the initiative. The majority of research 
institutes should directly serve economic construction and 
establish a system of the economic legal person. In scientific 
research institutes, results as well as scientists and 
technicians that are able to enter the market should be open. 
Division in the flow of qualified people should be implemented, 
science and technology markets developed, and the unification of 
science, technology, and the economy promoted. It is necessary 
to regard education as the basic engineering of economic 
development, while giving full play to the enthusiasm of society 
running schools so that education may bring up more high-quality 
qualified people for socialist modernization. 
<H3>  On Building Completed and Perfect Legal System of the 
Socialist Market Economy </H3>
  The market economic structure is in essence an economy 
characterized by the legal system. The change from the "rule of 
man" to a legal system in economic administration is an 
important sign of the establishment of the new structure. In 
the course of building the new structure, a major task for the 
government is to establish a complete and perfect system of 
laws, decrees, and regulations to standardize the operation of 
all economic arenas and links, the economic behavior of the 
government, enterprises and individuals, and augment economic 
supervision to realize the standardization and legalization of 
economic relations, operation, and administration. We may put 
it that the speed in establishing economic laws, decrees and 
regulations has a direct bearing on the progress in building the 
new structure. 
<H3>  Augment Study, Elevate Our Political, Ideological, 
Theoretical and Policy Level </H3>
  By the end of the year, we are to mark the centenary of 
Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping will also be published and 
circulated. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the chief architect of 
socialist reform, opening up and modernization in China, and the 
contemporary Marxist founder of the theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin indicated 
that the 14th Party Congress set out the strategic task to arm 
the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. This is 
the pressing need of the great practice in pushing reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization, and basic insurance for 
adhering to the party basic line for a century without wavering. 
The three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping are a whole. The Volume 3 to be published soon 
and Volume 2 published 10 years ago have collected the most 
important works with the greatest originality of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping in the shaping and development of his theory. They are 
rich in content, cover an extensive range of subjects with 
incisive insight, filled with sharp spirit of the times and the 
national spirit, and shine with the brilliance of the Marxist 
truth. In studying volume three, it is imperative to earnestly 
learn from Comrade Xiaoping in applying to the Marxist position, 
viewpoints, and approaches, his scientific attitude, creative 
spirit, and revolutionary style in studying new conditions to 
resolve new problems. It is necessary to bring forward the 
Marxist study style in a big way. Efforts should be made in 
studying the original texts, working hard to achieve mastery 
through comprehensive study, and grasping their spiritual 
essence, and in combining theory and practice by linking them to 
the current situation and tasks to improve the ability to 
analyze and resolve problems. It is necessary to work hard at 
unifying thinking by linking it to the experiences since reform 
and opening up and the realities of one's thinking and work, to 
summarize experiences and lessons, clarify muddleheaded ideas, 
and guide one's practice with correct theory. The Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th Central Committee to be convoked soon is to 
adopt a "decision" on several issues on building the socialist 
market economic structure. The "decision" is a programmatic 
document to guide our reform work for several years to come 
which also calls for efforts to do a good job of organizing its 
study. 
  Sole reliance on zeal in pursuing reform is not enough; one 
must work hard and be good at study. Practice, research, 
summation, and reference all fall into the category of study. 
The better one's study, the faster one's level will be 
elevated, and the greater the results in one's work. Here, I 
should like to set a requirement on you, namely, I hope that 
every comrade will work hard to become an expert in some field 
and keep in touch with a number of Chinese and foreign experts 
in the same field. This way, the situation of our work will 
certainly be greatly changed. It is impossible to enlighten 
others with one's muddle-headedness. At the same time, one 
should not always be ignorant, repeating what other people said. 
For this reason, it is imperative for us to set up a complete 
and perfect system for study and adhere to it. 
<H3>  Change Work Method, Do a Good Job of Self Reform To Be 
Compatible With Reform's Historical Change From "Destruction" to 
"Establishment" </H3>
  Comrades of restructuring the economy departments must be 
modest and meticulous and good at cooperating with other 
departments, and set out their plans and train of thought on the 
basis of earnestly lending an ear and absorbing the opinions of 
other departments. The cause of reform is one that concerns the 
whole party and country, not just the affairs of one department 
alone. We should offer help to each other, by no means should 
we jeopardize each other in our relations with other departments. 
  We should attach importance to the formulation of plans for 
reform. In the wake of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
Central Committee, the Commission for Restructuring the Economy 
should formulate more detailed planning for reform and present 
its plans for implementation. In planning and the plan for 
implementation, it is necessary to have a definite object in 
view, with a very explicit goal and a whole-range of decrees and 
regulations which can working. At the same time, it is 
necessary to include in our work agenda plans for bringing up 
cadres, specific regulations for implementation, and wide 
ranging decrees before implementation, as well as possible 
problems surfacing in the course of implementation. We are 
"designers" but should also be good at being "engineers." 
  While formulating plans for reform, it is necessary to 
augment work in policy research. We should watch closely and 
analyze the actual conditions in economic life, think in line 
with what is in the minds of leading comrades, and be anxious 
about what leading comrades are anxious about, while making 
proposals and suggestions of decisionmaking value. Key, 
difficult points and hot spot issues and deeper-tier problems 
are precisely those key points and hot spot issues to be studied 
in our reform. For example, with the presentation of reforms in 
banking, finance, and taxation, it is necessary for us to 
earnestly study the possible further widening in the gap of 
western region with its comparatively low competitiveness; the 
question of how to resolve the social and historical burden of 
large and medium-sized state-own enterprises; and the issue of 
how to increase peasant income. 
  In building the socialist market economic structure, there 
are many things that call on us to refer to the experiences of 
Western market economies. One way is to make investigation 
overseas; another way is to study from books. However, we 
should always bear in mind China's national conditions. That 
precisely means doing a good job of investigation and study, 
analyzing where the crux lies, and writing research reports that 
are of some weight, with deep insight and sound proposals. I 
suggest that comrades more often go down to stay at the 
grass-roots rural areas and enterprises to make friends with 
more workers, peasants, intellectuals, and entrepreneurs, and 
hear straight from them their opinions and suggestions. 
  We hope that various localities will attach importance to, 
augment, and support work in restructuring the economy. 
Comrades in restructuring the economy departments should also 
accomplish something and do a good job of being the assistants 
to leadership at various levels through their own hard work. 
<H3>  Another Very Important Task for Restructuring the Economy 
Departments Is Precisely To Augment Building of Rank and File, 
Improve Their Qualities, and Improve Work Style </H3>
  We should pay special attention to improving our own 
political qualities. The aim of reform is to build the 
socialist market economic structure. It is not enough to have 
some general knowledge about the market economy, and it is 
imperative to genuinely grasp the basic principle and essential 
characteristics of socialism, and a comparatively high 
cultivation of Marxist theory and political level. 
  Presently, it is necessary to implement earnestly the 
central 
decision to continue to push the anti-corruption struggle. 
Comrades of the Commission for Restructuring the Economy must 
exercise self- discipline on the one hand and block structural 
loopholes that give rise to corruption through accelerating 
reform. 
  It is necessary to further improve work style as well as 
work 
efficiency. We who are engaged in reforms must primarily have a 
strong awareness of reform. We should not stop at formulating 
plans for reforms and asking others to conduct reforms, but 
should take the lead in reforming our own work, improve work and 
work efficiency inside the Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy in the spirit and courage of reform. 
  The cause of reform calls for a strong enterprising spirit, 
and people with devotion. I believe that many comrades who are 
determined to conduct reform are willing to work at 
restructuring the economy departments and make contributions to 
China's reform. I believe that many comrades of our 
restructuring the economy departments will do a good job of 
restructuring theeconomy. We should create conditions to absorb 
a large number of fine qualified people with aspirations to work 
in restructuring the economy departments. 
  Presently we are in a new historical period, and are 
pursuing 
the building of a socialist market economic structure, an 
undertaking unprecedented in human history. Our task is 
precisely to do a very good job. Comrades of the Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy must emancipate their minds, brace up, 
and work hard to accomplish something. I believe that under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, our cause of 
reform will certainly be successful, and the magnificent goal of 
modernization will certainly be realized.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter from Chinese Capital" by staff reporter Ma Ling </F>
(7456 3781): "Race Between High Growth and High Inflation: 
Beijing Scholars Analyze `Top Economic Priority' in 1994"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jan (TA KUNG PAO) -- Jiang Zemin 
Consults Economists 
  The year 1994 is an important one for reform. With the 
dawning of the new year, the unitary and managed floating 
exchange rate system of the renminbi on the basis of market 
supply and demand was formally introduced, thus marking a great 
stride forward in the foreign exchange management system. 
Simultaneously, or immediately afterward, the work to establish 
a modern enterprise system, as well as reform in the market 
system, taxation, finance, foreign trade, housing, and other 
important spheres was or will be carried out. 
  With the rapid advance and a deeper degree of reform, the 
Chinese economy is bound to face a new and rigorous test. 
  How can we achieve high-speed growth without causing 
inflation? 
  It has been learned that President Jiang Zemin consulted 
several noted economists on this problem. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of economic 
affairs, also is seeking the best way to solve this problem. 
  As a matter of fact, an outlook of China's economic 
situation 
in 1994 shows that it is very necessary to study and discuss 
this problem in a profound manner. 
  According to economists' predictions, the national economy 
will maintain high-speed growth in 1994 because of the strong 
support of the following four factors: 1) The large domestic 
demand of this country of 1.2 billion can continue to give the 
necessary impetus to economic growth. 2) Owing to unbalanced 
industrial development and relatively backward basic industries 
and infrastructure, it is necessary to strengthen construction, 
which can give a strong impetus to current economic development, 
as well as create conditions for future economic development. 
3) The driving force of reform remains strong in the process 
of transforming the old system into a new one, and the 
production potentials that were restrained under the old system 
still have to be released continuously. 4) In order to carry 
out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside 
world, the Chinese economy will draw closer to the international 
economy. China can constantly introduce and assimilate advanced 
technology and management experience from other countries, 
absorb international resources to make up domestic deficiency, 
and strengthen the domestic economy's capability to develop. 
<H5>  Four Negative Effects of Macroscopic Regulation </H5>
  Viewed from the situation in 1993, high-speed economic 
growth 
will bring about a painful lesson if it is not grasped 
scientifically and effectively. Last year, at a time when high- 
speed economic growth was being achieved, prices also soared and 
there was a very severe phenomenon of economic disorder. With 
the second half of last year, the central authorities could not 
help but introduce emergency macroscopic regulation measures. 
This series of measures already has achieved some results, the 
situation of economic disorder has changed, and the overall 
situation is developing in a positive way, but the Chinese 
economy still faces three kinds of problems following the 
introduction of macroscopic regulation: 1) The level of 
commodity price rises in the market is still too high. 
Commodity price is a "backward" index that fully reflects the 
situation of high economic growth, the policy of large currency 
supply, and vigorous price reform in the previous stage. 2) 
Four negative effects are exposed by macroscopic regulation: 
Insufficient funds, a discrepancy between production and 
marketing and more payments in arrears, the frequent occurrence 
of the phenomena of production stoppage and semistoppage, and 
lower industrial benefits. 3) The phenomenon of unbalanced 
economic development still exists and there is no marked 
progress in structural readjustment. 
  According to figures released by the State Statistics 
Bureau, 
the economic growth rate in China last year was 13 percent and 
the inflation rate also was 13 percent. These two figures were 
precisely the real situation of China's economic development in 
1993. 
  Viewed from the prospects of the economy and commodity 
prices 
in China in 1994, experts predict that the economy will continue 
to maintain a growth rate of 10 percent or so, and that only 
after a series of effective measures are taken by the government 
can the inflation rate be controlled at 10 percent or so. 
  Hence, we can see also that the situation in 1994 will 
hardly 
be less grim than that in 1993. 
<H5>  Reform Measures Are Related to Commodity Prices </H5>
  Some economists pointed out: The negative effects were 
exposed by macroscopic regulation after last August, and the 
central authorities put a large amount of currency into 
circulation. From the angle of economics, commodity prices will 
rise about a year after currency circulation, so after the 
coming August, inflation may arise again in society and the 
government will bear great commodity price pressures. 
  On the other hand, viewed from China's current social 
situation, only at a level of slight price rises can rapid 
growth of the national economy be achieved. This is because: 
1) As returns on investment in industrial enterprises are low 
in times of high inflation rates, a large amount of funds will 
be shifted to stock speculation, real estate, and other 
non-productive areas, which makes it very easy for a 
bubble-economy craze to arise, thus aggravating the investment 
and industrial structures, and damaging the national economy's 
foundation for rapid growth. 2) High inflation will strain 
every aspect of the national economy so that it is difficult to 
implement various measures conducive to reform, thus generating 
greater difficulties and risks. 3) High inflation also will 
offer a chance for illegal elements to disrupt the market, thus 
making it more difficult to complete the marketization process. 
4. High inflation also will affect residents' psychological 
endurance, thus giving rise to social instability factors. 
  As a matter of fact, a series of new reform measures 
introduced for the sake of accelerating the implementation of 
the market economy are related, more or less, to the commodity 
price factor. 
  President Jiang Zemin said at the new year tea party 
organized by the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference National Committee: "We must meticulously organize 
the introduction and implementation of a series of important 
reform measures for the establishment of socialist market 
economic system.... We must pay the utmost attention to our 
progress, promptly sum up our experience, and strive to succeed 
in implementing these measures." 
  Hence, we can notice the determination and vigilance of the 
central government in implementing reform measures in 1994. 
  The year 1994 is key to China's reform, and the relationship 
between high-speed development and a check on inflation 
undoubtedly will be a top consideration.

<F P=106> [Interview with economist Wu Jinglian by staff reporter Lin </F>
Chen (2651 2525); place and date not given: "Take Great Care 
Not To Let the Reform Go Out of Shape"] 
  [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee made the decision to push ahead with the reform in a 
comprehensive way. The promulgation of the "50 Articles," 
dubbed as a "program for action in the reform of the economic 
structure in the nineties," signals that China's reform has 
entered the stage of tackling key issues. At this moment, how 
to continue summing up the positive and negative experiences in 
the past 15 years of reform provides a mirror for the full-scale 
advancement of the reform in the next stage, and making a good 
job of the first step in tackling the key issues has become very 
important. With this thought in mind, this reporter interviewed 
Chinese economist Wu Jinglian. 
  [Lin Chen] As an economist, you have all along had a part in 
the whole process of China's economic structural reform and in 
the formulation of many major reform proposals. What is your 
comment on the reform in the past 15 years? 
  [Wu Jinglian] China's reform has made progress in many 
important fields. In particular, the gradual establishment of 
the target model of building a socialist market economy is a 
great theoretical achievement. However, one should also 
recognize that reform is still relatively lagging behind in many 
key areas. For instance, though we have made quite some efforts 
in the reform of state-owned enterprises, we have failed to 
achieve any real breakthrough; in the development of the market 
system, the building of commodity markets has been advancing at 
a fast pace, but the building of such production elements 
markets as the money market and labor market is lagging behind 
by comparison. Because of the slow- moving reform in key 
sectors, some important social and economic problems are hard to 
resolve properly. For example, the three biggest issues, 
namely, inflation, corruption, and unfair distribution of wealth 
in society, are still bothering us to this day. In short, in 
terms of reform, things that are easy to do are almost all done, 
and what are left are the more difficult things. Therefore, in 
my opinion, the reform is entering the stage of tackling key 
issues in the next phase. The great significance of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is that it 
issued the order to start storming difficult problems. 
  [Lin] In that case, what do you think we should pay 
attention to in the operation to storm difficult problems? 
  [Wu] The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee gives a clear and detailed outline of the 
reform to be carried out in the revenue and taxation, monetary, 
investment, and exchange systems. The question now is how to 
make sure that these proposals do not go out of shape or change 
flavor in the course of implementation. Sometimes, a good 
reform proposal turns out to be nothing like what was expected 
once it is put into practice. In this respect, we have a lot of 
experience to draw lessons from. 
  [Lin] There are many reasons why a reform goes out of shape. 
It might be connected to some problem of understanding, 
operational problems, or motivation by interests. 
  [Wu] I agree. First and foremost is the problem with 
understanding and the second is the problem with interests. The 
latter deserves special attention. For instance, some people 
often interpret new things in the context of market economy from 
a point of view that carries the hallmark of the planned 
economy. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee points out: "The purpose of 
establishing a system of socialist market economy is to let the 
market function as the foundation of resource disposition under 
the macroregulation and control of the state." If, according to 
the nature of market economy, macroregulation and control is 
correctly interpreted as regulation and control over total 
supply and demand (such as total monetary supply and demand), 
this would be a correct notion. The problem is that some people 
have now expanded the definition of macroregulation and control 
and put everything that the state considers important and 
necessary to control in the category of macroregulation and 
control. This is like putting the role of the market into the 
bag of the government's administrative control. In fact, this 
is a misunderstanding. Macroregulation and control is inherent 
in the notion of market economy. All developed nations with 
market economy exercise control over total supply and demand. 
This is called macroregulation and control. But one should not 
draw a parallel between micro administrative intervention and 
macroregulation and control. In order to prevent the reform 
from going out of shape, it is necessary to change the incorrect 
way of thinking that rejects the government's role once market 
policy is implemented and, whenever macroregulation and control 
is emphasized, puts everything under government control. 
  There is another opinion, which goes to the other extreme. 
Whenever market regulation is encouraged, they will think that 
as long as there is a market, whatever the quality, it will be 
able to dispose of resources in the most efficient way; or even 
think that a speculation-dominated market can play the same 
role. Therefore, the end results of some reforms, which started 
in the right direction, are not as desired. Take the 
batch-leasing of land for example. This is a reform in line with 
the market orientation. However, batch-leasing of land in a 
market economy must be conducted in accordance with strict 
market procedures and rules. But we omitted the second part 
when employing this means. In other words, the administration 
made all the decisions on the leasing and the rates of lease. 
As a result, some people have made big fortunes by using 
administrative powers and the otherwise fine market means has 
become a hotbed of corruption. 
  [Lin] Speaking of this, people tend to blame this problem 
on land batch-leasing as a market means and rarely consider the 
mistakes we made when using this means. It seems that when the 
reform goes out of shape, not only the people's interests are 
harmed, but the reputation of reform is undermined. 
  [Wu] That is true. To change this situation, we all face 
the need for restudy. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we must 
acquire the knowledge of market economy. In the meantime, the 
guiding role of the propaganda media is also very important. It 
is not good to describe market building as either too easy or 
too simple. Spreading specious viewpoints will exert a more 
negative impact. Now people are vying with each other to run 
futures markets, believing that they are "big fish." In fact, 
futures trading involves extremely big risks, because it is 
commodity trading based on expected prices. To use a common 
expression, futures trading means carrying out a commodity deal 
in relation to which the delivery will not be executed until a 
certain point in the future, and the risk lies in the projection 
of the price at the time of delivery. Therefore, one may say 
that the function of futures is to help the producer and the 
trader avoid risks, so that large-scale economic activities can 
go ahead. Naturally, however, this requires interaction between 
the speculators and the parties trying to avoid risks. In this 
context, speculation does have a positive role. However, it is 
very wrong to think that pure speculation is also positive and 
therefore encourage speculation unconditionally. Pure 
speculation is no different from gambling. It is either you 
lose, I gain or the other way round. It does not create 
material wealth. On the contrary, excessive speculation has a 
destructive function. I feel that for some time in the past, the 
way we described futures was not comprehensive enough and was 
sometimes even misleading. This has caused some of those 
involved in it to overlook the risks they should bear while 
looking forward eagerly to making a fortune. As a result, the 
country rushed headlong into setting up futures markets, sowing 
the seeds of crisis from the very beginning. Some law-breaking 
businessmen from abroad made big fortunes while the people and 
the state suffered great losses. 
  [Lin] The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee places the reform of state-owned 
enterprises in a very important position and sets goals for 
establishing a modern enterprise system. What is your comment 
on this, Mr. Wu? 
  [Wu] In the reform of large and medium-sized state 
enterprises, two concepts have now been accepted by most people. 
One is that a modern enterprise system must be established; the 
other is that company-oriented transformation must be conducted. 
Recognizing this point may be considered a major breakthrough in 
the understanding of enterprise reform. In my opinion, what is 
called the modern enterprise system is actually the modern 
corporate system: They are one and the same. But some 
theoretical issues and policy issues regarding how to transform 
our country's state-owned enterprises into modern companies have 
not yet been completely solved. How to understand public 
ownership as the predominant sector, what concrete forms public 
ownership should take, who shall represent state property 
rights, and how to embody the leading role of the Communist 
Party in the general manager responsibility system under the 
leadership of the chairman of the board -- all these issues 
should be conscientiously tackled. Only by so doing can we 
truly establish a modern enterprise system. 
  [Lin] In the process of reform in the past, we have 
experimented with many methods, such as the economic accounting 
system, factory director responsibility system, economic 
responsibility system, enterprise contract system, and the 
ongoing implementation of the "Regulations" for converting 
operational mechanisms. All these efforts can be regarded as 
endeavors to build up a system. 
  [Wu] The establishment of a modern enterprise system which 
has now been proposed has a clear objective, namely, the 
establishment of a modern corporate system. Only by 
establishing such an organizational system can we truly realize 
the goal of transforming the enterprise operational mechanism. 
In that case, we must be clear about what a modern corporate 
system is, or else the reform may still go out of shape. In my 
opinion, a modern company has two features: One, the company 
has a legal person status. It uses its corporate property as 
the basis for exercising its civil rights and uses its corporate 
property to undertake various obligations stipulated by the 
civil law. Two, in terms of management system, the company 
should establish one that incorporates three parties, namely, 
the shareholder general meeting, the board of directors, and the 
general manager, which check on one another. In this way, 
operational experts will be fully authorized to run the company, 
while the ownership is under ultimate restraint. The owner 
delegates the management power to the board of directors, which 
decides on broad policies and supervises the general manager and 
other executives. The general manager takes overall 
responsibility for the executive organ. These three tiers form 
a relationship of mutual balance. 
  [Lin] In that case, what is your comment on the existing 
joint-stock enterprises? 
  [Wu] There are now over 3,000 joint-stock enterprises that 
are in the experimental stage in China. Through years of 
exploration, we have gained a lot of experience. But we should 
also be aware that most experimental companies still have a long 
way to go to meet international norms. Many localities have 
been setting up joint- stock companies not for the purpose of 
changing the system, but in order to raise money or even to make 
money through speculative share deals. This is the wrong way to 
go. Therefore, we should follow the requirements of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and "rectify 
in accordance with the requirements of the norms" the existing 
companies. Naturally, however, the precondition for doing this 
job well is to get the essential point straight and have a clear 
understanding of what a modern corporate system is.

  [Text] Washington, December 30 (XINHUA) -- Despite its 
stunning economic growth, China's per capita gross national 
product (GNP) is almost at the same level of Gambia, the tiny 
country in western Africa. 
  According to The World Bank Atlas 1994, made 
public here today, China's per capita GNP grew to 380 U.S. 
dollars by the end of 1992, an increase of 10 dollars from 1991. 
  The country at almost the same level is Gambia, whose per 
capita GNP was 390 dollars last year. In terms of per capita 
GNP, China is a bit ahead of Kenya, Guyana and Equatorial 
Guinea, each at 330 dollars. 
  However, the per capita GNP growth of China, with a 
population at 1.16 billion by the end of 1992, the last 
reporting period for the atlas, has been hovering at around six 
percent from 1985 to 1992. 
  The atlas, with color maps and charts on various topics, is 
regarded as a treasure trove of information on 207 countries and 
has become an international standard in statistical compilations 
over the past 25 years. 
  As comparison, the per capita GNP for India, the second most 
populous country in the world, was 310 dollars in 1992, a 
decrease of 20 dollars from 1991. 
  Meanwhile, China's average inflation rate from 1985 to 1992 
was 7.5 percent, according to the atlas. 
  The atlas said that the total fertility rate of China, whose 
family planning policy is called "one child per couple", was 2.4 
births per woman in 1992, its infant mortality rate was 38 per 
1,000 live births. 
  However, China's primary school enrollment was a 
satisfactory 
100 percent, the atlas showed, although its illiteracy rate was 
27 percent at the time of reporting. 
  Reports from Beijing said that China's economic growth is 
expected to top 13 percent this year, as compared with 12.8 
percent last year, making China the world's fastest growing 
country. 
  According to the World Bank, those with per capita GNP at 
lower than 675 dollars are regarded as low-income countries. 
Those with income levels at between 676 and 2,695 dollars are 
called lower- middle-income countries. 
  In 1992, the atlas showed, there are 57 low-income countries 
and 69 lower-middle-income countries in the world.

Work for 1994"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec (RENMIN RIBAO)--In the last few 
days, Beijing and Shanghai Municipalities called meetings to 
relay the spirit of the national work conference and, in 
accordance with the "Decision" of the 14th party congress and 
the demands of the national economic work conference, stressed 
that we need to further emancipate minds, seize opportunities, 
and speed up reform, opening up, and modernization. Both 
municipalities made arrangements for reform and development in 
1994. 
  In the spirit of the national economic conference, Beijing 
Municipal Government made repeated studies of next year's 
economic work for the municipality and proposed that the basic 
line of thinking for next year's economic work be: Emancipate 
minds, seize opportunities, speed up reform, opening up, and 
economic development, and work hard to achieve an economic level 
in which everybody is comparatively well-off. Efforts will be 
focused, however, on the following tasks: One, speeding up the 
creation of a socialist market economic system, with emphasis on 
building a modern corporate system and a macro-regulatory 
control system; two, further expand opening up and achieve 
breakthroughs in utilizing foreign capital; three, optimize the 
production structure, raise economic returns, and maintain the 
momentum of rapid urban and rural economic growth; four, with 
the greatest determination and effort, speed up urban 
infrastructural projects; push ahead with urban and rural 
modernization; and five, exploit the advantages inherent in 
state capital and speed up scientific and technological progress 
and talent training. 
  At a class organized for party and government cadres in 
Shanghai's industrial sector to study of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and implementation of 
the spirit of the second plenary session of the municipality's 
6th CPC Central Committee, Shanghai government leaders in charge 
of industry said a few days ago that in 1994, Shanghai industry 
should have new thinking and practices in order to achieve 
breakthroughs and open a new dimension on a higher level in the 
following four areas: 
  One, breakthroughs in work on market, industrial sales value 
kept at this year's real growth rate, and an industrial 
production and sales rate over 97 percent. Two, breakthroughs 
in adjustment; vigorous development of pillar industries such as 
automobiles, telecommunications, computers, homes appliance, 
power station industries; concentration on 18 key projects, the 
total investment of which exceeds 200 million yuan or the annual 
output value of which exceeds 1 billion yuan; great increases in 
foreign capital utilization in 1994 from 1993; and setting up a 
number of large- sized business conglomerates. Three, achieve 
breakthroughs in reform; handle well the experiment of devolving 
the power of managing state-owned assets, focusing on the 
creation of an experimental modern corporate system. Four, 
achieve breakthroughs in management; promote product quality, an 
accounting system, product cost controls, competition 
mechanisms, and converging with international customs. 
  Shanghai Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren pointed out in his speech at 
the meeting that next year, Shanghai must start at a high level, 
make big contributions, achieve good quality, and develop at a 
quick pace. To tackle the job well, the following four jobs 
must done well: One, seize big markets; two, seize big 
projects; three, seize big corporations; and four, seize reform.

  [Text] Wuhan, December 30 (XINHUA) -- It will be easier for 
foreign-registered vessels from January 1 onward to travel up 
the Chang Jiang River from Shanghai. 
  The director of the Wuhan-based Chang Jiang River Harbor and 
Shipping Superintendent's Bureau, Huang Jianping, said today 
that from January 1, all vessels sailing the international 
channel would need only to stop once at the Liuhe Anchorage on 
the upper stream in Shanghai Port to get in and out of the Chang 
Jiang River. 
  Currently vessels traveling along the Chang Jiang River have 
to anchor twice, when going in at Wusong Anchorage and going out 
at Liuhe, to allow Shanghai Port pilots and those of the Chang 
Jiang Shipping Bureau to go on board. 
  Too many stops and formalities, plus the problem of the 
shrinking Wusong Anchorage due to sludge deposits, have caused 
delays to many vessels and led to complaints by shipping 
companies, the director said. 
  After a working group investigated the problem, the Ministry 
of Communications recently approved the new scheme. 
  While improving the traffic and telecommunications at the 
Liuhe Anchorage, the director said that his bureau would also 
seek to expand the anchorage by 30 percent to allow 15 vessels 
of 30,000 dwt [deadweight tonnage] to anchor simultaneously.

  [Text] Beijing, December 31 (CNS) -- This year has seen 
the biggest ever investment in railway construction and the 
greatest length of new railways in China's history, according to 
the Ministry of Railways. 
  By the end of November, 53 medium- and large-scale rail 
construction projects saw investment of RMB [renminbi] 16.06 
billion, three times as much as for the same period last year. 
Work done for these projects included 150 million cubic metres 
of road-bed, 88,000 metres of tunnels, 160,000 metres of medium- 
and large-scale bridges and some 1,655.2 kilometres of 
track-laying. 
  The initial stage of the Beijing-Kowloon railway has 
proceeded smoothly with 1,360 kilometres of the roadbed being 
laid by the end of November, 84 percent of the total length 
while 532 kilometres of track, one-third the total length, has 
been laid. 
  The second-phase project of the Daqin railway and the 
double- 
track project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway have passed 
inspection while electrification of the Zhangxia section of the 
Yingtan-Xiamen railway has also been completed.

<F P=106> ["1993 Yearender" by staff correspondent Qin Jingwu (4440 </F>
0079 0582): "China's Rapidly Developing Energy Industry"] 
  [Text] China's sustained, rapid, healthy economic growth 
has made greater demands on the energy industry and is 
encouraging it to look for breakthroughs. 
<H3>  Petroleum: Opening to the Outside World and Involvement in 
Multinational Operations </H3>
  By the end of November, the China National Petroleum 
Corporation had produced 127 million tonnes of crude oil, up 
1.38 percent from the same period last year, and 141 million 
cubic meters of natural gas, up 3.6 percent from the same period 
last year. In recent years, to speed up petroleum industrial 
development, China has opened the southeastern part of the Tarim 
Basin, Xinjiang, and part of the East China Sea to prospecting 
by foreign petroleum firms. More than a dozen big firms from a 
number of countries signed up to bid for these two regions. Ten 
contracts have been signed on the East China Sea and one on the 
Tarim Basin, signalling another breakthrough in the China's 
petroleum industry's opening up to the outside world. 
  Another breakthrough this year: The China National Petroleum 
and Natural Gas Corporation stepped out of the country to engage 
in multinational oil and natural gas operations. Since 
October, the corporation has signed four overseas oil contracts 
and accords with Peru, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand. 
So China is not only attracting foreign firms to prospect its 
land and seas; its petroleum industry has also gone out of the 
country in oil and natural gas prospecting. 
<H5>  Electric Power: Strive for Sustained and Accelerated Growth </H5>
  China's electric power industrial growth rates have been 
astounding to the world. Since 1988, China increased its 
installed generating capacity by 12 million kw, though power 
supply remains short compared with its recent 20 percent 
industrial growth rate. To ease power shortages as soon as 
possible, the Ministry of Power Industry has decided to increase 
financing and use of foreign funds for the power industry. From 
now on, investment in the expansion and reproduction of the 
power industry will take up another 25 percent over and above 
its present proportion in the GDP. By the end of this century, 
China's installed generating capacity will have increased from 
the current 240 million kw to 310 million kw, which is expected 
to basically ease the power shortage across the country. 
  This year, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang 
progressed to the design and production stage, and the first 
generator unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong 
started generating power for electric grids this year, 
signalling a new dimension for China's nuclear-powered 
electricity. 
<H5>  Coal: Diversified Operating Modes, Move Toward the Market </H5>
  Coal accounts for over 70 percent of China's primary energy 
structure and is vital. The state has decided to deregulate raw 
coal prices and stop subsidizing its production in the near 
future. State-owned coal mines are facing grim challenges. On 
the basis of its diversified modes of operations, the coal 
industry is quickening its move toward the market. The average 
output value of coal production under diversified operations 
between 1986 and 1991 annually rose 25 percent and by the end of 
last year, the diversified part of the industry was employing 
1.45 million people, generating 15 billion yuan in output value, 
which is expected to hit 18 billion, and absorbing 150,000 
people made redundant by staff cutting. The diversified 
operating part of the coal industry has generated more than 20 
different trades, set up close to 20,000 operating units and 
factories and a number of Sino-foreign joint ventures or jointly 
invested ventures. The development of diversified operations 
has contributed to stabilizing raw coal production and reversing 
losses in state-owned coal mines.

record 143.8 million tons of oil this year. 
  Output of both onshore and offshore oilfields has increased 
this year, further enhancing China's position among the major 
oil producers in the world. 
  By December 27, the China National Oil and Gas Corporation 
had produced 139.2 million tons of oil, an increase of 1.04 
million tons in output over last year. The China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation, which controls all China's offshore 
oilfields, had boosted output by 730,000 tons to 4.6 million 
tons. 
  The country has discovered a number of big oil and natural 
gas deposits, which will enable China to further increase its 
oil output next year.

  [Text] [Video opens with a reporter speaking into a 
microphone outside a white factory building] Viewers: China 
Hualu Electronic Limited Company -- our country's first large 
modern enterprise that develops and produces internal parts for 
videocassettee recorders, VCR's -- formally went into operation 
in Dalian on 28 December. 
  The Hualu project, which commenced on 1 August 1992, carries 
a total investment of 1.6 billion renminbi. State Council 
leaders once evaluated the project as a leader in terms of 
imported technology, interprovincial and intercity shareholding 
and joint investment, and construction speed. Aiming at high 
levels and high standards of construction, China Hualu 
Electronic Limited Company has imported production technology, 
equipment, and development skills from Japan's Matsushita 
Corporation. With imported production processes, the overall 
equipment automation rate has been raised to more than 80 
percent. There are approximately 500 mechanical arms on 
production lines. The company has brought the processing 
accuracy of precision components to within the range of microns. 
Imported development processes include core and structural 
parts and C1-D and C1-M mould design and development technology. 
China Hualu Electronic Limited Company's first-stage project is 
capable of producing 1.5 million internal parts annually. 
Beginning next year, VCR's made of locally-produced internal 
parts will be marketed in large quantities. A strong foundation 
will thus be laid for the development of our country's VCR 
industry. [video shows people looking at equipment and 
machinery inside the factory, female workers in white caps and 
jackets on a production line, Hu Qili in a dark Western business 
suit being briefed by a factory foreman, and automated machinery

  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Minister Hu, what do you think 
are China Hualu's successes? 
  [Hu Qili] There are two aspects. First, Hualu's successes 
have set a good example of jointly setting up an enterprise 
group. They also offer new experience in overcoming 
disorganization and disorderliness in the electronic industry. 
Second, in importing advanced foreign technology, Hualu has 
established a research and development center to bolster its own 
research and development capability. I think this is a very 
far-sighted move. An enterprise would be void of vitality if it 
did not possess research and development capability. Were this 
the case, we would be in a state of dependency under which we 
would have to import foreign equipment for successive 
generations. [end recording] [Video shows the reporter 
speaking to Hu Qili and then thrusting her microphone toward Hu, 
who speaks while standing and folding his arms behind his back. 
An on-screen caption reads: Minister of Electronics Industry 
Hu Qili. Video then shows a wide shot of the gleaming factory 
premises, automated carts sliding across the factory floor, and 
workers operating machinery inside the factory.]

  [Text] Panzhihua, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China is to step 
up the exploitation of vanadium and titanium resources in its 
southwestern part through absorbing more overseas funds and 
technology. 
  The resources are concentrated in an area called Panzhihua 
in 
Sichuan Province. More funds will be poured into the renovation 
project of an existing titanium separation plant, which is 
capable of producing 100,000 tons of titanium concentrate a 
year, and a titanium dioxide extraction plant. 
  By the year 2000 the annual output of titanium concentrate 
will reach 300,000 tons and that of titanium dioxide, 25,000 
tons. A high-grade titanium extraction plant will also be built 
to further process the 300,000 tons of titanium concentrate into 
100,000 tons of high-grade titanium slag, according to the 
development blueprint. 
  In addition, more vanadium extraction plants will be built 
by 
the end of this century in a bid to produce 100,000 tons of 
vanadium slag and 22,000 tons of vanadium pentoxide a year. 
  Qin Wanxiang, mayor of Panzhihua, told XINHUA that the city 
is co-operating with some domestic research institutes to study 
ways to extract from tailings scandium, which, like vanadium and 
titanium, is widely used in the space, electronics, 
petrochemical and medical industries. 
  Statistics show that more than 20 million tons of vanadium, 
or 63 percent of China's total reserves, and 890 million tons of 
titanium, or 93 percent of China's total titanium reserves, are 
located in the Panzhihua area. 
  The vanadium deposit is the third-largest and that of 
titanium is the largest in the world. 
  Twenty-eight years of construction have made Panzhihua a 
medium- sized city and the largest metallurgical center in 
southwest China. Products including high-grade iron and steel, 
vanadium slag and titanium concentrate have been exported to 
Japan, Southeast Asia and Europe. 
  However, due to the small scale of technology and investment 
so far, the utilization of vanadium and titanium is still in the 
primary stage, according to the mayor. The products are mainly 
sold as low-grade raw materials and the production capacity is 
low. 
  Qin said that the Ertan hydroelectric power station on the 
Yalong river, which is expected to be completed by the year 
2000, will provide sufficient electricity for the new 
development plan.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China has 
maintained the high-speed growth momentum of its tourist 
industry this year, which earned record sums of foreign 
currencies. 
  The industry welcomed a total of 40 million overseas 
tourists 
and reaped a record 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange 
by the end of the year, up 4.9 percent and 16.5 percent 
respectively over the 1992 figure. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, a high-ranking official of the 
State Administration of Tourism said that China now ranks 17th 
in the world in terms of foreign exchange earnings from tourism, 
dramatically up from the 41st place 15 years ago. 
  To ensure steady growth in the booming tourism, the 
government has urged the country's tourism institutions and 
agencies to take harsh measures next year to curb random charges 
on overseas tourists surcharged by guides and drivers who 
pressurize tourists into shopping and thus receive commissions. 
  The official said that the government will strictly forbid 
hotels and restaurants catering for foreigners to receive sales 
commission or brokerage of any kind through dealing with tourist 
groups. They should supply the exact food to the tourists as 
ordered under the contract. No unauthorized changes should be 
made in the diet. 
  The official said that the relevant departments should also 
pay great attention to improving toilet sanitation at scenic 
spots, about which overseas tourists complain most. 
  Moreover, according to the official, the relevant government 
departments will take tougher and more effective measures to 
crack down on such illegal activities as prostitution, gambling 
and drug taking, and to punish severely people who connive at 
such behavior. 
  As for Chinese citizens who are to go abroad for 
sightseeing, 
the state tourism departments will map out plans for such 
visits, the official added.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- The puzzle of how 
China, with less than 10 percent of the world's arable land, 
manages to feed about one fifth of the population of the globe, 
prompted Aziadomi Kogblevi to come to China. 
  Kogblevi, an adviser on technology and development of 
agriculture and forestry of Benin, a small African country, was 
just one of swarms of foreign visitors to probe China`s 
agricultural success. 
  The year of 1993 has seen a China brisk in agricultural 
exchanges with the outside world. 
  "The Ministry of Agriculture has received delegations from 
such countries as Senegal, Jordan, Mexico, Myanmar (the former 
Burma), Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Cuba, and the United States 
this year," said Jin Shisheng, an official responsible for 
international cooperation in the ministry. 
  "Prominent among the visitors was American Agricultural 
Minister Mike Espy," Jin said. "He was the first American 
cabinet member touring China since Clinton took power. 
  "He was also the first American agricultural minister coming 
to China since the establishment of the Sino-American joint 
working group on technological cooperation in agriculture in 
1980." 
  Espy's visit was considered "the new starting point for 
Sino- 
American agricultural cooperation," Jin said. 
  Another important figure was Arturo Gusman Pascual, the 
chairman of the Cuban Price Commission, who was authorized by 
Fidel Castro, Cuba's top leader, to have a thorough look at the 
booming agriculture here. 
  Meanwhile, 4,400 Chinese people have been sent abroad for 
the 
purpose of investigation, training and promotion of trade this 
year. 
  He Kang, China's former minister of agriculture, visited 
Japan and later went to India where he found both sides were 
interested in exchanges of sources of seeds and science and 
technology. 
  The visit of incumbent Minister Liu Jiang to Israel scored 
rich achievements: the setting up of a joint commission of 
agriculture and the signing of a memorandum between the two 
agricultural ministries. 
  Scientific communications and economic cooperation in 
agriculture have been given a strong impetus with these busy 
exchanges. 
  So far China has fostered scientific and economic relations 
with 114 countries and almost all the international agricultural 
organizations and institutions, while involving itself in many 
important agricultural activities. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture has reaped as much as 83.5 
million U.S. dollars worth of aid this year, up 20 percent on 
1992, with which Germany and Australia will help China in the 
fields of bringing up fine breeds of pigs and dairy cows and 
protection of dry land. 
  World Food Program offered China 13 million U.S. dollars 
worth of food aid gratis, and the United Nations Food and 
Agricultural Organization approved programs costing over 6 
million U.S. dollars for preserving fresh fruit and fish. 
  The U.N. Development Program also sanctioned this year "the 
Development Plan in Northwest China", worth of 8.59 million U.S. 
dollars, consisting of six projects. 
  In order to strengthen China's cooperation with the U.N. 
Food 
and Agricultural Organization [FAO], Minister Liu Jiang attended 
the FAO's 27th conference, held in Italy this year. 
  China was also a participant in the World Agricultural 
Development Foundation's 16th conference on management, and was 
elected a member of the organization's executive bureau. 
  In September, at the 49th meeting of the executive bureau, a 
project covering agricultural development in Yunnan, a remote 
province in southwest China, was ratified, and a preferential 
loan of 25.79 million U.S. dollars was promised to China.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China will make 
big efforts to achieve a sustained increase in farm production 
and farmers' incomes, said Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, he said that to meet the demand 
of national economic reform and development in 1994, the reform 
of the farm production structure must be enhanced so as to 
ensure a steady increase in cotton, food and oil production. 
  He also said that efforts should be redoubled to accelerate 
the development of stock breeding, aquatic and vegetable 
production to provide more and better non-staple food for urban 
people. 
  The development of township enterprises should be focused on 
raising economic returns, he added. 
  Liu said that his ministry has made a decision to put into 
full play the role of the ministry's macro economic control, by 
strengthening the building of the information system, improving 
the legal system, expanding capital construction and fostering a 
contingent of people with farming technical skills.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Various Localities Act Promptly To </F>
Curb Grain Prices; People Are Reassured, Grain Prices Are 
Declining"] 
  [Text] Over the past few days, the Chinese Government has 
taken emergency measures to curb the recent sharp rise of grain 
prices in various localities. As a result of the timely and 
powerful intervention, grain prices in these localities have 
tended to decline, and people's sentiments have stabilized. 
This newspaper's reporters stationed on the mainland yesterday 
sent the following reports on the grain conditions and public 
feelings from various localities. 
<H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Kung Shuang-yin (7255 7175 0603) 
From Beijing </H3>
  The Beijing Municipal Government has adopted measures to 
check grain prices and stabilize commodity prices over the last 
few days. The municipal government called an emergency meeting 
at which Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC 
Committee, attended and made a speech. After the meeting, four 
working groups led by Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing 
Municipality, Zhang Jianmin, chairman of the Beijing Municipal 
People's Congress Standing Committee, and other leaders 
inspected local conditions on carrying out various measures to 
curb the prices of grain, edible oil, vegetables, eggs, and pork. 
  There has been wide coverage in the mainland's newspapers, 
television programs, and broadcasts over the last few days 
concerning the conditions of curbing grain prices in various 
localities across the country. 
  An authoritative source pointed out: It is necessary to 
learn to regulate and control grain prices in markets with 
market economic measures. When it is necessary to sell grain in 
large quantities, the state must do it, and the same is the case 
with purchases. The greater fluctuations the grain price is 
undergoing, the more necessary it is to resolutely break through 
regional blockades and guard against trade monopolies. 
  In accordance with economic experts' proposals, the state 
has 
adopted stringent measures to curb grain prices. 
  According to a source here, following the macroeconomic 
regulation and control measures adopted by the state, the rising 
tendency of grain prices has been controlled and even dropped to 
a certain extent. 
<H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Ho Sui-yi (0149 4482 1837) From 
Guangzhou </H3>
  The people in Guangzhou, where control over grain prices was 
lifted long ago, faced the recent national situation of grain 
price fluctuation with a collective presence of mind. After the 
agitation of "rushing to buy rice for fear of its possible price 
rise" in the latter half of last month, the public feelings have 
stabilized now and the situation of grain markets has returned 
to normal. 
  Explaining the reasons that caused the fluctuation in grain 
purchasing, a relevant person responsible for Guangzhou's 
Commercial Committee said: News has spread that the state will 
raise the grain procurement price, which has been on the low 
side, as of next March -- the beginning of a new fiscal year for 
grain. As a result, peasants have been reluctant to sell their 
grain in the current harvest season, hoping that they will be 
able to sell it at a higher price after the state's 
readjustment. Now is precisely the time for various localities 
and cities to fulfill their tasks of procuring and storing 
public grain, thus causing some tension in supply and demand as 
there were strong demands on one hand and reluctant sales on the 
other. 
  Under the above circumstances, the overall grain price in 
Guangzhou, where the practice of price fluctuation in line with 
market conditions has been in effect for a long time, increased 
by 30 percent over the first half of this year, and the price of 
quality rice rose by a larger margin, though the price of 
standard rice maintained the level of 1 to 1.20 yuan per jin. 
But the Guangzhou people, who are accustomed to eating quality 
rice, still wanted to store a few bags of quality rice at home, 
as prompted by the mentality of "storing up grain against 
famine." As a consequence, the agitation of rushing to buy rice 
occurred a short time ago. 
  The Guangzhou Grain Bureau has taken measures to ensure a 
sufficient stock of rice and edible oil in various grain shops 
throughout the city and to increase the supply of rice in 
greater varieties. Grain shops are prohibited from taking 
advantage of market demands to raise grain prices. Besides, the 
city's Administration for Industry and Commerce has been 
requested to exercise supervision over private rice stalls. 
  When asked whether or not the method of rationing grain and 
edible oil will be employed, the source from the Commercial 
Committee indicated that "it would not consider reusing the 
typical method of the planned economy," and that "it was 
absolutely unnecessary to backtrack by practicing the old system 
as there is sufficient grain in stock in Guangzhou, and numerous 
and convenient supply centers." 
<H5>  Report by Staff Reporter Kan Ku (1626 6253) From Shanghai </H5>
  Like other cities on the mainland, the wind of 
panic-purchasing and hoarding of rice also engulfed Shanghai 
recently, so that long shopping queues with up to hundreds of 
people, which have not been seen for years, were seen in front 
of grain shops again. In some densely populated residential 
areas, grain shops were unable to close their doors at the end 
of business hours due to the small number of grain shops and 
large number of buyers. 
  The government here has determined to resolve the problem by 
informing the people that it is not necessary to buy and hoard 
grain as there are adequate supplies, instructing the 
state-owned grain shops to refuse to sell grain to big buyers 
and peddlers, and turning on a green light to all the 
grain-carrying trucks so that they can go freely through all 
city districts even in daytime. In this way the wind of panic 
purchasing and hoarding of rice in Shanghai has subsided. 
<H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Yang Hsiao-yang (2799 1420 3152) 
From Fuzhou </H3>
  The State Council has decided to put 5 billion jin of grain 
into markets in the near future, of which 100 million jin of 
unprocessed grain will be transferred to Fujian. In this 
regard, the Fujian Provincial Government has adopted appropriate 
emergency measures to ensure the proper arrangements of grain in 
Fujian's markets in light of the present market conditions. 
  It has been reported that the grain production in Fujian 
this 
year has been normal. Up to 20 December, the entire province 
has fulfilled the annual task by 73 percent, with only 540 
million jin unfulfilled. However, there is a considerably large 
proportion of people who are still short of grain in quite a few 
disaster-hit rural areas. It is anticipated that a population 
of 4.46 million will be wanting in grain before the harvest next 
year and the grain shortage will come to 800 million jin. Among 
them, there is a "double shortage" population of 1.18 million 
for whom 140 million jin of grain should be provided. The 
provincial grain departments have indicated that they will 
conscientiously shoulder the responsibility of dealing with 
emergency rescue and providing disaster relief, make proper 
arrangements for the people's lives in the disaster-stricken 
areas before and after the Spring Festival, and stabilize the 
rural markets while trying to be well-acquainted with the 
disaster conditions. 
  Shi Xingmou, vice governor of Fujian Province, recently 
called for relevant departments to transfer the exact volume of 
100 million jin of unprocessed grain from Jiangxi to Fujian as 
arranged, so as to replenish the stock and sell out at suitable 
time. 
<H5>  Report by Staff Reporter Shao Kan (6730 1626) From Changchun </H5>
  Jilin Province, which has wrested the second highest grain 
yield ever this year, has adopted various measures to accelerate 
the progress of storing grain purchased by order so that 90 
percent of such grain has been stored, and to check grain prices 
in an effort to protect peasants' enthusiasm in selling grain so 
that the grain price of the entire province has been relatively 
stable with a slight increase. 
  According to the analysis of the provincial grain 
department, 
the situation in which the state has made funds available for 
purchasing grain at negotiated prices and peasants have made 
grain available for sales has emerged at present. The vast 
number of peasants are reluctant to sell their grain because 
they are optimistic about the quality of grain this year as its 
moisture content is generally lower than previous years, and 
they are not anxious to sell their grain for the easier handling 
of the stock. Another reason is that peasants have more money 
in hand due to their noticeable increase of revenue as a result 
of the expanded area of cash crops in Jilin this year. 
  In a bid to curb grain prices, the Jilin Provincial 
Government is taking effective measures to give positive 
guidance to intensifying management of the grain market and 
guarding against speculative acts in grain. Aiming at peasants' 
reluctance to sell grain, the government has also done 
meticulous work to protect their initiative and raise grain 
prices appropriately. 
<H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Liu Wen-yan (0491 2429 5333) From 
Shenyang </H3>
  As grain prices in various southern localities were rising 
one after another, the price in northeast China was as stable as 
usual. In Shenyang, a city and economic and cultural center in 
northeast China, grain prices did not rise, the people were not 
"panic- stricken," and their general mood was stable. 
  "When something happens, people will not be alarmed and 
confused so long as they have grain in hand." This year, there 
was an extraordinary bumper harvest in Liaoning, with the total 
yield reaching 32 billion kg, the highest in history. The 
Shenyang City Government has put in a lot of time and energy in 
grasping the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects with very 
satisfactory results. Now it has enough, and even surplus grain 
and vegetables. This is an important factor of stabilizing 
grain price in Shenyang. 
  However, pork prices rose in the last few days, as lean pork 
and pork without skin and bone rose from 4.5 to six yuan and 
three to four yuan per 500 grams respectively. An authoritative 
person said: This is partly because the sales volume of pork has 
increased owing to the peak consumption period now and partly 
because some pig- raising households would not sell their pigs, 
having anticipated a further price rise with the New Year and 
Spring Festival drawing near.

  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China is to channel 
more funds into rural capital construction next year, a Chinese 
official said here today. 
  Chen Yaobang, deputy minister of the State Planning 
Commission, said so when speaking of how the planning 
departments can better serve the development of the national 
rural economy in the coming year. 
  He said that to develop the rural economy, the planning 
departments should study the law of the market economy, perform 
the function of macro-control, and encourage the hundreds of 
millions of farmers to take part in market competition. 
  He also pointed out that an increasing effort should be made 
to handle the problems of the disparity between eastern and 
western China, and between rural and urban people, as well as 
the problem of the price scissors of industrial and agricultural 
products. 
  At the same time, he added, emphasis should be placed on the 
reasonable distribution of the productive forces in order to 
enhance the building of the rural commodity bases. 
  The deputy minister disclosed that the total amount of 
investment that the government plans to put into capital 
construction of agriculture, forestry, water control and 
meteorology next year will be much larger than this year. 
  He said that attention should be paid to the following eight 
points in developing the national rural economy. 
  The ninth five-year plan for China's agriculture must be 
worked out in accordance with the outline program of China's 
agricultural development in the 1990s, he said. 
  He stressed that emphasis should be on giving support to the 
economic development of the grain and cotton producing areas. 
  Next year, he said, the state will begin to offer special 
loans to develop of 500 commodity grain production centers and 
150 cotton production centers. 
  He said that efforts will be made to promote the 
experimental 
farming projects with high output, top quality and good economic 
returns. 
  The government will provide aid to help rural economic 
development, the development of township enterprises in 
particular, of central and western China, he said. 
  He added that great importance should be attached to the 
construction of water conservancy, afforestation and desert 
control projects. 
  The construction of the service system for production, trade 
and sale of farm products should also be strengthened, the 
official said. 
  Efforts will be redoubled to invigorate the state-owned 
forest enterprises and state farms, and to support the poor and 
remote areas and the areas suffering from natural disasters to 
develop their local economy.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yonghong: "China's Fish Output </F>
Increases This Year"] 
  [Text] Annual fishery output is expected to increase 10 
percent this year, the Ministry of Agriculture announced 
yesterday. 
  "This year the production of offshore and inland 
fish-farming 
has for the first time outstripped marine-fishery output," said 
Zhuo Youzhan, Director-General of the Ministry's Department of 
Fishery. 
  Aquatic output from fresh water and offshore fish-farms has 
grown steadily over the past decade, Zhuo added, and this year 
will account for some 52 percent total fishery production. 
  Offshore fish-farm output increased 350,000 tons, a 24.6 
percent jump, while freshwater farm output grew 690,000 tons, up 
15.7 percent through November. Total aquatic production is 
expected to reach 17 million tons. 
  Nonetheless, the decline of marine resources hampered 
further 
increase in overseas fishing output, with this year's catch 
expected to total 530,000 tons, up only 9 percent from last 
year, Zhuo said. 
  He attributed the steady growth of aquatic production to the 
expansion of fish farms, the improved breeding of fries and 
fingerlings and the introduction of advanced skills and 
technologies in the fishery sector. 
  Fresh water fish-farm acreage benefiting from exploitation 
of 
low-lying and waterlogged lands has reached 4.2 million hectares 
in 1993, about 140,000 more than last year. 
  Thanks to an increased demand for more sophisticated species 
in light of raised living standards, Zhuo predicted that total 
aquatic production would top 18 million tons in 1994--the target 
set for 2000. 
  He warned, however, that a chain reaction caused by the 
skyrocketing price of diesel oil has seriously hindered the 
development of the seawater catching industry. 
  Many high-power ships have had to stop fishing prompting 
increasing use of small low-power ships and aggravating the 
overkill of already dwindling resources in shallower waters. 
  Insuffcient management of frie [as published] and fingerling 
importation, aquicultural water administration and monitoring of 
environmental conditions have spread some fish-depleting 
diseases this year Zhuo said.

Development Tendency"] 
  [Text]What Offensive Weapons Does China Possess? 
  If judged by absolute figures, China has a total of 
3,199,100 
(by the end of 1991) active servicemen, first in the world. 
Compared with a population of 1.17 billion, the proportion is 
not big, accounting for around 0.3 percent. Let us look at the 
proportions in other countries: The former Soviet Union, 1.9 
percent; the United States (active and reserves), 1.3 percent; 
United Kingdom, 0.59 percent; France, 0.94 percent; Germany, 
0.79 percent; Japan, 0.24 percent; and India, 0.19 percent. Of 
the eight countries mentioned, China's armed forces rank sixth. 
  In terms of potential wars during the 21st century, the 
following "advanced offensive weapons" will be deployed: 
<H5>  General Trend of Advanced Weaponry During 2000 </H5>
  1. Strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and missiles of 
mass destruction, such as intercontinental missiles, strategic 
missiles, and cruise missiles; 
  2. Space defense systems; 
  3. Aircraft carrier and their planes; 
  4. Submarines; 
  5. Bombers and fighters which have the long-range capacity 
to penetrate enemy defenses; and 
  6. Armored vehicles, such as tanks and infantry vehicles. 
  An advanced command, control, communications and information 
system (C3I) [C cubed denoted as C with superscript three] is 
required for the high-efficiency operation of the above 
weaponry. Both the United States and the former Soviet Union 
believe that C3I "is the multiplier of military strength" and 
regard development and improvement of C3I as an urgent strategic 
task in military building. Meanwhile, they have accelerated the 
pace of making conventional weapons more intelligent and 
invisible, and have vigorously developed kinetic and directional 
weapons. This is the general trend of weaponry in all countries. 
  What is the situation with the above-mentioned weaponry in 
China? The following is a brief analysis of each item: 
<H5>  What is the Situation in New Chinese Weaponry? </H5>
  1. Nuclear weapons and missiles of mass destruction. 
  Regarding limited wars, the nuclear capacity of the Chinese 
military is sufficient to check nuclear threats from its 
opponents. The offensive capacity of its ballistic missiles can 
cover almost all neighboring countries. It is thought that the 
armed forces can be equipped with cruise missiles by the year 
2000. 
  2. Space defense systems. 
  Space is today's "high border" and tomorrow's "battlefield." 
It is thought that China will lead the world in space 
technology in the 21st century. By then, China is expected to 
have its first space shuttle, which will enable China to 
establish its own space defense system, and will have improved 
its defense network composed of various underground and 
space-based facilities, and will even be able to attack flying 
objects or enemy facilities in space. 
  3. Aircraft carrier. 
  An aircraft carrier and its jets can form an all-directional 
comprehensive combat force. The aircraft carrier group is 
usually composed of the following different types of vessels: 
An aircraft carrier escorted by two cruisers, four to six 
destroyers or escort vessels, and two attack submarines. In 
order to ensure supplies, there is also a supply vessel. As a 
result, aircraft on the carrier can be offensive and defensive. 
The combined and comprehensive combat effectiveness of the 
aircraft and escort vessels prevail over the simple 
multiplication of these weapons. 
  As is known to all, China does not yet have an aircraft 
carrier or cruisers, the main components of the escort fleet. 
  Three key technologies are required to build an aircraft 
carrier: First, carrier-borne aircraft and landing and take-off 
technology; second, air defense, which includes the functions 
and development of anti-radar and intercept weapons; and third, 
the development of antisubmarine technology and removing 
underwater threats to the aircraft carrier. However, the three 
key technologies are precisely the weak point of China's defense 
industry. 
<H3>  Seize International Opportunity To Assimilate Advanced 
Technology </H3>
  China's defense industry has benefited a lot from the 
flexible diplomacy adopted by the CPC in the 1980's, which 
enabled it to obtain advanced foreign technology to improve its 
weaponry. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 
1992, Russia reduced the price of sophisticated weapons and some 
technology, which enabled the CPC to considerably improve its 
weaponry and equipment. The CPC purchased advanced Su-27 jets 
from Russia. The Su-33, an improved model of the Su-27, is a 
carrier-borne jet. It has been reported that the CPC plans to 
purchase the "Minsk" antisubmarine aircraft carrier from 
Russia's Pacific Fleet, which will serve as a research model. 
Provided that China's growing economic situation does not 
suffer serious setbacks, it is estimated that China will have 
enough financial resources and technology to build a viable 
aircraft carrier within 10 years, and will be able to render it 
combat effective within three to five years after it becomes 
operational. 
  4. Nuclear submarines. 
  China now possesses nuclear submarines, but in limited 
numbers. There are no indications so far how many more nuclear 
submarines the CPC will build. 
  5. Long-range airborne troops. 
  The "Hong 6" bombers, which the CPC now possess, is based on 
the Soviet model Tu-16, which is technically outdated and 
inferior in penetrating enemy defenses. The new generation of 
the "Jianhong 7," which is still under development, is more or 
less the same as the "Tornado," jointly developed by Britain, 
Germany, and Italy. It can penetrate enemy defenses at low 
altitudes. Equipped with air-to-air refueling equipment, it has 
a long range. It is estimated that the military will be 
equipped with the "Jianhong 7" by 1996. 
  6. Tanks and armored vehicles. 
  The rate of the CPC infantry's equipment with armored 
vehicles is not high. Troops are still equipped with outmoded 
"T-59" tanks. However, the newly developed "85 II M" tank, which 
is a rival to Russia's T-72, has gone into mass production. The 
functions of the latest "90" model surpass the T-72, but because 
of a lack of funds the tank is not yet produced in large numbers. 
<H3>  First Step Taken in Satellite Weapons and Space Warning 
Systems </H3>
  In armored equipment, it seems that the CPC is not 
interested 
in the armored infantry vehicles used by the developed 
countries. Instead, the CPC is still developing armored vehicles 
of the previous generation, which will inevitably affect the 
combat effectiveness of its ground forces. 
  Regarding command, control, communications, and information 
systems, which play an overall role and increase the efficiency 
of all types of weapons, CPC equipment in this regard functions 
relatively poorly. But it is believed that this situation will 
improve remarkably when its space technology develops to an 
extent sufficient to deploy satellite weapons and space warning 
systems. It is estimated that guided weapons will enter a 
practical stage in 2008. 
<H5>  Conventional Troops Make Preparations for Reunifying Taiwan </H5>
  As China is a defensive nation, the fundamental purpose of 
its conventional troops is to safeguard national security and 
resist foreign aggression. So far, China has no intention of 
expanding its military influence outside its territory. The 
CPC's defense is based on ground forces. The Navy is a 
relatively weak factor and it does not have the comprehensive 
combat effectiveness to undertake the strategic tasks entrusted 
by the state. Although the Air Force is not small, its quality 
is not high, aircraft categories are not complete, and its 
ability to offer air cover and support land and sea operations 
is relatively low. As pointed out previously, CPC troops 
account for only 0.3 percent of the country's population, which 
is not a big proportion. Moreover, there is still a gap in 
offensive weapons between China and the developed nations. 
Therefore, the military strength of the CPC does not exceed its 
defensive needs. In fact, there are still outstanding problems 
related to the duties performed by CPC troops to defend the 
country, such as the Nansha [Spratlys] Islands, Diaoyutai 
Islands, and the Sino-Indian border. 
  It is noteworthy that the CPC has never promised not to 
resort to force on the Taiwan question. One of the main tasks 
of its conventional troops is to make preparations in this 
regard. 
<H5>  Navy Plans Offshore Development </H5>
  The open economic policy has boosted mainland China's 
maritime exchanges and economic activities with other countries. 
Mainland China's economy is effecting a change from "internal 
trade" to "external trade." Thanks to these developments and 
changes, the security of shipping and marine communications 
lines will be increasingly important. The CPC's Navy is 
gradually developing towards the direction of enhancing its 
offshore combat effectiveness. In the next decade or so, 
China's Navy will be capable of controlling Chinese waters and 
relevant shipping routes. When necessary, the Navy will escort 
important shipping and oceanic scientific observation 
activities. By then, China will be capable of sending troops 
abroad, which will exert an influence on the world's military 
situation.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429): "Background of Reform of CPC Conscription Work"] 
  [Text] Beijing 29 Dec (HSIN PAO)--According to a well- 
informed source in Beijing, a 16 December "Internal Newsletter" 
from the CPC Central Military Commission stated that 
conscription work for Winter 1993 had already been concluded 
satisfactorily, and new recruits were continuously reporting to 
units in various places as scheduled. In this winter's 
conscription, there were some 12.6 million applicants, with some 
800,000 allowed to have health checks in the wake of their 
initial examinations. The number of new recruits who went 
underwent political examination and health checks with final 
recruitment approval was some 375,000, of which, young people 
from large and medium-sized cities accounted for 47 percent 
(greatly exceeding the original quota of 13 percent), young 
people from townships and towns accounted for 29 percent, those 
with a high school education or equivalent accounted for 62 
percent, those with a cadre family background accounted for 16 
percent, and those who were communists or Communist Youth League 
members themselves accounted for 38 percent. 
  According to the "Internal Newsletter," conscription work 
this year has been the smoothest in eight years. In the seven 
preceding years, conscription quotas in urban areas were 
fulfilled only twice, in 1988 and 1992, but the quota was 
basically not fulfilled in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991. In 
1987 and 1991 particularly, only 78 percent of the quota was 
fulfilled. Although the quota was fulfilled in 1988, the 
cultural quality was not up to requirements. In addition, 
Guangdong, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Hubei were criticized in a 
circular for their poor conscription work. This year, however, 
conscription work has been comparatively smooth in those 
provinces and cities enjoying comparatively fast economic 
development and higher living standards and cultural levels, 
such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hubei, Shandong, 
Shanghai and Beijing, and young people were competing to submit 
their applications. The number of young people in employment or 
at school applying to military institutions even doubled that of 
1985, the highest for a decade. 
<H3>  "Craze for Doing Business" Pounds At "Craze for Joining the 
Army" </H3>
  Why has conscription work been so smooth this year? Liu 
Huaqing, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee and 
concurrently Central Military Commission vice chairman, said: 
"We have done conscription work this winter by observing 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building and running the Army, 
based on China's national conditions as well as the progress of 
the times, and the principle of combining political propaganda, 
ideological education, treatment in pay and benefits as well as 
job arrangements. Facts evidence that such practice is correct. 
That is the success of reform in conscription work." He made 
the above statement at a seminar on modern warfare sponsored by 
the Air Force Advanced Military Institute on 18 December. 
  A well-informed source said that young people in mainland 
China used to have a sense of honor as well as superiority when 
enlisting in the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, and they would enjoy 
a brighter future. When their enlistment expired, they might 
continue to serve in the Army as cadres, with higher average 
wages than ordinary staffers and workers and even cadres in 
localities. Even when they were demobilized, generally better 
job arrangements were made for them, and those who originally 
came from rural areas might transfer their residence 
registration to urban areas. That being the case, young people 
vied to be enlisted. Some of them even managed to join the Army 
through their connections or the back door, and the "craze for 
joining the Army" could be found everywhere in mainland China. 
However, with the deepening of reform and opening up in the 
1980's and 1990's, especially the development of the market 
economy, there has been a repetition of the "craze for doing 
business"; many young people have made profits in business and 
have greatly improved their living standards. They have seen 
that those who joined the Army did not enjoy a brighter future 
than those who remained civilians; naturally, they changed their 
concepts and no longer believed that joining the Army was the 
best choice for the future. In addition, some young people 
learned that in recent years, the wage income of military cadres 
had gradually fallen behind staffers, workers and cadres in 
localities, and even their dependents working in coastal areas, 
special economic zones, and economically developed areas. 
Furthermore, if they were stationed at frontier posts 
characterized by hardship and remoteness, they could suffer 
psychological imbalance resulted from material differences in 
addition to possibly sacrificing their lives at any time, and 
they flinched from joining the Army. In short, the "craze for 
doing business" buffeted the "craze for joining the Army," and 
conscription work was impeded. 
<H5>  Remove Anxieties For One's Future After Enlistment </H5>
  Aiming at such conditions while dealing with the needs of 
the 
Army subject to the overall situation of aggregate national 
construction at a Central Military Commission discussion meeting 
on 1 November 1984, Deng Xiaoping indicated: "Training people 
for both military and civilian jobs is also in the general 
interest. Our Army has been doing a good job in this respect 
and has much to its credit. That's fine. The Army trains these 
people in the interests of national development, and local 
authorities will warmly welcome the trainees. Such training 
will make it easier for demobilized cadres and soldiers to be 
transferred to civilian jobs." Not long ago, when Deng Xiaoping 
learned about the difficulties in conscription work, he said: 
"Reform is also called for in conscription work; first, quality 
should be insured, and second, it is necessary to a good job of 
making arrangements for the livelihood, jobs, and housing of new 
recruits as well as officers and men in active service after 
demobilization." 
  In line with Deng Xiaoping's instruction, the Central 
Military Commission conducted reform of conscription work, and 
set out the aforesaid "principle of combining political 
propaganda, ideological education, treatment in pay and benefits 
as well as work arrangements." The spirit of this principle 
lies in the demand that it is necessary to do political and 
ideological work in conscription work, as well as resolve 
practical problems. "Treatment in pay and benefits" means a new 
recruit during his enlistment will continue to enjoy his 
original pay and benefits along with subsidies, and 
readjustments in wages and promotion will also be conducted 
according to his original work unit. "Work arrangements" means 
that when those demobilized servicemen return to work in the 
city, their wages will be set one grade higher than those of 
staffers and workers during that period, and an outstanding 
demobilized serviceman or one with a record of meritorious 
service may enjoy wages two grades higher, and all units that 
have conditions should give priority to them in the distribution 
of housing. Regarding demobilized servicemen who return to 
rural areas, prefectural and county governments should give 
priority to them in making arrangements for them to work in 
local government organizations, enterprises, and institutions 
according to their performance during their enlistment, their 
speciality, and educational background. Their wages should be 
determined with reference to the length of enlistment, and an 
additional 20 percent of the area's average annual income per 
capita would be considered appropriate; in addition, their 
relocation allowance should generally not be lower than 5,000 
yuan. 
  The aforesaid reform has succeeded in relieving young 
people's anxieties for the future after enlistment. 
Furthermore, over the past few years, units have universally 
attached importance to bringing up people for both military and 
civilian jobs in various forms, including training people on the 
job, transferring them to new posts, self-study through 
correspondence courses, and building bases for concentrated 
training in rotation, thus creating better conditions for the 
broad officers and men seeking knowledge and becoming qualified 
people as well as employment after demobilization. 
Consequently, resistance to conscription work has been greatly 
reduced over the past two years. 
<H5>  Worrying About "Defeating Oneself" </H5>
  The well-informed source added that, despite a basic 
solution 
to conscription work difficulties, the Army's political quality 
had became a conspicuous issue. Since the beginning of this 
year, senior commanders such as Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, and the director of Deng Xiaoping's 
office, Wang Ruilin, have made inspections and fact-finding 
tours of various military regions, and they all found that how 
the Army should bring forward the fine traditions and maintain 
the true colors of the old Red Army under the new situation of 
developing the socialist market economy was a serious issue. 
Old generals, including Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, and Xiao Ke 
have also written to Deng Xiaoping and the Central Military 
Commission indicating that are many problems among the troops, 
especially that there was no time to lose in resolving problems 
with the Army's political quality. 
  That being the case, the Central Military Commission and the 
General Political Department convoked a "Discussion Meeting on 
Army Ideological and Political Work" in Guangzhou in mid-May. 
In its wake, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, the two vice chairmen 
of the Central Military Commission, signed an important article 
in the 26 July issue of RENMIN RIBAO, on the eve of the 66th 
anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA], to discuss the extreme importance of the Army bringing 
forward its fine traditions under the new situation. 
  The understanding of the Army shared by the CPC top echelon 
is that the Army is facing a new test while China enters a 
period of peacetime construction with building the socialist 
market economic structure as the goal. With the development of 
the market economy, officers and men will gradually enhance 
their concepts of competition, effect [xiao yi 2400 4135], time, 
and the legal system; all this is conducive to Army 
modernization. Nevertheless, in the wake of expanding opening 
up, some decadent ideas and lifestyles will seize their 
opportunity to infiltrate the Army. These things, together with 
some remnants of feudal ideas left over from Chinese history, 
will shape into money worship, hedonism, and 
ultra-individualism, which will corrupt and erode the ideals and 
faith of the officers and men. There have been many examples in 
Chinese and foreign history where armies became lordly, luxury- 
loving, lax, and idle, indulged in pleasure, and lost their 
combat effectiveness under a peaceful environment, which was 
shrouded in an atmosphere of singing and dancing to extol the 
good times, with civil officials indolent and military officials 
frivolous. Consequently these armies were defeated by peace, and 
themselves. We must draw lessons from this to avoid the 
repetition of such a tragedy. 
  In actual fact, Deng Xiaoping advised the military top 
echelons on the eve of the 14th CPC Congress in October 1992 
that the Army must bring forth its fine traditions and maintain 
the Red Army's true color. In the wake of the 14th CPC 
Congress, Chairman Jiang Zemin of the Central Military 
Commission gave a systematic discussion on the PLA's fine 
traditions, which he generalized into 10 aspects. However, the 
value concepts of officers and men vary today; under conditions 
where the spirit of hard struggle and selfless devotion is being 
eroded, it is difficult to continue education in tradition. 
Western strategists are expressing doubt about the combat 
effectiveness of the PLA, which is now "looking forward to 
money," and believe that should such a trend continue, worse 
than that could happen. 
  It has been learned that the Central Military Commission has 
already set forth that "arming the thinking of the broad 
officers and men" with Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory is the 
basic task of political work in the Army; at the same time, the 
improvement of conditions and administration will be 
supplemented so that officers and men might establish the 
correct outlook on life, values, and ethical concepts. 
Nevertheless, some military cadres who have a good inside 
knowledge of the military have expressed their doubts about the 
effectiveness of such an approach on the grounds that corrupt 
phenomena have already become far too serious!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Basic Norms Concerning Building Army </F>
Grass-Roots Units in New Period"] 
  [Text] The Central Military Commission [CMC] decided to 
promulgate the "Outline of Army Building at the Grass-Roots 
Level," revised by the General Staff Headquarters, the General 
Political Department, and the General Logistics Department, for 
trial implementation in the entire Army. This is a major move 
by the CMC and the general departments for intensifying the army 
building of the grass-roots units in order to suit the new 
situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure 
and to meeting the demands of the Army's modernization. 
  The leading CMC cadres take the building of the grass-roots 
units seriously. After the 14th National Party Congress, the 
CMC explicitly pointed out: In order to meet the requirements 
of the new situation, it is necessary to revise the "Outline" so 
as to raise the building of the grass-roots units to a new 
level. In line with the CMC instructions, the three general 
departments have conducted substantial work in investigation and 
demonstration and have fully heeded and assimilated opinions 
from various quarters. The revised "Outline" takes Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period as 
guidance.It takes Chairman Jiang Zemin's overall requirement of 
being "qualified politically, proficient militarily, fine in 
style, strict in discipline, and adequate in maintenance and 
supplies" as a foundation; and the enhancement of the Army's 
combat capacity as the fundamental purpose to fully reflect the 
instructions and guidelines of the CMC and the 14th National 
Party Congress.It inherits and develops the fine tradition of 
our Army, maintains the strong points of the original "Outline," 
and sums up and absorbs the fresh experiences in army building 
at the grass-roots levels over the last few years. As a basic 
norm and foundation for the building, the revised "Outline" 
definitely standardizes its criteria, principal tasks, methods 
of examination and appraisal through comparison, as well as 
principal duties and requirements of organs at various levels 
which are responsible for the grass-roots units. The 
promulgation and trial implementation of the "Outline" will 
provide a more definite direction, clearer ideas of work, and a 
more perfect incentive mechanism for the building of the 
grass-roots units. It will also straighten out the relations 
between leading organs and grass-roots units. All this will 
play a major role in, and produce a momentous impact on the 
building of the grass-roots units in the new period. This will 
repeatedly push forward the building of a revolutionized, 
modernized, and regularized Army. 
  Guiding and standardizing the building of the grass-roots 
units in line with the overall requirement of being "qualified 
politically, proficient militarily, fine in style, strict in 
discipline, and adequate in maintenance and supplies" as 
proposed by Chairman [zhu xi 0031 1598] Jiang Zemin, is the core 
substance and most striking characteristic of the revised 
"Outline." Chairman Jiang's requirement in five aspects is a 
summary of the major contents of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking on army building in the new period. It is a 
concentrated reflection of the objective laws governing army 
building in the new period. This is an overall requirement for 
army building as well as for the building of the grass-roots 
units. The building of the grass-roots units is systems 
engineering, which is complicated and difficult to put into 
effect. Hence, stress should be put on building in the above 
five aspects. If we guide and standardize the building of the 
grass-roots units with Chairman Jiang's instructions, we will be 
able to give impetus to all fields of endeavor in order to 
promote the comprehensive building. We should deeply understand 
the significance of guiding and standardizing this building with 
the above instructions in the areas including: the direction of 
the building, the formation of the Army's fighting capacity, and 
the performance of its basic functions. On this basis, we 
should command and standardize the building of the grass-roots 
units. 
  The major content of the revised "Outline" stresses the 
seven 
principal regular missions for the grass-roots units, which are 
all basic and long-term tasks. If these tasks are well 
performed, we will be able to administer strict discipline to 
the Army, implement the principles of intensifying the 
comprehensive building of the grass-roots units, and provide a 
reliable guarantee for the fulfillment of Chairman Jiang's 
instructions, so that the Army will be able to stand the trials 
under various complex conditions. In a bid to intensify the 
building of the grass-roots units, it is necessary to always 
take firm, regular, and continuous control of the seven 
principal regular missions stipulated in the "Outline," with 
efforts really concentrated on the building of a basic and 
regular character. With regard to specific Army units, 
particular emphasis should be laid on a certain aspects of the 
tasks but, generally speaking, we should have in mind building 
in a comprehensive way and persistently hold fast to the seven 
principal missions so that they will coordinate with and promote 
one another in making advances. 
  It is another major point of the revised "Outline" to 
universally strive to become advanced companies and excellent 
soldiers throughout the entire Army. Summing up the 
activities of appraisal through comparison previously conducted 
in the grass-roots units, the "Outline" stipulates that such 
activities be launched throughout the entire Army in a unified 
manner and determine their specific practices. These activities 
developed under the new situation, and reflect the aspirations 
of the vast number of officers and men in the grass-roots units 
of the entire Army and play an extremely inspiring 
role,developing into a vigorous and lively situation wherein 
everyone is emulating, learning from, catching up with, and 
helping one another striving to become an advanced element. In 
line with the requirements of the "Outline," we should 
straighten out our ideas, organize and guide our work in a 
scientific and meticulous manner, have the mobilization of 
positive factors, promotion of work, implementation, and 
intensification of the comprehensive building in mind. We must 
pay attention to overcoming and guarding against such problems 
as formalism, scholasticism, and so on, which were liable to 
emerge in the previous appraisals and contests, so that the 
activities will embark on a solid, effective, and healthy path 
of development from the very beginning. 
  In carrying out the "Outline," leading organs should 
shoulder 
their major responsibilities. The "Outline" has made explicit 
stipulations on the principal duties and basic requirements of 
the leading organs at all levels in charge of the grass-roots 
units, as well as on the style of thinking and work style that 
they should adopt. Leading organs at all levels should comply 
with the requirements of the "Outline," intensify their 
self-building, and provide guidance and service to the 
grass-roots units. At present, they must first study the 
"Outline" seriously, acquire a good grasp of its main substance, 
increase their sense of responsibility, go into the midst of the 
troops to conduct propaganda, and give proper guidance to the 
study of the troops. Divisions, battalions, and regiments 
should train their grass-roots cadres and office workers with 
the "Outline" in a planned way. Units above army level should 
conscientiously hold fast to the selected sites for experiments 
and give proper guidance to the work in the pilot units. It is 
imperative to handle affairs strictly according to the 
stipulations and requirements of the "Outline," and, at the same 
time, combine implementation of the "Outline" with the pertinent 
rules and regulations. Leading cadres at all levels should 
conduct thorough investigations and studies, give concrete 
guidance and assistance to organs and grass-roots units in their 
implementation of the "Outline," keep abreast of the new 
situation and problems which emerge in the course of 
implementation, and sum up and acquaint themselves with the 
newly gained experiences. Through solid and effective work, a 
lively situation in which leading organs give guidance and 
assistance to grass-roots units and grass-roots units intensify 
their own building according to the "Outline" will certainly 
emerge. The building of the grass-roots units will be pushed 
forward constantly.

  [Text]A clash between soldiers and officers over 
leave approval killed and wounded a number of people and shocked 
the Central Military Commission. There had been resentment 
among the troops and the incident was an eruption of a long-term 
contradiction. 
  In mid-November 1993, turmoil broke out in an anti-chemical- 
warfare company of the 3d Division of the Anhui Military 
District and Huainan Military Subarea, leaving five officers and 
soldiers dead, all from gunshots. Military notices pointed out 
that it was an incident of political turmoil, caused by 
anarchism and developing into opposition to military discipline 
and leadership. The Central Military Commission General Office 
cited a report by a General Staff Headquarters investigative 
group as saying: This was a criminal act that seriously 
disrupted military discipline. 
<H3>  Unfair Leave Approval Left Soldiers Dissatisfied and 
Complaining </H3>
  In early November, officers and soldiers of an 
anti-chemical- 
warfare company all applied for two-day weekend leave for a 
pleasure tour of Huainan City. The battalion command rejected 
their applications and told two company-level cadres to make 
preparations for a military exercise with live ammunition at 
Luanshan the following week, which was the reason company 
soldiers were not allowed leave. However, that weekend the 
company commander and the deputy commander approved a tour by 
three platoon commanders and some 40 soldiers of Huainan City, 
but rejected the same request by 40 other soldiers. The company 
commander said: It was the battalion command that approved the 
leave of some platoon commanders and soldiers. On Sunday 
morning, when the regimental and battalion commanders discovered 
in their barracks inspection that 40 people had obtained 
approval for a Huainan City tour, they demanded an explanation. 
Meanwhile, officers and soldiers whose leave applications were 
rejected refused to eat their breakfast and questioned the 
regimental and battalion commanders: Why grant holiday trips to 
some and not others? The 40-odd officers and soldiers 
surrounded the regimental and battalion commanders. Some 
started shouting slogans: We want fairness, justice, rest, 
entertainment; we oppose bureaucratism.... The battalion 
commander read aloud sections of military discipline before 
these soldiers, ordered them to leave and return to barracks, 
and instructed the company commander to make a self-criticism, 
find out who instigated the slogan-chanting, and report the 
findings to the battalion command. 
<H3>  During the Commotion, the Company Commander and Instructor 
Were Beaten to Death </H3>
  By noon that day, some 40 officers and soldiers had 
collectively petitioned the regimental command for retirement 
and going home, shouting: "We want to retire and go home!" 
"Officers and soldiers join hands in opposing brutality!" The 
regimental commander notified cadres of the company to take back 
the petitioning soldiers. In the meantime, the soldiers again 
shouted slogans such as: "We don't want the crooked company 
commander," and "replace the vagabond company commander." The 
situation was getting out of hand. The company commander fired 
warning shots and told the soldiers to return to barracks, 
shouting: "Damn you, my bullets do not recognize anybody..." 
Furious, the soldiers rushed forward and grabbed his gun. The 
deputy company commander and the company instructor fired at 
soldiers leading the slogan chanting, and the regimental and 
battalion commanders also fired warning shots in the air. In 
the commotion three soldiers were killed; the company commander 
and instructor were beaten to death [as published]; the deputy 
company commander was injured; and a deputy regimental commander 
was hurt through being pushed to the ground and crushed. A 
company of military police arrived at the scene and prevented 
the incident from worsening. That evening the regimental 
commander called an emergency regiment-wide meeting, declaring 
that this was organized opposition to Army discipline and 
political in nature, and that the leading five officers and 
soldiers, including two platoon commanders, would be put in 
isolation and interrogated, with the rest ordered to write 
self-criticisms. 
<H5>  Places of Origin Was the Precipitating Factor </H5>
  The anti-chemical-warfare company was garrisoned near 
Songji, 
Anhui, about 24 km from Huainan City. Company soldiers came 
from Sichuan or Hebei, while most of its cadres hailed from 
Hebei. The company comprised new recruits, recruited mainly in 
1991. In training, promotion, leave approval, and military 
training, company cadres were biased in favor of soldiers from 
Hebei; but beat up Sichuan soldiers under any excuse, had them 
give them gifts at festivals or on their birthdays, opened their 
letters from their families, and even stated that they wanted 
soldiers from Chengdu and Chongqing to buy them tributes. The 
soldiers had reported against them before. When the company 
command found out, it ordered a soldier whose family name was 
Liu to retire on the excuses of poor discipline and ideological 
problems. This spring, two Sichuan soldiers were 
court-martialed for assaulting the company instructor and 
claiming they would kill the little bully in the Army, and were 
discharged after serving six months in jail. 
<H5>  Some 50 Cadres Were Replaced </H5>
  Sources said a great reshuffle took place after the 
incident: 
The anti-chemical-warfare company was dissolved and reassembled, 
with a complete reorganization of the company command; the 
regimental commander and barracks trainers were removed with 
unofficial instructions that they retire; political, 
organizational, and Army discipline education was launched 
within the military base; and over 50 cadres at or above company 
rank were replaced.

  [Text] Hefei, January 4 (XINHUA) -- Government officials or 
employees who fund the education of their children and relatives 
from the public purse face stiff punishment in east China's 
Anhui Province. 
  Since a province-wide anti-corruption campaign was mounted 
last May Anhui has discovered that public funds have been 
misappropriated to the tune of 826 million yuan, of which 774 
million yuan has been recovered, according to the local 
authorities. 
  Over the years some government cadres in Anhui routinely 
embezzled public money and deposited it in their bank accounts. 
They also used public money to offer high-interest loans, build 
private houses, buy high-class furniture, gamble and visit 
prostitutes. 
  These corrupt practices have sparked widespread public 
resentment, which led to a government-orchestrated clampdown. 
  The number of officials involved in the spending of public 
funds on the education of their offspring and relatives totalled 
more than 300,000, including hundreds of government 
functionaries at bureau and county levels. 
  The campaign also uncovered some cases dating back to as 
early as the 1950s. This revealed flaws in the system of 
management of public funds, said a provincial official. 
  The investigations further revealed financial and accounting 
problems at the village level, which had resulted in the 
peasants' mistrust of the government. 
  A provincial official said that thousands of offenders have 
been detained and prosecuted. The resolute actions of the 
government have restored the confidence of the public and 
advanced the goal of building a clean government, he noted.

  [Text] In his Work Report to the Sixth Hubei Provincial 
CPC Congress, Comrade Guan Guangfu, [provincial party committee 
secretary], spelled out in no uncertain terms a series of 
strategic goals and principal tasks for Hubei in the nineties. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu stated: We will fulfill a great 
historical mission over the next five to seven years. Since 
Hubei should have a socialist market economic structure 
basically built and a comparatively well-off living standard 
realized by the turn of the century, the newly elected Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee should exert its utmost to 
comprehensively deepen reform, this being undoubtedly a tough 
struggle; take a decisive step forward toward building a new 
economic structure; successfully withstand such rigorous 
challenges as sharp domestic and international market 
competition; concentrate on raising economic efficiency; strive 
to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy provincial national 
economic growth; work hard to have the provincial gross national 
product quadrupled ahead of time by 1997; make unreserved 
efforts to lay a solid foundation for achieving a comparatively 
well-off living standard; further improve the province's 
comprehensive economic strength, quality, and efficiency; and 
further press ahead with the province's social development. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu pointed out in his Work Report: Hubei 
will continually face the following 11 basic tasks in terms of 
economic and social growth in the nineties: 
  1. To maintain average annual gross national product growth 
at or above 9.2 percent; 
  2. To push economic growth onto three new stages through 
three periods; 
  3. To fulfill the tasks laid down in the province's eighth 
five- year plan by 1994, one year ahead of schedule; 
  4. To have gross national product quadrupled by 1997, three 
years ahead of schedule; 
  5. To raise gross national product to more than 200 billion 
yuan on the basis of constant prices recorded in 1990; 
  6. To expeditiously increase total rural social output 
value, total industrial output value, and total tertiary 
industrial output value; 
  7. To raise the technical level of principal trades and 
professions to the nation's advanced technical level; 
  8. To considerably improve comprehensive scientific and 
technological strength; 
  9. To have nine-year compulsory education basically 
implemented, juvenile illiteracy basically eradicated, and the 
quality of labor comprehensively improved across the province; 
  10. To have afforestation stepped up and the ecological 
environment improved across the province; 
  11. To have the per capita net income of peasants raised to 
1,400 yuan, poverty eradicated in all poverty-stricken areas, 
and the annual increase in per capita net subsistence income 
among urban residents raised to or above 6 percent.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has handed out heavy sentences to the ring- 
leaders of an "anti-government" underground organisation in one 
of the most severe crackdowns since June 4, 1989. Yao Kaiwen 
and Gao Xiaoliang were found guilty of "organising and leading a 
counter- revolutionary group" by the Shanghai Intermediate Court 
on December 23. 
  Meanwhile the authorities have released Yang Zhou, a member 
of the Beijing-based peace charter movement after detaining him 
without charge for 45 days in a centre for tramps and migrant 
workers. 
  Sources in Shanghai said last night Yao, 53, a former 
teacher, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and deprivation of 
"political rights" for three years. Gao, 28, a former worker, 
got a nine-year jail term in addition to a two-year suspension 
of his rights. 
  The verdict said the two, who were detained last May, had in 
late 1992 organised a counter-revolutionary ring called the 
Mainland Headquarters of the Democratic China Front. A third 
organiser of the group, Yao Tiansheng, was released last 
September after a four- month detention. 
  The three-page verdict reportedly said that last September, 
Yao Kaiwen drafted a 10-point manifesto whose aim was "ending 
the dictatorial rule of the communist regime". The manifesto 
allegedly said the front was ready to take "peaceful and bloody, 
legal and illegal, domestic and foreign-aided actions" to 
further their goals of promoting democracy. 
  Prosecution authorities in Shanghai also accused Gao and the 
two Yaos of hatching an "anti-government" plot while meeting in 
a small local park last November. The trio reportedly discussed 
an action plan which included street demonstrations, forming 
brigades of workers, occupying radio and TV stations, and 
detaining municipal party and government leaders. 
  The verdict said: The three were the "core organisers" of 
the front and that "they had decided upon their division of 
labour". It also said the group had mapped out plans to publish 
an illegal journal called Free China. 
  Summing up the Government's case, court officials claimed 
that the accused had admitted their actions, which amounted to 
"attempts to topple the administration of the people's 
democratic dictatorship as well as the socialist order". They 
said the heavy sentences were called for because the two had 
committed their "crimes" less than three years after being 
released from re-education through labour camps. 
  Yao Kaiwen, who was an individual entrepreneur upon his 
detention, spent 18 months in a labour camp after having been 
found guilty in early 1990 of trying to smuggle himself out of 
China. And Gao, who used to work at a pharmaceutical factory, 
was given a two-year term in August 1989 for taking part in the 
pro-democracy movement. 
  Members of China's dissident community said last night they 
were shocked by the severity of the sentences. Friends of Gao 
and Yao said they belonged to the relatively radical fringe of 
the democracy movement. "There is no evidence to suggest the 
front has ever had more than four or five active members," a 
Shanghai source said. "That adherents of the front do not seem 
to have ruled out acts of violence in their theoretical 
discussions does not mean they will actually commit them." The 
source added that even if accusations made by the prosecution 
were true, the punishment was severe because the organisation 
had never put their ideas into action. 
  Meanwhile, on New Year's Eve, authorities in Shanghai freed 
Mr. Yang, one of nine dissidents who put down their names to a 
draft of the peace charter released in Beijing on November 14. 
The so-called peace charter movement espouses "national 
reconciliation" through a non-violent campaign for a multi-party 
system. 
  Mr. Yang, whose activism dates to the late 1970s, was 
detained by Beijing police hours after the release of the 
document. The dissident was held in a centre for tramps and 
transients in Beijing until December 5, when he was taken under 
guard to a similar facility in Shanghai. However, another 
signatory of the charter, Wuhan-based activist Qin Yongmin, who 
was arrested together with Mr. Yang, is believed to be detained 
in the central China city. 
  Mr. Yang, who said he lost a tooth and a few kilograms 
during 
his ordeal, said it was illegal for the authorities to hold him 
in a centre for illegal migrant workers. "I had no recourse to 
the judicial process and I was not allowed to contact my 
family," he said in his Shanghai apartment yesterday. Mr. Yang 
said he would continue his non-violent campaign for democracy, 
warning that Beijing's continued refusal to tolerate the 
peaceful expression of dissent could spawn acts of violence by 
more radical factions of the movement.

Shouchang (0491 1108 2490): "Stabilize the Prices of Grains, 
Cereal Oil, Vegetables, Meat, and Eggs and do a Good Job in 
Supply"] 
  [Text] On 17 December the municipal government held an 
emergency meeting of responsible persons of grain and pricing 
departments in the city outskirts to devise plans for 
successfully carrying out macroeconomic regulation and control; 
for stabilizing the prices of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, 
meat, and eggs; and for arranging market supply. Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the municipal party committee and Mayor Li Qiyan 
gave important speeches. 
  Recently, some citizens have noticed the rise in the prices 
of grains and cereal oil and some grain shops have failed to 
guarantee normal supply. The municipal party committee and 
government have paid great attention to this and have promptly 
adopted measures and devised plans. 
  In a speech, Li Qiyan pointed out: Pricing is a major issue, 
affecting the immediate interests of the masses and the smooth 
progress of reform, which we must give great attention. The 
grain and pricing departments and all districts must 
conscientiously implement the central guidelines and immediately 
adopt economic and necessary administrative means to stabilize 
the prices of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, meat, and eggs. 
It will be good for the overall situation and stability when 
prices are stable. The grain departments should have a sense of 
the overall situation, do their work well on their own 
initiative, and should not only consider the interests of their 
own departments and trades. At present, some state grain shops 
have taken the lead in raising grain prices. This is a very 
serious problem that must be checked. He stressed: To develop 
the socialist market economy, the government grain and cereal 
oil management departments and state enterprises should have 
something to do. They must conduct macroeconomic regulation and 
control and give play to their role as the main channels. Some 
comrades are confused about this, so they must seek unity in 
ideology and understanding. All departments and various 
districts and counties should make concerted efforts, adopt 
practical measures, effectively stabilize the commodity prices, 
keep abreast of the market information and grass-roots situation 
in a timely manner, and guarantee that the masses will have a 
happy new year and Spring Festival. 
  Executive Vice Mayor Wang Baosen also gave a speech in which 
he noted: At present, there is an ample supply of grains, 
cereal oil, and other commodities across the municipality and 
the market supply will be guaranteed. State-run grain and cereal 
oil departments should give play to their role as the main 
channels. Meanwhile, the municipal authorities will adopt 
resolute measures; implement strict measures to set the prices 
of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, meat, and eggs, which are 
essential for residents; and will sell some major variety of 
vegetables at a fixed price. The marketing unit must strictly 
implement these measures and the relevant departments must 
strengthen inspection and strictly investigate, handle, and 
expose those units that recklessly raise prices. 
  In his speech, Chen Xitong stressed: The socialist market 
economy must have a sound macroeconomic regulation and control 
system. We must seek unity in the understanding of this. 
Leaders at all levels and all departments must conscientiously 
study the decisions of the central authorities on some issues 
concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic 
system and never forget their own functions in macroeconomic 
regulation and control. These arbitrary price increases in some 
units are absolutely man-made. Now that the grain reserves are 
abundant, the production is fine, and the purchasing situation 
is good, what makes them increase prices? This is caused by 
their abnormal market prediction psychology. Some grain 
departments failed to promptly adopt measures to keep the prices 
stable and misunderstood the meaning of market economy. They 
believed that decontrolling the grain prices means not 
interfering with the prices regardless of the consequences and 
that market regulation and control means following the beaten 
track. All these understandings are wrong. The socialist 
market economy is not a nongovernment economy, but one with 
macroeconomic regulation and control. This practice is a good 
chance for study. We should learn how to successfully conduct 
macroeconomic regulation and control in the course of developing 
the socialist market economy. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: We should combine reform with 
stability; give simultaneous attention to reform, development, 
and stability; and guard against one-sidedness. Arbitrary price 
hikes will affect other sectors, the stable situation, and the 
good environment. Beijing is the capital. All departments, 
districts, and counties should have the sense of the capital, 
consider the overall situation, make concerted efforts, adopt 
effective measures, stabilize the prices of grains and cereal 
oil; and let the common people enjoy an ease of mind in buying 
and have a happy new year and Spring Festival. This is a good 
thing we can do for the masses. 
  Municipal leaders, including Zhang Baifa, Duan Bingren, Meng 
Xuenong, Duan Qiang, and Fan Yuanmou also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- This reporter learned 
from the General Administration of Customs that the State 
Council Tariff Policy Committee, having decided on 17 November 
1993 to readjust tariff rates for 2,898 items of imported 
commodities, had made another decision to take a step further 
from the preferential tariff rates provided for in the 
Regulations of the Customs of the People's Republic of China on 
Import and Export Tariffs to implement provisional import tariff 
rates for 234 categories of commodities -- including farm 
chemicals, farm chemical agents, and other important raw 
materials related to domestic industrial and agricultural 
production, as well as parts and components of major machinery 
and electrical products for which domestic production is not yet 
possible or fails to meet the demand -- from 1 January through 
31 December 1994. In the meantime, it will levy tariffs at 
provisional rates on nine categories of export commodities 
including lead and zinc. 
  The major commodities and rate variations involved in the 
implementation of the provisional tariff rates for imported 
commodities are as follows: 
  1. Metal raw materials: The tariff rate for tinplate and its 
base plates is to be reduced to 9 percent from the existing 
statutory tariff rate of 15 percent; galvanized steel plate, to 
9 percent from 15 percent; thickened steel plate, to 5 percent 
from 12 percent; odd-shape steel material, to 6 percent from 12 
percent; and, refined copper, to 3 percent from 5 percent; 
respectively. 
  2. Chemical raw materials and products: The tariff rate for 
furanophenol is to be reduced from 5 to 3 percent; methylester 
of DV chrysanthemum acid and other agents for special farm 
chemicals, from 6 to 3 percent; toluene, from 12 to 3 percent; 
octyl alcohol, from 17 to 10 percent; acetone, from 15 to 7 
percent; xylene, from 12 to 3 percent; polypropylene, from 12 to 
5 percent; polystyrene, from 25 to 15 percent; polyhydroxy 
polyether, from 25 to 10 percent; and, ABS resinate [shu zhi 
2885 7927] and others, from 25 to 15 percent; respectively. 
  3. Agricultural goods and materials: The tariff rate for 
farm chemicals is to be reduced from 6 to 4 percent; chemical 
fertilizer, from 5 to 4 percent; forage, from 9 to 5 percent; 
raw material for forage, from 5 to 3 percent; and, additives and 
others, from 9 to 5 percent; respectively. 
  4. Parts and components for machinery and electric products: 
including chip capacitors, to be lowered from 23 to 10 percent; 
chip resistors, from 20 to 12 percent; chip diodes, from 20 to 
10 percent; display tubes for monitors, from 25 to 12 percent; 
electronic fuel injectors for car engines, from 20 to 10 
percent; and CKD spare parts for hard discs (over 20 mega 
bytes), from 9 to 6 percent. 
  Lower provisional tariffs will also be put on: for news 
paper, from 20 to 7 percent; log, from 15 to 10 percent; and 
timber and timber sheets for making plywood, from 9 to 6 percent. 
  Lower provisional tariffs will be put on mainly the 
following 
export products: for lead ores and concentrates, from 30 to zero 
percent; zinc ores and concentrates, from 30 to zero percent; 
tin ores and concentrates, from 50 to 20 percent; phosphorus, 
from 20 to 10 percent; and benzine, from 40 to zero percent. 
  According to officials of the General Administration of 
Customs, as 1994 will be a crucial year for China's economic 
structural reform, lower provisional tariffs on major raw 
materials for agricultural and industrial productions and parts 
and components for key machinery and electric products will be 
conducive to stabilizing commodity prices, facilitating the 
smooth implementation of various reform measures, and promoting 
a sustained, rapid, and steady growth [chi xu kuai su wen ding

  [Text] The provincial party committee held the rural work 
conference in Jinan on 8 December. This is the first 
large-scale meeting since the sixth provincial party committee 
was elected. The main subjects discussed at the conference were 
to study and implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the central 
rural work conference, to sum up and exchange the experiences in 
rural reform and development, to discuss and work out the policy 
measures for speeding up the development of agriculture and the 
rural economy under the socialist market economic conditions, 
and to arrange the agricultural and rural work in 1994 and in 
the foreseeable future. 
  Present at the conference were leading comrades of the 
provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress, 
the provincial government, and the provincial committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including 
Jiang Chunyun, Zhao Zhihao, Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Lu Maozeng, 
Ma Zhongcai, Dong Fengji, Chen Jianguo, Sun Shuyi, Guo Changcai, 
Wang Jiangong, and Wang Yuxi; secretaries of the city and 
prefectural party committees; vice mayors (vice commissioners) 
in charge of agriculture and the rural economic work; chairmen 
of the city and prefectural agricultural commissions; directors 
of the town and township enterprise administrative bureaus; 
secretaries of the county (city and district) party committees; 
and responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments. 
Xiao Wanjun, vice chairman of the central policy research 
office, attended the conference. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the 
conference. Wang Jiangong, vice governor of the provincial 
government, relayed the guidelines of the central rural work 
conference. 
  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
made an important speech at the conference. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: According to the guidelines of 
the 
third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and 
the central rural work conference and in line with the actual 
conditions, the province should persist in the following basic 
ideologies of speeding up the development of agriculture and the 
rural economy in the foreseeable future: Unswervingly implement 
the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy and persistently put agriculture in the primary 
position of the economic work. The development of high-yield, 
good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture should be regarded 
as the fundamental way for agricultural development. The 
cultivation of the mainstay of the market, the improvement of 
the market system, the enhancement of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and the protection of agriculture should 
be regarded as the main contents of the rural reform. The 
acceleration of the rural economic development, the ceaseless 
increase of the peasants' income, and the realization of the 
target of becoming fairly well-off should be regarded as the 
fundamental starting and ending point of the rural work. We 
should strive to make a new leap in the rural economic 
development. In line with these basic ideologies and ideas and 
according to the provincial party committee standing committee's 
study opinions, Jiang Chunyun talked about seven issues as 
follows: 
  Jiang Chunyun first urged that under the conditions of the 
socialist market economy, we should further understand and 
upgrade agriculture's role as the foundation of the national 
economy. He said: The issues relating to agriculture, rural 
areas, and the peasants are always the fundamental issues 
relating to the overall situation of the party and the state. 
Reviewing the work done in the past years, we know that the 
party and government leaders at various levels have gradually 
upgraded their understanding about agriculture's role as the 
foundation of the national economy and upgraded their awareness 
of agriculture. The overall agricultural and rural economic 
situation is good. However, through the examinations according 
to the guidelines of the central instructions, we know that some 
leaders still lag behind in terms of their understanding about 
the role of agriculture and fail to firmly foster the idea of 
taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. 
Under the new situation, they consciously or unconsciously 
neglect agriculture. This is a problem that the party and 
government leaders at various levels across the province should 
pay high attention to. The provincial party committee 
maintained that under the new situation of developing the 
socialist market economy, the leading cadres at various levels, 
particularly those at or above the county level, should further 
study and understand Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin's 
important expositions, work closely in line with reality, 
further understand and upgrade agriculture's role as the 
foundation of the national economy, and strive to make a new 
leap in understanding. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed the necessity to clearly understand 
the following few points: First, although the proportion of 
agriculture in the national economy is relatively reduced, 
agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy has 
not been changed yet. The developed industry should be based on 
the developed agriculture. Only when the foundation of 
agriculture is solid will we be able to greatly develop the 
secondary and tertiary industries. Second, agriculture's role 
as the foundation of the national economy and agriculture's 
strategic functions cannot be replaced in the course of 
developing the socialist market economy and carrying out the 
open policy. Third, enabling peasants to by and large have 
sufficient food and clothes does not mean that agriculture has 
passed the test. We should affirm the breakthrough in 
Shandong's agriculture and rural economy and the historical 
changes in the rural outlook achieved in the past decade and 
more since reform and opening up started. However, tasks to 
develop agriculture and rural economy remain very arduous. We 
should never overestimate our agricultural production level and 
peasants' prosperity level, be unrealistically optimistic and 
complacent, or neglect and slacken efforts in the issues of 
agriculture, rural areas, and peasants. Fourth, judging from a 
long-term viewpoint, the fundamental position of agriculture 
should be further strengthened instead of weakened if we are to 
attain the "three- step" strategic objective of economic 
development. Merely a small number of counties among the 135 
counties, cities, and districts of the province have achieved a 
fairly comfortable standard of living, merely 21 percent of the 
rural population have achieved a per capita income of 1,000 yuan 
or more, and some peasants in mountainous areas and areas 
adjacent to reservoirs and beaches have yet to have sufficient 
food and clothes. Evidently, without a great development in 
agriculture and rural economy, the grand goal of modernization 
cannot be attained smoothly. Fifth, we should also note that 
agriculture is not only an economic issue but also a political 
and social issue concerning the future and destiny of the party 
and the state. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphasized: As a large agricultural province, 
Shandong must attach great importance to agriculture at all 
times and under all circumstances. It should never hold that 
agriculture is no longer the foundation of the national economy 
just because agriculture accounts for a small proportion; never 
hold that agriculture is no longer important just because we are 
developing the market economy and opening to the outside world; 
never hold that we may slacken efforts in agriculture just 
because there is a bumper harvest every year and peasants have 
sufficient food and clothes; and never hold that we may relax 
and all is well just because the rural situation is relatively 
stable. Following the requirements of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, we must have more initiative in 
developing agriculture and rural economy in the historical 
process of developing the socialist market economy. We should 
see to it that the better the situation is, the more we should 
attach importance to and strengthen agriculture and rural work; 
that the more reform is deepened and the wider we open to the 
outside world, the more we should pay attention to agriculture 
and make it successful; and that the more the market economy is 
developed, the more we should protect and support agriculture. 
  The second issue Jiang Chunyun discussed was revising and 
improving the plans for the development of agriculture and rural 
economy in line with the need for developing the socialist 
market economy. He said: In the condition of the market 
economy, we need a scientific plan for accelerating the 
development of agriculture and rural economy. Based on the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee and Shandong's "three-step" strategy for 
economic development, we should include the development of 
agriculture and rural economy in the overall plan for the 
socialist market economy and, in line with the principle of 
"adjusting the structure, improving efficiency, accelerating 
development, and increasing income," map out overall plans and 
rational arrangements and implement them step by step in line 
with specific local conditions. The general plan of the 
province is to greatly facilitate the industrialization, 
commercialization, and modernization of agriculture in line with 
the requirement for developing the socialist market economy and, 
by the end of this century, to develop Shandong's agriculture 
into commercial and market-oriented agriculture with the 
characteristics of coastal developed areas--rational layout, 
balanced structure, advanced technology, scientific management, 
high rate of resources utilization, large share of the market, 
high degree of opening up, and high overall efficiency--and to 
raise the overall quality of Shandong's agriculture and rural 
economy to a new level and turn Shandong from a large 
agricultural province into a strong agricultural province. 
After achieving this, we should make efforts for another decade 
to by and large attain agricultural modernization and establish 
a new pattern of industrialized, commercialized, and modernized 
agriculture. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphasized: To attain the above-mentioned 
targets, we should accelerate development of rural economy in 
all sectors and achieve new breakthroughs in some key spheres 
and key links: 1) a new breakthrough in structural adjustment, 
2) a new breakthrough in improving the comprehensive production 
capacity of agriculture, 3) a new breakthrough in increasing 
scientific and technological content in farm products, 4) a new 
breakthrough in the processing of farm and sideline products, 5) 
a new breakthrough in the transfer of rural labor forces and the 
construction of small cities and towns, and 6) a new 
breakthrough in developing export- oriented agriculture. Based 
on the guidelines of the central rural work conference and this 
conference and their specific local conditions, all localities 
in the province should conscientiously revise and improve their 
own plans, put forward realistic and feasible targets and key 
points of development and supporting measures, and implement 
them in a down-to-earth manner. 
  The third issue Jiang Chunyun discussed was to accelerate 
rural reform, with the aim of establishing the socialist market 
economy system. 
  He said: Cultivating the mainstay of the market and 
improving the rural operating system are important tasks of the 
current rural reform. By deepening the reform, we should truly 
turn peasant households and rural operating organizations into 
producers and dealers of commodities who are independent in 
management, responsible for their own profits and losses, and 
capable of self- development and self-restraint and into the 
mainstay of the market which is full of vigor and vitality. We 
should fully respect peasant households' decision-making power 
in management and, in line with the stipulations of the central 
authorities, extend the term of land contracts another 30 years. 
We should gradually establish and improve the system of paid 
transfer of land use right according to law in line with the 
principle of peasants' voluntary participation and mutual 
benefit and gradually guide peasants to develop the 
optimal-scale management and intensive management of land in the 
localities where the secondary and tertiary industries are 
developed and most labor forces are engaged in the trade other 
than agriculture and have stable income. We should strengthen 
and improve unified management and expand the economic strength 
of the collectives step by step to enhance their service 
function. We should popularize the shareholding cooperation 
system in rural areas in an active and yet prudent manner. All 
localities should learn from and disseminate the experiences of 
Zhoucun and Laiyang and lead and encourage peasants to develop 
multiform shareholding cooperation in township enterprises, 
farming, livestock breeding, agricultural development, farmland 
capital construction, and tertiary industry. Meanwhile, we 
should conscientiously summarize experiences and formulate 
corresponding rules and laws to gradually standardize rural 
shareholding cooperation. 
  He said: How to lead peasants to the market and link the 
independent operation of thousands upon thousands of households 
to the unified large market is another important issue we should 
resolve with great efforts when deepening the rural reform. The 
first thing is to establish and improve the rural market system. 
Shandong's markets for farm products have been developed better. 
However, the development of labor, money, technology, and 
information markets has been relatively sluggish, and 
development of the markets for property rights has yet to begin. 
The next step is to build more rapidly the markets for the 
wholesale of farm products and for the essential elements of 
production and, with the establishment of the modern enterprise 
system, actively explore ways to cultivate and build the markets 
for property rights to promote the rational distribution of the 
essential elements of production and the maintenance and 
increase of the value of collective assets. Rural cooperative 
foundations and shareholding cooperative foundations are the 
organizations for mutual aid with the collective funds of the 
communities. We should actively give them guidance, strengthen 
their management, standardize their activities, and give full 
play to their positive role in developing the rural market 
economy. Third, we should organize agricultural production in 
such a way that it is industrialized and actively apply the 
management form under which trade, industry, and agriculture are 
integrated, and production, processing, and marketing are a 
coordinated process. All localities in the province should 
industrialize agriculture and regard this as an important 
measure for facilitating rural reform and economic development. 
In line with the local resources and basic conditions and 
according to the domestic and foreign market demands, we should 
define our own key industries and products; carry out regional 
distribution, specialized production, coordinate management, 
socialized service, and enterprise management; and set up a 
production and management system of making cropping, breeding, 
and processing a coordinate process; production, supply, and 
marketing a coordinate process; agriculture, industry, and 
commerce a coordinate process; and agriculture, science, and 
education a coordinate process. We should pay attention to 
industrializing agriculture on a trial basis. We should foster 
the idea of circulation on a large scale; break the bounds of 
different trades, different regions, and different ownerships; 
develop large- scale circulation and large markets; positively 
guide and organize tens of millions of the peasants to enter the 
circulation spheres; and fundamentally solve the purchasing and 
marketing difficulties. 
  He pointed out: Strengthening and improving the 
macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and 
effectively protecting and supporting agriculture is also a 
problem that should urgently be solved in the course of 
deepening reform. According to the state requirements for the 
macro regulation and control over agriculture, we should perfect 
the means for regulation and control, set up a special grain 
storage system and grain risk-taking funds, and establish 
branches of agricultural policy banks and commercial banks. We 
should set up a system to support and protect agriculture, fix 
grain protective prices and the ceiling prices for means of 
production, and perfect the various-layered grain storage 
systems. The reduced portions of the grain subsidies of the 
financial departments at various levels should be used as grain 
risk-taking funds but must not be diverted for other purposes. 
We should also study ways to set up systems to protect and 
store up such major farm products as cotton and oil-bearing 
crops. 
  We should conscientiously sum up experiences gained from 
practice and positively explore the best ways for developing 
agriculture and the rural economy. This is the fourth issue 
that Jiang Chunyun defined in his speech: He pointed out: Over 
the past years, all localities in the province have positively 
made explorations in this aspect, created many successful 
experiences, and pioneered the ways of development with special 
features. The ways of development can be summarized as follows: 
First, ways for high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture. Second, ways for comprehensively developing a 
diversified economy. Third, ways for making trade, industry, 
and agriculture a coordinate process and production, supply, and 
marketing a coordinate process. Fourth, ways for developing the 
export-oriented agriculture. Fifth, ways for overall 
development. Sixth, ways for cultivating markets to promote 
development. Seventh, ways for linking agriculture with science 
and education and coordinating science with prices and policies. 
Besides, there are ways with which each township should have its 
own specialized trade and each village should have its own 
special product, ways for developing transcropping and 
transplanting agriculture and ecological agriculture, and ways 
for developing garden-based economy. The aforementioned ways 
are created by the masses in the course of reform and 
development. All localities should proceed from their actual 
conditions to study these ways and use them for reference, 
select accurate ways suitable to their local conditions, 
continue to make improvement in the course of practice, and 
strive to make a new leap in agriculture and the rural economy. 
  When talking about the fifth issue, Jiang Chunyun stressed 
that we should firmly foster the ideology that science and 
technology are the primary productive forces and positively 
carry out the strategy of relying on science and education to 
rejuvenate Shandong. He pointed out: The key to developing 
high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, 
elevating the rural economy to a new height, and modernizing 
agriculture is to actually popularize and apply agricultural 
science and technology. The party and government leaders at 
various levels across the province should strategically change 
their guiding ideologies and realistically shift the focus of 
agricultural development onto the orbit of relying on scientific 
and technological progress and upgrading the quality of 
laborers. We should ensure that top leaders should personally 
grasp the primary productive forces and grasp the following 
several key work links. First, we should accelerate the 
popularization of existing applied agrotechnologies and turn 
scientific and technological findings into productive forces. 
Second, we should strengthen the basic and applied research on 
agricultural science and technology. Third, we should 
popularize and apply new high technology and cultivate and 
develop new agricultural growing points. We should continue to 
run nine provincial-level new high-tech development experimental 
zones and some city and prefectural experimental centers, bring 
into full play these experimental zones' exemplary roles, and 
promote the development and application of agricultural new 
high-tech. Fourth, we should restore and improve the 
agricultural science and technology dissemination network as 
soon as possible. Agrotechnology dissemination organizations at 
all levels are the bridges for developing agriculture through 
the application of science and technology. We should restore 
and improve such organizations as soon as possible according to 
the agriculture law and the law on science and technology 
dissemination. We should develop more rapidly and improve the 
county-level agrotechnology dissemination organizations and step 
up efforts to determine the nature, establishment, and personnel 
quotas of town and township agrotechnology dissemination 
organizations. We should actively support peasants' specialized 
technology associations and research societies and 
nongovernmental science and technology organizations and give 
full play to their role in disseminating agricultural science 
and technology and leading peasants to prosperity through 
application of science and technology. Fifth, we should exert 
great efforts to train scientific and technical personnel. 
  Speaking on the sixth issue, Jiang Chunyun urged further 
efforts to intensify construction of infrastructural facilities 
to raise the level of agricultural modernization. He said: To 
push agriculture up to a new level, infrastructural facilities 
for agriculture should reach a new level first. The focus of 
the infrastructural facilities for agriculture is farmland water 
conservancy projects. For many years in a row, Shandong has 
organized millions of laborers to build farmland capital 
construction on a large scale, with the focus on harnessing 
rivers, thus greatly improving the conditions for agricultural 
production. Generally speaking, however, the province has yet 
to fundamentally change the situation of "feeding the people at 
the mercy of heaven." Following the requirements of the central 
authorities, we should regard water conservancy projects and 
other infrastructural facilities for agriculture as important as 
energy, communication, and other basic industries and attach 
sufficient importance to them. We should adhere to the 
principle of emphasizing both the antidrought work and flood 
prevention, both the work to increase income and the work to 
reduce expenses, and both construction and management and 
persistently draw up unified plans for comprehensive improvement 
of mountains, rivers, farmland, forests, and roads. A success 
in farmland water conservancy projects depends mainly on the 
labor accumulation of peasants. Meanwhile, we should increase 
investment from various sources. 
  He said: The development of the market-oriented agriculture 
urgently requires good infrastructural facilities for 
circulation. All localities in the province should regard 
construction of such facilities as the basic work for developing 
the rural market economy and, like Zhucheng, Shouguang, and 
Cangshan, build supporting facilities for the processing, 
storage, and transportation of farm and sideline products to 
provide a basic guarantee for peasants to enter the market. In 
the process to promote agricultural modernization, they should 
regard it as an important task to achieve mechanization and 
should strive to gradually mechanize the major links of 
production, such as plowing, harvesting, transportation, 
threshing, and drying, and the work after production, such as 
the processing and storage of farm products, so that their 
equipment for agricultural modernization will be raised to a new 
level. We should adopt effective measures to speed up 
development of chemical fertilizer, pesticide, plastic sheet for 
farm use, and other agriculture-oriented industries. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun spoke on strengthening and 
improving party leadership over rural work to comply with the 
new situation in developing the socialist market economy. He 
pointed out: Developing the rural market economy and building 
socialist new countryside with Chinese characteristics 
constitute a brand-new undertaking, and comprehensive 
strengthening and improvement of party leadership over rural 
work is needed. City, prefectural, and county party committees 
should focus their work and energy on rural work. Major 
responsible comrades of the party committees and governments at 
all levels should personally attend to agriculture and rural 
work. Comrades in charge of agriculture and rural work of party 
committees and governments should truly hold their 
responsibilities. Other members of city, prefectural, and 
county leading bodies should also show concern for and study the 
issues on rural areas and make their work serve agricultural 
development still better. As they are on the forefront of rural 
work, town and township party committees should always regard 
agriculture as the work of prime importance and successfully 
organize forces to develop it. Leading cadres at all levels 
should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to improve their 
ideological, theoretical, leadership, and policy-making levels. 
We should particularly study well Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, master and apply 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's basic stand, viewpoints, and methods to 
conscientiously analyze and study the new conditions, new 
issues, and new experiences in the current rural reform and 
development, respect practice, laws, dialectics, and the masses' 
creation, strive to turn perceptual knowledge into rational 
knowledge, and implement correct and effective policies and 
leadership over agriculture, rural economy, and social 
development. Meanwhile, we should also conscientiously study the 
knowledge on the market economy, science and technology, and 
management to continuously upgrade our ability to lead and 
control the rural market economy. 
  He emphasized: We should persistently attend to two tasks 
simultaneously and be competent in both. The current main 
stream in the rural ideological and political field is good, but 
problems in ideology, social conduct, and public security remain 
rather conspicuous, which our party and government departments 
at all levels should pay great attention to. The more we 
accelerate reform, opening up, and economic construction, the 
more we should strengthen the socialist spiritual civilization, 
democracy, and the legal system so that we can truly attend to 
both and be competent in both. We should educate rural cadres 
to develop democratic work styles, enhance sense of respect for 
the legal system, and successfully carry out ideological and 
political work to resolve contradictions. We should strictly 
crack down on various economic and criminal offenses according 
to law to eliminate the various ugly phenomena, safeguard rural 
public security, and make sure that peasants have a sense of 
security toward production and their life. 
  He pointed out: In improving leading bodies, we should pay 
attention to two aspects. One is the leading bodies of county 
and township party committees, and the other is the rural 
grass-roots party branches. In particular, we should do a good 
job in selecting secretaries of party branches. We should make 
conscientious efforts to improve leadership styles and 
leadership methods. Leading cadres at all levels should meet the 
demands put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin for devoting more 
time to study and attending fewer parties, conducting more 
investigations and study and engage less in subjectivism, and 
doing more solid work and giving less empty talk. They should 
often visit rural areas, rural households, and the forefront of 
agricultural production to conduct investigations and study, 
give heed to the voice of the masses, ensure implementation of 
policies, and earnestly carry out solid work for peasants. We 
should advocate earnest efforts to tell truth, seek real 
results, and do practical work and oppose formalism, 
exaggeration, and cheating. We should all the more prohibit 
coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline, and 
those who violate laws and discipline should be strictly 
investigated and dealt with. In giving work guidance, we should 
not only pay attention to the development of economically 
developed localities but also attach importance to the 
development of and support to the economically less developed 
localities. We should continue to reduce the burdens on 
peasants and formulate laws to manage this work. Leaders at all 
levels should use policies and fruitful work to fully boost 
peasants' enthusiasm for reform and development and guide, 
protect, and develop well their enthusiasm. All trades and 
professions should support and protect agriculture. They should 
firmly embrace the idea that "they can achieve development only 
when agriculture is development and they share the same fate 
with peasants," be eager to meet the needs of peasants, and 
provide them with what they need.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 4 (XINHUA) -- The Hongqiao 
International Airport in this China's largest economic center 
has operated safely for five years running. 
  A survey shows that the airport accommodated 63,000 planes 
and transported 7.6 million passengers last year without 
airport-related incidents. 
  An official of the airport attributed the good results to 
imposing ten measures to ensure safety and on-the-job 
responsibility. 
  While reinforcing safety checks and inviting specialists to 
give lectures, airport authorities have increased the number of 
tours of inspection at the airport. 
  Last year the airport handled 1,310 passengers with 
incomplete boarding papers and false identity cards as well as 
193 persons without tickets. Numerous contraband goods were 
also confiscated.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Wen: "Guangdong To See More Foreign </F>
Bank Branches"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou -- South China's Guangdong Province is to 
accelerate its financial reform this year with a series of 
moves, including the approval of more foreign bank branches. 
  Zhu Wanli, president of the People's Bank of China Guangdong 
Branch said as the vanguard of the country's economic reform, 
the province is eager to see more foreign banks set up branches 
or offices next year. 
  He disclosed that Guangdong is planning to open 10 more 
foreign bank branches this year, increasing the number in the 
province to 49. 
  "Guangdong's booming economy preferential policies and its 
proximity to Hong Kong and Macao are luring a great number of 
foreign banks to test the business opportunities here," he said. 
  The province welcomes enquiries from all kinds of foreign 
banks, he added. 
  "But we are pretty careful in selecting banks," he said. 
  So far, 77 foreign banks have set up branches or offices in 
the province, 39 of which have business functions. 
  Shenzhen has 24 foreign bank branches,--the most in the 
province--while Guangzhou has seven. The other two are in 
Shantou and Zhuhai special economic zones. 
  Hong Kong East Asia Bank has reaped about HK$500,000 
($64,000) in profits after one year of operations in Guangzhou. 
  "Guangdong hopes the central government will allow other 
cities to open foreign bank branches next year," Zhu said. 
  On financial market reform, Zhu said the province will 
continue to develop fledgling markets, including those involving 
securities, foreign exchange and futures. 
  The establishment of a gold market on a trial basis is in 
the 
making and we hope to open the market this year, he said. 
  Foreign insurance companies are being encouraged to set up 
co- operative shareholding insurance companies, he said. 
  According to officials from the Guangzhou government, the 
capital city will set up stock branches at the Shenzhen and 
Shanghai securities exchanges this year. 
  Zhu said despite the central government's credit-tightening 
policy introduced last June, Guangdong financial organizations 
provided 6 billion yuan ($1 billion) more in loans in the 
January- to November period last year compared with the same 
period in 1992. 
  The amount of money put into circulation in 1993 almost 
doubled over 1992. 
  "We cut loans on badly-performing enterprises, but for ones 
that performed well, credit and loans kept coming, Zhu explained. 
  He attributed the growth in money circulation last year to 
the improvement in the province's production output, which rose 
20 percent over 1992. 
  As for banking reform, Zhu said his Guangdong branch will 
help strengthen the role of the People's Bank of China as the 
country's central bank. 
  Following the lead of the draft Banking Law, the province 
will turn its four specialized banks into commercial banks.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] On Sunday, 2 January, Hong Kong Bureau 
monitored the "Today's Hotline" program, a listener call-in show 
carried daily on Guangzhou Guangdong People's Radio Network in 
Mandarin from 1035-1200 GMT. Reception ranged from fair to 
poor. The following is a summary of the program. 
  1. The program opens with a brief introduction by the 
program host, Wen Tao. He invites listeners to call in to 
recommend topics for discussion. As a New Year token, the host 
says he will dedicate a song to the first caller of the day. 
  2. While waiting for the first call, a song in Mandarin, 
"Goodbye My Love," sung by Hong Kong-Taiwan singer Teresa Teng, 
is played. 
  3. A Miss Pan, a hairdresser from another province who works 
with a hairdresser parlor in Guangzhou, calls in to complain 
about the practice by local parlor owners to retain workers by 
delaying payment of salaries. She says one of her friends, also 
a hairdresser, has not received her salary for the last six 
months, and when she asked her employer to pay off the salary in 
arrears as she was going to pay a home visit during the coming 
Chinese New Year season, her employer refused to pay but tried 
to persuade her to stay with the parlor during the current high 
season. Miss Pan says she herself is also facing a similar case 
at the moment. 
  4. A Mr. Zhang, a migrant laborer working in Guangzhou and 
planning to pay a home visit during the Spring Festival season, 
calls in to urge the traffic control authorities to pay more 
attention to keeping good traffic order during the present 
passenger high season. He complains that many drivers who are 
eager to make more money always try to take as many passengers 
as possible and drive as fast as possible, without paying the 
least attention to traffic regulations. 
  5. A Hong Kong-style Cantonese pop song is broadcast during 
a break. 
  6. A young man called Little Ma calls in to complain that 
construction work going on in Huadu city near Guangzhou is 
causing very serious air pollution. He calls for more attention 
to the air pollution problem and urges construction companies 
concerned to carry out their duty to minimize pollution. 
  7. A Miss Liu says she often comes across motorcades on 
highways around Baiyun Airport and, whenever such motorcades 
pass by, the police never fail to drive other road users out of 
their way. She says most motorcades are convoys for 
high-ranking government officials who claim to be servants of 
the people. She compares these motorcades to emperors' and 
senior mandarins' convoys in imperial China of the past. As 
civil servants, officials should try to minimize the 
inconvenience caused to the public while they are travelling, 
she says. 
  8. A French song is broadcast before the brief newscast. 
  9. Newscast at 1100 GMT. 
  10. Commercial break. 
  11. The "Today's Hotline" program resumes at 1109 GMT. A 
Mr. Jiao calls in to complain that the bus fare varies 
tremendously, from 8 to 15 yuan, for a trip between Guangzhou 
and Heshan. He wonders why the public bus company does not set 
a uniform bus fare for the route. 
  12. A Miss Sun, who recently experienced a road accident, 
calls on the police to intervene promptly in settling disputes 
arising from traffic accidents. 
  13. Commercial break. 
  14. A Mr. Zhang calls in to review the results of the 
Dongfeng Road traffic control program that has been implemented 
for three months. 
  15. The program host dedicates a song sung by Hong Kong 
songstar Jacky Cheung to this Mr. Zhang, who is said to be a 
long supporter of the program. 
  16. A Mr. Duan, who is also an old friend of the program, 
complains about the poor management of the town gas supply to 
the civil servant residential quarters at Guangzhou Avenue. He 
criticizes the town gas corporation for poor service. The host 
asks him to write the radio station a letter giving details of 
his complaint so that the station can refer the case to the 
authorities concerned for a settlement. 
  17. Brief newscast at 1130 GMT. 
  18. Commercial break. 
  19. The program resumes at 1140 GMT. A Mr. Chen calls in to 
inquire about the law and regulations defining the ownership of 
rural land. He wonders whether the government of his home 
village, Douwen village in Puning county, is authorized to 
dispose of plots of land at its discretion, and he charges the 
village government with abusing power. 
  20. A Miss Zhang complains that the Shuqian Road branch of 
the Industrial and Commercial Bank often refuses to render a 
money exchange service, which she said is a legitimate function 
of the bank. 
  21. A love song sung in Mandarin. 
  22. A Miss Chen who is a philatelist complains about the 
Guangzhou Philately Company. She says she has a philately 
stored value card which entitles her to the privilege of buying 
newly released stamps. However, when she and many other 
philatelists went to Guangzhou Philately Company to buy the Art 
of Zheng Banqiao memorial stamp series that was released in 
October, the company refused to sell the stamps to them. 
Meanwhile, she found out that these stamps are available at 
philately stalls in town, for quadruple the original price. 
Miss Chen asks the philately company to respond to her 
complaint. 
  23. A Miss Lu who works for a Taiwan company's Guangzhou 
office says she went to the Liuhua district post office on 12 
November to remit a sum of 5,000 yuan to Hubei. The remittee 
had not received the money by 26 November, so she asked the post 
office to refund her money. She had still not received a refund 
two weeks later, so she visited the post office again on 13 
December. Again she found her case was not properly attended 
to. She is getting impatient and she asks for a prompt reply 
from the post office. 
  24. Lobo's "How Can I Tell Her I Love You" is heard before 
the end of the program.

  [Text] Haikou, January 4 (CNS) -- Hainan Province is set 
to go further in accelerating its reform, expand its opening to 
the outside world, strengthen and improve its macro-economic 
regulation, adjust its economic pattern, upgrade its economic 
results and keep the province's economy proceeding at a rapid 
and healthy pace in 1994, the Secretary of the Hainan provincial 
Party Committee and governor, Mr. Ruan Chongwu, said. 
  Mr. Ruan, reviewing last year's economic progress, said that 
the island province had produced a gross national product (GNP) 
of RMB [renminbi] 19.14 billion, 18.9 percent up over the 
previous year while the total industrial output value was RMB 
9.3 billion or a 28.9 percent rise. The agricultural output 
value was RMB 8.45 billion or a 6.2 percent gain. Fixed assets 
investment was RMB 13.5 billion or a 55 percent increase and the 
actual use of foreign investment was U.S.$730 million or a 62 
percent growth. 
  The balance of bank savings deposits at branches of national 
banks operating in the island was put at RMB 33.5 billion by 
late last year, 22 percent up over earlier in the year. All 
these figures indicate healthy economic development in the 
province. 
  The island, Mr. Ruan said, would grab the opportunity this 
year to quicken its economic exploitation. The planned GNP 
aimed for in Hainan this year is put at RMB 25 billion, 18 
percent up from last year. The island will concentrate its work 
in several sectors to achieve this end. 
  First, the rural economy will be strenuously exploited in a 
bid to increase the peasants' income and protect their 
interests. The planned agricultural output value set for this 
year is RMB 9.3 billion or a rise of ten percent over last year 
and township enterprises RMB 7.5 billion or a gain of 60 percent. 
  Second, technological renovation of industrial enterprises 
will be speeded up, including the automobile industry, 
construction materials, natural beverages, pharmaceuticals, 
clothing and electronics. The building up of industrial bases 
will be accelerated to bring in domestic and foreign advanced 
technology. The expected industrial output value set for this 
year is RMB 12.1 billion, 30 percent up over last year. 
  Third, domestic and foreign markets will be earnestly 
developed while tertiary industry will be exploited at an 
extraordinarily fast pace with tourism as its driving force in 
order for the island to get into the international market. 
  Fourth, the investment pattern will improve with an emphasis 
on the building up of 24 key projects with a planned investment 
of RMB 7 billion this year. A number of projects including an 
airport, power plant and expressway will see their construction 
speeded up while work on the start of the Yangpu Economic 
Development Zone and the Haikou Bonded Area must be quickened to 
bring in foreign investment. 
  Fifth, social order will be strengthened while various 
social 
undertakings will be carried out, a move creating a sound 
environment for domestic and foreign investors. 
  Mr. Ruan stressed the importance of legislation in the 
market 
economy and the pushing forward of reform. A legal system must 
be established as soon as possible to keep pace with the market 
economy, putting basic economic relations, market behaviour and 
market transactions in order.

  [Text] Yesterday, the provincial price control bureau 
contacted the governments, administrative offices, price control 
bureaus, and grain authorities of all cities and prefectures, 
announcing the ceiling prices for grain and oil sales. 
  The provincial price control bureau indicated that recently 
the prices of grain, oil, and nonstaple foodstuffs in some 
cities in our province have increased too much, which is an 
abnormal phenomenon. It has caused fluctuations of commodity 
prices on the market and increased living expenses of urban 
residents. The provincial party committee and government were 
very concerned about this issue and, in good time, held a 
special meeting to discuss it and make arrangements. 
  In order to ensure basic stability of the prices of daily 
necessities of the public during the solar and lunar New Year 
season, per approval of the provincial government, it is hereby 
decided that ceiling market prices are set for a number of main 
varieties of grain and oil. The provincial government-set 
prices per 500 grams are as follows: 0.67 yuan for standard 
wheat flour; 0.68 yuan for first-class whitened wheat flour; 
0.75 yuan for refined wheat flour; 4.00 yuan for peanut oil; and 
3.50 yuan for rapeseed oil. The prices of grain and oil in all 
cities and prefectures shall be set in light of local conditions 
by the city or prefectural governments or price control 
authorities without exceeding the provincial government-set 
upper limits. The prices of grain and oil products and other 
varieties shall also [words indistinct]. The ceiling prices 
become effective as of 23 January, which all state-run operating 
units and individuals must strictly abide by. 
  The provincial price control bureau demanded that price 
control authorities at all levels organize manpower to conduct 
full-scale inspection of local grain and oil markets. They 
should handle each and every case in which a unit or individual 
is found violating the regulations of the provincial price 
control bureau, and sternly penalize law-violating practices of 
taking advantage of the situation, jacking up prices recklessly, 
and disrupting market order, and expose them through the media.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Donggang (7115 2639 1511): "Grasp </F>
Ideological Line and Answer Practical Questions"] 
  [Text] On 8 December, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional 
party committee, delivered an important speech at the semester- 
opening ceremony of the first regional theoretical study class 
for principal leading cadres of various leagues and cities as 
well as various departments and bureaus. 
  He said: The publication and distribution of Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is a major event in 
the political life of all party members and all nationalities of 
people in the country. This book touches upon all the fields of 
politics, economy, science, culture, education, military 
affairs, and foreign affairs, and outlines the basic viewpoints 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. A red thread running through this book 
is the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking 
truth from facts. This is precisely the quintessence and soul 
of our theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. At present, grasping ideological line and 
answering practical questions is a key issue that should be 
truly grasped by cadres and the masses of all nationalities in 
the region in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping. 
  Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping has expounded an important viewpoint 
in the first place, that is, China must take its own way in 
developing itself and must build a socialism with its own 
characteristics. This simple and clear exposition has grasped 
the essence of the development road of Chinese socialism. This 
book has an extremely far-reaching significance in theory and 
practice, has straighten out the tendency of deviating from 
reality in the road of building and developing socialism, has 
answered the doubts, misgivings, and censures from both of the 
"left" and right fields, and has opened up the sole correct road 
for our socialist modernization drive. 
  Comrade Wang Qun said: When stressing on "taking our own 
road," we should on no account reject opening up. On the 
contrary, we should all the more strengthen opening up and use 
as reference and absorb all excellent scientific and cultural 
achievements in the world. Without opening up, we cannot 
achieve success in "taking our own road" and in building the 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. When stressing on 
"taking our own road," the only correct method is to "boldly try 
everything and go ahead" to open up the new road of our own in 
the places without roads. 
  He stressed: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the necessity of 
"upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100 
years." It is the most important "political assignment" given 
by Comrade Xiaoping to all comrades of the party and will be the 
most important issue of practice our party and country will face 
in the next scores of years. Only by constantly and 
unswervingly upholding this basic line can we firmly grasp the 
correct course and can we cope with a myriad changes by 
remaining unchanged. 
  Upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100 
years is not only a correct conclusion discovered by our party 
from the bitter historical experience but also the summary of 
the experiences gained by our country from the tremendous 
achievements in reform and opening up over the past 15 years. 
It is internally related with our strategic goal of marching 
forward in three steps and is an important guarantee for the 
success in all items of our work. 
  Comrade Wang Qun pointed out in line with the reality of 
the region: In the system of the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, the issue of development is a 
major proposition being on the central position. The key issue 
of the party's basic line is precisely the issue of economic 
development and the key issue of the nationalities work is also 
the issue of development. Therefore, a major issue facing the 
people of all nationalities in the region is to seize the 
opportunity and accelerate development. It is not only an 
economic issue but also a political issue. Over the past 40 
years or so since the founding of Inner Mongolia, particularly 
since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central 
Committee, the economy and society have developed very rapidly, 
achievements have been tremendous, a new situation characterized 
with developed economy, flourishing culture and harmonious 
relationship among different nationalities has emerged, and, 
what is more gratifying, a road of developing the economy and 
society has been found gradually. It should be noted, however, 
that we still lag behind some developed coastal areas, and we 
cannot expect to catch up with developed areas in a short period 
of time. However, we have the aspirations of exploiting our own 
advantages through reform and opening up and through the arduous 
struggle of all people, and have the aspirations of making full 
use of the advantages and favorable conditions in the fields of 
natural resources, geology, and policies to accelerate the 
growth rate and improve the efficiency in order to realize the 
magnificent goal of "joining the forefront" that was set forth 
by Comrade Xiaoping. 
  Comrade Wang Qun pointed out at conclusion: Whether a leader 
can always uphold the party's basic line is the practical 
criterion to judge his leading ability and political awareness, 
not only his ideological ability, problem-solving ability but 
also his party style, work style, and political character. To 
raise the theoretical level of the vast numbers of cadres 
through the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, all leaders are required to embrace the 
scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and the spirit 
of dealing with concrete matters relating to work, to learn to 
dialectically analyze and solve problems, to overcome 
lopsidedness and absolutism, to create a kind of enterprising 
spirit and risk-taking sense, and to actually give consideration 
to the interests of the people in order to constantly push the 
region's socialist modernization drive to a new stage. 
  Comrade Qian Fenyong presided over the semester-opening 
ceremony. Wang Zhan, Geriletu, and Wuyunqimuge attended the 
ceremony. 
  Also attending the ceremony were leading cadres of various 
major leading bodies, responsible persons of various democratic 
parties, and responsible comrades of various departments and 
units directly under the provincial authorities.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Wenlong, who 
hijacked a plane from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan on June 4 
last year, was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment by a local 
Taiwan court Tuesday [4 January]. 
  According to Taiwan newspapers, the Taiwan procurators in 
Taoyuan also instituted proceedings yesterday against Zhang Hai, 
Han Shuxue and Li Xiangyu, who also hijacked mainland planes to 
Taiwan last year, and demanded imprisonment of over 12 years for 
them. 
  Previously, some Taiwan media and public figures had urged 
that the hijackers should all be sent back to the mainland, 
where they should be sentenced to death or life-long prison 
terms without probation, according to China's laws.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jan (XINHUA) -- To commemorate the 15th 
anniversary of the publication of the "Message to Compatriots in 
Taiwan" by the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC], Vice Chairman Cheng Siyuan recently made a 
statement through the Voice of the Strait Radio Station which 
said: The "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" has brought about 
a relaxed situation in cross-strait relations. In the new year, 
the two sides of the strait should further strengthen contacts 
and exchanges to push forward the process of the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland. 
  Reviewing the changes that have taken place in cross-strait 
relations in the past 15 years since the publication of the 
message, Cheng Siyuan said: Because of the development of 
cross-strait relations, as of today, more than 1 million visits 
by people of both sides have been recorded; indirect trade has 
topped $10 billion; exchanges in various fields are increasing; 
and there has been a tremendous change in the painful situation 
of 15 years ago in which communications and contacts were 
totally cut off due to military confrontation between the two 
sides of the strait. He expressed the hope that both sides 
would treasure the new hard-won situation and push forward the 
relations between the two sides of the strait on the existing 
basis. 
  He said: Although exchanges and personnel contacts between 
the two sides have increased, they are also faced with many 
difficulties. On the one hand, the exchanges and contacts are 
still indirect, because the personnel visiting each side have to 
go by way of Hong Kong or a third country. Even the development 
of economic and trade relations has to be conducted through a 
third region. This not only wastes time and causes delays in 
business, but it also wastes money and manpower. On the other 
hand, the Taiwan authorities have set up many restrictions to 
obstruct exchanges and personnel contacts. He expressed the 
hope that the Taiwan authorities will take into account the 
vital interests of the people on both sides of the strait, adopt 
effective measures to remove the manmade obstacles, and 
establish, as soon as possible, postal links, trade relations, 
and air and shipping services between Taiwan and the mainland. 
  Cheng Siyuan said: Besides speeding up exchanges and 
contacts, an important task is to firmly stop the movement 
toward "independence for Taiwan" and to oppose all acts aimed at 
dividing the sovereignty of the state in the forms of "one 
China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." The failure to carry out 
this task well will cast a shadow over cross-strait relations 
and will affect the further development of relations between the 
two sides of the strait. He said: Of course, the complete 
solution of problems is most important. Both sides should sit 
down to discuss the reunification of the country. If we can 
realize the peaceful reunification of the country, we will have 
something good to tell our forefathers and posterity and open a 
new page in the annals of the Chinese nation. 
  On the occasion of commemorating the 15th anniversary of the 
publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," the 
joyous New Year's Day of 1994 happens to be drawing near. Cheng 
Siyuan very happily extended festive greetings to compatriots in 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to other compatriots living 
overseas. He expressed the hope that they will continue to show 
concern for and support the motherland's reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization drive on the mainland, and contribute, 
through various forms, to the early realization of the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Presidential spokesman 
Raymond Tai said Tuesday [4 January] that Premier Lien Chan is 
engaging in successful "vacation diplomacy" in Malaysia and 
Singapore. 
  "It is encouraging, and will surely contribute to future 
cooperation with those countries," Tai said in a regular 
presidential press conference. 
  Lien began his two-leg private visit last Thursday. He has 
already met with the leaders and other ranking officials of the 
two Southeast Asian countries. 
  Tai said Lien's current trip is a realization of the 
"practical diplomacy" initiated by President Li Teng-hui. He 
said, however, that Li does not have plans to visit any foreign 
countries in the near future. 
  According to a CNA dispatch, meanwhile, Premier Lien and his 
wife spent a happy Tuesday in Singapore. 
  Lien started the day by playing golf with Singaporean Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong in the morning, and then took a ride on 
the Mass Rapid Transit [railway] system and toured the city in 
the afternoon. 
  Lien and his wife were honored by Senior Minister Li Kuan 
Yew 
at a dinner party held at the presidential office Tuesday night. 
Several Singaporean cabinet ministers were also in attendance. 
  Lien will leave Singapore Wednesday, winding up his first 
overseas trip since he assumed the premiership early last year.

  The Foreign Affairs Ministry is still trying to safeguard

  He said the reported diplomatic breakup could be confirmed

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- The energy cooperation 
working group under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum will sponsor an energy resources development seminar in 
Taipei next month, government sources reported Tuesday [4 
January]. 
  It is the first time Taiwan has been chosen to host an APEC 
seminar since the regional economic cooperation organization was 
formed in 1989, the sources said. 
  The seminar, to be held February 1-3, will focus on new 
energy technologies, energy conservation, more efficient uses of 
energy resources, transformation of waste into energy, the 
environmental impact of energy resources exploration, and 
regional cooperation in energy development. 
  The government-funded Industrial Technology Research 
Institute will organize the seminar with the assistance of 
Japan's New Technology Development Organization. 
  Energy administrators and experts from all APEC member 
states 
are expected to attend the seminar. APEC groups 17 economies, 
including the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, 
Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Brunei, Papua New Guinea and Mexico. 
  The Republic of China [ROC] expressed its intention to host 
the seminar in October 1992, but the APEC energy working group 
did not make a final decision on the site of the meeting until 
late last year for fear of offending Beijing. 
  APEC has in the past organized short-term study tours of 
Taiwan, but has never sponsored a formal session here. 
  APEC has nine working groups. Aside from the energy task 
force, it has panels responsible for manpower resources 
planning, technology transfer, telecommunications, fishery 
resources, transportation, tourism, trade promotion and 
investment cooperation.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- A second delegation from 
the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species 
(CITES) is scheduled to visit Taiwan later this month to 
reassess Taiwan's wildlife conservation efforts. 
  CITES spokesman Le Duc said the delegation will be comprised 
of four or five standing committee members, who will deliver a 
report to the full committee in March in Geneva, after which a 
final decision will be made on whether to recommend trade 
sanctions against Taiwan. 
  The CITES standing committee voted 3-3 in a September 
meeting 
last year to postpone trade sanctions proposed by Britain's 
Environmental Investigation Agency, which claimed Taiwan had 
only perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino 
horn and tiger parts. 
  The first CITES delegation -- a lower-ranking trio -- 
visited 
Taiwan Nov. 28-Dec. 2. Its report was positive on Taiwan's 
conservation efforts. 
  Murray Hosking, a CITES standing committee member from New 
Zealand, will lead the second CITES delegation to Taiwan around 
the end of January after the delegation visits South Korea, Le 
Duc said.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Tibet's spiritual leader, 
the Dalai Lama, is likely to visit Taiwan in March, an official 
with the Mongolian &amp; Tibetan Affairs Commission said Tuesday 
[4 
January]. 
  The Dalai Lama has repeatedly expressed a desire to visit 
Taiwan, and earlier reports said he would visit this month. 
  The official said the commission welcomes the Dalai Lama to 
preach on the island, noting that the number of Buddhists in the 
Dalai Lama's sect has been on the rise here. 
  The Dalai Lama has on several occasions given credit to 
Taiwan for its political democratization, prosperity, and 
freedom of press and religion, the official indicated. "He 
should come here to learn for himself the situation about 
Taiwan." 
  The Dalai Lama has been in exile in India since he fled 
Tibet 
in 1959 after mainland Chinese troops crushed an uprising there.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Unrealistic Beijing Policy"] </F>
  [Text] It is regrettable that the five-day talks between 
Taiwan and Mainland China have jailed to reach agreement on any 
of the three major issues -- repatriation of hijackers and 
illegal immigrants and how to settle fishing disputes. 
  But the fact that the bilateral discussions were held here 
for the first time did provide local citizens with a personal 
opportunity to find how unrealistic the communist-held mainland 
is in dealing with Taiwan. 
  This personal finding should go a long way toward building a 
consensus over the government's mainland policies. Many 
businessmen, politicians and a lot of members in the general 
public in the past have consistently criticized the government 
for being too slow in improving relations with the mainland. 
  It is not the government that does not want to normalize 
relations with Beijing. In fact, Taipei has always been trying 
to do that. The problem is that Beijing has stubbornly refused 
to recognize this government and to respect its jurisdiction 
over Taiwan. 
  It is this unreasonable stance of Beijing that once again 
prevented the solution of the three thorny issues in the Taipei 
round of bilateral talks. This Beijing position was expressed 
by its negotiators throughout the five-day discussions. 
  For example, the Beijing negotiators contended that the 
entry 
of mainland people into Taiwan can be viewed as illegal only 
when they also break relevant regulation of the mainland. Why 
Beijing has such a view is apparently because it thinks Taiwan 
is a province of Mainland China and thus its people travel to 
this island does not constitute a crime of illegal entry. 
  This is ridiculous. If Beijing continues to stick to its 
unrealistic Taiwan policies and ignores the fact that Taiwan and 
the mainland are politically divided and that this island has 
its own legitimate government and independent judicial system, 
there will never be a day for the two sides to normalize 
relations. 
  Despite the failure to reach any agreement in the latest 
round of talks, local negotiators should be lauded for their 
firm position on protecting Taiwan's jurisdiction and 
sovereignty. To yield on this most important matter means to 
acquiesce in communist rule.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Two-way trade between 
Taiwan and Mainland China will continue to grow this year, but 
at a slower pace than before, the Ministry of Economic Affairs 
said Tuesday [4 January]. 
  The ministry predicted that indirect trade across the Taiwan 
strait will reach U.S.$20 billion in 1994, up from 1993's 
estimated U.S.$15 billion. It noted that imports from the 
mainland should increase this year, but mainland-bound shipments 
may not grow as fast as last year. 
  Taiwan exports to the mainland grew by 42 percent in 1991, 
and by only 34 percent in 1992. In the first nine months of 
1993, the rate dropped to 25 percent. 
  Imports from the mainland jumped 47 percent in 1991 from the 
year-earlier level, but declined 0.6 percent in 1992. Mainland 
imports dropped 3 percent in the first nine months of 1993 
compared with the same period of the previous year. 
  Ministry officials said imports from the mainland are 
expected to increase this year because the government has 
further eased import restrictions and mainland goods have become 
more competitive following the recent depreciation of the 
mainland currency against the U.S. dollar. 
  The officials also expected Taiwan's reliance on the 
mainland 
market to climb in coming years. Cross-strait trade accounted 
for 4.16 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade in 1991. The 
percentage rose to 4.83 percent in 1992 and surged to an 
all-time high of 5.28 percent in the January-September period of 
1993. 
  In terms of exports, Taiwan has become even more reliant on 
the mainland, the officials warned. In 1987, exports to the 
mainland made up a mere 2.29 percent of Taiwan's total outbound 
shipments, but the share rose to 8.83 percent in the first nine 
months of last year. 
  Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Taiwan 
residents remitted U.S.$187.73 million to the mainland through 
local banks in the first 10 months of 1993, an average of 
U.S.$352,000 a day. Because the government still bans direct 
cross-strait financial exchanges, the money was remitted mostly 
via Hong Kong or other areas. 
  A total of U.S.$493.13 million in Taiwan money was 
indirectly 
remitted to the mainland between May 1990 and October 1993. The 
figure did not include money brought to the mainland by Taiwan 
residents personally.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- With Economic Affairs 
Minister P.K. Chiang's remarks on Taiwan's policy toward 
Mainland China becoming the focus of attention late last year, 
the ministry he chairs is expected to continue to play a leading 
role in the cabinet for the new year. 
  Chiang said at a press conference following a ministerial 
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 
Seattle in November that Taiwan "is taking a step-by-step 
approach toward a two-China policy." 
  Although Chiang later explained that his statement was 
simply 
aimed at refuting mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 
remarks that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of 
China [ROC], his words have still been a subject of much 
controversy. 
  The Taipei government has reiterated that its goal of 
pursuing China's eventual peaceful reunification has not changed. 
  In late December, the minister said he would ask the cabinet 
to consider opening direct shipping links across the Taiwan 
strait on a city-to-city or harbor-to-harbor basis in order to 
help local manufacturers reduce transportation costs. The 
proposal drew a mixed reaction. 
  Taiwan currently only allows indirect trade, transportation, 
and mail connections with the mainland in accordance with its 
national unification guidelines, which set phased goals for the 
development of cross-strait ties. 
  Observers here said Chiang's two politically sensitive 
statements were enough to make him 1993's "man of the year" in 
Taiwan. 
  Since assuming his ministerial post in February 1993 after 
having served as a vice minister of economic affairs, Chiang has 
plunged intensively into his work. He placed priority on 
Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), rallied efforts to avert possible trade sanctions by the 
United States, and started to promote Taiwan as a business 
operations center in the Asia-Pacific. 
  Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, aims to become a full member this year. In late April, 
Taiwan was put on the American "priority watch list" targeted 
for trade retaliation. 
  Chiang's efforts at making Taiwan an Asia-Pacific hub reaped 
bountiful success when strategic alliances with 11 foreign 
enterprises, including American companies AT&amp;T, Motorola, 
General Electric, Carpenter, and General Motors Corp., Holland's 
Philips Co., and ABB of Sweden, were formed. 
  Transfers of advanced technology from these multinationals 
are expected to help upgrade Taiwan's industrial base, while 
these firms in turn could use Taiwan as a gateway to tap the 
vast Southeast Asian and mainland Chinese markets. 
  Chiang stumbled, however, in talks over the proposed joint 
venture between Taiwan Aerospace Corp. and British Aerospace plc 
(BAE) to produce and market BAE-developed regional passenger 
jetliners. The talks deadlocked at the end of the year. 
  Moreover, Taiwan last year suffered its most serious drought 
in 39 years, underscoring the importance of preserving water 
resources to the minister and other officials. 
  For the new year, a load of work is already piling up for 
Chiang. 
  Taiwan's talks with the United States on tariff concessions 
are to be held later this month, and negotiations with 
respective GATT contracting parties will start in February. In 
addition, March will see the United States review trade 
practices of countries placed under the priority watch list. 
  Chiang also has to place emphasis on growing cross-strait 
trade, which will be key to Taiwan's economic development. 
Cross-strait trade is expected to top US$20 billion this year, 
up substantially from 1993's US$15 billion. 
  Judging from the tasks ahead, Chiang and his ministry will 
have to work hard to win Taiwan a role on the world stage.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Solemn Mission -- on the </F>
Meetings of Various Subcommittees Under the Preliminary Working 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's 
Preparatory Committee in Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Coming on the heels of 
the new year, the various subcommittees under the Preliminary 
Working Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region's [SAR] Preparatory Committee will hold successive 
meetings in Beijing to study and make suggestions on the Hong 
Kong SAR's political, economic, and legal affairs. Intensifying 
the PWC's work following the complete destruction [che di po 
huai 1796 1646 4275 0975] of the Sino-British talks by the 
British Government and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten carries 
vital significance for ensuring China's resumption of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong, for effecting a smooth transition in 
1997, and for achieving long-term stability and prosperity in 
Hong Kong. 
  Resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong is a common aspiration 
of 
all Chinese people. For a long time since the end of the Opium 
War in 1840, China suffered all kinds of aggression by Britain 
and other imperialist powers; its sovereignty was violated, its 
people were humiliated, and it suffered territorial losses and 
breakups. Generation after generation of our forefathers did not 
hesitate to shed their blood and make sacrifices as they 
advanced in an endless stream to end this history of 
humiliation. The Chinese nation was able to stand on its own 
feet only after the PRC was founded in 1949. Three and a half 
years from now on, Hong Kong -- a piece of territory occupied by 
Britain for more than a century -- will return to the fold of 
the motherland. Once we resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
the entire world will see that the sovereignty will be complete 
and real; in other words, we will not exercise the kind of 
fragmented, nominal, and empty "sovereignty" -- that proposed by 
the British Government in the past -- which aims at continuing 
British rule over Hong Kong by separating "sovereignty" and "the 
right to rule." All Chinese people who champion national 
interests -- including the vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots 
-- and all patriots will heartily support this solemn stand of 
the motherland. 
  After the PWC's formation, the British Hong Kong authorities 
and a handful of people who are eager to stir up trouble have 
gone through restless nights and days; like people who whistle 
to drive away their fears when they walk on the street at night, 
they have made defamatory remarks about the PWC from time to 
time. Patten has prated about so-called "public trust" in the 
PWC, although people can see that he himself feels that his 
remarks are lame. Is a British politician who would not forego 
his colonialist interests qualified to criticize as lacking in 
public trust a working body authorized by China's supreme organ 
of power? Consider Britain's actions when it was forced to 
retreat from its colonies one after another. What public trust 
did it ever have? Conversely, we will certainly win the 
public's trust if we respect our own nation, sincerely support 
the motherland's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
contribute our talents and efforts to maintaining Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability, and work realistically to implement 
the Basic Law and the "one country and two systems" in Hong 
Kong. Mr. Patten and a few individuals who talk and act wildly 
cannot vilify the broadly representative PWC and its fruitful 
work. 
  PWC members are working hard to defend China's sovereignty, 
to let Hong Kong exercise a high degree of autonomy within the 
context of the Basic Law and effect a smooth transition in 1997, 
and to create a better future for Hong Kong. They carry the 
great trust of more than 1.1 billion Chinese people, as well as 
a solemn mission. We would like to pay our high tribute to them. 
Their work will write an illustrious page in China's history. 
We wish the meetings success.

Kong"] 
  [Text] If We Had Known It Would Come to This, 
Different Actions Would Have Been Taken 
  The door to Sino-British talks has finally closed. What will 
be the next step taken by China then, and how will Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability be maintained through "self-reliance"? 
These are not only questions for which people overseas are 
showing great concern, but also questions raised by many people 
in China. 
  In Beijing, some democratic personages whom I know very well 
have raised the following questions in private talks as if by 
prior agreement: 
  "Have violent changes taken place in Hong Kong?" 
  "Has Chris Patten put Hong Kong in a wretched state?" 
  "Has the Sino-British Joint Declaration been unilaterally 
abandoned by the British side?" 
  "If we had known it would come to this, we would have acted 
differently. Since China and Britain are sharing the same bed 
but dreaming different dreams, we should not have suggested 
cooperation in the transitional period long ago. Could we not 
see the `sequel' now?" 
  These people did not pay much attention to the Hong Kong 
issue before, but how do they appear to be experts now? After 
making inquiries, I learned that, recently, the CPC has in 
various relevant units whipped up opinion about and made great 
efforts to expose Britain's "schemes and intrigues" on the Hong 
Kong issue. Apart from the need to speak along the same lines 
externally, the practice is also aimed at unifying people's 
thinking within the country. 
  To the executors of the CPC's policies on Hong Kong and 
Macao, turning against the British is both a bad thing and a 
good thing. If Hong Kong's transition is smooth and anything 
unexpected happens in Hong Kong after 1997, the responsibility 
will rest on the Chinese side. Now that the British side has 
put forth Chris Patten's package and the Chinese side has 
thoroughly criticized it, once anything bad happens in Hong Kong 
in the future, the responsibility will rest on the side of the 
British colonialists. 
<H3>  Lu Ping: Seeds of Trouble Buried by the British Side Will 
Be Intolerable </H3>
  On 15 December, on behalf of the State Council, Lu Ping, 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Jiang 
Enzhu, representative of the Chinese side in the Sino-British 
talks, held a special meeting in the Guangdong Hall of the Great 
Hall of the People to brief the leaders of various democratic 
parties and mass organizations on the situation of the 
Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political system. They also 
answered questions raised by the participants. 
  Lu Ping spoke first. He said: The British authorities have 
made use of Hong Kong's transitional period and have 
intentionally raised a political challenge against the Chinese 
Government. Judging from its usual practice before withdrawing 
from its colonies, it is by no means a new strategy. Before the 
signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese 
Government and relevant departments had already made certain 
ideological preparations. In the spring of 1990, we made 
several concrete preparations. Now, in our preparatory work, we 
must grasp the work firmly and substantively on the one hand 
and, on the other, pay close attention to violent changes in 
Hong Kong's political and economic fields created by the British 
side and the development of trends. We must be prepared to deal 
with such changes. Now, work concerning arrangements for this 
has already been completed. China will not allow and will not 
tolerate Britain willfully creating and burying seeds of 
political disturbance and economic collapse in Hong Kong during 
the transitional period. 
<H3>  "Six Basic Factors Concerning Britain's Challenge Against 
the Chinese Government" </H3>
  What are the "seeds of political disturbance and economic 
collapse"? Lu Ping made a detailed analysis of this. He 
believes that Britain changed its China policy and presented a 
challenge to the Chinese Government for the following basic 
reasons: 
  1. Mistakes in analyzing and assessing China's political 
situation. 
  2. Mistakes in understanding China's resolution and 
timetable for taking back Hong Kong's sovereignty and 
administrative power. 
  3. An erroneous estimation of the ability of the Chinese 
Government and Chinese people, including patriotic compatriots 
in Hong Kong, to administer Hong Kong. 
  4. An attempt to make use of the changes in the 
international political climate, the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union, and the changes in eastern Europe to change its 
policy and strategy on China. 
  5. A belief that since China and Hong Kong maintain close 
economic relations at present, China will not take over Hong 
Kong earlier even if Britain violates the three documents. 
  6. A belief that since Hong Kong's economy plays a 
positive role in the Chinese economy, and the United States, 
Japan, and other countries have investments in Hong Kong, China 
will tolerate Britain extending its colonialist rule under the 
economic card. 
<H3>  Lu Ping Indirectly Admits That Sino-British Joint 
Declaration Has Become Ineffective </H3>
  Judging from the six factors summed up by Lu Ping, in the 
eyes of the Chinese side, Britain has attempted to "go its own 
way" in Hong Kong because it has made a wrong appraisal of the 
situation and has thus buried "seeds of trouble" there, which 
may lead to political disturbances and economic collapse. But 
many participants in the meeting asked for an explanation of 
these anti-British remarks. One of the questions raised by the 
participants, with which people were showing the greatest 
concerns for, was whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as 
an international agreement, would continue to be effective. 
  Lu Ping gave the following answer to this delicate question: 
As the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been repeatedly 
damaged and undermined, its existence and binding force have 
lost their legitimate significance and it cannot play its due 
role. This is common knowledge in international relations. 
Britain has brazenly gone against to the written agreement and 
understandings between the two governments. This is a rare 
practice in international contacts. Therefore, we will make a 
resolute decision in light of the development of the trend. The 
timetable is in our hands. All independent countries put their 
sovereignty and overall interests of the state above everything 
else. 
  These remarks show that Lu Ping has indirectly admitted that 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration has already become 
ineffective and the Chinese side, with sovereignty in its hands, 
may even take preemptive measures rather than striking only 
after the other side has struck. 
  From this, people can see that the Chinese side has made 
certain tactical changes in its Hong Kong policy. It has 
emphasized that "the timetable is in our hands." This is not 
merely intimidation. With the breakdown of Sino-British talks 
and its hypocritical face unveiled, the Chinese side can do 
whatever it wants to do "with perfect assurance." 
<H5>  "Correcting the Right Deviationist Policy Toward Britain" </H5>
  In this stage, while China is "calmly waiting for change," 
the military is still adopting a very active attitude. In 
mid-October, soon after the conclusion of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, eight generals, 
including Zhang Aiping, a former defense minister and currently 
a member of the Central Military Commission's consultative 
committee, Xiao Ke, Hong Xuezhi, Li Desheng, Wang Ping, Yang 
Dezhi, Qin Jiwei, and Zhao Nanqi stated their views to the 
Central Committee and the State Council, saying "it is time to 
end the colonialist rule now and to sum up and rectify the right 
deviationist policy of cherishing unrealistic illusions toward 
the British Government"! 
  This is what the servicemen of the older generation are 
thinking, but they have just expressed their views with slogans. 
Top military officers in charge of concrete work have even more 
concrete ideas. At the beginning of December, Zhang Wannian, 
chief of the general staff, Yu Yongbo, director of the General 
Political Department, and Fu Quanyou, director of the General 
Logistics Department, together with Defense Minister Chi 
Haotian, Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming, and Navy Commander 
Zhang Lianzhong, submitted a statement of their views to the CPC 
Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission, entitled "We must safeguard national sovereignty and 
end colonialist rule." In the statement, they put forth the 
following five proposals: 
<H3>  Five Proposals Made by the Military Have Strong Smell of 
Gunpowder </H3>
  1. The so-called dispute over the political system at 
present is a favorite trick of the British colonialists before 
withdrawing from their colonies and is a deliberate political 
challenge after the British authorities changed their strategy 
toward China. It is necessary to expose it and fight back. 
  2. It is necessary to make preparations for taking resolute 
measures against Britain if it brings disasters in economic 
affairs, supports pro-British and anti-China hostile forces in 
the political field, and, internationally, creates an 
international political city. 
  3. Since the British authorities have abandoned the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements reached 
between the Chinese and British governments and have caused the 
situation to deteriorate further, it is necessary to adopt 
measures immediately and make a resolute decision: Take back 
Hong Kong immediately and implement the policy of one country, 
two systems under the leadership of the government of the PRC. 
  4. The Chinese Government should warn the British 
authorities sternly once again through diplomatic channels that 
it should immediately stop playing political tricks, rein in 
from the brink of the precipice, return to the basis of carrying 
out the Sino-British Joint Declaration and agreements reached 
between the two governments, and stop interfering with China's 
sovereignty and internal affairs, otherwise colonialist rule 
will be ended immediately without hesitation and further 
tolerance. 
  5. At the current stage, China should recall its ambassador 
to Britain and terminate ministerial contacts and intercourse 
with Britain. 
<H3>  Liu Huaqing Predicts British Colonialism Will Be Eradicated 
Very Soon </H3>
  Judging from this written statement, which has a strong 
smell 
of gunpowder, the military has not only been well prepared all 
the time to take "resolute measures," but has also asked for the 
downgrading of Sino-British diplomatic relations. Such "over 
reactive" remarks have never been seen before. People are 
speculating that this may have something to do with 
encouragement by Liu Huaqing, a member of the CPC's Political 
Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. 
Talking about Hong Kong's situation during a recent meeting 
with the officers in charge of military regions, Liu Huaqing 
said: To resolve the Hong Kong issue is nothing complicated and 
difficult. The central authorities have policies and principles 
ready. We just want to see what antics the British authorities 
will go on to play. How can Hong Kong's future and Hong Kong's 
destiny be decided by British colonialists? We have no right to 
oppose the antics they are playing, but we absolutely have the 
right to end British colonialist rule and eradicate 
British-style colonialism early. Judging from current 
developments, this day will come very soon. 
  "This day will come very soon." This is an important view. 
However, at present, there are no signs of disturbances in Hong 
Kong's society and people are seizing the current opportunities 
and making use of the limited time to make money. Just as 
people are saying: "When you have money, you can do anything, 
but if you have no money, you can just follow the Basic Law." 
Under such a situation, how can man-made "political 
disturbances" and "economic collapse" be created so that guns 
can be used to take over Hong Kong ahead of time? It seems that 
it will be difficult for the CPC to make its next move. "Moving 
the wrong piece on the chess board may lose the whole game...."

(6056 2450 0448) in Beijing: "New Orientation of Beijing's 
Policy Toward Hong Kong in 1994: To Win Hong Kong People's 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] According to authoritative sources in Beijing, the 
major orientation of the Beijing government's policy towards 
Hong Kong is: First, it will try every possible means to 
strengthen unity among Hong Kong citizens at all levels, 
cooperate with them to safeguard stability and prosperity in the 
post-transition period, and do a good job in preparation for a 
smooth transfer of political power; second, it will increase the 
membership of the Preparatory Work Committee [PWC], broaden the 
PWC's representativeness, and coordinate the PWC with relevant 
united front work; third, it will keep trying to attract 
investment from Hong Kong, with the focus of the capital inflow 
on communications and transportation and other tertiary 
industries, but a number of "policy restrictions" will be set on 
the retailing and real estate industries; fourth, it will make 
full use of the fund-raising channel in Hong Kong to allow more 
state-owned enterprises to be listed on the Hong Kong stock 
market and to support various localities to attract investment 
in Hong Kong in a normal way; and fifth, it will look out for 
all forces which try to carry out "peaceful evolution" 
conspiracies in mainland China and pay attention to 
"counter-liberalization" work. 
  Sino-British relations deteriorated in 1993 because of the 
wrangle over and the break in the talks over Hong Kong 
elections, and the Beijing government has altered the original 
idea of cooperating with the British side to fulfill the goal of 
a "smooth transition" and has instead adopted the strategy of 
cooperating with the Chinese people in Hong Kong to safeguard 
stability in the transition period. The Chinese side has not 
completely closed the door to talks. As long as Governor Patten 
revokes the draft election bill which has been tabled in the 
Legislative Council, it will be possible to restart the talks. 
However, the Chinese side does not place great hopes on this. 
  In 1994, Beijing will speed up the PWC's work. First, it 
will announce a new group of PWC members as soon as possible. 
According to sources close to those organs in charge of Hong 
Kong and Macao work, as far as new PWC members are concerned, 
there will be a small number of "moderate democrats," such as 
Cheung Ping-leung of Meeting Point, presidents of post-secondary 
colleges, will be appointed, and efforts will also be made to 
gradually recruit people from religious circles, the social 
service sector, and the grass roots. 
  As far as the economic sphere is concerned, the Beijing 
government will strive to persuade Hong Kong businessmen to 
invest more in tertiary industry (the service sector). Tertiary 
industry in the mainland is still far behind that of most 
developing countries, and its output value only accounts for 27 
percent of overall GNP, which is lower than the world average. 
In the new year, the Beijing government will vigorously develop 
tertiary industry and increase employment opportunities and 
national income. Its development pattern will be in line with 
1993's State Council document No. 20--The "Basic Thinking on the 
Development Plan for Tertiary Industry Throughout the Country." 
Because of insufficient capital, one of the foci of attracting 
foreign capital is to strive for the participation of Hong Kong 
businessmen in tertiary industry. 
  According to the policy on tertiary industry drafted by the 
Foreign Investment Administration of the State Council Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Beijing 
government encourages businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 
other foreign countries to develop vast stretches of land. The 
State Council will relax restrictions on some provincial and 
city economic development zones and strive for the participation 
of large, listed [on the Hong Kong stock exchange] real estate 
companies in the development of vast stretches land. However, 
certain restrictions on real estate investment must be imposed 
on Hong Kong businessmen, and one of the restrictions is to 
strictly examine and approve investments in luxury houses, 
villas, resorts, and golf courses. Moreover, Hong Kong 
businessmen will be encouraged to take part in the 
reconstruction of old city areas and to invest in ordinary 
commodity houses. 
  Various local governments will also "impose strict control" 
over land supply. Last year, land use rights sold by Shanghai 
Municipality were reduced to three square km (20 square km in 
1992), and the supply of land in Shenzhen City also dropped to 
32 hectares in 1993 from 45 hectares in 1992. In the new year, 
various localities will still impose appropriate controls on the 
supply of land. 
  The Beijing government is still opening the retailing 
industry and tertiary industry to Hong Kong businessmen, but 
some official restrictions have been imposed on running 
supermarkets. The main points of the restrictions are: 
Businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries are 
not allowed to run supermarkets and wholesale businesses alone. 
In the five special economic zones and five cities and 
municipalities, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and 
Dalian, Sino-foreign joint ventures are allowed, to run one to 
two supermarkets and to run retailing businesses on a 
cooperative basis with special approval. 
  In the new year, the largest area invested in by Hong Kong 
businessmen will be communications and transportation. Apart 
from investing in railways and ports, Hong Kong businessmen can 
also build solely invested wharfs reserved specially for owners 
of goods, run airport terminals and airlines through joint 
ventures, and so on.

<F P=106> [Article by Cheng Teh-lin (6774 1795 2651): "The Military </F>
Appreciates Jiang Zemin's Trip to Seattle"] 
  [Text] Deng Xiaoping Was All for Jiang Zemin Making a 
Trip to the United States 
  According to a well informed source in Beijing, between 
mid-November and early December last year, as head of state, 
Jiang Zemin, concurrently state president, Central Military 
Commision chairman, and General Secretary of the CPC Central 
Committee, was in Seattle to participate in the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference. In its wake, he met 
U.S. President Clinton, and visited Cuba, Brazil and Portugal. 
His trip was highly appreciated by the Chinese military. The 
Army, Navy and Air Force, all branches of the services, the 
Defense Ministry, all military regions, advanced military 
institutes and academies have sent letters and cables to salute 
and extend regards to Jiang Zemin. This is a rare situation in 
China's political life. 
  Originally, some leading members of the military -- 
including 
some old generals -- wrote to the Central Committee to express 
their hope that Jiang Zemin would refrain from attending the 
Seattle summit on the grounds that the United States had pursued 
a series of incidents to oppose China and intervene in its 
internal affairs. These include the "Yin He" incident and the 
U.S. Congress' opposition to China's application for the 2000 
World Olympics, as well as the false charge that China provided 
guided missiles for Pakistan. They said China should respond to 
these things and not endure the bullying of U.S. hegemony and 
power politics. Some even suggested de-escalation of Sino-U.S. 
diplomatic relations, recalling the Chinese ambassador to the 
United States, and so forth. Later, the CPC Political Bureau 
Standing Committee sought instructions from Deng Xiaoping, who 
stated: It is better that he should go, for he can express 
China's position so as to promote understanding. Thus the 
Standing Committee made the decision on Jiang Zemin leaving for 
the United States to meet President Clinton. At the same time, 
Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen -- the two Central Military 
Commission vice chairmen -- together with CPC senior statesmen 
Wan Li and Bo Yibo, went separately to do ideological work among 
the military and old generals. Facts have demonstrated the 
correctness of Deng Xiaoping's decision. 
<H5>  Chi Haotian on Three Major Events </H5>
  On Jiang Zemin's return to Bejing, Colonel General Chi 
Haotian, member of the Central Military Commission and 
concurrently minister of defense, at an 8 December Defense 
Ministry report meeting, appraised Jiang Zemin's trip highly, 
saying: Three major events took place in our party, country and 
Army in November: 1) The report meeting on Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaopeng presided over by General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin; 2) The successful conclusion of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, presided over by 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, at which the historical document 
on building the socialist market economic structure was adopted; 
and 3) Jiang Zemin, in his capacity as state president, went to 
Seattle by inviation to participate in the APEC conference. 
During a meeting with U.S. President Clinton, he frankly [tan 
shuai di 0982 3764 0966] set out the Chinese Government's 
principle stand and views on a series of incidents, while 
adhering to the Chinese Government's wishes to improve bilateral 
relations on the basis of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques. 
<H5>  Zhang Zhen Says the Military Supports Jiang </H5>
  On 6 December, two days before Chi Haotian made his speech, 
Zhang Zhen attended a discussion meeting for senior coaches of 
the three military institutes, He dealt with the world situation 
and stressed Jiang Zemin's mid-November trip to Seattle. Zhang 
said: Our respectful Comrade Jiang Zemin, chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, went to Seattle on invitation to 
participate in the APEC conference. He held a Sino-U.S. summit 
with Clinton there, during which he explicitly expressed China's 
persistent principle stand, the hope for China and the United 
States to proceed toward world peace and the long-range friendly 
cooperation of the two countries in seeking common ground while 
resolving differences. He was neither haughty nor humble. 
Zhang added: Whether in the past, the present, or the future, 
China will never barter away its sovereignty and principles; the 
Chinese people have a deep understanding that nothing is more 
precious than the country's independence and initiative. 
History -- in which the Chinese people suffered the aggression, 
bullying and plundering of foreign powers -- will never be 
repeated. At the Sino-U.S. summit, President Jiang Zemin 
expressed the Chinese Government's position to the whole world, 
and won the support of peace-loving, independent countries 
throughout. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, in its 
entirety, is proud of and inspired by Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the supreme leader of the party,state and Army. 
  In addition, all military regions have held report meetings 
to express their support for Jiang Zemin's leadership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "report": "CIA Destroyed Files on Human </F>
Radiation Testing"] 
  [Text] Washington, January 4 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) had destroyed documents on radioactive 
tests it conducted on human beings during the Cold War, news 
reports said today. 
  Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists 
said the full extent of the testing may never be known to the 
public. 
  Aftergood told the REUTERS News Service that the CIA 
conducted covert radiation tests from 1953 to 1967 but many 
files on the tests were destroyed in 1973. 
  The revelation came one day after the establishment of a 
joint task force that would coordinate the investigation efforts 
by about half a dozen of government departments on the tests. 
  The inter-agency probe would involve the Energy Department, 
the Defense Department, the Veterans Affairs Department and the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
  The White House said it expects that the CIA would cooperate 
with the government-wide investigation of the tests, probably 
involved some 800 U.S. citizens, some without knowing the nature 
of the testings. 
  Media reports said the testing subjects included retarded 
children fed radioactive milk and cereal and inmates received x- 
rays. 
  Aftergood said CIA had also done drug testing and "the drug 
testing was part of a larger program which included studies on 
the effects of radiation and a number of other things."

<F P=106> [By Kang Xingwen: "EC's New Year Endeavor: Strengthening of </F>
Anti-Dumping Measures"] 
  [Text] Brussels, January 5 (XINHUA) -- In what was seen as 
a new year attempt to protect the European market and break out 
of serious recession, the European Community (EC) has quietly 
strengthened anti-dumping measures against foreign goods. 
  The first action the EC commission has taken since new 
year's 
day was to work out a lengthy list which covers a wide-range of 
foreign goods and adopt broad anti-dumping measures which are of 
long-term duration, according to EC officials. 
  The commission has also voted to keep up the momentum of a 
package of anti-dumping measures adopted five years ago. 
  The anti-dumping list, put forward by the EC commission 
Monday, covers polyester fibers manufactured by South Korea, 
Turkey and Taiwan and ferrosilicon from Norway, Iceland, Sweden 
and Venezuela. 
  Chinese made photo-albums, lighters and paracetamol (a kind 
of aspirin) are also included in the list. 
  Apart from albums, a number of other Chinese goods have been 
placed under permanent anti-dumping tariffs since 1988. 
  Under relevant EC laws, "permanent anti-dumping measures" 
are 
normally effective for a term of five years and the EC 
commission decides to continue or cancel the measures when they 
reach the end of the five-year term, in accordance with changes 
in the marketplace. 
  The term "market changes" here normally means that under 
strict anti-dumping measures, the competitiveness of foreign 
goods is greatly weakened and imported goods are taking an 
increasingly smaller share of the EC market. 
  The anti-dumping measures in the past either generally 
expired or were reduced at the end of the five-year term if they 
genuinely achieved the desired target. 
  But, as the EC is still locked in a serious recession and 
there is no sign of recovery, the EC commission has decided to 
maintain or prolong the anti-dumping measures adopted five years 
ago as they are regarded as very effective in having protected 
European business interests. 
  In 1988, Chinese exports of paracetamol to the EC soared to 
234 tons and the community rushed to impose a price limit of six 
dollars a ton upon the drug at the end of that year. 
  As a result the figures declined sharply in 1992 to only 61 
tons. 
  But the EC commission now believes that the European market 
should be protected continually and has proposed maintaining the 
imposition of anti-dumping tariffs upon the import of Chinese 
paracetamol. 
  Analysts here believe the EC's anti-dumping measures are 
designed to protect Europe's market, business and economy which 
have been hit hard by the lingering recession. 
  But analysts warn that the community may have forgotten that 
while restricting the sale of foreign goods, it has at the same 
time built up a barrier against its own exports. 
  Meanwhile, the EC has been under fire from abroad for 
repeatedly increasing subsidies which are intended to stimulate 
its exports and spur an economic recovery in Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Chu Heng-yu (2612 5899 1342): "Comprehensive </F>
Economic Reform, Tight Political Control--Theme of 1994"] 
  [Excerpt] After the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee adopted the "Decision on Several Questions 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" in November 1993, the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council held a national economic work conference 
(conference of governors and mayors) and a series of national 
conferences on planning, taxation, and economic and trade work 
in early December, to plan for work in 1994 and calling for 
efforts to comprehensively carry out economic structural reform 
and do a good job in basic work to complete initially the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure and 
attain "the second-step development objective" by the end of 
this century. 
  The GNP growth rate for 1994 has been set at 9 percent 
(industry will be 15 percent and agriculture 3 percent). 
<H3>  Deng Again Urges Seizing Opportunities and Developing the 
Economy </H3>
  Recently, Deng Xiaoping said to CPC leaders: The 
document adopted by the 14th CPC Central Committee at its Third 
Plenary Session is pretty good. It has novelty. What counts is 
to see how many solid things will be done next year (1994) in 
accordance with this line of thinking to lay a solid foundation 
for greater development in the last years of this century. As I 
see it, in the coming year, we must still seize opportunities 
and accelerate reform and development, naturally, with 
efficiency. Reform is aimed at solving this problem. The 
current international and domestic situation is to our 
advantage. Without too much trouble facing us, now is precisely 
a good opportunity for us to concentrate our energy on 
developing the economy. Your tasks in the coming year are not 
easy. While we old people are still around and can still make 
suggestions on certain issues and offer help if some big 
problems occur, you (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and 
others) must boldly do your work and not be afraid of dangers. 
Overall, in 1992 and 1993, we did pretty well, witnessed 
economic development, political stability, national unity, and 
social progress, and achieved great successes. We must continue 
to work hard in the coming year. We are happy and so are the 
people throughout the country.... These remarks of "great 
encouragement" from Deng Xiaoping served as a stimulus to the 
CPC's top leadership in working out a plan for work in 1994. 
  However, what merits attention is that, although in 1994 the 
CPC will take bigger moves and more measures than in any 
previous years to carry forward economic structural reform, this 
has not evoked any great enthusiastic response among the common 
people on the mainland. On the contrary, quite a considerable 
number of people are indifferent. Answers and statistics 
acquired from the questionnaire-based sample survey on "the 
attitude of the common people across the country toward 
supporting reform," which was recently conducted by some 
mainland sociologists, shows that the common people's sense of 
participation in reform is far below that of the early 1980's. 
People have expressed strong dissatisfaction over such problems 
as "unfairness in distribution," "the widening of the gap 
between rich and poor," "corruption among officials," "poor 
social order and practices," "the wild spread of political 
preaching," and "attempting and accomplishing nothing in 
political structural reform." The sociologists maintained: The 
CPC's decisionmaking body has landed in an error zone: The 
mainland's socialist system is thought to be good in all aspects 
other than weakness in economic strength. The sociologists 
pointed out: If the CPC top leadership does not get out of this 
zone, while carrying out the overall plan for economic 
structural reform on a large scale, they will find it difficult 
to handle social contradictions and crises using other means 
once the plan suffers setbacks. What is worrying is that while 
the mainland is preparing to energetically implement the 
economic reform plan in 1994 and is inadequately prepared in 
terms of public opinion and ideology, "commemorative" activities 
were conducted on a large scale by capitalizing on the "birth 
centenary of Mao Zedong" and activities were sponsored to show 
"100 films on education in patriotism and revolution" in an 
attempt to restore and reestablish the ethical standards and 
norms of traditional socialism and win popular support by means 
of uncritical, non-analytical, and blind eulogies and 
glorification. If this situation continues, this is bound to 
present a serious psychological and mental hindrance to economic 
reform. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by Li Ruihuan, Chinese People's Political </F>
Consultative Conference, CPPCC, chairman, at the Fourth Meeting 
of the Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee 
in Beijing on 28 December] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- Vice chairmen and 
members of the Standing Committee, and comrades: 
  The main topic for discussion at this meeting is to study 
and 
implement the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some 
Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure." This Standing Committee meeting is held 
when Comrade Mao Zedong's birth centenary is being marked. 
Members of the Standing Committee attended a commemoration 
meeting sponsored by the party Central Committee and paid their 
respects to the remains of Chairman Mao. At this standing 
committee meeting, Comrades Qian Qichen and Wen Jiabao made 
important reports on the international situation and the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, respectively. Members of the Standing Committee put 
forward many good opinions and suggestions. This meeting has 
just adopted a "Decision on Studying and Implementing the 
`Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning 
the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure,'" 
and we must conscientiously carry it out. Now I would like to 
discuss several views. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
was another extremely important meeting held in the course of 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization in our country. 
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
held in December 1978, effected the strategic shift of the 
stress of work throughout the party, marking the great beginning 
of reform and opening up in our country. At that time, the 
stress of reform was put on rural areas. The Third Plenary 
Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee, held in October 1984, 
adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on the Reform 
of the Economic Structure," indicating that the reform of the 
economic structure, with the stress on urban areas, was in full 
swing. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, held last month, adopted the "Decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of 
a Socialist Market Economic Structure," signaling that the 
reform of the economic structure in our country has entered the 
period of combining package reform with breakthroughs in key 
areas. This "decision" represents a profound summing up of 
historical experiences since the founding of the PRC, especially 
a profound summing up of experiences in reform and opening to 
the outside world over the past 15 years; and it is an overall 
plan for establishing a socialist market economic structure in 
our country as well as the program of action for reforming the 
economic structure in the nineties. Striving to carry out the 
tasks set out in the "decision" and to effect the transition 
from the old economic structure to a new one is of great 
practical and far-reaching historical significance for further 
liberating and developing the productive forces; accelerating 
the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization; and promoting 
the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Establishing and improving a socialist market economic 
structure is a great system-engineering project, a great 
practice of history- making by the Chinese people. In this 
process, it is inevitable to encounter many hardly predictable 
difficulties and unusually complicated situations. We must keep 
a clear head and make a full assessment of and preparations for 
all of this. We must understand that it is an entirely new 
undertaking to establish a socialist market economic structure. 
Human society thus far only has experience in developing the 
market economy under capitalism, and it is undoubtedly an 
unprecedented exploration to integrate the socialist system 
organically with the market economy. For a fairly long time 
after the founding of the PRC, we considered planning and the 
market to be criteria for distinguishing socialism from 
capitalism and took a critical and rejective attitude toward the 
market economy. As a result, people, including leading cadres 
at various levels, had little or no understanding of the general 
laws and key elements of the market economy. Through reform and 
opening to the outside world over the past decade and more, 
market regulation has gradually expanded; but we still have to 
familiarize ourselves with laws, principles, mechanisms, and 
international practices generally observed in the modern market 
economy. How to persevere in and give play to our political 
superiority under the conditions of a socialist market economy 
is also a new question for study. We must note that 
establishing a socialist market economic structure is a profound 
revolution. For a long time, things from the management system, 
rules, and regulations, to people's way of thinking, work 
methods, and habits in daily life have become suited to the 
planned economy. The development of a socialist market economy 
and the values and the code of conduct required by such 
developments are bound to produce a powerful impact on such 
things. This impact will touch on vast political, economic, and 
cultural spheres as well as on social life and every link of 
work in various regions, departments, and units. This calls for 
making a series of changes in both the economic base and the 
superstructure, remolding our subjective world while changing 
the objective world, practically and effectively strengthening 
the socialist legal system and the building of a socialist 
spiritual civilization, and coordinating all these and making 
them harmonize with the socialist market economic structure so 
as to provide an effective guarantee for a healthy development 
of the socialist market economy. We must note that establishing 
a socialist market economic structure is a very difficult job. 
The decades-old planned economy has left behind many 
long-standing, big, and difficult problems, some of which are 
very hard to solve. In the process of changing to a market 
economic structure, it is hard to avoid causing some new 
economic and social problems. When new contradictions mingle 
with old ones, they will present a complicated picture of good 
and evil, advantages and disadvantages existing side by side. 
This will often make our choice difficult, and there will be 
also many knotty problems to deal with. If reform measures, 
especially those involving the adjustment of the masses' 
immediate interests, are not prudently handled, it could cause 
social turbulence [she hui bo dong 4357 2585 3134 0520]. We 
must note that establishing a socialist market economic 
structure will be a fairly long process. The developed Western 
countries are where they are today because they have employed 
the market economy for several hundred years. In a big Eastern 
country like ours with a weak economic and cultural foundation 
and with a deep-seated influence from the planned economy, we 
just cannot reach our goal of such a deep social change in one 
step even though we have many favorable conditions. Moreover, 
stagnation or even a reversal may occur for various reasons in 
the change from an old structure to a new one. This requires us 
to be mentally prepared to wage a long struggle, to carry out 
overall planning and to take all factors into consideration, to 
do our work in the order of its importance and urgency, and to 
stress continuous and coordinated efforts. In the entire 
process of establishing, developing, and improving a socialist 
market economic structure, there always exists the question of 
how to properly handle the relationship between reform and 
development and stability. Reform is our driving force, 
development is our goal, and stability is the prerequisite. We 
must take the protection of the people's immediate interests as 
the starting point, modestly heed their opinions, attentively 
observe their feelings, grasp the principle of benefiting the 
people and the principle of their tolerance, and strive to make 
all our policy decisions accord with their wishes in order to 
win their support. We must seize reform opportunities, see to it 
that the intensity of reform is proper, take reform into account 
in doing everything, make a correct assessment of the situation, 
try to see from a small clue what is coming, and strive to 
smoothly carry out reforms in a relatively stable and harmonious 
social environment. 
  To accomplish the historic mission of building a socialist 
market economic system and to avoid major twists and turns or 
losses, we must always arm our minds with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. We must assiduously study the recently 
published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, which is the theoretical foundation of the 
socialist market economic system. We must study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's stand, viewpoints, methods, and character so that we 
can become more capable of understanding and rebuilding the 
world. We must integrate theory with reality and constantly sum 
up our experiences so that we can become more aware of the need 
to uphold the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering. 
Through studying the third volume, we must firmly establish the 
ideological line of emancipating our minds and seeking truth 
from facts and be good at upholding the fundamental criteria 
that our work must be conducive to three causes [developing the 
productive forces of the PRC's socialist society, increasing the 
overall strength of the PRC's socialist country, and improving 
the Chinese people's living standards] so that we can creatively 
deal with all sorts of problems arising from the development of 
the socialist market economy. The "decision" has summed up the 
experience that China has gained in launching reforms and 
opening up to the outside world, and we must continue to gain 
more experience from our work under the new historical 
conditions. While the "decision" has outlined the basic 
framework of our socialist market economic system, we must 
reinforce the small parts when we do our work. The "decision" 
is a programmatic document for guiding the nation's reform of 
the economic system, and its implementation must be integrated 
with actual local situations. During their implementation, the 
basic principles and policies stated in the "decision" must 
become the common awareness and actions of people throughout the 
country. The issue of building a socialist market economic 
system is, in the final analysis, an issue of practice. While 
we must set our minds on studying the "decision" painstakingly 
in order to implement it, we must dare to put it into practice. 
We must practice under the guidance of theory, and we must 
study and develop theory during practice. The process of 
practicing, summing up, practicing again, and summing up again 
is the process of the development of China's reform, and it is 
also the process for us to deepen our understanding. We must 
always respect the masses' initiatives. The masses are the 
knowers and the doers, and they are the source of strength for 
reform and construction. While the "decision" has incorporated 
developed countries' applicable experiences in developing their 
market economy, it has summed up the fresh experiences which 
Chinese people have created while launching reforms and opening 
up to the outside world. When the "decision" is being 
implemented, the masses certainly will continue to demonstrate 
their initiatives and creativity, which were restricted by the 
highly centralized planned economic system, and they will 
certainly come up with many innovative ideas. We must warmly 
approach the masses' inventions and creativity and be good at 
employing their experiences to guide them. We must continue to 
wage arduous struggle. Now that the cardinal policy of carrying 
out reforms has been established, the most important job we must 
do is to firmly implement this policy and immerse ourselves in 
hard work. Reform and opening up are a cause that will benefit 
the whole nation, but it is not likely that each and every one 
of us will benefit at the same time. In fact, certain people 
may have to suffer a little. Thus, we must be prepared to do 
hard work and be ready to make some short-term sacrifice for the 
sake of national needs. Because of the socialist market 
economic system, China certainly will certainly become a 
prosperous country and Chinese people certainly will become an 
affluent people; but if Chinese people of various nationalities 
fail to make concerted efforts and to work hard, our grand plan 
cannot be achieved. Whether people are willing to work hard 
lies primarily in whether those in leading positions can set 
good examples. Leading cadres at all levels must be ready to 
work hard mentally and while doing their work, and they must 
live plainly. Leading cadres must go deep into the realities of 
life and immerse themselves among the masses. They must take 
the initiative to solve problems and create a new situation at 
places with many problems. In short, the opportunity for us to 
speed up reform and development is good, and the situation is 
favorable in many ways. As long as we study theory earnestly, 
respect practical experience, maintain close ties with the 
masses, and persevere in doing hard work, we certainly can 
surmount all sorts of difficulties and can accomplish the 
historic mission of building a socialist market economic system. 
  The issues mentioned above are issues that must be attended 
to and studied when we implement the "decision." These issues 
are also important issues which members of people's political 
consultative organs must deal with when they are involved in 
managing government affairs. We must throw ourselves into the 
great cause of building a socialist market economic system, give 
full scope to our strengths, and contribute what we can. 
  Fellow Standing Committee members, 1993 will soon be over. I 
remember I said at a previous meeting that we were fortunate 
that we can come together from various corners of the country. 
Because of our close cooperation during the past year, we have 
promoted mutual understanding and have deepened our friendship. 
This has created a good beginning for members of this CPPCC 
National Committee. During the new year, we must rally even 
closer around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as the core, work with one heart and one mind, and continue to 
work hard to create a new situation for people's political 
consultative organs! 
  Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you a happy 
new year, good health, and happiness for all your families!

Congratulatory Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Theoretical 
Study Class for Leading Cadres of the Democratic Parties and the 
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Nonparty 
Figures" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- An opening ceremony of a 
theoretical study class for leading cadres of the democratic 
parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce 
(ACFIC), as well as figures without party affiliation, was held 
in Beijing today. This session of the theoretical study class 
will mainly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. More than 40 leading cadres from the democratic 
parties' central committees, vice chairmen of the ACFIC, and 
nonparty figures who hold leading positions in various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government, as well as leading nonparty figures from 
various ministries, commissions, and bureaus directly under the 
State Council, participated in the study class. 
  Hu Jintao, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and also a member 
of the CPC Secretariat and president of the Central Party 
School, extended his warm congratulations on the opening of the 
study class. He said: The theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
constitutes contemporary Marxism in China. It is also the 
spiritual pillar and scientific guidance that guide us on our 
continuing triumphant march forward and the theoretical 
foundation of the CPC basic line in the new period. Only if we 
have a deep understanding and a good command of the theory can 
we comprehensively and correctly understand and implement the 
party's basic line, and only by constantly consolidating the 
theoretical firmness can we constantly heighten our 
consciousness toward implementing the basic line. 
  Hu Jintao said: The nineties is an important historical 
period for our national development and national rejuvenation. 
Currently, the overall situation in our country is good, being 
characterized by economic development, political stability, 
national unity, and social progress. The international 
situation is also relatively favorable for us to further deepen 
the reform, open wider to the outside world, and concentrate our 
efforts to further improve our economy. We are facing a rare 
historic opportunity for reform and development. The key to 
deepening reform lies in seizing opportunities to accelerate the 
reform. The "Decisions on Some Issues Concerning the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
symbolizes the fact that our economic restructuring has embarked 
upon a new stage that combines pushing forward as a whole with 
making breakthroughs in key areas. The current year will 
witness our making the biggest strides in reform since it was 
introduced over a decade ago. It may also be considered an 
extremely crucial year in the process of China's reform and 
development; and the task is extremely arduous and heavy. In 
the course of our moving forward, we will inevitably encounter 
many complicated situations and problems that we have never 
encountered before. Only if we have a good command of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, a 
grasp of the essence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth 
from facts, as well as a grasp of the scientific attitudes and 
creative spirit as demonstrated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in his 
application of the Marxist stand, concept, and method to study 
new situations and to solve new problems, will we be able to 
unify our thought, have a correct grasp of the relationship 
between stability, reform, and development; be able to deal 
properly with the various social conflicts, to prevent 
one-sidedness and to avoid making blunders; and only then can we 
enhance our ability and level for taking control of the overall 
situation and the socialist market economy, as well as can we 
guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening to the outside 
world, and the modernization drive. 
  Hu Jintao said: The multiparty cooperation under the 
leadership of the CPC and political consultation system is our 
country's basic political system; it represents one of the 
principal bases of socialist democracy and constitutes an 
important component of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
This political system which is created and developed in light 
of China's national situation, after having been subjected to 
trials in all types of weather, has manifested its tremendous 
vitality. Practice has proved that the various democratic 
parties participating in political affairs in sincere 
cooperation with the CPC are close comrades in arms of the CPC 
who have gone through thick and thin together in the same boat 
over a long period of time. They constitute a formidable force 
in our patriotic united front; it is also an important force in 
safeguarding stability and unity in our country, in promoting 
socialist modernization, and in pushing forward the great 
undertaking of reunification of the motherland in accordance 
with the principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, 
two systems." 
  He said: A common undertaking, a common goal, and a common 
task call for a common ideological foundation. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is not only a crystallization of the collective 
wisdom of the CPC but also is a crystallization of the 
collective wisdom of the people of all nationalities in our 
country, including those from the various democratic parties, 
the ACFIC, and figures without party affiliation. It 
constitutes not only the most valuable spiritual wealth of the 
CPC, but also the most valuable spiritual wealth of the people 
of all nationalities in China, including members of the various 
democratic parties and the ACFIC and nonparty figures. It 
represents a source of strength for stimulating not only the 
unremitting struggle of the CPC but also the avowed struggle of 
the people of all nationalities in the country, including 
members of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC and 
nonparty figures. In the new historical period, only if we 
study well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and form a consensus and enhance 
unity on the basis of a new ideology can we better uphold and 
perfect the multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the 
CPC and the political consultation system, fortify and expand 
the patriotic united front, and unswervingly implement the basic 
principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, showing 
utter devotion to each other, and the sharing of weal and woe" 
on a common political foundation, as well as fully bring into 
play and enhance the democratic party's role in political 
consultation and democratic supervision, thereby pushing forward 
the building of a socialist democracy. 
  Hu Jintao said: In the main, this study class will study 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and 
at the same time it will closely combine the study of the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with the 
study and appreciation of the "decisions" made by the Third 
Plenary of the 14th CPC Central Committee. I suggest that in 
the course of your study, all of you should earnestly study the 
original work, strive to grasp its spiritual essence, carry 
forward the fine style of correlating theory with practice, and 
put into practice what you have learned, as well as strive to 
earnestly organize study, integrating independent thinking with 
drawing on collective wisdom and absorbing all useful ideas, and 
freely speak out and express your own views, consult with one 
another on an equal footing, and learn from each other's strong 
points to make up one's deficiencies, thereby raising the 
overall standard of study and discussions. 
  Lei Jieqiong, chairperson of the China Association for 
Promoting Democracy, spoke on behalf of the central committees 
of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC. She said: 
Conducting this theoretical study class for the leading cadres 
of the democratic parties, the ACFIC, and nonparty figures 
constitutes an important measure for enhancing the 
self-improvement of the democratic parties and is of great 
significance to giving impetus to members of the various 
democratic parties and the ACFIC, as well as nonparty figures, 
to further study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to 
strengthening the ideological and theoretical building among the 
democratic parties and the ACFIC. It will also have a 
far-reaching impact on efforts to meet the needs of the current 
situation and the needs of the united front work, as well as on 
efforts to further uphold and perfect the multiparty cooperation 
under the leadership of the CPC and the political consultation 
system. She said that through the present study, participants 
will certainly further improve their theoretical standards and 
leadership ability and do a better job. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of 
the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, 
also spoke at the opening ceremony. 
  Also present at the opening ceremony of the study class 
were: 
Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the China Democratic League Central 
Committee; nonparty figure Cheng Siyuan; Lu Jiaxi, chairman of 
the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Central 
Committee; Li Peiyao, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of 
the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee; Wu Jieping, chairman 
of the Jiusan (3 September) Society Central Committee; Cai 
Zimin, chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government Central 
Committee; Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the China 
Democratic National Construction Central Committee; Yang Jike, 
executive vice chairman of the China Zhi Gong Dang (Party for 
the Public Interest) Central Committee; Jing Shuping, vice 
chairman of the ACFIC; as well as leading comrades including 
Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Wang Jialiu, Jiang Minkuan, Liu 
Yandong, and Liu Shengyu from the Organization Department, the 
Propaganda Department, the United Front Work Department, and the 
Party School of the CPC Central Committee.

<F P=106> ["Abridged" version of interview with Gong Yuzhi, vice </F>
chairman of the Study Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, by Bian Yanjun (6708 1750 
6511), Zhang Suhua (1728 4790 5478), and Wu Xiaomei (0702 2556 
2734): "Two Revolutions, Two Leaps, and Two Major Theoretical 
Achievements" -- first paragraph is editor's note; original 
published in MAO ZEDONG SIXIANG YANJIU] 
  [Text] The following is a conversation between Gong Yuzhi 
and the interviewers; it views the angle of historical 
continuity the relationship between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. This is a topic that greatly fascinates the 
people. This record of the interview certainly can help the 
people ponder the issue deeply. 
  [Question] Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, our party's second-generation leading 
collective, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, has 
explored diligently the road of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and has formed a set of new theories. What is 
the relationship between this set of new theories and those 
established by the first-generation leading collective, which 
was represented by Comrade Mao Zedong? Please tell us something 
about this from your research and experience. 
  [Gong Yuzhi] In the course of compiling the book The 
CPC's 70 Years, Comrade Hu Sheng has held discussions with 
us, and these discussions have led to the proposal of an idea, 
which is that concerning the division of the historical periods 
of the party, the historic status of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee should receive greater 
emphasis. That is to say, if we stand higher and look further 
ahead, we may consider dividing the party's history into three 
major periods, and the textbook on party history into three 
major chapters. The first chapter is about democratic 
revolution, and explains how the party led the people to begin 
the grand and vigorous revolutionary struggle -- which 
experienced two major twists, but had a relatively smooth 
development following the Zunyi meeting -- and eventually ended 
with a great victory, which was the founding of the PRC. The 
second chapter is the opening chapter on socialism, and 
discusses how the party led the people after the nation's 
founding to embark upon the road of socialism, to make important 
achievements in socialist construction, and to go through two 
major twists in the middle. It ends with another victory: The 
crushing of the "gang of four" and halting of the Great Cultural 
Revolution. The third chapter is the new chapter on socialism, 
which began from the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee. It is still difficult to say when it will 
end. 
  At present, I feel that we may further consider using the 
viewpoint of "the second revolution" to observe the historic 
status of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee. Comrade Xiaoping said many times: "The reform is 
China's second revolution." It was in 1985 that he directly 
raised this proposition, but judged from his way of thinking, we 
may trace it back to an even earlier time. Comrade Xiaoping's 
speech -- "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts, and Unite 
to Look Forward" -- was, in fact, a report on the main theme of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. It 
said: "Realizing the four modernizations is a profound and great 
revolution." On the eve of the plenary session, he addressed 
the ninth meeting of trade union representatives, saying: "This 
is a great revolution to completely change the economically and 
technologically backward situation of our country, and to 
further consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Since this 
revolution has to change greatly the currently backward 
productive forces, it naturally must change in many ways the 
production relations, the superstructure, the management style 
in industrial and agricultural enterprises, and the manner in 
which the state manages them, so as to make them adapt to the 
needs of a large modernized economy." Here we can see that both 
before and after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping and the Central Committee of 
our party already had raised the issues of the new revolution 
and of China's second revolution from the angle of uniting 
modernization with reform. The Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee was the starting point for China's 
second revolution. 
  Thus, we can stand on a higher and borader plain to sum up 
the 71-year history of our party: Two generations of mature 
central leading collectives led two great revolutions and 
achieved two historic leaps in integrating Marxism with China's 
practice. The mature first-generation central leading 
collective, with Mao Zedong as the core, led us to overthrow the 
three big mountains, found the PRC, establish the basic system 
of socialism, and accomplish the first revolution of China. In 
the process, it accomplished the first historic leap in 
integrating Marxism with China's practice. The theoretical 
achievement in this leap was Mao Zedong Thought. The mature 
second-generation central leading collective, with Deng Xiaoping 
as the core, led us to begin the second revolution of China, 
that is, to carry out profound reform for the achievement of 
modernization, and in the process, it has begun to realize the 
second historic leap in integrating Marxism with China's 
practice. The theoretical achievement in this leap is Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  The assessment given by the report to the 13th party 
congress is: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, our party has proposed a series of scientific 
theoretical viewpoints "that constitute an outline of the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." The 
assessment that the "outline" has been constituted carries a lot 
of weight and a sense of propriety. Comrade Xiaoping's southern 
tour speech has further used a new viewpoint for a new 
elaboration so as to upgrade the theory to a new level. 
  [Question] There are two generations of leaders, two 
revolutions, two leaps, and two theoretical achievements. Do 
they illustrate the relationship between Mao Zedong Thought and 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, judged from the main process of CPC history? 
  [Gong] It is necessary to further analyze the relationship 
between the theories and practices of the second-generation 
central leading collective with Deng Xiaoping as the core, on 
the one hand, and the theories and practice of the 
first-generation central leading collective with Mao Zedong as 
the core, on the other. What is the relationship? I want to 
stress three conditions, which are correction, inheritance, and 
development. It will not work if we discuss only one condition, 
nor will it work if we discuss just two conditions; we have to 
talk about all three. The first condition is correction, which 
means correction of the theoretical and practical mistakes Mao 
Zedong made in his later years. 
  [Question] You have published your work entitled "Under the 
Banner of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," in which you 
first talked about inheritance when talking about this 
relationship. 
  [Gong] That is also a way to write things. The purpose of 
this method is to stress the continuity and the inherited nature 
of the undertakings led by our party. Speaking from the actual 
process of historical turning points, the first thing is 
certainly correction of the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his 
later years because there is a basic historical fact here: The 
10 years of internal turmoil during the Cultural Revolution 
severely harmed the people in our country, and brought the party 
and the country to a difficult and dangerous situation. 
Escaping the mistake of the Cultural Revolution is the 
precondition for entering the new period. The crushing of the 
"gang of four" began a turning point in history. In the first 
two years, however, the process of this historical turning point 
met with some difficulties. The crucial problem at that time 
was whether we had the courage, resolution, and ability to face 
directly the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years, and 
to handle properly the issue of upholding the scientific system 
of Mao Zedong Thought on the one hand, while one the other hand, 
correcting the mistakes he made during his later years. Why was 
there "two whateverism" and "hesitant progress?" In the final 
analysis, it was because the central leaders did not have the 
political and theoretical courage to solve the problem, and they 
lacked the resolution and ability to steer the helm of history 
so as to change direction. 
  To the central leaders at that time, if these major mistakes 
were pointed out and corrected, Mao Zedong's banner would be 
lost, and knife would be lost. That is to say, they set up a 
simplistic opposition between correcting the mistakes and 
hoisting the banner -- in order to hoist the banner one cannot 
correct the mistakes; to correct the mistakes would mean losing 
the banner. 
  Under these conditions, Comrade Xiaoping showed his courage, 
resolution, and ability as a proletarian revolutionary. Comrade 
Xiaoping dared to point out clearly the mistakes made by Mao 
Zedong in his later years, and to correct them resolutely. He 
also stressed that only by correcting these mistakes can we 
truly raise the banner of the scientific system of Mao Zedong 
Thought. Of course, when we talk about the mistakes, we have to 
look at the situation insofar as to when and to what extent we 
should discuss them. When Deng began, he said Mao Zedong 
Thought was a scientific system and that quoting fragmentary 
sayings out of context could in no way represent this system of 
thought. Later, he said that the theory and practice of the 
Cultural Revolution were basically wrong, and when he said this, 
it was not simply a problem of quotations. Here we see a process 
of understanding, as well as the art of guidance. Mao Zedong 
made great historical contributions to the party, to China's 
revolution, and to the founding and development of the PRC. His 
great creation was the integration of Marxism with China's 
practice; his problem was that he started the Cultural 
Revolution in his later years, and deviated from the correct 
line of integrating Marxism with China's practice, a line which 
he had established himself. Therefore, the new period must 
begin with correcting the Cultural Revolution mistake, and with 
"sorting out the chaos." Comrade Xiaoping's definition of 
"sorting out the chaos and bringing things back onto right 
track" was "correcting the chaos caused by the destructive Lin 
Biao and the `gang of four,' criticizing the mistakes made by 
Comrade Mao Zedong in his later years, and returning to the 
correct track of Mao Zedong Thought." 
  The second condition is inheritance. "Bringing things back 
onto the right track" is inheritance. To sort out chaos and 
correct mistakes is not to completely overthrow the past, for we 
never can deny the things that have been proved correct through 
practice. Shortly after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping proposed the four 
cardinal principles our party must uphold, the fourth of which 
is "upholding Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong 
Thought -- which has been proven as a scientific principle 
through the practice of revolution in China, and which includes 
all the positive fruit of Mao Zedong's thinking when he pondered 
China's own way of building socialism -- must be inherited and 
developed today. Without this relationship of inheritance, 
history is negated and severed, and we will lose our basic 
foothold and the direction in which we advance. 
  [Question] We have read some materials stating that at the 
time there was a trend of thought on completely negating Mao 
Zedong, but Comrade Huang Kecheng came out to make a speech and 
publish an article. Comrade Xiaoping presided over the work of 
drafting the "Decision on Several Historical Problems of the 
Party Since the Founding of the Nation," and he demanded an 
overall assessment of Mao Zedong, and a special chapter on "the 
historic status of Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought" 
within the historic decision. Was the trend of thought on 
negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought that serious at the 
time? 
  [Gong] It has to be divided into several levels and 
domains. One kind was the comments from overseas, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, and society, and these comments were very strong, that 
is, they completely negated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. 
To this extent, they completely negated the CPC. The other 
kind was certain comments within the party, and even though some 
of these comments were rather extreme and some were rather 
erroneous, they were different in nature from the first kind. 
However, it is not advisable to look at historical questions 
with an agitated and absolutist attitude and without an 
analytical attitude. In the course of presiding over the work 
to draft the historic decision, Comrade Xiaoping spoke 
frequently, criticizing and refuting certain viewpoints; he was 
getting at something. In addition, some people specializing in 
theoretical work suggested that the concept of Mao Zedong 
Thought should no longer be used; they said that if Mao Zedong's 
name is used to name a certain system of thought, then Mao 
Zedong's "leftist" mistakes should be included as well. They 
held that it would be unjustifiable to include only the correct 
things while excluding the incorrect things. I disagree with 
this viewpoint. I think that since our party has used the 
concept of Mao Zedong Thought for so many years, if the concept 
were to be written off at a single stoke, this would not be 
beneficial politically, nor would it conform to history, and not 
conforming to history is not conforming to a scientific 
attitude. The fact of history is: The integration of Marxism 
with the practice of revolution in China has resulted in a 
scientific theoretical achievement. Can we deny this fact? As 
for how this theoretical achievement should be named, this is a 
secondary problem. Since in the past we have used Mao Zedong 
Thought to refer to this theoretical achievement, and Mao Zedong 
has indeed made the greatest contribution to the creation of 
this theoretical achievement, we have no need or reason now to 
cancel the term. What we should do now is to use practice to 
examine many of the viewpoints that were raised in the past, to 
see which have been proven correct through practice and which 
viewpoints practice has proved erroneous. In addition, we 
should use the name Mao Zedong Thought to refer to the 
scientific theoretical achievement of the central leading 
collective represented mainly by Mao Zedong, and should 
distinguish it from the mistakes made by Mao Zedong during his 
later years. 
  The mistakes made by Mao Zedong during his later years must 
be negated, but Mao Zedong's great historical merits and the 
scientific theoretical achievement of Mao Zedong Thought never 
can be negated. We must adopt a scientific and analytical 
attitude when dealing with the history of the party and of the 
people's revolution. We must not write off everything at one 
stoke, nor must we completely negate its basic achievement when 
we have to correct mistakes arising from the historical process. 
Of course, neither can we lack the boldness and resolution to 
correct these mistakes while safeguarding the basic achievement. 
We must see clearly the following fact: Mao Zedong is closely 
linked to the history of the CPC and of the Chinese people's 
revolution. Completely negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong 
Thought means completely negating the history of the CPC and of 
the Chinese people's revolution. 
  In 1983, when the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
(1975-83) were published, I wrote an article for RENMIN 
RIBAO entitled "An Important Document of China's Marxism," in 
which I wrote: "Concerning the problem of how to deal with the 
mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong during his later years, as 
well as with Mao Zedong Thought, our party's political courage 
and leading ability have undergone the sternest test." Under 
conditions of the Mao Zedong cult reaching its zenith through 
the Cultural Revolution -- and that at that time the central 
leaders were still adhering to the two "whatevers," -- Comrade 
Xiaoping courageously came out and said: The two "whatevers" 
were not in accordance with Marxism; Mao Zedong made mistakes 
during his later years and those mistakes were serious. This 
demonstrated the great political courage of a Marxist. In the 
course of correcting this kind of mistake, there emerged a trend 
of thought that doubted and negated the historical status of Mao 
Zedong, as well as Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Xiaoping came 
out again to "prevail over all dissenting views," demanding that 
the party explicitly affirm the most basic achievement of 
China's revolution, safeguard Mao Zedong's historical status, 
and uphold and develop Mao Zedong Thought. The political 
courage in these two areas surfaced in an environment in which a 
great historical turning point was taking place. The political 
courage of Comrade Xiaoping in these two areas enabled our party 
to pass this great historical turning point in a relatively 
smooth, steady, and healthy manner. Without the first 
condition, there would have been no historical turning point, 
and we might still be dragging our feet along the original road. 
Without the second condition, the turning point might not have 
been good and might have caused chaos, and those things that 
completely deviated from the revolutionary track would have run 
rampant. These two areas faced a relatively strong kind of 
trend in which steering the helm of history required great 
political and theoretical courage, as well as the resolution and 
boldness of a revolutionary. 
  [Question] This is the charisma of a great man, for no 
ordinary man could have done it. 
  [Gong] Also he has to give reasons: Charisma, plus 
authoritativeness, plus reasons; and reasons mean theory. 
Comrade Xiaoping was situated in an influential position. In 
addition, he had such resolution and charisma, and he also gave 
reasons, which he discussed with the whole party, so as to 
concentrate the wisdom of the whole party. He not only broke 
the taboo of the two "whatevers" and corrected the mistakes made 
by Mao Zedong in his later years, but also gave a scientific 
explanation of Mao Zedong Thought, made a scientific judgment of 
the right and wrong things in history, and gave a scientific 
plan for the road to be followed in the future. That was the 
historical background against which the Sixth Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee made the "Decision on Several 
Historical Problems of the Party Since the Founding of the 
Nation." 
  Why did a historic decision have to be made at that time? 
Because there was a need for a conclusion on the right and 
wrong things in the history of the Cultural Revolution. It was 
not an easy thing to judge and determine that the Cultural 
Revolution was basically a mistake, and to foster such a 
consensus within the party. The two "whatevers," first and 
mainly, involved three things: First, the Tiananmen incident; 
second, the "campaign to criticize Deng and strike back at the 
right-deviationist trend of overthrowing verdicts"; and third, 
the Cultural Revolution. These three things could not be shaken 
because they were decided by Chairman Mao. The Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee criticized the two 
"whatevers" and settled the first two things, but the third -- 
whether the Cultural Revolution was right or wrong -- was left 
unsolved. Later, the "historic decision" solved the third 
thing, clearly pointing out the basic mistake in the practice 
and theory of the Cultural Revolution, and analyzing the cause 
and development of the "leftist" mistake in the Cultural 
Revolution. Thus, the basic problems could be regarded as 
having been solved, and the problems that remained unsolved were 
less important ones, such as the criticism of the movie "The 
Biography of Wu Xun," which could be settled through other means 
and methods. 
  Therefore, the "historic decision" was first, to "sort out 
the chaos," which was to clearly determine and completely 
correct the mistakes in Cultural Revolution; second, to "bring 
things back onto the right track," which meant, while correcting 
the mistakes, to affirm the most basic practical and theoretical 
achievements in China's revolution and socialist development, to 
affirm the historical status of Mao Zedong, and to affirm the 
scientific principle of Mao Zedong Thought. After adopting the 
"historic decision," the CPC Central Committee announced: The 
party's duty -- to sort out chaos and bring things back onto the 
right track in the area of guiding thought -- basically had been 
accomplished. 
  [Question] Judging from the development of the party's 
undertakings in the new period, it seems that these two 
conditions alone are not sufficient. 
  [Gong] These two conditions alone -- sorting out chaos and 
bringing things back onto the right track -- still remained 
within Mao Zedong's theoretical and practical domain, and were 
nothing more than correcting the incorrect things through 
practice and examination, and upholding the correct things. New 
innovations have to be made in the new period. 
  Among correction, inheritance, and development, the 
combination of the first two means sorting out chaos and 
bringing things back onto the right track, and the combination 
of the last two means inheriting from the past and opening up a 
new situation. Overall reform means opening up a new situation, 
exploration, innovation, and development. The new period has 
met with many new problems. So-called new problems mean new 
conditions which we did not come cross in the time of Mao 
Zedong, as well as many problems arising from new needs, or 
problems we encountered in the time of Mao Zedong but we did not 
solve properly. From domestic to foreign policies, the reform 
and opening up have met with many new problems, which require 
innovative solutions from us. Regarding the problems of 
exploration and innovation, these cannot be solved simply by 
distinguishing the right things from the wrong things in Mao 
Zedong's theoretical and practical domains. To correctly 
understand the new problems arising from the new situation and 
to solve them innovatively, it is necessary to enable Mao Zedong 
Thought to have a new development. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, our party has indeed had a new development in the 
area of theory. It is very important to honestly understand and 
admit this point. It is a correction of the mistakes made by 
Mao Zedong in his later years on the one hand, and on the other, 
an inheritance from the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. 
At the same time, it is a new development in solving the new 
problems of the new period in which we face a new situation. 
  [Question] That means a new theoretical framework has been 
formed. 
  [Gong] Perhaps we may say that it has begun to take shape. 
As to the concept and language that should be used to sum it 
up, that is a decision for the central leadership. The 13th 
party congress used the wording "the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics." Since Comrade Xiaoping 
made his southern tour speech, I have noticed that some central 
documents have used the wording "the theory and line of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics advocated by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping," and the wording "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics." All these 
have further emphasized Comrade Xiaoping's status in 
establishing the theory, as well as the main content of 
"building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the inheritance and development of Mao Zedong 
Thought under new historical conditions. Why must we use a 
single concept to sum it up? Precisely because it has not 
simply added several trifles on the foundation of the 
theoretical achievement already secured by Comrade Mao Zedong, 
but has made a relatively great advance, and has involved a 
series of searches, new explorations, and new creations 
beginning to form a set of new theories, and so there has to be 
a new summation. 
  I feel that on the one hand, there indeed has to be a new 
summation because a new theory has begun to take shape. On the 
other, just as proposing Mao Zedong Thought as a new concept at 
the seventh party congress did not mean abandoning 
Marxism-Leninism, advocating Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics at this time does not 
mean abandoning Mao Zedong Thought. From Mao Zedong's theory 
and practice, the root of and the preparation for the new theory 
can be found, and there is a linking spirit, which illustrates 
the relationship between Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and Mao Zedong Thought: 
Inheritance and development. 
  [Question] You have just mentioned the linking spirit. Does 
this mean that between Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping there exist 
some common features? 
  [Gong] I think it would be very meaningful to carry out a 
comparative study of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. For example, 
their greatest point in common is that they stressed "seeking 
truth from facts." When Comrade Xiaoping talked about Mao 
Zedong Thought, what he talked most was seeking truth from 
facts. He thought that this was the quintessence of Mao Zedong 
Thought. He said himself: I am one in the clique that seeks 
truth from facts. In his southern tour speech he stressed again: 
"Seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of Marxism. This 
must be advocated in stead of book worship. We do not rely on 
book worship to make our reform and opening up a success; we 
rely on practice and seeking truth from facts." I adhere to 
"one rule, which is that I believe Mao Zedong's words on seeking 
truth from facts." Some people are not comfortable with this 
advocacy; they think that there are several volumes of the works 
of Mao Zedong on a great variety of topics -- such as political 
theory, military theory, and cultural thoughts -- so how can we 
mention just the four characters "seeking truth from facts?" In 
fact, the ultimate reason why Mao Zedong Thought could have so 
many creations that suited China's conditions in the political, 
military, and cultural areas was because he could seek truth 
from facts and integrate Marxism with China's practice, and not 
just copy from books or foreign experience. When Comrade 
Xiaoping stressed that seeking truth from facts was the 
quintessence of Mao Zedong Thought and of Marxism, he wanted us 
to understand correctly and grasp the position, viewpoint, and 
method of Mao Zedong Thought, and to create new theories for 
ourselves in response to the new situation. 
  The root of our socialist ideology is certainly the 
scientific socialism of Marx. They derived many concrete 
conclusions in those years, but from then to now, some 100 years 
have elapsed, and the situation has changed tremendously. Just 
as Comrade Xiaoping has said, we cannot ask Marx to provide 
concrete conclusions for us to solve the problems arising 100 or 
1,000 years after his death. By the same token, Lenin cannot 
take responsibility for things that happen 50 or 100 years after 
his passing. The real Marxist- Leninists must inherit and 
develop Marxism-Leninism according to their understanding of the 
current situation. This remark was contained in his May 1989 
speech. If the descendants confine themselves to the framework 
of concrete conclusions given by their predecessors, they will 
bind their own minds, feet, and hands. When Mao Zedong 
criticized dogmatism in the past, he said that we should not 
copy concrete conclusions, but grasp the basic position, 
viewpoint, and method, and use them to face China's reality and 
solve new problems. We also must study and learn from the 
scientific results of our predecessors, for we cannot do without 
knowledge. In the final analysis, however, we must apply those 
results to today's objective reality, raise new questions, and 
solve new problems. Therefore the ideological line of seeking 
truth from facts remains the most important thing. 
  Regarding the concrete conclusions on socialism, one is the 
model provided by the Soviet Union, the other is the idea Mao 
Zedong had in his later years. Comrade Xiaoping did not copy 
from these, but grasped the spirit of seeking truth from facts, 
and brought all the past concrete conclusions on socialism, for 
examination according to the practice and development of today. 
By so doing he could make innovations, and have the great 
political and theoretical courage to break through the 
ideological trammels so as to open up a new situation of 
socialist reform, opening up, and modernization in China. 
  For example, Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong, as strategists, 
have a very big point in common: In China's democratic 
revolution, one of the very important rules of Mao Zedong's 
strategic thinking was to go to the rural areas to establish 
revolutionary bases, and follow the road of surrounding cities, 
village by village. It was Mao Zedong who used and developed 
Marxism in an innovative way, found a breakthrough point in the 
rural areas where the rule of China's reactionary forces was 
weaker, and opened up the road on which China's proletariat and 
peasants united as allies so as to increase their strength. 
This was the revolutionary road with Chinese characteristics. 
The problem of rural areas and peasants has always occupied a 
central position in China's revolution. Today, Comrade Xiaoping 
is leading China to reform, and in his strategic thinking too, 
rural areas and peasants have always occupied a very important 
position in China's reform. Therefore, since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's reform has 
started from the rural areas, and has scored results. In my 
opinion, in China's revolutionary strategy and reform strategy, 
if the point of rural areas and peasants is grasped, China's 
characteristics are grasped. Those who do not understand 
China's conditions cannot understand this basic strategic point. 
Both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping thoroughly understood China's 
conditions and Chinese history, and both of them have 
flesh-and-blood connections to rural areas, where the majority 
of the Chinese population is to be found, so they knew the 
status of peasants in China, and they knew how to grasp this 
basic point when solving China's problems. 
  China's unbalanced revolutionary development is a problem we 
may cite as another example. Mao Zedong once expounded on this 
issue profoundly when he criticized "left-deviationist" 
dogmatism. He criticized the "left-deviationists" as having an 
acute revolutionary disease, meaning that they were anxious to 
realize a nationwide revolutionary peak, and they failed to see 
that in a big country such as China, the development of the 
revolution will be unbalanced in different periods and in 
different places, and this kind of imbalance originates from 
China's unbalanced political and economic development. Now we 
are carrying out reform, opening up, and modernization 
construction, and Comrade Xiaoping also has raised the issue of 
the unbalanced development of construction in China. It also 
includes two areas: First, the imbalance of development in 
different periods; for example, the imbalance of economic growth 
rates in different years belongs to this area. Second, the 
imbalance of different regions; for example, allowing some 
regions, enterprises, and people to become rich first, and the 
gradual advancement of opening up from the coastal regions to 
the interior, belong to this area. Speaking from strategic 
thinking, this is to grasp the unbalanced development of China, 
including political, economic, educational, cultural, and 
geographical imbalances, and proceeding from this basic point, 
to seek the most effective development method on the foundation 
of the unbalanced development, to stimulate development through 
the unbalanced development, and to realize comparatively 
balanced development in the future. 
  To conclude, it is very meaningful to carry out a 
comparative 
study of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Here we see common 
things, things that are linked, and things that are inherited 
from and surpass the predecessors. When descendants inherit 
things left behind by predecessors, and when they sum up the 
experiences and lessons of their predecessors, they should be 
able to see more clearly and walk more vigorously than their 
predecessors.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor] </F>
  [Text] China's social stability is being threatened by an 
influx of migrants, potential spiralling price rises and other 
social problems following the rush for sweeping reforms this 
year, an official Chinese government report says. 
  The widening income gap between the rich and the poor, 
increasing economic crimes, official corruption, labour disputes 
and receding national unity among ethnic minorities are also 
listed as major threats in the report. 
  Ordered by the State Council, China's cabinet, the report 
tries to identify potential social problems that might crop up 
this year when the country is set to fully embrace a 
quasi-capitalistic market economy. The move underlined the 
Chinese leadership's serious concerns over possible social 
unrest and their caution over the on- going reforms. 
  Senior leaders, including Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin 
and Premier Li Peng recently talked of "keeping a balance among 
economic growth, reforms and social stability". 
  Chinese sources yesterday said the internal report, compiled 
by a team made up of experts from the State Council's Research 
Office, the Economic Forecasting Centre, and economists and 
sociologists from research institutes, also suggested the 
government should take the "necessary measures" to minimise the 
"unsettling factors" from further development. The report 
predicts that with a comparatively tight money supply and a 
reduction in capital investment this year, the major coastal 
cities' labour markets will not be able to accommodate the 
increasing pressure of migrant job-seekers. It also says the 
reforms are likely to force more urban employees out of work. 
  Inflation is expected to continue to rise, while prices of 
staple foods, major consumer products and construction materials 
will pick up, following the government's move to free more 
prices from central control. The report adds that reforms 
should be introduced only as long as consumers can bear the 
inevitable inflation. 
  In an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency 
published on Sunday, Li said too rapid strides in price reform 
would cause instability. 
  The government reimposed controls on the price of grain and 
other staple foods in many large cities in late December, after 
watching prices soar 30 to 40 percent in a month. Government 
officials said the sudden rise was partly due to panic buying in 
anticipation of even higher prices in 1994 and partly because of 
farmers hoarding their grain for the same purpose. 
  The report also warns that the income gap between the 
richest 
and the poorest in China has widened to an alarming scale. It 
said the income gap in China was at a ratio of between 1:15 to 
1:20, while in developed nations it was about 1:10. The gap is 
likely to become wider following the massive privatisation of 
state assets. The gap between the rich coastal regions and the 
impoverished western hinterland will increase, although the 
latter is developing and the living standards of the people 
there are rising, the report says. 
  However, the report says China can overcome these problems 
if 
the government takes the "appropriate measures" and is cautious 
in implementing its reforms.

<F P=106> ["People's Forum" by Li Demin (2621 1795 3046): "Gambling </F>
Is Fiercer Than Tigers"] 
  [Text] "The winners indulge in eating and drinking and go 
whoring, and the losers end up stealing, picking pockets, and 
mugging." That is an assessment of gambling by the common 
people. Those who gamble, whether they win or lose, will 
certainly come to no good end. 
  It is not now that the CPC and the people's government are 
opposed to gambling. In the past thousands of years, in this 
ancient country of civilization of ours, gambling has always 
been denounced and banned and subjected to punishment. Gambling 
money, gambling paraphernalia, stakes, gamblers, and inveterate 
gamblers have never been commendatory terms. As far back as in 
the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, cock 
fighting, horse racing, and other similar gambling conduct were 
denounced as "evil ways"; in the Tang Dynasty, gamblers were 
subjected to bludgeoning and whipping; and in the Song Dynasty, 
they were even beheaded. It was decreed in the early Song 
Dynasty: "Those gambling in the streets will be beheaded and 
those neighbors who shield, harbor, or fail to report them will 
be treated in the same way." Although the "Law of the Qing 
Dynasty" gave the Man people certain privileges, the penalty 
meted out to those guilty of gambling was even harsher than to 
the Han people. In the West, there as "legitimate gambling" or 
"nonprofit institutional gambling," such as casino gambling, 
horse racing, and lotteries. However, after repeated 
investigation and studies, it can only be regarded as "something 
with a deep-rooted dual nature in terms of ethics and philosophy 
and many outstanding social issues." In modern or ancient 
times, in China or elsewhere, decent people do not gamble and or 
are opposed to gambling. 
  However, dying embers glow again and the dregs of society 
have come to the surface. In socialist China, gambling, which 
is a social plague, has spread again in recent years. It 
involves a fairly wide spectrum of people, old, young, men, and 
women in both rural and urban areas. The modes of gambling have 
also diversified, from the indigenous to the foreign ones. What 
merits special attention is that criminal syndicates with 
gambling as their profession have taken shape in some 
localities. The number of gamblers has risen, the stakes become 
bigger, and cases of gambling- related theft, corruption, 
bribery, mugging, and homicide have increased. Gambling, as an 
ugly phenomenon, has seriously polluted society and poisoned the 
people. 
  It is a great pity that some people have wittingly or 
unwittingly defended gambling, saying that it is an "exciting 
recreational activity," "kindling the spirit of competition and 
fighting to win," and is a psychological experience of 
"expectation," "confrontation," and "trusting to luck." Others 
regard gambling and pornography as "tourist resources" like 
sunlight, beaches, songs, dances, and shopping. All this is 
preposterous. Gambling is gambling. It is harmful in the same 
way as drug-taking, prostitution, and going whoring. How many 
people have lost their family fortunes, broken up their 
families, and brought disgrace and ruin upon themselves by the 
144 mahjong pieces and 54 poker cards. These kinds of tragedy 
have been enacted one after another. To make a lot of money, 
some people in the Xinhui Qiaoqu Economic Development Company, 
Guangdong Province, recklessly took a gamble on over 10 million 
yuan of public money in Macao; they lost and suffered stern 
punishments according to state law. To be able to play mahjong 
free from care, a female worker in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 
unscrupulously drowned her eight-year-old daughter. 
  Gambling is fiercer than tigers. Failure to wipe out this 
scourge will bring calamity to the country and the people. 
Gambling is not recreation. Those wanting to have amusements 
should not gamble because they are entirely different. Now that 
New Year's Day and the Spring Festival are coming, it is good 
for people to come together and have fun, but on no account 
should they gamble and turn a good thing into a bad one.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Seidlitz on interview with State Councillor </F>
Song Jian, chairman of the Science and Technology Commission, in 
Beijing on 4 January: "Beijing Set To Outperform Japan and 
South Korea in the Sphere of Research Before Long"] 
  [Text] The technology transfer to the PRC is taking place 
more rapidly than it did in the past to Japan, South Korea, or 
the other "tiger" nations. "No other country received so much 
high-tech in such a short period of time, and no other country 
is spending so much on the modernization of its industry and its 
agricultural sector as China," State Councillor Song Jian, 
chairman of the Commission for Science and Technology, has said 
in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. 
  The result of this development is that the PRC will assume 
an 
internationally leading position within a few years in important 
spheres such as biochemistry, the microchip, electronics, and 
computer industry, but also in the agricultural sector, and that 
it might become a challenger to Europe, Japan, and even the 
United States. Song pointed out that China was spending more 
than $100 billion per year on buying technology. In addition, 
in 1993 the country was promised almost the same amount in 
investments from other countries. The process of modernization 
is speeded up through the reform of the entire sphere of the 
economy and technology. Song: "The walls in the universities 
are being brought down just like the Berlin Wall." 
  Chinese institutes and universities have now been advised to 
operate on commercial principles and to broadly take care of 
their own funding. "Almost all research institutes in China are 
now guided by market economy principles. Subsidies have been 
cut by 70 percent. We are encouraging the institutes and 
scientists to set up companies of their own. The 
commercialization and the practical use of research results are 
fully under way," Song said. This restructuring process should 
be concluded no later than 1995. The university district in the 
Beijing suburb of Zhongguan Cun has already become a huge 
shopping center for electronics. The new entrepreneurs and 
shop-owners come straight from the universities. The research 
commission and Beijing University founded numerous risk capital 
funds to lend financial support to professors and students who 
"have put out into the sea of the market economy." 
  By the end of the century China will be able to compete with 
Taiwan and South Korea at international markets with its micro- 
electronics products. China has made offers to Japan for 
cooperation in the sector of microchips and electronics but 
Japanese companies have reacted with "careful modesty." 
Nevertheless, China does not have any difficulties regarding 
the transfer of technology. "We can now shop everywhere in the 
world; there are practically no longer any Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] controls," Song 
said. Still, the United States rejected China's long shopping 
list and is hesitating to cooperate particularly in the sphere 
of space and satellites. "Thus the Americans are harming 
themselves, because we have turned to the Germans, who would 
like to do business with us," Song said. This refers in 
particular to satellite technology. Here, cooperation has been 
initiated with the Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm company. For its 
space program, China needs large solar collectors, altitude 
control systems, and high-tension transistors. China will buy 
these systems in Germany. 
  Regarding the state of development of China's rocket 
technology, Song said that, apart from defensive aspects, China 
was pursuing two objectives with its rocket program. On the one 
hand, it wants to take into space "several dozens" of 
communication and data link satellites with Chinese carrier 
systems. Systems should be launched from other -- 
geographically more convenient -- places in the world, too. One 
was seeking cooperation with Brazil in this connection. China is 
able to carry satellites more cheaply than the Americans and 
Europeans. The costs for one launching operation are only $50- 
60 million. On the other hand, there is also the wish to pursue 
independent space research and send manned rockets into space. 
This is why larger rockets were being built with a higher 
payload. China was not trying to compete with the Americans and 
Russians but was pursuing this program out of "its own interest." 
  "In the sphere of science we already have a leading 
international position in the area of biochemistry, even though 
we are not always able to put our research results to practical 
use. As far as product marketing is concerned, we are still 
ineffective," Song said. He predicted that, in no later than 
three to five years, China will take the lead in the area of 
biotechnology. Tens of thousands of young scientists are 
working in this sector without the restrictions western 
scientists have to struggle with in the sphere of gene 
technology. In the area of computers and software China also 
aspired to a leading international role. The state councillor 
pointed out that a subsidiary of Beijing University had already 
achieved 1 billion renminbi (DM280 million) [German marks] in 
sales and took a leading position for the development of the 
software for China's publishing branch. Publishing houses in 
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were using the software 
developed in Beijing, and countries such as Singapore were 
enticing away Chinese professors and researchers. 
  The state councillor, who used to teach at Harvard, pointed 
to the large number (more than 100,000) of Chinese students in 
the United States, Europe, and Japan. "Our students now enjoy 
full freedom of movement: Those who return can shop at the free 
labor market and leave the country again any time and without 
any restrictions, Song said. 
<H5>  Legal System Still Inadequate </H5>
  Apart from the positive balance in the sphere of research 
and 
science, Song did not hesitate to say what some of the problems 
were. China's legal system was still inadequate. He complained 
that "we have so many new laws but they are not applied." 
Moreover, the sector of state industry was like a millstone 
around the neck of the country's reforms and slowing them down. 
For the first time, Song outlined details about the planned 
management reform in the state concerns. Song announced that 
one was planning to introduce the German system of boards of 
managers and supervisors in major state enterprises. These 
bodies should be able to decide independently of the state and 
carry out mutual controls. "We have studied the German system 
and want to introduce it here." 
  The state councillor spoke about progress in the 
agricultural 
sector. The introduction of new technologies, such as in the 
sphere of poultry farming and cattle breeding, but also in the 
area of fishery have produced spectacular success. "In 1993 the 
weather was not good for Chinese agriculture. Nevertheless, 
production went up and we introduced a number of new products." 
In the next century, China's population would soon rise to 1.5 
billion. "We will have no problem in feeding these masses," 
Song said. China would even become an "important competitor" at 
international markets for horticultural products, fruits, rice, 
sugar, fishery products, and even certain kinds of grains.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese computer 
scientists working with Beijing University Founder Group Corp. 
have developed a completely new color-printing technology, which 
has been hailed by specialists as the "beginning of a color 
printing revolution." 
  At a press conference here today organized by the Press and 
Publication Administration of China, Professor Wang Xuan, 
director of the Computer Institute of Beijing University, said 
that all the technology of the new color printing and publishing 
equipment is stored in a personal computer. 
  "The greatest benefit of the new technology is that Chinese 
printing houses can now do their color printing without buying 
and using the expensive imported electronic color analyzers," 
said Wang, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences. 
  According to Wang, China's printing houses have spent 70 
million U.S. dollars importing some 400 color analyzers in 
recent years. Many of the Chinese publishers have to go to Hong 
Kong to get their high-quality color books printed. 
  "Our newly-developed technology has some features and 
functions which traditional electronic color analyzers do not 
have," Wang noted. "For example, publishers and printers can do 
all kinds of artistic processing and creative designs through a 
computer." 
  Due to its small size and low prices, Wang said, most small 
and medium-sized printing factories can afford to purchase the 
equipment. 
  According to Wang, the market for color printing equipment 
in 
China is worth at least two billion yuan.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--To relax 
grain supply tensions in some provinces and municipalities, 
China's Ministry of Internal Trade and State Grain Reserve 
Bureau held an emergency grain transfer work meeting in Beijing 
some days ago. At the meeting, the principle of doing unified 
planning with due consideration for all concerned and ensuring 
major areas was reaffirmed and concrete arrangements were made 
for grain allocations and transfers between provinces in the 
first quarter of the year. 
  According to the plan worked out at the meeting, in current 
grain allocations and transfers, it is necessary to implement 
the principle of making unified planning with due consideration 
for all concerned and ensuring major areas. The major areas to 
which grain will be transferred include eight provinces which 
are short of grain and three municipalities. The provinces are 
Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, Zhejiang, 
and the eastern part of Sichuan, and the municipalities are 
Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. When making arrangements for 
the grain transfer, priority will be given to special grain 
reserves, grain for market regulation, and grain for the 
fulfillment of trade contracts. 
  It has been learned that for January this year, various 
provinces have worked out special transportation plans, adding 
140 special trains for this purpose. This has added burdens to 
communications and transportation. The departments concerned 
are now discussing the issue with the railroad department to 
solve this problem. It is expected that in January, a plan to 
transport some 700,000 metric tons of grain will be fulfilled, 
including those which have already been transported, which will 
be 100,000 metric tons more than the original plan. In February 
and March, it is planned that a total of 4.1 million metric tons 
of grain will be transported.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of 
Agriculture Liu Jiang said here today that China's rural economy 
last year was better than expected. 
  Speaking at a national conference on rural work, the 
minister 
said that China produced more grain, meat, milk, eggs and 
aquatic products last year than in the previous year, but less 
cotton and sugar. 
  Liu said China achieved a bumper grain harvest last year, 
with the total grain output exceeding 450 million tons. 
  He said the total output of meat, milk, eggs and aquatic 
products increased by 5.5 percent, 6.4 percent, seven percent 
and 10 percent, respectively, over the previous year. 
  The total output and profits made by China's rural 
enterprises, which accounted for about one-third of the gross 
national product (GNP), both grew by at least 40 percent, said 
the minister. 
  The average per capita net income of China's farmers totaled 
880 yuan (about 151 U.S. dollars), representing a real increase 
of two percent over the previous year after inflation. 
  He attributed the progress to the policies and measures made 
by the central government to boost agricultural production and 
rural economy, and favorable weather for crops. 
  "Problems hindering the development of agricultural 
production still exist," said the minister. 
  He said some problems are outstanding, such as persistent 
low 
profits for farming, particularly for grain and cotton 
production. 
  He stressed that increases in farmers' income remain slow, 
adding that these increases are falling behind the growth rates 
for agricultural production and rural firms. 
  "a contrast between farmers' income and urban residents' 
income, which rose by 10 percent, is striking," said the 
official. 
  In addition, the country's agricultural technology extension 
network and research should be improved, said the minister, 
adding "the means of the central government's macro-control over 
agriculture is not adequate, and the foundation of agriculture 
remains weak." 
  He explained that the investment in agriculture is 
inadequate 
and a great area of cultivated land was used for industrial 
development and other purposes. 
  Talking about the growing pressure from surplus rural 
laborers, the minister said the surplus labor forces numbered 
about 100 million in 1993, an unemployed force which is growing 
at an annual rate of 13 million. 
  Liu said the vast number of surplus laborers hinders the 
increase in farmers' income, postpones the process of 
agricultural modernization, and also causes some social problems.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese agriculture 
minister Liu Jiang said today that some Chinese farm produce 
will be more competitive on the international market after China 
resumes its GATT status and unifies its dual-rate foreign 
exchange system. 
  Speaking at a four-day national conference on rural work, 
the 
minister said that with the resumption of China's status as a 
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) founding member 
country, some Chinese farm produce will have a broader 
international market. 
  "After China unifies its foreign exchange rates, prices of 
some farm produce will be more competitive, such as corn, 
soybeans, fruit, aquatic products and meat products," said the 
minister. 
  China unified its exchange rates on January 1 this year and 
is preparing to resume its GATT status. 
  However, production of some other agricultural products, 
such 
as wool, rubber, milk and milk products, and prawns, will 
inevitably be affected, since China will abolish some non-tariff 
protection measures, including the system of import and export 
licensing for and quotas on farm produce. 
  He said that China should actively readjust its agricultural 
product mix, make greater efforts to develop an export-oriented 
farm economy and improve the quality of its farm produce. 
  According to the minister, the export of farm produce and 
their finished products accounts for 40 percent of China's 
foreign exchange earnings. 
  Liu described exports as important in balancing the 
country's 
foreign exchange income and expenditure and in promoting 
agricultural development. 
  He admitted that the export of farm produce in recent years 
has not been "as good as it should be," attributing the problem 
mainly to low quality and lack of competitiveness. 
  "Rice is a traditional export product for China. Although 
its domestic prices have been lower than those on the 
international market in recent years, the total quantity of 
exported rice has be shrinking," said the minister. 
  He urged agricultural departments at all levels to help 
agro- 
businesses to set up group firms and improve the quality of farm 
produce, so as to rapidly increase international trade of 
China's agricultural products.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- China plans to 
produce at least 450 million tons of grain this year and 
increase the per capita net income of 900 million farmers by 
five percent. 
  Those are two of the targets unveiled here today by 
Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang at a national conference on rural 
work. 
  The minister said that China has set the production targets 
for cotton at 4.85 million tons and oil-bearing crops at 17 
million tons. 
  According to the plan, China is also expected to produce 
more 
meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit 
this year. 
  "In order to materialize the plan, priority of the 
agriculture and rural work this year will be given to increasing 
farmers' income, deepening rural economic restructuring and 
development of rural economy," said Liu. 
  He called for stable production increases for grain, cotton, 
meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit, 
and great efforts devoted to the development of the rural 
enterprises. 
  Liu said that "the work of increasing farmers' income should 
be the core of agriculture and rural work at present and for the 
rest of the 1990s." To steadily increase farmers' income is the 
foundation for stabilizing the countryside and the whole society. 
  "While paying close attention to raising farmers' income, 
efforts must be continued to reduce the financial burdens on 
farmers and to eliminate poverty," he added. 
  Starting this year, China will take a series of measures to 
push ahead the restructuring of the farm produce circulation 
system and market construction, including allowing the market to 
determine grain prices, after the government has purchased the 
contracted 50 million tons of grain. 
  In addition, China has started to set up a grain price 
protection system, a nationwide grain reserve system and a 
national fund for grain risks, all designed to protect the 
interests of grain producers when grain prices are too low to be 
profitable. 
  Liu also talked about the plans to improve the existing 
agriculture policies. 
  He said the central government also decided to earmark 
policy- based loans for economic development in China's major 
grain and cotton production centers, integration of trade, 
industry and agriculture in rural areas and development of rural 
firms in middle and west China. 
  The minister added that the investment in agricultural 
technology research and commodity grain production centers made 
by governments at all levels will be increased. 
  "Agricultural departments all over the country should try 
their best to induce governments at all levels, departments 
concerned, township and village collective economic units and 
farmers to increase their investment in agriculture."

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking today at a 
report meeting jointly held by the CPC Central Committee's 
Propaganda Department, the CPC Central Committee's Work 
Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's Work 
Committee for Government Organs, the People's Liberation Army's 
General Political Department, and the Beijing municipal party 
committee, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said: The year 1994 is 
crucial for fully expediting the reform process in accordance 
with the goal of establishing a socialist market economic 
system. Significant and wide-ranging steps toward financial and 
taxation reform will affect the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system, long-term national stability, and this 
year's financial state and economic development. They are the 
centerpiece of reform of the entire economic system. We must 
work hard to ensure success. 
  Liu Zhongli said: Since reform and opening up, we have not 
stopped reforming the financial and taxation systems. This has 
played an important role in promoting economic development. 
Constrained by the then-prevailing conditions, in our previous 
reform we emphasized readjustment of the distribution structure 
but failed to devote adequate efforts toward changing 
mechanisms. As reform has deepened continuously, the failings 
of the financial and taxation systems -- such as the irregular 
tax revenue system, the irrational distribution structure, and 
entrenched local interests -- have become increasingly 
pronounced, and they came to the fore when we implemented last 
year's budget. Therefore, faster financial and taxation reform 
is not only urgently required for creating a socialist market 
economic system but also for smoothing the relations of 
distribution and for ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. 
  Liu Zhongli said: A financial and taxation reform package -- 
which encompasses reform of the taxation system, the tax-sharing 
system, and the profit distribution system for state-owned 
enterprises -- covers all main aspects of the financial and 
taxation systems. The goal of reform is to change mechanisms, 
and to establish a new financial and taxation management system 
and operating mechanisms in keeping with the demands of 
socialist market economic development. Specifically, the goal 
is to smooth and regularize the relations of distribution 
between the central and local authorities, and between the state 
and enterprises; to improve the state's financial function; to 
enhance the central government's macroeconomic regulation and 
control; and to promote a beneficial economic circle and rapid 
economic development in our country. 
  Liu Zhongli said emphatically: Comprehensive reform of the 
financial and taxation systems can help coordinate various 
reform measures and avert friction between the old and new 
systems. He expressed the hope that all localities and 
departments would actively publicize the policy among cadres and 
people to dispel doubts, coordinate their actions with the 
overall situation of reform and development, promptly uncover 
and solve new problems in implementing reform measures, ensure 
that all reform measures would be put in place without delay, 
and achieve the desired results. 
  It is understood that all the study and report sessions 
jointly held by the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department 
and the other four departments have come to an end. Earlier, 
leaders of relevant departments -- including Hong Hu, vice 
minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission; Zhou 
Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China; Jin 
Xin, director of the State General Administration of Taxation; 
Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation; Yao Zhenyan, vice minister of the State Planning 
Commission; and Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State 
Council Research Office -- expounded the content, goals, and 
major implications of reform of the financial, taxation, 
banking, investment, and foreign trade systems. They had also 
introduced, theoretically and practically, our country's new 
ideas for future reform and development.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and </F>
Trade Commission: "China's Economy: Review and Prospects"] 
  [Text] With a great feeling of joy, we ring out the old 
year and usher in the new. Looking back on 1993, China's 
economy maintained its rapid rate of development, both the 
social and political situations remained stable, and the living 
standards of the people continued to rise. In addition, 
measures for macroeconomic control adopted by the central 
government achieved tangible returns, featuring healthy national 
economic development. 
  Compared with 1992, China's 1993 GDP rose by 13 percent, 
with 
total industrial output value rising by some 22 percent and 
agricultural output value by 4 percent. Aggregate investments 
in fixed social assets increased by 46 percent and the total 
import and export volume grew by 14 percent. 
  In the coming year it will be important for China to 
maintain 
rapid economic development, and a year crucial to the country's 
efforts to advance the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system. In line with the adoption of reform measures 
related to taxation, finance, investments and planning 
structures, China's national economy will improve further in 
terms of the macro- environment and there will be a golden 
opportunity to introduce new reforms and development. 
Economically speaking, investments in fixed assets will 
continue to rise somewhat. The national economy is expected to 
maintain a rapid rate of development, and a brisk market is 
expected, along with continued steady development. Substantial 
growth will be recorded in imports and exports and the 
introduction of foreign capital. 
<H5>  Looking Back on 1993 </H5>
  China's national economic development in 1993 had the 
following salient features: 
  -- Rapid economic development and distinct phased changes. 
China's GNP for the first half of 1993 represented an increase 
of 14.1 percent over the previous year's period, with industrial 
output up by 25.1 percent, while the output of state-owned 
enterprises rose 10 percent. Economic growth since the central 
government adopted macro-economic control measures has been on a 
progressive downward trend and tangible changes have taken place 
in stages. Compared with figures for the corresponding period 
in 1992, the country's total industrial output from January to 
October 1993 decreased by 1.9 percent. A sector breakdown 
reveals that output of heavy industry dropped by 3 percent, 
light industry by 0.8 percent, output of state-owned enterprises 
by 1.4 percent, collective enterprises by 4.9 percent, rural and 
township firms by 10.2 percent and other industrial enterprises 
by 2.5 percent. In terms of yearly figures, however, overall 
national economy saw a high growth rate in 1993. 
  -- Increase of economic returns. With a high growth rate in 
the industrial economy in 1993, the returns of industrial 
enterprises improved. The marketing rate of their products in 
the first nine months was at 94.48 percent, up 0.7 percentage 
point over the previous year's period. Industrial enterprises 
under state budget contributed 169.26 billion yuan in profits 
and taxes during the first nine months of the year, an increase 
of 38.3 percent. Such enterprises also recorded a 2.08-fold 
increase in profits for the period. However, in overall terms, 
the aggregative index of industrial economic benefits 
experienced a progressive decline. A survey of 360,000 
industrial enterprises at and above the township level which 
practice independent business accounting indicated that their 
aggregative index stood at 96.34 percent for the first six 
months, a fall of 2.97 percentage points compared with the 99.3 
percent figure for the first six months of the year. 
  -- Market development advances. At present, China's consumer 
goods market has initially developed into a network. The 
capital goods market was the subject of active progress and 
standardization was advanced step by step. Financial and stock 
markets experienced brisk development, with technological, 
information and real estate market emerging in certain areas. A 
market pricing system has also taken shape, and relations 
between domestic and international markets have been 
strengthened. 
  Even though China recorded progress in market construction 
during 1993, certain problems surfaced in terms of systems and 
orders. Efforts should be made to strengthen laws and 
regulations for standardizing the market as the mainstay, 
adjusting market relations, maintaining the market order and 
improving the economic environment, while at the same time 
coordinating the relationship between market construction and 
management. 
  -- The quality of economic operations has improved, but a 
comprehensive and coordinated effort must be further 
strengthened. Banking and economic orders took a turn for the 
better in 1993 as a result of the adoption of macroeconomic 
control measures. In addition, a number of prominent 
contradictions and problems related to economic activities were 
mitigated: the supply of major raw materials and social 
resources increased substantially; contradictions between power 
supply and demand were alleviated; and relevant reforms 
developed at an accelerated rate, organizing and coordinating 
activities related to instituting macroeconomic controls, 
measures were taken on the principle of group guidance and in 
accordance with different trades to solve contradictions and 
problems which emerged in the course of economic development. 
However, owing to a lack of experience, it is necessary to 
further explore ways to strengthen the work of making full use 
of macroeconomic control measures to comprehensively coordinate 
economic operations in the process of deepening reform. 
  -- Macroeconomic control achieved tangible returns. As part 
of its effort to solve contradictions and problems which 
resulted from rapid economic growth in the first half of 1993, 
the central government adopted various economic, legal and 
necessary administrative means to achieve order in the banking 
system. Thus far, the efforts have achieved remarkable 
progress. These efforts not only guaranteed healthy national 
economic development during 1993, but also created positive 
conditions for deepening reform of the economic structure in 
1994. 
<H5>  Prospects for 1994 </H5>
  Economic and trade efforts in 1994 will focus on 
enterprises, 
with emphasis on enterprise reform, cultivating new markets, 
undertaking technical renovations and updating enterprise 
management. Economic activities will be subject to 
comprehensive coordination in order to ensure sustained rapid 
and healthy national economic development. 
  -- The pace of reform of state-owned enterprises, especially 
large and medium-sized enterprises, will be accelerated. Wide- 
ranging reforms will include the following: 
  1. Actively establishing a modern enterprise management 
system, which represents the orientation of China's reform in 
state-owned enterprises. 
  2. Continuing to implement the Regulations on Changing the 
Management Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises and 
Regulations On the Supervision and Management of State-owned 
Assets, granting further decision-making power to enterprises in 
terms of management, and strengthening the management over 
preservation and increase of the value of state assets. 
  3. Accelerating readjustment of the organizational 
operations of large enterprises. 
  4. Consolidating the management of the business operations 
of enterprises. In line with the Bankruptcy Law of the People's 
Republic of China, enterprises which have sustained losses for 
an extended period or those whose assets cannot cover debt 
should apply for bankruptcy. Successful enterprises will be 
promoted, while those which fail will be eliminated. 
  5. Adopting practical measures to lighten the unreasonable 
burdens and debt of enterprises. 
  6. Increasing the amount of circulating funds available to 
enterprises through various channels. 
  -- The technological progress of enterprises will be 
vigorously promoted. In 1994, the technological development and 
renovation of enterprises will stress optimizing the structure 
and decreasing energy consumption and production costs, striving 
to reach the goal of rationalized technology and equipment, 
advancing industrial processes and raising the quality of new 
products. 
  -- The pace for market development will be accelerated in 
order to promote the establishment and perfection of the market 
system. The State Economic and Trade Commission will actively 
participate in the construction of a production-factors market 
for the finance, labor, real estate, technology and information 
sectors. Specific plans will be devised to achieve coordinated 
development. Intermediate service organizations for the market 
will be vigorously developed to make full use of their service, 
linking, notary and supervisory functions. Policies and 
measures related to the development of markets for various 
products will be adopted and priority will be given to the 
construction and improvement of bulk agricultural and 
by-products markets, as well and the capital goods market. 
[sentence as published] The State Economic and Trade Commission 
will adopt guidelines for further expanding the sales scope for 
certain commodities and will further activate commodity 
circulation in rural areas. The commission will cooperate with 
related departments in the effort to promote the development of 
chain retail stores and supermarkets throughout the country, and 
develop markets for other commodities. 
  -- The import and export business of enterprises will be 
properly handled and foreign trade developed. Attention will 
focus on the following: 
  1. Actively using foreign capital to accelerate the 
technological renovation of old enterprises. 
  2. Simplifying tax reimbursement procedures regarding export 
commodities. 
  3. Drafting policies and measures designed to upgrade export 
commodities, ensure product quality, and expand exports of 
textiles, machinery, electronic and technology-intensive 
products. The overall structure of export commodities will be 
readjusted. 
  4. Granting enterprises import and export rights in order to 
help solve related problems. 
  5. Stepping up contacts with foreign governments, banks and 
foundations. Efforts will be made to collect and master more 
information related to international cooperation and opening new 
channels to support and guide enterprises in efforts to expand 
cooperation and exchanges with foreign economic entities. 
  6. Conducting research on policies and measures regarding 
China's early re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  7. Adopting a general program to gradually lower the general 
level of tariffs and rationally readjust the structure of 
tariffs at the earliest possible date. Adjustment measures, 
such as establishing provisional tax rates, will be adopted to 
promote the development of agriculture, industry, and foreign 
trade. 
  -- Conscientious efforts will be made to enact comprehensive 
economic laws and regulations. In a certain sense, a market 
economy is regulated by law. Consequently great attention will 
be directed to strengthening economic laws and regulations. 
Efforts in 1994 will center on enterprise reform and market 
construction, and research and work will be undertaken to draft 
and complete laws and regulations regarding the standardization 
and expansion of the market, readjusting the trade relationships 
of markets, maintaining the market order, establishing 
macroeconomic controls and improving the economic environment. 
The establishment of economic laws and regulations will be 
combined with structural reform and economic development. 
Attempts will be made to explore new effective ways to use laws 
and regulations to ensure the comprehensive coordination of the 
economy. 
  -- Great effort will also be extended to strengthening and 
improving macroeconomic controls and regulations, and 
coordinating the economic operations of various sectors. 
Relationships between various sectors and industries of the 
national economy will be given full consideration, and emphasis 
will be placed on coordinating the relationship between 
production and circulation, internal and external trade, and 
markets and enterprises

<F P=106> [By correspondents Zheng Zhihai (6774 1807 3189) and Lu </F>
Gang (0712 0474): "National Conference on Foreign Economic 
Relations and Trade Opens: Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
System To Undergo Significant Reforms"] 
  [Text] A conference on national foreign economic relations 
and trade opened 7 December in Beijing with some 400 attendees, 
all of them persons in charge of departments (committees, 
bureaus), special foreign trade companies, and industrial and 
commercial enterprises of provinces, cities, autonomous regions, 
and cities separately listed in plans across the country, and 
organs and units directly affiliated with the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]. The 
conference's central agenda was: Guided by the spirit of the 
14th CPC Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central 
Committee and outlined by the national economic work conference, 
study and arrange for next year's various tasks concerning 
speeding up reforms and development and promoting the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of China's foreign trade. 
  The conference was chaired by MOFTEC Vice Minister Zheng 
Silin, who is also party group deputy secretary. Wu Yi, MOFTEC 
minister and party group secretary, delivered a report, entitled 
"Conscientiously Implement the Spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th Central Committee and Speed Up the 
Development of China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade." 
  Having reviewed the heartening progress in China's foreign 
economic relations and trade, Wu Yi pointed out: The guiding 
thought for next year's foreign economic relations and trade is 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the deepening of the spirit of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee. Efforts 
will be powered by a deepening of reforms in the foreign 
economic and trade sector and will center on expanding exports. 
We will actively earn foreign exchanges, raise economic 
efficiency, seize opportunities, meet challenges, explore 
actively, struggle arduously, work hard to complete next year's 
foreign economic tasks in excess of planned quotas, and 
contribute our share of effort toward reforms, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  -- Further deepen reform in the foreign economic and trade 
sector. Beginning next year, state foreign trade and export 
enterprises will pursue a unified foreign currency settlement 
system and install a unified and managed renminbi floating 
exchange rate system based on market demand and supply. These 
enterprises will not be required to submit noncompensatory and 
compensatory foreign-exchange earnings. 
  In deepening reforms in the foreign economic and trade 
sector, we must, one, perfect the macroregulatory and control 
mechanism for exports; two, further deregulate in an orderly 
fashion import and export operations; three, deepen reforms in 
foreign economic and trade enterprises and reorganize 
state-owned foreign economic and trade enterprises modelling on 
modern corporate systems; four, maintain the unity of foreign 
economic and trade policies throughout the country and increase 
transparency; and five, strengthen coordinated macromanagement, 
maintain good order in foreign trade, and strengthen the 
functions of commercial chambers. 
  -- Peruse our jobs vigorously to ensure the completion of 
next year's foreign trading and export and import tasks. On the 
basis of a conscientious summing up of this year's experience, 
beginning early next year, we will take expanding exports as the 
central task. All types of foreign trade enterprises have a 
responsibility to earn foreign exchange for the country. They 
must increase their contributions toward increasing the state's 
exports and foreign exchange earnings, correctly handle the 
relations between specializing in one trade and diversified 
operations and between exporting to earn foreign exchange and 
economic efficiency, and give top priority to export expansion. 
Meanwhile, they must also guarantee the export of key materials 
to meet the needs of national economic development. Leading 
foreign trade departments at all levels should make it their job 
to provide detailed and sophisticated guidance for various types 
of foreign economic and trade enterprises and offer quality 
services and wholeheartedly solve problems for enterprises in 
expanding their exports. 
  -- Sum up experience, perfect policies, and actively and 
effectively utilize foreign capital. 
  -- Further promote foreign aid and the development of 
foreign 
economic cooperation; continue to implement new foreign aid 
policies, adjust the foreign-aid structure, and reform its 
methods; continue to probe for a variety of aid methods in which 
aid, mutual benefits, and cooperation are combined; vigorously 
pursue direct cooperation between our country's enterprises and 
their counterparts in aided countries, open overseas solely 
invested or joint-venture enterprises through foreign aid; 
further perfect foreign-aid management; and standardize and 
manage foreign aid work scientifically. 
  Further convert the internal mechanisms of firms engaged in 
international economic and technological cooperation, perfect 
the macromanagement mechanism for contract projects and labor 
cooperation, work hard to raise levels of design and consultancy 
for overseas contracted construction projects and labor 
cooperation, diversify contract labor markets, and integrate 
foreign economic cooperation with investment, trade, and other 
related areas in moving toward a "great economic and trade 
pattern." 
  -- Uphold principles and handle properly multilateral and 
bilateral trade ties. 
  -- Develop economic and trade cooperation with Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, and Macao. Under the general policy of "peaceful 
unification and one country, two systems," we will vigorously 
promote economic exchanges and trade between the mainland and 
the Taiwan region, focusing on attracting large and medium-scale 
Taiwan-funded projects and increasing exports to Taiwan in order 
to further expand cross- Strait economic cooperation and trade. 
While maintaining Hong Kong's and Macao's prosperity and 
stability and achieving a smooth transition as the goal, we will 
work hard to consolidate and develop economic and trade ties 
with the Hong Kong and Macao region, continue to maintain 
supplies to Hong Kong and Macao, fully exploit Hong Kong's 
unique status and advantages as a financial, trade, transport, 
and information center and put these advantages at the service 
of expanding the mainland's opening up and modernization. 
  -- Continue to unwaveringly implement market diversification 
and the strategy of achieving good quality. Regions and 
foreign-trade enterprises must heighten their understanding, 
draw up plans, and adopt effective measures. While 
consolidating and developing existing markets, they must 
vigorously open new ones and improve the setup of foreign 
economic and trade markets. Strong and big enterprises with 
goodwill must make stronger effort at opening new markets. 
Pursuing the strategy of achieving good quality next year will 
focus on cracking down on fake and inferior products. The 
problem of quality will be understood as one that reflects 
national character and affects our country's image of reform and 
opening up. To achieve good quality, ultimately we rely on: 
One, science and technology; two, policies; and three, 
management. We must cooperate fully with scientific and 
technological, production, commercial inspection, and customs 
departments and genuinely strengthen quality control and 
supervision in a vigorous attempt to achieve a notable 
improvement in the quality of our country's exports. 
  -- Continue to push hard for setting up a foreign economic 
and trade legal system. The "foreign trade law" has been 
adopted in principle by a routine State Council executive 
meeting and is going to be reviewed by the National people's 
Congress Standing Committee. The "anti-dumping ordinance," 
"anti-subsidy ordinance," and "protective measures ordinances" 
will be submitted to the State Council for review and approval. 
Next year, efforts will focus on formulating ancillary rules 
and regulations for the "foreign trade law" and specific details 
for implementing the three above ordinances, revising or 
drafting laws and rules and regulations on the use of foreign 
capital in line with the adjustment and perfection of foreign 
capital policies, genuinely tightening inspection and 
supervision of the unified implementation of foreign economic 
and trade policies, and further increasing transparency. 
Meanwhile, we must firmly stop and correct such wrong tendencies 
as not observing the law, lax enforcement of the law, and 
levying fines instead of lawfully required punishments and must 
conscientiously review the complaint-response method concerning 
antidumping work by boosting investigations and studies, 
formulating relevant rules and regulations as quickly as 
possible, and setting up standardized procedures for 
investigations and complaint response. 
  -- On the Central Committee's and State Council's unified 
planning and revolving around the central tasks in the foreign 
economic and trade sector, we will vigorously strengthen the 
clean government effort and party style. 
  -- Do a good job in government organ reforms and strengthen 
the construction of foreign economic and trade cadre contingents. 
  Lastly, Wu Yi said: The most important of all the important 
tasks for next year is to deepen reforms in the foreign economic 
and trade sector, make good use of state policies, increase 
exports and foreign exchange earnings to new levels, and pay 
particular attention to ensuring a rise in the growth of exports 
and foreign exchange earnings in general trade.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) --- China is becoming 
increasingly involved in worldwide economic competition by 
exporting its own goods, technologies, labor services and 
capital, according to a researcher at the China Foreign Policy 
Studies Center. 
  In an interview with XINHUA today, Yan Xuetong noted that 
commodities exports furnish the best example of what he calls 
"two- way exchange between the Chinese and world economies." 
  Yan estimated that such exports may reach 91 billion U.S. 
dollars in 1993, up from 85 billion in 1992 and compared with a 
mere 9.74 billion in 1978 when the policy of reform and opening 
to the world became official. 
  "There was an annual average growth of 18 percent between 
1978 and 1992," he said. "In 1978, China ranked 32nd among all 
countries in terms of annual commodities exports and in 1992, it 
advanced to the 11th." 
  Manufactured goods now account for at least 80 percent of 
China's exports. In 1978, however, the bulk of China's exports 
were primary products, he added. 
  China was a pure importer of technologies before 1981 when, 
for the first time, it signed six contracts on technological 
exports. Since then, the country has concluded 1,100 contracts, 
involving 3.4 billion dollars. 
  However, Yan was far from being satisfied, noting that the 
1992 transactions -- 1.4 billion dollars -- was only two percent 
of the country's commodities exports. 
  Export of capital was also something new for China. By the 
end of 1982, the country had invested 37 million dollars in 43 
projects abroad. 
  By the end of 1992, Yan said, China's overseas investment 
had 
snowballed to 1.85 billion dollars in 4,117 projects. 
  "Few Chinese-funded projects are in commerce or trade meant 
for direct profits," he noted. "Instead, 86 percent of the 
Chinese investment has gone to projects producing iron ore and 
other raw materials to make up for domestic shortages." 
  At the end of June 1993, 157,000 Chinese workers were 
working 
abroad to perform labor service contracts, mostly in 
construction and other manual labor jobs. 
  Yan, an economist trained at the University of California at 
Berkeley of the U.S., held that China should start organizing 
the export of intellectual labor services by making use of its 
eight million scientists and engineers. 
  "Economically, the country is linked with the world, and has 
to prepare itself for closer links," concluded Yan, who serves 
as deputy director of the center which operates under the China 
Institute of Contemporary International Relations. 
  Since 1985, China has published a series of laws designed in 
part to promote integration of the Chinese and world economies, 
including laws on patents, trademarks and copyrights. Also, 
China has joined the world intellectual property organization 
and acceded to the Paris Convention for the Protection of 
Industrial Property and the Universal Copyright Convention. 
  Meanwhile, China has lowered its import duties.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "New Funds To Aid Bond Sales"] </F>
  [Text] China is expected to see a breakthrough in the 
development of investment funds in 1994. 
  The country is considering the establishment of some 
treasury 
bond investment funds this year, according to an official with 
the Bank of China. 
  He said the country is expected to issue 100 billion yuan 
($17.5 billion) worth of government bonds in 1994. Of these, 80 
percent will be sold to financial institutions and the rest to 
individuals. 
  The official said the investment funds are expected to 
smooth 
the issuing of treasury bonds, which encountered some problems 
last year. 
  Furthermore, the official said, several investment funds 
will 
be launched for some key construction projects. 
  For example, the Three Gorges Project, which will involve 
more than 95.4 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) in investment, will 
probably launch some funds to pool capital. 
  The official said more domestic institutions and ventures 
will cooperate with overseas partners to set up overseas-based 
funds. 
  These funds will be used to raise foreign capital to invest 
in domestic construction projects. 
  He said some American institutional investors are 
negotiating 
with Chinese partners about setting up some electric power 
investment funds. 
  The official said many investment funds are expected to be 
listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. 
  The funds will play an important role in the stabilization 
of 
the stock market since funds are usually engaged in long-term 
investment instead of short-term speculation. 
  And the investment funds will also offer a new form of 
investment to Chinese punters, since most of them know little 
about securities, and allow them to play the stock market more 
safely. 
  China's first investment fund was born in 1991. So far there 
are 50 funds involving 4.5 billion yuan ($789 million) in the 
country. 
  The country last year originally planned to allot 3 billion 
yuan ($526.3 million) in quotas to the investment funds. 
  But the plan had to be postponed to ensure enough capital 
for 
the country's key construction projects because the country's 
capital resources are in short supply. 
  He said the country will launch a massive programme this 
year 
to standardize the existing investment funds. 
  And the central bank has drafted a set of regulations on the 
management of funds. The draft has been submitted to the State 
Council and is waiting for final approval. 
  He said the country will set up specialized fund-management 
corporations in some areas. 
  And a fund union will be established this year to enhance 
the 
self-management of the funds sector, the official said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (CNS)--According to an 
authoritative person in financial circles in the country, China 
will not open its gold market in the near future to foreign 
businessmen nor does the unification of domestic gold prices 
with the international ones mean gold may be freely imported and 
exported. 
  At present, the production and sale of gold in China is 
subject to control by the People's Bank of China, the central 
bank in the country and its import and export are limited by 
state control. In order to meet the needs of the market 
economy, the state will consider the establishment of 
specialized gold markets in which designated enterprises will be 
allowed to engage in gold trading in line with the needs of 
their production and the state will no longer offer gold 
materials for production purposes to such enterprises, gradually 
opening the gold market to the outside world and allowing gold 
to be traded in a free way. 
  After a price adjustment for the buying and selling of gold, 
the state will abolish its favourable policies for the gold 
industry including policy-based subsidies, low interest loans 
and the exemption of tax. Under current circumstances, however, 
it is not suitable for the market for gold production and sales 
to be opened to foreign businessmen and the imports and exports 
of gold will remain under the mandatory control by the central 
bank.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Tariffs on Automobiles To Drop"] </F>
  [Text] China last week announced a 70 percent tariff 
reduction on auto imports effective on January 1 this year. 
  The country had previously imposed tariffs ranging from 1.8 
to 2.2 times the actual car price on imports to protect its 
fledgling car manufacturing industry. 
  However, a senior official from the China Trade Centre for 
Automobile Imports said this will not effect imports to a great 
extent, as the devaluation of the renminbi will increase the 
prices of imports on the domestic market. 
  The trading centre, established last year, is expected to 
play a more important role in overseeing the country's car 
imports. 
  The official predicted that in fact fewer foreign-built cars 
and vans will enter China's mainland this year than in 1993. 
  Estimates from Chinese automobile trading firms show that 
about 400,000 foreign-made cars and vans entered the mainland 
market in 1993. 
  The vehicles, in various brands, were brought in by Chinese 
Government purchasing groups, trading firms, and smugglers. 
  The imported cars and vans, an all-time high for the 
country, 
squeezed domestically-made vehicle sales on the home market. 
  The official predicted such a big inflow will not take place 
this year despite the drop in tariffs. 
  The official said the government took measures to block 
routes used by smugglers last year--and will beef up those 
measures this year. 
  The number of cars and vans smuggled into China in 1993 was 
estimated at 100,000, compared with 90,000 in 1992. 
  The central government is now reconsidering its policy that 
allows overseas-funded firms to buy duty free foreign-made cars 
and vans. 
  To date, the government has approved more than 150,000 
foreign invested projects. 
  Some overseas-funded enterprises bought duty-free cars so 
they could profiteer by selling them to China's car-hungry 
consumers. 
  As a result of the inflow of foreign made vehicles sales of 
domestic cars decreased month by month and some plants had to 
reduce production in face of rising stockpiles. 
  Besides automobile manufacturing, producers of other 
vehicles 
also were hit by a market recession that started in July. 
  The recession was also attributed to the government's tight 
credit policy and a nationwide anticorruption drive. 
  The credit policy has weakened the purchasing power of 
enterprises and the anticorruption drive reduced institutional 
car buying. 
  In China, where per capita gross national product stands at 
some $400, automobiles are regarded as luxury consumer items. 
  Car stockpiles, although showing a downward curve after 
October, remained higher than in the first half of 1993. 
  Exact figures are unavailable. Reports say State targets for 
car production for 1993 was probably unfulfilled.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Quality of Traded Goods Rises </F>
a Notch in 1993"] 
  [Text] The quality of imported and exported goods improved 
in 1993, commodity inspection officials said yesterday. 
  The State Administration for Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities said that it examined nearly $61 billion worth of 
goods during the first 10 months of last year, 29 percent more 
than during the same period in 1992. 
  Starting last year, the administration began tightening 
inspection to make sure that goods entering and leaving the 
country met required standards. 
  Officials found nearly $241 million worth of export products 
and nearly $1.3 billion of imported goods to be substandard. 
  Last year, imports hit $100 billion and exports $90 billion, 
with foreign trade volume increasing 15 percent over 1992. 
  The administration said that despite increased inspections, 
the percentage of substandard exports last year dropped from 
1992, indicating an improvement in the quality of domestic 
products. 
  During the first 10 months of last year, 8 per cent of 
inspected exports failed to meet standards, a .52 percentage 
point drop over the same period in 1992. 
  The inspection authority also noted that its efforts have 
been conducive to the smooth development of China's foreign 
trade. 
  The country's machinery products that were sold abroad were 
among China's top quality exports, it said. 
  Some domestic chemical products, however, were banned from 
being sold overseas, officials said. 
  Rapidly growing imports last year burdened inspectors who 
checked nearly $30.7 billion worth of foreign goods bought by 
the mainland during the first 10 months of 1993. 
  This was an increase of nearly 40 percent over the same 
period in 1992. 
  The administration said the quality of imports has improved. 
Only 41 per cent of inspected goods were substandard last year, 
versus 47.9 percent the year before. 
  During the first 10 months of last year, farm and sideline 
imported products had the biggest quality control problems, 
officials said. 
  According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co- 
operation (Moftec), growing domestic demand for industrial and 
agricultural products spurred China's imports last year. 
  The government's investment in fixed assets, which was 1,150 
billion yuan ($113 billion) last year, stimulated Chinese 
companies' demand for foreign industrial products mainly in the 
transportation, telecommunication and energy sectors. 
Meanwhile, a 500,000-ton decrease in domestic cotton production 
and fast-growing demand for foodstuffs also helped boost the 
country's purchases of foreign farm products. 
  According to Customs figures, major imports covered 
machinery, electronics, light industrial, minerals and 
agricultural and animal by-products. 
  Among exports, Customs said that goods going overseas 
improved in quality and included farm and sideline products, 
textiles, machinery and minerals. 
  China also made a breakthrough in tapping new overseas 
trading partners, although it kept key commercial relations with 
Japan, Hong Kong, the United States and the European Community.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Beijing by trainee reporter Yang Fan (2799 </F>
1581): "Director of the Finance Research Institute Under the 
People's Bank of China Says That the Central Government Has Been 
Ready for Dealing With the Possibility of Exchange Rate 
Fluctuations"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (WEN WEI PO) -- Today, Qin Chijiang, 
director of the Finance Research Institute of the People's Bank 
of China, told this reporter: It is inevitable and courageous 
to unify the exchange rates of renminbi on 1 January, and the 
central government is ready for dealing with possible 
fluctuations in the exchange rates. 
  Qin Chijiang said: Unification of the exchange rates is the 
prerequisite for the establishment of a socialist market 
economy, which is favorable to converging with the international 
currency market and is very beneficial to our current economy. 
  1. In the past, when foreign enterprises invested in China, 
converted their incomes in renminbi for foreign exchange, and 
remitted the money to their own countries, they had to use the 
swap rate rather than the official exchange rate. Foreign 
businessmen regarded this practice as "discrimination." Now, 
the exchange rates have been unified, this obstacle has been 
removed, and it is beneficial to foreign investment in China. 
  2. It is beneficial for foreigners in other ways besides 
trade transactions. When they come to China, they can exchange 
their own currency for more renminbi according to the market 
swap rate rather than the official rate. Of course, the 
domestic situation is a direct contrast. Since the prices of 
buying foreign currency are higher, there is a heavier burden. 
3. For China's enterprises engaging in foreign trade, the 
unification of the exchange rates has pros and cons, and they 
have to sell their foreign currency earned to banks according to 
the swap rate and buy foreign currency from banks according to 
the swap rate, but the system has become more reasonable. 
  He said: Whether or not the time is ripe to unify the 
exchange rates should be determined by whether or not renminbi 
is a stable currency, whether or not there is a balance of 
international payments, whether or not the central bank's 
intervention capability is strong, and whether or not the 
relationship between domestic demand and supply is governed by 
the mechanism. Controversy over the question of whether or not 
the time is ripe remains. Some people question that with the 
emergence of trade deficits, a huge domestic demand, an 
extremely high degree of fixed-asset investment, and 
insufficient competitive power of domestic products, if large 
fluctuations of the exchange rate will occur following the 
unification of the exchange rates. But Qin Chijiang said: The 
unification of exchange rates is a very courageous measure, and 
as long as the government is mentally prepared and appropriately 
utilizes policies and measures, there is no need to fear, even 
if large fluctuations occur. 
<H3>  Free Conversion of Renminbi in Trade Must Be Realized Before 
Readmission to GATT </H3>
  Responding the question of what measures the government 
would 
prepare, Qin Chijiang cited an example and said: The government 
has reduced the tariff rates of certain imports and this helps 
stabilize the exchange rate. When fluctuations occur in the 
foreign exchange market, the central bank will interfere with 
foreign exchange. If there is large domestic demand for foreign 
exchange, the central bank can also take the measure of 
tightening the supply of currency and putting less renminbi into 
circulation, and, as a result, the prices of renminbi in 
exchange for foreign exchange will naturally rise. As 
unification of the exchange rates is the first step of free 
conversion of renminbi, when will free conversion be realized? 
Director Qin said: Free conversion of renminbi in trade must be 
realized before we are readmitted to GATT, whereas free 
conversion of renminbi in nontrade activities will depend on 
improvement of domestic management standard and will take a 
longer time, but it is not possible to realize free conversion 
of capital because there is a great domestic demand for capital 
and the outflow of domestic capital through free conversion is 
not allowed.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Important Measure for Establishing </F>
a Modernized Enterprise System"] 
  [Text] New China's first corporate law has been officially 
promulgated. This event is of great significance to promoting 
the development of the socialist market economy, forming a 
matching legal system, establishing a modern enterprise system, 
and standardizing the microbasis of the market economy. 
  The Corporate Law is an important law for standardizing the 
main body of the market economy. Its functions include 
standardizing corporate organization and behavior, protecting 
the legitimate rights and interests of companies, shareholders, 
and creditors, and maintaining social and economic order. It 
cultivates, in a legal form, the main body of the market that 
caters to the needs of large- scale socialized production and 
the market economy and improves the system of legal entities in 
China. This is a foundational project for the establishment of 
the socialist market economy that integrates the economic 
structural reform with the building of an economic legal system, 
activates and protects economic reform with economic 
legislation, and standardizes and codifies the measures of 
enterprise reform and the achievements of the reform. The 
making of the Corporate Law embodies the principle set by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee that 
calls for close integration of reform decisions and legislative 
decisions. The Corporate Law has been brought forth in pace 
with the needs of the enterprise reform. It not only is a 
result of the effort to sum up experiences and consolidate what 
has been achieved, but also promotes and protects enterprise 
reform by wielding legal authority, so that this reform may make 
steady, yet vigorous progress on the broad road paved by the law. 
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a natural 
requirement of the development of large-scale socialized 
production and market economy. It points to the direction of 
the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. A company is an 
important, typical form of modern enterprise and is a product of 
the development of large-scale socialized production and market 
economy. Company, a form of enterprise organization 
standardized by law, can effectively separate corporate equity 
from ownership of promoters. In a company, the relationship 
between operational power and ownership is well-defined, the 
organizational and management system is scientific and rational, 
rights and responsibilities are clearly demarcated, various 
parties to the company check on each other, and risks are 
distributed in a way that is also conducive to fund-raising. It 
not only effectively protects the rights and interests of the 
owner, but also gives full decisionmaking power to the operator. 
Enterprise management and capital are separated from government 
administration, which is made possible by the relationship 
between the operational power and the ownership and the mode of 
property organization, so that the state is freed from its 
unlimited liability for enterprises. These legal principles 
embodied in the Corporate Law are the very basic requirements of 
a modern enterprise system. The making of the Corporate Law is 
in keeping with the demand on the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system and has a positive role to play in renewing 
the enterprise system with concentrated efforts and in further 
emancipating and developing the productive forces. 
  A company is built on the basis of concentration of capital. 
This determines the following important features that are 
inherent in a company: One, a company is set up in a 
responsibility form, not in accordance with ownership or 
administrative jurisdiction: and two, the concept of company 
connotes diversified economic sectors and investments from a 
variety of sources, as the corporate form can be used by owners 
of different natures. The relevant provisions in the Corporate 
Law are based on China's national conditions and were made by 
drawing upon and assimilating useful experience of other 
countries in corporate legislation while close attention is 
given to practical experience and the needs of development. As 
to the specific corporate form, two major forms, namely, the 
limited liability company and the joint-stock company with 
limited liability, are prevalent and found in large quantities 
in China. The Corporate Law gives due regard to the 
characteristics of our country and contains separate provisions 
on solely state-owned ones among limited liability companies, 
which are designed to meet the needs arising from the 
reorganization of state-owned enterprises into companies. Such 
stipulations conform to China's national conditions and indicate 
a dynamic, yet cautious effort. 
  Making the Corporate Law means establishing a standardized 
corporate system in accordance with the requirements of the 
modern enterprise system. The corporate system is a common 
asset of mankind, but for it to play a truly positive role as a 
scientific form of enterprise organization, we must adhere to 
standardization and the legal premises and requirements for 
incorporation or reorganization of companies. Incorporation of 
companies and reorganization of enterprises into companies can 
go ahead only when the required conditions are ready; otherwise, 
incorporation or forced reorganization is not allowed. To 
ensure its correct enforcement, the Corporate Law contains the 
special chapter "Legal Responsibility" which stipulates that 
violators of this law will be called to account. Existing 
companies must be screened also in accordance with the 
provisions of the Corporate Law. The procedures and specific 
methods to follow in implementation are governed by the State 
Council's stipulation. 
  The enforcement of the Corporate Law as well as the 
establishment of the modern enterprise system is an arduous and 
complex job. It requires meticulous organization, close 
cooperation among related departments, and concerted efforts in 
the renewal of China's enterprise system, so as to help promote 
the development of the socialist market economy.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Law To Put Controls on Commercial </F>
Insurance"] 
  [Text] China's first insurance law will prohibit 
government departments and banks from setting up insurance 
companies, according to a senior insurance official. 
  Qin Daofu, head of the drafting committee for the law, said 
the ban will prevent these departments from using their 
influence and connections to control the insurance market. 
  At present several departments such as the Ministry of 
Labour 
and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, are involved in the insurance 
business in one way or another. 
  He said after the passing of the law, which is scheduled for 
some time next year, these departments will only be authorized 
to engage in social insurance business, such as unemployment 
insurance and pension schemes. 
  The drafting of the law is nearly finished, Qin said, adding 
that the committee studied insurance laws in 16 countries and 
regions, including both developed and developing countries and 
regions, while doing its work. 
  After the law comes into effect China's insurance market 
will 
have a comprehensive legal framework to ensure fair competition, 
normal market operations and healthy development of the 
industry, he said. 
  Under the law, the People's Bank of China will supervise the 
industry. The bank will be responsible for ensuring insurance 
companies fulfill the obligations they undertake in their 
policies. 
  Qin said the guidance of the People's Bank of China is aimed 
at maintaining order in the insurance business. And an 
insurance association, which will be a self-disciplinary 
organization, is expected to be established in the future. 
  The law will also require new insurance companies to be 
formed as stock or mutual companies, he said. 
  At present, the Chinese insurance market is dominated by the 
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which has a 
97-percent market share. The rest of the market is divided 
between the Shanghai-based Pacific Insurance Company, China 
Pingan Insurance Company in Shenzhen, Agriculture Insurance 
Company in Xinjiang, and eight life insurance companies, Qin 
said. 
  The law will apply equally to foreign-funded insurance 
companies, he said. A foreign-funded company, if registered in 
China, will be considered a domestic company. These companies 
don't have to lodge a deposit with the People's Bank of China as 
they have registered capital. 
  However, under the law, branches of foreign insurance 
companies will be required to lodge a deposit guarantee with the 
People's Bank. 
  They will also have to have a permanent Chinese resident as 
their representative. 
  The law will also empower the People's Bank to make other 
relevant regulations to govern the industry, he said. 
  Qin said many foreign insurance companies are eyeing the 
vast 
potential of the Chinese insurance market. 
  So far, more than 20 foreign insurance and brokers companies 
have opened representative or liaison offices in the country and 
two of them, the American International Group and the 
London-based Sedgwick Group, have opened branches in Shanghai 
and Beijing respectively. 
  China's insurance industry has seen rapid growth in recent 
years. 
  In 1992, the total property insurance policies in the 
country 
reached 4.56 trillion yuan ($786 billion)-44.7 percent more than 
the previous year. 
  Some 700,000 firms and 143 million families are covered by 
property insurance policies, while 313 million people have 
bought personal insurance policies.

"Rapidly Growing Maritime Industry in China"] 
  [Text] The vast oceans account for 71 percent of the 
earth's surface. The UN General Assembly once proposed that all 
nations take the development and utilization of the seas and 
oceans as a strategy for human society's economic development. 
  China has 18,000 kilometers of mainland coastline and 14,000 
kilometers of island coastline. The area of China's territorial 
seas is as large as one-third of its land territory. In the 
history of China's civilization of several thousand years, only 
such traditional industries as fishing, salt making, and 
maritime transportation were related to the seas and oceans. 
However, people with lofty ideals in China have made continuous 
explorations in the development of maritime resources. When 
history came to the beginning of reform and opening, in 1979, 
the output value of China's maritime industries was only 7.4 
billion yuan. Since then, however, the coastal and maritime 
areas' geographical and resource advantages have been gradually 
perceived by the Chinese people. In recent years, there has 
been substantial development of China's maritime industries, and 
great efforts have been made to intensively build the framework 
of maritime industries. 
<H5>  Opening--Coastal Areas Take the Lead </H5>
  In the early stage of reform and opening, people first found 
that the seas and oceans had the geographic advantage of facing 
the world. China first set up four special economic zones in 
coastal areas, and then opened up 14 coastal cities and set up a 
special economic zone on Hainan Island and developed a large 
number of coastal economic and technological development zones. 
Great efforts were made to build ports, develop foreign trade, 
attract foreign investment, and adopt advanced foreign 
technology.... 
  In the 1990's, China set up more than 10 bonded areas along 
the coastline, from Dalian to Hainan, in order to converge with 
international practice and promote the further development of 
the coastal economies. Now, the coastal provinces and 
municipalities, which account for 13 percent of the country's 
territory, produce 60 percent of the gross national product and 
feed 40 percent of the nation's comparatively wealthier 
population. The economy there is full of vigor and dynamism. 
<H5>  Development--Acquiring Wealth From the Seas and Oceans </H5>
  When making use of the coastal geographical advantages, many 
other areas have also further developed their marine resource 
advantages. From the mouth of the Yalu Jiang in Liaoning to the 
mouth of the Beilun He in Guangxi, the State Oceanography Bureau 
has carried out large-scale comprehensive coastal surveys and 
island resources surveys, and this has further broadened 
people's vision. The development of new and high-tech maritime 
technologies in China has provided the means to develop new 
maritime industries. With the development of such new 
industries as aquaculture, offshore oil and gas exploration, 
maritime tourism, maritime minerals and chemicals, seawater 
utilization, and maritime services, China's maritime industrial 
output value (not including the shipbuilding industry) increased 
by an average of 19 percent each year between 1980 and 1990 and 
reached 43.8 billion yuan in 1990, 53.1 billion yuan in 1991, 
and 75.5 billion yuan in 1992. 
  In this period of high-speed economic growth in China, which 
has attracted the world's attention, China's maritime industries 
increased production by 28 percent annually in these three 
years. It is expected that this year's output value will top 90 
billion yuan. The area of sea surface used for aquaculture has 
reached 500,000 hectares, and output has reached 2.42 million 
tonnes, first in the world. The annual volume of freight 
handled in coastal ports throughout the country has reached 600 
million tonnes, and the total tonnage of cargo ships ranks 
eighth in the world. Annual freight transportation has reached 
1,190.8 billion kilometer tons. Output of offshore oil and gas 
has reached 3.8 million tonnes. Output of maritime salt has 
reached 19.78 million tonnes. Coastal and maritime tourism has 
received 9.16 million people and an income of over 11.6 billion 
yuan. At present, a large number of foreign oil companies have 
invested billions of U.S. dollars of capital to explore for 
offshore oil and gas resources in China's territorial seas. 
China has also built power plants to using tidal energy in 
Shandong and Zhejiang. A maritime chemical industry, a maritime 
biochemical industry, industry directly using seawater, and a 
maritime mining industry have all been started. In our country, 
the maritime industries have been changed from a pattern of 
mainly being composed of traditional industries into a new 
pattern of being composed of both traditional and new industries. 
  The maritime industries, especially the new industries 
related to the seas and oceans, have the characteristics of 
possessing high technology, requiring high investment, facing 
high risks, and bringing about high economic efficiency. 
Maritime industrial development must rely on new and high 
technologies. Through many years of development, China now has 
more than 100 maritime scientific education and research 
institutes of all types and has set up maritime scientific and 
technological development zones and estates in Qingdao, Dalian, 
Dandong, and Tianjin for developing new maritime technologies 
and products. In addition, China has established cooperative 
and exchange relations in the field of maritime scientific 
research with more than 40 countries and regions in the world. 
<H5>  Breaking New Ground--Taking the Seas and Oceans as the Base </H5>
  The maritime development zones have brought considerable 
economic benefit to the coastal areas. In recent years, all 
coastal provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have 
formulated their own maritime development strategies and have 
found new economic growth points. Shandong's maritime 
industrial output value accounts for one-third of the national 
total. On the basis of "sea farming and aquaculture" in the 
past, the province has worked out its maritime economic 
development program and has planned to further develop new 
maritime industries. Hainan Province, the smallest province in 
the country, set forth the guideline of "using the seas to serve 
the province's development and building Hainan into a major 
maritime province." Guangxi has formulated its "Blue Plan," 
which has decided to turn Guangxi into a major maritime outlet 
for southwest China as a whole by speeding up maritime 
development. Guangdong has worked out a plan for developing 
maritime industries, especially the development of maritime 
mineral resources and island resources. Fujian Province has 
decided to develop an integrated maritime economy. Zhejiang has 
pointed out that hope for the province's economic growth is 
pinned on the seas and oceans and has worked out a comprehensive 
maritime development program. Shanghai, Hebei, Liaoning, and 
Jiangsu have all decided to advance their maritime industries. 
Jilin Province has no coastline, but it has decided to use the 
Tumen Jiang to seek maritime development. Beijing Municipality 
also has no coastline, but through making joint investments in 
harbor construction with Tangshan City, it will also gain access 
to the seas for its economic development. In conclusion, 
China's coastal areas are all vigorously developing their 
maritime industries. 
  The formation of new industries has provided a new driving 
force for socioeconomic growth, and this has been proved by the 
successful experience of many countries and regions in the 
1980's. China's rate of economic growth in recent years is 
attracting the world's attention, while the rate of growth of 
China's maritime industries has been more than double its rate 
of overall economic growth. In marching to the 21st century, 
China will also march into its "maritime century."

<F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Both Freight and Passenger Transportation </F>
Dipping"] 
  [Text] Transportation kept losing ground in November with 
freight volume dipping again after a short revival the previous 
month, according to the latest statistics from the State 
Statistics Bureau. 
  Freight transport volume in the first 11 months of 1993 
dropped by 0.1 percent over the corresponding 1992 period, a 
decrease from the 0.1 percent rise in the first 10 months of the 
year. However, the dip is smaller than the 0.2-percent drop in 
the first three quarters and a 0.3-percent shrink in the first 
eight months, a report from the bureau said. 
  Passenger transportation in the period, however, dropped by 
11 percent, representing a bigger decrease compared with the 
10.9- percent dip in the first 10 months and the 10-percent drop 
in the first nine months, the report said. 
  Freight transport volume stood at 2.515 billion tons in the 
first 11 months. 
  Of the total, rail freight inched up 2.2 percent to 1.43 
billion tons, while truck freight fell 8.4 percent to 505 
million tons. 
  Freight by boat climbed by 2.5 percent to 579 million tons, 
while air freight soared 21.6 percent to 633,000 tons. 
  Freight turnover in the January to November period--an 
important indicator in monitoring unit labour productivity and 
economic efficiency--witnessed a limited increase of 2.3 percent 
to 2.3 trillion ton-kilometres (One ton-kilometre is one ton of 
cargo transported one kilometre.) Of the total, railways 
reported a 2.9- percent rise to 1.08 trillion ton-kilometres, 
while truck freight turnover fell 16 percent to 27.766 billion 
ton-kilometres. 
  Air freight turnover generated 1.569 billion ton-kilometres, 
up 20.2 percent, and boat freight turnover climbed 2.1 percent 
to 1.2 trillion ton-kilometres. 
  Total passenger volume stood at 4.576 billion in the first 
11 
months, the report said. 
  Volume breakdown shows 962 million people travelled by rail, 
up 6.1 percent, while 3.422 billion travelled by buses, down 
15.2 percent. 
  Some 161 million people travelled by boat, down 8.1 percent, 
while 31.2 million people flew, up 17.6 percent. 
  The passenger turnover in the first 11 months reported a 
0.8- 
percent growth to 511.421 billion person-kilometres. 
  Of the total, passenger turnover by rail went up 11 percent 
to 320.888 billion person-kilometres, while bus travel turnover 
dived by 13.6 percent to 174.021 billion person-kilometres. 
  Boat travel turnover slid 2.5 percent to 16.508 billion 
person- kilometres with air travel chalking up 20.2 percent to 
42.981 billion person-kilometres. 
  In November alone, China's railways transported 125 million 
tons of freight and 84 million passengers.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Bid to Drill for Oil on Continental </F>
Shelf"] 
  [Text] China has launched a major effort to drill for oil 
on its continental shelf. 
  China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which oversees 
the country's onshore oil exploration and development, is 
expected to pump 1 million tons of oil in the shallow waters 
along the country's coastline in 1994. 
  Reports say exploration in offshore areas where the water is 
no deeper than 5 metres has made considerable progress. 
  In China, exploration and development in offshore areas 
where 
the waters are deeper than 5 metres are conducted by another oil 
firm -- China National Offshore Oil Corporation. 
  Three large onshore oilfields, whose oil deposits stretch 
into the continental shelf, have been explored for two years. 
  However, development of oil there had not begun until 
recently when a platform passed state appraisal at Shengli Oil 
Field, the country's second-largest oil field. 
  The platform, named Development No 1, passed the appraisals 
after 16 months' trial operation. This marked the official 
beginning of oil development in the continental shelf, according 
to oil industry officials. 
  The platform, which can be moved by a vessel or be seated on 
muddy or sandy seabeds, has the structure and necessary 
facilities to resist earthquakes, strong winds, and tidal waves. 
  The first one of its kind in China, the design of the 
platform was one of the key technological projects listed in the 
Eighth Five- Year Plan that ends in 1995. 
  With it, Shengli Oil Field has developed three oil wells and 
produced more than 8,000 tons of oil. 
  Before that, Shengli Oil Field had explored areas in the 
shallow waters for about two years. 
  A news release from CNPC last week revealed another movable 
platform for oil development in shallow waters was ready for use 
at Shengli. 
  The platform, named Development No 2, which was completed at 
the end of November, will be used in areas where water is 1.5 to 
9 metres deep. 
  The platform, equipped with facilities to generate 
electricity and treat oil-contaminated water, can be used to 
develop three oil wells at one time. 
  It can also gather and transmit data on winds and sea waves. 
  The release says the platform, now in trial use, is to be 
ready for state appraisal within months. 
  Development in the shallow waters is important for old oil 
fields, where stable production in onshore areas has become 
difficult after decades of exploitation. 
  Another two oil fields at Liaohe and Dagang are also being 
studied to find ways to develop oil deposits in shallow waters. 
  The official from CNPC revealed that the corporation will 
seek preferential policies from the government to encourage oil 
fields to develop the continental shelf. 
  When the policies are applied oil fields will be allowed to 
sell oil developed in the shallow waters at market prices. 
  Chinese onshore oil fields produce some 138 million tons of 
oil a year but most of the oil is priced low and distributed by 
the government.

<F P=106> [By Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "Volume of Natural Gas </F>
Reserves Proven in Past Three Years Exceeds Total in Previous 40 
Years"] 
  [Text] The construction of China's largest ever natural 
gas field, the Yinggehai Ya-13-1 gas field, has already started. 
By 18 December, nearly 50 km of underwater pipe line had been 
laid. Meanwhile, a second long-distance natural gas pipe line 
running from the North China oil field to supply gas to Beijing 
was put into use in late November after just one test operation. 
This pipe line's has been raised to 400,000 cubic meters a day. 
This evidence vividly reflects a series of major achievements 
by China in the development of natural gas prospecting as part 
of the oil industry since the start of the "Seven Five-Year 
Plan." A boom in China's natural gas reserves is arriving, said 
Wang Tao, general manager of China National Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Corporation, at an advanced symposium on the oil 
industry held in Beijing recently. 
  Over the past three years, according to the principle of 
"developing oil and natural gas alongside," the inland oil 
industry sector has been stepping up geological theoretical 
study and prospecting related to natural gas. Major prospecting 
findings have preliminarily revealed three new, large gas 
producing zones in inland China: 1) the northern Shaanxi gas 
field, the largest undivided single inland gas field ever 
discovered in China, covering a total area of more than 2,340 
square km; 2) eastern Sichuan, where a number of industrial gas 
fields have been discovered, and central and southwest Sichuan, 
where a number of gas wells have been drilled and have proven to 
be rich in gas; and 3) the Turpan-Hami Basin, Junggar Basin, and 
Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, with preliminarily proven gas reserves 
totaling nearly 100 billion cubic meters. In addition, another 
area rich in natural gas has been spotted and confirmed in the 
eastern Qaidam Basin, Qinghai. With major prospecting projects 
being launched in the above areas over the next seven years, 
China's proven reserves natural gas reserves proven are expected 
to increase by more than double. 
  China National Offshore Oil Corporation, now with 140 
billion 
cubic meters of gas reserves in hand, is running prospecting 
projects in the Yinggehai-Southeast Hainan region, which has 
been identified as the corporation's major natural gas 
prospecting operation zone. The corporation has drilled three 
test wells on its own this year, and will drill another six next 
year. Meanwhile, three oil and gas fields and four oil bearing 
structures have been discovered and confirmed in the East China 
Sea, and exploratory work has now begun. China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation is planning to produce 4 billion cubic 
meters of natural gas by 1997, and to obtain proven gas reserves 
totaling 400 billion cubic meters and an annual production 
capacity of 20 billion cubic meters of gas by the turn of the 
century. 
  Our country's proven natural gas reserves, newly discovered 
in the last three years, have surpassed the total amount 
discovered and proven over the previous four decades. 
Therefore, China is now ready to speed up exploration for 
resources.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 4 (XINHUA) -- The Baoshan Iron and 
Steel Plant in Shanghai, the most modern steel producer in 
China, has beaten its 1993 production targets, according to 
latest statistics. 
  In 1993, Baoshan produced 7.22 million tons of steel, an 
increase of 7.55 percent over the previous year, and 6.57 
million tons of iron, an increase of 5.47 percent over the 
previous year. 
  It reported a sales volume of 17.5 billion yuan and its 
profits and taxes grew by 110 percent. 
  According to its officials, the plant plans to produce 7.5 
million tons of steel in 1994 and products of high added value 
will account for one-third of the total output.

  [Text] Shengyang, January 4 (XINHUA) -- China has become 
the first country in the world to use coking gas as power in 
making sponge iron, a major material for high-grade alloy steel. 
  The scientific breakthrough, scored by the Benxi Iron and 
Steel Company in northeast China's Liaoning Province, is claimed 
to have reduced the contents of phosphorus, sulphur and carbon, 
all detrimental to the quality of steel, to far below the 
international standards. 
  Sponge iron is an important material for various high-grade 
alloy steel used in military, aerospace, petrochemical and other 
key industries. 
  Currently sponge iron production worldwide is powered by 
either natural gas or coal, a method characterized by 
complicated techniques and high costs. 
  According to specialists at the benxi iron and steel 
company, 
the new method is simpler and costs less. 
  The specialists also discovered that the iron ore in a local 
open mine has a very low content of phosphorus, sulphur and 
other harmful elements, and therefore is the best raw material 
for the production of good quality sponge iron.

  [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- Geological 
prospecting in China scored big achievements in 1993, an 
official from the ministry of geology and minerals said today. 
  According to the official, experts have appraised various 
geological structures of 18 blocks in the northern Tarim basin 
and 19 geological formations which could be oil-bearing. 
  He said that since the late 1960s, geologists have been 
wondering whether there are oil deposits in China's paleozoic 
marine strata. But this question has been resolved with 
discovery in the past nine years of 14 oil and natural gas 
fields in the Tarim basin. 
  In the East China Sea, too, high-yield wells began to work, 
with a single well yielding a daily output of up to 650 cubic 
meters of crude oil and some 227,000 cubic meters of natural gas. 
  Geologists found six promising geological formations during 
a 
geophysical investigation in the South China Sea. Well-drilling 
will start next year, according to the official. 
  In Tibet's Yangbajain area abounding in geothermal water 
resources, China found its hottest well with a top temperature 
of 262.03 degrees centigrade at its deepest point. At present, 
the yangbajain geothermal power station provides Lhasa, capital 
of Tibet, with 40 percent of its electricity supply. 
  For mineral prospecting, the official disclosed, 89 key 
mineral deposits have been discovered and some 20 minerals' 
reserves have proved much greater than expected, including 
manganese, copper, bauxite, gold and silver.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xie Yicheng: "Mining Firms Will Face New </F>
Levy"] 
  [Text] China is to impose a new mineral resources fee, 
similar to royalties in foreign countries and dubbed a 
compensation fee by officials, on all mining businesses starting 
this year. 
  Under the Chinese constitution, all mineral resources belong 
to the State. 
  The fee will be levied on all 9,000 State and 250,000 
collective mining enterprises as well as foreign-funded and 
private mining operators. 
  Each mining business will have to pay an average of less 
than 
4 percent of its sales income from mineral products as a fee. 
  Such a ratio, far lower than royalties abroad, treat foreign 
investors the same as domestic firms, according to Fu Mingke, 
deputy head of Mineral Development Management Bureau. 
  The bulk of the levy will be channelled to geological 
surveys 
and exploration work that are now stymied by a severe lack of 
investment, said a senior official with the Ministry of Geology 
and Mineral Resources. 
  The remainder will flow into general State revenue. 
  About 2-3 billion yuan ($230-344 million) a year is expected 
to be raised from the levy. 
  The State Council is reviewing detailed rules on the levy 
presented by the ministry, said Fu. 
  "The levy measures will come into force in the first half of 
this year," Fu said. He did not give a specific date. 
  The levy is aimed to help develop the State's economic 
resources. 
  The government's annual spending on geological surveys and 
exploration work is about 8 billion yuan ($919 million), far 
below what is needed to detect new mineral deposits and 
guarantee stable mining production. 
  In China, about 95 per cent of the energy and 80 percent of 
industrial raw materials come from non-renewable mineral 
resources. 
  The rules favour those with a higher mining recovery rate. 
They will be charged less to inspire more efficient and 
rational mining development. 
  Presently, enterprises and individuals which exploit 
minerals 
only pay small part of their income in resource tax. Many 
enterprises and individuals exploit mineral resources with 
inefficient mining practices or methods which damage the 
environment. This causes severe waste and loss of precious 
resources. 
  "The new measures are in line with the international norms," 
Fu said adding that almost all foreign countries charge mining 
firms a royalty. 
  The ministry prepared a draft of the rules in 1987, but met 
strong protest from mining firms allegedly unable to bear the 
financial burden owing to low State prices or mineral products. 
  "The time is ripe now. China's market economy has freed up 
the price of most minerals, including oil, coal and iron," Fu 
said. 
  Another consideration is that overseas investors involved in 
Chinese mines -- once an area forbidden to them -- should be 
charged with the fee.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sun Shangwu: "WB Loans Strengthen </F>
Efforts in Forestry"] 
  [Text] A $300 million World Bank loan has helped modernize 
China's forestry sector since it was granted in 1990, said a 
senior official from the Ministry of Forestry in a recent 
interview. 
  The loan, given to China's National Afforestation Project, 
will assist the country through 1997. 
  About 25 percent of it goes toward expanding national 
forests 
and the rest to developing collective woodlands. 
  In the past three years, China has used $180 million of the 
loan to afforest 900,000 hectares, said Qu Shuye, head of the 
World Bank Loan Projects Management Centre under the Ministry of 
Forestry. 
  When the project is completed, Qu said, it will boost the 
country's timber output by 300 million cubic metres, helping to 
ease the country's lumber shortage. 
  Loan money has gone to 16 provinces and autonomous regions, 
most in South and East China, including Guangdong, Guangxi, 
Hainan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Shandong. 
  As part of the project, a computer network has been set up 
to 
link forestry centres nationwide, allowing officials to 
co-ordinate efforts across the country and solve problems 
immediately with regular feedback. 
  Qu said an ecological monitoring system has also been set up 
to make sure that excessive planting does not lead to soil 
erosion. 
  He added that the World Bank's loan has not only helped 
afforestation efforts, but has helped bring new concepts and 
technology to the forestry sector. 
  Forestry officials have hammered out a scientific 
afforestation research plan. 
  More than 80 specialists worked on the plan, which Qu called 
"unprecedented." 
  To supervise the loan, the country has set up a system that 
links the use of money with planting results, the senior 
official said. 
  The World Bank is to grant another $200 million loan this 
year to the Forestry Resources Development and Protection 
Project, which will cover the intensive farming of artificial 
forests, the building of multipurpose shelter-belts and the 
improvement of management of nature reserves, Qu said.

  [Text] Hefei, January 5 (XINHUA) -- The work of taming the 
troublesome Huaihe River has been going smoothly in east China's 
Anhui Province over the past two years. 
  Official sources said that in 1993 the province poured some 
310 million yuan (about 35.6 million U.S. dollars) into the work 
of flood control on the Huaihe. About 28.7 million cu m [cubic 
meters] of earthworks was completed in the same year. 
  According to official statistics, by the end of 1992 some 
637 
million yuan (about 73.2 million U.S. dollars) had been used in 
the work, of which 120 million yuan (about 13.8 million U.S. 
dollars) was collected within the province. 
  Meanwhile, some 80 million cu m of earthworks had been 
completed. 
  Officials from the provincial government said that in 1993, 
100,000 workers were engaged in the task, as against 300,000 in 
1990 because of the increased use of machinery. 
  Located on the middle reaches of the Huaihe River, the 
province, most of whose land is lower than the high-water level 
of the river, has suffered from flood disasters throughout 
history. 
  In 1991, after suffering a particularly serious flood 
disaster, the province formulated a set of policies for 
combating the menace. 
  During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) China has 
listed 
13 projects concerning flood control work in Anhui Province as 
state key projects, with a total investment of some three 
billion yuan (about 345 million U.S. dollars). 
  In the meantime, the province plans to allocate some one 
billion yuan (about 115 million U.S. dollars) to support the 
projects. 
  In addition, the state government has earmarked some 100 
million yuan (about 11.5 million U.S. dollars) since 1991 for 
the construction of roads and temporary shelters in case of 
further flood disasters.

  [Text] Singapore, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
Premier Lien Chan began his second full day of visit in 
Singapore Tuesday [4 January] by golfing with Singaporean Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong and other officials. 
  Before the round of golf, Lien had breakfast with Goh, Trade 
and Commerce Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, and Environment Minister 
Mah Bon Tan, during which they discussed joint development 
projects on Mainland China's Hainan Province. 
  Lien said that petroleum and minerals would be the main 
products worth developing on Hainan, and suggested that Taiwan 
and Singapore establish a company financed by Taiwan and manned 
by Singaporeans to process and export the products. 
  Goh and other Singaporean officials expressed interest in 
the 
proposal, and Lien asked Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the 
Council for Economic Planning and Development, to keep in touch 
with the Singaporean side on the matter. 
  Lien arrived in Singapore Sunday for a four-day visit 
following his private visit in Malaysia. 
  Lien attended a dinner party hosted by President Ong Teng 
Cheong Monday night, and will attend one given by Senior 
Minister Li Kuan Yew Tuesday night. 
  Also attending the dinner Monday were Deputy Minister Lee 
Hsieng Loong, Foreign [as received] Affairs Minister Jayakumar 
Shunmugam, Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, Labor 
Minister Lim Boon Heng, Information and the Arts Minister Ker 
Sin Tze, and Singapore Trade Representative in Taipei Chai Chong 
Yi. 
  During his stay in Singapore, Lien has met with nearly every 
cabinet official, and this will help boost substantial relations 
between the two countries, observers said. 
  Lien's mission is comprised of Hsiao, Deputy Foreign Affairs 
Minister Fang Chin-yen, and Jason Hu, director-general of the 
Government Information Office. 
  Hsiao said Lien admired the public works, purchasing system, 
rapid transit network and financial services sector in 
Singapore, and was impressed by Malaysia's rapid economic 
development. 
  Lien's mission will return to Taipei Wednesday.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese legal experts 
pointed out here today that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's 
recent allegations against the mainland of China are completely 
groundless and slanderous. 
  On December 27, 1993, the spokesman for the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (HKMAOSC) stated that 
the British-Hong Kong three-tier political structures, namely 
the Legislative Council, district boards and two municipal 
councils of Hong Kong, should be disbanded upon the termination 
of British rule over Hong Kong on June 30, 1997. 
  At a press conference held two days later, Hong Kong 
Governor 
Chris Patten accused the HKMAOSC of having pre-empted the right 
of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee to 
interpret the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, saying that HKMAOSC's statement violated the Basic Law 
itself, for instance, the article 160. 
  Experts who took part in drafting the Basic Law pointed out 
that it is certainly the NPC Standing Committee's right to 
interpret the Basic Law, and this is defined in the Basic Law. 
  However, they argued, the spokesman of the HKMAOSC was only 
reiterating the contents defined clearly in the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and was not executing the 
right to interpret the Basic Law. 
  The experts pointed out that both the forward of the Basic 
Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulated clearly 
that the government of the People's Republic of China will 
resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 
1997 and Britain will terminate its rule over Hong Kong. With 
the termination of British rule, the British political 
structures in Hong Kong will also be terminated and disbanded. 
Why should it be necessary to interpret this again? they asked. 
  Xiao Weiyun, professor of the department of law of Beijing 
University, stressed that it is the internal affair of China and 
within state sovereignty to decide which institutions and 
organizations should be retained and which ones should be 
abolished according to the concrete situation and the principle 
of the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Chris 
Patten has no right to make indiscreet remarks on this. 
  Professor Xiao, who took part in the whole process of 
drafting the Basic Law, recalled that the Chinese government has 
tried to follow the principle of keeping the social and economic 
systems and the people's living style in Hong Kong unchanged and 
making as little change as possible in the legal and political 
systems of Hong Kong. This is aimed at maintaining the 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and ensuring a smooth 
transition of the city. These are precisely the wishes of the 
compatriots in Hong Kong. 
  With this purpose, Professor Xiao said, the Chinese 
government has done its utmost to work sincerely during the 
Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95 
elections. However, Chris Patten unilaterally decided to 
gazette the electoral bill and submit it to the Legislative 
Council before any agreement was reached between the British and 
Chinese sides in their talks, thus completely destroying the 
basis of further Sino-British cooperation on the issue. 
  Under such urgent and complicated circumstances, Professor 
Xiao pointed out, the HKMAOSC spokesman made the above mentioned 
statement. The statement showed the firm attitude of the 
Chinese government toward the Hong Kong issue and reiterated and 
safeguarded the spirit of the Basic Law rather than violation of 
the law. 
  Article 160 of the Basic Law reads: "Upon the establishment 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region, the laws 
previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as laws of the 
region except for those which the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress declares to be in contravention of 
this law. If any laws are later discovered to be in 
contravention of this law, they shall be amended or cease to 
have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by 
this law. Documents, certificates, contracts, and rights and 
obligations valid under the laws previously in force in Hong 
Kong shall continue to be valid and be recognized and protected 
by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, provided that 
they do not contravene this law." 
  Some experts pointed out that article 160 talks about the 
issue of law while the HKMAOSC spokesman was talking about the 
issue of state sovereignty and the termination of British rule 
over Hong Kong. The British-Hong Kong authorities have no right 
to extend their political structures into the period after 1997. 
  The experts noted that what Chris Patten said was beside the 
point, which showed that Mr. Patten is ignorant about the basic 
law. 
  The experts pointed out that it is the British-Hong Kong 
authorities that have made improper interpretation of the Basic 
Law. For example, they have demanded that the formation of the 
preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Committee should be the result of Sino-British consultation and 
that China should promise to adopt universal suffrage in 
election of the Hong Kong Legislative Council in 2007. 
Actually, these will all be the internal affairs of China and 
are no business of Chris Patten. Many people have advised the 
last governor of Hong Kong to read the Basic Law more carefully 
so as to make fewer funny mistakes.

  [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. Senate 
delegation led by its Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
Chairman Bennett Johnston arrived in Beijing this morning to 
start a five-day tour of China. 
  Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese Institute of Foreign 
Affairs (CIFA), held a working meeting with the delegation this 
afternoon, during which the two sides exchanged views on the 
improvement and development of Sino-U.S. bilateral relations. 
  The current visit is designed to explore the prospects of 
expanding trade and co-operation in the field of energy, and 
exchanging views on a variety of issues such as trade in 
military products, nuclear proliferation and issues related to 
China's most- favored-nation status. 
  As CIFA's guest, the delegation is a continuation of a 
series 
of visits by groups of U.S. Senators who have toured China since 
last August, and is the first delegation to visit China since 
the Sino- U.S. summit in Seattle between Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, a CIFA official said. 
  Among the delegation are seven Senators, including the 
Senate's minority leader, Alan Simpson. 
  The delegation is the biggest yet to visit China from the 
U.S. Senate, the official said, and senior Chinese leaders will 
meet it before it leaves for Guangzhou, the capital of south 
China's Guangdong Province.

<F P=106> ["Notes on Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 </F>
0393): "Marking `Mao's Birth' Amid Cries of Reproach"] 
  [Text] With the approach of 26 December, the contradiction 
between respecting and degrading Mao will become more pronounced 
both within and outside the CPC. The top CPC leaders view the 
use of "Mao's birth" to negate Deng Xiaoping's theory and line 
as a "left" deviation and the total negation of Mao Zedong as a 
"right" deviation. They have sensed that the resurgence of 
"leftism" is very terrible. Therefore, while marking the 100th 
anniversary of Mao's birth, they want to limit the scope of the 
activities. 
<H5>  The Contradiction Between Respecting and Degrading Mao </H5>
  On 13 December, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat held a 
teleconference of party and government leading cadres of 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, at which Hu 
Jintao delivered a speech and conveyed the central instruction 
on activities recently carried out by local authorities to mark 
the centenary of the birth of Mao Zedong. The instruction says: 
We must undertake commemorative activities in strict accordance 
with the requirements set out by the Propaganda Department of 
the CPC Central Committee, rather than on a large scale. We 
must not debate the appraisal of Mao Zedong. We must not force 
others to undertake such activities and must not urge 
prefectures, cities, enterprises, democratic parties or 
organizations to do so. We must do a good job in the current 
central work and tasks, and must study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The 
Central Committee urged preventing and checking both "left" and 
right deviations making use of activities in some localities and 
departments to stage a resurgence, as well as a guard against 
negating the basic appraisal of and conclusion on Mao Zedong 
which were made at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC 
Central Committee. 
  The remark "not debating" laid bare the contradiction 
between 
respecting and degrading Mao, and the awkward predicament in 
which the CPC decisionmaking body found itself. 
<H3>  Hu Jintao: Prevent a Handful of People From Whipping Up the 
"Leftist" Ideological Trend </H3>
  At the conference, Hu Jintao pointed out the acuteness of 
the 
contradiction when he said: In some localities and departments, 
debates on the appraisal of Mao Zedong and the understanding of 
Mao Zedong Thought have caused work delays and even clashes at 
meetings. He urged promptly correcting this abnormal, 
disorganized anarchy and lack of discipline, and preventing a 
handful of people in one or two departments from using 
activities marking the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth to whip 
up the "leftist" ideological trend, and to attack and negate 
reform and opening up to the outside world, the party's central 
work, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. 
  The "clashes at meetings" mentioned by Hu Jintao referred to 
brutally attacking each other by banging on tables. This state 
of affairs is rarely seen in regular activities or at other 
meetings of CPC organizations. This being the case, Hu Jintao 
-- in all seriousness -- termed the state of affairs "abnormal, 
disorganized anarchy and lack of disciple." This remark was 
also an embodiment of Deng Xiaoping's idea of "guarding against 
rightism, but mainly preventing `leftism.'" 
<H3>  Those Who Want To Restore the "Leftist" Line Will Be Removed 
From Office </H3>
  As for as those who want to use activities marking "Mao's 
birth" to restore the "leftist," line the CPC decisionmaking 
body will resort to wielding the killer mace -- dismissal from 
office -- against them. 
  At the conference, Hu Jintao said: Party committees and 
governments at all levels must have a firm grasp of leadership 
and the initiative, pay close attention to the current central 
work, and prevent and criticize the handful of people attempting 
to divert the orientation of this work. Those who refuse to 
correct their mistakes after being helped must quit their 
leading positions and the party. 
  Those who capitalize on "Mao's birth" in order to inflame 
and 
agitate people constitute a "tiny minority of people." Most 
party- member cadres -- particularly those who greatly suffered 
during the Great Cultural Revolution -- either showed 
indifference or had an extremely strong aversion to "Mao's 
birth." 
<H5>  Marking "Mao's Birth" Is Regarded as a Task </H5>
  According to restricted XINHUA news reports, most central 
departments, commissions, and offices regarded conducting 
activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth as a 
task. The meetings, report meetings, and forums marking the 
occasion were very dull and spiritless, with more than 30 
percent of the expected participants requesting leave. At the 
report meetings sponsored by central organs to commemorate the 
centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, some veteran comrades raised 
objections and said the commemoration was "inappropriate in 
timing and not in keeping with the common aspirations of the 
party and the people." Still other veteran comrades denounced 
the errors committed by Mao Zedong during his final years and 
the catastrophe brought about by the Great Cultural Revolution. 
Some excessively fierce clashes between people with differing 
views took place at some meetings. 
  These phenomena could be found among both the central and 
local authorities. 
<H3>  Restricted News Reports Show Local Authorities' Resistance 
to Commemorating "Mao's Birth" </H3>
  According to restricted XINHUA news reports on 15 and 16 
December, among the activities sponsored by local authorities to 
mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, the following 
phenomena could be found almost everywhere. 
  1. Local party and government leaders regarded conducting 
activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth as a task 
assigned from the higher authorities; in most cases, local party 
and government organizations carried the activities only 
perfunctorily. 
  2. In doing their work, propaganda departments found 
themselves under great pressure. They were afraid both of 
evoking repercussions among their subordinates by exceeding the 
central commemoration requirements and of not attaining the 
goals of the commemoration activities. 
  3. Organization departments were passive in their work. 
Most cadres, party members, and activists were unenthusiastic, 
and some remained unconvinced as to the purpose of all the 
activities. 
  4. Grass-roots party organizations and some party committees 
stated openly that they did not want to carry out the 
commemoration activities for fear that the "leftist" ideological 
trend would spread again, that the activities would hamper their 
work, and that they would serve as a blow to the feelings of 
middle-aged and elderly intellectuals. 
  5. The community was interested in Mao Zedong's life, style, 
and related stories, which had a relatively great impact. Some 
people did not understand why the Communists -- who did not 
believe in gods or heresy -- could praise and commemorate 
someone as a god. 
  It is not difficult to understand why local cadres have 
defiant feelings to the commemoration of "Mao's birth." They 
all are afraid of the resurgence of "leftism" because their 
interests would be greatly harmed should the disaster of 
"leftism" befall the country again. This situation merits 
attention. 
<H3>  Peng Zhen: Do Not Provoke the People To Review the Bitter 
Experiences of the Mao Years </H3>
  It has been reported that in early December 1993, Peng Zhen 
made another speech on the commemoration of centenary of Mao 
Zedong's birth. He urged stressing on appropriateness, realism, 
paying attention to reactions from within both the party and 
society, and refraining from provoking the people to review the 
bitter experiences of the Mao years. 
<H3>  Some Eighty Research Fellows Urged the Central Committee To 
Guard Against "Leftism" </H3>
  More than 80 research fellows at the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences wrote a letter to Jiang Zemin and the party 
Central Committee to urge preventing Mao Zedong's "leftist" 
ideological trend disrupting the current central work and 
undermining the confidence and rallying force of the broad 
masses of people for carrying out the four modernizations in the 
spirit of seeking truth from facts, and that history, as well as 
the will of the majority of people inside and outside the party, 
be respected. 
<H3>  The Voice Opposing the Commemoration of "Mao's Birth" Is 
Building Up </H3>
  At the third plenary session discussions, the party 
committees of Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, 
Guangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shandong, Anhui, 
Xinjiang, Qinghai, Fujian, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia 
reported to the Central Committee that in society there were 
strong voices opposed to commemorating the centenary of Mao 
Zedong's birth. More than 17 celebrities in Shanghai and 
Beijing stated that they would go on a hunger strike on 26 
December to protest the commemoration. 
<H3>  Two Hunan Teachers Kill Themselves To Protest "Mao's Birth" 
Commemorative Activities </H3>
  Unexpectedly, there actually were people who killed 
themselves to protest the commemoration of "Mao's birth." This 
hearsay came from Mao's birthplace: Hunan. 
  Since the beginning of 1993, two middle school teachers from 
Hengyang and Xiangtan cities in Hunan had written 10 or more 
letters to the CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang 
Zemin, and the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee, calling for a 
halt to nationwide activities marking the centenary of Mao 
Zedong's birth or at least for carrying out the activities in a 
low-key manner. They said the activities should be carried out 
in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation. 
  In August, during the summer holidays, with the signatures 
of 
nearly 30 university and middle school teachers, the two 
teachers asked to go to Beijing to make their demands known. A 
deputy director of the Complaints Bureau of the State Council 
said: We understand your wishes, but the matter must be decided 
by the Central Committee. The Hunan Provincial CPC Committee 
criticized the two teachers and warned them against being used 
and against creating chaos. 
  It has been reported that the two teachers wrote a letter to 
Deng Xiaoping entitled "Comrade Xiaoping, People Are Longing for 
Your Decision" and a letter to Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central 
Committee entitled "To Make Fresh Contributions to the People, 
It Is Imperative To Thoroughly Criticize Mao." Time and again, 
the two teachers' demands and protests were rejected, distorted, 
and shelved the moment they were submitted. In despair, the two 
teachers committed suicide by throwing themselves into the Xiang 
Jiang on 26 November. The Hunan Provincial Government accused 
them of being "distraught." 
  The emergence of activities to mark "Mao's birth" and 
related 
events has proved that the root of "leftism" is still with the 
CPC, the disaster of "leftism" has not been eradicated, and the 
soul of "leftism" still haunts Zhongnanhai.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- China will continue 
to take effective measures to stabilize commodity prices, 
especially the prices of grain and edible oil, a leading 
official from the State Planning Committee said here today. 
  The rise of grain and edible oil prices since November last 
year has been brought under control, he said, and the prices of 
these commodities in the markets throughout China are stable as 
a series of measures have been taken by governments at all 
levels. 
  At present, most of the state-owned grain shops sell grain 
at 
marked prices with unlimited supply, the official said, adding 
that in some areas the prices of grain and edible oil have 
dropped. 
  China will continue to strengthen the management of the 
markets and control and supervision of the prices, he said. 
  "Those who seek exorbitant profits through driving up prices 
will be punished severely," he said. 
  He mentioned that a series of reform plans involving taxes, 
finance and investment will come out this year. "The government 
will take effective measures to soften the negative impacts of 
these plans on society," he stressed. 
  In addition, measures such as increasing salaries, and 
subsidies and incomes of farmers will be taken. 
  Meanwhile, China will spare no efforts to develop its 
economy 
to guarantee supply, the official said. 
  The state reserves of grain in 1994 will be sufficient, 
while 
the supply of edible oil, sugar and some articles of everyday 
use will meet the demand. 
  "China has the conditions to keep prices low and markets 
stable," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 2 (XINHUA) -- China's 
ship-building industry produced 30 percent more in 1993 than the 
previous year. 
  The total tonnage built in the year was 1.3 million. 
  Wang Rongsheng, president of the China State Shipbuilding 
Corporation, in giving these figures said that half of the ships 
built last year were exported. 
  China's annual ship-building capacity is expected to be 
doubled by the turn of the century, he added. 
  The industry will seize every opportunity to quicken the 
pace 
of international cooperation and to promote ship-building to 
take part in competition in the market, in order to meet an 
increasing need for ships worldwide, he said. 
  Wang said that key projects for the five major shipyards' 
expansion, including the Jiangnan and Guangzhou Shipyards, will 
be completed this year. 
  He added that a 200,000-dwt [deadweight tons] dock at the 
Dalian Shipyard and several other 100,000 dwt docks or piers 
will also start construction in the new year. 
  He also said that China's efforts in the ship industry have 
been focused for the past 15 years on the import of advanced 
technology, the expansion of ship-producing capacity, and the 
export of more ships. 
  He said that the orders which China has received for new 
ships now ranked among the biggest in the world.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- The incumbent 
employees of the Hong Kong Government do not need to worry about 
their jobs after 1997, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said 
here today. 
  Spokesman Wu Jianmin reiterated this position at a weekly 
press conference here this afternoon, when asked to comment on 
reports about worries some incumbent Hong Kong Government 
employees have about their status after 1997. 
  "As stipulated by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Adminitrative Region, Hong Kong Government employees working in 
all departments before the establishment of the Special 
Administrative Region, shall retain their jobs, their seniority 
shall be preserved, and the standard for their salaries, 
subsidies, fringe benefits and service conditions shall not be 
lower than before," Wu noted. 
  "Therefore, it is needless to have any worry in this 
connection," Wu said. 
  On Sino-British talks on Hong Kong, Wu said that China has 
made it clear to the British side that if the British side 
sincerely hoped for the restoration of the talks, it should 
withdraw the partial political reform package from the 
Legislative Council. 
  "The British side should have been more than clear about 
this 
position of the Chinese side. Therefore, one can say that the 
entire responsibility for the termination of the negotiations 
rests fully on the British side," he said. 
  "The position of the Chinese side concerning the talks 
remains unchanged. The door to the talks stays open. But the 
key is the attitude of the British side. 
  "Without withdrawing what has been submitted, it is not 
possible to have the talks resumed," Wu stressed.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin pointed out today: The British side can 
prove its sincerity about wanting to resume the talks only when 
it withdraws the partial "political reform bill" which has 
already been submitted to the Legislative Council from the 
latter's examination and discussion. 
  At a routine news briefing this afternoon, a reporter asked: 
Now that the British Hong Kong Government has already ruled out 
the possibility of Chris Patten withdrawing the political reform 
bill at the request of the Chinese side, is it still likely that 
China and Britain will resume their talks in such a situation? 
Wu Jianmin made the aforementioned remarks when answering the 
question.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a news briefing this afternoon: 
China hopes to restore the Sino-French relations at the 
earliest possible date on the basis of the principles for 
establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. 
  When asked to comment on French Foreign Minister Juppe's 
recent reiteration on hoping to restore Sino-French relations as 
soon as possible, Wu Jianmin said: "We welcome the positive 
statement made by Foreign Minister Juppe. We have time and 
again made clear China's principled stand and positive attitude 
toward improving the Sino-French relations. We hope to restore 
and develop the Sino- French relations at the earliest possible 
date on the basis of the principles for establishing diplomatic 
relations between the two countries." 
  When asked to comment on the prospect that a new 
organization 
would be set up after the Paris-based Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] is disbanded in 
early April and it would invite China to join in, he said: The 
Cocom is a product of the Cold War and should have been 
abolished earlier. Any new organization to be established after 
the Cocom is disbanded should be conducive to the development of 
economic and trade ties, scientific and technological 
cooperation, and exchanges between nations.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 6 KYODO -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Thursday [6 January] called Sino-Japan relations "very 
good" and attached much importance to Japan's Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's upcoming visit to China. 
  "In 1993 Sino-Japanese trade reached a new historic level," 
Wu Jianmin said at his weekly news briefing. "Bilateral 
cooperation in all areas has been growing constantly and 
steadily, especially in the economic and trade fields where 
bilateral ties are maintaining strong momentum." 
  Wu said Hata's visit from January 8 to 9 will be the first 
high- level meeting between the two countries in 1994 and that 
China hopes the visit will "push forward" further developments. 
  Trade between the two countries is expected to have reached 
30 billion dollars in 1993, up from 25.3 billion dollars in 1992. 
  Hata will hold meetings with key leaders, including 
President 
Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. 
  Hata also will hold his fourth overall meeting with Qian.

  [Text] Washington, January 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was scheduled to embark on a visit to 
high- growth areas in Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand and 
China, later this month, the government said here today. 
  The visit, which will start "immediately" after the Moscow 
summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, is the first by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in a 
year. 
  Bentsen, speaking here today, said his visit was to follow 
up 
on the progress made in Seattle last November during the 
ministerial meeting and informal leaders' meeting of Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  "We must recognize that the United States has a substantial 
interest in the Pacific region," Bentsen said. "The Asia 
Pacific region today is the fastest growing economy in the world 
and we must be part of it." 
  The secretary said that his mission in the forthcoming tour 
was to finalize the APEC finance ministers' meeting scheduled 
this year, and was "about how each of us sees APEC as a vehicle 
to further growth and development." 
  Indonesia, with the fourth-largest population in the world, 
has an average real growth rate of six percent for the last 25 
years, while Thailand's gross domestic product has been over 
seven percent for the past seven years. 
  The economic growth of China was estimated at 13 percent 
last 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Listeners to China 
Radio International (CRI), China's overseas radio service, now 
number some 200 million around the world. 
  Sources at the radio station said that it received more than 
554,000 letters from listeners in 173 countries and regions 
around the globe in 1993, 225,000 more than in the previous year. 
  The station calculates that it receives one letter per 300 
to 
500 listeners. This makes it one of the three-largest radio 
stations in the world in terms of the number of listeners. 
  Inaugurated September 11, 1947, the radio station now 
broadcasts in 38 languages besides standard Chinese, and the 
Cantonese, Hakka, Xiamen and Chaozhou dialects. 
  So far, more than 2,000 CRI listeners clubs have been 
established in 45 countries and regions, according to the 
sources.

  [Text] Washington, January 5 (XINHUA) -- A senior U.S. 
official said here today that the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea (DPRK) has now agreed to accept an inspection of their 
seven declared nuclear sites. 
  "At the same time we have reason to believe that the North 
is 
prepared now to meet again with the South" in order to carry out 
the denuclearization agreement, said Lynn Davis, undersecretary 
of state for international security affairs, at a State 
Department news briefing. 
  Davis described the development as "very good news," saying 
a 
third round of discussions between the United States and the 
DPRK would take place after those two steps would have been 
taken. 
  The United States and the DPRK held two rounds of 
discussions 
separately in June and July last year and they also held five 
informal meetings last December in New York. 
  "So the most immediate step at this point is for the North 
Koreans to meet with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy 
Agency) and work out the details of those inspections of the 
seven declared sites," Davis said. 
  In the third round of discussions, Davis claimed, "we will 
be 
seeking to bring the North Koreans into full compliance with 
their obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty, including 
the requirement to receive inspections at the two non-declared 
nuclear sites." 
  For the United States, it will "find ways to resolve once 
and 
for all our outstanding issues with respect to the nuclear 
policies of North Korea," Davis added.

  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin reportedly has written to a prominent Communist in 
the new parliament to seek his cooperation. 
  He is Anatoliy Lukyanov, who once served as the president of 
the former Supreme Soviet of USSR and has been accused of being 
involved in the August 19 coup attempt in 1991. 
  Lukyanov was elected into Russia's new parliament "The State 
Duma" last December as a candidate of the Russian Communist 
Party. He failed to appear before the special military tribunal 
in recent trials for health reasons. 
  In his letter to Lukyanov, Yeltsin said that there exists a 
"possibility of fruitful cooperation" between them. 
  Yeltsin suggested that Lukyanov "share the responsibility 
for 
the destiny of the Russian Federation and its citizens" and 
offer his advice on the relationship between president and 
parliament. 
  The episode was revealed today when the military tribunal 
resumed the trial of the accused in the August 19 incident, 
Ostankino State Radio and Television Broadcasting Company 
reported. 
  Since Lukyanov was elected into the new parliament, the 
tribunal has received letters calling for his immunity from 
trials. 
  The tribunal rejected the appeals on the ground that there 
is 
no special provisions in the Constitution concerning the 
criminal immunity for members of parliament.

  [Text] Moscow, January 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian 
law-enforcement agencies have decided to create a special bureau 
to coordinate the fight against mounting organized crimes, 
especially in Moscow and the second largest city of St. 
Petersburg. 
  First deputy Interior Minister Colonel-General Mikhail 
Yegorov told an international seminar today that the bureau will 
include specialists from all members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and cooperate closely with police authorities 
in the United States, Germany, Italy and other nations. 
  Yegorov said that "full-blooded" units of this nature have 
already gone into action in all the regions of Russia. 
  He reported that 2.8 million crimes were committed in 1993 
in 
Russia. Although the overall growth is only about one percent 
over the previous year, he noted, serious crimes such as murders 
and offenses with the use of fire arms are rising faster. 
  Last year, 26,000 murder cases and 20,000 fire arms offences 
were reported. But Yegorov did not give comparable figures for 
the previous year. 
  Criminal gangs have controlled about 40,000 businesses and 
state organizations in the country and multiplied their assets 
in recent years with forged advice notes, drug-trafficking and 
car and weapon smuggling. 
  According to Yegorov, gangsters from various groups clash 
daily for "spheres of influence". 
  From 600 to 700 cases of racketeering, 10 to 15 cases of 
hostage- taking and 30 to 35 armed gang clashes were recorded 
each month, he said. 
  He stressed that with many hardened offenders freed from 
jail, the expertise of criminals has been increasing. There are 
a total of 400,000 inmates in Russian prisons.

  [Text] Moscow, January 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 20 
influential Russian newspapers have threatened to stop 
publishing for a week when the new parliament opens its first 
session and U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Russia. 
  The move, to be taken from January 11 to 17, is designed to 
protest against a November 25 government decree which increased 
the printing costs by five times. 
  The boycott was announced today at a press conference by 
editors- in-chief of these newspapers, including IZVESTIA, 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) [INDEPENDENT 
GAZETTE], TRUD and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, as well as weekly 
magazine MOSCOW NEWS. 
  Outraged by the government decision, press leaders had 
written to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on December 29, 
complaining that neither the newspapers nor their subscribers 
could afford the price hike. 
  Some editors-in-chief pointed out at the press conference 
that the government decision is essentially designed to 
suffocate the press. 
  Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian Press 
Association, 
said that they are forced to take the step. He added, however, 
that a final decision will be made according to the response 
from the government.

  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Russia has raised 
"vigilance" and "anxiety" over Lithuania's official request on 
Tuesday [4 January] for joining in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO). 
  The Russian Presidential Press Office issued a statement 
today, saying that President Boris Yeltsin was worried by the 
trend toward expanding the NATO bloc. 
  Such a trend contradicted the "declared intentions to build 
mutual relations on principles of trust, partnership and 
equilibrium," the statement said. 
  NATO's expansion by admitting Russia's neighbors will 
"provoke a negative response" and "contribute to the development 
of negative sentiments within civilian and military circles." 
  The statement added that Yeltsin believed that such a haste 
extension will in the long run "destabilize political and 
military situation" in the region. 
  Yeltsin expected that heads of NATO member states and the 
alliance will desert dual stances in dealing with those issues 
vital to the fate of the whole world and the interest of Russian 
people. 
  After disintegrations of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, 
some East European countries and members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States wanted to join in NATO to seek protection of 
security. But Russia strongly opposes these attempts, which, it 
says, is against Russia's interest.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Lian Gong (6647 0364): "Extensive Cooperation </F>
Helps Development of All Countries"] 
  [Text] On the evening of 24 December, Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the Beijing municipal party committee and honorary 
president of the municipal people's association for friendship 
with foreign countries, met with Wada Kazuo, president of 
Japan's Babaiban [name as transliterated] International 
Distribution Group, and Hashimoto Ikari, adviser to the group 
and former ambassador to China. 
  Chen Xitong extended a welcome to the Japanese friends and 
praised Mr. Hashimoto Ikari for his contributions to 
Sino-Japanese friendship when serving as the ambassador to 
China. He said: China and Japan are friendly neighbors, and 
their long-term friendly cooperation is conducive to the peace 
of Asia and the world. China's opening wider to the outside 
world, its economic development, and its greater cooperation 
with other countries will, instead of affecting its cooperation 
with Japan, help develop Sino- Japanese cooperation still 
better. China's development will not affect the development of 
other countries, and its effort to develop extensive cooperation 
will be helpful to the development of all countries. 
  During the meeting, Chen Xitong expressed congratulations 
and 
support to the establishment in Beijing the "Babaiban 
multi-national women's volleyball team," holding that sports 
will promote friendship. Both sides also discussed joint 
investment in establishing the "Beijing Babaiban International 
Material Exchange Center Company Limited." 
  Wada Kazuo said: I am very pleased to come to Beijing and 
find a very good cooperation partner. Chinese commodities are 
good and more of them will enter the world market. The Babaiban 
group wishes to sell more Chinese commodities. 
  Vice Mayor Lu Yucheng and others were present at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
said here today that it is his hope that his forthcoming visit 
to Germany, Switzerland and Austria will help promote the 
friendly ties and co-operation between China and those countries. 
  He made the remark at a meeting here this afternoon with the 
ambassadors of the three countries to China: German Ambassador 
Armin Freitag, Swiss Ambassador Dr. Erwin Schurtenberger and 
Austrian Ambassador Dr. Dietrich Bukowski. 
  Qiao is scheduled to pay an official goodwill visit to the 
three countries from January 16 to 30 at the invitation of the 
Presidium of the Bundestag of Germany, President Gert Haller of 
the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland and 
President Heinz Fischer of the National Council of Austria. 
  During the meeting, Qiao said he felt very pleased to have 
the chance to visit these three countries, adding, "though the 
visit will be paid in the winter season, I will go to the three 
countries full of enthusiasm. I am sure that I will be accorded 
a warm and friendly reception." 
  He said China and the three West European countries enjoy 
sound relationships in political, economic and other fields. 
"It is my aspiration that through the visits the mutual 
understanding and friendship will be further enhanced, and the 
relations between China and these three countries developed on 
the existing basis." 
  Qiao asked the ambassadors to convey his greetings and good 
wishes to the parliamentary and government leaders of the 
respective countries. 
  The three ambassadors shared the view that the relationship 
between China's NPC and the parliaments of the three countries 
is very good. Qiao's visit is bound to further promote this 
relationship and make a decisive contribution to state-to-state 
ties, they said. 
  Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, 
and 
Jiang Enzhu, vice minister of foreign affairs, took part in the 
meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan 6 (AFP)--Taiwan and China have agreed 
to hold high-level talks in Beijing at the end of this month, 
following three rounds of unsuccessful negotiations to resolve 
disputes, a spokesman said Thursday. 
  Shih Chi-ping, spokesman of the semi-official Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF), said: "Our vice chairman, Chiao 
Jen-ho, will have a five-day meeting with his mainland 
counterpart Tang Shubei in Beijing beginning January 31 to 
discuss the operation of our two organizations and other issues." 
  But Shih emphasized that the meeting was not intended to 
discuss disputes directly and would not address the thorny issue 
of repatriating Chinese hijackers to the mainland. The 
hijacking issue and fishing disputes were major obstacles to the 
successful conclusion of three previous rounds of talks between 
SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his mainland counterpart, 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) 
chairman Wang Daohan. The talks were bogged down on 
jurisdiction and sovereignty issues. The upcoming meeting is 
intended only to discuss the operations between the SEF and 
ARATS, Shih said. 
  But the spokesman said: "Mr. Chiao and Tang may exchange 
opinions on the hijackings and other general issues, which can 
help pave the way for the fourth round of talks in the future." 
  SEF officials said Chiao was expected to ask Tang to set 
aside sensitive political issues to facilitate progress in the 
next round of talks. He will also try to talk Tang into 
agreeing that each side had its own jurisdiction right in 
handling various cases, they added. 
  The spate of hijackings -- 10 occurred in 1993 -- have 
emerged as a new source of friction between Beijing and Taipei, 
rivals since the communist government swept to power on the 
mainland in 1949 following a civil war and forced it nationalist 
opposition to Taiwan. Taiwan maintains that it has the 
jurisdiction to try and imprison hijackers, but China refuses to 
recognize such a right and insists that they must be repatriated. 
  SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 as nominally private 
bodies 
to get around Taiwan's 44-year-old policy of no direct contact 
with Beijing. The chairmen of the two agencies held the 
first-ever talks in Singapore in April to find ways to improve 
cross strait ties and resolve certain disputes.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Li Kuo-chung (2621 </F>
0948 1813): "Lu Ping Reiterates That Laws on the Term of Hong 
Kong's Three-Tier Structure Will Be Nullified in 1997"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan--Lu Ping, director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, reiterated today: 
The laws on the term of the two municipal councils and the 
district boards, which are a component part of the Hong Kong 
political structure, must be nullified after 1997. Nobody has 
the right to stipulate that the three-tier councils can transit 
beyond 1997. The nullification of the relevant laws will be 
announced by the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee in the future. This is a policy of the Chinese 
Government. 
  In response to Chris Patten's remark that the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office's earlier statement ran counter to the 
Basic Law, Lu Ping said today: This is the policy of the 
Chinese Government because, although the district boards and the 
two municipal councils are not organs of power, they are a 
component part of the Hong Kong political structure. Therefore, 
the laws on the term of the three- tier structure, if they 
should go beyond 1997, will be null and void. Neither Chris 
Patten nor anybody else has the right to stipulate that the 
three-tier councils may go beyond 1997. All these laws will, of 
course, be null and void. This is the policy of the Chinese 
Government. He added: As to when the announcement will be made 
and what law and provisions will be declared null and void, of 
course, this will be made by the NPC Standing Committee. 
  Lu also asked Patten to study the Basic Law well. "If one 
does not study well, one has no right to speak. It is necessary 
to study the Basic Law well and see what it says. People can 
see at a glance who on earth is violating the Basic Law." 
  As to the draft regulations on the airport corporation which 
the Hong Kong Government has just made public, Lu said: It is 
fine that the draft regulations on the airport corporation have 
been published. The Chinese side has made clear its hope that 
the British Hong Kong authorities will publish the regulations 
at an early date to let the vast numbers of residents air their 
views. After soliciting views from the various quarters, the 
Chinese side will consult the British Hong Kong authorities. 
Therefore, the current discussion of this issue by the 
Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] is a channel through which the 
Chinese side solicits views. The Chinese side hopes that the PWC 
will discuss this issue first and put forward its views and then 
we will continue to discuss this issue with the British side. 
At the end of the day, this is something which should be 
discussed by the Chinese and British sides because the 
Memorandum of Understanding stipulates this. 
  Asked whether Sino-British consultations on the airport will 
promote cooperation in other fields, Lu Ping reiterated: The 
Chinese side has always hoped to cooperate with the British side 
but this is not a unilateral issue. It hopes the British side 
will genuinely cooperate in all fields. Recently, some PWC 
members said they hoped to have contact with British Hong Kong 
officials. It goes without saying this is a very ordinary 
affair but the British Hong Kong authorities have obviously 
adopted an uncooperative attitude, not allowing any officials to 
have contact with PWC members. 
  Lu Ping asked in reply: "What's wrong with contacts? We 
should have contacts. If one is cooperative, one should not be 
afraid. What is there to be afraid of?"

  [Text] The Government says it will reject any invitation 
from the Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] to send officials 
to Beijing to answer questions about the new airport. At a news 
briefing, the Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said the 
Government had not yet been contacted by the PWC, but he ruled 
out accepting such an invitation under any circumstances. 
  [Begin Macleod recording] Our general stance is this: If 
people in Hong Kong have questions of clarification on the bill 
then, of course, they are welcome to put them and we will answer 
them. That is our normal stance: If people have questions, 
we'll answer the questions. But, there is no question of us 
sending people up to Beijing to appear before the PWC. [end 
recording] 
  Sir Hamish also said he expected the inflation rate to 
remain 
at the present level of around 8 percent during the next few 
years. He said the booming economy meant that there would be a 
surplus this year, despite his deficit budget, but he refused to 
speculate on how big the surplus might be. 
  Speaking in Beijing, the head of China's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office Lu Ping said it would be a sign of noncooperation 
if Hong Kong Government officials did not go to Beijing to 
explain details of the airport corporation bill. He said 
certain items in the bill were not clear and needed explanation 
from Hong Kong officials. Mr. Lu also said Chinese nationals 
born in Hong Kong will not lose their permanent residency if 
they emigrate to other countries. He was speaking one day after 
a senior government official warned that up to 400,000 Hong Kong 
Chinese residents could lose their right of abode in the 
territory. Cliff Bale has this report. 
  [Begin Bale recording] Principal Assistant Secretary for 
Security Simon Vickels told legislators yesterday that the 
setting up of strict criteria for permanent residents could mean 
many Hong Kong Chinese emigrants would lose their right of abode 
after 1997. Mr. Lu disputed this, saying that Chinese nationals 
who return to Hong Kong after emigrating would not lose their 
permanent residence, nor will they have to make an application 
to return here. Mr. Lu also expressed the hope that the 
criteria for non-Chinese nationals seeking permanent residence 
will be kept simple. He said he welcomed people from other 
countries to ensure that Hong Kong remained an international 
financial center. However, Mr. Lu also said this issue would 
have to be discussed further. This will be done by the Security 
Sub-Group of the Preliminary Working Committee, which starts a 
two-day session on Sunday. Several members have suggested that 
criteria such as property ownership, the ability to speak 
Cantonese, and having work or relatives in the territory should 
be used to determine whether a foreigner takes Hong Kong as his 
place of permanent residence. [end recording] 
  Mr. Lu also spoke about yesterday's invitation to government 
officials to visit Beijing to explain details of the airport 
corporation bill. He said that if they rejected the invitation, 
it would be a sign of noncooperation. Mr. Lu also said any 
final decision on the bill would rest with the airport committee 
under the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group.

<F P=106> [By Xie Liangjun: "Hong Kong Power Transition Accelerated"] </F>
  [Text] A specialized preparatory group began meeting in 
Beijing yesterday in a move to accelerate preparations for the 
1997 transition of power in Hong Kong. 
  Specialized panels from the Preliminary Work Committee for 
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) will address political, economic, 
legal, cultural, social and security issues. 
  The first meeting opened yesterday when some 20 members of 
the Economic Group began closed-door discussions at Beijing's 
Hong Kong and Macao Centre. 
  The other specialized panels are expected to begin meeting 
in 
the following days. 
  The series of parleys come nearly month after the cessation 
of marathon talks between China and Britain over Hong Kong's 
electoral arrangement in 1994 and 1995, and at a time when top 
Chinese authorities have called for intensified preparations for 
the 1997 transition. 
  Present at yesterday's Economic Group meeting was Lu Ping, 
Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State 
Council and Secretary-General of the Preliminary Work Committee. 
  The two-day Economic Group meeting will cover problems 
related to construction of the new Hong Kong airport and the 
development of large capital-construction projects in Hong Kong 
and on the mainland. 
  No details were given about yesterday's meeting. 
  In line with the Hong Kong Basic Law, the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR will be established in 1996.

<F P=106> [Report: "Hong Kong Governor To Return to Britain at the </F>
End of This Month To Report on His Work, Review Situation, Study 
Four Tactical Options With Top Hierarchy"] 
  [Text] Governor Patten said in an interview with our staff 
reporter yesterday that when he returns to Britain at the end of 
this month to report on his work, he will discuss with the top 
British hierarchy the situation and plans following the breakup 
of the Sino-British talks on the political system in Hong Kong 
and will further explore four tactical options for handling 
Sino-British relations in the future. Patten said: Under 
circumstances where China and Britain cannot reach full 
agreement on the issue of the political system, the British side 
can still strive to reach a partial agreement with the Chinese 
side on the issue of the political system or reach an agreement 
on issues other than the political system, which states that 
each side goes its own way (agree to disagree). 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last Friday that 
the talks could only be reopened if the Hong Kong Government 
revoked that part of the political reform bill submitted to the 
Legislative Council [Legco]. Responding to this statement, 
Patten pointed out: Legco has already started discussing part 
of the political reform bill, it is impossible for the Hong Kong 
Government to suddenly stop its legislative work, and the 
legislative process concerned process will continue until the 
end of February when Legco passes the bill. He said: The 
Chinese side knew months ago that the Hong Kong Government is 
facing a very big time constraint. 
<H5>  Partial Agreement on Political System Welcomed </H5>
  Faced with a deadlock in which China and Britain still 
cannot 
reopen the talks, Patten said that when he returns to Britain at 
the end of this month to report on his work, he and Prime 
Minister Major, Foreign Secretary Hurd, and other cabinet 
members will review Sino-British relations following the 
suspension of the talks and plan for the next step of the 
legislative work on the electoral arrangements. He will also 
hold in-depth discussions with the top British leadership on 
four tactical options for handling Sino- British relations. 
  Patten said that he will attend a hearing held by the 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee and will discuss current 
Sino-British relations with Foreign Office officials. While in 
London, Patten will meet Robin McLaren, British ambassador to 
China and negotiator at the Sino-British talks, who has 
recovered from an illness, and will discuss the outlook for 
talks with him. 
  Patten said: Now, the top priority of the British side is 
still to strive to hold an 18th round of talks with the Chinese 
side and to strive to reach an agreement on the issues of the 
through train, the functional constituencies, and the electoral 
committee before the Hong Kong Government submits the remaining 
parts of its political reform bill to Legco. He pointed out 
that if both sides cannot reach a full agreement, he welcomes 
both sides trying to reach a partial agreement, for example, 
both sides could reach an agreement on one to two of the three 
large issues, namely, the through train, the functional 
constituencies, and the electoral committee to narrow the gap 
between both sides on the arrangements for the political system. 
For the British side, this is the second option. 
  However, Patten stressed: Even if the partial through train 
arrangement theoretically emerges, there has been hardly any 
sign so far that the Chinese side intends to reach a partial 
agreement. Besides, he said, a partial agreement must contain 
factors which are reasonable and deserve to be upheld. 
<H3>  Vigorously Ensuring Other Kinds of Cooperation While Each 
Side Goes Its Own Way </H3>
  Patten acknowledged that if both sides could not hold 
another 
round of talks, the British side must decide on the electoral 
arrangements on its own. The British side's third option is 
that both sides admit that there are differences over the 
political system, but that they can continue to cooperate with 
each other on issues other than the political system and can 
reach an agreement which states that each side is going its own 
way. He said: Even if China and Britain cannot reach agreement 
on political issues, it does not mean that both sides cannot 
reach any agreement on other issues, and an agreement which 
states that each side goes its own way, is, after all, better 
than no agreement. He added: It is always better to confine 
both sides' differences to a few political issues rather than 
spreading the political impact to other fields. 
  When talking about the British side's final option, that is, 
under a situation where there is no agreement, the Hong Kong 
Government unilaterally submits the remainder of the political 
reform bill to Legco for discussion, Patten said that it was his 
duty to exercise effective rule over Hong Kong and that he 
firmly believed that Legco members would not choose to do 
something which they deem incorrect merely because the Chinese 
side had threatened to cancel arrangements for the political 
system. Patten added: The Chinese side has warned that in 
1997, they will cancel any arrangements on the political system 
with which Beijing does not agree, but different Chinese 
officials give different meanings to "cancellation." Patten 
said: The Hong Kong Government should not, at present, do 
anything to the detriment of the interests of Hong Kong merely 
because the Chinese side may do something to the detriment of 
the interests of Hong Kong in an uncertain future. 
  In the interview, Patten also commented on the preliminary 
work committee of the preparatory committee of the special 
administrative region and analyzed the prospects of Sino-Hong 
Kong cooperation and implementing a high degree of autonomy 
after 1997. In addition, he also talked about China's 
most-favored-nation status, Hong Kong's economic prospects, the 
financial reserves, the overheated real estate market, and other 
issues.

<F P=106> [By Belinda Wallis] </F>
  [Text] TVB has been urged by the writer and director of 
the controversial BBC documentary on Mao Zedong to screen the 
programme. The station has bought, but not scheduled for 
screening, the documentary, which triggered protests from China 
when the BBC showed it last month. Independent documentary 
maker Jeremy Bennett said TVB "should have the courage of their 
conviction to show the film". 
  TVB first saw the one-hour documentary at the MIDCOM 
television festival in Cannes in October where, according to the 
head of sales for the French company Teleimages which 
co-produced and sold the documentary, "every station in Hong 
Kong wanted to buy the programme". TVB was the highest bidder, 
and according to Mr. Bennett, one of the first places in the 
world to purchase the programme in November. But TVB now says 
it has not decided when, or even if, it will screen the 
programme. 
  The documentary, Mao, The Last Emperor, was bought for the 
English-language Pearl channel before the controversy exploded 
and the Chinese Government labelled it vicious slander. 
  Mr. Bennett said he had been told of direct pressure being 
placed on Portugal, Britain and Singapore not to show the 
programme. While Portugal had ignored warnings that it could 
hurt relations between the two countries over Macao and the BBC 
screened it on December 20, Singapore withdrew from purchasing 
the programme after warnings from China. 
  "I sincerely hope the TV station in Hong Kong will screen 
it. 
I don't see why the people of Hong Kong shouldn't see it, 
especially as this is such an important topic to them. I'm 
surprised they haven't already shown it," Mr. Bennett said. 
"Over 20 countries in the world, including all major European 
countries, are seeing this film, so why should people in Hong 
Kong be deprived of seeing this when it is more important." 
  TVB spokesman Lily Chan said the station had not ruled out 
screening the contentious programme. She said the station had 
not talked to any Chinese officials about the documentary and 
that it would not expect any interference from China. "We don't 
anticipate any pressure because there hasn't been any so far, so 
this should not be part of the consideration about when, or if, 
to screen it," she said. She said the controversy surrounding 
the documentary was not the only criteria when considering its 
screening.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao and Li 
Tieying, two high-ranking Chinese Communist Party (CPC) 
officials, today in Beijing met delegates from the workers who 
have been renovating the Potala Palace in Lhasa. 
  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council, 
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, expressed greetings to all 
workers involved in the renovation. 
  The Potala Palace in Lhasa city, capital of Tibet Autonomous 
Region, had not been renovated for 300 years. 
  In 1988, the Chinese government decided to set up a leading 
group, headed by Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee, to take charge of the renovation 
program. 
  The central government also allocated more than 50 million 
yuan and large quantities of materials to the project. 
  Work began in October 1989. By now 86 projects in the 
renovation program have been completed, and work on 17 is still 
going on. 
  Hu said that the Potala Palace is the outstanding work of 
Tibetan culture and one of the treasures in the culture of 
Chinese nation. 
  He said that the palace is not only the symbol of Tibet, but 
also marks the unity of the Tibetan people and the Han people. 
  He said that the palace renovation showed that the CPC and 
the government respect the excellent cultural tradition of Tibet 
and it also showed the party's policies toward nationalities and 
religion. 
  He urged the people working on the renovation to make 
greater 
efforts to complete it. After the renovation is completed, all 
departments concerned should strengthen the management of the 
palace so as to promote the unity of nationalities and to 
contribute to the development of Tibet. 
  Li Tieying, who is also a state councillor, said that the 
renovation program is a rarely-seen project in the world. 
  He said that the renovation with modern science and 
technology and Tibetan traditional techniques will certainly 
produce important impact at home and abroad. 
  According to a renovation group leader, in the past five 
years of renovation work, no ancient art or religious objects 
were damaged or lost. 
  When the renovation of the palace is completed, the 
government of the Tibet Autonomous Region is planning to hold 
celebrations.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- A collection of poems 
written by late Marshal Chen Yi was published today in Beijing 
in memory of his death 22 years ago. 
  Known for his strategic talent and diplomatic acumen, Chen 
was also popular as a poet and "go" player. 
  Collected in the three-volume works are 453 poems (including 
traditional Chinese Ci) in chronological order -- from the prime 
of his life to the revolutionary times and the construction 
period of New China. 
  Chen Haosu, the eldest son of Chen who compiled the books, 
said that it was his father's long-cherished wish to publish a 
collection of poems to depict his 50-year revolutionary career. 
  Chen Yi was among the ten soldiers who received the highest 
military ranks after the founding of the People's Republic of 
China in 1949. Later he became the second foreign minister of 
New China after Premier Zhou Enlai. 
  He died on January 6, 1972.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Zhou Enlai and 
Mao Zedong Thought, a 250,000-character work focusing on 
Zhou's contributions to the formation and development of Mao 
Zedong Thought in the revolutionary and construction periods, 
has been off the press. 
  Written by Professor Liu Yan and Professor Yang Shizhao of 
the Zhou Enlai Research Office of Nankai University in Tianjin, 
the book presents a large amount of historical data to show many 
of his pioneering practices and theories during the periods of 
new democratic revolution and socialist revolution. 
  They include the strategy for the Chinese revolution to 
surround cities from the countryside, an important part of Mao 
Zedong Thought, which could be seen from many of his speeches 
during the agrarian revolution when he served as a principal 
leading member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China. 
  Zhou Enlai died on January 8, 1976.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 21 December broadcasts the 
ninth of a twelve-part documentary entitled: "Mao Zedong." A 
series of editorial reports describing the content of the first 
eight parts of the documentary was published in the Political 
&amp; 
Social section of the 30 December China DAILY REPORT, pages 
25-33. The ninth part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: 
"Unique Perception of a Sentimental Poet," and focuses on Mao's 
literary attainments as a poet, revolutionary, and statesman. 
  After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an 
unidentified narrator: "A Westerner said: A poet has conquered 
New China...." the documentary begins with video shots of a 
construction site in Mao's birthplace, Shaoshan, where 100 stone 
tablets are engraved with Mao's poems -- this project began in 
1992 to commemorate his centennial. Video then shows interviews 
with French statesman Giscard d'Estaing, famed Japanese 
sinologist Nimoru Takeuchi, and leading Chinese writers who laud 
Mao as a poet-revolutionary who composed poems that rhymed with 
the rattling of guns on the battlefield. According to those 
interviewed, Mao's poems, which reflect the vicissitudes of 
Chinese and world history in the 20th century, were written 
mostly under adverse circumstances after he encountered setbacks 
during the Long March, and were filled with revolutionary 
enthusiasm and romanticism, as well as boldness of vision. 
  As the narrator reads and annotates passages of Mao's poems 
during four different periods of his life, namely, his youth, 
the War of Resistance Against Japan, the liberation war, and 
after the PRC's founding, video shows historical footage of 
events, and present-day places connected with Mao. The 
documentary devotes a lengthy portion to Mao's poem "Snow -- To 
the Tune of Qin Yuan Chun," citing people concerned who recount 
the twists and turns prior to publication of the poem in 
Chongqing in November 1945. The narrator recites "Snow," which 
describes the beauty of the land, deplores illustrious Chinese 
emperors lack of literary grace, and says: "For truly great men, 
look to this age alone," thus displaying Mao's bold aspirations. 
The narrator goes onto describe the poem: "The People's 
Liberation Army Captures Nanjing," written in April 1949, as a 
brilliant work which declared an end to the Chiang Kai- shek 
dynasty and epitomized the advent of a new era. With the end of 
the war, Mao's poetry entered a new era. In the fifties, he 
wrote poems inspired by milestones in China's socialist 
construction, such as the Chang Jiang Bridge in Wuhan, the 
elimination of snail fever in Jianxi, and the peasants' 
harvests. From the early sixties on, his creative endeavors 
reached a new peak. As the international and domestic climate 
changed, most of his poems were full of militant spirit. His 
poetry, which also featured snow and flowers, frequently 
combined realism with romanticism. In addition to writing 
poems, Mao also strived to improve his brush painting which he 
used to write his poems; he was an accomplished calligrapher. 
  At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes with the narrator 
acclaiming Mao's poems as expressions of his personal charisma, 
as real pictures of China's revolution and construction, and as 
a monument of 20th century Chinese history.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 22 December broadcasts the 
tenth of a twelve-part documentary entitled: "Mao Zedong." The 
tenth part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: "Splashing 
Water Amid the Stream," and focuses on Mao's passion for 
swimming. 
  After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an 
unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong said: It was rather 
comfortable to swim at Beidaihe during a grade-seven 
typhoon...." the documentary begins with historical footage of 
Mao swimming at Beidaihe beach, in the Chang Jiang, and at 
Shisanling Dam during the last two decades of his life; as well 
as his last recorded swim in a Changsha indoor swimming poor in 
1974 at the age of 81. As the video shows shots of places 
associated with Mao's sporting activities, the narrator recounts 
his endeavor to improve his physique and temper his will through 
rigorous training, and notes that swimming and mountaineering 
were Mao's two main hobbies. The narrator adds that while 
climbing mountains, Mao never made detours and always blazed a 
new path whenever he encountered a dead end. 
  As video shows places where Mao used to swim, the video cuts 
to show interviews with Mao's bodyguards, nurses, doctors, and 
his daughter Li Na, reminiscing about Mao's preference for 
swimming in large rivers and lakes over small ones, to long 
distances over sprints, and rapids over still water; and noting 
that when he swam he never did a specific stroke -- he simply 
swam "free style" as he pleased. While the video continues to 
show footage of places and events associated with Mao, the 
narrator explains: Mao's approach toward swimming fully 
reflected his indomitable spirit to conquer nature. He once 
expressed a wish to swim in the Mississippi and the Ganges. As 
a sportsman and romantic poet, Mao often composed poems after 
swimming. Deeply concerned about floods along the Chang Jiang, 
Mao inspected the Three Gorges time and again in a bid to find a 
way to tame the river. His dream finally came true when the 
Fifth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress approved 
the Three Gorges Project in April 1992. 
  As the video shows historical footage of Khrushchev's 
"secret 
visit" to China in July 1958, the narrator recalls an episode: 
After turning down the Soviet proposal to establish a joint 
fleet during a rigorous debate one morning, Mao invited 
Khrushchev to his swimming pool in Zhongnanhai to conduct the 
afternoon session. When Mao and Khrushchev showed up at the 
pool, Chinese and Soviet officials present were stunned at Mao's 
casual attire, a pair of swimming trunks, and his superb 
swimming skills. The narrator continues: Mao disliked being 
bossed around, and that was one of his invaluable assets which 
transcended into a dauntless spirit in the face of stormy waves. 
  While the video continues to show historical footage of 
related events, the narrator says: "From the late fifties to the 
early sixties, China encountered one upheaval after another on 
both the domestic and international fronts: The deterioration of 
Sino-Soviet relations, armed rebellion staged by separatists in 
Tibet, the Taiwan Strait crisis, Sino-Indian border conflicts, 
and an anti- Chinese wave abroad. In the wake of such setbacks, 
especially the natural disasters following the blunder of the 
Great Leap Forward, Mao exhorted the Chinese people to foster 
the spirit of fearing no devils. Thus, fearlessness against 
devils became the slogan for Chinese people to tide over 
difficulties at home and abroad. In 1962 the Sino-Soviet 
polemics began. Consequently, Soviet experts were withdrawn 
from China, contracts were scrapped, and Soviet-aided 
construction projects were suspended. However, Mao never 
panicked; he told Soviet comrades that in spite of the war of 
words with the Soviet Union, life would go on as usual in China. 
  As the video shows historical footage of a party in which 
close shots are seen of Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De each dancing 
with a female partner, the narrator cites American journalist 
Anna Louis Armstrong's observation during her stay in Yanan: 
"Zhou Enlai's waltz was first rate, Liu Shaoqi's steps were as 
accurate as numbers, and Zhu De danced with the strides of the 
Long March; Mao Zedong danced to the tune of his own rhythm." 
The narrator adds: Therefore, unlike ordinary people who like 
to swim in still water, Mao had a passion for splashing in the 
rapids. 
  While video shows historical footage and interviews with 
people concerned, the narrator recounts the events leading to 
the start of the Cultural Revolution: In June 1966, Mao stayed 
for 10 days at a resort in Shaoshan, doing nothing but reading, 
writing, and swimming. Shortly afterwards, in Wuchang on 16 
July, he plunged into the Chang Jiang and swam 15 kilometers in 
65 minutes at the advanced age of 73. Big crowds of people 
along the river cheered him and shouted: "Long live the 
chairman," and he responded with "Long live the people." The 
Chinese media gave exceptional, extensive coverage to Mao's 
latest swim in the Chang Jiang. As the video cuts to show 
historical footage of Mao waving to the sea of Red Guards during 
parades in Tiananmen Square, the narrator says: "In the brief 
period of 33 days after the swim, Mao, waving an army hat, stood 
on the rostrum atop Tiananmen Gate. The blue sea was turned 
into a red sea. Mao Zedong could not have dreamt the red sea he 
stirred up would last a decade." 
  At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes by showing historical 
footage of Mao walking, talking, and swimming to stress the 
carefree nature of his personality.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 23 December broadcasts the 
eleventh of a twelve-part documentary entitled: "Mao Zedong." 
The eleventh part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: 
"The Family of a Leader," and focuses on Mao's influence on the 
life of his family members. 
  After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an 
unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong told his cousin: You are a 
peasant, and farming is a more stable occupation...." the 
documentary begins with video shots of Mao's two former 
residences in Zhongnanhai. Then, video cuts to show historical 
footage of Mao's visits to his hometown in Shaoshan in the late 
fifties, where he paid respects to his parents' tomb. According 
to interviews with local people, Mao admitted that even though 
he was a communist, materialist, and atheist, he should still 
pay respects to his parents for they had brought him into the 
world. As the video shows photographs of Mao's brothers, 
sisters, and other relatives, the narrators recounts how they, 
inspired by Mao's lofty ideal, joined the revolution and later 
became martyrs. 
  While the narrator introduces Mao's other relatives, the 
video shows shots of a museum in Changsha, Hunan dedicated to 
Mao's first wife Yang Kaihui, where her diary, in which she 
confesses love for Mao, is on display. While the video 
continues to show historical footage and photographs of Mao's 
family, the narrator recounts Yan Kaihui's martyrdom in 1930 and 
the fate of her sons with Mao: Anying, who after spending 20 
years in the Soviet Army was sent to Korea and was killed in the 
war in the early fifties, and Anqing, who became mentally 
disabled during his childhood after torture was inflicted upon 
him by foreign police forces in Shanghai. According to an 
interview with his daughter-in-law, Mao always educated his 
children to never seek privilege and "to live and work like the 
children of ordinary working people." After the narrator 
briefly describes Mao's life with his second wife He Zizhen in 
Yanan, the video shows an interview with Li Min, the only 
surviving daughter of his marriage to He; and Li Na, Mao's other 
daughter from his marriage to Jiang Qing. The daughters 
reminisce about the spartan way they were brought up, but say 
their father left them with an enormous spiritual legacy. 
  The narrator continues: Mao brought up his offsprings the 
way 
he trained cadres. He always advocated: "The preservation of 
the style of being modest and prudent, and guarding against 
arrogance and rashness," as well as the spirit of hard work and 
plain living. To underscore Mao's frugal material life, the 
narrator cites his former head nurse, a train attendant, and 
bodyguards describing, with deep emotion, his thrift and simple 
lifestyle. As the video shows shots of his book-filled former 
residences in Zhongnanhai, worn-out clothes, and other articles 
of daily use in his living quarters, the narrator notes: The 
protracted struggles during the revolution made him accustomed 
to living sparsely. After the PRC's founding, he continued to 
lead a thrifty life because he wanted to set a good example for 
other cadres. In spite of his austere life, he always gave 
generously to friends and relatives in need, and explicitly 
stated that the money came from remuneration for books and 
articles he had written. 
  At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes with video of an 
interview with Mao's cousin Mao Zelian, one of the relatives he 
refused to arrange a job for in the early years of the PRC. Mao 
Zelian, who is 80 and still working in the fields, recalls that 
Mao told him his problem should be solved by the local 
government, and that since he was a peasant, farming would be a 
stable occupation.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 24 December broadcasts the 
twelfth and final part of the documentary entitled: "Mao 
Zedong." The final part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is 
entitled: "Later Years," and focuses on Mao's role in the 
Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping's rehabilitation. 
  After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an 
unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong said: The youth of today and 
tomorrow will appraise the revolution according to their own 
criterion of values...." the documentary begins with video of an 
interview with Nobel laureate Lee Tsung-dao recalling his 1974 
meeting with Mao, during which Mao regretted he had not 
continued the pursuit of natural sciences. In fact, the 
narrator says, due to Mao's failing health, from the early 
seventies on he did not even study his favorite subject -- 
social sciences. Then, as video shows historical footage of Mao 
attending the 10th CPC National Congress in 1973, his former 
head nurse Wu Xujun recalls the ailing Mao being unable to stand 
up from his chair on the rostrum to receive a standing ovation 
from congress delegates. 
  The narrator says: According to the accounts of Mao's 
doctors, he was stricken with one ailment after another in his 
later years, which put "the old man with ceaseless aspirations" 
in the face of "new contradictions." As the video shows 
historical footage of Mao's funeral, as well as shots of the Mao 
memorial hall in Tiananmen Square, the narrator explains: Mao 
always viewed the issue of life and death in a lighthearted and 
humorous way. In a conversation with Edgar Snow in 1965, he 
said he had no way of knowing what the youth of today and 
tomorrow would aspire to, but he added that future generations 
would appraise the revolution according to their own criterion 
of values. This view conforms with the objective law on social 
development. However, in his later years, Mao failed to match 
his theory with practice. A year after the conversation with 
Snow, he began the Cultural Revolution. 
  While the video shows historical footage of Red Guards 
shouting slogans and cheering Mao in Tiananmen Square, the 
narrator says: "Mao Zedong should bear chief responsibility for 
the decade-long calamity brought about by the Cultural 
Revolution in China. Of course, Mao's purpose in initiating the 
mighty mass movement was not to destroy the socialist state he 
himself founded. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: As 
far as Chairman Mao's intentions are concerned, he initiated the 
Cultural Revolution out of consideration for avoiding the 
restoration of capitalism. However, he misapprehended the 
realities in China and consequently led the country into 
large-scale turmoil, which was far beyond his expectations and 
control." The narrator continues: In 1967, Mao contemplated 
ending the Cultural Revolution within three years, but it did 
not proceed as he envisaged. "Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and others 
successively set up two counterrevolutionary cliques and schemed 
to seize supreme power. They exploited Mao's errors and 
committed a host of activities behind his back to the detriment 
of the country and people's interests, causing immeasurable harm 
and damage to the party and state." 
  While the video shows historical footage of the masses 
adulating Mao as "the great teacher, great leader, great 
commander, and great helmsman," the narrator points out: "Mao 
did not entirely reject the people's worship. Nevertheless, he 
began to be wary of this man." Video at this point shows a 
close-up shot of Lin Biao reading the little red book of Mao's 
quotations. Many photographs taken during the Cultural 
Revolution show a stone-faced Mao while Lin Biao shouted "Long 
live Chairman Mao." The narrator continues: During a CCTV news 
documentary made on 1 June 1971 Mao was never seen with Lin 
Biao. The occasion was Mao's 45th and last appearance atop the 
Tiananmen rostrum. 
  As Mao's head nurse Wu Xujun gives an account of Lin Biao's 
failed attempt to blow up the train carrying Mao back to Beijing 
from an inspection tour in the summer of 1971, video shows color 
photographs of several charred corpses and plane wreckage in 
Mongolia, with an on-screen caption reading: "The Lin Biao 
treasonous clique plunging to death on a flight to a foreign 
country on 13 September 1971." The narrator adds: In the wake 
of the incident, Mao decided to reexamine the mass movement and 
pondered several issues. 
  While the video then goes onto show historical footage of 
Marshal Chen Yi's funeral in January 1972, his son Chen Haosu 
recalls how Mao showed up unexpectedly at the funeral in 
defiance of the Gang of Four's orders, and he says that Mao's 
decision to attend was based, to some extent, on the political 
situation at that time. Chen adds that though subjectively Mao 
was unwilling to call off the Cultural Revolution, objectively, 
in view of the leadership vacuum caused by the disappearance of 
Lin Biao, he had to consider the rehabilitation of veteran 
comrades who had been purged. The narrator then adds: "It was 
at the funeral that out of the blue, Mao mentioned Deng 
Xiaoping, who was then toiling in a shabby workshop in the 
suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi." 
  Then, as the video shows historical footage of Deng's 
reappearance on the political scene on various occasions, the 
narrator comments: "On the evening of 12 April 1973 the late 
Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet for Prince Sihanouk of 
Cambodia at the Great Hall of the People. At the banquet, 
people saw a familiar face who had not been seen in public for a 
long time. Deng Xiaoping sat quietly as the curious eyes of 
several hundreds people focused on him. Before the banquet was 
over, reporters rushed to the post office to dispatch the news: 
Deng Xiaoping has been rehabilitated. At the 10th CPC National 
Congress in August 1973, Deng Xiaoping was included in the 
Central Committee. In December the same year at a Political 
Bureau meeting, Mao proposed Deng be made a Political Bureau 
member and chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army (PLA). In a speech at a Political Bureau 
meeting, Mao said earnestly: `It was wrong that I took Lin 
Biao's biased views on several occasions; I should conduct self- 
criticism in front of comrades.' In October 1974 Mao again 
proposed Deng take up the post of first vice premier of the 
State Council. In January 1975, Deng was appointed vice chairman 
of the CPC Central Committee's Military Commission and 
concurrently chief of the general staff of the PLA; he was also 
elected vice chairman of the CPC Central Committee in charge of 
its day-to-day work. Mao placed high expectations on Deng, and 
praised him as a rare talent with a strong political 
orientation." 
  While the video shows more historical footage of Mao and 
Deng, the narrator continues: "Mao praised Deng time and again. 
As early as 1957, when Mao was visiting the Soviet Union, he 
told Khrushchev: `Did you see that short guy over there? He is 
extremely smart and has great potential for growth.' Mao added: 
`This man observes principle and at the same time has 
flexibility; he is a rare talent.' At a Political Bureau 
meeting in December 1973, again Mao said: `Deng handles affairs 
in a decisive manner. He is firm but gentle, like a needle 
hidden inside cotton. Outwardly he is amiable, but inwardly his 
mind is as strong as steel.'" 
  The narrator continues: "While appraising Deng positively, 
Mao always paid keen attention to the domestic economy. On the 
eve of the Fourth National People's Congress session in 1974, 
Mao repeatedly emphasized: `The Cultural Revolution has been 
going on for eight years; it is better to have stability now.' 
He also pointed out the need to push the national economy 
forward. In line with Mao's guidelines, Deng, exerting great 
efforts to open up a new situation in economic construction, 
launched a comprehensive drive to overhaul work in industry, 
agriculture, communications, science and technology, military 
affairs, literature and art, education, and public health." 
  As the video shows more historical footage of Mao and Deng 
on 
various occasions, the narrator continues: "Mao rendered support 
for Deng's work, and repeatedly criticized the interference of 
the Gang of Four. At a Central Political Bureau meeting on 17 
July 1974, Mao used the term four-member faction for the first 
time, and declared: `Jiang Qing does not represent me, but 
herself.' During a talk with Deng in Changsha in October 1974, 
Mao gave explicit support for Deng's fight against the 
unreasonable troublemaking of Jiang Qing and her clique, and at 
a Central Political Bureau meeting said: `It is good that you 
have set up a steel company; I back you up.' Soon afterward, 
Mao more incisively pointed out: `Jiang Qing has ambitions; she 
wishes to make Wang Hongwen the chairman of the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee and herself party 
chairman.' By and large, however, Mao wanted to uphold the 
theory and practice of the Cultural Revolution and, therefore, 
could not understand and solve the problem of the Gang of Four 
once and for all. Neither could he tolerate the drive to 
overhaul work on all fronts launched by Deng in 1975, which 
inevitably developed into a systematic repudiation of the 
Cultural Revolution's left-leaning mistakes. In November 1975, 
Mao made an erroneous decision to criticize Deng and 
counterattack the right-leaning tendency to reverse the verdict." 
  As the video cuts to show historical footage of Mao holding 
Hua Guofeng's hands, the narrator continues: "On 15 June 1976, 
when Mao was gravely ill, he told Hua Guofeng and others about 
his life. He said: `I did two things in my life: One was the 
decades-long fight against Chiang Kai-shek, which resulted in 
his exile to the islands; and the other was the Cultural 
Revolution, which was supported by a few but opposed by many 
people.' In 1976 -- the year of the dragon -- at a crucial 
moment in China's future destiny, on his sickbed Mao did not 
hand over power to the Gang of Four. China owes what it is 
today to Mao's important decision at the time." 
  Then, highlighting Mao's efforts to preserve his image 
abroad 
as a jovial man with a sense of humor, video shows historical 
footage of Mao's meetings with Kissinger and Nixon, and Kaunda 
of Zambia, as well as interviews with them reminiscing about 
their encounters with Mao. Video then shows an interview with 
famed ophthalmologist Tang Youzhi recounting an operation he 
performed on Mao in 1975 to remove a cataract, and with an 
attendant describing Mao's final hours on his sickbed. 
  After the video shows footage of Mao laying in state and 
grief- stricken people congregating in Beijing on the day he 
died, the documentary concludes at 1300 GMT with an on-screen 
postscript reading: "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and 
a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. It 
is true that he made gross mistakes during the `Cultural 
Revolution,' but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his 
contributions to the Chinese Revolution far outweigh his 
mistakes. His merits are primary.... -- Excerpted from the 
`Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party 
Since the Founding of the PRC.'"

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Strengthen and Reform Judicial Work To Ensure </F>
Smooth Development of the Socialist Market Economy"] 
  [Text] A national political and legal work meeting is 
underway. Yesterday, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier 
Li Peng had an informal discussion with some of the delegates 
and gave important instructions on strengthening political and 
legal work, maintaining social stability, and safeguarding 
reform, opening up, and economic development, which fully showed 
that the party Central Committee and the State Council set much 
store by political and legal work and are determined to uphold 
the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously and 
attaching importance to both, thus greatly inspiring comrades 
attending the meeting and vast numbers of capable policemen on 
the political and legal front throughout the country. 
  The key agenda item of the national political and legal 
meeting is studying how to implement on the political and legal 
front the guidelines laid by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and how to strengthen and reform 
political and legal work to ensure smooth and healthy 
development of our socialist market economy in light of the 
outstanding issues which affect social stability. The "Decision 
of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
is the overall plan for establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure in our country and the program of action for 
reforming our economic structure, as well as a working guide of 
our legal and political front. 
  The current domestic and international situation offers us a 
rare and excellent opportunity, but in the process of 
transforming the old system into a new one and readjusting 
various relations of interests, all kinds of conflicts often 
arise. In a certain period of time, criminal offenses and 
economic crimes may increase and such corrupt phenomena as 
embezzlement and bribes will still grow, and all these may 
affect political and social stability. Hence, under the new 
situation of developing the socialist market economy, the 
political and legal front is undertaking a even more arduous 
task and political and legal work can only be strengthened and 
never weakened. Centering on economic construction, the 
political and legal front is faced with two key tasks: First, 
they must spare no effort to create a stable social and 
political environment for reform, opening up, and modernization; 
and second, they must furnish the development of the socialist 
market economy with good legal protection and services. The 
relationship between reform and opening up, economic 
development, and social stability is a dialectic, reciprocal, 
and integrative one. The solid foundation of consolidating the 
stable and unified political situation is to deepen reform, open 
up wider, and accelerate development; whereas the precondition 
of reform and development is to maintain political stability. 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out, "To reform, we must have a stable 
political environment; we can do nothing without this 
condition." Only when we uphold the four cardinal principles 
and maintain social and political stability, can we vigorously 
ensure the smooth proceeding of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Hence, we must resolutely smash disruptive 
activities launched by hostile forces, continue to fight against 
all kinds of criminal activities in a strict and fast manner 
according to law, unremittingly wipe out various hideous 
phenomena in society, resolutely keep launching the 
anti-corruption struggle, and devote our energies to 
investigating and punishing large and important cases. Leaders 
at all levels must learn how to handle internal conflicts among 
the people under the new situation and make efforts to go deep 
among the masses to resolve conflicts. We must carry forward 
the glorious tradition of integrating special work with the mass 
line and rely on the masses to do a good job in the 
comprehensive management of public security. 
  The development and protection of the socialist market 
economy relies on the legal system. The structure of the main 
body of market, the operation of market behavior, and the 
government's macroscopic regulation must all proceed according 
to law, and it is only under these conditions that can we ensure 
that the market economy develops in a fair and orderly 
direction. The political and legal front must give full play to 
the function of serving the socialist market economic structure, 
further strengthen economic, civil, and other kinds of judicial 
work, accelerate the pace of reforming the lawyer and notary 
system, and accomplish all kinds of work related to legal 
services. At the same time, the political and legal front must 
strictly investigate and punish economic criminal cases, such as 
smuggling, fraud, tax evasion, refusal to pay taxes, trade mark 
imitation, and production and selling of fake and poor- quality 
goods, ensure normal operation of the market economy, and 
establish a legal order of the socialist market economy. 
  To fulfill the arduous task of political and legal work 
under 
the new situation, leaders at all levels must conscientiously do 
two types of work simultaneously while attaching importance to 
both. At present, some leading cadres really do not have a 
clear and firm understanding of the thinking of "simultaneously 
doing two types of work" and do one type of work while 
neglecting the other one. They are relatively competent at 
economic work and appear impressive, but they do not give much 
consideration to cultural and ideological progress, party 
building, and the work of maintaining stability. Moreover, some 
of them merely pay lip service to the work without making any 
conscientious efforts. "Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at 
all." The situation of attaching importance to economic work 
without paying heed to political work and attaching importance 
to material progress without paying heed to cultural and 
ideological progress is very dangerous and must be changed 
thoroughly. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out long ago: "Without 
enhancing cultural and ideological progress, material progress 
will also be destroyed and we will take a tortuous path." Even 
if we have rich material conditions, if hideous social phenomena 
break out, corruption runs wild, and the social atmosphere is 
very bad, this type of socialist modernization is not the one we 
want. Hence, we must arm our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reach 
a common ideology and understanding, and strengthen party's 
leadership over political and legal work. First of all, we must 
be determined to solve the kind of problems which are related to 
the ideology and understanding of party and government leaders 
at all levels. 
  We believe that through the national political and legal 
work 
meeting, all the comrades on the political and legal front, 
under the guidelines laid by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, will definitely be able to uphold 
the basic party line, conscientiously perform their tasks, spare 
no effort in blazing a new trail, and be of one heart and one 
mind to make greater and new contributions to fulfilling the 
glorious mission entrusted to us by the epoch!

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Notary Work To Be Upgraded"] </F>
  [Text] The country has mapped out detailed plans to 
upgrade its notary work to better serve the market economy, a 
leading judicial official said yesterday. 
  Currently, China's notary service covers economic, civil and 
business affairs, and helps prevent disputes and stabilize 
social, civil and commercial relations. 
  Deputy Justice Minister Zhang Geng told CHINA DAILY in an 
interview that the planned measures include enlarging the 
service scope and speeding up reforms in notary management. 
  He added that his ministry has finished a draft Notarization 
Law and is expected to submit it to the country's legislature 
for examination this year. 
  He said these measures were mapped out to keep pace with the 
growing role of notarial services in China. 
  Since 1980, when notary work started up again, the number of 
notary institutions has increased from 1,150 to the current 
3,049. More than 16,170 notary public are providing notarization 
for common items, such as contracts, establishment of 
corporations, birth dates, marriage status, education, 
inheritance rights and wills. 
  Both Chinese and foreigners can use the service by paying a 
service fee. Foreigners pay a higher fee. 
  Adjustment of the service fees charged to foreigners are 
still to be decided in line with the newly-adopted single 
floating exchange rate. 
  Last year these institutions handled more than 9 million 
cases of notarization, among which 800,000 were concerned with 
real estate and 600,000 with bank loans. 
  Every year, 98 percent of the notary items show legal 
effect. 
  But, he added, foreigners still are not allowed to conduct 
notary service in China, even though branch law offices have 
been set by foreigners in the country. 
  According to the deputy minister, to strengthen the legal 
status of notary work, the State is to require important 
economic, civil and commercial activities to undergo 
notarization. 
  In helping establish the modern enterprise system in China, 
important notary work must be done involving the charters and 
establishment of corporations transfer of property rights, the 
auction and leasing of enterprises and the qualification of 
representatives of legal persons. 
  Notary service will be provided in the transfer of bills, 
the 
development of real estate, the transfer and mortgage of loans 
and also foreign-oriented economic activities, he added. 
  Zhang also emphasized the need to speed up reforms in 
managing notary institutions. 
  All of these institutions will be gradually changed from 
administrative organs to self-funded institutions without 
governmental interference. 
  And to meet international norms, notary institutions will be 
upgraded to "notary offices," he concluded.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Kidnap Cases </F>
Puzzle Mainland Society, and the Situation Becomes Worse Because 
of Involvement of Public Security Personnel"] 
  [Text] "Kidnapping" behavior gradually has become popular 
on the mainland in recent years, leading to the "hostage 
phenomenon," which has puzzled the society. As some cases 
involved public security personnel, the Central Commission of 
Political Science and Law, the Public Security Ministry, and 
other departments recently have stressed that public security 
personnel are strictly banned from getting involving in economic 
disputes and using their powers to arrest people illegally. 
  According to reports, the Public Security Ministry has 
sensed 
the serious consequences of the involvement of public security 
organs and policemen in kidnapping hostages, and has demanded 
that public security departments at various levels view the 
solemn handling of this lawbreaking and discipline-violating 
behavior as one of the important contents of the anitcorruption 
drive and the rectification of law enforcement work within 
public security departments. The procuratorial organs, which 
have jurisdiction over the investigation and handling of 
"hostage-type" cases, also have removed various obstacles and 
have actively handled these kinds of cases, viewing them as a 
key area. 
  The "hostage-type" cases first appeared in the middle of the 
1980's, and have increased greatly in the 1990's. According to 
statistics provided by the Guangdong provincial procuratorial 
organs, from 1990 to 1992 the incidence of such cases increased 
52 percent. Information from Shanghai shows that in the first 
quarter of last year, cases classified as of the "hostage type" 
exceeded by 50 percent the total number of such cases in the 
previous year. These are just the figures of cases for which 
files have been opened by the procuratorial organs, and the 
"hostage-type" cases for which files could not be opened should 
be even more. 
  The "hostage-type" cases were caused mainly by disputes in 
commercial and trading activities, and kidnapping a hostage was 
the last resort to force someone to pay an outstanding debt. 
Those who were kidnapped were from different walks of life. 
Judged in terms of status, they included factory heads; 
managers; deputies to people's congresses; members of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; soldiers; 
and businessmen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Judged from 
the angle of age, they included babies several months old and 
elderly people of advanced age. Judged from the relations of 
those involved in debts, they included parents, wives, sons, 
daughters, inferiors, relatives, and good friends. 
  As has been pointed out, among those who participated in 
kidnapping activities were many party and government officials, 
as well as cadres and policemen from public security and 
judicial departments. There is a high-sounding excuse for them 
to get involved in the "hostage-type" cases: Investigating 
economic crime. Thus, there is a legal cover for kidnapping 
hostages -- arresting lawbreaking elements -- and there is a 
dignified package for forcing someone to pay an outstanding debt 
-- recovering economic losses. 
  A relevant person analyzed the situation and said that there 
are profound and complicated economic and social reasons behind 
the "hostage phenomenon." One main reason is that the 
development of the commodity economy has greatly increased 
commercial and trading activities in the community, and the laws 
and regulations, as well as law enforcement and supervision 
work, have failed to keep pace. In some localities, it is 
difficult to file a lawsuit, and in particular, it is very 
difficult to open a file for a case that does not involve a 
large amount of debt, while it is difficult to carry out the 
verdicts in some cases. Some creditors find that their 
legitimate rights are not protected, so they must look for 
another way to regain their loans as quickly as possible. 
  Local protectionism is the reason for some government and 
judicial organs to get involved in economic disputes arbitrarily 
and to abuse their powers by detaining people illegally. Under 
the current system, a local government has the power to allocate 
finance to local public security organs, procuratorial organs, 
and law courts; as a result, they have to listen to the orders 
of the local government, and must be responsible to the local 
government instead of to the law. Local interests are involved 
in various economic disputes, and the "hostage phenomena" all 
exhibit one common feature: Most of the kidnappers come from 
the economically undeveloped districts or even poverty-stricken 
districts, and they badly needed their loans returned because 
they lacked money. Some local party leaders would often think 
of using the power of government and judicial departments to 
detain hostages in the name of "handling cases" so as to 
retrieve the outstanding amount of money.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China is to put 
postgraduate courses under a uniform administration to ensure 
the standards of master and doctorate degrees. 
  This was announced by a spokesman of the Academic Degrees 
Committee under the State Council. 
  According to the spokesman, educational authorities will 
keep 
records and start a uniform control system over courses in 
subjects ranging from finance, politics and law to management 
and engineering. 
  He said that recently some universities and institutes had 
rushed to start courses outside their range of accredited major 
subjects and had started to award degrees without approval or 
assessment by the educational authorities. 
  They set up so-called "new majors" and ran training classes 
in coastal areas. To attract more students, they even accepted 
unqualified ones. 
  Furthermore, the spokesman said, it had been discovered in 
Beijing, Shandong Province and Liaoning Province that some 
unauthorized units ignored the country's regulations and were 
running postgraduate courses jointly with overseas colleges. 
  Most of these courses are not accredited to accept 
postgraduates but merely aim at making money. They have no 
entry examinations or necessary management system. 
  Some of them even confer overseas academic degrees, severely 
disturbing China's normal postgraduate education and degree 
awarding system, the spokesman pointed out. 
  He said that to stop the confusing situation, the Office of 
the Academic Degrees Committee had issued a circular on the 
administration of such postgraduate courses. 
  Foreign academic degree certificates awarded by unapproved 
Sino- foreign educational units are not recognized in China, the 
circular stipulates. 
  The spokesman stressed that, to ensure the quality of 
degree- 
holders, his office will organize experts at an appropriate time 
to inspect and assess the educational quality of the courses. 
  He said that students already enrolled in courses who come 
to 
the end of their studies and apply for master degrees will be 
strictly examined. 
  Units which ignore educational quality and run classes and 
award degrees and graduate certificates illegally will be 
seriously punished, he added.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Residents Asked To Buy Houses"] </F>
  [Text] After years of experiments in housing reform, the 
government has finally decided to sell, instead of rent most 
public housing in cities. 
  A package of house sale policies has been worked out by the 
government to enable people to buy their homes. 
  Analysts say that the sale of public houses is an 
"inevitable 
measure" in housing reform. 
  Full-scale housing reform is to start this year and is to 
focus on selling most public houses while raising rents to cover 
future construction costs. 
  A two-tier price system is to be set up. 
  One system will apply to high income earners, under which 
prices will be set according to market levels. 
  The other system, for middle and low income residents, is to 
be in two forms, low-profit price and standard price. 
  Low-profit prices are set after deducting construction 
costs, 
sewage and utility fees, and the profits from real estate 
development. 
  Standard prices cover the cost of building the apartments. 
  The standard price of a new two-room apartment in 1993 is 
three times a couple's average salary in 1992. They are to pay 
12 per cent of their income annually over the span of 25 years 
until they become owners of the houses. 
  The scale for determining low and high income people will 
vary from region to region. 
  The standard price will be an "active" one, meaning it will 
steadily reach up low-profit price by the year 2003, said Liu 
Zhifeng, Vice-Minister of the State Commission for Restructuring 
the Economic System. 
  Houses will belong to buyers, said Liu, who is also the 
director of the Housing Reform Office under the State Council. 
  China's public living quarters cover 2.7 billion square 
metres. Every year the government and enterprises spend at least 
26 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) on maintenance. 
  If 10 per cent of these houses were sold, even at 350 yuan 
($40) per square metre, 94.5 billion yuan ($10.8 billion) could 
be recovered, according to Liu. 
  Officials have said that public housing should not be sold 
at 
prices lower than government-set levels, so as to prevent 
corruption and wild speculation of State property. 
  Officials from the Ministry of Construction said the 
development of real estate industry will also promote the 
construction materials metallurgy, machinery, chemistry and 
forestation industries. 
  Western countries get 10 per cent of their revenue from the 
real estate sector. China earned only 2.3 per cent last year. 
  Raising rents is also an important part of reform. 
  According to the plan, rents will cover the costs of repair, 
management and depreciation through the end of 1995 and will 
later expand to include interest on capital investment and 
housing taxes. 
  To help urban residents buy houses and pay rents, more 
housing accumulation funds will be set up. 
  Shanghai was the first Chinese city to set up the fund. 
Since then, 104 of China's 194 cities above the prefecture 
levels have set up the accumulation fund. 
  Every month, when the couple and their employers pay 5 per 
cent of their salary into the fund, the money is kept in the 
bank under the couple's name. 
  The money from the fund can only be used to buy housing or 
pay the rent and maintenance costs. 
  City residents can also get mortgage loans from the bank to 
buy houses and have been encouraged to buy in installments. 
  The emphasis in housing reform will be put on large and 
medium- sized State enterprises, Liu said. 
  Almost all provinces in China have drafted housing reform 
programmes and the plan has been implemented in more than 10 
provinces and 30 cities. 
  Zhangjiagang Port Administration in East China's Jiangsu 
Province has raised rents by a big margin and sold public 
housing to employees at low-profit price and market price. At 
present, about 92 per cent of the public housing has been sold. 
  The government has also encouraged real estate companies to 
build more low-profit houses. 
  Officials said at least 20 per cent of housing built by real 
estate companies should be affordable to the ordinary.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Opening, Reform Doing Well in Jiangsu"] </F>
  [Text] Nanjing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Further opening up 
and growth of the export-oriented economy over the past year 
have greatly speeded up the process of adopting international 
practices in east China's Jiangsu Province. 
  One of the most developed provinces in China, Jiangsu is 
leading the country in attracting foreign funds and conducting 
import and export trade. 
  According to official statistics, more than 9,000 joint 
ventures were approved in the province in 1993, involving total 
foreign funds of more than 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, doubling 
the figure and 69.5 percent more than that in 1992, respectively. 
  Meanwhile, more well-known international giant companies, 
such as Philips of the Netherlands, the Sweden-based Ericsson 
Telecom, the Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan and Siemens of 
Germany, have come to Jiangsu to establish factories and invest. 
  Ye Jian, director of the Jiangsu Foreign Trade and Economic 
Commission, said that the investment fields have been expanded 
greatly since last year, and the technological structure has 
been improved at the same time. 
  He noted that more and more foreign investment has been 
poured into such fields as computers, laser videos, 
telecommunications, transportation and software over the past 
few years. 
  In the past, foreign investors chose co-operative partners 
among a mass of Chinese companies, Ye said, but now Chinese 
firms seek foreign partners at their own initiative. 
  In order to adopt international practices as soon as 
possible, the province has made great efforts to expand its 
foreign trade by distributing rights to foreign trade to lower 
levels over the past few years. 
  Not only are more firms at the city and county levels 
conducting import and export directly, some scientific research 
institutes and universities now enjoy the same rights. 
  Expanded foreign trade has resulted in a remarkable growth 
in 
the import and export volume of the province. An estimated over 
5.6 billion U.S. dollars of export value was recorded in the 
past year, up 17.8 percent over 1992. 
  In the process of further opening up and economic 
internationalization, economic development zones in the province 
play important roles, official sources said. 
  According to official statistics, by the end of 1993 some 
2,154 foreign-funded companies had been established in the 
zones, with a total investment of some 5.56 billion U.S. dollars. 
  In the meantime, some 2.19 billion yuan (about 251 million 
U.S. dollars) had been paid in profits taxes by those companies. 
  In addition, the province's economic development zones, 
mostly located along the Chang Jiang River, have played a key 
role in boosting the development of the economic belt along the 
river, Ye said. 
  Ye added that he believed that Jiangsu would maintain its 
leading position in opening up and developing its 
export-oriented economy this year.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province is still leading the country in rural industrial 
development. 
  A survey shows that the output value generated by rural 
industrial enterprises surpassed 400 billion yuan in 1993, 
ranking first among all provinces and autonomous regions. 
  The output value of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and Zhenjiang 
Cities, where rural industries are developing more rapidly, 
accounted for three-fourths of the province's total rural 
industrial output value. 
  Known as the "Kingdom of Rural Enterprises," Jiangsu started 
to popularize the share-holding system and cooperation in rural 
areas last year. 
  By the end of last November, more than 2,600 rural 
enterprises had tried out the system and 68 rural enterprise 
groups had been established.

  [Text] At the provincial people's congress work conference 
held on 5 January, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, stressed: Under the new situation of 
establishing and perfecting the socialist market economic 
system, all levels of people's congresses in the province should 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, should conscientiously perform the duties 
entrusted on them by the Constitution and laws under the 
leadership of all levels of party committees, should 
energetically strengthen the construction of the socialist 
democracy and the legal system, should accelerate the drawing up 
of local regulations, and should strengthen supervision over the 
enforcement of laws in order to play a positive role in 
promoting the establishment of the socialist market economic 
system and in ensuring the sustained, rapid, and sound 
development of the socialist modernization. 
  In his speech, Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the numerous and 
fruitful achievements scored by all levels of people's 
congresses in ensuring and promoting the province's reform and 
opening up as well as modernization. Jiang Chunyun said: At 
present, China's socialist modernization has entered a new 
development stage and it is now at a critical moment. All party 
members, cadres, and masses, all party and government leading 
cadres at various levels in particular, must further enhance 
their understanding of the important position and role of the 
people's congress work under the new situation from the high 
plane of stabilizing the state, vitalizing the nation, 
developing undertakings, and promoting social progress. Also, 
they must exploit, in an even more conscious and positive 
manner, the important role of people's congresses at all levels 
in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: At present and during the 
foreseeable future, we should focus the people's congress work 
on drawing up local regulations, economic regulations in 
particular, and on drawing up as quickly as possible a number of 
local rules and regulations that are suitable for the demands of 
developing the socialist market economy in order to form within 
five years the initial form for a basic framework of the legal 
system that will ensure the orderly operation of the socialist 
market economy. We should further strengthen the supervisory 
function of people's congresses to ensure the materialization of 
the general goals and general tasks of the party. At present, 
we should give prominence to the supervision of law enforcement 
to ensure the effective implementation of the Constitution and 
laws. At present, the supervision of law enforcement should be 
focused on solving the problems of refusing to abide by existing 
laws, enforcing laws in a relaxed manner, refusing to deal with 
law breakers, using powers to replace laws and suppress laws, 
and taking bribes in violation of laws. We should actually give 
play to the role of people's congresses in opposing corruption 
and improving administrative honesty. Practice shows that one 
of the reasons for the emergence of some unhealthy trends and 
corrupt phenomena among party and government organs lies in the 
imperfect legal system and the lack of necessary supervision. 
The powers not subject to supervision will certainly lead to 
corruption. Focusing on using the legal system to eliminate 
corruption and improving administrative honesty, all levels of 
people's congresses and their standing committees should rapidly 
draw up and prefect the rules and regulations related to 
improving administrative honesty and should use rules and 
regulations to standardize and restrict the behavior of party 
and government organs and workers. We should give full play to 
the role of people's congresses and actually strengthen the 
building of people's congresses. We should also use a new idea, 
a new attitude, a new style of work, and new behavior to create 
first-class people's congress work and to meet the demands of 
new situations and new tasks. 
  Li Zhen, chairman of the provincial people's congress 
standing committee, presided over the conference. Attending the 
conference were Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee and vice governor of the province; Li Wenquan, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Lu Maozeng, 
chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; Tan Fude, standing committee 
member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission; responsible 
comrades of the provincial people's congress standing committee, 
the provincial higher people's court, and the provincial 
people's procuratorate; responsible comrades of various city and 
prefectural party committees; responsible comrades of various 
city people's congress standing committees; chairmen and 
secretaries general of various prefectural people's congress 
work committees; and responsible comrades of the pertinent 
departments directly under the provincial authorities.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Enterprises in 
Shanghai's Minhang Economic and Technology Development Zone, now 
only 2.13 sq km in size, made record profits over the past year. 
  Situated in suburban Shanghai, the 90 industrial 
establishments operating in the zone registered five billion 
yuan in gross industrial output, 328 million U.S. dollars in 
export earnings and 1.372 billion yuan in profits tax, according 
to the local authorities. 
  In other words, for every one yuan invested in 
infrastructure, this 2.13-sq-km zone attracted 4.26 U.S. dollars 
of investment, earned 5.08 U.S. dollars in foreign exchange, 
turned out 75.28 yuan in gross industrial output and created 
20.2 yuan in profits tax. 
  A local official attributed the success to the zone's policy 
of placing priority on the quality of projects introduced. The 
zone was designed to be built into a high-tech base when it was 
founded in 1986. Most of the products manufactured there are 
hot-sellers on the international market, such as computer discs, 
laser devices and medical products. 
  The official said 37 percent of the operations and investors 
have decided to plow their profits back to enlarge the scale of 
production. 
  Construction is now going smoothly for a 1.37-sq-km 
expansion 
of the zone.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Restructuring will 
enable the financial sector to become the fastest-growing 
economic sector in 1994 in shanghai, China's leading 
manufacturing and commercial center, according to local 
economists. 
  An official of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of 
China (PBC), the country's central bank, said that Shanghai's 
financial sector has been operating normally as a result of the 
campaign to rectify the financial order nationwide. 
  Statistics released by the branch showed that the amount of 
savings deposits in the city in the first 11 months of 1993 were 
33.8 billion yuan (about 3.88 billion U.S. dollars) more than 
that at the end of 1992. 
  During that period, the amount of loans extended by various 
banks in Shanghai was 23.1 billion yuan more than in the whole 
of 1992. 
  Various financial markets were bullish in 1993, the official 
said. For example, trading in the Shanghai foreign exchange 
swap center, the largest of its kind in the country, was heavy 
last year, with nearly 500 billion yuan changing hands. 
  Mao Yingliang, director of the PBC Shanghai branch, said, 
"the stability and prosperity of the financial sector has not 
only helped Shanghai achieve a sustainable, fast and healthy 
economic growth, but also has paved the way for its own further 
restructuring in the new year." 
  He described 1993 as a "year of the reform" for the city's 
financial sector. 
  In the new year various state-owned specialized banks will 
become commercial banks by pursuing what Mao called 
"risk-related management." Competition will be encouraged among 
these banks, Mao said. 
  Moreover, credit co-ops in both urban and rural areas will 
be 
turned into co-operative banks this year so as to better help 
spur the growth of the local economy, he said. 
  He said that the Shanghai municipal authorities have decided 
to permit 26 foreign-funded financial institutions to handle 
business in Chinese currency this year, but within a 
government-prescribed range. 
  The governor said that Shanghai will try even harder this 
year to turn itself into a national financial center. 
  The China Foreign Exchange Trading Center is expected to 
open 
in Shanghai in early 1994 to form unified quotations nationwide. 
  Furthermore, a gold exchange that will adapt to the global 
market will open later this year, Mao said, adding that both 
gold jewelry and gold bullion will be traded on the new exchange. 
  He said, "we are also going to expand and improve short-term 
treasury bond market, inter-bank lending and borrowing market 
and other monetary markets in the new year."

  [Text] Shanghai, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest port, handled imports and exports totalling 12.72 
billion U.S. dollars in 1993, up 30 percent from the year before. 
  An official of the municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation said that exports from Shanghai, the 
country's leading manufacturing center, climbed nearly 13 
percent in 1993 to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The municipal government decided to take all possible 
measures to boost exports, considered a driving force behind the 
city's economic growth, the official said. 
  Large-scale construction and development have kept 
Shanghai's 
import demand rising, he said. 
  As a result, imports soared by almost 67 percent last year 
to 
5.34 billion dollars. 
  The official said that imported technology, equipment and 
raw 
materials helped Shanghai step up its infrastructure 
construction, retool its aging enterprises and promote 
production of foreign- funded businesses. 
  He expected Shanghai's imports and exports to grow further 
in 
the new year. Exports are projected to shoot up by 15 percent 
to 8.47 billion dollars in 1994, while imports are expected to 
rise by around 15 percent.

Secretary and Governor Ruan Chongwu chaired the meeting. 
Present were leading cadres at the deputy-provincial-level and 
above, including Du Qinglin, Yao Wenxu, and Chen Yuyi. (Xu 
Liwen), chief of the investigation team of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, made a special trip to Hainan

on how Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general of the 
provincial government office, framed a person. [passage omitted] 
  The participants pointed out Li Shanyou's expulsion from the 
party, his removal from all posts, and the legal punishment 
meted out to him were justified, adding that all cadres should 
learn a lesson from him, strengthen their ideological remolding, 
and wield their powers for the interests of the party and the 
people. 
  Ruan Chongwu spoke at the meeting. He pointed: Li Shanyou 
has degenerated into a bad element and a criminal. What he did 
violated party and government discipline. Now he has been 
expelled from the party and removed from all his posts. He will 
be given punishment according to law. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yesterday the provincial government called a 
telephone meeting on the implementation of the Teachers Law. At 
this meeting, Vice Governor Zhang Shiying requested all 
localities to focus their efforts on improving teachers' working 
conditions, standard of living, as well as political and 
professional quality, on strengthening their contingent, and on 
protecting their legitimate rights and interests in the course 
of implementing the Teachers Law. 
  He pointed out: A prominent problem at present is the 
arrears of wages for secondary and primary school teachers since 
the end of last year. From Teachers' Day to the end of 
November, the arrears of wages for secondary and primary school 
teachers throughout the province totaled 108 million yuan, 
involving almost 200,000 teachers in more than 80 cities, 
counties, and prefectures, causing big difficulties to these 
teachers' lives and serious influence to educational work, 
particularly rural compulsory education. All localities should 
take this problem into serious account, party and government 
leaders at all levels should pay personal attention to it, and 
the relevant departments should closely coordinate with each 
other. All kinds of necessary measures should be taken and 
different channels should be used to pay these wages before the 
implementation of the Teachers Law, so that these teachers can 
spend the New Year happily. At the same time, measures should 
be taken to prevent the recurrence of the same problem. If 
arrears of wages for teachers occur after the Teachers Law comes 
into force on 1 January 1994, the relevant leaders will be held 
responsible for this according to law. 
  Zhang Shiying also set requirements for supervising 
implementation of the Teachers Law.

  On behalf of the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee, Guan 
Guangfu delivered a work report amid warm applause. He said: 
The current congress will strive to accomplish the following 
tasks: 1) To implement conscientiously the spirit of the 14th 
CPC Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; 2) To review and sum up Hubei's practice and 
experience over the last five years, and especially its 
experience over the last decade, since the reform and opening 
up; 3) To define clearly the future tasks and goals; 4) To 
elect a new provincial party committee and a new provincial 
discipline inspection commission; 5) To mobilize the broad 
masses of party members, cadres, and people in Hubei to further 
emancipate their minds; open up new vistas; forge ahead into the 
future; firmly grasp the current historic opportunity; 
vigorously press ahead with reform and opening up; push Hubei's 
economic development onto a new stage; and achieve the grand 
goal of having a comparatively well-off livelihood in Hubei by 
the end of the century. 
  Guan Guangfu's work report was entitled "Emancipate the 
Mind, 
Grasp Opportunities, Vigorously Push Ahead With Reform and 
Opening Up, Strive To Attain the Grand Goal of Achieving a 
Comparatively Well-off Livelihood in Hubei at a Faster Pace!" 
It was divided into the following three parts: 1) A Review of 
Past Five Years; 2) Strategic Goals and Main Tasks for the 
1990s; 3) Step Up Party Building and Improve Party Leadership. 
The work report contained approximately 25,000 characters. 
  Reviewing Hubei's work over the past five years, Guan 
Guangfu 
said: Over the past five years, the broad masses of cadres and 
people in Hubei have implemented comprehensively the party's 
basic line; have acquired an in-depth understanding of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; have further emancipated their minds; have made 
constant efforts to explore, in light of Hubei's realities, new 
ways and means aimed at deepening reform, expediting 
development, and smoothly attaining the strategic goal of making 
Hubei rise in central China; have persistently deepened all 
reforms; have further expanded opening up to the outside world; 
have gradually accelerated the pace of economic development; and 
correspondingly have improved people's livelihood. Over the 
past five years, party committees at all levels in Hubei have 
grasped persistently and simultaneously the two key aspects of 
work; have taken the overall situation into account; and have 
united and guided the broad masses of party members, cadres, and 
people in unswervingly forging ahead and constantly opening up 
new vistas. 
  After fully affirming Hubei's achievements in four main 
sectors in the last five years, Guan Guangfu stated: Now that 
the entire country is accelerating the pace of reform and 
opening up, and now that many fraternal provinces and 
municipalities are accelerating their economic development, we 
face increasingly keen market competition. Should we fail to 
accelerate our own development, we soon will find ourselves 
lagging behind. In view of this situation, we should strive to 
develop a sense of crisis, of urgency, of historical 
responsibility; we should seize each and every opportunity; 
accelerate development; catch up with and overtake others; 
safeguard Hubei's position as a strong industrial base; and live 
up to the ardent expectations of the more than 50 million 
diligent and talented Hubei people. 
  Guan Guangfu maintained that Hubei's practice over the past 
five years has fully attested to the great importance of 
adhering to the party's basic line under the guidance of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We 
should work in a creative manner and in light of Hubei's 
realities. Speaking specifically, we should focus on the 
following six work aspects: 1) To vigorously step up 
theoretical study and ideological transformation and to 
constantly emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts; 2) 
To more clearly understand that development is the last word [fa 
zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810] and 
to unswervingly unify speed, efficiency, and reserve strength; 
3) To deepen reform, expand opening up, and build a socialist 
market economic structure in a more expeditious manner; 4) To 
make overall arrangements and constantly optimize Hubei's train 
of thought and strategic layout; 5) To continually allow 
overall policies to create a micro-atmosphere and bring into 
full play the enthusiasm and creativity of all areas and all 
quarters; 6) To carry out party building successfully and to 
grasp both key aspects of work firmly and at the same time. 
  Speaking of Hubei's strategic goals and main tasks for the 
1990s, Guan Guangfu observed: In the 1990s, Hubei should strive 
to attain the following 11 basic goals: 1) To maintain average 
annual gross national product growth at or above 9.2 percent; 
2) To gradually push economic growth onto three new stages; 3) 
To have tasks outlined in the province's eighth five-year plan 
fulfilled by 1994 -- one year ahead of schedule; 4) To have 
gross national product quadrupled by 1997 -- three years ahead 
of schedule; 5) To raise gross national product to more than 
200 billion yuan on the basis of constant prices recorded in 
1990; 6) To rapidly raise total rural social output value, 
industrial output value, and tertiary industrial output value; 
7) To raise the technical and equipment level of all major 
trades and professions to or near the country's advanced level; 
8) To strengthen overall scientific and technological capacity 
by a large margin; 9) To have nine-year compulsory education 
basically implemented, juvenile illiteracy eradicated, and labor 
quality comprehensively improved across the province; 10) To 
extend afforestation and improve the ecological environment to a 
great extent; 11) To raise the net per capita income of 
peasants to 1,400 yuan, eradicate poverty in poverty- stricken 
areas, and raise the average net per capita subsistence income 
of urban residents by 6 percent or more annually. 
  Guan Guangfu stated: In order to attain all grand goals set 
for the 1990s, we should make every possible endeavor to 
accomplish the following 13 major tasks: 1) To vigorously press 
ahead with all reforms; 2) To rapidly build a socialist market 
economic structure; 3) To expeditiously expand opening up to the 
outside world; 4) To energetically expand the proportion of the 
export-oriented economy; 5) To readjust and optimize the 
economic structure; 6) To improve the overall provincial 
national economic quality, as well as its structural efficiency; 
7) To further perfect the province's regional economic layout 
by devoting more energies to developing and exploiting the 
Changjiang economic belt; 8) To comprehensively implement the 
strategy of developing Hubei by virtue of scientific, 
technological, and educational development; 9) To actively and 
persistently build socialist democracy and the legal system; 
10) To firmly grasp both key aspects of work at the same time; 
11) To step up socialist spiritual civilization building; 12) 
To conscientiously implement all basic national policies, such 
as family planning, land management, and environmental 
protection; 13) To constantly heighten people's living 
standards and improve the quality of their livelihood. 
  Speaking of stepping up party building and improving party 
leadership, Guan Guangfu noted: Stepping up party building and 
improving party leadership are the key to enabling Hubei to 
enter the market economy orbit, to attain the desired economic 
construction goals, to consolidate and develop a lively 
political situation of stability and unity, and to promote 
two-civilizations building to a new stage. Thus we should make 
unreserved efforts to concentrate on the following nine work 
aspects: 1) To profoundly study the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics; 2) To build strong 
leading bodies,as well as competent contingents of cadres; 3) 
To step up the building of party style and clean government and 
resolutely further the anticorruption struggle; 4) To build 
strong party organizations, as well as competent contingents of 
party members at the grass-roots level; 5) To persist in the 
system of democratic centralism and strengthen vitality of the 
party organizations; 6) To strengthen leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work, and create a favorable social 
and public-opinion environment for reform, opening up, and 
economic construction; 7) Party committees at all levels in 
Hubei should adhere to economic construction as the center, take 
overall interests into account, and have the overall situation 
well in hand; 8) To strengthen unity within the party and among 
the whole people so as to consolidate and develop a patriotic 
united front in the new historical period; 9) To constantly 
improve work style, seek truth, and carry out work in a 
down-to-earth and thoroughgoing manner. 
  Guan Guangfu concluded: As we are facing onerous tasks and 
shouldering heavy responsibilities in the 1990s, we should 
implement the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the spirit of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in 
an in- depth manner; mobilize the broad masses of party members 
and people in Hubei; work with one heart and one mind; 
constantly strive to become stronger; vigorously forge ahead 
into the future and improve work; firmly grasp the current 
golden opportunity; bring about a historic revolution with 
regard to reform and opening up, a great leap forward in 
economic construction, and gradual improvement of people's 
livelihood; strive to successfully fulfill all tasks laid down 
at the current congress; and greet the forthcoming 21st century 
with a new attitude!
