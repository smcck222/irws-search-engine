  [Text] In a report to the sixth provincial party congress, 
Comrade Guan Guangfu pointed out that to fulfill the grand 
objective for the 1990's, there is a need to have more dynamic 
reform and to expedite the establishment of the socialist market 
economy structure. He said: The 14th CPC Congress and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee laid 
down the basic framework of the socialist market economy 
structure. A series of reform measures has been or will be 
announced. In accordance with the unified central arrangements, 
we should be bold and good at making overall progress and at 
bringing about breakthroughs in focal points in light of Hubei's 
specific conditions. 
  1. We must emancipate our minds significantly, really 
understand that the fundamental task of socialism is to 
emancipate the productive forces, uphold the basic standard of 
the three favorable's, and free ourselves from all sorts of 
ideological binds resulting from the abstract debate over 
whether something being done is of a socialist or capitalist 
nature. 
  2. We must make a major move in terms of policy, thoroughly 
rid ourselves of the influence of the traditional planned 
economic structure, and in the planning, financial, monetary, 
commercial, and trade fields, we should work out a set of rules, 
regulations, and methods corresponding to the market economy. 
  3. In action, we must produce actual results and develop 
the spirit of being bold in blazing new trails. In 
macroeconomic management and microeconomic invigoration, we must 
do well. For these reasons, we must do the following jobs 
successfully, and in accordance with the realities in Hubei: 1) 
While focusing on improving large and medium-sized state 
enterprises, we must expedite the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system; 2) We must cultivate and develop a market 
system so as to form a uniform, open, competitive, and orderly 
market; 3) We must expedite institutional reform, transform 
government functions, and make a success of macroeconomic 
regulation and control; 4) We must actively carry out financial 
and taxation structural reform and must establish a local 
financial and taxation system; 5) We must deepen investment 
structural reform and strengthen the formation of a local 
investment structure; 6) We must widen the avenues leading to 
fund sources and strive to turn Hubei into the country's fund 
pool.

  [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Guan Guangfu 
today delivered an important speech at the First Plenary Session 
of the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee. He said: Now that 
the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress has completely fulfilled 
its agenda and the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee has elected the members, secretary, and 
deputy secretaries of the standing committee of the provincial 
party committee, we have accomplished the task of forming such a 
collective leading body as the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC 
Committee. We also have endorsed a list of members, secretary 
and deputy secretaries of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission standing committee who were elected at the First 
Plenary Session of the Hubei Provincial CPC Discipline 
Inspection Commission. 
  The fact that we have been elected members of the Sixth 
Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee shows that the broad masses of party 
members and people in Hubei have placed their trust in us. At 
present, Hubei is at an important juncture of reform, opening 
up, and modernization building. So the newly elected Sixth 
Hubei Provincial CPC Committee has been entrusted with a 
glorious and arduous historical mission. We must rally closely 
around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
nucleus; conscientiously implement and carry out to the letter 
the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
under the guidance of both Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line; mobilize, organize, and lead the broad masses of 
party members, cadres, and people in Hubei to firmly seize the 
current historical opportunity and vigorously press ahead with 
reform and opening up; carry forward our cause; forge ahead into 
the future; make more progress and headway; strive to open up 
new vistas for Hubei's work by adopting a new mental attitude 
and a new style; fulfill all tasks laid down by the Sixth Hubei 
Provincial CPC Congress; and strive to live up to the trust of 
the party and the ardent expectations of the people. 
  Guan Guangfu also spelled out the following views on 
stepping 
up party building within the newly elected Sixth Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee: 
  1. To strengthen the study of theory. At present, Guan 
Guangfu said, it is all the more imperative to study 
conscientiously Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with a view to 
enhancing a sense of consciousness and of resolution with 
respect to implementing and carrying out the party's basic line 
and the party's principles and policies aimed at developing a 
socialist market economy; scientifically, systematically, 
farsightedly, and creatively carry out all types of work; and 
study new theories, especially market economic theories and 
modern science and technology, in light of the new conditions. 
It should be noted that as we are still far from proficient in 
these fields, we have yet to make redoubled efforts to catch up. 
  2. To carry out work in a realistic and down-to-earth 
manner. By pooling the wisdom of all, the Sixth Hubei Provincial 
CPC Congress worked out a number of strategic goals and tasks 
for Hubei throughout the 1990s. Therefore, we should carry 
forward a revolutionary spirit of hard work, plain living, and 
selfless sacrifice in all types of work. First, we should 
strive to develop democracy, prudently make decisions on a 
scientific basis, and map out more realistic and feasible 
policies and measures. Second, we should combine collective 
leadership with division of work and responsibilities, clearly 
define responsibilities for major sectors, and enable cadres to 
assume personal responsibilities for their work. To this end, 
various prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures, as well 
as all major fronts, should firmly establish a system under 
which party committee standing committee members are assigned 
specific job-related responsibilities and are able to comprehend 
and tackle major issues in a timely fashion. Third, we should 
strengthen a sense of the overall situation and oppose selfish 
departmentalism. Fourth, cadres should assume personal 
responsibilities for their work and undertake to improve a 
feedback analysis system. Fifth, we should conscientiously 
carry out investigation and study, show more concern for 
grassroots work, dispatch more cadres to grassroots level, go 
deep among the broad masses of people as well as into the 
reality, acquire first-hand information about grass-roots work, 
personally listen to views of the masses; study new situations, 
and tackle new problems. Sixth, we should bring into full play 
the roles of various functional departments; cut down on the 
number of entertainment activities in which provincial leaders 
are involved; and reduce the number of meetings, documents, and 
ordinary news reports. Members of the provincial party 
committee standing committee should concentrate more efforts on 
carrying out in-depth investigation and study, and on discussing 
and tackling major issues. 
  3. To persist in a democratic centralism system. To this 
end, first, we should persist in and perfect a system under 
which the provincial party committee standing committee makes 
regular work reports to the provincial party committee, and 
under which major decisions are made after exhaustive 
discussions among the standing committee members. Second, we 
should strengthen the provincial party committee standing 
committee's collective leadership. After the current plenary 
session, we should immediately convene a provincial party 
committee standing committee meeting at which we will study ways 
and means aimed at establishing and perfecting several basic 
work systems for the provincial party committee standing 
committee, including a standing committee meeting system, an 
investigation and study system, a work responsibility system, a 
personnel appointment and removal system, a diligent and honest 
government system, and so on. We also should work out a number 
of specific, applicable, and detailed rules and regulations; 
improve democratic activities; carry out criticism and self- 
criticism; and constantly enhance unity within the standing 
committee. Members of the provincial party committee and 
standing committee should listen modestly to views from 
different quarters and should consciously accept supervision by 
the party and people. 
  4. To resolutely carry on a protracted struggle against 
corruption and build a clean government. The newly elected 
Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee must strive to withstand 
the test confronting the ruling party and the test of reform and 
opening up, and should make resolute and unswerving efforts to 
build a diligent and clean government and oppose all sorts of 
corrupt phenomena. In accordance with the spirit of the 
instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
on opposing corruption and building a clean government, I would 
like to propose the following rules and regulations. I do hope 
that leading cadres at all levels in Hubei will set a good 
example in observing them: 1) Leading cadres should take the 
lead in observing all five regulations promulgated by the 
central authorities on performing official duties honestly and 
abiding strictly by the law; 2) Leading cadres should take the 
lead in carrying forward the tradition and style of hard work 
and plain living, and in opposing all types of extravagance and 
waste; 3) Leading cadres should avoid using luxury cars and 
taking large entourages, and should spend money and have meals 
according to relevant regulations whenever they go down to the 
grass-roots level; 4) Leading cadres should not try to build, 
decorate, or occupy residences in violation of relevant 
regulations; 5) Leading cadres should use cars in accordance 
with the relevant regulations and should not purchase luxury 
cars or replace old cars with luxury models without official 
approval. As the New Year and the Lunar New Year are coming, 
all provincial party committee members should set a good example 
in performing official duties honestly and abiding strictly by 
the law. 
  5. To firmly adhere to economic construction as the center, 
strive to deepen reform and expand opening up, take overall 
interests into account, strengthen coordination among all 
parties concerned, and make a success of Hubei's work with the 
support of the broad masses of cadres and people.

<F P=106> [By reporters Ji Tao (4764 3447) and Li Botao (2621 3134 </F>
3447): "Foster Lofty Ideals, Study Knowledge, Improve Skills, 
and Strive To Become Trans-Century Talented People"] 
  [Excerpts] The ninth day of December marked the 58th 
anniversary of the "9 December" movement. The Beijing Municipal 
Students' Federation ceremoniously held its seventh congress on 
that date. Chen Xitong, Zhang Jianmin, Li Zhijian, Chen 
Guangwen, Jiang Daming, Wang Tong, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, 
Tao Xiping, Hu Zhaoguang, Feng Mingwei, Chen Dabai, and Yao Wang 
attended the opening ceremony. [passage omitted] 
  The municipal students' federation now has 900 member units. 
In the past four years, 160,000 college and high school 
students in Beijing applied to join the party, 14,016 students 
joined party organizations, and 2,817 students became national 
or municipal three-good students. 
  Chen Xitong gave a speech at the congress. He said: I 
attended the congress of the students' federation four years 
ago. Rapid and great changes have taken place in these four 
years. I would like to hold a heart-to-heart talk with you 
students. I will speak on three questions for your discussion: 
1) what is the most lofty and beautiful people's ideal, 2) how 
should they turn this ideal into reality, and 3) how should 
they work to achieve this ideal. 
  Chen Xitong said: These are important questions on why 
people live. Everyone has his own ideal. In my opinion, rather 
than the ideal to make a few people affluent and happy, no ideal 
is loftier than the one to let all Chinese people lead affluent 
lives. Such a lofty ideal is a communist ideal, and those who 
fight for it are good youths. Of course, we should acknowledge 
our backwardness, but never should we be resigned to it. Only 
those who do down-to-earth work in order to change backwardness 
comprise the backbone of China, and youths should embrace only 
the idea of changing backwardness as the concept on life. Chen 
Xitong also said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics clearly indicates the 
road we should take. On the road of building socialism, young 
students should acquire knowledge well and master skills. Only 
by so doing can they have the strength to work hard. They must 
never be "lazy in youth lest they regret in old age."

  [Excerpts] The agreement signing ceremony on the 
construction of the second-phase project of Beijing's Dongfang 
Square--one of the big municipal projects to invite business and 
investments--was held at Diaoyutai state guesthouse yesterday. 
Government of Dongcheng District and representatives of Hong 
Kong Huixian Investment Company, Ltd. signed the agreements 
respectively. Chen Xitong, secretary of Beijing Municipal party 
committee, Deng Nan, vice minister of the state commission for 
science and technology, and Zhang Baifa and Wang Baosen, 
executive vice mayors, attended the signing ceremony. 
  Before the signing ceremony, Chen Xitong and other leaders 
met with the noted Hong Kong enterpreneurs, including Li 
Jiacheng, Dong Jianhua and Li Hanzhao. Chen Xitong extended 
welcome to the friends from Hong Kong who came to conduct 
cooperation. He said: Viewed on a long-term basis, Beijing 
will become a more open, modern city. I think many people will 
notice this. At present, Beijing has approved of the 
establishment of over 7,000 of the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises. We welcome more people to come and stage their 
performances in the "arena" of Beijing and to conduct 
emulations. We will support those who run fast in the race. 
The second-phase Dongfang Square construction project jointly 
built by Dongcheng District and Hong Kong Huixian Investment 
Company. Ltd. is a huge project. It is hoped that both sides 
will conduct more consultations, maintain close cooperation and 
do a good job in designing this project. The Beijing 
construction team is capable of undertaking formidable tasks. 
We will spare no effort to support this team in starting 
construction and finishing it early. Chen Xitong said: China 
is thriving and marching towards the goal of becoming better-off 
with great confidence. Beijing is a developing city. Over the 
past few years, it has completed a construction area of more 
than 10 million square meters every year, of which, 5 million 
square meters are residental homes. However, the most arduous 
task in attaining the goal of becoming well-off is the housing 
problem. Your willingness to actively participate in the 
capital's housing construction projects in addition to your 
investments and cooperation in some large items are greatly 
welcomed. [passage omitted] 
  Tie Ying, Huang Chao and Huang Jicheng and other municipal 
leaders also attended the signing ceremony and meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporter Bai Fuyi (4101 4395 5030) of Beijing People's </F>
Broadcasting Station and BEIJING RIBAO Reporter Liu Zhengfei 
(0491 2973 7236): "Accelerate Tree Planting and Realize the 
Goal of Making the Municipality's Tree Coverage Rate 40 Percent"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the municipal government held its 
26th executive meeting to adopt in principle the opinions of the 
office under the capital's greening committee on making the 
whole municipality's tree coverage rate reach 40 percent. Chen 
Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, and Mayor Li 
Qiyan gave important speeches. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, Chen Xitong pointed out: It is not easy to 
make the whole municipality's tree coverage rate rech 40 
percent. Leaders at all levels and various departments must hold 
responsibility to the people, formulate good plans and guarantee 
their implementation. Leaders at all levels must enhance their 
sense of making the municipality green. In addition to clearing 
up the occupied wooded areas and forbidding the people from 
occupying greenbelt areas, they should also tap the 
tree-planting potential. At present, many units can plant trees 
and flowers in their neighborhoods but they fail to do so, 
therefore, they have great potential for planting trees. 
Starting from each and every street, we should investigate the 
tree planting potential of all units along the street and urge 
them to plant more trees, to speed up their efforts in tree 
planting and to do good things for the people. It is necessary 
to resolutely stop the act of damaging trees because this is the 
most uncivilized. Strenuous efforts should be made to plant 
trees in major areas and along road bridges. 
  In his speech, Li Qiyan pointed out: Enabling the tree 
coverage rate to reach 40 percent is one of the important tasks 
of realizing the goal of becoming well-off. We should share the 
tasks with the lower levels, conduct inspection every year, and 
must not settle accounts during the last minute. The key to 
realizing the tree- planting target lies in the city proper. It 
is difficult to plant trees in the city proper. If we fail to 
do a good job in planting trees in the city proper, greenbelt 
areas will be encroached upon rather than expanded upon. If the 
city proper can guarantee the fulfillment of the greening task, 
the suburban and outlying areas will also be able to fulfill 
their tasks. All relevant departments should support this. 
  The meeting also heard briefings given by the municipal 
planning commission on the municipality's key construction items 
next year. 
  Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee; Zhang Baokang, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi and Qiang 
Wei, members of the standing committee of the municipal party 
committee; Li Yongan, secretary of the municipal discipline 
inspection commission; Ren Tieying, vice chairman of the 
municipal people's congress standing committee; and Feng 
Mingwei, vice chairman of the municipal committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, also attended the 
meeting.

(1598 0251 5300), and Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472): "Commodities 
Are Ample, Markets Stable, and Supplies Good"] 
  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 21 December, leaders of the 
municipal party committee, people's congress standing committee, 
government, committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, and discipline inspection commission 
formed four teams to inspect Beijing's work of stabilizing 
prices of grain, oil, vegetables, eggs, and meat. Over the past 
few days, all districts in the municipality have conscientiously 
implemented the arrangements of the emergency conference of the 
municipal government and the measures for stabilizing prices. 
They rapidly stabilized prices in two days, thus winning the 
support of the masses. The markets have been stable, 
commodities ample, and supplies good. 
  Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
emphasized: We should intensify inspection and rely on the 
supervision by the masses to ensure that measures for 
stabilizing grain, oil, vegetable, egg, and meat prices are 
conscientiously implemented. Workers of grain departments have 
worked hard, and some of them receive a low income. We should 
conduct earnest investigation and study and pool efforts from 
various fields to change such a situation through reform. Mayor 
Li Qiyan emphasized that the present inspection proved that the 
municipality is determined to stabilize prices and to set the 
people's minds at ease for happy New Year and Spring Festival. 
  Chen Xitong, Ouyang Wenan, Meng Zhiyuan, Meng Xuenong, and 
Fan Yuanmou conducted inspection in Chongwen and Fengtai 
Districts. All the grain and oil shops and markets of farm 
products implemented the regulations on price ceilings, and all 
people and retailers expressed understanding and support. 
[passage omitted] 
  On that morning when inspecting environmental sanitation, 
Chen Xitong did not forget to inspect prices and listen to the 
masses' opinions. In a market of farm products on the Hepingli 
Middle Street, an old teacher met with the former mayor and said 
frankly: "Vegetable prices have dropped today when you are 
conducting inspection. They will go up right after you leave." 
Chen Xitong said to her: "Inspections by the municipality and 
various districts are necessary, but people's supervision is 
more important. You may report whenever you discover wanton 
price hikes, calling Mayor Li Qiyan, Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa, or 
me." An old comrade went forward and said: "What if the 
telephone line is dead?" Chen Xitong said: "You may write 
letters." "Can you receive the letters?" Chen Xitong said: 
"Yes, we can. Please rest assured." When a person said that 
the noodle price of the Qingniangou no. 1 grain shop was higher 
than the price ceiling, Chen Xitong immediately ordered 
Dongcheng District leaders to inspect and handle this matter. 
Some retailers talked about their views on the price difference 
between wholesale and retail sale and on fixing prices according 
to quality. Chen Xitong asked pertinent departments to 
conscientiously study and handle these issues. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472): "Emancipate the </F>
Mind, Seize the Opportunity to Accelerate Reform, Opening Up, 
and Economic Development, and Strive To Achieve A Fairly 
Comfortable Standard of Living Ahead of Schedule"] 
  [Excerpt] The municipal government held its second plenary 
meeting on 24 December. It relayed the guidelines of the 
national economic work conference and made initial arrangements 
for Beijing's 1994 reform and development based on the 
requirements of the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th Party Central Committee and the national economic work 
conference. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, attended the meeting, and Mayor Li Qiyan gave a 
report. 
  Li Qiyan relayed the major guidelines of the national 
economic work conference and spoke on Beijing's 1993 economic 
work. He said: This year is the first year for the new 
municipal government to carry out its work. Thanks to the 
correct leadership of the party Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the municipal party committee and the support of 
the various democratic parties and friends outside the party, 
the people throughout the municipality have conscientiously 
studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, adhered to the party's basic line, 
and, based on Beijing's specific conditions, further emancipated 
the mind and comprehensively accelerated reform and opening up 
with new ideas and large-scale measures. Thanks to the good 
foundation laid by the previous government, the economy has 
developed in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, and it is 
certain that the goal of "making this year's achievements 
surpass last year's" will be attained. 
  Li Qiyan said: Beijing's gross domestic product is expected 
to reach 84.5 billion yuan this year, up 11.8 percent in terms 
of comparable prices. We conquered the catastrophic drought 
unheard of in 50 years to make this year the 16th bumper harvest 
year in a row. Grain per-unit yield and total output set new 
records, the production of a wide range of farm and sideline 
products increased, and market supplies were ample. The output 
value of township enterprises is expected at 56.8 billion yuan, 
up 53.3 percent from the preceding year. In industry, we 
overcame numerous unfavorable factors to maintain a fairly high 
growth rate. Industrial output value is expected at 124 billion 
yuan. Economic benefits grew basically at the same pace with 
production, industrial technology advanced more rapidly, 
adjustment of industrial composition was accelerated, readily 
marketable new products increased, and product quality improved. 
The tertiary industry developed continuously, and construction 
of large commercial and service facilities and development of 
new trades were expedited. The proportion of the tertiary 
industry is expected to reach 46.3 percent, nearly 2 percentage 
points higher than in the preceding year. Local revenue is 
expected at 8.41 billion yuan, up 4.8 percent. Markets were 
brisk, and retail sales are expected at more than 54 billion 
yuan, up 27 percent. 
  Li Qiyan said: Urban construction was expedited in the past 
year, and, with a large number of key water, electricity, gas, 
and heat supply projects, roads, and telecommunication projects 
completed, eye-catching changes took place in urban and rural 
areas. The expressway to the Shoudu Airport, the renovation of 
the east third ring road, Guangning Road, the Beijing section of 
Beijing- Shijiazhuang Expressway, and Migu road were completed 
and opened to traffic. The Beijing key post and 
telecommunication project passed state inspection. Construction 
of the large Jingtang Harbor, Beijing west railway station, and 
Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant, and other key projects 
proceeded smoothly. Houses totaling 10 million square meters in 
floor space are expected to complete in urban and rural areas, 
of which 6 million square meters will be residential houses. 
New achievements were also won in tree planting to green and 
beautify the city. 
  Li Qiyan said: The municipality achieved new progress in 
science and education. Urban and rural people's living standard 
was raised to a new level. The increase in urban people's per 
capita cost of living income is expected to be 8 percentage 
points higher than price increase, and peasants' per capita 
income is expected at 2,123 yuan. New breakthroughs were made 
in the reform focusing on establishing the socialist market 
economy system and transforming enterprises' operating 
mechanism. The endeavor of opening to the outside world 
developed in unprecedented range and quality. 
  Speaking on the initial arrangements for next year's 
economic 
work, Li Qiyan said: Next year is an extremely important year 
for comprehensively implementing the "decision" of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th party Central Committee and 
establishing the socialist market economy system more rapidly. 
It is also a crucial year for accelerating the socialist 
modernization of the capital and striving for a fairly 
comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule. 
Based on the guidelines and arrangements of the national 
economic work conference, the municipal government has conducted 
repeated study of next year's economic work. The basic idea for 
next year's economic work is to emancipate the mind, seize the 
opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and economic 
development, and strive for the fairly comfortable standard of 
living three years ahead of schedule. Emphasis should be placed 
on the following work next year. First, focusing on 
establishing the modern enterprise system and macroeconomic 
regulating and control system, we should establish the socialist 
market economy system more rapidly. Second, We should open 
wider to the outside world to achieve a new breakthrough in 
using foreign capital. Third, we should optimize the industrial 
composition, improve economic efficiency, and maintain the good 
trend of rapid development in urban and rural economy. Fourth, 
we should have the greatest determination and devote utmost 
efforts to speed up construction of urban infrastructural 
facilities and raise the modernization level of urban and rural 
areas. Fifth, we should develop the advantage in our status as 
the national capital and accelerate scientific and technological 
progress and personnel training. 
  Li Qiyan emphasized: To complete next year's work smoothly, 
leading cadres at all levels should keep their understanding in 
pace with the developing situation. They should, first of all, 
further emancipate their minds. In accelerating the 
establishment of the new system of the socialist market economy 
and the capital's modernization drive, we will face many 
unprecedented new tasks, and bold explorations are urgently 
needed. Whether the urban and rural economy, reform, and 
opening up of the capital can be developed greatly is determined 
by whether leading cadres at all levels can greatly emancipate 
their minds. Some leading cadres still fail to fully emancipate 
their minds. This problem remains conspicuous in some aspects. 
How should they further emancipate their minds? Based on 
Beijing's reality, leading cadres at all levels should further 
emancipate their minds concerning the endeavors of extending the 
degree of reform and opening wider to the outside world, with 
the focus on establishing the new system of the socialist market 
economy more rapidly. They should emancipate their minds to 
resolve the difficulties and problems in economic development 
and to meet the requirements for achieving sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development and the fairly comfortable standard 
of living ahead of schedule. When their minds are emancipated 
and when they truly proceed from Beijing's reality, they will 
have new ideas and adopt large-scale measures to promote 
Beijing's work continuously. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Zhang Wenrui (1728 2429 3843): "Policemen </F>
Beaten, Police Cars Smashed While Performing a Mission in Shahe 
City, Hebei Province"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 5 November, a serious case of 
hindering the execution of a public mission occurred in the city 
of Shahe, in Hebei Province. The procuratorial officers 
performing this mission were besieged for nine hours and were 
beaten, while eight police cars were smashed. 
  At around 1700 on the afternoon of 5 November 1993, a team 
of 
10 officers from Handan's Wuan People's Procuratorate in Hebei 
traveled in three police cars to Shahe, Xingtai to arrest the 
accused, Hao Benliang, according to law and to search his house. 
Hao Benliang was the deputy director and accountant of a 
private ore-dressing plant in Wuan's Shimen village. In doing 
business with Hao Xiangxian, a Shimen villager who was also 
director of the ore- dressing plant, Hao Beiliang's involvement 
in tax evasion was affirmed. Hao Xiangxian was arrested on 1 
November, but Hao Benliang escaped. 
  The officers of the Wuan People's Procuratorate searched Hao 
Benliang's house in accordance with legal procedures, finding 
some bills and 12,000 yuan in cash. At that moment, Hao 
Benliang's son threatened the officers with two knives. Hao's 
daughter tore up the bills and cash that had been discovered, 
which made it difficult for the search to proceed. The Wuan 
procuratorial officers decided to leave. Hao's wife, son, and 
daughter stopped them and smashed two police cars, which further 
caused a further deterioration in the situation. The 
procuratorial officers then decided to take Hao's wife to the 
office of the Wuan People's Procuratorate. 
  At 1830, a police car and four policemen were besieged by 
villagers who were unaware of the truth. Hao Benliang's son 
pulled two policemen out of their car, beating, kicking, and 
handcuffing them. When the officers were taken to the courtyard 
of the village committee, Hao's son and son-in-law continued to 
beat the two officers until they broke their batons. At around 
2300, the two officers were gagged and blindfolded, and were 
driven into the wilderness, where they were beaten for four 
hours, resulting in serious injuries. 
  During this period, the leaders of the Wuan People's 
Procuratorate led more than 30 officers to the village in six 
police cars. The following announcement was made over loud 
speakers: "All villagers: Officers of the Wuan People's 
Procuratorate have come. Come out immediately!" At that moment, 
all the officers were besieged by hundreds of villagers. The 
head and political instructor of the village police station 
ordered that the road be blocked with a police car and with a 
bulldozer from a nearby ore- dressing plant. As he stopped the 
procuratorial officers, the six police cars were damaged. He 
aimed his pistol at the procuratorial officers and said: "All 
officers must get out and no one may leave!" The political 
commissar of the Shahe Public Security Bureau and a deputy chief 
of the city's procuratorate rushed to the scene. They decided to 
move the vehicles to the police station, which avoided further 
damages. 
  To quell the incident as early as possible, Hao Benliang's 
wife was sent back to the village and the two detained officers 
were released, thanks to the proposals made by the Shahe Public 
Security Bureau and Procuratorate. It was already 0700 the next 
morning. The released officers were sent immediately to the 
Handan Hospital for treatment. 
  Public opinion here paid close attention to this incident, 
believing that the practice of a defendant's relatives detaining 
and beating procuratorial officers, smashing cars, and inciting 
mass trouble constituted a serious crime of hindering a public 
mission, which had an adverse influence. In the struggle to 
sternly attack serious economic and other crime, it is 
absolutely necessary to seriously handle and punish people who 
are involved in inciting trouble.

<F P=106> [By reporter Mu Yajun (4476 0068 6511) "Deepen the Reform </F>
and Accelerate the Training of `Four Haves' Talented Personnel"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 14 December the "Yifulou" 
meeting room of Neimenggu University was brilliantly 
illuminated, in which Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous 
regional party committee; Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the 
autonomous regional party committee; and Zhao Zhihong, vice 
chairman of the autonomous regional people's government; 
listened to the report given by the university on its eight-year 
plan for striving to join in the state "211 project" by 
deepening the reform and accelerating its construction and 
development. These leading personnel also delivered their 
important speeches at the gathering. 
  Niemenggu University is the only key higher educational 
institution of the autonomous region. Over the past 36 years, 
it has turned out 15,118 graduates of various categories for the 
state and the autonomous region. In order to meet the challenge 
of world technical revolution and to accelerate the development 
of higher education in the country, the state put forward the 
enforcement of "211 project" in 1992, in which the state urged 
localities across the country to successfully foster 100 key 
universities and a large number of courses so as to enable the 
teaching quality and scientific research and management to reach 
the higher level both at home and broad as much aspossible in 
the beginning of next century. The autonomous regional party 
committee and people's government have attached great importance 
on this project and decided to support Neimenggu University to 
strive to join in the state "211 project." Over the past six 
months, the university has formulated its eight- year plan for 
construction and development by making careful preparations and 
conducting repeated studies and multiple appraisals in the 
fields of schooling scale, establishing specialized courses, and 
making more investments in school. In line with the plan, the 
university's student number will increase from more than 4,000 
at present to 7,000 by the beginning of next century and its 
specialized courses' number will increase from 27 at present to 
44. It will have 19 new courses for master-degree students and 
five new courses for doctor-degree students. Its graduate 
students' number will reach to 500 and its standards of key 
courses, teaching, and scientific research will reach to the 
advanced levels both at home and abroad. 
  After hearing the report Wang Qun fully acknowledged the 
work 
done by the university and delivered an important speech on the 
issue of how to operate a socialist university with Chinese 
characteristics and how to train transcentury talented 
personnel. He said: We should never shake our will in upholding 
the party's education line and the socialist schooling 
orientation and in training "four haves" new successors. At 
present we should earnestly and successfully study Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm our minds 
with the socialist theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and correct the weaker situation in the 
political work undertaken by the higher educational 
institutions. Efforts should be made to uphold the principle of 
scoring achievements in both political and professional work. 
He urged Neimenggu University to do a good job in taking the 
lead in this regard. Only by successfully studying Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, defining the 
schooling orientation, fostering targets, can the university do 
a better job in various fields for striving to join in the "211 
project" and lay a solid foundation for turning itself into an 
advanced socialist university with Chinese characteristics. 
  Wang Qun said: The task undertaken by the university in 
striving to join in the state "211 project" has been decided by 
the autonomous regional party committee and people's government. 
Thus, the university should only go ahead with the task without 
retrogression and only do a good job in the task without giving 
it up halfway. The task of joining in the state "211 project" 
requires a large amount of financial and material resources and 
represents a mission with hard work. Units from top to bottom 
should overcome difficulties together and do a good job in 
fulfilling the task because the autonomous regional party and 
people's government have made up their mind. Meanwhile, efforts 
should be made to uphold the spirit of seeking truth from facts 
and to refrain from separating the region's reality from the 
task. Just following the spirit of "the Chinese People's 
Anti-Japanese Military and Political College", Neimenggu 
University has scored marked achievements in improving its 
former poor schooling conditions. Such a spirit should be 
carried forward forever and we should never cast away the spirit 
even if our schooling conditions have become good in the future. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: Various work cannot be separated from 
the programs of reform and opening up and so does the university 
in joining in the state "211 project". It should dare to 
pioneer and to try in the task and change its concept at 
present. First of all it should change its concept of running 
the university under the guidance of the planned economy. The 
university should have all its work meet the needs of building 
the market economy and train talented personnel for next century 
suitable to the economic development of China and Inner 
Mongolia. At present the region's college graduates are many 
and those who are suitable to the needs of developing the 
socialist market economy are few. In order to deal with the 
shortage of talented personnel in the region, it is imperative 
to accelerate the reform among the higher educational 
institutions. Neimenggu University should dare to pioneer and 
to try in the reform. It should tap its internal potential and 
while seeking development, it should also tap the potential in 
setting up cooperative programs with outside places. It should 
not only operate its activities in an open way but also set up 
its training courses in outside places. In conducting the 
teaching of some specialized courses, the higher educational 
institutions should regard enterprises as reliable partners and 
set up cooperative programs with economic and productive 
departments. In conducting scientific research, these 
educational institutions may have these departments define their 
courses and provide funds so that both of them can commonly 
achieve development. They should place the programs of 
developing and manufacturing high scientific and technological 
products on the first position and also strive to win support 
from various social circles. They should correctly deal with 
the relation between institutions' development and reform, 
stability so as to apply stability to ensuring development and 
to regard reform as a motive force in promoting development. 
  Wang Zhan and Zhao Zhihong also delivered their speeches at 
the gathering.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Inherit and Develop Mao Zedong's Military </F>
Thinking--Marking Birth Centenary of Mao Zedong"] 
  [Text] The centenary of the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong, 
the beloved leader of all the nationalities of the people of 
China, the chief founder of our party, Army, and country, falls 
on 26 December this year. Recalling his brilliant achievements, 
which have gone down in history, officers and men of the whole 
Army, like the people of all the nationalities in China, are 
filled with great admiration for this great man of history. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist, a great proletarian 
revolutionary, strategist, and theorist as well as a great 
patriot and national hero of modern Chinese history. He 
achieved indelible historical feats in the founding and 
developing of our party and the People's Army, victory in the 
cause of liberation of the people of all the nationalities of 
China, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the 
development of the socialist cause in our country, to allow the 
Chinese nation to plant its feet firmly in the forest of the 
world of nations. The Chinese communists, with Comrade Mao 
Zedong as their chief representative, made theoretical 
generalizations on a series of experiences of long-term Chinese 
revolutionary practice with originality based on the basic 
tenets of Marxist and shaped into Mao Zedong Thought--scientific 
guiding ideas suitable to conditions in China. At the same 
time, Comrade Mao Zedong was a great proletarian strategist. In 
half a century, he led our party, people and Army in founding 
our great military cause that will shine through the ages. 
  The characteristic of the Chinese revolution was armed 
revolution against armed counterrevolution, the central task of 
the revolution was the seizure of political power with armed 
force, the major form of struggle was armed struggle, and the 
chief form of organization was the People's Army. The entirety 
of the theory and practice of our party during the whole period 
of the new democratic revolution was unfolded by centering 
around the core of revolutionary war. Inside our party, Comrade 
Mao Zedong was the first to see the importance and pressing 
nature of armed struggle, the first to indicate the road of 
establishing revolutionary bases, encircling the cities with the 
rural areas, as well as seizing political power with armed 
force, and he personally initiated the People's Army under the 
absolute leadership of the party with fresh-and-blood ties with 
the people. In the surging waves of Chinese revolutionary wars, 
Comrade Mao Zedong became our Army's wise commander-in-chief, 
formed strategic plans at headquarters, determined victories on 
the vast battlefields across China, and directed one campaign 
after another full of power and grandeur. From the struggle at 
Jinggangshan to the Long March, from the consolidation and 
development of the Northern Shaanxi Revolutionary Base Area to 
vanquishing the invasion by Japanese imperialism, from the War 
of Liberation and the decisive battle against 8 million 
Kuomintang troops to contending with a most powerful enemy on 
the Korean battleground, all these reflected his superb art of 
command marked by great proficiency. The duration of his 
command during the revolutionary wars, their scope, the 
complexity of situation, the splendor of the victories, and the 
far-reaching effects were all rare in the all-time history of 
war of all countries. Comrade Mao Zedong was the glory of the 
People's Army as well as the pride of the Chinese nation. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong was a great man, a famous military 
commander, as well as an outstanding military theorist. He 
combined the basic tenets of Marxist-Leninism with the specific 
practice of the Chinese revolutionary war and army building, 
scientifically summarized the Chinese revolutionary war and the 
precious experiences of our army building, critically absorbed 
the rational essences of all sorts of military theories from all 
eras and from all lands, concentrated the wisdom of the whole 
party and whole Army, and founded Mao Zedong military thinking. 
Mao Zedong military thinking on the building of a revolutionary 
army, people's war, and strategies and tactics characterized by 
flexibility and a scientific concept of war and methodology 
based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism have 
enriched and developed Marxist-Leninist military doctrine with a 
series of original theories that were shaped into a scientific 
system characterized by extensive and profound knowledge, and 
this became a brilliant, important part of Mao Zedong Thought. 
Especially in the arena of building a people's army, Comrade Mao 
Zedong systematically formed a revolutionary army with its main 
factor being peasants, and the question on how should the army 
be built into a new-type people's army which is proletarian in 
nature and has strict discipline, while maintaining close ties 
with the people. He stipulated that serving the people heart 
and soul should be the sole purpose of the People's Army; 
determined the principle of the party commanding the gun, but 
not otherwise; formulated the Three Main Rules of Discipline and 
the Eight Points for Attention; stressed the implementation of 
democracy in the three main fields, namely political, economic 
and military democracy at the company level; implemented the 
principle of unity between officers and men, unity between the 
Army and the people, and disintegrating enemy forces; and set 
out and summarized a whole range of principles and methods of 
political work for the Army. The correctness of all these 
theories and principles in building a new-type people's army had 
been fully proved in the long-term practice of the Chinese 
revolution and the building of the People's Army. By drawing a 
lesson from China being bullied by various powers during its 
modern and contemporary history, which resulted from 
impoverishment and being weak, Comrade Mao Zedong set out, in 
the wake of the PRC's founding, the guiding thinking of 
strengthening defense and building a powerful modern 
revolutionary armed force, and he made the important decision on 
developing modern defense science and technology through self- 
reliance, thus effectively insuring China's independence and 
peaceful socialist construction. 
  Mao Zedong's military thinking took deep root in the fertile 
soil of the practice of Chinese revolutionary war and the 
building of our Army. It originated from military practice, 
while it was tested and developed in giving guidance to military 
practice. The half-century of progress in our Army's struggles 
give evidence to the fact that Mao Zedong military thinking has 
correctly answered and resolved a series of important issues on 
why we must carry out a revolutionary war, whom we should rely 
on in fighting a revolutionary war, and how we can win that 
war, while profoundly revealing the basic law that governs 
China's revolutionary war and building of the People's Army, and 
that this has scientific quality and progressiveness beyond a 
doubt. With the changing of the times, great progress has been 
made in science, technology, weaponry, and equipment, and many 
characteristics different from the past have surfaced in modern 
warfare along with great changes in the means, tactics, and ways 
of war. Nevertheless, the basic law of war has not changed, nor 
has the nature of our Army as a people's army; Mao Zedong's 
basic principles on building a people's army, the concept of 
people's war, and strategies and principles, especially his 
military dialectics, continue to have universal guiding 
significance, and this is a mighty ideological weapon for making 
preparations for future wars against aggression. 
  Mao Zedong Thought is an ever-developing theoretical system. 
It was none other than Comrade Deng Xiaoping who became an 
outstanding representative and brilliant model in pushing Mao 
Zedong Thought to a new realm and new heights. As an important 
member of our party's first-generation collective leadership, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping participated in the founding of Mao Zedong 
Thought; furthermore, as the core of the party's 
second-generation collective leadership, he has led the Chinese 
people in the great practice of reform, opening up, and 
modernization, concentrated the wisdom of the whole party, 
enriched and developed Mao Zedong Thought, initiated the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and realized 
the second historical leap of Marxist basic tenets combining 
with China's concrete practice. In the application and 
development of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, his outstanding 
political wisdom, and Marxist spirit of blazing new trails have 
been given full play. As the chief architect of China's reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
has personally planned for and led our Army in building a 
revolutionary, regular, and modern army. He has adhered to and 
inherited the most fundamental essence of Mao Zedong's military 
thinking, set out our Army's purpose of serving the people heart 
and soul, and brought forward our Army's glorious traditions and 
"five kinds of revolutionary spirit" to always maintain our 
army's political color. At the same time, with extremely great 
political boldness and theoretical courage, he set out the 
guiding idea for army building and the need for implementing 
strategic change through profoundly analyzing the world 
strategic situation today, the characteristics of modern 
warfare, China's national conditions, and the Army's actual 
conditions. He indicated that our Army building must take 
modernization as the center, strengthen quality building, and 
take the road of picked troops with Chinese characteristics, 
while building our Army into a powerful, modern, regular, 
revolutionary army. He stressed the need to augment scientific 
research and improve weaponry and equipment, as well as elevate 
education and training to a strategic position, work hard to 
improve cadres' ability in commanding modern warfare, and bring 
up qualified people who are able to fight a war and pursue 
socialist construction, namely training people for both military 
and civilian jobs in a big way. He stressed the need to 
complete and perfect rules and regulations, be strict with 
discipline, and adhere to strictly running the Army and the need 
to augment logistics building to meet the demand of the new 
situation and the needs of modern warfare. He has called for 
exerting efforts to make cadres more revolutionary, younger in 
average, better educated and more professionalized; to augment 
and improve ideological and political work; continuously push 
the building of spiritual civilization in the army; bring up 
soldiers with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a better 
educational background, and a high sense of discipline; and so 
forth. All this has shaped into Deng Xiaoping's thinking on 
army building for the new period sharply marked with the 
characteristics of the times. This thinking has answered and 
resolved, with originality, a series of basic issues in theory 
and practice about our army building during the new period, and 
is the fundamental grounds and guiding thinking for our army 
building and reform. Without Mao Zedong military thinking, there 
would not have been the growth of the People's Army and the 
victorious development of the people's revolutionary wars. 
Likewise, without Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building 
during the new period, there would not have been the great 
accomplishments of our army reform and building today. To 
firmly arm the whole Army with Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army 
building during the new period is basic insurance for 
victoriously advancing along the road of building a modern army 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  Carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the 
future, 
the third-generation collective leadership of the Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has held aloft 
the banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and has 
continuously pushed forward China's great cause of reform, 
opening up, and modernization. The Central Military Commission 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as chairman has formulated military 
strategic principles for our Army during the new period based on 
Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new period 
and has set out the general requirement of "being politically 
eligible, skillful in military affairs, strict with discipline, 
and effective with logistics," and has drawn up a series of 
important decision on augmenting the building of a more 
revolutionary, modern and regular Army. The whole Army, from 
the top down, has brought forward our party's fine traditions in 
a big way, united as one, worked hard, and continuously made new 
progress in military affairs, political work, and logistics and 
defense scientific research in the course of reform. 
  The century from the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong has been 
one 
of earth-shaking changes which have taken place in China and the 
world. The most significant commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong 
is to inherit and develop Mao Zedong military thinking and forge 
ahead along the broad path of building a modern army with 
Chinese characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It 
is necessary for us to consciously meet the requirements set out 
by the Central Committee and Central Military Commission with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, work hard to arm our thinking 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, continuously enhance our resolution in 
"adhering to the party basic line without wavering for a hundred 
years," and enthusiastically support various reforms with 
building the socialist market economic structure as the goal. 
It is imperative to firmly implement our Army's military 
strategic principles for the new period, continuously augment 
the Army's quality building, and improve the Army's combat 
effectiveness in a comprehensive way to provide reliable 
security insurance for reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization. It is necessary to augment the Army's political 
and ideological building in a big way and take the lead in 
building socialist spiritual civilization in the whole society. 
Comrades of the whole Army, let us closely unite around the 
Central Committee and Central Military Commission with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core, go all out in doing substantial work, 
exert great efforts to make the country strong, and work hard 
together with the people of the whole country in building and 
defending a prosperous, powerful, democratic, and civilized 
socialist country while advancing toward the 21st century full 
of confidence!

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hong (0491 4767): "Liu Zhongli Stresses </F>
Once Again the Need To Handle Correctly Relations Between 
Macroeconomic Control and Market Economy in Order To Push 
Forward Financial, Taxation Reform"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese 
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli pointed out today that correct 
handling of relations between strengthening macroeconomic 
control and giving play to market roles is proving to be a major 
issue, which already has cropped up or probably will emerge in 
our financial and taxation work and in the related reform. 
  This was the second time within a single month that Liu 
Zhongli had touched this subject at national meetings on 
financial affairs. 
  At the annual meeting of the China Institute for Financial 
Studies and the 11th session of the national symposium on 
financial theory, as well as at the national work meeting on 
financial and scientific research -- both of which are in 
session in Beijing -- Liu Zhongli indicated: To carry out 
financial and taxation work and the related reform, we should 
not set the efforts to strengthen macroeconomic control against 
the efforts to bring the role of market mechanism into full 
play; instead, we should seek unity between the two. 
  He said: On the one hand, while pushing forward reforms in 
the fields of finance, taxation, accounting, and the management 
of state assets, we should give full play to the role of the 
market mechanism and should create conditions for facilitating 
fair competition among main market bodies -- selecting the 
superior and eliminating the inferior, while optimizing the 
disposition of resources. On the other hand, we still need to 
make use of financial policies, and of such means as budgeting 
and taxation to step up our control, management, and supervision 
over the market. Following the transformation of government 
functions, in particular, financial and monetary sectors will 
become two major pillars for the state in its effort to exercise 
macroeconomic regulation and control. By then, financial 
departments should focus their work on regulating the economic 
structure and social distribution through budgeting and 
taxation, and on bringing about a basic balance in the total 
social supply and demand, straightening out the mistakes of the 
market and making up for its insufficiencies through the 
well-coordinated use of both currency and financial policies. 
  Liu Zhongli added: Of course, the focus of work varies at 
different work stages. To adapt ourselves to different 
realities, we sometimes need to place more stress on the role of 
the market, and sometimes on macroeconomic control and 
regulation by the state. What we should not do, however, is to 
stress the importance of one to the neglect of the other.

Jian Xiu (2799 3005 0208): "Several Problems in Strengthening 
Macroeconomic Regulation and Control"] 
  [Text] Does socialist market economy need macroeconomic 
regulation and control? How to carry out macroeconomic 
regulation and control? People do not have completely identical 
viewpoints on these questions. Hence, many of the problems 
occurring in the current macroeconomic management have something 
to do with this situation. 
<H5>  I. The Necessity of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H5>
  History and reality prove that market economy needs 
macroeconomic regulation and control. Capitalist market economy 
has existed for several hundred years. So has macroeconomic 
regulation and control, though it varies in scope and degree. 
What needs our special emphasis is that macroeconomic 
regulation and control in capitalist market economy has not 
weakened, instead it has become stronger and stronger as history 
has developed to its present stage. The newly emerging 
industrial countries since World War II lay greater emphasis on 
and pay more attention to the role of macroeconomic regulation 
and control than the old-line capitalist countries, and have 
consequently achieved remarkable results. The cause lies in 
several points: 1) The problem of overall economic balance, 
that is, the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply; 2) the problem of big economic structures such as the 
proportion between industry and agriculture, the proportion 
between various industrial departments, the relationship between 
industry and trade, and the relationship between production 
development and construction of infrastructure; 3) the problem 
of competition on an equal basis, that is, opposing monopoly and 
maintaining fair competition on an equal footing; 4) the problem 
of the relationship between equality and efficiency, that is, 
maintaining social justice and equality and preventing 
over-polarization while ensuring a certain efficiency; 5) the 
problem of public services or social consumption, such as basic 
public utilities, elementary education, public health and 
national defense and security; 6) the problem of the natural and 
social environment in economic development, such as the 
ecological balance, resource protection, environmental 
protection, and the protection of citizens' lives and property. 
The solution to all these problems depends mainly on the 
government's macroeconomic regulation and control rather than 
mainly or completely on the spontaneous acts of enterprises and 
individuals under the influence of the market mechanism. It is 
a general law that market economy needs macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and socialist market economy is no exception. 
  Why should market economy pay attention to and strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control under the condition of 
socialism? This is determined by its own characteristics. 
First, public economy, especially state-owned economy, plays a 
leading role in social economy. It needs to concentrate all 
social forces to carry out overall, major economic construction 
that concerns the national economy. This not only requires the 
strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, but also 
makes it possible to carry out macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Second, it is to eliminate poverty and move toward 
prosperity together. Being the inherent requirement of the 
socialist system, it sets a higher demand for the relationship 
between efficiency and equality than in other countries that 
practice market economy. Consequently it will depend more on 
macroeconomic regulation and control over the state's policy for 
income distribution to solve this problem. Third, the 
transition from a highly centralized planned economy to a 
socialist market economy. It is a long process of exploration. 
It is not possible to depend solely on decentralizing powers to 
enterprises to achieve this aim. It should depend on 
macroeconomic regulation and control and powerful administrative 
interference by the government. Fourth, in the process of 
modernization from a big agricultural country which depends on 
its 800 million peasants to feed the nation, it is neither 
possible nor necessary for us to follow the old road of 
long-term development taken by countries in Europe or America. 
Instead, we should take a quicker road of development with 
Chinese characteristics. This requires that the government play 
a greater and more forceful role. 
<H3>  II. The Content and Scope of Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control </H3>
  Planning, finance and banking are the three important 
aspects 
of macroeconomic regulation and control by the state in market 
economy. 
  1. Planning. Capitalist countries also make plans. However, 
plans made by different countries vary in form and scope. Some 
newly emerging industrial countries practice that type of 
economy which attaches great importance to planning, with the 
government playing a guiding role. What we want to do in the 
practice of market economy is to give up the old system of 
planned economy thoroughly. But it is by no means the case that 
planning is not needed. We need to replace highly centralized 
mandatory planning with guidance and policy-oriented planning. 
The stress of the state plan lies in determining the strategic 
goals for the national economy and social development in a 
rational way, doing a good job in economic development 
forecasts, control over total supply and demand as well as 
programing of major structures and layout of productive forces, 
focusing necessary financial and material resources to carry out 
major construction, and using economic levers comprehensively to 
promote the long-term, stable and coordinated growth of the 
national economy. Practice has proved that this kind of 
planning is highly necessary and workable. 
  2. Finance. It is the main means of state macroeconomic 
regulation and control. By means of financial revenue, the 
state can regulate the aggregate social supply and demand. It 
can also regulate the economic structure, regional structure and 
social distribution and redistribution. At present, the 
principal problems in our finance are: Revenue levying is not 
efficient, while its payment is far from sufficient. There have 
been great losses in taxes. The relationship between central 
finance and local finance has not been straightened out. The 
growth of central financial revenue lags far behind that of the 
national economy, being unable to meet the needs of state 
macroeconomic regulation and control. In expenditure, economic 
expenditure is not clearly separated from construction 
expenditure, with each crowding out the other. Consequently the 
efficiency of utilization is low. To solve these problems, it 
is necessary to practice a unified taxation system as well as 
the system whereby enterprises pay tax plus a percentage of 
profits, to strengthen supervision of tax collection by law, to 
practice the system of tax sharing and to increase the 
proportion of tax revenue going to the central government. It 
is also necessary to produce dual budgets and handle well the 
relationship between feeding the people and construction. What 
needs pointing out especially is that the state power of 
financial control and its use is the material basis for the 
realization of macroeconomic regulation and control. Power of 
financial control chiefly refers to the proportion of national 
revenue in the GNP and the proportion of central revenue in the 
GNP. Since the reform and opening up to the world these two 
proportions have decreased quickly. The proportion of central 
revenue has decreased by a large margin. Consequently it makes 
it difficult for state macroeconomic regulation and control to 
achieve good results due to the loss of effective financial 
support. It also makes it difficult to carry out a lot of 
reform measures (including price, wage, and other reforms) 
smoothly and in a timely manner due to the lack of financial 
backup. Some people of insight in the West have long since 
discovered that China is a country with the most diverse 
financial resources and the weakest central finance control 
capacity in the world. It is because of a solid financial basis 
that those Western countries that practice market economy, like 
the United States and Japan, can more effectively realize 
government macroeconomic regulation and control. This point is 
worth our learning. 
  3. Banking. It is the economic means and measure for state 
macroeconomic regulation and control. The government controls 
the overall supply and demand for currency, the total scale of 
credit investment and the aggregate import and export amounts by 
way of monetary policies and measures such as issuance of basic 
currency, credit loans, interest rates and exchange rates. At 
the same time it affects the microbehavior of enterprises. At 
present, the main problems existing in our banking sector are: 
The central bank, with no independence or definite functions, 
finds it difficult to establish its authority; the coexistence 
of the policy-oriented function and business-oriented function 
in specialized banks leads to inaccurate action; there is too 
much intervention in local banks by governments at various 
levels; the dual exchange rate system confuses import and export 
trade. The ways to solve them are: Establish an independent, 
authoritative central bank as soon as possible; organize and 
establish state policy-oriented banks; change specialized banks 
into real commercial banks; limit illegal intervention in banks 
by local government with laws and polices; change the exchange 
rate system and gradually practice the system of a free exchange 
rate. What needs pointing out in particular is that the 
confusion that has occurred in the present monetary system has a 
lot to do with the above-mentioned problems. Moreover, it also 
accounts for the fact that banks and monetary institutions get 
involved directly or indirectly in the purchase and sale of 
shares and securities, real estate business and non-monetary 
profit-making activities. There are two types of relationship 
between banking and the securities sector. One is the American 
model, that is, banks and securities are established separately. 
The other is the West European type, that is, banks can run 
securities business at the same time. As for the relationship 
between banks and enterprises, there are three types. One is 
the American type, that is, banks are strictly separated from 
enterprises. Neither can hold shares in the other. Another is 
the German type, that is, banks can hold shares in enterprises, 
but not the other way round. Still another is the Japanese 
type, that is, both enterprises and banks can be mutual 
shareholders. Each type has its own merits and demerits. As 
there are no definite responsibilities or relationship between 
the central bank and specialized banks and between 
policy-oriented banks and commercial banks in our country and 
the laws concerning banking institutions and their operations 
are not perfect, for a certain period of time banks and monetary 
institutions should be forbidden to get involved in securities 
exchange and other activities of non- monetary investment and 
management. Otherwise, it will be really difficult to establish 
normal order in the monetary market. 
  The contents of macroeconomic regulation and control in 
socialist market economy also include industrial policy, price 
management, infrastructure construction, state asset management, 
etc. Through the formulation of industrial policies, the state 
provides enterprises with guidance in the choice of industries 
for investment, quickens industrial adjustment and replacement 
and promotes the upgrading and modernization of the industrial 
structure. Price management is one of the important functions 
of the government. Price reform should be carried out in order 
and step by step under government control, especially when price 
relationships are not yet straightened out. Even later, after 
price relationships are basically straightened out, prices of 
some important products concerning the national economy and the 
people's livelihood should be controlled directly by the state. 
As for the construction of large-scale infrastructure, major 
projects like communications hubs and city public utilities, 
which require big investment with long construction periods and 
low profit, and even losses, should mainly depend on investment 
from the government. State assets need government management all 
the more. 
<H3>  III. Problems in the Present Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control </H3>
  At present, the main factors affecting the efficiency of our 
macroeconomic regulation and control are: 1) The basic numbers 
are not clear. There exists the phenomenon of "holding 
something back," that is, no matter whether it is industrial 
output value, investment scale, financial revenue, or enterprise 
or personal income, a rather big leeway is left when reporting 
it to the higher authorities. And there exists another 
phenomenon in undeveloped areas, that is, targets, output, 
production value, revenue etc. are exaggerated; they are 
"inflated" to varying degrees. It is not a bad thing for 
localities, enterprises and individuals to store wealth. 
However, the problem is that the state has no idea how big the 
leeway left by the localities is, how much falsity there is in 
their reports and how large the margin is between the state 
statistics and the actual figures. It is easy to make mistakes 
in macro-decisionmaking because of unclear base numbers and 
judgments based on unreliable data. 2) The means for 
macroeconomic regulation and control are not perfect and 
effective. The ways and means of economic management are many, 
but few are really effective. Scale management is still one of 
the chief means we now use to control aggregate quantities in 
society. However, scale limits have been broken time and again 
both in investment in fixed assets and in credit. According to 
estimates by people in financial circles, actual credit loans 
completed are about one-fourth higher than the reported figure. 
The over-scale investment and low standard in duplicate 
construction of quite a number of localities directly affect the 
growth of the overall efficiency of the national economy. It is 
difficult to realize the efficiency of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control because we have not found a means for 
scale management that meets the demands of market economy. 3) 
The power and responsibilities of both the central and local 
governments are not definite; neither is there any clear 
division of work between them. The present situation is that 
the lower the administrative level, the greater its ability to 
guide and control the economy, whereas the higher the 
administrative level, the weaker its ability to guide and 
control. 4) Orders are not obeyed nor prohibitions observed. 
There is a saying: The experience of success gained by local 
authorities is: "Do not do whatever the central government asks 
you to do and do whatever it asks you not to do." If things go 
on like this, the central government will lose its authority 
while local governments go their own way. It will be impossible 
to give full play to the advantage put forward by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, that is: "Socialism focuses its strength to do big 
things." It also directly affects the overall efficiency of the 
national economy. To deal with the above- mentioned problems, 
emphasis should be laid on doing a good job in the construction 
of the following four systems: 
  First, build a scientific, national economic statistics 
monitoring system that meets the needs of the healthy 
development of market economy, strengthen macromonitoring of 
basic statistics work and improve the scientific reliability and 
accuracy of statistics monitoring in order to reduce errors in 
macro-decisionmaking. 
  Second, build a sound macroeconomic regulation and control 
system that meets the needs of the development of socialist 
market economy. The various economic levers should be adjusted 
in accordance with the complexity and particularity of the 
targets of regulation during the transition of the economic 
system so as to ensure timely, appropriate and effective 
adjustment. Especially at present, we should intensify the 
application of financial means. As the present financial system 
is far behind this need, the step of reforming the financial 
system should be quickened. 
  Third, establish and perfect as soon as possible a 
responsibility-power division system, divide the financial power 
and administrative power reasonably between the central and 
local governments, and set a definite division of work and 
responsibilities so that each exercises its function to do a 
good job in whatever it should take care of. 
  Fourth, speed up the establishment of a system to guarantee 
effective implementation of the macropolicies, strengthen the 
construction of a legislative and law-enforcement contingent, 
strengthen supervision, and administer according to law so as to 
maintain the inviolability of state policies and regulations and 
thoroughly change the situation in which laws are neither 
observed nor seriously enforced.

<F P=106> [Article by Geng Yuxin: "Old Subject -- New Content"] </F>
  [Text] As we look back on the old year and ahead to the new 
and keep the world in view, we invariably feel compelled to make 
various comments. What is the main topic of conversation in 
today's China? Economics. 
  China's economy has been developing by leaps and bounds 
since 
late 1978 when the government decided to shift the focus of its 
work on to economic construction. Today, as the situation 
develops and the world changes, new content has been added to 
the old topic. What exactly is the new content? 
  Firstly, following 15 years of practice and exploration, 
China's economic structural reform is finally proceeding under a 
clear objective model -- the socialist market economic 
structure. The recent decision of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
outlines a blueprint for the new structure. The basic framework 
of the blueprint consists of the following five links: 
  -- A modern enterprise system based mainly on public 
ownership, and which allows the common development of diverse 
economic sectors and complies with the requirements of a market 
economy; 
  -- A unified national market system which is linked to the 
international market and which allows free exchange of various 
factors such as commodities and productive forces; 
  -- A macro-economic control system centered on economic and 
legal means and necessary administrative measures; 
  -- An income distribution system based mainly on the 
principle of "to each according to his work", and which gives 
priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account; and 
  -- A multi-tiered social security system under which 
essential daily necessities are provided to both urban and rural 
residents. 
  This year, efforts will be made to increase the dynamics of 
reform in these areas, press ahead with overall reform and 
record breakthroughs in key areas. If certain factors in past 
reforms were as analogically unclear, as if we were "groping 
forward by feeling for stones to cross a river", then today we 
have a clear view of the "opposite bank" and, indeed, have 
already boarded a "ferry boat". 
  Secondly, further invigorating enterprises, controlling the 
balance between aggregate supply and demand and implementing 
industrial policies have brought about even brighter prospects 
for us to launch the national economy into an orbit of 
sustained, rapid and healthy development. 
  The fact that reform is also revolutionary and capable of 
liberating productive forces has long been borne out in 
practice. However, during the many years of economic 
development, we have frequently faced threats and interference 
from various factors such as "overheating", imbalance, 
inflation, chaos and major fluctuations. 
  In 1993, China was once again subjected to such threats as 
its economy entered a second year of rapid growth. Fortunately, 
a series of banking control measures resolutely adopted by the 
government almost immediately proved effective. Only then did 
we appropriately cool the overheated economy, overcome chaotic 
phenomenon and steadily bring about a second consecutive year 
with a 13 percent rise in economic growth. The total volume of 
imports and exports and the amount of introduced foreign capital 
continued to increase by a large margin. These experiences 
alone prove that so long as correct macro-control measures are 
adopted to constantly maintain a balance, it is possible to 
avoid major fluctuations and wide-ranging readjustments that 
given situations demand. Experts predict that in order to 
ensure favorable conditions for the adoption of many important 
reform measures, it is appropriate to fix the economic growth 
rate at around 9 percent. 
  Thirdly, since the end of the world pattern characterized by 
bipolar political and military confrontation, the economy has 
played an increasingly remarkable role in international 
relationships. Although hegemonism and power politics continue 
to exist, a multi- polar pattern taken shape against a 
background of a contest of economic strength is developing, and 
the principle of placing priority on the economy has become a 
inevitable development trend in international exchanges. At a 
time when many parts of the world are in the grips of economic 
recession, a dynamic Asia, especially a China developing at the 
fastest pace, has attracted extensive attention from the 
international community, and has become the target in the shift 
in the strategic focus of international economics. Numerous 
countries have expressed great interest in China's vast market 
and attractive investment environment, and one after another 
have readjusted their policies toward China. A new "China 
craze" has emerged. 
  The recent Sino-US Summit held during the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Conference in Seattle reaffirmed the 
importance of developing bilateral relations [on] the basis of 
the three joint communiques, and the necessity to take the lead 
in restoring high- level contacts, as a welcoming move. The 
summit is expected to improve the cool Sino-US relationship, and 
proceed to bring about a turn in world peace development. 
Developing economic exchanges is essential for both sides, and 
is in no way dependent upon only one side. Such exchanges 
should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and not 
considered as a favor from one side to the other. The foundation 
for exchanges and cooperation is common interest, not identical 
ideological and social systems. Therefore, seeking common 
ground while reserving differences, and guaranteeing equality 
and mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs are vitally important to improving the relationship. 
  We wish that friendship and cooperation between China and 
various countries around the world will develop smoothly and 
with greater results on the basis of the Five Principles of 
Peaceful Coexistence in the coming new year.

"Beijing Leadership Is Worried About Great Risk Resulting From 
High-Speed Development, and Instructs Various Localities Not To 
Overestimate the Risk-Enduring Capacity of the Public"] 
  [Text] Facing the present situation in which major reform 
measures are expected to be put into effect one after another in 
the new year, the Beijing leadership has already been aware of 
the possible "high risks" resulting from efforts to speed up 
reform and development. Recently, the central authorities 
issued a document to all localities, instructing the leaders not 
to overestimate the "risk-enduring capacity" of the public. At 
a time when reform measures are being announced, all localities 
are required to draw up emergency measures, "which may look 
casual outwardly but strict inwardly," which aim at dealing with 
shocks and contingencies which may break out any time. The 
"Emergency Center" of the Central Bank is also "ready for 
battle," preparing to cope with any unexpected changes in the 
exchange market. 
  Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, 
admitted that the panic purchases of grain in parts of China 
since last November have served to prepare the public for future 
price rises. He claimed that reform is not aimed at bringing 
about a general rise in commodity prices, and the state will 
take steps to stabilize prices. 
  Relevant sources have disclosed that China's four major 
specialized banks, namely the Bank of China, the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and 
the People's Construction Bank of China, has sent urgent cables 
to their branches in all parts of the country, summoning 
directors of all provincial- and regional-level branches to 
attend a meeting in Beijing next week to discuss issues 
concerning deepening reform and the anti-corruption struggle. 
It has been learned that the major agenda of the meeting for 
branch heads will be the possible impact produced by the 
unification of the existing dual rate system of renminbi, as 
well as the commercialization of specialized banks. 
  It has been noted that the Beijing leadership has showed 
concern over the possible impact produced by the announcement of 
a series of reform measures this year, and is also plagued by 
unsatisfactory results of the anticorruption struggle which was 
launched at an early time, for fear that all these may serve to 
further impair the reputation of the government. In order to 
prevent "a fine start and poor finish" for the anticorruption 
campaign, the central authorities recently sent instructions to 
all localities, warning that though they can tune down their 
propaganda pitch a little, no localities are allowed to claim to 
have attained "accomplishments at the present stage" of the 
anti-corruption campaign, for only the CPC Central Commission 
for Discipline Inspection has the right to say so. At present, 
the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is carrying 
out intensive investigations into several "super-large cases," 
yet at a very slow pace. The leadership cherishes the hope that 
the cracking of several major cases can set off another upsurge 
of the anti-corruption struggle and show all nationalities the 
determination of the central authorities. 
<H3>  The Central Bank Gets Prepared for Unexpected Changes, and 
Sets the Bottom Line of the Exchange Rate at 10 to the Dollar </H3>
  Sources have revealed that before it scrapped the dual-rate 
currency system, the People's Bank of China (the central bank) 
made full preparations for possible big ups and downs in the 
exchange market when it began to float the yuan. Although 
nothing serious happened during the first three days, the 
24-hour emergency center (the duty room) still "maintains its 
combat readiness." It has been learned that the leadership has 
set the bottom line of the renminbi exchange rate at 10 to the 
dollar, and once the exchange rate drops to this level, the bank 
will strive to stabilize the rate with all necessary measures, 
including selling U.S. dollars and resuming a number of 
administrative methods previously in use. 
  Predictions show that the exchange rate of renminbi will 
remain relatively stable before the Chinese New Year, mainly 
because most foreign businessmen stationed in Beijing have 
returned to their own countries for the Christmas holidays and 
enterprise demands for foreign exchange are also relatively low. 
After the Chinese New Year, however, along with the "rise of 
temperature" of the entire economy, the exchange rate of 
renminbi will go through real tests. 
  In recent days, an apparent rise has been registered in 
Beijing's commodity prices; imported electric home appliances, 
in particular, are often in short supply. Stories have it that 
shortly after an advertisement for Sony brand electric home 
appliances was published on the newspaper, citizens rushing to 
the shop were surprise to find an increase of more than 10 
percent over the advertised price; while prices of ordinary 
Japan-made hi-fis also went up from over 4,000 yuan to over 
5,000 yuan, registering an increase of more than 20 percent. 
Prices of grain, oil, and some basic consumer goods remain 
relative stable under state control. 
  It has been learned that when the policy of unifying dual 
exchange rate was first announced, Foreign Exchange Certificates 
(FEC) traded in Beijing at 1 to the yuan; though the rate later 
rose to 1 to 1.45 yuan, FEC dropped again yesterday to 1 to 1.25 
yuan. In the black market, people only want to buy, they do not 
sell, U.S. dollars, for most people intend to buy U.S. dollars 
for future use. The black market rate generally remains at 
around 8.68 to the dollar in a recent period, similar to the 
state swap rate. In Harbin City, center of Sino-Russian trade, 
however, people are trading the yuan at 9 to the dollar. Rates 
in coastal port cities, like Yantai and Weihai, are higher that 
those in inland areas.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "As the Unified </F>
Exchange Rate Increases the Cost of Foreign Debts, the Central 
Government Adopts Measures To Help Localities Make Repayments"] 
  [Text] The unification of the two exchange rates has 
devalued the renminbi by 33 percent. This has increased the 
cost of local governments in paying foreign debts and created a 
new burden. It is disclosed that according to a State Council 
decision, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of 
Finance will coordinate with the planning commissions of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government in jointly solving this issue. The 
Ministry of Finance will also undertake some of the local 
governments' foreign debts to help them repay part of their 
debts. 
  In an interview with this reporter yesterday, Tao Liming, 
deputy director of the International Monetary and Financial 
Institute of the Bank of China, said: The central government 
has noticed that, in the years between the Seventh Five-Year 
Plan (1986-1990) and the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), some 
of the foreign debts contracted by the local governments were 
calculated at the official rate of less than 4 yuan or 5.9 yuan 
[figures as published] to the U.S. dollar. Now that the 
renminbi has been devalued following the unification of the two 
exchange rates, which means foreign debts should be calculated 
at the new rate of 8.7 yuan to the dollar, the cost and burden 
of the local governments will suddenly increase if they exchange 
renminbi for the dollar at a designated bank for the repayment 
of foreign debts. 
  Some time ago, a considerable proportion of the foreign 
debts 
incurred by the local governments was invested in electricity, 
communications, and water conservation projects for agricultural 
use. When these projects are completed and go into operation, 
the country as a whole will benefit. 
  Officials from Chengdu as well as Guizhou, Yunnan, and other 
provinces told this reporter: In the past dozen years or so, 
the localities have joined in many large construction projects, 
such as railways, power stations, and water conservation 
projects, and have borrowed money to finance these projects. 
Now that the exchange rates are unified, they are anxious to 
find ways to deal with the substantial increase in the cost of 
foreign debts. 
  Tao said that by a decision of the State Council, the State 
Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate 
with the planning commissions of various provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities directly under the central 
government in helping the local government solve this new issue. 
  By the end of 1992, China's foreign debts came to $69.3 
billion. At the National People's Congress meeting last March, 
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said China would borrow 26.9 
billion yuan in new foreign debts (amounting to $4.56 billion at 
5.9 yuan to the dollar). The servicing of foreign debts will 
hit a peak this year and the next. But a relevant department 
said that China has a good reputation in repaying foreign debts. 
He said: In a bid to stabilize the exchange rate of renminbi 
and further boost monetary reform, Chinese monetary authorities 
plan to open a renminbi futures business. Tao did not elaborate 
specific measures, such as when this will open. 
  Tao also said yesterday that, following the unification of 
the exchange rates, the exchange rate of renminbi in mainland 
cities have been basically stable in the past few days. He 
added: The Chinese monetary and financial departments have made 
ample preparations for the unification of renminbi exchange 
rates on 1 January 1994. 
  For example, starting in early 1993, the authorities 
intentionally liberalized business by calculating the settlement 
of foreign trade exchange according to the swap price. By the 
end of last year, some 80 percent of imports and exports by 
mainland enterprises, labor export, and exchange transactions 
between enterprises was calculated according to the swap price. 
When the basic conditions for monetary reform were ripe, China 
announced the unification of exchange rates on 1 January and the 
rate has been basically stable since then. 
  According to Tao, foreign debts contracted by the central 
and 
local governments in the future will still be controlled by the 
State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control.

<F P=106> [Report by Jin Hongman (6855 1738 5585): "Total Import and </F>
Export Volume of Five Special Economic Zones Exceeds $21.6 
Billion in First 10 Months of This Year"] 
  [Text] Customs statistics show that the total 
import-export volume of China's five major special economic 
zones [SEZ] amounted to $21.66 billion for the period from 
January to October this year, an increase of 16.1 percent over 
the corresponding period last year (all comparisons made below 
apply to the same time span of the year). As far as this is 
concerned, the export volume was $10.17 billion, an increase of 
6.4 percent, and this accounted for 14.7 percent of the 
country's total export volume; whereas the import volume totaled 
$11.49 billion, an increase of 26.2 percent, accounting for 15 
percent of the country's total import volume. 
  With each SEZ considered separately, all the five major 
SEZ's 
have witnessed a growth in both imports and exports. The 
Shenzhen SEZ's export volume totaled $5.4 billion, an increase 
of 4.2 percent; while its import volume totaled $5.4 billion, an 
increase of 11.3 percent. Thus Shenzhen's export and import 
volumes was 53.1 and 47 percent of total import-export volume 
respectively. The Shantou SEZ's export volume totaled $1.27 
billion, an increase of 1.5 percent; while its import volume 
totaled $2.01 billion, an increase of 75.2 percent. The Xiamen 
SEZ registered a more rapid growth in the export volume, which 
increased by 18.7 percent to reach $1.61 billion; while its 
import volume increased by 19.6 percent to reach $1.31 billion. 
The Zhuhai SEZ registered an export volume of $1.18 billion, an 
increase of 10.5 percent; while its import volume totalled $1.47 
billion, an increase of 10.9 percent. The Hainan SEZ's export 
volume totaled $710 million, an increase of 7.3 percent; while 
its import volume grew by a wide margin to $1.3 billion, an 
increase of 100.8 percent. 
  In terms of the trade mode, general trading and the business 
of processing with imported materials have continued to grow, 
while the business of processing with supplied materials has 
declined. As far as exports are concerned, general trading was 
$3.86 billion, an increase of 1.4 percent; processing with 
imported materials totaled $4.75 billion, an increase of 15.9 
percent; while processing with supplied materials was $1.37 
billion, a decrease of 15 percent. With regard to imports, 
general trading accounted for $4.3 billion, an increase of 40.7 
percent; processing with imported materials accounted for $3.82 
billion, an increase of 6.1 percent; processing with supplied 
materials accounted for $1.03 billion, a decrease of 17.4 
percent; while the value of equipment import by foreign 
investors totaled $1.44 billion, an increase of 50.5 percent. 
  If classified by the nature of enterprises, the 
import-export 
volume of the foreign-funded enterprises in the SEZ's has kept 
on increasing, although the growth margin was narrower than that 
for the import-export volume of foreign-funded enterprises of 
the whole country. The export volume of foreign-funded 
enterprises in the SEZ's amounted to $4.68 billion, an increase 
of 16.1 percent; their import volume amounted to $5.79 billion, 
an increase of 19.9 percent. For the same period, the average 
import and export growth margins for all the foreign-funded 
enterprises in the country were 42.9 and 63.4 percent 
respectively. Meanwhile, the proportion of SEZ foreign-funded 
enterprises of the total imports and exports by all 
foreign-funded enterprises in the country decreased from 31 to 
25.2 percent and from 26.1 to 19.1 percent respectively. 
  With regard to the export mix, primary products accounted 
for 
10.8 percent, while finished industrial products accounted for 
89.2 percent. As for the import mix, primary products made up 
13.7 percent, while finish industrial products made up 86.3 
percent.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Port Groups Springing Up Along China's </F>
Coastline"] 
  [Text] Nanjing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Three port groups are 
springing up in north China's Bohai Sea Rim Area, east China's 
Chang Jiang River Delta and south China, respectively. 
  They are all located in China's most developed regions. 
  China has 32,000 km of coastline and some 300 deepwater 
wharfs which can handle ships of 10,000 DWT [deadwieght ton] and 
over. In the past few years, both the central and local 
governments have stepped up efforts to construct ports. 
  The Bohai Sea Rim, the densest port group area in China, has 
now more than 40 ports along its 5,800-km coast, including 
Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin and Qingdao. It accounts for more 
than 40 percent of the nation's port handling capacity. 
  More large ports, including Huanghua Port in Shandong 
Province and Yingkou Port in Liaoning Province, will be enlarged 
and built in the area in the coming few years. 
  In the Chang Jiang River Delta, one of the key construction 
areas in China, a port group with Shanghai as the center has 
taken shape. 
  So far, more than 20 well-equipped and modernized ports have 
been built in the area, with more than 60 wharfs which can 
handle ships of 10,000 DWT and over. The area now accounts for 
about one third of the country's maritime cargo turnover. 
  According to local officials, the handling capacity of the 
Chang Jiang River Delta will double when Shanghai Port, Nanjing 
Port, Nantong Port, Beilun Port and Zhoushan Port are further 
expanded or renovated. 
  In south China a number of deep-water ports are under 
construction, apart from Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Shantou and 
Fuzhou. They will include a 100,000 DWT coal wharf, a 50,000 DWT 
oil transfer wharf and a 50,000 DWT container wharf. 
  An international port system incorporating energy, industry 
and trade is rapidly taking shape in south China. 
  According to China's transport departments, Qinhuangdao Port 
in Hebei Province has become the largest energy transmission 
port in the world. Dalian, Tianjin, Zhoushan and Beilun have 
respectively become China's largest foreign trade, container, 
crude oil transfer, and mineral ores and liquid petrochemical 
products transfer ports. 
  Economists predict that nearly ten ports in China, including 
Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Nanjing, Beilun, Guangzhou, Huizhou and 
Zhuhai, will each have a cargo-handling capacity of more than 
100 million tons by the end of the century. 
  At the same time, a port construction wave is surging along 
the coast of the Yellow Sea. 
  Rizhao in east China's Shandong Province has become the 
second- largest coal port in China. Jiangsu Province will also 
build large transfer ports for crude oil and coal at Qidong and 
Dafeng. 
  In addition, statistics show that ports on the Bohai Sea Rim 
have set up trade relations with more than 160 countries and 
regions and contribute to more than half of the country's import 
and export trade volume.

<F P=106> [Report: "State Land Administration Bureau, State </F>
Commission for Restructuring the Economy Issue Joint Circular on 
Management of Land Assets of Enterprises Listed in Stock 
Exchanges Abroad"] 
  [Text] In order to prevent loss of state-owned land assets 
of enterprises listed in stock exchanges abroad, the State Land 
Administration Bureau and the State Commission for Restructuring 
the Economy issued a joint circular a few days ago. 
  The circular touched on four aspects of enterprises listed 
in 
stock exchanges abroad, that is, the limits of and procedure for 
assessing state-owned land assets, how to handle state-owned 
land assets, the method and proportion of converting land-use 
rights into stocks, and registration of changes in land-use 
rights. 
  According to the stipulations, the work of assessing land 
assets of all stock-experimenting enterprises established within 
the territory and authorized to be listed in stock exchanges 
abroad must be solely organized and conducted by the State Land 
Administration Bureau. As far as the procedure of assessment is 
concerned, enterprises or designated stock-holding units of 
state-owned land assets must first apply for assessment and 
submit relevant registration certificates on land-use rights use 
to the authorities, and then enterprises must select one of the 
assessment organizations recommended by the State Land 
Administration Bureau to assess their land assets and results of 
the assessment must be reported to the State Land Administration 
Bureau for confirmation. 
  The circular provided for how to handle state-owned assets 
of 
stock-experimenting enterprises listed in stock exchanges 
abroad: First, land-use rughts are priced and converted into 
stocks. Land- use rights obtained by enterprises through 
purchase are priced and converted into stocks, whereas land 
assets are converted into legal- person stocks. Second, the 
State leases land-use rights to stock enterprises and receives 
appropriate rents. After obtaining land- use rights through 
purchase, enterprises can lease land-use rights to stock 
companies. 
  The circular also explicitly provided for the amount and 
proportion of equity capital converted from the rights of using 
state-owned land. The amount should not be less than the total 
of examined and verified land assets divided by multiples of 
stock premiums, and the proportion should not be less than the 
proportion of total land assets to total state-owned assets of 
stock enterprises. 
  The circular also stipulated that reorganized enterprises 
listed in stock exchanges abroad can only apply to people's 
government departments responsible for land administration at 
and above the county level for changes in registration after 
getting official written replies from the State Land 
Administration on confirming the conversion of land assets into 
stocks.

<F P=106> ["Economic Jottings" by Mu Zi (2606 1311): "`Legal Evasion </F>
of Taxes' Is Illegal"] 
  [Text] According to ZHONGGUO SHUIWU BAO [0022 0948 4451 
0523 1032 -- CHINA TAX JOURNAL], some strange phenomena, such as 
"legal tax evasion training class" and "lectures on legal tax 
evasion," have appeared in society recently. Some books on 
"legal tax evasion" also have been published. What a strange 
thing! How can "tax evasion" be "legal?" 
  As a matter of fact, the so-called "legal tax evasion" is 
aimed at instructing tax evaders to pay less tax or no tax at 
all under the pretext of "legality." In the final analysis, it 
is aimed at instigating people to violate the law. 
  In China, with the development of reform and opening up, the 
contradictions between tax evasion and the struggle against tax 
evasion are growing day by day. The phenomenon of tax evasion 
has appeared in both domestic and foreign-owned enterprises, but 
more frequently in the latter. 
  Of course, this does not mean that all foreign-owned 
enterprises have evaded taxes. Many of them have been doing 
well in this respect, but quite a few of them have tried to 
evade taxes by all means in the links, such as signing 
contracts, providing funds, carrying out production and 
management, purchasing equipment and materials, and selling 
products. This is also a fact. The main method they have used 
is to transfer profit and let the enterprises suffer "losses." 
Checking their accounts, we find that the losses suffered by 
some foreign-owned enterprises in some areas are more than 50 
percent of their investment. Ridiculously, very few such 
enterprises have closed down because of these losses. Some 
foreign- owned enterprises that are suffering "losses" have even 
continued to increase investment despite such losses. These 
abnormal phenomena merely show that their "losses" are not real 
and that what they are doing is precisely to evade taxes. By 
doing so, the "tax evaders" have earned greater profits, but the 
interests of the state have been harmed. 
  To absorb foreign funds and implement a preferential tax 
policy toward foreign-owned enterprises is a policy we have 
adopted since reform and opening up. The purpose is to promote 
cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. If the enterprises 
play tricks and try to evade taxes at the expense of the public 
interest, further cooperation between the two sides certainly 
will be harmed. This is not only a practice to which we are 
opposed, but also a practice that is not tolerated under 
international law. 
  Over the past few years, China's tax departments have 
studied 
the experience and practice of other countries in opposing tax 
evasion. Gradually, and in light of China's realities, they have 
worked out and perfected some laws, regulations, and methods, as 
well as a series of measures to fight tax evasion. It is 
necessary to run training classes on fighting tax evasion and to 
explain the relevant articles of the "Law of the People's 
Republic of China on Tax Levy and Administration" to those who 
try to evade tax payments "legally" so they can remember that it 
is illegal to "evade tax payments legally." It is also 
necessary for the departments concerned to check those people 
who are instigating others to "legally" violate the law, to see 
what kind of people they are.

"We Must Press On With Experimentation With Shareholding 
System-- Survey and Thoughts on Transformation of Enterprise 
Shareholding System in China (Part One)"; first paragraph is 
RENMIN RIBAO editor's note] 
  [Text] The CPC Central Committee's "Decision on Issues 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee set forth the task of "establishing a modern 
enterprise system." The fact that enterprises put into practice 
the shareholding system is one of the major forms of 
establishing a modern enterprise system. China has already 
experimented with joint-stock enterprises for several years and 
made new beneficial explorations for China's enterprise system. 
Recently, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, 
the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State 
Securities Commission jointly organized personnel to conduct 
surveys of some listed companies in some areas. The report 
written by a staff reporter and released today gives an idea of 
the surveys, the experience gained, and the new problems raised 
for everyone's reference. 
  Since China's economic restructuring has shifted from rural 
areas to cities, the vitality of state-owned enterprises, 
especially large and medium-sized enterprises, has been a 
central question with which we have always been concerned. What 
is the next step for deepening state-owned enterprises following 
the contracted responsibility system? Precisely against this 
background, the shareholding system was put forward. In October 
1987, the report to the 13th CPC National Congress pointed out 
that "the forms of the shareholding system emerging in the 
course of reform, including the form whereby the state holds 
most of the shares, departments, localities, and enterprises 
hold some shares, and individuals can buy shares, is an 
organizational form for the property of socialist enterprises 
and can be experimented with continuously." Since then, the 
number of experimental joint-stock enterprises in various 
localities has increased rapidly. At present, there are some 
5,000 joint-stock enterprises across the country, nearly 200 of 
which have their shares traded on the market. 
  As an organizational form of modern enterprise, the 
shareholding system is developing rapidly in China. Of course, 
this kind of development is still proceeding in an experimental 
stage. What people are concerned about is the question of 
whether or not the objective of deepening enterprise reform has 
been achieved after these experimental enterprises have been put 
into operation. If so, in what aspects is this reflected? 
<H3>  It Offers a Sharp Knife With Which To Separate Functions of 
the Government From Those of the Enterprise and a Foundation 
Stone on Which the Enterprise May Operate Independently. Now 
That the Enterprise as a Legal Body Possesses Property Rights, 
Its Numerous Relations With the Government Are Self-Evident, and 
Only By Being So, Can the Enterprise Operate Independently With 
Perfect Assurance. </H3>
  The idea for state-owned enterprise reform in recent years 
has basically been the delegation of administrative powers. 
Power delegation involves two questions: First, the concept of 
power delegation itself is not the negation of the system of 
excessively concentrating the powers of the enterprise in the 
hands of the government. Therefore, power delegation is only 
limited, and an enterprise cannot change its status as a 
subsidiary of the government despite power delegation. 
  Second, precisely because of the reasons mentioned above, 
there is a comparatively large degree of haphazardness in the 
government with regard to power delegation. It happens that 
when instructed to delegate power, the government will do so and 
that over time, it will recover the power delegated or that it 
will not delegate power unless this is beneficial to it. With 
regard to the government's delegation of power, the enterprise 
is totally in a passive and subordinate status and the functions 
of the government and of the enterprise are ultimately 
inseparable. Now that the assets of the enterprise are owned by 
the government and its managers are appointed by the government, 
what can an enterprise base its independent operation on? 
  Between August and September 1993, the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, the State Securities Commission, and 
the State Economic and Trade Commission jointly conducted 
special surveys of how listed companies in Shenzhen, Hainan, 
Shanghai, and Sichuan, where state-owned joint-stock enterprises 
are more concentrated, was changing their operation mechanisms. 
The surveys reported that by straightening out the relationship 
between ownership and management, the listed companies have 
smashed the traditional trammels of being subordinate to the 
government and have succeeded in separating their functions from 
those of the government and are able to operate independently. 
This is mainly reflected by the following: They have 
straightened out the relationship of interests with the 
government and have changed from being solely responsible to 
their supervisory departments to being responsible to all 
shareholders. The enterprises turn over taxes to the state and 
profits to owners, thus separating taxes from profits. They 
have complete rights over the use of assets. They have changed 
the previous practice of having their leaders appointed by the 
government and then hired by the board of directors. Regarding 
their investment decisions and project development, their board 
of directors will first put forward investment proposals and 
then decisions will be made by the meeting of shareholders. In 
this way, the enterprises have the power to operate 
independently and have money at their disposal. Managers of the 
listed companies share a common feeling, namely that they have 
all the 14 powers to be delegated to enterprises according to 
the "Regulations," although they find it difficult to refuse 
contributing to relevant quarters. This is incomparable with 
the past before the system was changed. In early November 1993, 
the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State 
Economic and Trade Commission, and State Securities Commission 
jointly called a symposium on the question of how listed 
companies are changing their management mechanisms and they had 
this common consensus: Listed companies are leading the way in 
changing management mechanisms. 
  Given the same enterprises and the same government, why has 
the relationship between the government and enterprises been so 
easily straightened out after enterprise transformation with the 
shareholding system and why was it difficult for the enterprise 
to operate independently in the past before it was transformed 
with the shareholding system? He Zhongze, who is deputy 
director of the Enterprise Department of the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economy, and who is currently under 
training as assistant manager of the Hainan Chemical Fiber 
Industry Company Limited, said: "Under the traditional form of 
ownership, the ownership of state property is not clearly 
defined, so all government departments can exercise the power of 
ownership on behalf of the state to interfere with the internal 
affairs of the enterprise. Nevertheless, all of the departments 
can shirk responsibility for the increase of the value of state 
assets. If ownership is theoretically unclear, it is of course 
impossible to define what belongs to whom in practice." Before 
changing to the shareholding system, the Hainan Chemical Fiber 
Industry Company Limited was a venture jointly developed by 
three companies which included the Hainan Provincial Development 
and Construction Corporation. This type of joint venture ought 
to have a certain degree of independence with respect to 
management mechanism compared with ordinary state-owned 
enterprises. But since the three controlling parties were 
state-owned enterprises, and since they employed different forms 
of investment in the joint venture, powers, responsibilities, 
and interests over the assets of the joint venture were not 
clearly defined, the three cooperative parties continually had 
conflicts with one another in the course of its management. In 
the course of transforming the joint venture, on the basis of 
scientific assets evaluation, the ownership of its stock assets 
was reasonably defined, several other legal bodies were invited 
to join as shareholders, and shares were issued to staff and 
workers internally, thus defining the property rights of all the 
assets of the joint venture in the form of law and setting 
multiple restrictions on the share powers of corporate and 
individual shareholders. The number of shares one holds 
determines one's power and say in the enterprise. Each party 
sends its own directors to the board of directors in keeping 
with the number of shares held. All shareholders, whether of the 
enterprise or the state, can only demonstrate their own will 
during the process of policymaking through the directors they 
have sent to the board. They cannot directly demand the 
managers obey their own commands. Moreover, since the managers 
are appointed by the board of directors, the general manager is 
solely responsible to the board, but not to the government or to 
a particular shareholder. Precisely because of this restricted 
relationship of responsibilities, powers, and profits 
established on the foundation of clearly defined property 
rights, interference from outside the enterprise is out of the 
question and the solicitation of instructions from higher 
authorities in the course of the enterprise's policymaking is 
unnecessary. Therefore, since practicing the shareholding 
system, the Hainan Chemical Fiber Industry Company Limited has 
all policymaking power within the enterprise and there is 
basically no interference from government departments. 
Shenzhen's Jintian Industries Company Limited cited such a 
fact: In 1987, the company vied with other state-owned 
enterprises to buy a newly built industrial plant in Liantang, 
Shenzhen. But before these state- owned enterprises' reports to 
their supervisory departments were approved, Jintian Company's 
board of directors had already acquired possession of the plant. 
For some time after Sichuan's Emeishan Salt Industry Group of 
Companies Limited changed to the shareholding system, the 
government departments concerned continued to manage the 
company's manpower and financial and material resources with the 
previous way of managing state-owned enterprises. Then the 
company's general manager Li Jianwen made representations to the 
departments concerned and these government departments decided 
very quickly to delegate all powers, changing administrative 
interference to participation in policymaking. On previous 
occasions of power delegation, enterprises could do nothing when 
they did not really get the power. But why did the government 
departments really delegate power this time? The reason was: 
Under the traditional system, an enterprise asking for power 
from the government meant sharing its power. The government was 
above the enterprise and so the latter was a "beggar." Now the 
government is only a shareholder of the enterprise and if it 
seizes all its power, it infringes on the interests of other 
shareholders. The enterprise asks for power from the government 
in order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of 
other shareholders, and in asking for power, this has a 
completely different meaning from the past. Now government 
departments are no longer faced with several factory managers 
and secretaries whom they could dismiss and hire at their 
discretion in the past, but with other investors who are on the 
same footing as they. Sometimes, the balance of interests has a 
stronger binding force than the government does. 
<H3>  The Publicly Listed Company Accepts the Supervision of the 
Community and the Public and Is At All Time Under Great Pressure 
from Investor Demands for Higher Returns. It Cannot But 
Exercise Control Over Itself. It Cannot But Consider Matters 
From the Long-Term Perspective. It Cannot But Gear Itself to 
the Needs of the Market. It Cannot But Compete. The General 
Manager Said: We Are Under Too Great Pressure. </H3>
  People in Shenzhen know that the Jintian Company is very 
successful and the bosses of the company should naturally make 
very good profits. Nevertheless, the first sentence the company 
president Cai Mingxi said to the survey team sent from the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State Economic and 
Trade Commission, and State Securities Commission: To be 
honest, none of us wish to work for joint-stock companies, 
especially listed companies. The pressure is too great! The 
pressure coming from the public on listed companies is several 
times greater than that coming from government supervisory 
departments on state-owned enterprises! 
  The Shenzhen Teli Machinery and Electricity Company Limited 
was transformed from the former Shenzhen Machinery Industry 
Company which was derived from the Shenzhen City Industry 
Bureau. Before adopting the shareholding system, it consisted 
of four state-owned enterprises and was given the annual profit 
target of over one million yuan and allowed to retain the 
remaining profits. The incomes of its staff and workers 
increased each year, so both the company and outside quarters 
were all satisfied. The situation is greatly different now that 
the company has adopted the shareholding system. After turning 
over taxes, the enterprise can only retain 15 percent of its 
profits as a welfare fund and another 50 percent as bonus 
dividends to shareholders. If less than the due amounts of 
dividends are given, the shareholders call up all day and asking 
what is going on. In the past, the enterprise emphasized stable 
operations. But this year, it is only expected to perform 
better than last year. Now it not only has to stress stability 
but must continuously forge ahead because the shareholders make 
comparisons. They demand that its profits be not lower than last 
year and not lower than others', or else the president would 
look bad when the mid-year and annual reports are given. Fang 
Shimao, chairman of the board of the company, said: In the 
past, if the company failed to complete the tasks, all we had to 
do was explain the objective reasons to the departments 
concerned and then we would be able to stay out of trouble. But 
now, the shareholders will not accept explanations but will 
force you to resign. It happened in the Shenzhen Anda Company 
Limited that in the first half of 1991, the company called a 
meeting of shareholders at which the shareholders unanimously 
insisted on the resignation of its general manager. There was 
only one reason for this, that was the bonus dividend allotted 
to them in the first half of the year was too low, with only 0.2 
yuan given for each share, which fell below the average profit 
margin of joint-stock companies in Shenzhen at that time. The 
then general manager had gone through observations by relevant 
departments and was found to be "competent," so the holder of 
state shares, the biggest shareholder, hesitated about whether 
or not to dismiss him and hire another person. As a result, 
many shareholders sold the warrants of the enterprise's enlarged 
number of shares, causing them to fall to 0.05 yuan per warrant 
and thus forcing the biggest shareholder to dismiss the general 
manager. In 1992, the bonus dividend for each share came to 
0.85 yuan. 
  As an enterprise without a higher authority over it, the 
joint- stock company must accept supervision from three 
quarters: First, by shareholders; second, by intermediary 
organizations in society; and third, by public opinion. The 
three quarters of supervision are mutually supplemental to a 
certain degree, enabling the joint-stock enterprise to possess 
an innately perfect self-restricting mechanism. Two major 
problems in connection with the management of state-owned 
enterprises were unresolved for a long time, namely their 
short-term behavior and making undetected losses. These two 
phenomena will almost not occur in the joint-stock enterprise. 
As the decisionmaker of the enterprise, the board of directors 
which represents the interests of shareholders is right in the 
enterprise, whereas the state-owned enterprise's supervisory 
department which has the final decisionmaking power is far from 
the enterprise, so the enterprise finds it very easy to deceive 
or hide the facts from the owners. However, the management 
activities of the managing body headed by the general manager is 
always under the supervision of the board of directors. Judging 
from the actual situation of joint- stock enterprises across the 
country, their boards of directors are basically comprised of 
directors sent from big shareholders. The interests of big 
shareholders are long-term interests, and they do not allow the 
managing body to seek short-term gain by means of sharing the 
enterprise's equipment with others. Still less will they allow 
the method of dividing and using up the profits to please 
floating speculating shareholders. Moreover, it is impossible 
for the managing body to seek short-term gain because short-term 
behavior weakens the competitiveness of the enterprise, and its 
harm will surely be manifested in the following year or two. 
Moreover, shareholders demand that the enterprise makes 
continually increasing profits. Ultimately the managers can 
hardly escape being held accountable to the shareholders. We 
can say, therefore, that there is no incentive for short-term 
behavior from the decisionmakers to the managers of a 
joint-stock enterprise. The accounting office checks the 
mid-yearly and annual accounting reports and figures of the 
enterprise against its accounts and then publishes the results 
of the checks to shareholders and assume legal responsibility 
for the results. Fang Shimao, chairman of the board of 
directors of the Shenzhen Teli Machinery and Electricity Company 
Limited, said: It was completely at my own discretion to report 
profits in the past, that means, when I wished to turn over 
more, then I reported more, and when I wished to turn over less 
I reported less. Now I cannot do this. I must report the exact 
profits or losses and the accounting office will not allow you 
to "report more or less," and it is more difficult to deal with 
than the supervisory department in the past. As managers, you 
cannot use the trick of reporting unnoticed losses, and you find 
this unnecessary. You can no longer drift along today, and then 
quit and take up a similar position elsewhere tomorrow. You 
will ultimately be held "accountable" tomorrow by the owners 
even if you hide yourself elsewhere. Public opinion will make 
you lose your prestige in society. 
  Precisely because of the pressure coming from the several 
areas, listed joint-stock enterprises generally have a sound 
financial management system. Many enterprises practice a 
financial management supervision system in which all financial 
supervisors and other key financial staff are directly sent from 
headquarters to their subsidiary companies, and their salaries 
and bonuses are all approved and paid by the headquarters to 
facilitate the effective management of the finances of 
subsidiary companies. Shen Yigang, the general financial 
director of Shenzhen's Jintian Company, said: "The financial 
transparence of listed joint-stock companies is one of their 
greatest characteristics. The half-yearly financial report and 
business performance bulletin are unavoidable responsibilities 
and obligations. Shareholders can query the business status of 
the company at all times and by all forms. Therefore, if 
managerial personnel at all levels of the company do not make 
great efforts to restrict themselves and boost economic returns, 
they cannot justify themselves at the meeting of shareholders." 
In the past, enterprises bargained with their supervisory 
departments in every effort to lower the profit target. After 
being transformed with the shareholding system, the sense of 
mission and urgency to increase of the value of the assets of 
enterprises drive managers to seek maximum profits for their 
enterprises. Without any outside interference, the Shanghai 
First Pencil Company Limited raised the profit target three 
times last year and succeeded in reaching it. In April, the 
company raised by 54 percent the profit target set earlier in 
the year at a meeting of shareholders. In this way, the 
interests of the enterprise, of shareholders, and of managers 
are perfectly integrated under the shareholding system. 
  Many general managers jokingly call themselves senior "wage 
earners." They can fire ordinary staff and even vice general 
managers, and can also be fired if the board of directors is 
unsatisfied with their business performance. There is this 
common consensus among listed joint-stock enterprises: 
Enterprises are owned by shareholders and you must think of 
ways to please them. 
<H3>  The Shareholding System, a Modern Enterprise System, Is 
Displaying its Attractive Charm in China's Enterprise Reform. 
Through Transformation to the Shareholding System, We Are 
Beginning To Be Able To Resolve Deep-Seated Economic Problems 
Such as Readjusting the Industrial Structure and Enhancing the 
Vitality of State-Owned Enterprises. </H3>
  In July, Shenzhen's Zhongguo Baoan Group of Companies 
Limited 
purchased large numbers of the shares of Shanghai's Yanzhong 
Company Limited and caused a great wave in Shanghai's stock 
exchange. Some people made a fortune and others got tied up. 
Shareholders were at a loss for some time. Despite the fact 
that this was the first time in China that a joint-stock 
enterprise purchased over 16 percent of the shares of another 
joint-stock enterprise without conforming to some norms, the 
China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee 
acknowledged the validity of the purchase. We should encourage 
this kind of purchase because this really shows that the most 
essential significance of the stock market is not to offer a 
site for stock speculators, but that it has formed an equity 
market, offering us an effective method of achieving the 
rational flow of assets, especially stock assets, on a larger 
scope and readjusting the industrial structure. The very reason 
the readjustment of the transregional and intertrade industrial 
structure has proceeded so slowly for many years does not lie 
with enterprises but with a plurality of departments. A merger, 
for example, would often put the numerous departments of two 
parties into protracted talks. In the case of the equity 
market, the Zhongguo Baoan Company saved the effort of 
consulting the relevant departments. Moreover, the Yanzhong 
Company had no idea about the purchase beforehand. How quick 
this transaction was concluded! How efficient it was! 
  Judging from the experimental joint-stock enterprises in 
China at the present time, the majority of them have 
transregional and intertrade characteristics. The Nantong 
Machine Tool Factory was a state-owned enterprise which entered 
the international market and whose exports had a ranking 
position in the same trade. But its productive capacity was 
inadequate and badly needed expansion. Nantong City had seven 
related factories. Some were people-owned enterprises; some 
were collectively-owned enterprises; and others were city and 
township enterprises. Of the people-owned enterprises, some 
were owned by the city and others by prefectures and counties. 
In order to merge the seven enterprises into one big company, 
they used the shareholding system to form the Nantong Machine 
Tool Company Limited, broke through departmental ownership and 
regional boundaries, and developed it into an enterprise group, 
readjusting the irrational enterprise structure. Each party was 
given bonus dividends according to the number of shares they 
hold. And through participation and decisionmaking in the board 
of directors, the various parties have coordinated their 
interests and brought into play their own initiative. This kind 
of joint-stock enterprise group formed by linking assets has its 
responsibilities, powers, and interests better defined than 
ordinary enterprise groups, smoother operational mechanisms, and 
therefore have a more obvious scale of merit. 
  The vitality of state-owned enterprises is a central 
question 
we are trying to settle in the course of reform. The vitality 
of state-owned enterprises and their structure are two 
questions, but they are interally very closely linked. The 
irrational structure affects vitality to a certain degree, 
because if vitality is lacking there is no motivation for 
structural readjustment. The shareholding system is like a 
two-edged sword which has changed the two questions from mutual 
containment to mutual promotion. The Shenzhen Property Company 
Limited originally had net assets totalling 100 million yuan. 
Its assets were assessed in the process of changing to a 
joint-stock enterprise and its net assets rose to 180 million 
yuan. Then through shares issued at a premium, its net assets 
leaped to over 600 million yuan. Its business has changed from 
just the construction industry to the construction industry, 
tourism, and the real estate industry. After changing to the 
shareholding system, it turned over 4.8 million yuan to the 
state each year. In 1992 when it was changed to a joint-stock 
enterprise and was listed, it earned 160 million yuan of profits 
and taxes. In the first six months of 1993, it earned an 
after-tax profit of 160 million yuan and it is expected to have 
no problem earning 300 million yuan of profits and taxes in the 
whole year. In this way, the state can earn 216 million yuan as 
it owns 72 percent of shares. The profit is many more times 
than in the past before it was changed into a joint-stock 
company! Sichuan's Emeishan Salt Chemical Company Limited sold 
the premiums of state shares, whose proportion was excessively 
large, to corporate enterprises, and invested the funds earned 
in other trades and industries with higher profits and better 
prospects of development. Now its national assets have 
increased in value and its salt production structure has been 
adjusted, strengthening its ability to adapt to changes in the 
market. 
  The results of the surveys conducted by the joint survey 
team 
of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Securities 
Commission show that the shareholding system, an organizational 
form of modern enterprises, enables listed enterprises to get 
huge vitality and demonstrates an exceedingly strong 
self-developing capacity. The actual profits earned by the 12 
listed companies syrveyed in Shanghai increased in 1992 over the 
same period the previous year, with the rates of increase 
ranging from 35 to 400 percent. Compared with the same period 
in 1992, the actual profits in the first six months of 1993 had 
increases ranging from 44 to 274 percent. The five companies 
listed in Hainan this year earned after-tax profits totaling 253 
million yuan in 1992, while their after-tax profits in the first 
six months of 1993 already reached 331 million yuan, 
representing a 30.83-percent increase in after-tax profits over 
the whole year of 1992. 
  The transformation of China's enterprise with the 
shareholding system is still at the experimental stage, and 
there is still a lot of work to do for us to further standardize 
it. We should not, of course, take pride in the achievements we 
have obtained, but all this has convinced us of the need to 
unswervingly proceed with experimentation with the shareholding 
system. As an important choice for us to deepen reform of large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and change their 
management mechanisms, the shareholding system is demonstrating 
its huge superiority.

"Shock of Modern Enterprise System--Survey and Thoughts on 
Transformation of Enterprise Shareholding System in China (Part 
Two and Last Part)"] 
  [Text] The period of experience in practice of the 
shareholding system has been a very short one. The shareholding 
system has invigorated our enterprises and boosted enterprise 
reform. Nevertheless, the most valuable thing of the short 
practice of establishing a modern enterprise system lies in the 
significance of the issues raised and settled in modifying the 
enterprise system and accelerating the pace of the establishment 
of a modern enterprise system rather than the achievements 
already attained. 
<H3>  The Sense of Reform of the Government Departments Is Not 
Enough for Establishing a Modern Enterprise System. At The Time 
When Enterprise Reform Has Entered a Stage of Blazing New 
Trails, the Pressing Task at the Moment Is To Upgrade Knowledge 
of Administrators and Comprehensively Improve Managerial 
Qualities of the Government. </H3>
  When an enterprise has undergone the transformation of a 
shareholding system, its decisionmaking powers will be properly 
implemented. However, this does not mean that relations between 
the enterprise and the government are brought to a proper 
balance. As regards the government, management over a 
shareholding enterprise is a brand new topic. The 
organizational form of a modern shareholding enterprise has 
unique operation means and a full set of well- organized and 
standard operational systems. If the excessive interference of 
the administrative departments in enterprises under the 
traditional system was mainly due to ambiguous relations of 
property rights, the contradictions between government 
departments and state enterprises after undergoing the 
transformation of the shareholding system should be attributed 
to the government, which is unfamiliar with operational rules 
under the shareholding system and with its management over the 
shareholding enterprises, and which has stuck to the traditional 
means of enterprise management. 
  A shareholding enterprise has no higher level authority. It 
is responsible only to the shareholders and to law. Over the 
years, however, the views of the higher levels are necessary in 
almost all affairs. After converting to shareholding, the forms 
of various departments remain unchanged and so do the "views of 
the competent department." Unless this is changed, 
administrative departments cannot rest assured and "dare not" 
approve any project. In order to remove this troubled 
procedure, a number of shareholding enterprises had to find 
"influential persons" or temporarily "hire one." In order to 
resolve such a problem, a shareholding enterprise in Shanxi 
submitted a report to the government, asking for approval to 
become an "enterprise without higher level leadership." 
Question: Haven't you already become an enterprise without a 
higher level? Answer: We just need a letter of approval. Some 
departments do not know what a shareholding company is even when 
you give them explanations. They only believe in letters of 
approval. 
  A shareholding company, particularly a listed one, has a 
strict financial system. A registered accountant's office gives 
an account of its operation, income, expenditure, and structure 
of shares to the public every half a year. Any information 
about the enterprise may affect shareholders' investment 
decisions on the enterprise and result in price fluctuations of 
its shares in the stock market. For this reason, information 
related to the enterprise operation cannot be disclosed at will, 
which may result in unfairness. However, the finance of a 
listed shareholding company in the south was audited by relevant 
departments on more than five occasions in the first half of 
1993. Some people asked jokingly: Who knows whether there are 
stock speculators among the administrative inspectors? Similar 
departments concerned asked the shareholding enterprises for the 
following operational figures: Rate of capital and delivery of 
profits and taxes, use of working capital, costs, and profits 
and losses. Such a practice did not cause any problem in the 
past. If a shareholding enterprise spreads such information at 
will, it will constitute a serious violation of the principle 
governing information of the company. Those who need 
information do not care about this: Why are the shareholding 
enterprises so uncooperative? Let us wait and see. You will 
come and ask us for help in the long run. 
  The findings of a joint survey by the State Commission for 
Reform of the Economy, State Securities Commission, and State 
Commission for Economy and Trade pointed out that an increasing 
number of laws, rules, and regulations have been promulgated by 
various localities and departments to restrain listed companies, 
some of which contradict with each other. Without an 
understanding of the "Opinions on Standardization of the 
Shareholding Enterprises," some localities still try to decide 
the level of enterprises, namely, the so-called "office level 
enterprises" or "departmental and bureau level enterprises." As 
a result, the board of directors have to consider the rank and 
level while employing managers. The director representing the 
state stake sent by the locality to a shareholding company only 
attends meetings but does not care about routine work. Hence, 
he knows nothing about the company's operation. When a meeting 
of shareholders is held, another person is sent to cast a vote. 
Some localities send a number of people who represent the state 
stake. As each expresses his own views, they cannot reach 
consensus on major issues. Similar stories are common in 
shareholding enterprises. These contradictions cannot be 
summarized by the implementation of enterprise decisionmaking 
powers. These are problems related to the shareholding system 
which government departments should understand, the operational 
rules of the shareholding system which they should be familiar 
with, the rights and interests of the shareholding enterprises 
which they should respect, and management and operation of the 
shareholding enterprises which they should upgrade. This shows 
that in establishing a modern enterprise system, government 
departments should emancipate their minds, upgrade their 
knowledge, and dare to be and be good at assimilating the 
advanced managerial experience of developed nations. The Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pointed out 
that the central task of enterprise reform is to establish a 
modern enterprise system, which involves many new concepts, 
terms, and expositions. Practically, it will be expressed in 
new operational methods and means of enterprise management. The 
transformation of the shareholding system has posed a series of 
problems in this regard. 
<H3>  The Establishment of a Contingent of Enterprise Managers Is 
Urgently Required for Establishing a Modern Enterprise System. 
We Should Intentionally Adopt Institutional Measures To Promote 
the Growth of This Contingent. </H3>
  In Shenzhen, a listed company which issued B shares told the 
survey team: Even the issue of B shares produced a negative 
effect. The views of foreign businessmen are different from 
those of ours on investment in real estate. We are optimistic 
about the real estate market, which was active in the first half 
of this year. However, the shareholders of B shares said that 
the risks in real estate was too big. They were against 
enterprise investment in real estate and blamed us for deviating 
from the investment orientation as stated in the new stock 
subscription brochure. As a matter of fact, the investors are 
most concerned about their returns. When a company is making 
profits, why is it necessary to meddle in its affairs? 
  At present the investment orientation of a number of 
shareholding enterprises runs counter to the new share 
subscription brochure, diverting the funds to trades other than 
the main one. According to statistics, at least 30 percent of 
the capital of the listed companies is not invested in the 
projects listed in the subscription brochure. In some 
localities, the figure goes as high as 70 percent and investment 
is made in a blind manner. These companies willfully change the 
purpose of the funds pooled because they are pressed by the 
shareholders for high returns and have invested their funds in 
profitable trades. In addition, it indicates that the managers 
of the listed companies do not respect the public investors and 
do not have a strong sense of law. The complaints about the 
shareholders of B shares prove this problem. The public is 
willing to make investment because they are optimistic about 
your enterprise. These people prefer low returns to high risks. 
Otherwise, they would have simply bought shares of the real 
estate companies. Domestic investors, particularly individuals, 
have become mature, and they have an increasingly higher demand 
for quality in managers of shareholding enterprises. 
  Following the transformation of the state-owned shareholding 
enterprises, the state can only control state assets by sending 
directors to participate in the making of policy decisions. 
What kind of people should then be sent to represent the state 
to perform such a task, ensure the legitimate rights of the 
state stake, and ensure incremental increases of the state's 
equity? A problem has cropped up: Because of a lack of special 
personnel who are good at operations and management, cadres who 
are not experienced in management are sent to symbolically 
represent the state's management over the enterprise. After 
all, there is a great difference in intellectual structure and 
qualities between cadres and enterprise managerial personnel. 
Because of the large numbers of shareholding enterprises in 
Shenzhen, some heads of the state assets management companies 
are directors of two companies. As a result, it is difficult to 
maintain the rights and interests of the state stake. 
  One of the marked and essential characteristics of the 
shareholding and modern enterprise system is its distinct 
property rights: Ownership by those offering capital is 
separated from the property right of the corporation. In other 
words, enterprise owners will not necessarily be the specific 
operators of enterprises and have a direct control over 
operation of the property. Instead, a person good at operations 
and management will be assigned in a certain form to exercise 
management. The modern enterprise system constitutes a 
transformation of the whole of China's enterprise system. It is 
the direction of reform for all kinds of enterprises, including 
state enterprises. Hence, we badly need large numbers of 
qualified personnel. 
  The formation of the contingent of enterprise managers 
depend 
on the following factors: First, property rights of enterprises 
must be clear and enterprises should carry out operation 
independently; second, incomes of managers should be relatively 
high so their value is expressed through their incomes; third, 
there must be an institutional and legal guarantee (including 
rights and responsibilities) to ensure that their value is 
recognized socially. 
  Of the enterprises surveyed by the three commissions, most 
enterprise managers made a common call: Increase the incomes of 
managers of shareholding companies and embody the principle of 
distribution based on efficiency. An assistant manager of the 
Shenzhen Property Development Shareholding Company Limited said: 
We are managers employed by a shareholding company, but our 
wages are still based on the standards for state cadres. We 
received the same wages although the the company's profits 
increased from 70 million to 300 million yuan. As the 
shareholders want high returns, the managers are bearing great 
psychological pressure, operational responsibility, and risks. 
If the shareholders do not consider returns of the managers, 
how can they boost the enthusiasm of the managers? Who will 
then be willing to be entrepreneurs of shareholding enterprises? 
Such a distribution system, which is unfair, neglects the labor 
value of the managers. If such practice continues, it will be 
impossible for entrepreneurs to become a competitive contingent, 
which assembles people with wisdom from society and allows the 
best to survive. 
  In defining property rights, we have started doing some work 
and made specific arrangements. The transformation of the 
shareholding system has enabled us to make a relatively 
successful attempt. In terms of distribution and honor, it is 
also a pressing task to tackle the problem of offering a system 
and legal environment for the growth of managers. 
<H3>  The Establishment of a Modern Enterprise System Is an 
Extremely Arduous and Complicated Project, Which Covers a Wide 
Range Far Exceeding Enterprise Reform. We Must Study the 
Problems Which We Cannot Avoid and Will Have To Face Sooner or 
Later. </H3>

  While operating in light of standard rules, the shareholding 
enterprises have encountered a difficult problem: How to 
properly handle relations between the "three old organizations" 
(party committee, trade union, and workers' congress) and the 
"three new ones" (board of directors, supervisory commission, 
and shareholders' committee). According to the rules of the 
shareholding system, the shareholders' committee is the highest 
organ of power of an enterprise. The board of directors is a 
standing committee which exercises power on behalf of the 
shareholders' committee and is responsible for making major 
policy decisions for the enterprise and employing senior 
managerial personnel. The supervisory commission exercises 
supervision over the board of directors, its members, and other 
managerial personnel. 
  The question in this regard is: How should party leadership 
be manifested in shareholding enterprises, which should also 
conform to the standard of operation of these enterprises? How 
should the role of the vital force of the workers be brought 
into full play in reform and development, and how should this 
converge and coordinate with the new shareholding system? These 
are problems which remain to be experienced and explored.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- The State Council, 
China's highest governing body, has decided to reduce tariffs on 
its auto imports by 70 percent from the beginning of this year. 
  It has also decided to abolish some measures concerning tax 
reduction and exemption for imported automobiles. 
  A spokesman with the General Administration of Customs of 
the 
People's Republic of China said the decision of the State 
Council to reduce tariffs on imported automobiles and adjust 
relevant measures concerning tax exemption would create 
conditions for conducting competition on an equal basis and 
preserving fair taxation, as well as promoting the development 
of China's auto industry and improving the country's investment 
environment. 
  He explained that too many or loosely designed tax reduction 
and exemption measures would not be conducive to exercising 
control over imports of automobiles or suit the demands of 
building a socialist market economic structure. 
  He believed that too many such measures would also seriously 
weaken macro-control over tariffs and give rise to smuggling and 
tariff evasion. 
  According to him, all those importing automobiles must pay 
import duties and other related taxes at the local customs, 
except those organizations and personnel who may continue to 
enjoy tax reductions and exemptions in accordance with the 
international treaties to which China is a party or agreements 
signed between the Chinese and foreign governments. Foreign 
cars sent by international organizations and foreign governments 
as gifts will not be subject to full taxation either. 
  Estimates from Chinese automobile trading firms show that 
about 400,000 foreign-made cars and vans entered the mainland 
market in 1993. 
  In the meantime, the number of cars and vans smuggled into 
China last year was about 100,000, compared with 90,000 in 1992.

"Power Industry Should Take the Road of `Unconventional' 
Development"] 
  [Text] RENMIN RIBAO's series report about the electric 
power issue revealed that the development of power production in 
our country was not suited to the needs of economic development. 
This has aroused the attention of all social circles. How can 
we change the situation of power shortages, which has lasted for 
23 years, and move the power industry out of the difficulties 
making it a "bottleneck" in the national economy so that it will 
actually take the lead in economic development? 
  In our opinion, to settle this problem, we must carry out 
in- 
depth reforms and take the road of "unconventional" development. 
  The so-called "unconventional" development means that 
developments should be made by breaking with conventions and 
that a new path of reform and development should be opened 
toward the goal of the socialist market economy. Thus, we 
should make up our minds to proceed from solving the deep-level 
problems that have been affecting the development of our 
country's power industry and making major breakthroughs in 
updating the conceptions, rationalizing production relations, 
reinforcing building of the legal system, adopting the 
standardized joint-stock system, promoting the separation of the 
government from the enterprises, transforming the enterprise 
management and operation mechanisms, and establishing a modern 
system for the power producing enterprises. In particular, it 
is necessary to actually intensify marcocontrol, further 
increase investment, expand the scope of raising funds and 
inviting foreign investment for running power plants, quicken 
the pace of the electricity price reform, raise the debt 
repayment capacity of the power plants, promote economical and 
effective use of electric energy, substantially enhance the 
economic efficiency of the enterprises, further emancipate the 
productive forces in the power industry, and eventually create 
favorable conditions for effecting a benign cycle in the 
development of the power industry. Therefore, "unconventional" 
development not only indicates quantitative increases but also 
qualitative leaps; it not only requires a high growth speed but 
also a rationalized operational mechanism. 
<H3>  I. The Power Industry Cannot Move Out of the "Bottleneck" 
Condition If It Merely Follows the Course of Conventional 
Development </H3>
  The power industry can also develop in a conventional 
pattern, but in such a large country as ours, it will never be 
able to meet the needs of economic development and the needs of 
the people in their daily lives. In 1949, in the mainland, the 
total electricity generating capacity was only 1.86 million kw, 
and the annual electricity output was 4.3 billion kwh. After 
the founding of New China, through nearly 40 years' 
construction, in 1987, the capacity of installed generators and 
the electricity output both leaped to the fourth place in the 
world. It is expected that by the end of this year, the 
national installed capacity will have exceeded 180 million kw 
and the annual power output will have exceeded 800 billion kwh. 
This means that at present, two day's average power output in 
the whole country is equivalent to the whole year's power 
production in 1949. 
  However, while power production was increasing rapidly, most 
areas of the country were still facing increasingly serious 
power shortages. The "bottleneck" constraint from power 
shortages on our country's modern construction continued to be 
aggravated. We can say that the localities which achieved 
higher economic growth rates and made quicker development in the 
power industry were also facing the most serious power shortages. 
  We cannot say that the state did not attach importance to 
the 
power industry in the more than 40 years after liberation; nor 
can we say that the investment in the power industry was too 
modest; and still less can we underestimate the effects of 
reform and opening in the last more than 10 years on the 
transformation of the power industry's management system. In 
all fairness, however, such efforts and reforms still did not 
break through the conventions in the development of the power 
industry. This was quite natural. Most of the reform measures 
and policies we adopted in the past were related to the 
traditional structure of the planned economy and were 
unavoidably constrained by the framework of the old systems, so 
they could not thoroughly overcome the problems of the 
traditional structure. It was precisely these problems which 
restrained the power industry from taking the lead in the 
development of the national economy. 
  The problems of the old structure mainly found expression 
in the fact that enterprises were not separated from the 
government and the power enterprises remained affiliates of 
administrative institutions. First, in the structure of the 
planned economy, macrocontrol was never freed from some people's 
subjective haphazardness and this resulted in the insufficiency 
of investment in the power industry, which developed on a 
comparatively too small scale. The experts from the World Bank 
held that investment in power production in developing countries 
should account for over 2 percent of the GNP. However, the 
annual average in our country in the period between 1980 and 
1992 was only 1.24 percent. Experience shows that in the course 
of a country's industrialization, the normal ratio between 
power-consuming equipment and the capacity of power-generating 
equipment should be 2:1. However, the ratio in our country was 
far larger than 2:1 for many years. Not only is the existing 
ratio much larger than 2:1 but the ratio for new equipment is 
also larger than 2:1. Second, the work of economizing on 
electric energy has never been placed in an important strategic 
position and there are no relevant policies and measures and no 
effective mechanisms and institutions for ensuring this. As a 
result, people in all social circles do not pay sufficient 
attention to energy economy. This has also made it hard to 
widely and effectively adopt the measures for conserving 
electric energy. The serious wastage of electric power thus 
existed side by side with serious power shortages. Third, the 
property rights were unclear. Responsibility, power, and benefit 
in power production were not unified. The enterprises had to 
eat from the same "big pot" of the state and workers had to eat 
from the same "big pot" of the enterprise. For a long time, 
state finances were responsible for all expenditure and revenue 
in the power industry. Even after the management contract 
system was adopted, this situation was not thoroughly changed. 
The power enterprises had to deliver over 90 percent of their 
profits to the state authorities in the form of various taxes 
and fees. As they were situated in the narrow crevice between 
the central and local financial authorities, the power 
enterprises basically did not perform the investing and 
financing functions. In foreign countries, power enterprises 
normally hold 50 percent of the funds invested in capital 
construction; and some even hold as much as 90 percent. In our 
country, however, the power enterprises held less than 5 percent 
of the funds invested. Because the power enterprises were not 
independent commodity producers and dealers in real terms, they 
were not faced with the pressure of competition. Overstaffing 
was a prominent and longstanding problem in these enterprises. 
  The problems of the old structure also found expression in 
the serious distortion of electricity prices, which did not 
reflect the value of electric power nor the relationship between 
supply and demand. The inappropriateness of the electricity 
price led to a situation wherein the commodity attribute of 
electric power was neglected by people for a long time, making 
the power enterprises compete with other enterprises under 
unfair conditions. As a result, the power enterprises could not 
build up a management mechanism with perfect functions. This 
was unfavorable to raising funds for developing the power 
industry and also unfavorable to economizing on electric power 
and restraining the excessive demand on it. Moreover, this was 
also unfavorable to rationalizing the industrial structure and 
to expanding the use of foreign funds for running the power 
industry. 
  Within the power industry, being affected and shackled by 
the 
traditional structure, people's understanding of the market 
economy lagged behind and the managerial personnel were not 
familiar with such concepts as market, competition, economic 
efficiency, and the input-output ratio. Thus, it is necessary 
to thoroughly update their mentality. 
<H3>  II. To Effect "Unconventional" Development, It Is Necessary 
To Concentrate on Deepening Reform, Transforming Management 
Mechanisms, Optimizing the Operational Structure, and Enhancing 
Efficiency </H3>
  In 1975, when Comrade Xiaoping took charge of the work of 
the 
State Council, he pointed out the need to quicken the 
construction rate in the power industry to match it with the 
development of the national economy as a whole and to leave a 
certain leeway for ensuring that the power industry can take the 
lead in development. Putting Comrade Xiaoping's instruction into 
practice is the goal of the power industry's efforts under the 
new situation. According to our plan, in the period between 
1995 and 1997, the capacity of new large and medium generating 
sets should reach an average of over 15 million kw annually; and 
in the period between 1998 and 2000, this should increase to 20 
million kw annually. While the electricity sources are 
increasing, power technology and power grids as well as 
education in the power industry should also develop at the same 
pace. Thus, by the end of this century, the total capacity of 
installed generators in our country will reach about 310 million 
kw. If GNP increases by 8 to 9 percent annually and the power 
consmption of the unit output value in the whole country 
declines by 8 or 9 percent, then the power shortages will have 
been basically overcome and power supply will reach all 
counties. Over 95 percent of the peasant households will be 
able to use electricity. To achieve this objective, we must 
deepen reform and seek "unconventional" development. 
  The "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee indicated that the economic reform in 
the whole country had entered a new stage of comprehensive, 
accelerated, and well coordinated development. The recent 
national economic work conference also advanced reform in giant 
strides and adopted many reform measures. This provided an 
unprecedentedly good opportunity for the "unconventional" 
development of the power industry. In order to grasp and use 
this opportunity well, the power industry must formulate the 
reform strategy, which is mainly oriented to reorganizing the 
power enterprises according to the corporate system and shifting 
them onto the path of commercial operations, as quickly as 
possible and effectively put it into practice. 
  The adoption of the corporate system is a useful exploration 
in the establishment of the modern electric power enterprise 
system. The key issue is to set up a modern electric power 
enterprise system which is suited to the requirements of the 
market economy, has clear property rights, distinctly defines 
responsibility and power, separates the enterprise from the 
government, and exercises scientific management. Commercial 
operation is the inevitable result of the market-oriented reform 
in the power enterprises. The key issue is to firmly establish 
the concept that electric power is a commodity; create a policy 
environment for ensuring fair competition; and really turn the 
power enterprises into economic entities and market competitors 
which operate independently, bear sole responsibility for their 
own profits and losses, and have the ability to effect 
self-developemnt and exercise self-control. This is precisely 
the path of the standardized joint-stock system. 
  The joint-stock system is a rather effective form of 
enterprise organization and operation as it is suited to the 
need, in the development of socialized production, for the rapid 
concentration of capital and it has been widely adopted in 
various countries. In addition, it is also an organizational 
form which can better give expression to the nature of the 
socialist whole people ownership system and is an effective way 
to effect the "unconventional" development of the power 
industry. According to the current condition of our country's 
power industry and its tasks, the joint- stock system should be 
adopted and experimented with; this is more urgent and more 
favorable in the power industry than in other industries. The 
primary purpose of adopting the joint-stock system in the power 
industry is to effect the transformation of the enterprise 
management mechanism and the key to its success lies in strict 
standardization. In essence, the so-called standardized 
joint-stock system must: Be in keeping with our country's 
specific conditions; follow the general laws governing the 
socialist market economy as well as the special laws governing 
production, marketing, and purchasing in the power industry; be 
in line with the state's general requirements on experiments 
with the joint-stock system and the state's "20-character" 
guideline for the power industry's reform and development; and 
must be favorable to the fundamental emancipation of productive 
forces in the power industry. 
  In 1987, the State Council formulated a guideline for the 
reform and development of the power industry: "Separating the 
enterprises from the government, turning the provincial grids 
into economic entities, combining the grids, unifying power 
distribution, and raising funds to develop the power industry." 
The State Council also laid down the principle of "adopting 
measures in the light of the conditions of local grids." 
Practice has proved that this is a good guideline which is in 
keeping with China's national conditions and the intrinsic laws 
of the power industry. It systematically reveals the way to 
solve the deep problems affecting the development of the power 
industry. Under the new situation of the socialist market 
economy, "separating the enterprises from the government" is the 
orientation to which the reform and development of the power 
industry must adhere. "Turning the provincial grids into 
economic entities and combining the grids" is the conclusion 
drawn from the objective laws governing the development of the 
power industry and the reality of China's economic management. 
In essence, it stresses that the provincial and transprovincial 
power grids should all be economic entities operating 
independently, bearing sole responsibility for their own profits 
and losses, and having the ability to develop on their own and 
exercise self-control. At the same time, they also form an 
interest community composed of the interests of various 
quarters. "Unifying power distribution" is determined by the 
intrinsic law of the power industry and the complete concept of 
"unifying power distribution and exercising management at 
different levels." Raising funds to develop the power industry 
is a major result of the structural reform in the power 
industry. The power industry should develop ahead of other 
industries. It is necessary to use both domestic and overseas 
funds from domestic and international markets. The orientation 
of "raising funds to develop the power industry" must be 
maintained. The forms of fundraising to develop the power 
industry should also be improved and upgraded in the structure 
of the socialist market economy and should be gradually upgraded 
to the advanced form of joint ventures based on the standardized 
joint-stock system. The standardized joint-stock system is the 
advanced form of raising funds to develop the power industry. 
It not only has stronger investing and financing functions, and 
can more effectively attract international and domestic funds, 
but also can rationalize the complicated production relations 
formed in the course of raising funds to develop the power 
industry because it clearly defines the property rights. This 
provides a legal guarantee for the real separation of ownership 
from management power, ensuring the legitimate rights and 
interests of investors and the operation of managers in light of 
the laws and regulations. This is favorable to the 
standardization of raising funds to develop the power industry 
and using foreign funds and is also favorable to the authorized 
operation of state assets. Thus, the operational efficiency of 
the state assets and other assets will be enhanced and the value 
of the state assets and other assets will be better preserved 
and increased. "Adopting measures in the light of the 
conditions of the local grids" is a principle that must be 
followed in the structural reform and development of the power 
industry. As long as we constantly arrange everything according 
to the actual conditions, we can certainly find the path of 
pursuing the standardized joint-stock system suited to the 
conditions of various localities and various local grids, 
promoting the healthy development of the power industry. 
  Following the "20-character" guideline, we can adopt various 
forms of the standardized joint-stock system. No matter which 
form is used, the enterprises must voluntarily involve 
themselves in the joint-stock system. For example, after the 
provincial grids are allowed to turn themselves into economic 
entities under the standardized joint-stock system, with the 
approval of the administrative departments in charge at the 
upper level, there may exist a certain number of power companies 
managed by investors on their own and power plants run by other 
industries. However, they must sign grid-connection agreements 
with the local grids as well as electric power purchase and sale 
contracts in order to guarantee their interests and clarify 
their responsibilities. With the approval of the administrative 
departments in charge of the power industry at the upper levels, 
experiments with newer and more dynamic management forms of the 
joint-stock system may be carried out within a certain scope and 
according to the conditions of local economic development, such 
as in some cities and counties in the eastern coastal areas 
where the economies are growing faster. They can be called 
power industry "development zones." It is hoped that local 
governments will formulate as many favorable policies as they 
can to encourage various quarters to run power plants. People 
determined to engage themselves in the power industry should 
fully and properly apply these favorable policies, increase 
their investment, and increase the production of electricity at 
a higher annual rate. This will bring about a chain-reaction 
mechanism favorable to the development of the power industry. 
This is a major measure for encouraging the economically 
developed localities to become rich first in the consumption of 
electric power and bear responsibility for increasing power 
supplies and perfecting the local power grids. 
<H3>  III. With the Standardized Joint-stock System, It Is 
Necessary To Strengthen Leadership, Boldly Carry Out 
Experiments, and Make Steady Advances </H3>
  Through the market-oriented and world-oriented reform and 
opening in the past more than 10 years, a good foundation has 
been laid for us to adopt the standardized joint-stock system. 
On the whole, however, our reform remains in the initial stage 
and unevenness is prevalent. At present, the pilot schemes of 
adopting the standardized joint-stock system have just been 
started in some enterprises of higher quality and stronger 
competitive power, to achieve results and to accumulate 
experience for guiding the nationwide reform. Other enterprises 
should also actively create the necessary conditions, improve 
their quality, and make steady advances. They must not rush 
headlong into mass action. 
  The enterprises which carry out the pilot schemes for the 
standardized joint-stock system must strictly follow the 
regulations and procedures laid down by the state and the 
ministry, advancing their work in a well planned and orderly 
manner by taking one solid step after another. They should act 
in light of their concrete conditions according to the 
"20-character" guideline and should actively explore the 
concrete forms of practicing the standardized joint-stock system 
which suit their own conditions. Their efforts should be 
focused on studying and determining the concrete organizational 
form of practicing the standardized joint-stock system. 
  Various power groups should perfect their organizational 
structures in the light of the requirements of the modern 
enterprise system and also improve their functional structure 
according to the requirements of commercialization. The key 
point is to implement the State Council leading comrade's 
instructions on allocating part of the state investment to the 
power groups as their capital funds, to strengthen their 
investing and financing functions, and setting up a power grid 
construction fund so that backbone grids will be constructed and 
managed by the groups which are also responsible for contracting 
loans, paying interest, and repaying debts. The power groups 
must control 100 percent of the shares in the backbone power 
grids and should directly contract loans from the state's 
Development Bank. It is necessary to enliven the existing state 
assets in the power industry. For example, after the income 
from power supply is used to repay the debts and pay interest, 
the principal and interest payments should be reinvested in the 
power industry and managed by the power enterprises. The 
existing and added assets of the power grids should not be 
managed separately; instead, they should all be managed by the 
power group corporations. The power group corporations should 
input the state's capital funds to the large backbone power 
plants with the capacity to bear the peak load of the power 
grids, including the water- pumping energy conservation power 
plants and the power plants and nuclear power plants bearing the 
peak loads. They should also exercise effective control and 
direct management over these power plants on behalf of the 
state. The state-controlled power corporations with limited 
liabilities and limited shares should be established on this 
basis. 
  It is necessary to carry out the principle of allowing 
various quarters to run power plants with the grids being 
brought under unified management. Under the premise of 
guaranteeing the safe operation of the power grids, we can 
explore various other forms of practicing the standardized 
joint-stock system inside the power grids. Domestic and 
overseas investors should be encouraged to input funds to start 
new power plant projects. However, investments and loans should 
be clearly separated. Investors may earn dividends according to 
the size of their shares and lenders may receive principal and 
interest payments. The parties contributing funds may select 
their roles as investors or lenders. 
  In the next seven years, the power industry will need to use 
$25 billion of foreign funds in order to import 45 million kw 
power generation equipment. Therefore, in addition to expanding 
the use of foreign government loans, loans offered by 
international financial institutions, and commercial loans, we 
also need to attract more direct foreign investment in the power 
industry. This will promote the reasonable movement of existing 
capital. Foreign investors should be encouraged to launch joint 
ventures, start cooperation projects, or make independent 
investments in the field of building power plants. It is 
necessary to establish and perfect the legal system for the use 
of foreign funds in the power industry and effectively reinforce 
the management of the trades that need to use foreign-funded 
power. The state interests should be guaranteed, leadership 
should be strengthened, the regulations should be strictly 
enforced, and risks should be undertaken jointly. The foreign 
funds should not be used at too high a return rate or a fixed 
return rate in order to prevent the Chinese side from incurring 
losses. 
  Reform is aimed at emancipating and developing the 
productive 
forces. It is necessary to emancipate and develop the 
productive forces in the power industry and to ensure that the 
power industry takes the lead in development. Thus, we must 
fully arouse the initiative of the central and local authorities 
and the initiative of all quarters. This is the key to the 
success of the reform. 
  In order to effect "unconventional" development of the power 
industry and make it better serve the development of the 
national economy we must, under the correct leadership of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council and with the great 
support of the comprehensive departments, exert ourselves, do 
solid and effective work, improve our work style, combine the 
long-term objective with down-to-earth work attitude, unite as 
one, and make persistent and unswerving efforts. We shall then 
certainly be able to achieve our goal.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China installed power 
generators with a total capacity of more than 12 million kw last 
year, five percent over the state's target. 
  According to the State Planning Commission, altogether 62 
sets of medium- and large-size generators were constructed and 
put into operation, bringing the country's overall generating 
capacity to more than 180 million kw. 
  China has vowed to speed up its power construction to remove 
the bottleneck the present inadequate setup has on economic 
growth. Statistics show that the country's electrical power 
production in 1993 surpassed 800 billion kwh [kw hours]. 
  More emphasis has been put on the installation of medium- 
and 
large-size generators instead of the smaller ones in a bid to 
raise generating efficiency. 
  Meanwhile, the utilization of water energy featured high in 
China's power endeavor last year; hydropower generators with a 
capacity of more than three million kw, or 25 percent of the 
total installed last year, were built. 
  Officials at the State Planning Commission said the 
government has extended preferential treatment to boost the 
development of the power industry. 
  Likewise, they said, local governments have increased their 
investment in power projects.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (CNS) -- Statistics released by 
the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry show that steel 
production was initially put at 88.3 million tonnes last year, 
9.1 percent up over the previous year, steel material was 76 
million tonnes and pig iron 86.5 million tonnes, all of which 
registered a 10 percent rise over 1992. 
  Medium- and large-sized enterprises remain the pillar of 
China's steel and iron industry in China with 80 percent of the 
newly increased steel and steel material production turned out 
by these enterprises. 
  Key items and those of higher technology involved in the 
metallurgical industry made progress. The fixed assets 
investment in the steel industry for the whole year is expected 
to be RMB [renminbi] 25.7 billion while the newly increased 
capacity of iron-smelting was put at 10 million tonnes and 
steel-smelting capacity at 7 million tonnes. Fixed assets 
investment in the gold industry was valued at RMB 1.14 billion. 
  The steel industry showed an obvious gain in its economic 
results mainly because of a sharp rise in production volume, 
adjustment of structure and the price factor. The year-round 
profit tax turned out was valued at RMB 56 billion, 95 percent 
up over the previous year while the profits earned were put at 
RMB 28.5 billion last year, a gain of 177 percent over the 
previous year.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China aims to 
produce 81 million tons of rolled steel this year, an increase 
of 6.6 percent over 1993's figure. 
  Sources at a national metallurgical working conference which 
opened here today said that China is preparing to achieve the 
target through enhancing technical renovations in major iron and 
steel mills. More effort will be put into the expansion of 
continuous casting, and the development of new technology and 
new products. 
  Last year China produced 76 million tons of rolled steel, up 
13.5 percent compared with the output of the previous year. 
  The emphasis will be on increasing the output of steel 
products that are urgently needed in the Chinese market. They 
include special types of plates and pipes, heavy rails and sheet 
steel.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yan Bing: "Build an Extensive </F>
Communications Framework -- Review of and Prospects for the 
Building of Communications in China in the Past Year"; from the 
"'93 Yearender" column -- first paragraph is editor's note] 
  [Text] Time flies, and 1993 is coming to an end. 
Reviewing our work over the past year, we can see in retrospect 
that with the encouragement of the Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
spirit of the 14th party congress, and the "Resolution" adopted 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
the whole party and the people of all nationalities of the 
country have attained heartening accomplishments in deepening 
reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating the pace of 
development. At present, our country is enjoying a sound 
situation featuring economic growth, political stability, 
national unity, and social progress. A retrospective of our 
work over the past year will give us encouragement to work 
harder and strive for greater achievements in the coming year. 
To this end, this newspaper herwith opens a special column "'93 
Yearender," in the hope that it can become a window showing the 
rapid changes that have taken place on the Divine Land in the 
past year. 
  At the end of the year, latest figures released by the State 
Statistics Bureau showed that since the beginning of this year, 
the state's fixed-asset investment in the communications and 
transportation industry exceeded 80 billion yuan for the first 
time, making up 17 percentage points of the total investment by 
state- owned units. Construction of China's basic 
communications facilities has begun to enter a historical phase 
of large-scale development. China's extensive communications 
framework is taking shape gradually -- a comprehensive 
transportation network system based on the well-coordinated 
operation of railroads, high-grade highways, major coastal 
ports, inland river routes, and key airports. 
<H3>  Railroad: Winning the Very First Victory in a Decisive 
Three-Year Battle </H3>
  In December, the construction of the 1,000-li 
Beijing-Kowloon 
Railroad was in full swing: Tracks were being laid and a bridge 
erected to the north of the Huang He; infrastructure [xian xia 
4848 0007] projects were going full steam ahead; to the south of 
the Chang Jiang, construction was being unfolded in a 
comprehensive way. The first year of the construction of the 
Beijing-Kowloon Railroad, which is a "key project of all key 
projects" launched by the Ministry of Railways during the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan, has entailed more than 2 billion yuan of 
investment and has won its very first victory. 
  This is the first year of a decisive three-year battle 
launched by the Ministry of Railways. The curtain of the 
railroad construction was drawn open at a time when the rail car 
utilization rate of major bottleneck sections had gone down to 
40 percent and the potential-tapping renovation had yielded no 
result. A total of 11 key projects started construction at the 
same time in almost all provinces, autonomous regions,and 
municipalities. At the end of the year, the construction of a 
number of key projects scheduled to for completion at the end of 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan, had reached a high tide, including 
the Beijing-Kowloon Railroad, the Lanzhou- Xinjiang Multitrack 
Railroad, the Baoji-Zhongwei Railroad, the Houma-Yueshan 
Railroad, the Zhejiang-Ganzhou Multitrack Railroad, the 
electrification renovation of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railroad, as 
well as the renovation projects concerning the Hengyang North, 
Zhuzhou North, and Guangzhou North Railroad Stations. After 
these projects are completed and put into operation, China's 
transportation capacity will increase by 200 million tonnes. 
  Next year is a crucial one for the "decisive three-year 
battle" of railroad construction. By the end of the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan, China's operational railroad mileage will total 
60,000 km, the rates of multitrack and electrification will 
reach 30 and 23 percent respectively, the handling capacity of 
railroads will increase considerably, and the present tight 
transportation situation will be alleviated. 
<H5>  Water, Land, and Air: Each Enjoying Major Breakthroughs </H5>
  A new chapter also has been opened with the construction of 
highways -- another of China's major means of land 
transportation. A modern highway network has taken shape which 
focuses on highways for the exclusive use of vehicles and aims 
to achieve the goal of "two verticals and two laterals" across 
the country. 
  Construction of three high-grade highways between Beijing 
and 
Shanghai, Beijing and Shenyang, and Chongqing and Beihai, has 
been accelerated, while technical renovation is being carried 
out of the "two verticals and two laterals" -- the national 
trunk lines between Tongjiang and Sanya, Beijing and Zhuhai, 
Shanghai and Chengdu, and Lianyungang and Horgos -- with the aim 
of upgrading these trunk lines at an early date. Within two 
years, China will have an additional 90,000 km of highways, and 
an additional 30,000 km of second-grade highways. As a result, 
China's highway situation will be improved considerably, 
transportation capacity will be enhanced immensely, and the 
average driving speed on national trunk lines can exceed 50 km 
per hour, thus giving full play to the advantages of highway 
transportation: speed, convenience, and flexibility. 
  This year, departments in charge of water transportation 
have given priority to solving problems caused by lack of 
unloading capacity at ports, and have designed and built a large 
number of modern ports with deep-water berths. By 1995, the 
coal loading capacity of coastal ports will reach about 120 
million tonnes. After the completion of coal ports in Dalian, 
Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as well as power station ports in 
Waigoqiao, Shenzhen, and Zhanjiang, the coal unloading capacity 
of these places also will reach 130 million tonnes, thus 
obtaining a basic balance between loading and unloading 
capacities. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, a total of more 
than 100 deep-water berths are being built up in coastal ports, 
with newly added handling capacity of 140 million tonnes. 
  China's civil aviation industry, which is enjoying a 30 
percent increase in transportation volume each year, has placed 
its focus on the construction of airport support facilities this 
year. Airports are being built in (or moved to) Wuhan, Guiyang, 
Shijiazhuang, Guilin, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and 
Sanya; while a number of key airports have been expanded and 
renovated, including those in Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Lhasa, 
Harbin, Urmuqi, and Lanzhou. By the end of this century, the 
total number of China's civil airports will reach 146; the total 
volume of circular flow of civil aviation transportation will 
reach 12.2 billion tonne/km; and the passenger transport volume 
will reach 100 billion, thus basically meeting the needs of 
economic development and exchanges with foreign countries. 
<H3>  Next Year: Foreign Investment Will Be Utilized in More 
Fields </H3>
  Li Duanshen, director of the Transportation Department of 
the 
State Planning Commission, said during an interview the other 
day: "This year, China has made unprecedented investment in the 
construction of basic transportation facilities, and has 
attained in many fields a rapid progress not seen for many 
years. China's tight communications and transportation 
situation is expected to be eased by the end of this century. 
During the last seven years of the 1990's, the state will start 
nearly 400 large- and medium-scale communications and 
transportation projects, entailing investment of more than 700 
billion yuan. However, we are still faced with the problem of 
insufficient funds." 
  In order to attract more funds, the state will adopt in the 
coming several years a series of effective measures to allow 
foreign investors to participate in the construction of 
communications projects. With a view to enhancing the 
efficiency of investment, while encouraging Sino-foreign joint 
ventures or solely foreign- owned companies to build up highways 
and ports, and encouraging joint ventures to build up railroads 
and civil airports (excluding the aviation management system), 
the state will allow investors to engage in comprehensive 
compensation trade within a preset scope in districts along 
railroad lines and high-grade highways, and in port areas. 
  The year 1993 is one in which China's communications 
construction is striving to extricate itself from a low ebb and 
to make major breakthroughs. Under the guidance of the state's 
macroeconomic policies to check the "bottleneck" restrictions 
and with the backing of huge funds designated by the state, the 
country now is gradually improving the conditions of national 
trunk lines, including thoroughfares for coal transportation 
centering on energy bases in the "three Xi's [Shanxi, Shaaxi, 
and western Mongolia]"; passenger transport thoroughfares 
centering around large and medium-sized cities; and trunk 
transportation lines among all major economic regions and with 
foreign counties. In addition, the country also is striving to 
coordinate the operation of water, land, and air transportation. 
At present, the framework of China's comprehensive 
communications network -- which consists of trunk lines, feeder 
lines, ports, and station hubs -- has taken initial shape.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- With the inauguration 
of the Jinan-Qingdao expressway a few days ago in east China's 
Shandong Province, China last year extended the length of its 
expressways to 1,293 km, according to the "CHINA COMMUNICATIONS" 
[ZHONGGUO JIAOTONG] newspaper. 
  The Ministry of Communications decided to construct 
expressways at the beginning of the 1980s when the country's 
economy began to boom. 
  Building of the first one started in 1984 in northeast 
China, 
from Shenyang to Dalian. After its completion in 1990, the 
375-km- long road brought with it great economic and social 
efficiency. 
  The ministry made a long-term program in 1988 to build a 
national highway network in several five-year plan periods. 
Since then, some expressways have been built from Guangzhou to 
Foshan, Xian to Lintong, Beijing to Tianjin and Beijing to 
Shijiazhuang. 
  Several expressways from Shanghai to Nanjing, Guangzhou to 
Shenzhen and Hangzhou to Ningbo are now under construction. 
  These expressways have given an impetus to the local 
economic 
development along these roads. Some industrial zones and 
economic development areas have arisen along the routes.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Trade union leaders 
today called on women workers to bring their roles into full 
play in the country's economic construction. 
  They were addressing the opening session of the Second 
National Women Workers Committee of the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions (ACFTU). 
  Xue Zhaojun, vice-chairman of the ACFTU, presided over the 
meeting and was elected chairman of the Second Women Workers 
Committee. 
  The National Women Workers Committee directly under the 
ACFTU 
was founded in 1991. So far, similar committees have been set 
up in all the 30 provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities across the country. 
  According to statistics from ten of the provinces, the 
economic returns created by women workers over the past five 
years amounted to 4.3 billion yuan. This came about because 
women workers provided 3.87 million suggestions, increased 
productivity, practiced economy and carried out technical 
innovations. 
  The meeting called for close attention to be paid to 
protecting the legal rights and special interests of women 
workers, and to raising their abilities. 
  Wei Jianxing, chairman of the ACFTU, and other union leaders 
also attended and made speeches at today's meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F>
(6392 6647 1987)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Addressing the national 
conference on agriculture which opened today, Minister of 
Agriculture Liu Jiang said that the objectives set for China's 
agriculture and rural economy are to steadily increase peasants' 
incomes and the effective supply of agricultural goods, and to 
deepen rural reform; revitalize agricultural production through 
science and technology; and continue to expedite agricultural 
and economic development in rural areas through stabilizing the 
party's policies for rural areas. 
  Those attending the conference are directors of departments 
(or bureaus) in charge of agriculture, animal husbandry, aquatic 
production, agricultural reclamation, township enterprises, and 
farm machinery in all provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities directly under the central government, and cities 
authorized to have independent economic plans; as well as 
representatives from various sectors. The meeting's main agenda 
is to examine the current situation of agricultural production 
and rural economy; study ways to implement the guidelines laid 
down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, the central conference on rural affairs, and the 
national economic conference; and draw up priorities of and 
major measures for deepening rural reform and accelerating 
agricultural and rural economic development in 1994 and beyond. 
  The specific targets that Liu Jiang put forward at the 
meeting for agricultural production and rural economic projects 
this year are: Grain output should exceed 450 million tonnes, 
cotton output should reach 4.85 million tonnes, and the output 
of oil-bearing crops should exceed 17 million tonnes; the output 
of meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables, and 
fruit should increase substantially; the gross agricultural 
output should increase 4 percent; revenue from township 
enterprises' sales and taxes on profits should increase 25 and 
19 percent, respectively; and peasants' per capita net income 
should increase 5 percent. 
  Liu Jiang stressed that this year the government will give 
priority to these three projects, namely increasing peasants' 
incomes, in reforming rural areas' economic structure, and in 
promoting rural economic development. Liu Jiang said: 
Increasing peasants' incomes constitutes the core of 
agriculture and rural economic work today as well as for the 
rest of the 1990's. The way to increase peasants' incomes is to 
deepen reform and speed up development. While paying attention 
to increasing peasants' incomes, we must continue to act firmly 
to reduce their burdens and accelerate various developmental 
projects meant to help the poor. To deepen the reform of the 
rural economic structure, the government will give priority to 
developing the market, improving the market system, providing 
stronger guidance, support, protection, and regulation for 
agriculture; and speeding up the development of economic 
operating mechanisms and managerial systems in rural areas 
compatible with the development of the socialist market economy. 
To ensure their economic development, the rural areas must make 
great efforts to develop efficient agriculture that produces 
quality goods in large quantities, to increase the output of 
nonstaple food, to extensively process agricultural goods and 
diversify their use, and to help township enterprises develop in 
a highly efficient [gao xiao 7559 2400], sustained, and healthy 
manner. 
  Liu Jiang said that agricultural and rural economic 
projects' 
emphasis should be placed on the following three areas: 
  First, steadily increasing grain and cotton output. Liu 
Jiang said: To ensure an adequate grain supply, we must 
stabilize acreage, improve the production mix, improve quality, 
and increase the unit yield this year. The sown acreage must be 
at least 1.65 billion mu. Efforts should be made to readjust 
the plan in various regions and the types of crops that they 
grow so that there will be large acreage for rice, wheat, corn, 
soybeans, and miscellaneous crops of good quality. Preferential 
measures should be taken so that the principal grain-producing 
regions can stabilize their grain production. As for cotton 
production, we must be determined to reverse the unfavorable 
trend, reinstate the former acreage, draw up rational plans, and 
increase the unit yield so that the level of a normal year can 
be maintained. 
  Second, we must make great efforts to develop the 
production of nonstaple foods. As for animal husbandry, we must 
stabilize pig production and increase the percentage of fowl as 
well as the beef and mutton output among the total meat 
production. As for fisheries, efforts should be made to develop 
aquatic breeding and to increase the output of well-known, 
special, and quality products as well as new products. The 
comprehensive control of diseases of prawns and other aquatic 
products must be properly organized. Efforts should be made to 
control prawn disease as quickly as possible. As for vegetable 
production, the size of acreage in the outskirts devoted to 
vegetables must be maintained, a system for ensuring vegetable 
acreage should be established, and efforts should be made so 
that vegetable acreage will not be misused. 
  Third, great efforts must be made to develop township and 
town enterprises. The development of these enterprises should 
be directed at increasing economic returns; the development 
should be compatible with the state's industrial policy; and the 
relationships between growth and returns, between quantity and 
quality, and between development and improvement must be 
properly handled. Township and town enterprises in the east 
should be restructured so that they can yield higher returns and 
are export-oriented. Their industrial structure and product mix 
must be readjusted so that their technology will be higher, the 
quality of their goods will be better, their operating size will 
be larger, and their returns will be higher. We must speed up 
the development of township and town enterprises in central and 
western China and speed up the formulation of the "Demonstrative 
Projects on Cooperation Between Township and Town Enterprises in 
Eastern and Western China." The first group of demonstrative 
projects must be finalized early this year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China's state land 
reclamation farms have scored big achievements in both 
agricultural and industrial production. 
  Last year, they reported good harvests in all fields. Cotton 
output reached 400,000 tons, 6.3 percent up over the previous 
year and providing 10 percent of the total in the country. 
Exports of soybeans from these areas accounted for 30 percent 
of the national total. 
  With the growth of agriculture, industry and the service 
sector, the state-owned farms scattered in various parts of the 
country such as Xinjiang, Heilongjiang and Yunnan produced a 
gross domestic product of 84.4 billion yuan (over 10 billion 
U.S. dollars) last year, with tax and profits amounting to 4 
billion yuan, respectively 15 and 30 percent more than the 
previous year. 
  The total farm production value is expected to be 26.3 
billion yuan (about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993, a 4 
percent increase over 1992. The farms' total production of 
grain and soybeans was over 10 million tons last year. 
  Industrial firms owned by the farms produced a total 
industrial value of 42.968 billion yuan (over 5.4 billion U.S. 
dollars) in 1993, up 12 percent over 1992, and the sales volume 
reached 40.967 billion yuan (about 5.12 billion U.S. dollars). 
  The service sector involving farm technology, commerce, real 
estate and tourism also made headway. 
  The farms have set up 675 export-oriented enterprises. 
  Last year, foreign investment in the farms reached 570 
million U.S. dollars, 117 percent higher than in the previous 
year. The farms exported 5 billion yuan worth of commodities, 
up by 8.8 percent over 1992.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China's township and 
village enterprises continued to grow at "a fast but stable 
pace" last year. 
  Qi Jingfa, director of the Rural Enterprise Administration 
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the rural firms 
earned a total profit of about 160 billion yuan (28 billion U.S. 
dollars according to the then official exchange rate) last year, 
while handing over to the state another 95 billion yuan (16.6 
billion U.S. dollars). 
  The figure represents an increase of 70 percent over the 
previous year's 150 billion yuan. 
  He put the total output value produced last year by the 
country's 20 million rural firms at an estimated 2,900 billion 
yuan, compared with 1,650 billion yuan in 1992, up 75.7 percent. 
  The official said the rural firms in the developing middle 
and western part of China expanded rapidly and in the developed 
coastal areas the rural firms made big progress in developing 
export- oriented economy and improving their efficiency and 
quality of products. 
  The total output value of exported goods manufactured by 
rural firms last year is estimated at 190 billion yuan, about 60 
percent more than in the previous year. They accounted for 45 
percent of the country's total commodities purchased for export. 
  The director said the scale of rural firms and total 
investment continued to grow, adding that the number of rural 
firms whose gross output value exceeded 100 million yuan 
increased from 256 in 1992 to 400 in 1993. 
  About 300 rural firms each sold more than 100 million yuan 
worth of their products in 1993. Nearly 100 firms became the 
biggest export goods producers among rural firms; each of them 
produced more than 100 million yuan worth of exported goods. 
  In addition, ownership and management reforms are 
progressing 
across the country, with 10 percent of the 20 million rural 
firms introducing a share-holding or cooperative system. 
  "Mergers, auctions, transfers of ownership, and filing for 
bankruptcy have been introduced on a trial basis among China's 
rural firms," said the official. 
  It is estimated that rural firms hired an additional six 
million rural laborers last year, increasing the total number of 
rural firm employees to 112 million. 
  Qi said that about 60 percent of the net per capita income 
of 
900 million Chinese farmers came from rural firms. 
  According to him, a lack of funds and specialized personnel 
is among outstanding problems facing the rural firms. 
  He warned that rural firms in China will have to face more 
challenges coming from growing competition in and outside China. 
  The introduction of the modern enterprise system to 
state-owned enterprises, one third of which are now running at a 
loss, will give full play to their advantages in technology, 
management, capital and specialized personnel. 
  In comparison, some advantages of rural firms will gradually 
be weakened. And the government's reform plans for this year, 
including reform of existing financial, taxation, investment and 
foreign trade systems, will have positive impacts on the rural 
firms in general. But some changes will affect rural firms 
adversely, the official said. 
  He cited as an example the fact that China is streamlining 
its tax rates, saying that rural firms will pay more taxes than 
before. 
  China's rural industry, which was a few years ago described 
by Deng Xiaoping as "a new force suddenly coming to the fore", 
has been growing at 30-50 percent each year since 1980. 
  Rural firms accounted for 31 percent of China's gross 
industrial output in 1992, becoming the fast growing sector of 
the country's economy. 
  Both the central and local governments have encouraged in 
recent years the development of rural enterprises. The policy 
was designed by the government to promote rural development, 
improve farmers' income and absorb the huge number of surplus 
rural laborers. 
  Surplus rural laborers in China now number about 100 
million, 
a figure expected to double by the year 2000. 
  China has set the total output value of the rural firms for 
the year 2000 at 7,600 billion yuan, with a profit of 750 
billion yuan and creation of 50 million new jobs.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 6 (AFP)--China indicated Thursday it 
had yet to agree to a U.S. proposal for further talks on a 
dispute over textile quotas that could cost the Chinese side 
some 1.2 billion dollars in lost exports. 
  "We are now seriously studying the invitation from the US 
side," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press 
briefing. 
  Washington wants to cut China's textile quota by 25 to 35 
percent to compensate for what it says are illegal exports 
trans-shipped through third countries. 
  An existing bilateral accord had been due to expire on 
December 31, but U.S. officials in Washington agreed to extend 
the deadline for imposing the quota cut to allow further talks 
in Washington in January. However, China has so far given no 
official confirmation that it will attend the talks. 
  "The officials of the two sides are now maintaining contacts 
with each other as regards some specific arrangements of the 
proposed visit," Wu said. "The Chinese side is always in favour 
of settling the question of Chinese exported textiles to the 
United States through negotiations," he added. 
  China exported 4.5 billion dollars' worth of textiles and 
clothing to the United States last year, accounting for some 
five percent of total exports. However U.S. officials have 
estimated that a further two billion dollars' worth was 
trans-shipped illegally.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress 
(NPC), expressed the conviction here today that there is great

in the past, and that since the two countries set up diplomatic 
ties two years ago, such contacts, especially economic and trade 
ones, have recorded rapid development. 
  Moreover, the two parliaments have conducted multi-level 
exchanges, which have played a positive role in promoting the 
mutual understanding and friendship between the two parliaments 
and two peoples, Qiao added. 
  The current visit here by Yi and his delegation will surely 
promote the development of Sino-ROK friendship, he said. 
  The ROK has made remarkable achievements in its national 
modernization, Qiao said. "As its neighbor, we are interested in 
its economic development," he added. 
  He said that China welcomes ROK enterprises to invest and 
seek co-operation here. 
  During the meeting Yi expressed gratitude to Qiao for his 
invitation. 
  Yi said the ROK and China have a long tradition of 
friendship 
and that he had been looking forward to the current trip.

  [Text] The government will probably table a second 
electoral bill in the Legislative Council [Legco] in March. No 
decision has yet been taken on the form of the bill, although 
this matter will be considered by British ministers when the 
governor, Chris Patten, visits London later this month. Cliff 
Bale has this report: 
  [Bale] The government tabled a partial electoral bill in the 
Legislative Council last month. It's expected to be enacted by 
the end of February. Government officials insist that a second 
bill, focusing on the more controversial issues relating to the 
1995 Legco elections, must be tabled shortly afterwards, which 
means probably in March. What's undecided is the form of the 
bill. There are several options: Mr. Patten's original 
blueprint, revised proposals put to China last year, or possibly 
some sort of compromise. This matter is set to be discussed 
during a meeting of the British Government's Cabinet Committee 
on Hong Kong, which according to British sources, will meet 
during Mr. Patten's visit to London later this month.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua today asked the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
(CAAC) to institute stricter management and more rigorous 
discipline to ensure safer air traffic. 
  At a meeting convened this morning at the headquarters of 
the 
CAAC, Zou Jiahua officially announced the appointment of the new 
leaders of the CAAC. Chen Guangyi, former provincial party 
secretary of Fujian, has been named as director of CAAC, while 
Jiang Zhuping, Yan Zhixiang, Li Zhao, Shen Yuankang and Bao 
Peide have been appointed as vice-directors. 
  In his speech, Zou reviewed the development of CAAC since 
the 
founding of New China, and praised the contributions of CAAC to 
the development of the national economy. 
  But he also pointed out that problems still exist in the 
country's civil aviation industry, and that CAAC should 
recognize its defects and improve its work. 
  Zou stressed that civil aviation work should continue to 
pursue the guiding principle of "safety first, normal flights 
and quality service," which was put forward by the late Premier 
Zhou Enlai. Even today the principle still bears immediate 
significance. 
  Zou reiterated the general purpose of civil aviation work, 
which is "serving the passengers, serving the development of the 
national economy," adding that passengers' opinions are the best 
gauge for CAAC's work. 
  Zou also urged the CAAC to develop a good style of work. The 
CAAC staff should be united, realistic, inventive and honest, he 
said. 
  CAAC's new director, Chen Guangyi, also made a speech at the 
meeting, saying that the CAAC has much to do to maintain air 
safety. All CAAC staff should be inspired with great enthusiasm 
to establish a good image in the world for CAAC. 
  Chen, aged 61, was vice-secretary and governor of Gansu 
Province until 1986 when he was transferred to be Communist 
Party secretary of Fujian Province. Last month he was appointed 
director of CAAC.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's 
Fujian Province has vowed to expand export-oriented economy this 
year, the "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS" [GOUJI SHANGBAO] reported. 
  According to Jia Qinglin, the provincial governor, Fujian's 
gross domestic product is expected to reach 91 billion yuan this 
year, an increase of at least 11 percent over last year. The 
province will invest 33 billion yuan in fixed assets, up 21.3 
percent. 
  The province plans to export seven billion U.S. dollars 
worth 
of goods this year and actually use 3.5 billion U.S. dollars of 
foreign investment, up 16.7 percent. Included will be direct 
foreign investment climbing to 3.2 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The professional newspaper noted that Fujian will turn 30 
percent of its foreign trade companies into companies with 
limited liability or joint stock companies this year. 
  Foreign trade organizations are encouraged to develop into 
economic entities and enterprise groups as joint ventures, 
cooperatives and share-holding and investment development 
companies. 
  One of the ancestral homes for overseas Chinese, Fujian will 
take advantage of its superior position close to Taiwan and Hong 
Kong to expand foreign economy this year.

Hanqing (female), who has already taken office. 
  The informed source said that the big personnel reshuffle at 
the leading level in Shenzhen this time is a rarely seen 
large-scale personnel adjustment since the founding of the 
special economic zone. The direct cause is that in the past two 
years, Shenzhen experienced a series of fires and explosions, 
exemplified by the big explosion at the dangerous goods 
warehouse at Clear Water River on 5 August 1993 and the big fire 
in the town of Kui Yong on 19 November the same year. 
  According to information, the investigation report on the 
big 
explosion at Clear Water River, [Qingshui He] prepared by the 
central investigation team, pointed out that Shenzhen City CPC 
Committee, Shenzhen City government, and Shenzhen City public 
security bureau all had responsibility for the incident. Since 
then, news on a reshuffle of the leading levels of Shenzhen have 
kept coming. The informed source said that the reshuffle this 
time is precisely an embodiment of the spirit of "taking 
responsibility," even though several personnel are retiring due 
to age, such as Li Guangzhen and Yang Guanghui. 
  Li Decheng, who is considered to be one of the candidates 
for 
vice mayor, was transferred from the north several years ago. 
The Shenzhen State-Owned Assets Management Company, of which he 
is the general manager, is in fact the chief housekeeper of 
state-run enterprises in the whole city, and has a very 
important position. He has recently been promoted to the 
position of member of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen City 
CPC Committee. It is generally held that he will replace Vice 
Mayor Li Guangzhen, to oversee the departments of commerce, 
foreign trade, and ports. Wang Ju, who is currently the party 
secretary of Longgang District, was a cadre in Shenzhen when 
Liang Xiang was the boss, and is considered an "elder having 
served three bosses," and he has continuously worked in the 
departments overseeing capital construction. He is also a 
Standing Committee member of the city party committee, and it is 
believed that he will take over from Vice Mayor Li Zhuanfang, 
who has overseen urban construction. Shao Hanqing, who is the 
new head of the propaganda department of the city party 
committee, has served as assistant to the mayor, and it is 
generally believed that she will be promoted to the Standing 
Committee of Shenzhen City CPC Committee upon the official 
retirement of Yang Guanghui to become the "strong woman" at the 
most senior level in the city. He Jinghuan, who has taken over 
from Liang Dajun, has already moved into his office, and his 
official position is party secretary of the city's public 
security bureau; it is expected that he will be promoted to the 
Standing Committee soon, and will be assigned to the post of the 
head of the public security bureau by the people's congress next 
year. 
  Among the outgoing officials, Li Guangzhen, Yang Guanghui, 
and Liang Dajun will retire, and they will probably go to the 
city people's congress or the city committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, to take some 
symbolic posts. Li Zhuanfang has yet to reach the age of 
retirement, and it has been alleged that she will come to Hong 
Kong to take charge of the Shenye Group Company. It is still 
undecided where Li Youwei will go after he leaves the posts of 
city party secretary and mayor. It has been alleged that he 
will go overseas. He left Shenzhen at the end of last month, 
and the official explanation is that he is in Beijing to 
"undergo surgery."

<F P=106> [Report on New Year interview with Jiang Xinxiong (5592 1800 </F>
7160), general manager of the China National Nuclear 
Corporation, by staff correspondent Lu Zhenhua (7120 2182 5478); 
place, date not given: "Jiang Xinxiong on China's Nuclear 
Industrial Development"] 
  [Text] The year behind us was one that saw the 
comprehensive development of the China National Nuclear 
Corporation. How strong is the momentum of development for the 
corporation in this new year of progress, both in reform and 
opening up and in economic development? With this question in 
mind -- a question that concerns many readers -- this 
correspondent interviewed Jiang Xinxiong, general manager of the 
China National Nuclear Corporation. 
  "Speeding up structural reform and promoting development, 
both in science and technology and in economic power -- these 
are the targets for our corporation in the new year," said Jiang 
Xinxiong by way of opening the conversation, and already holding 
forth: "Only thus can we match with the corporation's line of 
thinking on development, genuinely maintain our status as a 
hi-tech force commensurate with our country's nuclear status, 
build a new nuclear- powered electricity system and a nuclear 
industrial system capable of meeting the demands of national 
energy development, and create a diversified operating mode and 
production force with a greater market share. Only then can we 
make new contributions to the development of the nuclear 
industry in the next century." 
  Showing deep gratitude to the tens of thousands of the 
corporation's workers, he said: "In 1993, thanks of the 
efforts of one and all, we scored good results." Since its 
second grid- connected generation last March, the Taishan 
nuclear power plant has maintained steady, high-power 
operations, generating a total of 1.73 billion kwh by the end of 
last year, reaching 65 percent of its capacity. This feat has 
received good comments from experts inside and outside the 
country. The work design on the second-phase project is in full 
swing, and an almost 1,000-m tunnel has been bored. The No. 1 
generating unit of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant is operating 
normally, achieving its full-load operating capacity on 27 
November 1993. Jiang also stressed that the corporation's 
research and development department had achieved a number of 
results, nine of which were awarded Eureka Prizes at the 42d 
Brussels International Invention Fair. China's uranium 
enrichment technology and equipment also have achieved 
breakthroughs. China has built up a workshop producing 
components for an imported 900,000 kw water-pressurized reactor, 
which passed the examination of the importer. This signals 
China's ability to produce domestically and in a systematic 
fashion the fuel components for 300,000-, 600,000-, and 
900,000-kw nuclear-powered generators. The adoption of the 
underground submersion [rong jin 3310 3190] and piled submersion 
[ye dui jin 0396 1018 3190] methods in uranium mining cut the 
average cost by 30 percent. 
  Jiang Xinxiong also talked about the Chinese nuclear 
industry's effort to open overseas markets, the export of 
nuclear products for peaceful purposes, nuclear technology, and 
engineering projects. He said the project to export nuclear 
power plants to Pakistan had been going well since the 
completion of the first-phase concrete cement grouting last 
August, which had prompted talks between Pakistan and China on 
building a second 300,000-kw nuclear power generator. Contracts 
have been signed for the export of two 300,000-kw nuclear power 
generators to Iran. Last year, the foreign-exchange earning 
exports of the corporation's nuclear industry arm grew 75 
percent from the previous year. 
  General Manager Jiang changed the subject: "This year is a 
good opportunity for the corporation to speed up development." 
He also believed that deepening reforms and switching nuclear 
industrial firms' operating mechanisms are the keys. Through 
pilot projects in modern corporate systems and through moves to 
push enterprises toward the market, enterprises will grow 
stronger internally and workers will get incentives. Only thus 
can enterprises adjust to the new socialist market economy 
system. 
  "This year the corporation is focusing on large-scale 
projects. Civil engineering work will start for the two 
600,000-kw generators in the second phase of construction at the 
Taishan nuclear power plant, and the No. 1 generator at the Daya 
Bay nuclear power plant is in its final preparatory stages and 
will be in commercial operation in February. The corporation 
will further strengthen overseas cooperation, and will create 
conditions to propel toward the construction stage the export of 
nuclear power plants to Pakistan." 
  General Manager Jiang said: This year, the corporation will 
concentrate its energy on giving play to its superiority, 
actively participating in market competition, and opening up 
overseas and domestic markets. It will work toward the targets 
of raising the annual gross nuclear industrial output value by 
22.1 percent, and of raising the proportion of the gross output 
value of civilian products throughout the industry. He said 
with deep feeling: "This year happens to the 40th anniversary 
of the founding of China's nuclear industry. We should 
celebrate this glorious day with new successes!"

<F P=106> [By Central People's Radio Station correspondent Luo </F>
Guanxing (5012 6034 2502) and XINHUA correspondent Zheng 
Qingdong (6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- A national meeting 
convened by the State Council for keeping down grain and edible 
oil prices was held in Beijing on 25 December. Zhu Rongji, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee and vice premier of the State Council, emphatically 
pointed out at the meeting: Prices of grain and edible oil are 
the base prices of the market. Therefore, we must quickly curb 
the current rise of these prices and bring them back to a 
reasonable level so we can prevent a possible chain reaction. 
To achieve this, all localities must act as one body, 
coordinate their efforts, and immediately take effective 
measures to resolutely lower the current excessively high prices 
of grain and edible oil as well as ensure a stable market in 
order to create a favorable climate for the smooth institution 
of various reform measures in the next year, and for ensuring 
the economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy 
manner. 
  Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Chi Haotian, Ismail Amat, and other 
leading comrades of the State Council attended and spoke at the 
meeting. Also attending were responsible officials of various 
concerned departments and responsible comrades of concerned 
departments of the people's governments of all provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities. 
  The meeting was presided over by State Councillor Luo Gan, 
who is also secretary general of the State Council. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Since November, prices of grain and edible 
oil have risen by a large margin -- from the coastal areas to 
the interior of the country, from the south to the north -- 
rapidly spreading to many localities across the country. In 
some localities, this might have been caused by the inadequate 
supply of grain, low grain stocks, untimely shipping of grain, 
and other factors. But judging from the overall situation, this 
has been primarily caused by psychological factors, speculation, 
and other temporary factors. This year, China's grain output 
has been abundant, grain stocks have been ample, and grain 
transportation has been ensured. As long as we provide better 
guidance; unify our thinking; eradicate the erroneous idea that 
"price increases do not matter," as is harbored by comrades of 
some localities and departments; and employ various kinds of 
propaganda to clear misunderstanding and doubts from the masses 
minds, we will completely be able to swiftly keep down grain 
prices and return them to a reasonable level. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: Some feel they no longer need to 
watch grain prices now that control of grain prices has been 
lifted. This is a misunderstanding of the market economy. 
Decontrolling the grain market and prices does not mean we no 
longer need to pay attention to them, and certainly does not 
mean we can let things go their own way. According to the law 
of market supply and demand, exercising regulation and control 
of grain prices -- which affect the national economy, the 
people's livelihood, and social stability -- is a common 
practice in market economy countries as well as an important 
part of our macroregulation and control efforts. 
  Zhu Rongji stated: The current efforts to keep down the 
prices of grain and edible oil and to stabilize the market are 
an important decision made by the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council; this decision must be resolutely implemented. 
Localities across the country should act as one body and quickly 
carry out the decision. First, by the end of this year, 
state-owned grain stores should lower the selling price of grain 
to around the level established in the state's plan for 1994; 
localities who fail to reach this level must not take the 
opportunity to raise grain prices. Second, grain prices should 
be further appropriately lowered before the Spring Festival to 
provide room for the readjustment of grain prices scheduled to 
be made next year. State- owned grain stores should fully serve 
as a major player in regulating and controlling the grain 
market; they should list the lowered prices and should supply 
grain without setting restrictions. While the purchase price of 
grain stays high, state-owned grain departments should not race 
to purchase grain at high prices, but should insist on 
purchasing grain at originally established prices. They should 
realize the grain supply is ample and the purchase price of 
grain will decrease after the selling price is lowered and 
stabilized. The grain and oil currently to be sold at lowered 
prices was purchased at previous prices; therefore, selling them 
at the lowered prices will not increase grain departments' 
losses. 
  The meeting urged all concerned departments of the State 
Council to meticulously organize and coordinate work on keeping 
down the prices of grain and oil. It urged grain departments to 
organize cadres and workers -- group by group and from time to 
time -- to study the macromanagement of grain circulation under 
the conditions of the socialist market economic system, and to 
improve their business management skills to ensure a good job in 
circulating grain. The meeting called on the railway and other 
transportation departments to give priority to and fully assure 
the transportation of grain, edible oil, and non staple food; it 
called on local people's governments at all levels as well as 
their grain, price, industry and commerce, taxation, and other 
concerned departments to tighten supervision and inspection of 
local grain markets and to properly manage them; it resolutely 
urged cracking down on unlicensed grain dealing, attempting to 
drive up grain prices, speculation, and attempting to manipulate 
grain markets in order to ensure the grain market remains stable 
and the objectives of price lowering are achieved within the 
specified period. 
  The meeting emphasized: While stabilizing the grain prices 
and the market, we should effectively strengthen our leadership 
over agricultural production, take effective measures to ensure 
good agricultural production this winter and the coming spring, 
and, following the bumper agricultural harvests we have this 
year, strive to reap another good agricultural harvest next year. 
  Bai Meiqing, vice minister of internal trade, briefed the 
meeting on the "Opinions on the Arrangement for Keeping Down the 
Prices of Grain and Edible Oil and for Stabilizing the Market," 
which was prepared by the State Planning Commission, the State 
Commission for Economics and Trade, the Ministry of Internal 
Trade, and the State Grain Storage Bureau. He also set forth a 
plan for keeping down the price of grain and edible oil and for 
stabilizing the market; he urged grain departments at all levels 
to go all out and take the lead in keeping down the price of 
grain and edible oil, to endeavor to ensure a good job in grain 
and edible oil processing and transportation, to supply grain 
and oil in a timely manner at the announced lowered prices 
without setting restrictions, to not set limits on the amounts 
of grain and oil to be sold, and to ensure that grain and edible 
oil are not out of stock. He also urged grain departments to 
ensure grain and edible oil supplies for key large and medium 
cities as well as for poor areas, and to ensure timely supplies 
at wholesale prices for the cafeterias of universities and 
special secondary schools. 
  The meeting coordinated and decided the procedures for 
lowering the price of edible oil and the standard levels of the 
price of edible oil. Based on production-supply-marketing 
balance situations and the price relations in specific 
localities, the meeting decided the price parities for 
respective localities and for grains and edible oils of various 
categories.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Luo Zhiling, vice 
chairman of the State Planning Commission, today briefed the 
capital's press circles on price situation in the market, 
pointing out that the government would take effective measures 
to stabilize prices in the course of deepening reform. 
  Grain and edible oil prices have risen sharply since 
November 
because of anticipation of higher prices, rumors, untimely 
shipping, speculation by a handful of units, and other irregular 
factors. The price rise has also spread to pork and other major 
nonstaple food items. The rise in grain and edible oil prices 
has triggered panic buying in some localities, exacerbating 
people's fear of inflation. Following the situation with great 
interest, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and 
State Council have personally conducted investigations and 
solicited views from the masses. A number of measures to 
stabilize grain and edible oil prices have been announced one 
after another since mid-December. In particular, following the 
25 December work conference convened by the State Council for 
keeping down grain and edible oil prices, governments at all 
levels took the matter seriously. They promptly took action by 
convening special meetings to make specific arrangements 
requiring retailers to mark the prices of grain and edible oil. 
The State Planning Commission, Internal Trade Ministry, 
Railways Ministry, State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce, and other departments have either convened meetings or 
issued circulars to outline specific arrangements for fully 
utilizing major channels of circulation; for organizing the 
procurement, allocation, shipping, and marketing of grains; and 
for stepping up the monitoring and supervision over market 
prices. 
  At present, state-owned grain shops in large and 
medium-sized 
cities across the country -- including some prefectures, cities, 
county towns, and market towns -- sell grain at uniform marked 
prices with unlimited supply. The prevailing marked prices in 
the localities are as follows: standard flour, 0.55 to 0.65 yuan 
a jin; Class-2 standard polished long-grained rice, 0.65 yuan a 
jin; and rapeseed oil, 3.2 to 3.5 yuan a jin. The state has 
sold 5 billion jin of reserve grains and 32,000 metric tons of 
reserve commodity edible oil. Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, 
Beijing, and many other provinces and cities have also sold 
local reserves to stabilize grain and edible oil prices in their 
localities. To ensure implementation of the policy and measures 
of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, local price, 
grain, industry and commerce departments have dispatched 
personnel in force to monitor and supervise prices in the 
market. In Beijing alone, over 600 monitors make daily rounds 
of the grain stores. Thanks to the aforementioned measures, 
grain and edible oil prices have dropped in some localities. 
  The state will implement a series of major reforms involving 
taxes, exchange rates, finance, banking, and investment in the 
New Year. Luo Zhiling pointed out: Implementation of these 
reforms will help build the basic framework of a socialist 
market economy. The steps and scope of reform will be big, 
covering all sectors and all trades. In formulating the 
program, we have taken the interest of all quarters -- the 
immediate interest of the broad masses of the people in 
particular -- into consideration. Generally speaking, reform 
will not trigger widespread price hikes. In case it has some 
impact on certain sectors or commodities, the state will pay 
adequate attention to them and spare no efforts in devising 
reform plans and supporting measures to soften the impact on 
society. The total supply and demands will remain basically 
balanced in 1994. In the current year, we have plentiful grain 
resources; the grain output was 30 billion jin higher than in 
the previous year and we are well-stocked in grain. The state 
will take a variety of measures to increase the supply of edible 
vegetable oil. Supply and demand of home appliances, clothing 
items, and other articles for daily use are basically balanced 
and, in some cases, supply outstrips demand. We are entirely 
capable of ensuring adequate supply and keeping the prices 
relatively stable. The broad masses of the people can set their 
minds at rest. 
  As for additional measures the government will take to keep 
the prices stable, Luo Zhiling said: We have made initial 
progress in stabilizing grain and edible oil prices. However, 
governments at all levels will continue to keep a close watch on 
the market. They will step up administration and monitoring of 
the market around the holidays to uncover problems and solve 
them in a timely fashion. The state will continue to organize 
well procurement, allocation, shipping, and marketing of grain, 
edible oil prices, and other essential materials and sell 
reserve grains to further bring down prices. To step up control 
and supervision of the prices, we will, in the near future, ask 
the State Council to publish "Provisions Concerning Marking the 
Prices of Commodities and Services" and "Procedures for 
Supervision Over the Prices of Daily Necessities and Services in 
Urban Areas." Price departments at all levels should organize 
and step up supervision and inspections in accordance with the 
two sets of regulations. They should earnestly investigate and 
prosecute illegal activities involving exorbitant profits by 
driving up prices and disrupting the market, conscientiously 
protect the interests of the consumers, and see to it that 
reform and opening up go forward smoothly. As we stabilize 
market prices, localities and departments must not raise prices 
or service fees under one excuse or another. State-run 
enterprises and establishments must take the lead in 
implementing, in an exemplary manner, the state laws and 
policies on prices and give full play to their role as the main 
channels for regulating goods and stabilizing prices. They must 
not take advantage of reform to drive up prices for the benefit 
of small groups. Violators, once caught, will be punished 
severely. We also hope that the broad masses of people will, as 
masters of the state, step up public supervision of the market 
prices.

<F P=106> ["Trends of Academic Studies on International Issues" column </F>
by reporter Liao Xianwang (1675 0341 2489): "Increase National 
Strength, Coexist Peacefully--China Institute for International 
Strategic Studies Holds Annual Meeting"] 
  [Text] On 21 December, the China Institute for 
International Strategic Studies held its 1993 annual meeting in 
Beijing. More than 100 people attending the meeting reviewed 
the international situation in the past year and warmly 
discussed future trends. 
  The experts held that peace and development remained the two 
major themes of the contemporary world. In the past year, some 
tendencies are noteworthy: First, the economy in the East Asian 
region rose, and the center of gravity of the world economy was 
moving toward the Asia-Pacific region. Against the background 
of extensive recession in the world economy, East Asia was 
becoming the locomotive of the world economy. Second, some old 
regional hot spots eased, but new hot spots emerged, and 
turbulence will continue to spread. In the past year, 
breakthroughs were made on some old hot-spot issues, and the 
most important event was the conclusion of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement. However, from the Outer Caucasus 
to the Balkans, a large number of territorial, ethnic, and 
religious conflicts were emerging. The Russian situation and 
its future strategic tendency also attracted serious attention. 
Third, there was a multitude of contradictions within the 
Western world, and the leading position of the United States was 
being continuously weakened. The contradictions among the 
United States, Japan, and Western Europe developed further. The 
process of multipolarization in the world was accelerating. The 
domestic and foreign policies of the United States were still 
undergoing adjustments. Fourth, the world was in a period of 
adjusting military strategies, and the main tendency was: The 
strategies mainly aimed at major wars were being replaced by 
strategies mainly aimed at minor wars; preparations against 
enemies in reality were shifted to preparations against 
potential rivals in larger numbers; the building of large strong 
forces was being shifted to the building of modern crack troops 
able to react rapidly. Fifth, China's economic development and 
social stability enhanced the nation's international status. 
  When looking to future tendencies in the international 
situation, people expressed the following opinions: 
  First, hegemonism and power politics remain in the world, 
but 
the process of multipolarization has been quickened. In 
particular, Germany and Japan are seeking the status of world 
powers, and this tendency will become more obvious in the future. 
  Second, the danger of "neo-interventionism" will increase. 
Because regional conflicts will occur frequently, international 
interventions and peace-keeping actions will substantially 
increase. This will provide opportunities for some big powers to 
seek hegemony. The struggle against interventionism will be a 
major aspect of international struggle in the future. 
  Third, the strength of the developing countries will 
continue 
to grow. The regional economic organizations in Asia, Latin 
America, and Africa will further develop. Economic cooperation 
will bring about political coordination and will give rise to 
some regional dialogue organizations. They will share common 
interests in safeguarding independence, opposing power politics, 
and striving for the establishment of an international political 
and economic order. 
  The comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed that 
in 
the contemporary world, comprehensive national strength will 
form the foundation for a country's strategy, and that economic 
strength is the foundation of comprehensive national strength. 
Therefore, we must continue to carry out the party's basic line 
of taking economic construction as the central task, properly 
handle our own affairs, and join the people throughout the world 
in striving for the establishment of an international political 
and economic order characterized by peaceful coexistence, 
equality, and mutual benefit.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wu Zhiqiang: "U.S. Steps Up Preparation for </F>
Clinton European Trip"] 
  [Text] Washington, January 4 (XINHUA) -- In the run-up to 
Bill Clinton's first presidential visit to Europe, the U.S. 
Administration is stepping up its preparation for the historic 
trip. 
  Clinton, who leaves here Saturday [8 January] night, met 
Monday with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Strobe 
Talbott, the would-be deputy to Christopher, on the tour that 
will include stops in Brussels, Prague, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva. 
  The President is scheduled to meet with specialists on 
European and Russian affairs Tuesday night. 
  At the center of Clinton's trip would be the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization's enlargement, reforms in Russia, Moscow's 
outstanding nuclear differences with neighboring Ukraine and the 
now-slowed-down Middle East peace process. 
  The strong support for Russia's ultranationalist Liberal 
Democratic Party in the recent parliamentary elections has 
prompted the Eastern and Central European countries to hasten 
the process of joining the NATO. 
  Washington, afraid of putting Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin 
in a worse footing, is against immediately accepting countries 
like Poland and the Czech Republics into NATO. 
  In what it calls the "partnership for peace" program, the 
United States champions a gradual process in which all former 
Warsaw Pact member countries could join NATO's military training 
and other cooperation projects without security guarantee from 
the Transatlantic Alliance. 
  This approach was criticized by Polish President Lech Walesa 
as "short-sighted and irresponsible." 
  However, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General 
John Shalikashvili, a former NATO commander, said "We cannot 
just simply move the Berlin Wall a few hundred miles eastward." 
  "It is important that we are very clear that... [ellipses as 
received] We are not building a system that is against someone, 
because otherwise... [ellipses as received] We would just be 
fueling the paranoia that might exist," the general said. 
  On Thursday, Shalikashvili and Madeleine Albright, 
Washington's ambassador, will go to East Europe, both added 
items in their itinerary, to soothe their concerns over the U.S. 
plan on NATO enlargement. 
  Clinton will stop in Prague, the Czech Capital, and meet 
with 
Eastern European leaders. 
  His next stop is Moscow, where he will have a second summit 
meeting with Yeltsin to reiterate Washington's support for 
Russia's political and economic reforms. 
  Clinton reportedly planned a stop in Ukraine, but the former 
Soviet Republic's parliamentary decision to retain the nuclear 
weapons on its soil kicked the visit out of Clinton's schedule. 
  There has been wide reports of a three-way meeting in Moscow 
among Clinton, Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, 
but the White House said that was still up in the air. 
  At the State Department, Spokesman Mike McCurry said a 
trilateral meeting of U.S., Russian and Ukrainian officials had 
started Monday on the nuclear issues. 
  McCurry said a meeting between Clinton and Kravchuk "depends 
on the kind of progress they can make in talks on these nuclear 
disarmament issues." 
  After a stop in Minsk, the Belarus Capital, Clinton will go 
to Geneva, Switzerland, for talks with Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad to revive the Middle East peace talks. 
  Prior to his departure to Europe, Clinton will make a speech 
on Thursday on foreign policy, raising the curtain for the 
10-day five- country trip. 
  On Sunday afternoon, the President will make a speech in 
Brussels on Washington's European policy. 
  "It is an important opportunity for him to articulate his 
sense of U.S.-European relations and the American role in Europe 
after the Cold War," a senior administration officials said last 
month. 
  Clinton will answer "What is the new agenda for 
Transatlantic 
cooperation? Why do we care about each other? What do we see 
as the challenges to our interests? and what he sees as the 
American role in helping meet those challenges," the official 
said during a background briefing to foreign reporters.

  [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told visiting Azerbaijan 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov here today that China puts great 
importance on expanding its ties with Azerbaijan. 
  Gasanov arrived here this morning for a three-day official 
visit as Qian's guest. 
  Qian said, as long ago as 2000 years, the famous "silk road" 
built a friendship bridge between the two countries. After 
Azerbaijan's independence and the setting up of China-Azerbaijan 
diplomatic ties, the bilateral relations have entered a new 
phase of development. 
  In the past two years the two sides have built up ties in 
every field and on every level, and the bilateral relationship 
has got a good beginning, he said. 
  Qian noted that China and Azerbaijan are both Asian 
countries, and that they share common interests on many fronts. 
  China will try to develop long-term and steady relations 
with 
Azerbaijan on the basis of the five principles of co-existence, 
Qian said. 
  The country will, with the help of Azerbaijan, enrich China- 
Azerbaijan ties and expand the mutually beneficial co-operation 
in economy, trade, technology and culture. 
  "We support Azerbaijan in its efforts to maintain its 
independence and sovereignty, and in its efforts to develop its 
economy," Qian said. 
  China is also willing to expand its co-operation with 
Azerbaijan in world affairs, he said, adding that the country 
supports all efforts aimed at bringing reasonable and peaceful 
settlements to hot-spots the world over. 
  Gasanov expressed agreement with Qian's view. He said his 
country attaches importance to its relations with China and that 
it is willing to expand its friendly ties of co-operation with 
China in every field. 
  During the meeting Gasanov briefed Qian on the latest 
developments in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
  Qian expressed deep concern about the escalating conflict 
and 
the heavy casualties and material losses it has incurred. 
  China holds that country-to-country conflicts should be 
settled through peaceful negotiations, Qian said. It sincerely 
hopes the parties concerned will settle the conflict through 
negotiations as soon as possible. This is not only in the 
interests of the two peoples but conducive to the region's peace 
and development. 
  "We are willing to promote, with the joint efforts of all 
sides, the proper settlement of the conflict at an early date," 
Qian stressed. 
  Qian also briefed Gasanov on China's ties with other member 
countries of the Commonwealth of Independence States. 
  After the meeting Qian and Gasanov signed four agreements on 
behalf of their respective governments: An agreement on 
consultations between the two foreign ministries, a consular 
agreement, an agreement on visa exemption for public service 
passport holders, and an agreement on visa exemption tourist 
groups.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren expressed the hope here today that 
China-Azerbaijan cooperation could be further expanded and its 
level enhanced. 
  During a meeting with visiting Azerbaijan Foreign Minister 
Gasan Gasanov at the Great Hall of the People this morning, Rong 
said it was the common aspiration of the two countries to 
further promote the development of bilateral economic and trade 
ties with substance. 
  He proposed that bilateral cooperation be developed in 
various ways and some joint ventures be set up in accordance 
with the actual needs of both sides. 
  "The Chinese Government encourages its departments, 
companies 
and enterprises to carry out multi-form economic cooperation 
with Azerbaijan," he said, while voicing the hope that the 
Azerbaijan Government would in turn create a favorable 
environment for this cooperation. 
  Reviewing the bilateral ties, Rong said the Chinese people 
cherish fond feelings toward the Azerbaijan people and that 
bilateral ties have marked progress in every field since the 
setting-up of diplomatic relations. 
  In response, Gasanov said the Azerbaijan leaders put China 
on 
the list of priority countries with which Azerbaijan should 
develop ties. 
  The two countries should foster even closer ties in more 
fields, he said, adding that the Azerbaijan Government speaks 
highly of China's policy of non-interference in other countries' 
internal affairs and of developing friendly ties on the basis of 
the five principles of co-existence. 
  During the meeting, Rong also briefed the visitors on 
China's 
reform and opening to the outside world. 
  He expressed the belief that Azerbaijan's economy would pick 
up quickly, given a stable domestic situation and a favorable 
international environment. 
  This morning, Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation, also met Gasanov. They exchanged views on 
the expansion of bilateral economic and trade relations.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that China attaches great importance to its 
relations with Azerbaijan and is looking forward to a visit to 
China by Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev. 
  "The exchange of visits by high-level officials will surely 
promote the development of our bilateral ties," Li told visiting 
Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and his party here 
this afternoon. 
  In response, Gasanov said his country gives priority to its 
ties with China and that President Aliyev is keen to visit China. 
  China and Azerbaijan are both Asian countries and the 
friendly contacts between the two peoples date back to the "silk 
road" period of 2000 years ago, Li noted. 
  Recalling his visit to Azerbaijan some 40 years ago, Li said 
his memory of that visit is as fresh as ever, and the Baku 
oilfield is well known among the Chinese people. 
  Li noted that the Chinese government gave Azerbaijan prompt 
recognition after it gained independence, and the two countries 
soon established ambassadorial-level diplomatic ties. 
  "For the past two years our bilateral relations have marked 
steady and healthy development. I am satisfied with that," the 
Chinese premier said. 
  During the meeting Gasanov conveyed to Li the regards from 
President Aliyev to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other 
Chinese leaders. 
  The current Azerbaijan-China ties are good, Gasanov said, 
adding that his country is willing to co-operate with China in 
every field. 
  He also expressed his admiration for the progress China has 
made through reforms while maintaining its stability.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States share a wide range of common interests. Both sides should 
seize the opportunity created by the formal meeting between 
Chinese and U.S. head of governments to help maintain the sound 
momentum which has begun in relations, Premier Li Peng told a 
group of U.S. senators here this afternoon. 
  "China's door is open to you. I hope that after this visit 
you will know more about China and further explore many 
possibilities for bilateral trade and economic cooperation," Li 
said during the meeting with a U.S. Senate delegation led by 
Bennett Johnston, chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. 
  Li said a year of joint efforts has led to active 
improvements in Sino-American relations, especially as the 
formal conference between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Seattle was of great importance for 
the development of bilateral relations. 
  "To catch this opportunity to strengthen communications and 
cooperation in different fields and on different levels will not 
only be in the interests of our two countries and peoples but be 
helpful to the peace, stability and development of the whole 
world, and of Asia in particular," Li said. 
  Li said the differences between the two countries should be 
resolved on the basis of equality, mutual respect and seeking 
common points while preserving differences. 
  "The differences are in a less important position than that 
of our common interests, and should not affect bilateral 
relations on the whole," Li said. 
  He said China and the United States have common interests in 
preserving world peace and Asian stability, and promoting 
mutually beneficial cooperation in every field. 
  Li said that the trade and economics of the two countries 
are 
comlementary, and it is in the best interests of both sides to 
enhance cooperation in these aspects. 
  As China is undergoing a large-scale modernization and 
foreign capital is entering more spheres, "we are glad to see 
that American enterprises in the manufacturing industries as 
well as some leading securities firms have ventured into China," 
he said. 
  Li held that China welcomes entrepreneurs from the United 
States as well as from other countries to invest in China's 
coal, electricity, oil, telecommunication and railway industries. 
  He said China has a huge market. In the next seven years 
China's imports will hit the 700 billion U.S. dollar-mark, which 
will render Sino-U.S. Cooperation in trade and economy promising. 
  "We believe that foresighted American statesmen and 
entrepreneurs will not remain aloof from this market or turn a 
deaf ear to this precious opportunity," Li said. 
  During the meeting Johnston said that now people have more 
reason to believe that it is in the best interests of both 
countries to build a strong and close relationship. 
  He said the development of bilateral trade will be 
invigorated when a permanent and formal relationship is set up 
between China and the United States and that the 
most-favored-nation trade status is no longer debated annually. 
  Johnston said that he will, as usual, do his best to promote 
bilateral, especially economic and trade, relations. 
  The delegation, which arrived in Beijing 4 January at the 
invitation of the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs, consists 
of 25 persons, including seven senators. It was reported that 
the visit in China by such a huge U.S. Senate delegation has 
been quite unusual. 
  As scheduled, during their five-day tour of China they will 
head for Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong 
Province, after winding up their stay in Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Visiting chairman of 
the U.S. Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee Bennett 
Johnston said here today that it is "almost unthinkable not to 
give China MFN [most-favored nation] status" while China's 
economy is growing rapidly and the human rights situation here 
is improving. 
  He also called for the lifting of all U.S. sanctions on 
China 
so that American companies can compete in the growing China 
market. 
  Johnston made the remarks at a press briefing here this 
evening at the end of his delegation's two-day visit to Beijing. 
  During his stay here, Johnston said, the delegation had met 
Chinese Premier Li Peng and chairman of the Standing Committee 
of the Chinese National People's Congress Qiao Shi. 
  It also had discussions with Chinese officials from the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, the State 
Science and Technology Commission, and the Ministries of 
Electric Power and Coal, he said. 
  The China-U.S. relationship is the "single most important 
relationship", he said, adding that China is the fastest-growing 
nation and in the fastest-growing region in the world. 
  China has a great need for U.S. technology, he noted. "We 
wish more American technology and more U.S. dollars could be 
involved in China," he said. 
  He predicted that China would be part of the very 
competitive 
world market of the next century. "The nations successful 
economically in the next century will be those who compete 
successfully in China's market," he said. 
  On China's MFN status he stressed, "it is almost unthinkable 
not to give China MFN status."

<F P=106> ["Short commentary" by Cang Mang (5547 5413): "A Wise Move"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Government journal, FEDERAL REGISTER, 
recently published the findings of an investigation which 
acknowledged that the Qinghe sock factory did not export its 
products to the United States, and that this is unlikely to 
happen in the future. Hence, the so-called "case of Beijing's 
Prison No. 1 exporting goods to the United States" -- which was 
concocted in 1991 by Wolf, a member of the U.S. House of 
Representatives -- has finally come to light. 
  In Sino-U.S. trade and other bilateral ties, problems and 
misunderstandings of one kind or another may occur; this is 
quite natural. The problems can be resolved easily and 
misunderstandings can eventually be dispelled as long as the two 
sides respect each other and hold consultations based on equal 
footing, with sincerity and cooperation. With a serious and 
earnest attitude, the U.S. Federal Government, in cooperation 
with the Chinese Government, meticulously investigated and 
eventually drew realistic conclusions on the case, which had 
remained "unsettled" for more than two years. 
  On the question of prison goods, the policy of the Chinese 
Government is clear and its measures are resolute. As early as 
10 October 1991, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economy and 
the Ministry of Judiciary jointly promulgated the "Regulations 
Reiterating the Ban on Export of Prison Goods." According to 
the provisions, prison enterprises do not have the right and are 
not allowed to carry out activities involving foreign trade and 
economy. Responsible officials of the Chinese departments 
concerned, emphasized this position on numerous occasions. 
Since the signing in Washington on 7 August 1992 of the 
"Memorandum of Understanding on Banning Exports of Prison Goods" 
between the representatives of China and the United States, the 
Chinese side has strictly enforced the relevant provisions of 
the memorandum. Meanwhile, China's concerned departments also 
offered positive cooperation to U.S. political figures, 
including Representative Wolf, during their visits to Beijing's 
Prison No. 1. All of this fully indicates the sincerity of the 
Chinese side in resolving the question of prison goods. 
  In recent years, U.S. Government and public figures have 
visited China one after another. Through what they have seen 
and heard, most of them have gained a practical understanding 
and an objective and a just appraisal of the tremendous progress 
made in China's reform over the past decade or so, which has 
further increased their confidence in the future of Sino-U.S. 
ties. Nevertheless, a handful of people still have prejudices 
against China. In spite of the facts, they spare no efforts to 
create trouble, mix up black and white, confuse the public, and 
harm Sino-U.S. relations, eventually resulting in an unpleasant 
conclusion. We hold that there should be more sincerity and 
less prejudice in order to improve Sino-U.S. ties. 
  Since the Sino-U.S. Seattle summit, a good development trend 
has appeared in Sino-U.S. relations. China is the largest 
developing nation, while the United States is the most developed 
nation in the world, and the two sides share a wide range of 
common interests. As long as both sides are sincere and make 
efforts to increase mutual understanding and trust, we believe 
that the obstacles in bilateral relations can be removed and 
that Sino-U.S. ties can be established on a solid basis.

environment. 
  R.G. Hollifield, deputy general manager of the Sdupac 
company 
[name as received], and nine Chinese heads of different kinds of 
firms in the zone received the special awards here today. 
  Sdupac is the first joint venture the U.S. Dupont Company 
has 
funded in China. It went into production in November 1992. 
  The company mainly produces a weed killer called 
"nongdeshi". 
  Since its founding it has paid close attention to abiding by 
the local rules and regulations concerning safety, health and 
environmental protection in both its production and sales. 
  Efforts have also been made to guarantee the quality of its 
products. It sets aside 16 percent of its fixed assets for 
environmental protection, including the planting of trees and 
grass around the factory. 
  An official of the Pudong New Area said that one of the 
goals 
of the zone's development is to maintain a fine natural 
environment. All the new structures of the Pudong New Area will 
be extended into the next century. Sdupac has set a good 
example for other foreign- funded companies in the zone in 
protecting the environment.

<F P=106> ["Year-Ender" by Huang Pengnian: "African Economic </F>
Situation in 1993"] 
  [Text] Addis Ababa, January 3 (XINHUA) -- 1993 has seen 
Africa make a step forward to the economic integration aiming at 
boosting the intra-African cooperation in developing a 
sustainable economy on the continent. 
  With respect to the African economic integration, an 
encouraging sign is that the number of the countries has 
increased to 34 that have ratified the treaty on the 
establishment of the African Economic Community, which was 
signed by the African leaders in Abuja, new capital of Nigeria, 
in June 1991. With the ratification by one more country, the 
treaty will come into force. 
  Besides, progress has also been made in regional economic 
integration in 1993 in the western, eastern and southern parts 
of the continent. Treaties on the establishment of regional 
common markets have been signed to facilitate the inter-regional 
trade and economic development. 
  In order to promote the intra-Africa trade, the African 
Development Bank (ADB) took the initiative in establishing the 
"African Export-Import Bank" in Cairo, while the U.N. 
secretary-general has proposed the establishment of a commodity 
diversification fund for Africa. 
  Those efforts have obviously demonstrated the eagerness and 
determination of Africans to overcome the economic crisis and 
step up the economic development on the continent. 
  As regards the economic situation of Africa in 1993, many 
countries have appeared to set on course to harvest the benefits 
of peace. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) 
estimated that the economic growth in Ethiopia might reach 9.3 
percent, 5.3 percent in Mozambique and 7.1 percent in Uganda due 
to the relative peace and stability in the countries. 
  However, the economic situation in Africa as a whole was 
still marked by a meagre growth in 1993. According to an ECA 
preliminary estimation, African economy grew by only 1.4 percent 
in the year, representing an improvement over the 0.7 percent 
growth of 1992. This is barely half of the regional population 
growth rate. 
  Analysts pointed out, in addition to the deep-seated 
problems 
including lack of domestic resources, poor infrastructure and 
domestic political deficiencies, there are three major factors 
that are hindering the African economic growth. 
  First of all, it is the continuing civil conflicts and 
political crises in several countries that restrained the 
economic growth. For example, the economic growth in Zaire is 
estimated to have dropped by 4 percent in 1993 following a more 
severe decline of 12 percent in the previous year because of the 
political unrest resulting from disputes over democratization 
process in the country. Nigeria's economy may have only grown by 
about 3.7 percent in 1993, far below the annual average of 6.2 
percent in the 1988-1992 period due to political upheaval. 
  The natural disasters, especially the drought that struck 
eastern and southern Africa in the year, are another factor that 
has suppressed the economic growth. Due to the worst drought, 
Zimbabwe's economy is estimated to grow by 1.4 percent in 1993 
as compared with the 8.5 percent growth in 1992. Parts of 
Ethiopia and Eritrea have also experienced crop failures because 
of the drought. 
  The third factor is the unfavorable international economic 
environment. The weak growth in major industrial countries led 
to a sluggish demand for main African products. And the weak 
demand in turn led to the continuing fall in prices of fuel and 
non-fuel commodities. As result, Africa's export earnings are 
estimated to have shrunk by about 2.7 percent to 72 billion U.S. 
dollars in 1993, following a drop of 1.1 percent in 1992. 
  Besides, external debt has further deteriorated in 1993. 
According to the ECA, the share of multi-lateral debt of Africa 
in aggregated debt stock has risen to 24.2 percent in 1993 
compared to 20.5 percent in 1992 and 19.5 percent in 1991. This 
shows that Africa's external debt will be above 275.15 billion 
U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  Meanwhile, external resources flowing to Africa are 
declining. According to the latest estimation of the World Bank, 
sub-Saharan Africa's share of total official development 
assistance of the bank has fallen from 37.1 percent in 1990 to 
36.3 percent in 1992. Net lending commitments by the World Bank 
to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 percent or 1.2 billion 
U.S. dollars in its last financial year. Non-project lending to 
sub-Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to 455 million U.S. 
dollars from 895 million U.S. dollars the previous year. 
  IMF also reported a downturn in lending to Africa in its 
latest financial year. The disbursements totalled some 525 
million U.S. dollars in the year ending April 30, 1993 compared 
with some one billion U.S. dollars for the previous year, a fall 
of nearly 50 percent. 
  All those factors have added more difficulties to the lack 
of 
resources of African countries that need capital to develop 
their economies. 
  With respect to the prospects for African economy in the new 
year, it does not allow much optimism because all the factors 
that have hindered the African economic performance in 1993 will 
remain a constraint to the growth. Besides, with the loss of 
some preferences conceded to Africa after the GATT Uruguay Round 
agreement was signed and with the reduction of aid and resources 
flowing to Africa from World Bank and other international 
institutes, Africa will face more crises. In face of the 
challenge, Africans have uttered stronger voice for 
self-reliance and intra- Africa cooperation in developing the 
continent's economy.

technology with 141 countries and international organizations 
including the World Bank, the United Nations Food and 
Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.

overseas in the period and, plus the number of foreign experts 
invited by provinces, the figure is estimated to be more than 
10,000. 
  The World Food Program helped 30 provinces, regions and 
municipalities in the country in setting up 55 grain production 
project worth more than 700 million U.S. dollars. 
  The World Bank also provided loans of 850 million U.S. 
dollars for China's 16 agricultural projects. 
  Statistics show that China now has more than 400 
agricultural 
projects which are funded by foreign loans totaling 2.6 billion 
U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev said today that his country wishes to 
develop a partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) on the basis of extensive political contacts 
and policy and action coordination. 
  Meeting with two visiting U.S. senators, Grachev said that 
in 
its security concept of partnership for peace, NATO should take 
into account the interests of all countries instead of its 
member states only, the INTERFAX News Agency reported. 
  Russia, which used to lead the Warsaw Pact nations against 
NATO during the Cold War, has become deeply concerned over the 
attempts of some of its former partners to join NATO. Russia 
insisted that NATO should first weaken its role as a 
political-military bloc. 
  To ease Russia's anxiety, the United States has said that it 
opposes NATO's immediate acceptance of any East European nation. 
  In his meeting with the U.S. senators, Grachev also said 
Russia has given up its former promise of not using nuclear 
weapons first because other nuclear powers have not done so.

  [Begin Li recording] Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin 
was commenting on the U.S. invitation to bilateral negotiations 
which would lead to a textile agreement. He was also asked 
whether China is concerned about the possible drop in the U.S. 
textile import quota. Wu Jianmin spoke through his interpreter: 
  The Chinese side is always in favor of settling the question 
of Chinese textiles imported to the United States through 
negotiations. We are now having a serious study on the 
invitation from the U.S. side. Officials from the two sides are 
now maintaining contacts with each other as regard to specific 
arrangements of the proposed visit. [passage omitted on Wu's

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation today said 
that If the U.S. side clings obstinately to its course [yi yi gu 
xing 0001 1942 1324 5887] on the bilateral trade of textile 
products, China will be compelled to take appropriate 
retaliatory measures. 
  The spokesmen today issued a statement to lodge a serious 
protest [yan zhong kang yi 0917 6850 2123 6231] against the 
United States' unilateral move to cut import quota of textiles 
from China. 
  The Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement on textile products 
expired 
on 31 December 1993. The two sides held three rounds of talks 
prior to the expiration date but could not reach an agreement. 
  The spokesman said: When the two sides are about to hold the 
fourth round of talks, the U.S. side unilaterally declared sharp 
cuts in import quota of textiles from China. "This is a very 
irresponsible move. It has not only aroused strong reaction 
[qiang lie fan ying 1730 3525 0646 2019] in China but also 
generated extensive dissatisfaction [guang fan bu man 1639 3131 
0008 3341] in the United States. It will seriously influence 
[yan zhong ying xiang 0917 6850 1758 0742] the economic and 
trade relations between China and the United States." 
  He said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation solemnly [zheng zhong 6774 6850] declares that the 
Chinese side will continue the talks according to the original 
plan and solve the problem through negotiations. If the U.S. 
side clings obstinately to its course, China will be compelled 
[po 6612] to take appropriate retaliatory measures[bao fu cuo 
shi 1032 1788 2238 2457].

  [Text] Tokyo, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Deputy Premier 
and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said here today that 
Sino-Japanese cooperation in the coming years should be 
future-oriented and conducive to world peace and prosperity. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Hata noted that 
friendly Sino-Japanese relations, which were normalized in 1972, 
have entered a new phase and should be broadened for the benefit 
of the international community. 
  Hata, who leaves for Beijing tomorrow on an official visit, 
reiterated Japan's support for China's reform and modernization 
drive. 
  "A long-term and sustainable economic development in China 
is 
of vital importance," he observed. "China's bid for a socialist 
market economy, if it succeeds, will have a significant bearing 
on the global economy, and on peace and stability in Asia and 
the world at large." 
  He discounted the threat of China's military buildup, saying 
China will not "go for big-military power status" despite its 
efforts toward arms modernization. 
  On the question of Tokyo-Taiwan ties, the foreign minister 
said that the Japanese Government has been committed to 
maintaining only non-official contact with Taiwan since 1972. 
  Although there are divergent views on the issue in his 
country, Hata noted that Japan's Taiwan policy is unchanged, and 
promised that it will remain so in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Chang Mu (1728 3092): "Deng Xiaoping Stresses </F>
Shanghai's Leading Role in National Development"] 
  [Text] Judging from the development of the international 
situation, China will face a rare, favorable opportunity for 
reform and development over a considerably long period of time. 
As asserted by some authoritative observers, China will 
continue to be in a process of rapid growth. There is massive 
potential in its domestic market, which has provided a vast 
field for industrial development. By and large, various 
countries in the world look favorably on the economic trend in 
China, so that the country will continue to be the world's 
largest market attracting foreign capital, both at present and 
for a considerable time to come. 
<H5>  Three Major Signs of Economic Direction </H5>
  Referring to opportunities, Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed 
out: The new year will be a momentous one in which China's 
economy will continue to maintain good development momentum. It 
also will be a crucial year in which the reform to establish a 
socialist market economy structure will be pushed forward. The 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has 
concretized and systematized the objectives and principles of 
this huge reform project, and has sketched out the basic 
framework of a Chinese-style market economy, which has become an 
overall tentative plan with a strong guiding and manipulative 
character, with a view to comprehensively pushing forward the 
omnidirectional reform for transforming government functions, 
optimizing macroeconomic regulation and control, revitalizing a 
microscopic economy, and expediting the building of a legal 
system. 
  The senior CPC leaders hold that reform and opening up 
over the past two years have been focused on Deng Xiaoping's 
remarks during his south China tour, the establishment of the 
socialist market economy structure defined at the 14th CPC 
National Congress, and the decision on the "50 measures" adopted 
at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee, all of 
which have organically formed the "three major signposts of 
China's economic direction" in this century, thus effecting a 
historic transition from a planned economy structure to a market 
economy structure. 
<H5>  Readjustment of Interests To Stabilize General Situation </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping said: Reform is also a revolution; it 
certainly will change the unreasonable patterns of interest 
inherent in the old structure or formed in the course of 
structural transformation, and inevitably will encounter certain 
difficulties or obstructions, including the readjustment of 
interests between the central and local governments, the 
preferential policies and investment restrictions among 
different industries, the income readjustment and changes among 
different social strata, and so on. 
  As reform will make a giant stride in the new year in which 
the number of reform measures to be introduced will be the 
greatest for the last 15 years, and will involve various areas 
-- including the state, enterprises, and individuals, as well as 
various trades and professions -- it will make up an organic 
body incorporating various major links of reform. Hence, it is 
necessary to push forward the reform in a positive, planned, 
comprehensive, and coordinated way in order to bring about an 
early formation of the new structure. Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the CPC, described this as "being of vital 
importance so that efforts should be made to strive for a sure 
victory." He also pointed out the necessity of handling 
the relationship among reform, development, and stability with 
particular caution. While persisting in taking the economic 
construction as a central task, it is necessary to persist in 
achieving economic development and social stability in a 
mutually complementary and unified way. He stressed that 
economic development is the last word [jing ji fa zhan shi ying 
dao li 4842 3444 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810]. Only by 
seizing the favorable opportunities can we deepen reform, open 
wider to the outside world, expedite development, and solidify 
the political situation of stability and unity. In turn, 
political stability in society will vigorously ensure the smooth 
advance of economic construction, reform, and opening up. He 
held that the maintenance of political stability is an 
appropriate compenent of the subject of concentrating our energy 
on economic construction, and these two aspects must supplement 
each other. He reminded members of the leading bodies to keep a 
sober mind and to be adept at discovering and at resolving in a 
timely fashion those new problems cropping up in the course of 
advance, and hose tendentious problems in particular. He 
stressed the necessity of carefully guiding and displaying the 
initiative of cadres and masses, paying attention to 
coordinating relations among various parties, and mobilizing all 
positive factors to create favorable conditions for the healthy 
development of the national economy. 
<H5>  Explorations Should Be Made To Avoid Great Ups and Downs </H5>
  Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up, China's 
economy has experienced several ups and downs, which have 
aroused attention in various quarters. Is this instability a 
transitional phenomenon of the structural transformation or is 
it a cyclical phenomenon of the market economy? The 
Development Research Center of the State Council, a major think 
tank in China, has listed it as one of the five major subjects 
for economic research in the 1990's. Sun Shangqing, 
director of the center, said: It was not sufficiently 
scientific to think in the past that there was no economic 
cyclicity under public ownership. The center has begun research 
on what special features the development cycles will have, and 
how we should base ourselves on these special features so as to 
reduce the extent of the fluctuations brought on by these cycles 
in the course of moving from a planned economy to a market 
economy, and even after the establishment of the market economy. 
It is hoped that the exploration into this law will help China 
avoid great ups and downs in its economy. 
  Along with the increasing impact of market prices on 
industrial and agricultural production, peasants have called for 
reducing various inappropriate burdens imposed by local 
governments, as they are the people most liable to be affected 
by the shifts in market supply and demand. When their income 
sags, they leave their villages and give up farming in order to 
engage in trade, a process that has led to the ever-increasing 
number of transients in the cities. Now and then, there are 
cases of "lodging petitions" by groups of peasants who have 
found it difficult to sell their products; who have been 
deceived by people selling forged pesticides, fertilizers, or 
seeds; or who have complaints about the high cost of farm 
implements. In this regard, the CPC has adopted a series of 
measures to increase agricultural investment, eliminate the 
phenomenon of "IOU notes" in the purchase of agricultural and 
sideline products, and so on. Xiao Yang, who took up the post 
of Sichuan provincial governor in 1993, claimed that the 
handling of peasants coming to town to "seek justice" was one of 
his principal jobs. 
<H5>  Workers' Position Remains Unchanged </H5>
  In the course of transforming enterprise operational 
mechanisms, owing to such public opinions as "now is an era of 
scientists and entrepreneurs," which emerged at one time, and to 
the fact that the rights and interests of staff and workers in 
foreign-invested enterprises very often were unprotected, 
workers felt that their position as "masters of the country" had 
declined. According to a survey of more than 300 
foreign-invested enterprises in Guangdong, most of the staff and 
workers put in 10 to 12 hours per day, with some working for 14 
hours or even as long as 28 hours in succession. In a 
considerable number of enterprises, labor protection was poor, 
with the air seriously polluted with poisonous gas and dust in 
excess of standards. Among the 400 staff and workers at a 
foreign- invested enterprise in Xiamen, Fujian, nearly one-tenth 
had a part or all of their fingers cut off owing to industrial 
accidents. In some localities, disputes between employers and 
employees arising from such phenomena as withholding employees' 
wages, beating or scolding them, sacking them at will, molesting 
women workers, and so on, were very serious in both domestically 
funded and foreign- invested enterprises. 
  A CPC leader pointed out: In the course of reform, 
opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economy 
structure, all aspects -- including the socialist system, the 
nature of the state, the status of the working class as a 
leading class, and the position of workers as masters of the 
country -- remain unchanged. The masters-of-the-country status 
of staff and workers in state-owned enterprises, as well as in 
foreign-invested, privately owned, and town and township 
enterprises, also remains unchanged. Jiang Zemin particularly 
pointed out: Trade union organizations should be set up in all 
foreign-invested enterprises so as to safeguard the legitimate 
rights and interests of the workers. 
<H5>  The Four Factors Determining the Success or Failure of Reform </H5>
  Recently, quite a few institutions of information on 
scientific research, as well as specialists, and academics, made 
assessments and analyses of China's situation of reform and 
openness, as well as its economic trends. Their relatively 
unanimous views are that China will continue to maintain a 
double-digit economic growth rate in the future on the grounds 
that -- given the somewhat intensified macroeconomic regulation 
and control -- development in the energy, communications, and 
essential raw and semifinished materials industries has been 
accelerated, the growth of real estate and tertiary industry has 
picked up again. They believe that the scope of investment will 
remain comparatively large, which will contribute to the 
development of economic production in various fields. In the 
industrial structural readjustment, certainly, the excessively 
high rate will decline to a certain extent. 
  One important point is: Whether or not the good momentum in 
changing tracks will be maintained in the new year under 
circumstances of the extensive introduction and implementation 
of various reform plans will depend on the following four 
factors: 
  1. Efforts are made to avoid great ups and downs in 
economic construction. These include stabilizing 
agriculture, reducing the impact of price reform on the economic 
sphere, guarding against fresh inflation brought about by 
relaxed investment, and so on. Jiang Zemin pointed out: 
There should be new ideas for economic development. It is 
necessary to really shift to the path of taking the enhancement 
of economic results as a central task, and to refrain from 
continuously following the beaten track of extensive operation 
characterized by blind pursuit of output value and expansion of 
investment scope. Serious attention should be paid to 
structural readjustment, technological transformation, the 
development of products, scientific and technological work, and 
management in these areas. In short, stress should be placed on 
the quantity, as well as the quality, of economic growth. 
  2. Stability is maintained in social and political 
life, and efforts are made to improve the condition of social 
security. Owing to uneven regional economic development, 
the income gaps between various social strata will be further 
widened in the reform years. In some minority regions, in 
particular, and in areas where public order has worsened or the 
economy has lagged behind, conflicts between cadres and the 
masses, among nationalities, and among religious factions, as 
well as the improper handling of certain problems by the 
government, may bring about some sudden events or incidents that 
will lead to serious consequences. As far as the general 
situation is concerned, thanks to the popular support given to 
the reform line for the market economy, the CPC has solidified 
its ruling position and confidence, so that the senior policy 
makers all think it impossible for a large, overall disturbance 
to break out. Some of the serious problems at present are poor 
public order -- with the number of serious cases remaining high 
-- and the ugly phenomena still existing in society. The CPC 
has taken firm control of improving the case-handling system on 
one hand, and is intensifying the police forces and adopting 
measures for the comprehensive management of social security on 
the other, so as to severely crack down on various kinds of 
criminal activities. Ideologically, it has further intensified 
its leadership over ideological, cultural, and propaganda work 
in a bid to prevent the outbreak of new turbulence and the 
emergence of destabilizing factors. 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Will Be Strengthened </H5>
  3. The authority of the central government is in 
place, and a coordinated relationship between the central and 
local authorities is being maintained, while macroeconomic 
regulation and control are being intensified and improved. 
When the CPC hierarchy put into effect various reform measures 
at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
in November, and at the national economic work meeting in 
December, it emphatically pointed out, time and again, that as 
the economy developed at a faster pace, there always would 
emerge some unbalanced phenomena in various areas. Hence, it was 
necessary to intensify macroeconomic regulation and control and 
to make readjustments in good time. Both Jiang Zemin and Li 
Peng repeatedly affirmed the achievements scored by the 
regulation and control measures adopted in the second half of 
1993. In their opinion, the correct practice of macroeconomic 
regulation and control has been an indispensable condition for 
the rapid growth, so economic, legal, and necessary 
administrative means should be applied still more properly to 
ensure healthy economic development in the future. As the CPC 
has intended to establish a market economic mechanism for fair 
competition, it is certain that the previous preferential 
policies will fade out deliberately. By using the means of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the CPC will be able to 
check various acts taken by various departments and localities 
to "jump the gun" [tou bu 0262 2975] in disregard of the overall 
interests. A more important point is that the intensification 
of macroeconomic regulation and control is conducive not only to 
making an overall arrangement, and to maintaining the unity of 
the state and the authority of the central administrative 
orders, but also to pushing forward the reform plan as a whole. 
<H5>  Measures Will Be Taken To Guard Against "Leftist" Deviation </H5>
  4. The resurgence of "leftist" deviation should be 
prevented, and the set policies of reform and opening up should 
be guaranteed so that they will not be changed after Deng 
Xiaoping's death. Since the 14th party congress, the CPC 
has put into practice measures to guarantee for 100 years the 
steadfast adherence to Deng's line, precisely through the 
party's political line, organizational line, and policymaking 
structure. In the activities to mark the centenary of Mao 
Zedong's birth, the CPC also took pains to lead the masses onto 
the track of studying Deng Xiaoping's theory and of pushing 
forward reform and opening up. 
  At present, owing to the great intensity and extensive range 
of the reform, the CPC has not lowered its vigilance against the 
possible risks that may occur. Recently, the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce promulgated new 
regulations on collecting consumption taxes, which triggered a 
new round of price rises in some areas. Spurred on by various 
rumors spreading among the masses, ordinary people demonstrated 
a "panic buying" mentality. The CPC authorities immediately 
called on all localities to take measures to stabilize the 
public will. On the one hand, the Beijing authorities 
repeatedly announced through the media that no plan to raise 
prices would be introduced in the near future. On the other 
hand, they called on relevant departments to adopt measures to 
limit the prices of retail goods so as to maintain order in the 
markets. 
<H5>  The Development of Shanghai Is a Microcosm </H5>
  There is an element essential to the success or failure of 
reform as a whole: Whether or not the openness and development 
in Shanghai will make major headway. 
  Deng Xiaoping maintained: "It is a momentous measure 
to take hold of Shanghai. Shanghai is our trump card, and it is 
a short cut to boost the economy in Shanghai.... In the past, 
Shanghai was a financial center, a place where money was freely 
convertible. In the future, we should make it like this again. 
If China wishes to gain an international position in the 
financial arena, we must rely on Shanghai in the first 
place." 
  It can be stated that after two or three years of 
large-scale 
development and construction, Shanghai has become a dragon head 
of reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang valley, and even in 
the entire country. The most important measures for the forward 
position of reform have been experimented here, and the 
development of Pudong has made headway, with a substantial 
influx of various types of foreign funds. Shanghai's reforms in 
foreign exchange, the securities market, the futures market, and 
banking have begun to take shape. Deng Xiaoping 
particularly stressed: "The banking industry is very important, 
as it is the core of the modern economy. If financial work -- 
like a pawn in a chess game -- is well played and invigorated, 
the whole game will be invigorated." Today, there are 
scores of foreign-invested and joint-venture banks and finance 
companies in Shanghai, and there are Chinese-funded banks too. 
Shanghai has taken a crucial step to revive the old dream of an 
oriental financial center. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990's, a total of 12 bonded 
zones 
have been set up in China's coastal areas. These are Dalian, 
Tianjin, Qingdao, Zhangjiagang, Waigaoqiao, Ningbo, Fuzhou, 
Xiamen, Guangzhou, Futian and Shatoujiao in Shenzhen, and 
Haikou. Among them, the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in Pudong, 
Shanghai, set up earliest of all and entirely closed, was the 
largest, covering an area of 10 square km. One after another, a 
great many world-class companies have opened offices here. Of 
the 500 enterprises that have commenced business here, 446 are 
foreign-invested enterprises. A number of experts hold that the 
bonded zones in Shanghai's Waigaoqiao and Xiamen's Xiangyu boast 
many conditions favorable to the construction of free ports, 
which will serve as excellent channels for converging with the 
international market once China reenters GATT. 
  Moreover, economist Ju Chongwei proposed that in a bid to 
build Shanghai into an international financial and trade center, 
it is necessary to follow the model of Hong Kong in exporting 
capital, technology, management, and service, and to construct 
the Chang Jiang valley and southern area of China into a fifth 
"little dragon." He viewed with disfavor the practices of 
absorbing purely foreign capital so as to make only Pudong 
prosperous, and of developing purely local industries, as such 
practices cannot turn Shanghai into a modern cosmopolis. 
  It is certain that the economic development and the 
establishment of a new structure in Shanghai will become a 
microcosm of the development trend of reform and opening up in 
China.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0805 GMT on 22 December broadcasts the 
11th in a series of 13 lectures on "Deng Xiaoping's Theory of 
Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics." An editorial 
report describing the content of the 10th lecture in the series 
was published in the Political &amp; Social section of the 23 
December Chian DAILY REPORT, page 18. 
  The 11th lecture, which lasts for 25 minutes, is entitled: 
"The Four Cardinal Principles Are a Political Guarantee for 
Modernization Construction, Reform, and Opening Up," and is 
given by Professor Cai Changshui (5591 7022 3055), executive 
deputy head of the Theoretical Department of the Central Party 
School. 
  Cai begins the lecture by explaining the need to adhere to 
the four cardinal principles -- namely, the socialist road, the 
people's democratic dictatorship, leadership of the Communist 
Party, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Then, he goes 
on to elaborate the vital bearing of these principles on the 
unification of the nation, the prosperity of the country, and 
the victory of socialism in China. He stresses these 
principles, which were put forward by Deng after the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and which form 
the main component of the party's basic line, as the cornerstone 
of the nation and the prerequisite for building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Discussing the great importance of these principles for the 
smooth progress of China's reform and opening up, Cai maintains: 
All reform and opening up policies are formed on the basis of 
these principles, which are the major criteria for judging 
whether a policy measure is correct or not. These principles, 
which guarantee the socialist orientation of all reform and 
opening up measures, must be formulated and implemented under 
the guidance of Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
under the leadership of the Communist Party. Moreover, the 
implementation of principles and policies must be guaranteed by 
the powerful weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship. 
  Emphasizing the connotation of these principles in the new 
era of establishing a socialist market economic structure, Cai 
explains how these principles can guide the emancipation and 
development of productive forces, in the implementation of a 
diversified ownership system with public ownership as the 
mainstay and new distribution system of allowing some people to 
become well off before common prosperity is achieved; in the 
construction of the legal system and institution of multi-party 
consultation system led by the CPC; in the strengthening and 
improvement of the CPC's leadership; and in the analysis and 
solution of new problems by integrating Marxism- Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought with realities in China. The lecture ends at 
0830 GMT.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0805 GMT on 29 December broadcasts the 
12th in a series of 13 lectures on "Deng Xiaoping's Theory of 
Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics." 
  The 12th lecture, entitled: "Strategic Steps for China's 
Socialist Modernization Construction," is given by Wang Mengkui, 
deputy director of the State Council Research Office. 
  Wang's lecture begins with a brief explanation of the 
three-step strategy for China's modernization drive, which 
constitutes an important component of Deng's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to Wang, this 
strategy aims, as the first step, to double the 1980 Gross 
National Product (GNP] to provide the people with enough to eat 
and wear; second, to quadruple the GNP before the end of this 
century to enable the people to lead a comparatively well-off 
life; and finally, to basically accomplish the modernization 
drive by the mid-21st century. 
  Then, Wang reviews how this strategy, adopted and 
implemented 
since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, has effectively guided the Chinese economy, enabling 
it to grow at an annual rate of 9 percent throughout the 
eighties. After citing statistics showing fruitful achievements 
in various economic sectors, he stresses that as China continues 
to face great opportunities in the nineties, it is necessary to 
continue to exert every muscle to push the economy forward. 
Turning to the ongoing economic structural reform, he notes 
that the smooth progress in lifting price control and 
instituting a new distribution system has enhanced the role of 
market and promoted the development of diverse economic sectors. 
  Discussing the tasks of economic development, Wang points 
out: Last year's 12.8 percent growth rate was higher than the 
originally planned 6 percent. In view of the constraints of raw 
materials, energy, and transportation, it will be rather 
difficult to keep up with last year's growth rate. In 
developing the economy from now on, it is necessary to 
concentrate efforts on efficiency, not speed. Efforts should be 
made to optimize structure and extensively apply advanced 
science and technology in agricultural and industrial 
production. The lecture ends at 0830 GMT.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Council Premier Li Peng by </F>
corrrespondent Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) at Zhongnanhai; 
date not given: "An Interview with Li Peng on Reform and 
Opening up in 1994"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- On the eve of the end of 
the old year and the beginning of the new, Premier Li Peng 
granted this XINHUA correspondent an interview at Zhongnanhai in 
which he looked ahead at the overall trend of reform and opening 
up in 1994 and expressed full confidence in China's political 
and economic development and its foreign relations. 
<H5>  The Four Characteristics of 1993's Economic Development </H5>
  [Zhou] How would you characterize China's economic 
development in 1993? 
  [Li] It can be summed up in four main characteristics: 
  1. It continued its relatively rapid development rate. GNP 
grew by 13 percent, something not often seen amid the present 
world economic depression [xiao tiao 4682 2742]. 
  2. As for reforms, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee erected the basic framework for the 
construction of a socialist market economy system, thereby 
providing the reform with a more specific target. 
  3. Opening to the outside world moved ahead on an 
unprecedented scale and the utilization of foreign capital rose 
to another peak. Direct investment by foreign businessmen topped 
$20 billion, indicating a general optimism about the prospects 
for the Chinese market. 
  4. There were some conspicuous contradictions and problems 
in the process of development, but the party Central Committee 
and State Council eased these contradictions and laid a 
foundation for the healthy development of the national economy 
by adopting the method of boosting macroregulation and control. 
<H5>  Reforms Will Take Major Steps in 1994 </H5>
  [Zhou] What will be the overall trend in China's economic 
development in 1994? 
  [Li] The trend can be characterized in two phrases: 1) 
Reform will take major steps; and 2) sustained, rapid, and 
healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] 
economic development. 
  So-called "major steps" carry specific references. These 
major steps will be reflected primarily in a modern corporate 
system and in reforms in the financial, tax, monetary, 
investment, and foreign trade systems -- all of them oriented 
toward building a socialist market economic system. 
  The initial proposal from the State Council was a nine 
economic growth rate for 1994, a little lower than last year, 
because two consecutive years of high-speed economic growth will 
have strained various sectors in the national economy, and the 
"bottlenecks" -- such as we have in the transport and energy 
sectors -- will have become more severe. In order to sustain 
economic development, we need to maintain a more relaxed 
environment [song kuan 2646 1401]. Compared with countries 
around the world, a nine percent growth rate is still quite 
fast. "Healthy" [jian kang 0256 1660] can be understood in many 
different ways, but right now it means primarily structural 
improvement and raising economic efficiency. 
<H5>  Be Active and Cautious in Price Reforms </H5>
  [Zhou] What moves are in store for price reforms in 1994, 
and 
how will they affect reforms in other areas? 
  [Li] This year's price reforms will go hand-in-hand with 
several other reforms. The overall objective is to bring the 
price system closer to market laws. In the last decade or so, 
China has taken very great steps in price reforms and has 
acquired rich experience. Most price adjustments have achieved 
the desired results: Except for a few commodities vital to the 
national economy and people's livelihood, prices for 90 percent 
of all commodities are now market-regulated. Most of the 
remaining commodities are in infrastructural industry, the 
prices of which tend to be low to encourage their consumption, 
thus hindering the development of these industries. Adjustments 
are in order, but are also more difficult; for example, the 
petroleum industry will never be able to develop without 
adjustment, but any adjustment in petroleum prices inevitably 
affects its products. So we need to adopt a very cautious and 
gradual approach. 
  As markets in our country have yet to mature, markets are 
suffering from their inherent spontaneity and blindness. 
Therefore, at a suitable time there should be state 
macroregulation and control to make sure that the people's 
interests are protected. 
  In each of the significant reformist measures, we have taken 
the endurance of the country, of enterprises, and of the people 
into full consideration, and so we are upholding an orderly and 
gradual approach. Too great a step inevitably will affect 
company costs and people's livelihood. 
<H5>  Lessons From the Grain Market Fluctuations </H5>
  Earlier, grain prices fluctuated in some regions. The causes 
were many. As the state had enough grain on hand and as state 
grain sales departments functioned as the main channels, the 
fluctuations leveled off gradually. 
  The grain market fluctuations should be viewed in this way: 
On the one hand, sufficient grain reserves displayed the 
state's macroregulatory and control power; on the other hand, 
there is a lesson to be learned here, which is that in no way 
can we grow complacent about, or can governments at any level 
relinquish control over the problem of price, even at the best 
of economic times. 
<H3>  Reforms in the Monetary, Investment, Foreign Exchange, and 
Foreign Trade Systems Reinforce Each Other </H3>
  [Zhou] What are the connections between reforms in the 
monetary and investment systems and those in the foreign 
exchange and foreign trade systems? 
  [Li] Reforms in the monetary system will set in motion 
reforms in the investment system. In the practice of the market 
economy, this means that investment will be regulated and 
controlled by the money market: The volume of investment 
depends entirely on amounts of money. Meanwhile, industrial 
policy will determine the direction of investment. 
  Adopting a unified exchange rate and a unitary, managed 
floating exchange rate system based on market demand and supply 
aids the effort to open up to the outside world, will promote 
further growth in foreign economic cooperation and trade, and 
will have a positive impact on China's efforts to integrate its 
economy with the world economy. 
<H3>  Financial and Tax Reforms Are in the Interests of Various 
Circles </H3>
  [Zhou] Can financial and tax reforms be implemented 
smoothly, 
in light of the fact that they may affect the local interests of 
some regions and enterprises? 
  [Li] Financial and tax reforms consist mainly of unifying 
tax 
laws, a fair tax burden, and changing the contract system into a 
tax-revenue sharing system. In all, enterprises do not have a 
larger tax burden. The reform is an adjustment in the interest 
pattern. 
  The key to the financial and tax reforms is a reasonable 
taxation system compatible with the demands of a socialist 
market economy system, and at the same time, in line with 
international convention. The tax-revenue sharing system is 
generally adopted in countries with a market economy. It 
strengthens the state's financial macroregulatory and control 
powers. However, most of the additional income for the central 
government will be plowed back into the local authorities in 
various forms. To take the endurance of localities and 
enterprises into account, and to ensure the convergence of the 
old tax system with the new, we will arrange for a transitional 
period, during which the present interest pattern will remain as 
it is. Only gradually will the central financial authorities 
raise their proportion of revenues from the later-increased part 
of taxes. 
<H5>  The Market Economy Will Be a Unified Market </H5>
  [Zhou] How do you see some of the potential differences in 
view between the central and local authorities and between the 
localities themselves, and the problem of imbalanced economic 
development? 
  [Li] China is a unified country, and the socialist market 
economy system we are going to develop will be a unified market. 
Of course, there are bound to be differences in view between 
China [as published] and localities, and development in 
different regions is indeed not balanced. 
  The gap between the eastern and western regions has indeed 
widened, but the western region is developing too. People's 
living standards there are continuously rising. When we look 
around the world, we can see that imbalanced development is a 
universal law; all countries are subject to it. Moreover, the 
party and the government have taken full notice of the gap 
between the eastern and western regions, and are adopting 
measures to solve it. 
  If the concern over the imbalanced development between 
regions in China and the contradictions between local interests 
triggered off by reforms are good-intentioned, we can understand 
these kinds of concerns. If, however, there are people with 
hostile intentions or hopes, who even assert that the imbalanced 
development between the eastern and western parts inevitably 
will "divide" China, banking on the appearance of internal 
problems in China, then their wishes will never come true. 
<H3>  Theoretical Foundations and Organizational Guarantee for 
Modernization </H3>
  [Zhou] In 1993, the world began to look at China with new 
eyes. What do you think are the main reasons for this? 
  [Li] The fundamental reason was the enormous progress in 
China's reform and opening up, and its economic construction 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  A few years ago, amid the violent changes in Eastern Europe 
and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, someone in the world 
was spreading the theory of "China toppling." Facts have shown 
that China not only has not toppled, but has grown stronger. 
Now many economists, commentators, and even politicians around 
the world are making far more optimistic estimates and 
predictions than our own regarding China's economic power and 
prospects. Despite their incongruence from the real situation, 
in a way they reflect the world's recognition of China's 
achievements. 
  Now, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's whole set of theories about 
socialism with Chinese characteristics has taken full shape and 
has demonstrated its enormous power in practice. Meanwhile, the 
third- generation collective leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the 
core, has been formed and is maturing. Thus, our modernization 
effort is not only blessed with a theoretical foundation, but 
with also an organizational guarantee. Today, we are more 
confident than ever in China's future. 
  It should be pointed out, however, that once again there 
are ill-intentioned people in the world spreading the theory of 
the "China threat" in an attempt to sow discord between China 
and its neighbors and to undermine the good relations between 
China and the surrounding countries. From "China toppling" to 
the "China threat" is a complete U-turn, and as such is 
mystifying. Both these extremes reflect ignorance of the 
realities of China. A strong and developing China will pose no 
threat to any country; it will only contribute more to world 
peace and development. 
<H5>  China's Foreign Relations Will Further Expand in 1994 </H5>
  [Zhou] How will China develop its diplomacy in the present 
international situation? 
  [Li] With the coming of 1994, the world enters the third 
year 
since the Cold War. Generally speaking, there is an aspect in 
the international situation which is easing up, and the world is 
developing in the direction of multipolarization. On the other 
hand, there are still many destabilizing factors in the world. 
The two major themes -- peace and development -- have yet to be 
resolved. 
  In the turbulent and unstable world, Asia -- and especially 
East Asia -- has maintained relative stability and sustained 
economic development. This is one important feature in the 
current international situation. It can be foreseen that in the 
new year East Asia will further strengthen its status and 
influence in the world. 
  It also can be foreseen that China's international status 
will rise further, its foreign relations further expanding. 
Specifically, China's overall relations with European countries 
are expected to see notable improvements. The meeting between 
the Chinese and U.S. heads of state supplied a good opportunity. 
It is possible to achieve new development in Sino-U.S. 
relations. Facts have proved that there are wide-ranging common 
interests between China and the Western countries, which are the 
foundation for developing ties between them. 
<H5>  Common Efforts at Peacefully Unifying the Motherland </H5>
  [Zhou] What are your New Year expectations for Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and for overseas Chinese? 
  [Li] With the coming of 1994, the dates when Hong Kong and 
Macao return to the motherland draw even closer. Whatever 
happens, we will have the ability to restore sovereignty over 
Hong Kong as scheduled, to uphold the principle of "one country, 
two systems" and the Basic Law, and to maintain Hong Kong's 
long-term prosperity and stability. The economies of Hong Kong 
and Macao now are linked closely with that of the mainland. As 
the mainland economy develops, the economies of Hong Kong and 
Macao will grow increasingly prosperous. 
  Peaceful unification is the direction of the general trend 
and is what people desire. Attempts at "two Chinas," one China, 
one Taiwan" or "one country, two governments" run counter the 
historical trend and go against the common wish and fundamental 
interest of the Chinese people on both sides of the strait. We 
hope the Taiwan authorities will place the great national cause 
above all else and will do more practical things for the 
reunification and prosperity of the motherland. 
  I believe all the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots 
and all the overseas Chinese are descendants of the Chinese 
race. A strong Chinese nation is our common wish. In the new 
year we all should continue to work for this.

Central Leading Group for Party History Work: "Mao Zedong Was 
an Unswerving Explorer of Truth"; editor's note at the end of 
the item states: "This is the speech made by Comrade Bo Yibo at 
the `Seminar on Mao Zedong's Life and Thought'; the headline was 
provided by the editor"] 
  [Text] The CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department and 
four other units are jointly holding a "Seminar on Mao Zedong's 
Life and Thought" as the whole party, the whole Army, and the 
people of all nationalities across the land are marking the 
centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. This is a major event 
for ideological and theoretical circles and is also an important 
component of the nationwide memorial activities. As a veteran 
party member and a veteran fighter who worked for a long time 
under Chairman Mao's leadership, I sincerely hope the seminar 
will be lively, serious, practical, and of a high level and 
yield valuable results so as to push forward the study of Mao 
Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Comrades who sponsored the seminar hoped I would express my 
views on ways to commemorate Chairman Mao in connection with my 
book A Review of a Number of Major Policy Decisions and 
Events. In my view, at a time when our reform, opening up 
to the outside world, and modernization drive has entered a new 
stage and when Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping has just come out, the most important thing for 
the ideological and theoretical circles to do in marking the 
centenary of Chairman Mao's birth is to follow Chairman Mao's 
example by integrating the fundamental tenets of 
Marxism-Leninism with China's realities and by upholding the 
principle of proceeding in all cases from China's actual 
conditions so as to promote in an all-round way the study and 
propaganda of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, speed up reform, open 
China wider to the outside world, and stimulate a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. 
  Great leader Chairman Mao was an steadfast explorer of 
truth. 
In the late 1920's and early 1930's, when Marxism was regarded 
as a dogma and the Communist International's resolutions and the 
Soviet Union's experience were considered sacred and inviolable 
by those engaged in the international communist movement and by 
many comrades in our party, a group of Chinese communists 
represented by Chairman Mao independently pondered over the 
problems concerning the Chinese revolution in the scientific 
spirit of seeking truth from facts, braving all difficulties. 
Through long-term efforts, they gradually integrated the 
fundamental tenets of Marxism with China's realities and 
developed a strategy of encircling the cities from the rural 
areas and finally capturing the whole country. They formulated 
a complete set of theories, lines, principles, and policies for 
the new-democratic revolution, as well as the strategies and 
tactics for the people's war, which complied with China's actual 
conditions. It was by arming itself with these theories, lines, 
strategies, and tactics that our party was able to lead the 
people of the whole country in winning the great victory in the 
new-democratic revolution. 
  In the process of putting the economy back on its feet and 
of 
turning China from a new-democratic country into a socialist 
country after the founding of New China, we copied the Soviet 
Union in its set-ups, systems, and economic strategies because 
we lacked experience, because the Soviet Union was the only 
socialist country at that time and enjoyed high prestige in the 
world, and in particular because we began the first five-year 
plan for the economic development with the great support of the 
Soviet Union. Nevertheless, our party still managed to make 
innovations of its own. As far as I can remember, our party 
made following innovations in the socialist transformation and 
other fields in the early days of New China. 
  1. The party carried out socialist transformation and 
socialist industrialization simultaneously, which was different 
from the Soviet Union's strategy of putting state 
industrialization before the collectivization of agriculture. 
  2. The party transformed agriculture, handicraft, and the 
capitalist industry and commerce step by step, going from low 
levels to high levels, thus only causing a comparatively small 
shock in society, while the Soviet Union took over capitalists' 
factories and carried out collectivization in one step. 
  3. Adopting a peaceful buying-out policy toward national 
capitalists' means of production and subjecting the capitalists 
to education and transformation, treating them as our treasure 
instead of sending them packing, so that they would become 
self-supporting workers, which was different than the Soviet 
Union's practice. 
  4. From the very beginning the party made Chairman Mao's 
"all directions" policy its fundamental principle for economic 
development, which called for taking public and private 
interests into account, benefiting both labor and capital, 
mutual assistance between town and country, and exchange of 
goods between town and country. The party followed the law of 
value in handling its economic relations with peasants, which 
found expression, for example, in the policy of unified purchase 
and marketing of farm produce by the state in early days of New 
China. All these were entirely different from the Soviet 
Union's "system under which the peasants were committed to 
deliver and sell farm produce to the state" and its policy of 
exacting a large amount of money from the peasants to set up the 
accumulation fund. 
  5. In the early days of New China, while giving top 
priority to heavy industry in developing the economy (which was 
necessary at that time), the party did not neglect the 
development of light industry and agriculture. Chairman Mao 
frequently told us at that time: "Never neglect light industry 
while giving priority to heavy industry." As a result, while 
our heavy industry grew rapidly, our light industry and 
agriculture also made progress. This was different from the 
policy of the Soviet Union and of other Eastern European 
countries of "walking on one leg." 
  6. With regard to the political system, we upheld the system 
of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the communist party while the Soviet Union 
introduced the one-party system. 
  7. "To settle the problem concerning ethnic minorities, the 
party introduced the system of regional national autonomy rather 
than setting up a federal republic. We believe this is a good 
system, because it complies with China's actual conditions." 
(see page 257 of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. Only the page number will be given when the book 
is quoted hereafter.) This system has played an important part 
in strengthening the unity of various nationalities over the 
last 40 years and more following the founding of New China. 
  8. The Chinese Government, together with the Indian 
Government, first put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Coexistence -- mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's 
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful 
coexistence -- as the guidance for handling state-to-state 
relations. This principle has been widely accepted in the world. 
  The above shows that the party Central Committee headed by 
Chairman Mao successfully solved the problems concerning the 
setting up of a socialist system in China by creating original 
principles for carrying out socialist transformation, which were 
suited to China's actual conditions. Some of the original 
principles were designed for the stage of the new-democratic 
revolution, but they still hold good for the stage of socialist 
construction. 
  Our comrades must remember that in early 1950's the 
organization responsible for the international communist 
movement actually preached two "whatevers": Whatever Stalin 
said brooks no skepticism; whatever experience the Soviet Union 
created must be copied indiscriminately. Our party did not 
follow their advice in every respect. Later we even clearly 
told leaders of the CPSU (the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union) that we do not agree with some of the things they have 
done and with some of their practices." (see Chairman Mao's 
Speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central 
Committee) This distinctly displayed the spirit of maintaining 
independence and the originality of the party Central Committee 
headed by Chairman Mao. If we had copied the Soviet Union's 
experience indiscriminately from the founding of New China, 
China's socialist transformation would not have proceeded so 
smoothly. 
  At this point, I would also like to speak about my 
reflection 
on Chairman Mao's instructions on the focal point of work. At 
the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, 
which was held immediately before the founding of New China, 
Chairman Mao said: "From the first day we take over the city, 
we must keep a close watch on the restoration and development of 
the city's production. We must not act rashly so that we will 
not forget the central task." All other work in the city "must 
be subject to and serve the central task of production and 
construction." On 1 June 1949 he clearly pointed out: "From 
now on, emphasis must be placed on development. Friends in all 
quarters are expected to join forces. In September 1954, in his 
government work report, Premier Zhou set the goal of achieving 
modernizations of industry, agriculture, communications and 
transportation, and defense. This is the first expression of 
the four modernizations. On 31 March 1955 when making a 
concluding speech at the national party congress, Chairman Mao 
said: We have entered a new historical period when we will 
apply ourselves to socialist industrialization, socialist 
transformation, modernization of defense, and studying atomic 
energy. He gave a speech at the Supreme State Conference on 25 
January 1956, clearly pointing out: "The socialist revolution 
is aimed at liberating productive forces." This clearly 
indicated that while focusing on socialist transformation, 
Chairman Mao never forgot the central task of economic 
development and worked for a shift to this central task at an 
early date. 
  In our party, Chairman Mao was the first person to discover 
the drawbacks of the Soviet Union's set-ups and economic 
strategy. After the death of Stalin, the Soviet Union's 
deep-seated problems were exposed in turn. This made Chairman 
Mao realize that the Soviet Union's experience was not flawless 
and perfect. Hence, in late 1955, immediately before the 20th 
CPSU National Congress, he talked about his idea of "taking 
warning from the Soviet Union" at a meeting attended by only a 
small number of members of the central leading body. Guided by 
this idea, he took more than two months to listen to reports 
made by 30 ministries and commissions and then set about 
evaluating our own experience so as to blaze a new path to 
socialism, a path which suited China's actual conditions. His 
speech entitled "10 Major Relations," which was his distillation 
of combined wisdom of the entire party, advanced a basic 
principle of bringing into play every positive factor at home 
and abroad to serve the cause of socialism. This was of 
far-reaching significance and served as a guide for a long time. 
I personally witnessed Chairman Mao's strenuous efforts to 
explore truth in this period. I profited greatly from his 
spirit and all sorts of feelings welled up in my heart. I will 
not say more about this because a special chapter of my book "A 
Review of a Number of Major Policy Decisions and Events" has 
been devoted to the matter. Here, I would only like to 
summarize the important viewpoints Chairman Mao raised or 
approved in the one-year period from the time he made the speech 
to the summer of 1957 and to discuss in brief the significance 
of these viewpoints. 
  To my knowledge, the important viewpoints raised in this 
period can be summed up in the following 14 points. 
  1. The theory of two types of contradictions. This theory 
played an important part in deciding on the main subject of the 
political life of the country and party, in creating political 
unity and stability, and in focusing on socialist construction. 
  2. The theory concerning the shift of the principal 
contradiction and of the focal point of work. Since the 
"Decision about the Political Report" adopted by the Eighth CPC 
National Congress had confirmed that the contradiction between 
the material and cultural demands of the people and the failure 
to meet these demands had constituted the primary contradiction 
of the society rather than the contradiction between the 
proletariat and the capitalist class, it was undoubtedly logical 
that the focal point of work was shifted to socialist 
construction. 
  3. The theory of fundamental contradictions in a socialist 
society. This theory confirmed that fundamental contradictions 
in a socialist society remain the contradiction between the 
relations of production and productive forces and that between 
the superstructure and the economic basis and that the 
contradictions are no longer antagonistic in nature as they were 
in the old society. This indicated: The contradiction in a 
socialist society can be solved through self-regulation. The 
constant development and constant solution of the two 
contradictions provide driving force for the development of the 
socialist society. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "More than 20 
years of practice reveals that such a formulation is better than 
others." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 1975-82, 
page 168) This theory can still serve as a guide for our 
present reform. 
  The above three points constituted a whole set of theories 
concerning the contradictions in a socialist society. They were 
the scientific results Chairman Mao obtained by applying the law 
of the unity of opposites to observing the socialist society. 
They also made a major breakthrough of the traditional idea 
that only moral identity but no contradictions exist in a 
socialist society, representing an important development of 
Marxism. 
  4. The idea of giving play to the initiative of the central 
government and of localities. This meant that central 
government must delegate a part of its power over state affairs 
to local governments. Chairman Mao formulated this idea by 
integrating China's experience in national development and 
Western countries' experience in developing the economy. 
  5. While making it a rule that state-owned enterprises must 
be run by the state, allow enterprises to enjoy a certain degree 
of autonomy, and while stipulating that the state market must 
play a dominant role, allow free markets to serve as supplements 
to state- controlled markets in certain areas. 
  6. Allow individual economy to serve as a supplement to the 
public and collective sectors, "allow capitalism to be 
reinstated after being eliminated"; give underground factories a 
legal status and allow them to hire workers; and stipulate that 
overseas Chinese- funded factories will not be taken over for 20 
or even 100 years. This represented a breakthrough in the 
traditional concept that regarded public ownership as the only 
ownership in a socialist society. 
  7. The principle of taking into account the interests of the 
state, the collective, and the individual in interest 
distribution. This was a principle based on the Soviet Union's 
lesson. 
  8. The economic strategy of developing industry and 
agriculture simultaneously and of developing of heavy and light 
industries simultaneously, which is a strategy of achieving 
industrialization the Chinese way. 
  9. The call for "marching toward the modernization of 
science," for "catching up with the advanced world scientific 
level," and for building up a mighty contingent of technicians 
of the working class. 
  10. The policy of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a 
hundred schools of thought contend. This reflects the objective 
law governing the development of science and arts. This policy 
was different from the Soviet Union's policy favoring only the 
opinions of a certain theoretician and a certain school of art 
to the exclusion of others. 
  11. The principle of long-term coexistence and mutual 
supervision. This principle was the product of Chinese history, 
adding new content to the system of multiparty cooperation under 
the CPC leadership, a system formed under China's historical 
conditions. 
  12. The goal of strengthening democracy and the legal 
system. The goal is "to create a political situation in which 
there are both centralism and democracy, both discipline and 
freedom, both unity of will and personal ease of mind and 
liveliness" so as to facilitate socialist construction and to 
put the country in a better position against risks. 
  13. The idea of "all patriots belonging to one big family, 
whether they rally to the common cause early or late" and the 
proposal to liberate Taiwan in a peaceful way. These were 
announced by Premier Zhou in his report to the third session of 
the first NPC in June 1956. 
  14. The strategy of "uniting all the international forces 
that can be united, persuade the forces that have a bias to 
observe neutrality, and split up and utilize the reactionary 
forces." 
  Most of the above viewpoints were not put into effect and 
some of them were still under deliberations, but they showed 
that Chairman Mao did try to shake off the yoke of the Soviet 
Union's ossified formula and of Stalin's "leftist" ideological 
guidance in search of a system which is flexible and an 
ideological guidance which suits China's actual conditions. 
  Regrettably, after the second half of 1957, Chairman Mao 
overestimated the gravity of the class struggle at home and 
abroad and developed arrogance and conceit and was overanxious 
for quick results because of a series of major successes. As a 
result, he provided "leftist" ideological guidance for China's 
economic and social development as well as for the state and the 
party's political activities, which led to "leftist" failings in 
the following 20 years. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Comrade Mao 
Zedong's mistakes lay in going against the correct principles he 
had upheld." (p 262) According my understanding, "the correct 
principles" refer, among other things, to the ideological line 
of seeking truth from facts, which Chairman Mao upheld for a 
long time, and the correct viewpoints he raised in the process 
of his exploration. 
  Nevertheless, Chairman Mao, after all, was a great 
explorer. After 1957, especially in early 1960's when the 
mistakes resulting from the Great Leap Forward and from "setting 
up the people's commune" were being corrected, he still put 
forward on a number of occasions many valuable opinions, which 
radiated with his ideology of marching forward in exploration. 
To the best of my memory, he raised six valuable opinions. 
  1. The law of value is "a great school." After suffering 
the serious setbacks in "removing bourgeois rights," "providing 
free meals," and the "communist wind characterized by extreme 
equalitarianism and the indiscriminate, unpaid-for transfer of 
resources from one collective to another or from one level of 
ownership to another," he realized that China is a country with 
an underdeveloped market economy, that it is necessary to 
vigorously develop the production of commodities as well as 
commodity exchange, and that peasants must not be exploited. 
  2. It would take China 100 years to catch up with advanced 
capitalist countries. China's socialist society could be 
divided into two stages: Underdeveloped socialist society and 
developed socialist society. He also predicted that the latter 
would last longer than the former. 
  3. The economic strategy of taking agriculture as the 
foundation and industry as the leading factor and the opinion of 
arranging the national economic priorities in the order of 
agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. 
  4. The idea of attaining the strategic objective in two 
steps: First, set up independent and comparatively complete 
industrial and national economic systems; and second, achieve 
the four modernizations of agriculture, industry, national 
defense, and science and technology. This idea was advanced in 
Premier Zhou's government work report to the first session of 
the third NPC held at the turn of 1964 and 1965. The standard 
term of the four modernizations in use now originated from this 
report. 
  5. Support for the pilot scheme of leading comrades of the 
central authorities in establishing trusts. This indicated that 
Chairman Mao was aware of the drawbacks of managing the economy 
by administrative means by the early 1960's. 
  6. The idea of "two participations, one reform, and 
three-way combination (cadre participation in productive labor 
and worker participation in management; reform of irrational and 
outdated rules and regulations; and close cooperation among 
workers, cadres, and technicians)." This meant applying the 
party's mass line to management of enterprises, a practice which 
was never found in enterprise management in the Soviet Union or 
in capitalist countries. 
  At the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central 
Committee in September 1957, Chairman Mao mistakenly changed the 
scientific thesis of the Eighth CPC National Congress on the 
primary contradiction of society, but at the 10th Plenary 
Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee in 1962, he still 
made socialist construction a central task. In January 1958, he 
said: From this year on, "the party should focus on 
technological revolution." In late 1958 when meeting with 
foreign guests, he said that China is making a new revolution, a 
revolution against earth and nature. In the period around the 
National Day of 1959 when receiving foreign guests, he also 
said: In the next 10 to 20 years, we will concentrate our 
energy on economic development. Only in reality, he did not act 
as he said. 
  Launching the Great Cultural Revolution was a glaring 
mistake 
which had a bearing on the overall situation. Nothing of the 
movement itself can be regarded as positive, and a historical 
conclusion on it was made long ago. Nevertheless, during the 
Great Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao still made important 
contributions to improving the international environment for 
China's socialist construction. He put forward the theory of 
the three worlds and the important principle that China will 
never seek hegemony. In addition, he succeeded in foiling U.S. 
attempt to enforce a diplomatic blockade of China. Elderly 
comrades must remember that one of the major events that 
attracted worldwide attention in the 1970's was that Chairman 
Mao and Premier Zhou made an important contribution to 
normalization of Sino-U.S. relations by seizing upon the 
opportunity offered by Richard Nixon, who expressed willingness 
to improve Sino-U.S. relations after he became master of the 
White House. Immediately after that, China established 
diplomatic relations with Japan, Canada, Italy, the Federal 
Republic of Germany (FRG), and Australia, thus greatly breaking 
the 20-year-old blockade initiated by the United States. After 
establishing diplomatic relations with these countries, China 
also improved economic relations with them. At that time, the 
Gang of Four, while keeping up a terrific row, tried by hook or 
by crook to prevent China from making contacts with the West. 
The "snail incident" [not further specified] must remain fresh 
in the memory of many comrades. However, with the support of 
Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou prevailed over all dissenting views 
and opened the door wide to introduce Western technology and 
equipment into China. In the 1970's, China imported 22 sets of 
major equipment from 10 countries including Japan, the FRG, and 
the United States. Does everybody not see clearly the positive 
role the equipment has played in China's economic development? 
  At this point I recall the well-known verses of our great 
patriotic poet Qu Yuan: "The way stretched endlessly ahead, I 
shall search heaven and earth." On the endless road of China's 
revolution and development, Chairman Mao made untiring efforts 
to explore and clear the way to forge ahead. In the early days 
of New China he pondered over the strategy for building up 
socialism which complied with China's actual conditions. He 
made concentrated efforts in this respect in 1956 and in the 
first half of 1957. Thereafter, he committed "leftist" mistakes 
but did not give up his exploration until he died. We may sum 
up his efforts this way: He was correct when he made first 
explorations and advanced many important ideas which can serve 
as long-term guidance. Later his exploration proceeded in both 
correct and incorrect directions and ended up with the 
10-year-old tumultuous Great Cultural Revolution. Therefore, it 
should be admitted that his exploration was not successful. 
There are no ready-made models to copy in building socialism in 
a big country in the east with a backward economy and culture 
like China. Making mistakes in such an exploration is 
understandable, but is still deplorable. Concerning this point, 
the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of the 
Party" pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes are, after 
all, ones committed by a great proletarian revolutionary." "His 
tragedy lies in the fact that when he committed great mistakes, 
he still repeatedly called on the entire party membership to 
earnestly study the works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin and still 
believed that his theories and practice agreed with Marxism and 
were necessary for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship." 
  Fortunately, with the end of the Great Cultural Revolution 
and the rectification of the party's guiding ideology, our party 
finally discovered the strategy for building up socialism which 
tallies with China's actual conditions. This strategy was 
gradually formed after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, and this is the path charted by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, a path which has been confirmed by the 14th CPC 
National Congress. This is the road we must follow in 
developing socialism in China, in enabling China to become a 
prosperous and strong country and to gain a foothold among other 
countries in the world, and in ensuring that our socialist cause 
will withstand risks in a more effective way and be always 
invincible. Our comrades can decide for themselves: If we had 
followed the course favored by those who advocated resolutely 
upholding whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made and 
unswervingly following whatever instructions he gave, rather 
than the course charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, would the 
historic leap forward over the last decade and more have been 
possible? Would we have been able to stand up to the tests of 
the political upheaval and of the drastic change in the former 
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe several years ago? 
  The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics 
is the product of the great practice of reform and opening up 
and bears the distinctive imprint of the times. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has made important and historic contribution in this 
regard, which everybody can see for himself. In fact Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping began to rectify the erroneous ideological and 
political lines as early as 1975, displaying his great political 
and theoretical courage. At that time he said: "It is 
necessary to overhaul and consolidate the Army, to reorganize 
industrial production, and to straighten things out in every 
field of work." Because all this, in essence, amounted to 
negating the Great Cultural Revolution, which was not allowed by 
Chairman Mao, Deng Xiaoping was ousted once more. After 1977, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping undertook the strenuous task of leading 
the whole party in rectifying the erroneous ideological and 
political lines, beginning the mission by repudiating the 
doctrine of the "two whatevers." The documents included in the 
1975-82 volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
convincingly reveal that after being reinstated, he was a de 
facto principal policy decisionmaker of the campaign against the 
erroneous ideological and political lines. After the 12th CPC 
National Congress, the party Central Committee adopted a series 
of major policy resolutions on the reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive to bring up a new situation of socialist 
construction, but most of these resolutions were based on 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's suggestions. The documents contained in 
the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" 
recorded accurately the historic contributions he made in the 
10-year period and his foresight and sagacity as the chief 
architect of our reform, of the opening policy, and of the 
modernization program. While reading the two books our comrades 
will have little difficulty in finding out most of the nine 
contents of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics summarized in the report to the 14th CPC 
National Congress are contained in the two books, where you can 
find the source of the contents and their brilliant expositions. 
Therefore, it occurred to me that just as Comrade Mao Zedong 
was worthy of the practice of crowning the thought created in 
the course of China's revolution and development, which was an 
embodiment of the combined wisdom of the entire party, with his 
personal name, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is also worthy of the 
practice of preceding the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics created under the new historical 
conditions, which is also an embodiment of the combined wisdom 
of the entire party, with his personal name. 
  In the process of exploring the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Xiaoping incorporated all 
the positive results Chairman Mao achieved in his exploration, 
which can still serve as guidance at the present stage including 
those correct ideas which were not acted on or were in fact 
later negated by Chairman Mao himself. However, what is most 
important is that Comrade Deng Xiaoping drew lessons from 
Chairman Mao's mistakes, especially his mistakes in initiating 
the Great Cultural Revolution, thus changing the bad thing into 
a good one. So Comrade Xiaoping said: "It appears the event 
(the Great Cultural Revolution) was a bad thing, but, in the 
final analysis, it was a good thing, because it enabled people 
to think things out for themselves and see clearly where our 
drawbacks lie." "The present principles and policies are 
exactly based on the conclusion we deduced from the Great 
Cultural Revolution." (pp 172, 223) 
  How has the erroneous Great Cultural Revolution prompted the 
formation of new ideas and new theories? Comrade Xiaoping said: 
"The most fundamental lesson is that we must gain a clear idea 
of socialism as well as communism and of the way to build 
socialism." During the Great Cultural Revolution, the Gang of 
Four absurdly claimed that poor socialism and communism is 
better than affluent capitalism. Comrade Xiaoping said: "It 
stands to reason that affluent capitalism is undesirable, but 
how can we advocate poor socialism and communism? As a result, 
China has stagnated. This compelled us to reconsider our 
problems. After consideration we decided that the first thing 
we must do was to uphold socialism. To uphold socialism, we 
must first of all shake off poverty and backwardness, vigorously 
develop productive forces, and give expression of priorities of 
socialism over capitalism. To achieve this, we must shift the 
focal point of work to the four modernizations and regard the 
four modernizations as the objective to be attained in the 
coming years. At the same time, to avoid making the same 
mistakes as we did in the past, we must not close the country to 
international interchange any more, must arouse the people's 
enthusiasm, and must formulate open and reform policies." (pp 
223-224) In this passage, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly told us 
the relationship between the formation of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the positive and 
negative historical experiences. The task of achieving the four 
modernizations, the need for the whole party to focus on 
developing productive forces, to give expression to the 
superiority of socialism over capitalism in helping develop 
productive forces, and other viewpoints, were set forth by the 
first generation of central leadership headed by Chairman Mao, 
but they were discarded afterwards. The erroneous Great 
Cultural Revolution proved from the negative side the 
correctness of these viewpoints. After the disastrous Great 
Cultural Revolution, when the questions of peace and development 
have become two top priorities on the international agenda, 
after socialism has suffered serious setback in many places in 
the world, and after we have introduced reform and the open 
policy for a certain period, however, we were not content with 
correcting our mistakes and restoring correct viewpoints, but 
greatly developed the correct viewpoints and put forward new 
viewpoints, which are, for instance: The socialist economy was 
a planned commodity economy based on public ownership; China was 
still in the primary stage of socialism; socialism was not 
antagonistic to the market economy; China could not separate its 
economic development from the rest of the world; and so on. It 
was on the basis of these viewpoints that the series of 
principles and policies for reform and opening up, the basic 
line of "one central task, two basic points," and the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics gradually took 
shape. 
  Studying and propagating the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is an important and long-term task 
for our comrades in ideological and theoretical circles. 
Gaining a clear idea of the relationship between this theory 
and the explorations Chairman Mao made will help us understand 
the source of this theory and the enormous cost we have paid for 
it. This in turn will help us understand the difficulty in 
theoretical exploration and deepen our understanding of this 
theory. All this will prove useful in making our work a success. 
  The current domestic and international situation provides us 
with a rare and favorable opportunity for economic development. 
Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines laid down by the 
14th national party congress and after conducting earnest 
studies and investigations and evaluating past experience, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee timely 
made the "Decision on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure," which drew up a blueprint 
for setting up a socialist market economic structure. The 
decision is our program for action in economic restructuring in 
the 1990's. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently said: "We must seize 
upon the opportunity to step up reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive in an effort to initially set up a socialist 
market economic structure by the end of the century, achieving 
the second-step strategic goal of giving the people a 
comparatively comfortable life, and elevating our overall 
national strength to a new level." The task is heavy and the 
road ahead is long. In his talks given during his south China 
tour, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in all earnestness and 
sincerity: "We have engaged in building socialism for several 
decades only. China is still in the primary stage of socialism. 
It will take a long historical period, as well as the 
unremitting effort of several generations, a dozen generations, 
or even scores of generations, to consolidate and develop the 
socialist system, so we must not treat the task lightly." (pp 
379-380) I hope our comrades, under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, will firmly uphold the party's basic line for a 
hundred years, get down to earth to work, evaluate their 
experience while taking part in practice, study new problems, 
and explore new ways for solving new problems, thus making their 
due contributions to enriching and developing the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] In reforming criminals, China persistently displays 
a humanitarian spirit and protects inmates' basic rights 
according to the law. Over the last several decades, it has 
successively invested several billion yuan in building, 
renovating, and expanding a number of prison facilities, 
enabling each inmate to occupy an average of more than 5 square 
meters in cell floor space. 
  The food allowance of inmates across the country has 
increased step by step, approaching the average living standards 
of local residents. Despite the limited food allowance, 
Shanghai prison prepares nutritious food for inmates and ensures 
enough good food for them. Furthermore, prisons in various 
localities have Muslim kitchens for Islamic inmates. 
  In China's prisons today, the inmates enjoy not only the 
basic right of subsistence but also the right to education. The 
reform- through-labor institutions educate inmates, with courses 
ranging from literacy classes to junior middle school education. 
To date, the reform-through-labor institutions across the 
country have run more than 12,000 educational classes. Some 
1.15 million inmates have graduated from those classes and 
received diplomas. The institutions have also run job skill 
training classes so that inmates can earn their own living after 
leaving prison and return to society. So far, 810,000 inmates 
have received job skill certificates. 
  A nationwide election for new leading bodies at county and 
township levels was held in 1993. On 25 December, some 1,200 
inmates in Wuhan city, Hubei, who have not been deprived of 
political rights cast their votes according to the law during 
those elections. [video shows clips of new prison buildings, a

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Wang Yunfeng (3769 0061 1496): "A </F>
Rare Case of Exceptionally Huge Explosion"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  I </H6>
  On 26 November 1993, an exceptionally huge explosion rarely 
seen in China occurred at the Nanling Chemical Factory, which is 
situated at the foot of Yangming Shan in Shuangpai County, Hunan 
Province. 
  At 1605, following a deafening explosion at the emulsion 
explosive plant, a black mushroom-like cloud, mixed with blood, 
flesh, machine parts, and rubble, soared hundreds of meters into 
the sky. The powerful blast pushed workers and staff members in 
factories some two km away to the ground and shattered the glass 
of many windows in the Shuangpai County seat five km away. Even 
people in Yongzhou City 30 km away heard the blast, and their 
doors and windows shook. After the huge blast, the survivors 
witnessed a pitiful sight: A workshop of several hundred square 
meters had been leveled. The factory building, flowers, and 
trees were all gone; so were the workers and staff members, who 
had just been working intensely and in an orderly fashion. Four 
cadres from the Lanzhou Military Region, who had come to 
Shuangpai County to fetch soldiers, as well as the wife of a 
company commander, were unfortunately killed in the accident 
after visiting the plant for less than five minutes. At another 
workshop some 100 meters away from the explosion point, the 
workers were "pushed" down to the second and third floors by the 
blast. As a result, 22 people were hurt, three of whom died 
despite being given emergency treatment. 
  After the accident, leaders and experts from Shuangpai 
County, Lingling Prefecture, and Hunan Province, as well as the 
Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense, 
and the Guangzhou Military Region, rushed to the explosion site. 
The aftermath of the accident was carried out in a tense and 
orderly manner. 
  According to an initial estimate, the accident caused over 
2.5 million yuan in direct economic losses. With the death toll 
currently standing at 61, this is the deadliest accident in the 
history of Hunan Province. 
  Emulsion explosives are widely used in national defense, 
economic, and other fields. Its explosive force is the same as 
high-explosive TNT, but it cannot be detonated by shooting at or 
burning it unless with a detonator. In the course of 
production, only when several kinds of material are mixed and 
stirred does it pose a danger, and the finished product cannot 
be detonated without a detonator. To ensure production safety, 
the factory manually operates all processes relating to the 
setting and packing of finished products to avoid collisions 
with machinery. To prevent sparks caused by friction in the 
nails of shoe soles, all workers are required to wear special 
shoes when going to work. To show considerations for smokers, a 
smoking area was set up some 50 meters from the factory gate. 
Professional safety personnel constantly shuttled back and 
forth in the workshop to inspect safety conditions. However, 
unexpectedly, the incident still occurred and took place in the 
setting and packing workshop for the finished product. As for 
the mixing workshop, only half of its building was destroyed in 
the explosion. 
<H6>  II </H6>
  Was the case of the exceptionally large explosion at the 
Nanling Chemical Factory an accident due to a safety lapse or a 
criminal case of artificial sabotage? 
  The Ministry of Public Security conducted a lot of 
meticulous 
work on this core issue in an attempt to find clues. 
  After talking with the factory director, workshop chiefs, 
and 
some workers, the public security personnel found an important 
clue. At 1800 on 26 November, accompanied by his father, a young 
worker named Liu from the No. 1 workshop told the workshop chief 
that the accident was probably caused by a young worker, Tan 
Zhixin, from the same workshop. Two days earlier, Liu, another 
young worker named Wang, and Tan took some detonators and fuses 
from a young worker named Su at the Hunan Equipment Factory. 
The workshop chief also said that Tan repeatedly spread word 
that he wanted to blow up the No. 1 workshop. After comparing 
and analyzing the circumstances, public security personnel 
concluded that Tan was an important suspect because he had both 
the motive and the tools to commit the crime. 
  To make the origin of the detonators and fuses absolutely 
clear, four public security policemen were ordered to rush to 
the Hunan Equipment Factory, which is over 100 km away, in the 
small hours of the morning to investigate. Su admitted 
supplying Tan with detonators and fuses. Facts proved that Tan 
was the principal culprit in the fatal incident. The criminal 
was a careless and casual worker. He was punished by the 
factory and the public security management department for 
causing an accident while driving a motorcycle and for 
participating in gambling. Later, he was refused a transfer 
from the packing workshop to become a factory driver. As a 
result, he harbored a grievance. In early November, he told a 
coworker that since the No. 1 workshop had treated him badly, he 
wanted to blow it up. On 24 November, taking advantage of a 
workshop holiday, Tan, Liu, and Wang went to the Hunan Equipment 
Factory to obtain 17 detonators and two fuses. They returned to 
the factory the following day. While drinking wine at coworker 
Zhang's home that evening, Tan again grumbled: I don't want to 
work at the No. 1 workshop any longer. I want to be transferred 
to the factory car transport department. If they agree, that's 
fine. If they don't, I'll blow up the No. 1 workshop. Saying 
this, he pulled out some detonators from a brown paper envelop 
stuck in his belt and displayed it. After eating, he 
deliberately took two detonators to a single-persons' dormitory 
to try them out. 
  At noon on 26 November, while eating lunch at the food stall 
of a self-employed person in the factory, he revealed to workers 
sitting at the same table with him the idea that a person should 
eat his fill and eat well before he dies. He again threatened 
to blow up the No. 1 workshop. At 1600, when arriving at the 
No. 1 workshop, Tan first greeted a female worker and then, 
catching sight of Wang, asked repeatedly: "Why are you still 
here?" Catching his meaning, Wang immediately left the 
workshop. On eventually seeing Liu, Tan asked: Why are you 
still here? Liu said: I haven't finished packing the 
explosives. Tan gave him a hint by showing him the detonators 
in his trouser pocket, and the latter immediately left the 
workshop. A few minutes later, Tan unscrupulously committed the 
horrifying deed. He also ended his criminal life in the 
explosion.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (CNS)--Newly-appointed director 
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Mr Chen 
Guangyi, took up his position today when he held a meeting with 
senior company officials. He expressed the hope that the CAAC 
staff would strive to overcome difficulties they may face in 
order to create a good image of CAAC and build up its reputation. 
  Vice Premier Mr Zou Jiahua announced new senior appointments 
to the CAAC at the meeting. Mr Chen Guangyi was appointed 
director with Mr Jiang Zhuping, Mr Yan Zhixiang, Mr Li Zhao, Mr 
Shen Yuankang and Mr Bao Peide appointed deputy directors. 
  Mr Chen Guangyi said that his appointment as director by the 
central authorities had been made only ten days before his 
taking up his duties and he therefore needed time to study the 
situation. He felt, however, that great expectations were held 
regarding his appointment by the country's leaders including 
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
and Vice Premier Zou Jiahua as well as the country as a whole 
and elsewhere. 
  Mr Chen said that there were many difficulties and 
weaknesses 
regarding aviation in the country and there was much pressure to 
improve the situation. He and all the CAAC staff would do their 
best to handle their work, make adjustments where necessary and 
introduce reforms. Close attention would be paid to air safety 
and to the maintenance of healthy and rapid development of CAAC.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Localities Told to Spend </F>
More on Disease Control"] 
  [Text] Local governments are being urged by the State to 
take new steps to eradicate the various endemic diseases that 
currently threaten the health of more than 500 million Chinese 
farmers. 
  Chen Minzhang, the Minister of Public Health, stressed on 
Wednesday in Beijing that provincial governments should further 
increase their budgets for endemic disease control and people 
from all walks of life must be persuaded to join the national 
campaign against endemic illnesses. 
  Endemic diseases--including snail fever, iodine deficiency 
diseases (IDD), the plague, and endemic fluoresces--have been 
reported in 2,413 counties, or 85 percent of the counties in 
China. 
  Chen made the remarks at the founding of the Endemic 
Diseases 
Society of China. 
  The society is a nongovernmental organization composed of 
specialists in endemic illnesses and volunteers from different 
State departments, institutes and industrial enterprises. 
  The society was founded to help spread State policies and 
regulations on endemic diseases control and launch publicity 
campaigns. 
  It will also organize academic exchanges to introduce new 
techniques on prevention and cure of the illnesses to 
grass-roots health workers. 
  The minister said he hoped a national endemic disease 
control 
network will be established as a result of the work of the 
society. 
  Snail fever, or schistosomiasis, a parasitic illness 
eliminated in the early 1950's, reappeared in the early 1980s. 
  Currently, endemic snail fever is rampant in 381 counties in 
the country. 
  More than 3.6 billion square meters of land in China's lake 
and mountain regions are still infested with snails putting 40 
million people in danger. 
  The most serious epidemic cases are in rural areas and in 
poor counties. 
  In 1991, the disease was found in 1,212 counties, accounting 
for 43 percent of the country's total. About 300 million people 
are threatened, 26 percent of the total population. 
  There are 43 million dental fluoresces patients and 1.6 
million skeletal fluorosis victims. 
  IDD, like endemic flouride poisoning, is prevalent in all 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except 
Shanghai. 
  IDD has become one of the major factors affecting the mental 
development of Chinese children. 
  On the same day, a deputy provincial governor of Shanxi 
Province said the provincial government has decided to allocate 
an additional 1 million yuan (about $175,000) annually starting 
this year for endemic disease control in the province. 
  The regular budget for the work in Shanxi, one of the 
provinces in China that has a major problem with endemic 
diseases, is 1.4 million yuan about ($245,000) each year. 
  The province has five kinds of endemic diseases in 107 
counties and prefectures, 81 per cent of the province's total. 
  Some 3.4 million of the residents, or 12 percent of the 
province's total population, suffer from the various illnesses. 
  Zhang Weiqing, the deputy provincial governor, said the 
provincial government is to loan some 3 million yuan (about 
$526,000) each year to help develop health-related industrial 
enterprises. 
  The province is to subsidize scientific research institutes 
by as much as 500,000 yuan (about $87,000) each year for 
carrying out research in the field. Researchers who achieve 
outstanding results will be rewarded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "Multi-Economic Sectors Join Hands </F>
To Boost Shanghai's Economy"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Multi-economic 
sectors in China's largest economic center are joining hands to 
boost the economy. 
  Shanghai's financial income last year climbed to 24.23 
billion yuan, an increase of 30 percent over the previous year. 
  Economists here attributed the success to the efforts of 
state enterprises, which still serve as the backbone in economic 
development, and the expansion of other economic sectors 
including rural industries and foreign-funded and private 
businesses. 
  The Shanghai municipal government collected 3.65 billion 
yuan 
in taxes from foreign-funded enterprises and organizations last 
year, accounting for 16 percent of the city's total, and four 
billion yuan in taxes from rural industrial enterprises. 
  Starting business without a single penny from the state, 
more 
than 138,000 private businesses in China's most populous city 
delivered about 500 million yuan in taxes to the state last 
year, accounting for two percent of the industrial and 
commercial taxes in Shanghai. 
  According to the economists, China's policy to encourage 
other economic sectors to develop alongside the state sector 
since 1979, when the country began the reform and open policy, 
has paid off. 
  Coming into existence in the 1970s, rural enterprises in the 
Shanghai area have burgeoned since 1990 when the government 
allocated more flexible policies in favor of rural industrial 
development. 
  Last year saw more than 20,000 rural enterprises generate an 
output value totalling 80 billion yuan, accounting for 28 
percent of Shanghai's gross industrial output value of 280 
billion yuan. 
  "Rural enterprises have become a pillar in Shanghai's 
outlying counties," a municipal official in charge of 
agriculture said. 
  The annual income of farmers in the Shanghai area has taken 
the lead for ten years running, surpassing 2,600 yuan per capita 
last year, three times the country's average. 
  Shanghai began to import foreign investment on a large scale 
and improved its investment conditions in 1979. 
  By the end of 1993, the city had approved 6,939 
foreign-funded enterprises with contractual investment climbing 
to 13.7 billion U.S. dollars. Included were 3,650 projects 
involving seven billion U.S. dollars approved last year. 
  According to the municipal government, 3,500 foreign-funded 
enterprises which opened to operation generated output value 
amounting to 47.6 billion yuan last year, accounting for 17 
percent of the city's total, and exported 1.6 billion U.S. 
dollars worth of goods, up 50 percent and accounting for 22 
percent of the city's total. 
  "These enterprises are becoming a new force in the city's 
economy, particularly the high-tech industry," a municipal 
official noted. 
  Through 14 years of development, the private economic sector 
is displaying its talent in the service trade. 
  A survey shows that its retail sales volume occupies 11 
percent of the city's total. 
  So far Shanghai has more than 1,000 private businesses 
engaged in the development and consulting services for science 
and technology. 
  The economists predicted that these businesses will play a 
bigger role in turning scientific findings into productivity. 
  They agreed that the development of non-state economic 
sectors will not affect the main position of the state economy. 
  With the deepening of the national economic reform, the 
major 
state enterprises will fully display their superiority and 
continue to lead the municipal economic development. 
  To boost the market economy, according to the economists, 
economic sectors under different ownership arrangements are 
learning from each other. 
  Many major state enterprises have introduced the operational 
mechanism of foreign-funded enterprises. 
  In addition, rural and private businesses are striving to 
modernize themselves technically. 
  The economists believed that such multi-economic sectors 
will 
benefit social development and effectively promote the city's 
economic development.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 7 (XINHUA) -- The largest 
industrial center in east China has become a base of the 
high-tech telecommunications industry in the country. 
  Statistics show that in 1993 the telecommunications sector 
reported a sales value of more than 6.8 billion yuan and more 
than 1.6 billion yuan in profits and taxes, doubling the figures 
for the previous year. 
  There are now 18 high-tech telecommunications enterprises in 
Shanghai, ten of which are joint-funded ones. They cover wire 
and wireless telecommunications, satellite telecommunications, 
transmission equipment and terminals. 
  A senior official in charge of the sector said that the 
partnership of major foreign corporations was a major cause of 
the rapid development of the industry. 
  In 1993 the telecommunications sector agreed upon seven 
projects altogether with the Siemens company of Germany, Ricoh 
of Japan and AT&amp;T of the U.S. They involve a total investment 
of 200 million U.S. dollars. 
  When completed, these projects will increase their output 
value by six billion yuan. The Shanghai Ricoh company alone 
will add two billion yuan. It is planning to turn out 400,000 
fax machines a year.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai city in 
east China has formulated a plan for accelerating development on 
coastal waters. 
  The plan notes that Shanghai now has a land area of 6,340.5 
square kilometers, but its coastal waters cover 7,226 square 
kilometers. 
  "The Shanghai Marine Development Plan" constitutes a major 
part of Shanghai's current urban planning, it says. 
  By the year 2000, the proportion of the gross output value 
of 
the marine economy in Shanghai in the total output value in the 
city will rise by 0.5 to 1 percent [figures as received]. 
  The focus of the development plan is on the coastal belts 
and 
nearby waters, involving opening up of oil and gas projects, 
manufacturing of oceanic medicines, underwater projects and 
surveying for mineral resources on the sea floor.

Corporation reporter, at SEF headquarters in Taipei from the 
"Hookup" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Yang] Regarding matters relating to the 
Chiao-Tang talks, SEF [Straits Exchange Foundation], following 
approval by the Mainland Affairs Council and confirmation during 
a SEF meeting, dispatched two letters giving a specific reply to 
ARATS [Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Strait]. In 
the first letter, SEF agreed to ARATS' suggestion on holding the 
Chiao- Tang talks on 31 January. SEF said that Vice Chairman 
Chiao Jen-ho will leave for Peking [Beijing] on 31 January for a 
five-day visit. The agenda includes consultations on related 
matters concerning the meeting between SEF and ARATS and on 
increasing communications and understanding between the two 
organizations. The second letter welcomed ARATS' suggestion on 
holding early talks on the 4th follow-up working-level 
discussions of the Ku-Wang talks, following the Taipei talks. 
SEF stressed, however, that the talks should not involve 
political and legal issues. 
  [SEF Spokesman Shih Chi-ping] Working-level consultations 
between the two sides of the Strait should not involve political 
issues and be mixed with political views. However, only by 
taking into account the reality of different legal systems 
between the two sides of the Strait; only then, can we work out 
a realistic and effective arrangement to solve problems. 
  [Yang] Shih Chi-ping stressed the agenda of the Chiao-Tang 
talks will include the SEF and ARATS meeting and related 
matters, and further discussion of the differences which cropped 
up during the past three working-level consultations, so as to 
make arrangements for the 4th working-level talks. The second 
Ku-Wang talks, however, will be not included in the agenda.

  [Text] Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, said yesterday [6 January] 
that while direct shipping services between the mainland and 
Taiwan will be inevitable in the future, the time and methods of 
the services involve certain technical issues that cannot be 
decided by us alone. He said that to further develop 
cross-strait relations, the government is now taking the 
initiative in handling the issue with a positive, pragmatic, and 
sensible attitude. 
  Hsiao said that he is not in favor of controlling exports to 
the mainland. 
  Commenting on a statement made by the Directorate of 
Budgets, 
Accounting, and Statistics on 5 January that the country's 
export dependency on the mainland has approached the danger 
point, Hsiao pointed out that there is no danger point for the 
development of cross-strait economic development and trade. He 
said he does not believe that exports to the mainland should be 
controlled when they approach the 10-percent level. He said 
that such a control is not in the interests of the country 
because it would hurt us first before hurting the other side.

  [Text] A top ROC [Republic of China] trade negotiator has 
said that if Washington and Taipei can reach preliminary 
agreement on tariff cuts when they meet this month, Taiwan will 
be prepared to lower some of them by April or May for the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  (Huang Yen-tao), director general of the Board of Foreign 
Trade and the government's chief trade negotiator, pledged not 
to give in easily to Washington's demand when he meets with U.S. 
negotiators on January 19. 
  The U.S. Trade Representative Office gave the Board of 
Foreign Trade a list of 2,785 products last year in November on 
which the U.S. [words indistinct] wants Taiwan to cut trade 
tariffs on as a prerequisite for its entry into the GATT. Of 
the 2,785 products, Taipei was given a December 3 deadline to 
lower tariffs by 50 percent on 699 items. Among the 699 items 
she mentioned in the ultimatum, 514 were auto and industrial 
manufacturing products. Taipei rejected Washington's request in 
December last year but agreed to discuss the issue in bilateral 
tariffs negotiation early this year.

  [Text] At the province's commendation meeting held on 6 
January in honor of the non-government enterprises engaging in 
scientific and technological research work, Cheng Weigao, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech 
in which he put forward: We should emancipate our mind; renew 
our concepts; deepen the reform; enhance the rendering of 
services; and develop as soon as possible a large number of 
non-government enterprises with high standard, large scale, and 
good benefits so as to promote the faster development of the 
province's economy. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: Leadership at all levels should 
overcome the leftist influence and change the sub-standard 
concept cropping up in regarding science and technology as 
productive forces and in developing the market economy. Efforts 
should be made to deepen the reform, to readjust the policies, 
and to do a good job in stabilizing the establishment of a large 
number of non-government enterprises. This means that we should 
support and encourage by relaxing the policies' restrictions a 
large number of scientific and technological personnel to open 
more non-government enterprises in line with the needs of 
markets both at home and abroad. This also means that we should 
apply preferential policies and good services to attracting a 
large number of outstanding scientific and technological 
personnel throughout the country to work in the province. We 
should also conduct reform among the state-owned scientific 
research units with regard to having the state-owned 
institutions in this regard be operated by individuals. We 
should support a number of non-government units to open 
joint-venture enterprises with foreign businessmen or firms. 
  Cheng Weigao urged the leadership at all levels to enhance 
their services and to truly deal with the problems in which the 
public opinions on scientific and technological personnel is 
unfair, policies include discrimination against these personnel, 
the regulations and rules on these personnel are seriously in a 
mess, and nobody is supporting these personnel. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: Non-government enterprises should 
also deepen their internal reform and upgrade their quality so 
as to better bring the role of non-government enterprises in 
being a fine mechanism. 
  At yesterday's commendation meeting, the Baoding city 
people's government and the Applied Technologies Development 
Institute of Xingtai city delivered reports on their experiences 
gained in this regard. The participating representatives will 
pay a visit to the three institutes on 7 January, including the 
Apartment Construction Technology Institute of Baoding city. 
  At yesterday's commendation meeting 10 industrialists from 
the state-owned enterprises being operated by individuals, 
including the Hebei technology development company, as well as 
from various counties were respectively awarded. Presenting 
medals and honorary certificates to the awarded industrialists 
and enterprises were leading personnel from the provincial level 
organs, including Cheng Weigao, Li Zhanshu, Liu Zuotian, and 
Wang Shusen; Hui Yongzheng, vice minister of science and 
technology; and Wang Zhiguo, responsible person from China 
Association for Science and Technology.

<F P=106> [By Correspondant Meng Shengjun (1322 0524 0689) and </F>
Reporter Lou Zhenxu (1236 3791 7312): "The Fifth Standing 
Committee Meeting of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress 
Held the Plenary Session"] 
  [Text] The plenary session of the fifth standing committee 
meeting of the eighth provincial people's congress continued on 
the morning of 20 December. Li Yongjin, vice chairman of the 
standing committee of the provincial people's congress, chaired 
the session. 
  Entrusted by the meeting of chairman and vice chairmen, 
Zhang 
Liyin, chairman of the commission on politics and law under the 
provincial people's congress standing committee, made a report 
on examination of the local rules and regulations and opinions 
on examining the local rules and regulations. Zhang Liyin said: 
According to the decision made at the meeting of chairman and 
vice chairmen, from September to December, we comprehensively 
examined the local rules and regulations formulated and approved 
before the end of 1992. The statistics showed that 81 local 
rules and regulations were examined this time. Through 
examinations, 54 continued to be effective, 4 had to be 
abolished, and 23 continued to be effective but should partially 
be revised. Zhang Liyin set forth in his report: We suggest 
that the provincial people's congress standing committee should 
make a decision on abolishing the local rules and regulations 
that should be abolished and should organize forces to firmly 
work out a draft resolution on revision and strive to basically 
finish the revision tasks in 1994. 
  Entrusted by the provincial government, Liu Deyun, chairman 
of the provincial family planning commission, made a report on 
family planning work. He said: According to the analysis and 
calculation by the provincial population surveying team and the 
investigations on the examples in family planning work, the 
province was expected to be able to fulfill the population 
control plan. Simultaneously, the overall family planning work 
level was improved when compared with that of previous years. 
After citing that the grass-roots areas were weak in the basic 
family planning work, their input to the family planning work 
was seriously insufficient, and the grass- roots statistic 
figures were not real, he urged that in 1994, the leaders at 
various levels should further upgrade their awareness of 
"personally engaging in the family planning work and assuming 
overall responsibility," exert efforts to grasp the grass roots 
and lay a good foundation, and concentrate efforts on solving 
the problems due to the failure to grasp or not effectively 
grasp the village-level family planning work. 
  Entrusted by the provincial government, Song Xilin, director 
of the provincial land management bureau, delivered a report on 
implementation of the laws and regulations on land management. 
He said: So far, all cities and counties across the province 
have completely finished the establishment of the basic farmland 
protection areas and protected 76.075 million mu of farmland, 
including 70.745 million mu of cultivated area; and 72 percent 
of the cultivated areas were protected. From the beginning of 
1992 to the first half of 1993, more than 90 pieces of state 
land were sold, more than 50,000 mu of land were sold, and 1.85 
billion yuan of money were earned from sales of land. From the 
beginning of last year, the province signed 38 contracts on 
large-scale land development with foreign businessmen and sold 
rights on utilization of 43,000 mu of land; and was able to use 
$1.7 billion through these channels. Town and township 
enterprises began to experiment with the paid use of land. Song 
Xilin also set forth opinions on the existing problems and asked 
standing committee members for examinations and discussions. 
  Entrusted by the provincial government, Gong Huanwen, 
chairman of the provincial planning committee, delivered a 
report on the construction of key projects. He said: This 
year, the province arranged 159 key projects, an increase of 56 
projects or 54.4 percent over the previous year. The total 
investment was 51.5 billion yuan. The planned investment of the 
fiscal year was 10.82 billion yuan, (excluding the investment in 
preparatory projects and the Beijing-Jiulong railway project,) 
an increase of 6.066 billion yuan or 127.6 percent over the 
previous year. All this appropriately helped promote the 
fulfillment of the plan for investment in fixed assets and the 
increase in the national economy. After reporting the provincial 
situation in the investment in key projects, the progress of key 
projects, the main measures that were adopted, and the existing 
problems, Gong Huanwen pointed out that the provincial 
government would ask relevant departments to organize special 
leading bodies to generally and thoroughly examine and 
investigate the key projects with excessive construction funds, 
set forth opinions on solving the problems in this regard, and 
work out measures for controlling overspending on key projects 
so as to reduce construction investment and alleviate the 
contradictions between supply and demand of capital. 
  Present at the session were Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the 
standing committee of the provincial people's congress; and 
Zhang Zhenhuai, Liu Zongyao, and Gao Yongtang, vice chairmen of 
the standing committee of the provincial people's congress. 
  Present at the session as nonvoting delegates were Guo 
Shichang, vice governor of the provincial government; Ping 
Yijie, president of the provincial court; and Zhang Dianshan, 
deputy chief procurator of the provincial procuratorate.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Zhu Fu (4376 4395) "Treasure the Opportunity, </F>
Dare To Pioneer and Try, and Seek Greater Development in the 
Course of Reform"] 
  [Text] Leading personnel, including Wang Qun, secretary of 
the autonomous regional party committee; Qian Fenyong, deputy 
secretary of the autonomous regional party committee; and Shen 
Shuji, vice chairman of the autonomous regional people's 
government; carried out investigation and study in Baotou city 
from 4 to 16 December. 
  Wang Qun and the leading personnel respectively held forums 
with leaders of Baotou city, the Baotou Iron and Steel Company, 
the First and Second Neimenggu Machine-Building Plants, the 
Neimenggu Aluminium Plant, and a number of city level 
enterprises. They also visited township enterprises in the 
suburban township of Houyingzi. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: We should apply the spirit of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
spirit of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping in educating cadres and the masses at present to 
enable them to discern that the establishment of socialist 
market economic systems represents a profound and great 
revolution, that the road in this regard must be followed, that 
the regression to the old ways of a planned economy is out of 
the question; and that we can not get ahead through the 
capitalist road. While it is natural for us to take risks in 
developing the market economy, we will encounter a "blind alley" 
and even greater risk and will "subjugate the party and the 
country" if we fail to conduct reform and to achieve 
development. There are many difficulties which enterprises are 
currently encountering and will encounter in the future in the 
course of achieving a large change. Only by overcoming these 
difficulties can they have a brilliant future. The state will 
issue a large number of measures for reforms in the year of 1994 
and the issuance will have important and crucial significance on 
the establishment of the socialist market economy system. We 
should educate cadres and the masses to clearly discern the 
situation and to correctly deal with relations between reform 
and development and between reform and stability; relations 
between the central authorities and localities, the state and 
enterprises, staff members and workers, and immediate and long- 
term interests. The opportunity we face has not changed. After 
15 years of reform and development, the national and 
international environments are now extremely favorable for us. 
It can be said that "everything is ready and all we need is an 
east wind". "An east wind" entails having the leadership at all 
levels dare to make efforts to pioneer and to display the spirit 
of pioneering the road of advance and if they do not, it entails 
their inability of paving the road to deepening reform, the 
turning of the quickening of development into empty talk, and 
losing the opportunity. 
  Wang Qun stressed: Our enterprises should conduct their 
development along the road of modernization, market, 
internationalization, and grouping. Large and medium-sized 
enterprises should take the lead in this regard, base themselves 
on international markets, gain ground in market competition, and 
seek self development. They should push forward reform as a 
whole and make a breakthroughs in the key aspects. The 
departments of governments, banks, industry and commerce, labor 
affairs, and insurance should cooperate with the quickening of 
reform. The emphasis of reform should be placed on enterprises 
and in large and medium-sized enterprises in particular. The 
orientation of enterprise reform is to establish modern 
enterprise systems and the current emphasis should be placed on 
conducting reform in the three internal systems. Leadership at 
all levels should integrate the spirit of the central decision 
with the principle of "three advantages" and grasp the essence 
of the "decision's" spirit. We should resolutely implement the 
spirit of "the decision" and proceed from reality in adopting 
ways and styles for reform. We may apply any method as long as 
it conforms with the "three advantages." Ways that prove 
effective in reforms should be popularized among localities. By 
no means should we always remain these ways in the period of 
"experimentation conducted by specific units." 
  Leading comrades including Wang Qun urged the leading organs 
and enterprises to pay attention to making scientific and 
technological progress, to pay special attention to studying 
managerial knowledge, to learn about markets, to master markets, 
and to upgrade their capability of controlling markets. In the 
final analysis, market competition means the competition of 
scientific and technological personnel and means that efforts 
should be made to upgrade the technological content of products 
and to join in the competition with high-quality and high-grade 
products. 
  Wang Qun said: In the historical change of establishing the 
systems of market economy, it is imperative to enhance the 
party's leadership; to strengthen the ideological work and the 
enforcement of discipline; and to bring our political strong 
points into full play. He also urged leading cadres to enhance 
their professional ambition and their sense of responsibility 
and their concept of the whole situation and to continuously and 
somehow create something or make progress in leading the program 
of effecting great change. 
  Wang Qun, Qian Fenyong, and Shen Shuji also put forward 
specific opinions on the practical problems encountered by 
enterprises.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, recently convened a conference of major responsible 
comrades of various departments, committees, districts, and 
counties and a working meeting of the secretary of the municipal 
party committee to conscientiously study ways to further deepen 
the anticorruption struggle. Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should 
resolutely implement the arrangements of the party Central 
committee and the State Council and adopt realistic and 
effective measures to fulfill the three tasks of the 
anticorruption struggle to be accomplished in the near future. 
We must win notable results by the end of this year and never 
do a superficial job so as to win the trust of the people. 
  Liu Fengyan, standing committee member of the municipal 
party 
committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection 
commission, gave a report at the working meeting. He said: The 
municipal party committee and government have adopted a firm 
attitude and carried out down-to-earth work to implement the 
arrangements of the party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the 
anticorruption struggle. Notable results have been won in some 
aspects. Tianjin started early and carried out solid work to 
check "wanton levies." It has by and large canceled the items of 
wanton levies according to the explicit order of the State 
Council. The municipal government publicized on two occasions 
195 items of wanton levies to be canceled, and a fairly good job 
has been done in this regard. After self-inspections, all 
districts, counties, and bureaus have also canceled more than 
300 items of wanton levies. The unhealthy trends of private 
travels abroad (beyond the border) with public expenses has been 
checked. Leading cadres of party and government organs 
conducted earnest self-inspection and self-correction in line 
with the five regulations on honesty and self-discipline. With 
municipal-level leading bodies taking the lead, leading bodies 
of departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, and 
bureaus as well as the units at the county or section level have 
held democratic meetings, where cadres who violated regulations 
took the initiative in reporting their problems to the 
organizations and corrected most of them, and where results of 
the self-inspection and self-correction activities were made 
public to cadres. The work to investigate and handle major and 
serious cases is being carried out in depth, and a number of 
criminal elements have been punished according to law. The 
municipal discipline inspection commission recently also 
organized inspection promotion groups and sent them to more than 
40 units to inspect how major work is carried out, thus 
developing in depth the anticorruption struggle. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: Tianjin's previous 
anticorruption struggle has developed in a healthy manner, and 
fairly good results have been achieved. However, development 
has been uneven. As the year is drawing to an end, we should 
pay more attention to and do a better job in the anticorruption 
struggle in line with the arrangements of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council and make sure that notable 
results are achieved by the end of this year. 
  Gao Dezhan put forward five demands on the in-depth 
anticorruption struggle: 
  First, we should further improve our understanding. Leading 
cadres at all levels should further intensify the study of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important theories on 
correcting party style, intensifying efforts to build a clean 
government, and opposing corruption, conscientiously implement 
the guidelines of the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin 
and Li Peng on the anticorruption struggle, surmount various 
obstacles, actively adhere to the principle of "attending to two 
tasks simultaneously and achieving competence in both," adopt a 
firm attitude to make the anticorruption struggle successful, 
and never do a superficial job and lose the trust of the people. 
  Second, we must fulfill all the three tasks of the 
anticorruption struggle to be accomplished in the near future in 
line with central arrangements. All departments, committees, 
offices, districts, counties, and bureaus should conduct an 
inspection on their previous anticorruption struggle to find out 
their problems and where they lag behind. After this, they 
should give prominence to work priorities, pay close attention 
to weak links, and solve problems one by one to achieve good 
results. Leading cadres who did a poor job in self-inspection 
and self- correction should step up efforts to take remedial 
measures and never be vague on this matter. The honesty, 
self-discipline, self-inspection, and self-correction of leading 
bodies and leading cadres should be made public for the 
supervision of the masses during the year-end democratic 
appraisal of performance. Mistakes found during the inspection 
should be corrected and dealt with according to regulations and 
never recur. We should pool efforts to step up investigation 
and handling of major and serious cases and conclude them more 
rapidly. Regarding the endeavor to check wanton levies and 
unhealthy trends in some trades, we should consolidate the 
achievements already won and adopt measures to make it still 
better. We must never slacken efforts in it. 
  Third, we should conscientiously implement the guidelines of 
the "circular on strictly banning waste and extravagance like 
using public funds to hold parties and buy gifts during the 1994 
New Year and Spring Festival period" issued by the general 
offices of the party Central Committee and the State Council and 
establish a new style of honesty. The municipality has also 
issued a document on this. Leading cadres at all levels should 
maintain honesty and self-discipline, set an example in honesty, 
and be clean and honest during the jubilant New Year and Spring 
Festival. This should be a practical criterion to judge the 
results of the previous anticorruption struggle and an important 
indicator to show whether leading cadres are honest and 
self-disciplined. Cadres found to have defied instructions and 
violated the circular should be investigated and punished 
strictly and promptly and never be tolerated. 
  Fourth, the more the anticorruption struggle is developed in 
depth, the more we should have a correct and strict command of 
principles and policies. We should always take economic 
construction as the central task and serve better the endeavor 
to promote reform and opening up and accelerate economic 
development. We should adhere to the principle of seeking truth 
from facts, adopt a firm attitude, and do down-to-earth work to 
carry out the anticorruption struggle in a healthy and orderly 
manner. We should soothe popular feeling and further boost the 
enthusiasm of all the people of the municipality through the 
anticorruption struggle. 
  Fifth, we should conscientiously strengthen organizational 
leadership and do a good job in supervision and inspection. 
Tianjin's anticorruption struggle has entered a crucial period, 
and the period before the end of this year is very important to 
determine whether notable results can be achieved. Party 
committees and governments at all levels should attach great 
importance to it and never slacken efforts in the struggle 
despite their busy work. We should conscientiously strengthen 
organizational leadership and apply the responsibility system to 
every level which should be responsible for the work of the next 
lower level. The municipal party committee and government will 
organize an overall inspection in January next year on the 
anticorruption struggle of all units.

  [Excerpts] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee; Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee; and Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal 
party committee and executive vice mayor; went to the Yingbin 
Hall on the afternoon of 19 December to hold a forum with the 
experts, scholars, and delegates from various localities who 
attended the symposium on the scientific, technological, and 
economic development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. 
They studied and probed into the major plans for accelerating 
the economic development of the region. 
  Wu Yongshi, president of the municipal science and 
technology 
association, chaired the forum. 
  Gao Dezhan extended greetings to the delegates before the 
forum started. He said: The symposium held by the science and 
technology associations of various provinces and municipalities 
and Tianjin is a very good opportunity for us to learn from 
others. As Tianjin's work still lags behind others in various 
aspects, we should modestly listen to the opinions of the 
experts and scholars from various localities. 
  At the forum, experts, scholars, and leading comrades from 
other provinces and municipalities aired their views freely and, 
from the perspective of integration of theory with practice, 
offered many constructive theses on the economic advantages and 
development prospects of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea; 
ways of using geographical advantages to strengthen economic 
cooperation and achieve common development; development of 
scientific and technological advantages to create new growing 
points of the economy; and ways of cooperation to open up a new 
situation. The forum proceeded in a vivid, lively, and warm 
atmosphere. [passage omitted] 
  Gao Dezhan listened attentively to the opinions of the 
experts and opinions. He said: The opinions of the experts and 
scholars have greatly inspired me and helped me broaden my 
thoughts. I feel very thankful to the experts and scholars for 
their concern about the development of the coastal region of the 
Bohai Sea and the development of Tianjin. He said: The 
municipal party committee and government attached great 
importance to the symposium on the scientific, technological, 
and economic development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. 
Accelerating the economic development of this region is a 
correct policy made at the 14th party congress after a 
scientific analysis of the overall trend of China's reform, 
opening up, and economic development. We shoulder heavy 
responsibility to turn the region into one of the regions to by 
and large achieve modernization ahead of others. Therefore, we 
should cooperate to achieve common development. We sincerely 
hope that other provinces and municipalities will look for more 
areas where they share common interests in addition to 
accelerating their own development. These areas will be the 
starting points from which the development of the coastal region 
of the Bohai Sea will be accelerated. Cooperation will enhance 
strength and yield efficiency. Through cooperation, we should 
supplement each other with our respective advantages and pursue 
common development. Tianjin has three ideas for the economic 
development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. First, we 
should learn from the opening up and development of Shanghai's 
Pudong new area to accelerate the opening up and development of 
the new coastal areas of Tianjin. Second, Beijing, Tianjin, and 
Hebei should cooperate to build a "Beijing-Tianjin large 
economic ring." Third, we should expand service to facilitate 
the development of the coastal region of the Bohai Sea. To 
accelerate development, Tianjin should provide good service in 
all fields, promote cooperation through the service, achieve 
development through cooperation, learn from other provinces and 
municipalities in the process of service and cooperation, and 
win others' support and assistance in the process of service and 
cooperation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Haikou, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Hainan Province, 
China's largest special economic zone, will accelerate the 
reform of property rights this year to meet the demand of a 
market economy. 
  According to Chi Fulin with the Provincial Office for 
Economic Restructuring, since 1988 when Hainan was designated a 
special economic zone, a market economy has taken shape in line 
with a new social security system. 
  However, the official said, the reform of property rights 
has 
become a pressing need nowadays, and a lot of state enterprises 
are far from efficient. By the end of last year, 30 percent of 
the province's state-run industrial enterprises were operating 
at a loss, while 70 percent of its commercial and trading firms 
did not make profits. 
  The province will place more emphasis on transforming its 
state enterprises into share-holding companies. So far Hainan 
has approved the setting up of 126 share-holding companies with 
total assets of more than 20 billion yuan. 
  The province will also foster the transaction of various 
property rights concerning stocks, patents and fixed assets, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Haikou, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Southern China's 
Hainan Province saw its industrial output value exceed that of 
agriculture last year for the first time in the history of this, 
China's largest special economic zone. 
  Since its establishment as a province more than five years 
ago, Hainan, once a remote and backward region, has gained 
momentum for a sound economic development and improvement of its 
economic structure. 
  The total industrial output of the province in 1993 reached 
9.3 billion yuan-worth, with a growth of about 28.9 percent over 
the previous year. The agricultural output value was 8.4 
billion, an increase of 6.2 percent. 
  Industrial enterprises around the whole province flourished 
last year. The automobile and motorcycle industries recorded 
production increases of 446.7 percent and 460.5 percent, 
respectively. 
  Remarkable growth was also achieved in the beverage, pig 
iron 
and cement industries. 
  Last year the provincial government earmarked 1.5 billion 
yuan for major industrial construction projects in order to lay 
a firm foundation for further development.

  [Excerpts] On 27 December, Governor Tian Chengping and 
Vice Governor Liu Guanghe, together with leaders from the 
provincial government office and the provincial industrial and 
commercial bureau, inspected Huangyuan County. After listening 
to briefings from some of the county leaders on 1993's economic 
work, they went to visit a Chinese-foreign joint-venture 
company. [passage omitted] 
  During this inspection, he talked about future rural work. 
He said: While the planned economy is transforming into a 
market economy, our future rural work should focus on increasing 
peasants' income. The peasants should be encouraged to make 
every possible effort to increase their incomes. There is a 
need to continue to adjust the production structure. In the 
course of grain production, the acreage of crops should be 
expanded. Efforts should be focused on comprehensive 
agricultural development to improve agricultural production 
capacity. In rural areas, township and town enterprises should 
be developed and development projects should be selected in line 
with local conditions. [passage omitted] 
  On how to expedite the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, Governor Tian Chengping said: We should 
concentrate our efforts on studying the actual situation and 
seek the main factors favorable to the formation of markets. 
[passage omitted] 
  He also hoped that all local leaders and relevant 
departments 
would do their best to ensure commodity supplies during the New 
Year and the Spring Festival so that the masses could spend the 
holidays happily and harmoniously.

  [Text] Xining, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Construction of state- 
level large and medium-sized major projects in northwestern 
China's Qinghai Province has promoted the development of local 
economy. 
  Located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province is 
the 
country's largest owner of sylvite and is rich in many other 
mineral resources. 
  To better exploit local resources and improve the investment 
environment, a total of 17 billion yuan has been earmarked by 
the state for the construction of seven major projects in 
Qinghai during the past decade, including the Longyang Gorge 
hydropower station, Qinghai potash fertilizer plant and Golmud 
oil refinery. 
  Completion of the Longyang Gorge hydropower station on the 
upper reaches of the Yellow River has created great profits, 
increasing Qinghai's electricity supply by 1.5 billion kwh [kw 
hours] annually and bringing electricity to most of the rural 
households of the province. 
  The first phase project of the Golmud oil refinery has laid 
a 
firm foundation for the future development of the local petro- 
chemical industry as well as injecting vitality into the whole 
economy of Qinghai. 
  In accord with the mushrooming of large projects, Qinghai 
Province has also developed a host of related industrial 
enterprises and established township enterprises, taking 
advantage of abundant local resources.

  [Text] Xian, January 5 (XINHUA) -- This capital of 
northwest China's Shaanxi Province is attracting more overseas 
investment these days. 
  Up to the end of 1993, this major tourist attraction had 
approved more than 1,000 overseas investment projects, involving 
a total capital of 3.026 billion U.S. dollars. 
  In 1993 alone contracted overseas investment amounted to 
1.17 
billion U.S. dollars, equal to the total in the previous ten 
years, according to official sources. 
  Rich in cultural attractions and located in an advantageous 
position on the middle of the second Euro-Asia Continental 
Railway, the city has witnessed a marked improvement in its 
infrastructure since the mid-1980s, in an effort to boost its 
tourism industry. 
  The city's first expressway, linking it with Lintong, a 
major 
tourism attraction to the east, opened to traffic this year. 
The upgrading of two other highways is also underway. 
  Also completed in 1993 was the Xian International Airport, 
which links it with more than 40 domestic and international 
cities and ranks among the top four airports in China. More 
flights and routes will be opened soon. 
  The city's telecommunications system also saw a big boost, 
with the installation of more than 200,000 digital-controlled 
telephone lines. Direct calls can be made to 800 domestic 
cities and towns and over 180 countries and regions worldwide. 
  The developed infrastructure facilities and powerful 
technology development potential (the city's 503 scientific 
institutions employ 332,000 researchers and technicians) have 
made the city particularly attractive to overseas investment, as 
it has been chosen as the site for a national high- and 
new-technology development zone. 
  The past year has seen three major tendencies emerge in the 
development of overseas investment in the city, according to the 
officials. 
  Manufacturing and urban infrastructure construction have 
become the major targets of foreign investment, in place of 
housing and small-scale trade. Of the new projects approved in 
1993, some 65 percent are in the manufacturing sector, the 
officials said. 
  With the advent of world business giants on the Xian 
investment scene, the volume of investment is becoming larger 
and larger. A Sino-Japanese venture involves an investment of 
30 million U.S. dollars and produces 236,000 industrial sewing 
machines a year. 
  On a visit to Washington D.C. in the U.S. last November, a 
delegation from Xian signed an economic and technological co- 
operation agreement with the city which provided that Washington 
would invest 40 million U.S. dollars to build the "Washington 
Industrial Park" in the Xian High- and New-Technology Zone.

  [Text] Lhasa, January 4 (XINHUA) -- A gala parade of 
elegant floats from dozens of local enterprises on new year's 
day in downtown Lhasa fully demonstrated the determination and 
confidence of the local government and people to expand economic 
reform and actively advance toward the socialist market system 
in 1994. 
  Tibet Autonomous Region is one of the few regions in China 
where a highly centralized planned economy system still holds 
sway, steps of reform are more prudent because of special 
economic conditions. 
  At the end of last year, the local government formally 
called 
on people of the whole region to make a concerted effort to 
deepen reform and to catch up with the pace of the national 
development toward a market economy in 1994. 
  Enterprises in Tibet Autonomous Region used to depend wholly 
on the protective preferential policies of the government for 
their operation and management. 
  Encouraged by the economic boom all over the country, 
enterprises in Tibet decided to actively participate in 
competition and to improve their image, as part of the effort of 
the whole autonomous region to adapt to the national 
construction of a market economy. 
  Many things and words belonging specifically to the market 
economy are no longer strange to people "on the roof of the 
world". 
  A broker training course held by a Sino-U.S. joint venture 
attracted a large number of local young people and the members 
of the first group of about 20-plus futures brokers completed 
their studies at the beginning of the new year. 
  Futures and stocks markets are to be established this year 
for the first time in this land with the highest altitude. 
  Local people have also gradually adapted to the new 
mentality 
of a market economy, during the frequent economic exchanges with 
other parts of the country. 
  More and more people in state-owned enterprises and 
institutions have begun to do business in their spare time in 
the "Sunday market" and the newly-opened "festival market". 
  Modernized commercial facilities have mushroomed in Lhasa 
and 
laid a firm foundation for its commercial prosperity. 
  The government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region attaches 
much 
importance to the implementation of state laws and regulations 
on the establishment of a market economy, including the 
"anti-unfair competition law" and "regulations on protecting 
consumers' interest", in order to create a stable and positive 
environment for the development of the market economy in Tibet.

  [Text] Lhasa, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Tibetans will soon be 
able to experience all the excitement and frustration brought by 
a stock market as Tibet's first stock exchange is expected to 
open in the middle of this month in this capital of the 
autonomous region. 
  President of the Tibetan trust and investment corporation 
Chen Irui said that satellite communications will link the 
Tibetan trading house and the stock exchanges in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen. The computer system in the Lhasa stock exchange is 
already for operation. 
  Entrusted by the autonomous regional government, Chen's 
company is responsible for the establishment of Tibet's first 
stock exchange. Like many other undertakings, the establishment 
of Tibet's stock market also gained support of other regions of 
the country. 
  The company is now the 381st member of the Shanghai stock 
exchange, which has donated a full set of equipment to the 
Tibetan exchange and helped in its installation, Chen said. 
  The Tibetan exchange will also be the first in China to have 
two- way communication links with the Shenzhen stock exchange, 
Chen said. 
  He added that the four-star Tibetan hotel in Chengdu, 
capital 
of Sichuan Province, has applied to be listed. If the 
application is granted, it will be the first shareholding 
company in Tibet. 
  Chen stressed that what matters is not that stocks are 
available to Tibetans, but that Tibet is keeping pace with other 
Chinese regions in establishing a modern banking and investment 
system, and a modern enterprise system. 
  As more Tibetan companies are considering adopting 
shareholding systems, stock trading faces a bright future in 
Tibet, the Chen said.

  [Text] Responsible comrades of the press units directly 
under the province and the press units of the central 
authorities stationed in the province were invited to the 
conference room of the standing committee of the provincial 
party committee on 4 January to attend a forum on press work 
held by the provincial party committee and government. Gu 
Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the 
forum. Responsible comrades of LIAONING RIBAO, the Liaoning 
Provincial Radio and Television Department, the Liaoning 
People's Broadcasting Station, the Liaoning Television Station, 
and the Liaoning Branch of XINHUA News Agency gave speeches. 
They reviewed the achievements and problems of the press units 
of the province and those of the central authorities stationed 
in the province in their efforts to persistently take economic 
construction as the central task and adhere to correct press 
guidance in 1993. They also offered views and suggestions on 
ways to make this year's press and propaganda work successful. 
  Vice Governor Zhang Rongmao spoke to put forward specific 
requirements on how press units should strengthen guidance 
through positive examples and improve the propaganda front. He 
urged press units under party leadership to adhere to the 
principle of propaganda through positive example, correctly 
report the provincial situation, and guide the people throughout 
the province to make contributions to accelerating Liaoning's 
economic construction. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, also 
spoke after attentively listening to the speeches. He said: In 
1993, press units of the province persistently took the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress as guidance and economic 
construction as the central task and carried out a great amount 
of work focusing on the arrangements of the provincial party 
committee and government, thus promoting Liaoning's economic and 
other work. The year 1994 will be one when the largest number 
of China's major reform measures will be executed and also a 
crucial year for the endeavor to more rapidly establish the 
socialist market economy system. Therefore, it is very 
important to do a good job in news reports. 
  He emphasized: The focus of the 1994 press work should be on 
conscientious implementation of the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress, especially those of the third plenary session of the 
14th party Central Committee, and the execution of major reform 
measures should be regarded as an important part of news reports 
to facilitate the establishment of the socialist market economy 
system. Press units should intensify publicity of economic work, 
adhere to the essential criterion of development, and emphasize 
improvement of economic efficiency as the focus to bring about 
healthy, sustained, and rapid development in Liaoning's economy. 
In publicizing the spiritual civilization, they should adhere 
to the major trends to encourage people's enthusiasm for 
building socialism and for plunging themselves into economic 
construction. They should do a good job in publicizing unity 
and stability to provide a good social environment for reform 
and opening up and to ensure the development of economic 
construction and other undertakings. 
  Gu Jinchi also put forward specific demands for improvement 
of the leading bodies and contingents of the press units of the 
province.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter: "Lu Ping Stresses </F>
That It Is a Pity Hong Kong Government Will Not Send Officials 
to Beijing To Give Explanations; Zhang Junsheng Says PWC Will 
Definitely Study Airport Issue"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--The Hong Kong 
Governor had said that he will not send officials to Beijing to 
explain the draft regulations for the Airport Corporation. Lu 
Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said 
that this was too bad. He reaffirmed that the Chinese Government 
sincerely wishes the British Hong Kong Government to cooperate 
with the Chinese side. He said: It shows that the Hong Kong 
Government is not willing to cooperate with us if it does not 
send officials to Beijing. 
  When asked whether or not this action was too politicized, 
Lu 
Ping stressed that it was certainly not politicized, because 
these regulations were not comprehensible to everyone and it was 
absolutely necessary to invite Hong Kong Government officials to 
explain them so that they could answer questions directly raised 
by members of the Preparatory Work Committee [PWC]. 
  Lu Ping did not agree that this practice bypassed the Sino- 
British Airport Committee. He explained: China and Britain 
consult and negotiate with each other on the airport issue 
mainly through the Airport Committee, but before the talks are 
held, the Chinese side has to listen to all kinds of opinions; 
hence, we are asking the PWC to discuss it first, hoping that we 
can listen to all kinds of opinions through the PWC. However, 
questions raised by PWC members cannot even be answered by the 
Chinese side, therefore, we want the British Hong Kong 
authorities would send officials to Beijing to give 
explanations. Regarding the regulations on the airport 
administrative organ, it has been very clearly stated in the 
Memorandum that both sides should consult each other on these 
questions and that the views of the Chinese side should be 
listened to. Hence, in the future, we must still consult with 
the British side through the Airport Committee. 
  Yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, said when attending a forum: As far 
as the consultations on the "draft regulations on the Airport 
Corporation" is concerned, we hope that it is real consultation 
rather than "doing it perfunctorily." As this question, which 
straddles 1997, can be discussed in Hong Kong, why can it not be 
discussed in Beijing? 
  Zhang Junsheng said: Problems straddling 1997 must be 
discussed by the Chinese and the British sides and every 
question related to the new airport should be handled according 
to the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport. The 
issue of the airport corporation has been raised by the British 
side, which must be submitted to China and Britain for 
discussion. In addition, the Chinese side can also publicize 
its suggestions to seek advice from the Hong Kong people. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: Now that the British Hong Kong 
Government has published the "draft regulations on the Airport 
Corporation," I hope that this will be real consultation and 
that they will listen to others' opinions and take these 
opinions into consideration rather than what we describe in the 
mainland as "going through the motions." 
  Responding the issue of the PWC having to study the draft 
and 
invite Hong Kong Government officials to Beijing to brief them 
on the situation, Zhang Junsheng said: These are issues related 
to Hong Kong's transition and issues to be studied by the PWC. 
Under this situation, why can they not invite British Hong Kong 
Government officials to Beijing to explain these regulations? 
  Zhang Junsheng said: Not only the Airport Committee has to 
study the issue, but so does the PWC. It is all for the smooth 
transition of Hong Kong, why can they not do so? I do not know 
what the British Hong Kong Government intends to do regarding 
the smooth transition of Hong Kong? Why cannot we invite them 
to Beijing to have discussions? Why can the issue be discussed 
in Hong Kong but not in Beijing? Why discussions are acceptable 
in Hong Kong but not in Beijing? This is unreasonable. 
  When asked by this reporter why the Chinese side did not 
discuss with the British side the issue of the transition of 
senior Hong Kong civil servants, Zhang Junsheng replied: The 
issue of the transition of senior civil servants has been 
clearly stipulated in the Basic Law, this is China's own 
business as well as the future business of the special 
administrative region government. British will end on 30 June 
1997. This is completely different from the issue of the 
airport corporation which we are now talking about.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhang Junsheng, deputy 
director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, said that the British 
Hong Kong Government is unreasonable for refusing to send an 
official to explain the new airport issue to the Preliminary 
Working Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [HKSAR] Preparatory Committee. 
  The British Hong Kong Government, in the "White Paper on the 
Draft Regulations on the New Airport Corporation" it publicized 
on 3 January, proposes that the current provisional airport 
administrative office be reorganized to become a commercial 
corporation. Because of this, during its third meeting, the 
Economic Subcommittee under the PWC of the HKSAR Preparatory 
Committee requested the British Hong Kong authorities to send an 
official to the PWC to explain the draft regulations on the new 
airport in Hong Kong. But the British Hong Kong Government 
openly rejected the request. Chen-Fang Ansheng, chief secretary 
of the Hong Kong Government, said that there is "no need" for 
the Hong Kong Government to send anyone to Beijing to explain to 
the PWC the draft regulations because "the available channels 
are sufficient." 
  In this connection, Zhang Junsheng indicated that because 
the 
issue of the new airport in Hong Kong is a matter that will 
extend beyond 1997, it should be properly settled by China and 
Britain through consultations. He said that the PWC has the 
responsibility to study matters relevant to Hong Kong's smooth 
transition and that its invitation to Hong Kong Government 
officials to explain the draft regulations is something that 
they should do because it is for the sake of Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. He reiterated that the Chinese Government sincerely 
hopes to cooperate with the British Hong Kong Government.

  [Text] Hong Kong, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China has accused 
the British Hong Kong authorities of lacking sincerity in 
cooperation with the Chinese Mainland by refusing to explain the 
newly- formulated airport bill to Beijing. 
  The mainland's request to invite a Hong Kong Government 
civil 
servant to Beijing to explain the airport management plan was 
advanced at a meeting attended by Chinese officials and 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
  However, the request was immediately turned down by the 
British Hong Kong authorities on an excuse of there is no need 
to establish another channel of communication. 
  Responding to the refusal from the Hong Kong Government, 
Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong branch, said the Hong Kong Government failed to offer any 
convincing argument for the refusal. 
  Construction of the Hong Kong new airport is one of the 
matters stretching the change-over of power in 1997. Therefore 
the draft airport corporation bill should be discussed through 
consultation between the Chinese and British Government, Zhang 
said. 
  The PWC shoulders the responsibility of studying issues 
relating to the smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong. It is 
logical for them to invite an official from the Hong Kong 
Government to explain the airport bill, he added. 
  Zhang stated that the draft airport corporation bill was 
published under the demand of the Chinese side to seek opinions 
from local residents. 
  He said he is expecting that the current invitation of 
public 
opinions would be done in real earnest instead of making a 
gesture.

arrangements for the new airport in what is the strongest sign 
yet it may go it alone on the controversial project. Financial 
Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said yesterday the Legislative 
Council and Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) would be 
briefed shortly on alternative funding arrangements. 
  New ways of funding both the airport and Container Terminal 
9 
(CT-9) would be investigated in consultation with the two 
groups, Macleod said. 
  Britain and China have been deadlocked over the airport 
financing plan for the past two years, resulting in delays which 
will stall Chek Lap Kok's opening date beyond 1997. Macleod 
said legislators and the ACC would be briefed on progress, 
including the latest costs and timing of the airport. He said 
Hong Kong's economy would be damaged if the projects were 
delayed much longer. The delays "cannot go on indefinitely," he 
said. "The broader question is what is the best way ahead. We 
will have to discuss that with the Legislative Council and, of 
course, the consulting committee." 
  Funding the projects with a combination of equity, loans, 
and 
with public money would be looked at "to get the best value for 
money," he said. Macleod stopped short of saying the government 
would take unilateral action but warned that time was running 
out. 
  Britain must consult China on the airport's financing under 
the 1991 Memorandum of Understanding. But the talks have fallen 
victim to the Sino-British political row over Governor Chris 
Patten's constitutional reforms. 
  Macleod said Hong Kong would have more money to spend on 
public works related to the airport because of a budget surplus 
this year. He revealed that his prediction in last year's budget 
that Hong Kong would have a small deficit this year was wrong. 
  His 1994 budget, to be published on 2 March, would show a 
healthy surplus, but the surplus was unlikely to be pumped into 
either the airport or CT-9 projects, he said. 
  "We must not get into the frame of mind that just because we 
have a surplus we have to spend it," he said. He did, however, 
say that other infrastructure projects including the Tinkau 
Bridge which will form part of the link between Kowloon and 
Lantau, were going ahead. The government would call for tenders 
to build the bridge "quite soon", he said. 
  Macleod also revealed that the 1994 budget would include a 
rate capping package to protect people from sharp increases in 
rates as a result of rocketing property values. He also 
welcomed constructive criticism on government proposals to levy 
a 3 percent salary contribution from staff and employers to 
finance the government's old-age pension scheme. Details such 
as the size of the contribution and the payments to pensioners 
could all be looked at again but he stood by the principle, he 
said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "British Side Has No Sincerity in Cooperation </F>
on New Airport"] 
  [Text] On 3 January, the British Hong Kong Government 
released a white paper for consultations on a draft new airport 
ordinance. The consultation papers were released after pressure 
from the Chinese side, for the draft ordinance on the new 
airport has a great bearing not only on the building of the new 
airport, but also on its future management, as well as the 
financial commitments of Hong Kong residents and the interests 
of the Special Administrative Region [SAR]. It has been 
stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 
Memorandum on Hong Kong's New Airport that all major issues 
straddling 1997 should be subjected to consultations and 
discussions with both the Chinese and British sides and should 
not be determined unilaterally by the British side. Therefore, 
after the release of the draft, the British side has a 
responsibility, through appropriate channels, to explain to the 
Chinese side the contents of the draft, the background 
information on detailed arrangements, and the exact definition 
of ordinances, heed the concrete opinions of the Chinese side, 
and make amendments to the draft. 
  The Chinese side has always been worried about whether or 
not 
the British side had the sincerity to implement the "Memorandum 
of Understanding on the Building of Hong Kong's New Airport and 
Related Issues." It is stated clearly in the second paragraph 
of the memorandum: "The airport project should pay attention to 
cost efficiency, and should not become a financial burden to the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic 
of China after 30 June 1997." However, the British side has put 
forward financial arrangements on the construction costs of the 
airport, claiming that "a ceiling should not be set on the 
cost"; as a result, the SAR government will be left with 
"callable equity" of over HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars]. 
This is why an agreement has not been reached on the financial 
arrangement for such a long period of time. 
  In the draft white paper on the airport, is there a 
supervision mechanism which aims to ensure that money will not 
be wasted during construction of the airport, that no one can 
throw away public money like water, and that the franchise will 
not be given to British conglomerates at very low rates and 
conditions? Doubts remains on this issue, because the relevant 
draft has failed to strictly reflect the stipulations of the 
airport memorandum, and also fails to stipulate that all 
contracts and agreements signed by the Airport Authority should 
be submitted to the Airport Affairs Committee of the 
Sino-British Liaison Group for discussion and examination, or to 
the relevant departments of the Hong Kong Government for 
approval and evaluation. As a result, what the Airport 
Authority needs to do is to simply show their accounts to the 
Hong Kong Government once a year. Under such circumstances, no 
administrative departments will know exactly the actual 
operation of the Airport Authority. Such a practice is similar 
to that of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 
where overspending was not supervised by relevant departments of 
the Hong Kong Government and Hong Kong Government auditors had 
no right to check on demand the accounts of the new Airport 
Authority and can only "check accounts on issues entailing 
special concern" upon authorization from the Hong Kong Governor. 
In other words, neither the public nor the Hong Kong Government 
can take immediate preventive or restrictive action, and all 
they can do is cry over spilt milk. 
  The operation of the airport as a whole should reflect the 
idea of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong. Priority should 
be given to Chinese when the chief and principal executives need 
to be recruited. Overseas recruitment will only be considered 
when the talents required cannot be found among Chinese. In the 
past, however, the Provisional Airport Authority appointed 
Richard Allen as chief executive officer. Without any sense of 
responsibility or attachment to Hong Kong, this man overmanned 
the airport authority, spent money extravagantly, and included 
entertainment and holiday spending in his inspection 
expenditures. What is more ridiculous is that he regarded the 
Provisional Airport Authority as his independent kingdom and 
appointed people through favoritism, he invited many of his old 
friends to take well-paid positions and shared the lucre with 
them, and he only recruited staff from overseas and rejected 
participation by locals. By the time it became aware of the 
problem and was forced to end the chaotic and disordered 
situation in the Airport Authority caused by Richard Allen, the 
Government had no alternative but to compensate Richard Allen 
with HK$5 million because his contract was terminated his 
contract with the Government. In addition, the white paper also 
failed to put forward the necessary supervisory procedures on 
personnel recruitment and corporatized personnel management; as 
a result, the president and executive director will be entrusted 
with excessive powers to handle personnel arrangements. The 
general public believe that the principal manager of the new 
airport should be a local. Yueh Kung-nan, the present director 
of Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, is also a Hong Kong 
local, and the Hong Kong people are truly satisfied with the 
current management standards at Kai Tak Airport under his 
leadership. So why is the draft white paper reluctant to draw 
such a stipulation that the principal post at the new airport 
must be filled by a Hong Kong resident? 
  If the British side leaves the SAR government with a new 
airport authority which was set up before 1997 and used to be 
run by people like Richard Allen, the SAR government will find 
itself facing many operational difficulties when it discovers 
numerous problems in this management organ at a later date and 
has to ask the chief executive of the SAR to dismiss and replace 
the organ's staff. 
  It is stated in the airport memorandum: "The British Hong 
Kong Government can exercise leadership over the Airport 
Authority and shoulder responsibility for major policy fields 
before 30 June 1997. The British Hong Kong Government will be 
willing to give consideration to the opinions of the Chinese 
side when drafting the ordinance of the authority," "the British 
Hong Kong Government is willing to appoint Hong Kong-based 
officials from the Bank of China Group as formal members of the 
board of directors of the Airport Authority," and "the British 
Hong Kong Government will notify the Chinese side of its 
proposed appointment of members to the Airport Authority and the 
consultative committee and is willing to heed any opinions of 
Chinese side before a final decision on the appointments are 
made." At present, many clauses in the draft white paper are 
imperfect and vaguely defined. Now that the Preliminary Working 
Committee consists of both Hong Kong people and Chinese 
officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs, we hope that the 
British side can provide the Preliminary Working Committee with 
explanations (for instance, is the Airport Authority defined in 
the memorandum a synonym of the New Airport Corporation) so that 
the Hong Kong people and the Chinese side can acquire a better 
understanding of the draft white paper and can thus offer more 
pertinent opinions. 
  However, Hamish Macleod and Anson Chan Fang On-sang 
yesterday 
flatly rejected a request from the members of the Preliminary 
Working Committee concerning such an explanation. This shows 
that the British side is refusing to cooperate with the Chinese 
side on the building of Hong Kong's new airport and, at the same 
time, is declining to provide Hong Kong people with reasonable 
explanations and data. Their sincerity about soliciting 
opinions is open to question.

  [Text] China plans to invite a Hong Kong civil servant to 
Beijing to explain the airport management plan to the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). This is a 
precedent-setting step involving much more than a principle. 
  The PWC has no legal power in Hong Kong. No civil servant 
should be summoned before such a body. Nor should he or she be 
put in a position where personal loyalty is brought into 
question. There are ample channels for communication between 
the two governments and between PWC members and civil servants 
on an individual basis. It is not as if all the people involved 
are total strangers. 
  That China has chosen this course of action shows several 
things: The depth of the divide between Beijing and London, 
Beijing's determination to exercise some control over the 
territory ahead of 1997 at any cost, and its readiness to 
politicise the civil service. 
  This is not in Hong Kong's interest. It is not just the 
civil service that will suffer. The stability of Hong Kong and, 
ultimately, the life-style of the people will be sacrificed. 
This is not what the return of Hong Kong to China is all about. 
  It would be nice to believe that we could urge the 
administration that a principle is at stake and that giving in 
would be suicidal. The harsh reality is that China will be the 
next sovereign power and the PWC the most influential body here 
long before 1997. 
  Pragmatism and survival dictates that we come to terms with 
this new reality. Either the British make accommodations with 
Beijing on political reforms or work out a way for civil 
servants to meet formally with the PWC in Hong Kong. The 
administration can then keep the initiative while building up 
rapport with the PWC. It is in Hong Kong's interests to have a 
smooth transition. If Beijing and London cannot come to terms 
on political reforms, there is nothing to stop the 
administration from doing whatever it can to keep convergence of 
the civil service on the tracks. 
  Just because Beijing wants to be bull-headed does not mean 
the administration must follow suit. The reverse would go some 
way to dispel the suspicions which have bedevilled Sino-British 
relations for so long. At the same time, Hong kong members of 
the PWC should explain to China that the continued efficiency, 
integrity, and commitment of the civil service is at stake. 
Nothing is worth the impairment or destruction of one of the 
best bureaucracies in Asia. Especially one that can contribute 
so much to China's own future development.

  [Text] The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) will begin 
to discuss Hong Kong's first legislature amid the Sino-British 
row over the territory's political future today. The PWC's 
Government and Administration Group will begin discussions on 
the formation of new district boards and municipal councils 
after 1997. 
  The PWC's Government and Administration Group leader Leung 
Chun- ying said last night, that Hong Kong's post-1997 
administration would only be discussed in principle and it was 
unlikely any concrete proposals would be formed. China would not 
be making a final decision on the structure of Hong Kong's 
future government until the preparatory committee meets in 1996. 
  Earlier, China had reiterated its warning that talks on Hong 
Kong's political future could resume only if Governor Chris 
Patten withdrew his constitutional reform bill from the 
Legislative Council. "The door of the talks is open," Chinese 
Foreign Ministry official Wu Jianmin said. "If the British side 
wants the talks to be restored, it must withdraw that portion of 
the package submitted to the Legislative Council." He said 
China's position on resuming the talks remained unchanged. 
  But Patten has refused to withdraw his partial bill, 
although 
he has not abandoned the possibility of further talks. 
  Patten will meet British Foreign Minister Alistair Goodlad 
today, to discuss his political reform agenda. He will also 
hold crucial talks with Prime Minister John Major and other 
Cabinet ministers in London, later this month, to examine the 
options. It is believed he will table the second phase of his 
package, covering more controversial arrangements for the 1995 
elections, in March if talks do not resume. 
  China has sent official word to London through diplomatic 
channels, that talks will not continue on 29 December [date as 
published]. 
  The political party, Meeting Point have said that Patten 
planned to disclose full details of the 17 rounds of 
unsuccessful Sino- British talks when he tabled the rest of his 
reforms. 
  China has threatened to disband the three-tiers of 
government 
after 1997 unless Patten withdraws his proposals. 
  A group of City Polytechnic students demonstrated on campus 
last night, to protest against the PWC, when officials from 
China's de- facto embassy in Hong Kong arrived for a function. 
The students called for a dissolution of the PWC, saying it was 
not representative of the Hong Kong public.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Pan Hsiao-ping (3382 2556 1627): "Lu </F>
Ping Says That a Lenient Policy Must Be Adopted Toward Former 
Hong Kong Residents Who Intend To Regain Their Right of Abode"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, 
said today that for former permanent residents of Hong Kong to 
regain their right of abode in Hong Kong after losing such a 
right, a more lenient policy should be adopted after 1997. 
Because these people had once obtained permanent resident 
status in Hong Kong, they are different from those newly arrived 
in Hong Kong and applying for the right of abode. He said: 
Furthermore, we welcome persons of ability from various 
countries to Hong Kong, which is an international economic city, 
and we should provide them with some conveniences. 
  Lu Ping answered reporters' questions this morning and 
afternoon on the issue of the status of permanent residents. Lu 
Ping said that the Preliminary Work Committee is studying the 
issue as to what conditions will cause former permanent 
residents of Hong Kong to lose their right of abode and what 
requirements they would have to meet in order to regain their 
right of abode after losing such right. He thought that for the 
former permanent residents of Hong Kong who want to regain their 
right of abode, a more lenient policy should be adopted. Lu 
Ping pointed out: "The issue of nationality and the issue of 
right of abode are two different matters. After 1997, 
foreigners can also obtain the right of abode in Hong Kong as 
well as the status of permanent resident." But Lu Ping added: 
"After non-Chinese nationals obtain permanent resident status, 
if they return to their own countries to live or emigrate to 
other countries then they might lose the status of permanent 
resident of Hong Kong because they have given up Hong Kong as a 
place of permanent residence."

  [Text] China has moved to allay fears that up to 400,000 
Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports will not be able to 
resettle in Hong Kong after 1997. The State Council's Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping said yesterday that 
while it was likely they would retain the right of abode, they 
would lose their Chinese citizenship under China's long-standing 
policy of opposing dual-citizenship. 
  Lu said the issue needed further study in the Sino-British 
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) to protect the residence rights of 
Hong Kong Chinese. "If those people cannot keep their right of 
abode in Hong Kong after obtaining foreign passports, we have to 
study under which circumstances their right of abode can be 
retained," Lu said. "Generally speaking, our policy on this 
issue is flexible and we will try to deal with it flexibly." 
  The Hong Kong government warned yesterday that up to 400,000 
Hong Kong Chinese would not be able to retain their permanent 
residence status under the Basic Law. It also said between 
10,000 and 20,000 non-Chinese, mainly Indians and Pakistanis 
holding British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports, 
would also be denied the right to live here under the Basic Law. 
  Lu said China would try to ensure Chinese citizens born in 
Hong Kong would not need to re-apply for residence if they 
returned. "Such people, when they return to Hong Kong, do not 
need go through any procedure," he said. Non-Chinese who had 
lived in Hong Kong for at least seven years and regarded the 
territory as their permanent residential place would also be 
granted right of abode after 1997, Lu said. But he warned their 
right of abode would be "examined" if they returned to live in 
their mother country. "Such a move means that they do not 
consider Hong Kong their permanent residential place and 
therefore there is no point for them to continue to enjoy the 
right of abode," Lu said. 
  However, it is not yet known whether the seven-year 
criterion 
should apply to Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports. Rita 
Fan, leader of the Social Order Group of the Preliminary Working 
Committee, also said Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports 
would retain the right of abode after China took over. She said 
the important thing was to define the conditions listed under 
Article 24 of the Basic Law. 
  The PWC Social Order Group will meet in Beijing next week to 
study this issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Fanny Wong] </F>
  [Text] This financial year is starting to look like its 
predecessor, with Hong Kong heading for a huge budget surplus as 
income from property transactions and booming stock markets 
continues to flood the Treasury. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish 
Macleod declined to say what the figure might be, but he did not 
rule out that it could be close to the $20 billion suggested 
earlier by a senior official. 
  The healthy financial position is set to benefit the 
construction of infrastructure projects, including the Chek Lap 
Kok Airport, as Sir Hamish conceded that higher reserves 
afforded the Government more choices in funding of public works 
plans. Sir Hamish for the first time said there would 
definitely be a surplus this year instead of the $3.36 billion 
deficit he projected in his March Budget speech. "There is 
going to be a surplus but I am not embarrassed by that. I am 
only embarrassed if we seriously underspend on public works," he 
said. Underspending by about $6 billion that occurred the 
previous financial year was unlikely to be repeated. 
  Based on share transactions volume, the government income 
from the stock market is expected to be several billions bigger 
than the $9 billion forecast in March. Sir Hamish noted that 
mortgage lending by the banks had grown by about 15 percent, 
while property prices rose by 20 percent. But he stressed that 
the Government would continue the guideline of keeping the 
growth of public expenditure in line with the growth of the 
economy. "I don't think we should get too much in the frame of 
mind that simply because we have a surplus we can, or should, 
spend it," Sir Hamish said. 
  Hong Kong finished with a $22 billion surplus for the last 
financial year and the expectation of another this year has 
prompted suggestions that the territory can afford to pump much 
more money into the airport plan than the $16.6 billion capital 
injection envisaged in the first financial package. 
  But the Financial Secretary said affordability was a 
separate 
question from how much money was desirable to pump into the 
project. "I can't deny that if the reserves are better, we have 
more choices--whether it is to build other infrastructure 
projects or pump more money into the airport or anything else. 
It's just a statement of fact," he said.

  [Text] Lanzhou, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China has completed a 
new snow-monitoring system for pastoral areas. 
  The satellite monitoring system can forecast the possibility 
of disastrous snowstorms and estimate the damage that can 
result, through remote sensing techniques, over a vast pastoral 
area from western China's Tibet-Qinghai Plateau to the Greater 
Hinggan Mountains in northeast China. 
  Snow disasters cause heavy losses to livestock in northern 
China every year, sometimes as much as five percent of the total. 
  Scientists from the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and 
Cryopedology in northwest China's Gansu Province prepared the 
data for the satellite monitoring covering an area of about 
590,000 sq [square] km.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 7 (XINHUA) -- A multi-blade drill 
bit invented 40 years ago by Ni Zhifu, now 61-year-old 
vice-chairman of the National People's Congress of China, is now 
being made more accurately by a computer-controlled machine. 
  Tianjin University recently developed the high-tech machine 
tool to make the bit, after decades in which this sophisticated 
cutter had been hand-made. 
  The machine tool developed by the university in north 
China's 
Tianjin city is among the most advanced ones in the world. It 
can make a bit that has different irregularly shaped blades. 
  According to a university official, the highly efficient bit 
has been widely used in machine-making industry in the world. 
  Ni was then elected a model worker because of his invention, 
and later became the head of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions (ACFTU). 
  The official said that though the bit has been updated with 
different models in the past decades, the fact that it had to be 
hand-made caused problems in assuring uniform standards of 
quality. 
  The newly developed automatic machine tool has solved the 
problem. It uses a computer to control the making of bits.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make Concerted Efforts, Work Hard, and Clear </F>
the Way To Forge Ahead"] 
  [Text] With the clear sound of the new year bell, we usher 
in a promising 1994. At this time, when the whole world is 
joined in celebration, we want to convey new year greetings and 
wishes to our combat comrades in the Navy, Army, and Air Force 
who are fighting on every front for the motherland; to Armed 
Police officers and men; to militiamen and reserve personnel on 
various fronts; to retired and resigned old comrades who have 
racked their brains in building our Armed Forces; to demobilized 
servicemen, disabled servicemen, and family members of martyrs 
and servicemen; and to people's governments at various levels 
and the people of various nationalities who have shown care and 
support for national defense building and the building of the 
People's Armed Forces! 
  The year 1993, which has just passed, has added a colorful 
page to the history of the invigoration of the Chinese nation. 
This was a year in which we profoundly implemented the spirit 
of the 14th party congress, used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the 
whole party and Army, and rapidly developed the undertakings of 
reform, opening up, and modernization. It was a very important 
year, in which we built the socialist market economy system 
based on the action plan which was formulated by the CPC Central 
Committee for marching towards the new century. It was a year 
in which our country witnessed economic development, political 
stability, national unity, social progress, and great vitality 
in various areas. During the year, the People's Armed Forces 
advanced together with the people of various nationalities in 
the whole country, and overall army building scored new results. 
Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the 
Central Military Commission, of which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the 
core, the whole Army diligently grasped military quality 
building, followed the road of crack troops with Chinese 
characteristics, and scored outstanding results in various areas 
of work. We implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress 
and voluntarily used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of the 
officers and men of the whole Army. This completely strengthened 
enthusiasm and resolution to uphold the party's basic line and 
guaranteed a correct direction for the reform and building of 
our Army. We inherited and developed our Army's excellent 
traditions, vigorously stepped up and improved ideological and 
political work under the new situation, and further promoted the 
"five kinds of revolutionary spirit" proposed by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the "64-character pioneering spirit" advocated by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin. With the military strategy for the new 
period as guidance, we established our thinking on winning 
battles on the basis of currently available equipment, while new 
enthusiasm for training emerged in every Army unit. We adapted 
to the new situation of development of the socialist market 
economy, continuously deepened reform of logistics work, and 
enabled logistics and supply ability to improve markedly. At the 
same time, science and technology for national defense made new 
progress, educational reform in military academies started at a 
new pace, reserve strength continuously increased, and militia 
and reserve work made new progress. To conclude, meeting the 
requirements of "being politically qualified, being militarily 
capable, having a good work style, strict discipline, and 
effective logistics," our Army's various tasks, aimed at the 
main goal of building a modernized and regular revolutionary 
army, made another solid step in the past year. 
  We are facing a new international situation in which peace 
and development became the two main themes in the world and 
challenges and opportunities coexist, as well as a new domestic 
situation in which economic construction has become the center 
of various tasks, and reform and opening up is being thoroughly 
implemented. Our Army's duties are arduous and difficult, and 
the responsibilities are glorious and heavy. In the new year, 
we must continue to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army 
building in the new period and the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guidance and base 
ourselves on our military strategy for the new period to further 
implement the policy of paying attention to quality building, 
strengthen ideological and political building, firmly grasp the 
implementation of various tasks centering on military training, 
thoroughly improve our combat ability, and provide strong and 
forceful security guarantees for the country's reform, opening 
up, and modernization construction. We must continue to 
resolutely use the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to arm the whole Army, earnestly put the study 
of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping to 
the primary position when engaging in ideological and political 
building in the Army and giving theoretical education to cadres. 
We must use the fruits of the study to guide and promote the 
building and reform of Army units. We must strengthen the 
building of the cadres contingent -- especially leading groups 
at various levels; implement the "Outline on Army Building at 
the Grass-Roots Levels" reissued by the Central Military 
Commission; promote party work style building, clean government 
building, and socialist spiritual civilization building; 
strengthen and improve ideological and political work under the 
conditions of the development of the socialist market economy; 
ensure that at any time and under any condition, the Army 
voluntarily maintains a high degree of political and ideological 
conformity with the CPC Central Committee; and maintain the 
Army's high degree of stability and unity. Based on the demands 
of military strategy in the new period, we must upgrade combat 
ability under modern conditions -- especially high-tech 
conditions; continue to deepen reform of military training, 
grasp technical and tactical training, and ceaselessly improve 
coordinated combat capability, quick response capability, 
electronic warfare capability, combat survival in the 
wilderness, and comprehensive logistic ability. We must adapt 
to the new situation the socialist market economy, continuously 
strengthen the building and reform of logistics, vigorously 
develop farm and sideline production, and diligently improve the 
Army's material and cultural conditions. It is necessary to 
expedite the development of science and technology for national 
defense. Management of Army units, educational reform in 
military academies, and logistic building must make new headway 
in the new year. To conclude, under the main theme of 
implementing the military strategy for the new period, our 
Army's various tasks should make great achievements. 
  The goals have now been fixed, the principles have now been 
set, and the crucial work now is to grasp implementation. Not 
to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all, and not to grasp solidly 
is also not to grasp at all. Whether the decisions of the CPC 
Central Committee and the Central Military Commission can be 
enforced, whether the military strategy for the new period can 
be carried out, and whether reform and building of the Army can 
scale new heights, all depends on implementation. Emancipating 
the minds and seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, as well as the precondition and crux 
for us to grasp work well. We must always observe this 
ideological line, proceed from reality when doing every task, 
straighten out the guiding thoughts for our work, and examine 
the very work by the criterion of judging whether it is 
conducive to increasing the Army's combat ability; and we must 
really be able to be responsible to the party, the people, and 
the long-term building of the Army. Grasping implementation is 
an arduous task, which requires strong revolutionary ambition 
and a sense of responsibility. Our cadres at various levels 
must always think of the undertakings of the party and the 
people; discharge their duties honestly; be responsible, work 
hard and not be upset by criticism; and make selfless 
contributions. They must run the Army strictly, set strict 
demands, carry out strict training, and practice strict 
management. They must establish honest and pragmatic leadership 
work styles, do practical things, speak the truth, report the 
actual situation, resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and 
superficial style, always view the grass-roots level and build 
the foundation as the core of work. They must voluntarily serve 
the grass-roots levels, and really be able to meet the demand 
which has recently been raised repeatedly by Chairman Jiang of 
the Central Military Commission: "Spend more time on learning, 
spend less time on social intercourse, do more research and 
investigation, be less subjective do more practical things, and 
speak less empty words." 
  The new century is walking towards us. We must, under the 
leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission of which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the core, work 
together with one heart, struggle arduously, clear the way to 
forge ahead, successfully fulfill the glorious duties given to 
the Army by the party and the people, and usher in a bright 
future with new victories.

World Military Situation"] 
  [Text] With the end of Cold War, the world's 
military situation is experiencing profound changes. The main 
trend is a continuation of developments toward relaxation. 
The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted in a thorough 
disintegration of the bipolar structure centered on U.S.-Soviet 
confrontation. Although we still cannot say that military 
confrontation between the United States and Russia has 
disappeared, the degree of tension and acuteness has been 
greatly decreased. The major countries of the world have 
shifted their attention to economic development and increasing 
their comprehensive national strength. Meanwhile, they are also 
readjusting their respective military strategies. According to 
information from Western research institutions, the world's 
military expenditures fell by 15 percent in 1992 (the main 
reason is that Russia and other CIS states, as well as the 
European countries, have reduced their military expenditure by a 
big margin). This is the first big reduction since the end of 
World War II. Troop numbers in the various major countries have 
also been reduced. At the same time, the pace of arms control 
talks has been accelerated. At the beginning of this year, the 
United States and Russia concluded a second stage of talks on 
reducing strategic nuclear weapons. They agreed that both sides 
would retain 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads each by 
the year 2003, which means a two-thirds reduction in existing 
nuclear weapons. An agreement has finally been reached on 
banning chemical weapons and a convention on banning the 
production, research, and use of chemical weapons and thoroughly 
destroying existing chemical weapons has been signed. There is 
also declining trend in the arms trade. In 1992, the volume of 
arms delivered fell by 25 percent. Judging from the regional 
situation, regional conflicts and limited wars, which were 
affected by the contention between the two superpowers in the 
past, have been scaled down. Many of them have been resolved 
through political channels. 
  In short, the danger of world war and the possibility 
of face- to-face confrontations between the big powers has been 
further reduced. Relaxation is the main trend of development in 
the current world military situation, and this trend is likely 
to be preserved in the future. 
  However, on the other hand, as the post-cold war world is 
entering a period of the establishment of a new international 
strategic pattern, various forces are undergoing a process of 
breaking up and reorganization. Factors of instability and 
uncertainty in the world military situation have also increased. 
Looking at the present and for a period to come, the 
following characteristics merit our attention: 
  1. All of the world's major countries are carrying out 
readjustments of their military strategies in order to suit the 
new situation after the Cold War. Although they have different 
emphases, a common trend is to change from making preparations 
for large-scale wars to dealing with regional conflicts, and 
from mainly dealing with practical military threats to mainly 
dealing with potential threats. This can be seen from 
their army building policies. They are all reducing troop 
numbers while increasing force quality, and they are carrying 
out reforms of the organizational establishment of their army 
units, force structures, and command systems. They are all 
trying to establish small but highly trained and highly mobile 
military forces, while attaching special importance to 
strengthening their navies and air forces. What merit our 
attention is that the development of science and technology will 
continue to play an enormous role in propelling the development 
of military forces in the future. Revolutionary changes will 
possibly take place in the development of military equipment or 
in types of war. This was seen especially clearly during 
the Gulf War. Now, while reducing forces and eliminating 
obsolete equipment, various countries are concentrating their 
strength on developing conventional high-tech weaponry and 
equipment. For this reason, military expenditure on scientific 
research is increasing in many countries. Moreover, combat 
theories and techniques have also been developed. A general 
trend is to stress combined arms on a larger scale and in larger 
areas. Some traditional combat theories and techniques are 
already outdated. In short, under condition where various 
countries are reducing their forces, competition among them 
regarding the quality of their military strength has begun 
quietly. 
  2. The disintegration of the bipolar structure has led 
to a serious imbalance in military strength throughout the world 
and the trend of U.S. military intervention has further 
developed. For a period to come, the United States will 
continue to hold a dominant position in international military 
affairs. Although Russia is still powerful in terms of military 
strength, it is difficult for it to continue to maintain 
military confrontation with the United States like the former 
Soviet Union. The United States has become the only superpower 
in the military sphere, capable of using military force on a 
large scale in the world. This will be an important factor 
affecting the military situation. At present, the United States 
is resolved to "maintain a leading position in the world." 
While appropriately reducing the scale of its military 
deployment, it is doing its best to preserve its military 
presence throughout the world. At the same time, it is trying 
hard to establish a new military pattern in various regions on 
the basis of the security structures of the Cold War period, 
with itself at the core. The United States' dominant position 
is also reflected by the increasing trend of intervention in the 
affairs of other countries through its military policy. 
  Meanwhile, the trend of multipolarization has also 
developed in the military sphere. Over the past few years, 
when taking military action abroad, the United States has had to 
seek assistance and support from its allies or make use of the 
banner of the United Nations. This shows that although it is 
powerful in terms of strength, its ability still falls short of 
its wishes, and there are many restrictions. In particular, the 
rise of Germany and Japan in the economic field could possibly 
intensify centrifugal forces among the Western countries, which 
could finally become a new challenge to the United States. 
Russia, which is in the midst of deep economic and political 
crises, is still declaring its wish to preserve its position as 
a major world power. While reducing its military forces by a 
big margin, it has preserved a plan to modernize its strategic 
nuclear forces. Moreover, the vast numbers of large, medium, 
and small countries also form a latent force that cannot be 
neglected. In recent years, they have made positive efforts to 
promote regional military cooperation in order to resist 
intervention by foreign forces. Although for a short period to 
come there will be no fundamental changes in contests of 
military strength throughout the world, judging from a long-term 
point of view, this will be an important factor promoting the 
development of multipolarization in the world's military 
situation. 
  3. With the end of Cold War, important changes have 
taken place in the security concepts of many countries and the 
role of economic factors in international affairs is 
increasing. As various countries have shifted the focus of 
their attention to domestic economic construction and have 
become increasingly interdependent in the economic field, they 
more frequently consider interstate relations from the angle of 
economic interest. In their security policies, almost all 
countries take security in economic affairs as their main 
objective, while submitting military construction to the needs 
of economic construction. 
  However, the rise of economic factors does not mean the role 
of military power in international affairs is not important. 
First, the role of military power is still considered seriously 
by various countries, especially the major powers. In 
consideration of their economic interests, some countries have 
attached greater importance to the protection of offshore 
resources and trade routes. After achieving successful 
development in the economic field, they have accelerated the 
pace of arms development. Some countries in the Asia-Pacific 
region and some Arab countries in the Middle East countries have 
been increasing their military expenditure over the past few 
years. 
  Second, amid economic competition, nationalist sentiments 
are 
also growing. As a result, some countries have attached greater 
importance to bolstering their military strength in an attempt 
to make up for their inadequate economic strength and use this 
as an important means to protect their interests. 
  Lastly, various big Western powers still regard military 
strength as a deterrent force and means of attack to deal with 
so-called "threats" from the Third World. Their gigantic 
military industries cannot be effectively converted to civilian 
production on a large scale now. As a matter of fact, these 
countries still maintain very high military expenditures. 
  4. With the further reduction in the danger of world 
war, regional armed conflicts and limited wars will become the 
main form of military conflict. Since the drastic changes 
in the East European countries in 1989 and the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union, a number of regional conflicts have taken 
place in the Balkan region along the borders of southern Europe, 
which extend northwards to the former Soviet Union, forming a 
new hot spot of instability. However, in general, the world 
situation is developing toward relaxation, and regional 
conflicts have also been restricted to a certain extent. 
Generally, there situation is changeable, sometimes tense, 
sometimes relaxed. Although some big powers have interfered in 
or had a hand in regional conflicts, they have not sparked 
military confrontation between the big powers. 
  Nevertheless, we cannot conclude from this that the danger 
of 
regional armed conflict and limited wars is not important. In 
various regions of the world, potential hot spots exist, which 
could lead to the involvement of major powers and regional 
powers in direct military confrontation. In its new "regional 
defense strategy," the United States proposes that "two limited 
wars should be won simultaneously." It is also making earnest 
preparations for undertaking combat operations when necessary. 
Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of sudden 
incidents occurring.

  [Text] The enlarged meeting of the provincial people's air 
defense committee was held in Jinan on 5 January. This meeting 
is primarily devoted to summarizing experiences, defining tasks, 
and further emancipating the mind and deepening reform with a 
view to pushing the province's people's air defense work onto a 
new level. Attending the meeting were Zhao Zhihao, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee, governor of the 
province, and chairman of the people's air defense committee of 
the province; Zhang Taiheng, commander of the Jinan Military 
Region and chairman of the people's air defense committee of the 
region; Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of the province and vice 
chairman of the people's air defense committee of the province; 
Gao Zhongxing, deputy chief of staff of the Jinan Military 
Region; Yi Yuanqiu, commander of the provincial military 
district and vice chairman of the people's air defense committee 
of the province; and Liu Chaoming, deputy director of the 
General Office of the State People's Air Defense Committee. 
  Governor Zhao Zhihao and Commander Zhang Taiheng placed 
expectations and set demands on the province's air defense work. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The building up of the people's air 
defense facilities is an important content to enhance the 
comprehensive national strength. Secretary Jiang Chunyun has 
demanded that the province should march in the forefront of the 
country in building the people's air defense facilities. The 
provincial government has also defined goals for this work. To 
fulfill the goals, we are faced with an extremely arduous task. 
By conscientiously implementing and protractedly persisting in 
the principles of combining the peacetime needs with the wartime 
preparedness and working out plans for all fields, with focus on 
construction, all levels of governments and air defense 
committees must strive to enhance the overall defending ability 
and the ability of self-development and self-improvement. 
  In his speech, Zhang Taiheng fully affirmed people's air 
defense work of Shandong Province. He pointed out: The 
building up of the people's air defense facilities is a task of 
fundamental importance to the fulfillment of our great 
long-range cause and is directly related to the security and 
interests of the state. To achieve success in the reform and 
building up of the people's air defense work, we must make great 
efforts to suit the need of the high technology war, the need of 
economic construction, and the need of urban construction. We 
should also make great efforts to enable the people's air 
defense facilities to truly play the dual functions of 
facilitating economic construction and social development in 
peacetime and facilitating air defense in wartime. In addition, 
we should put the people's air defense work in a due social 
position to ensure its long-range and steady development. 
  (Cheng Junting), director of the general office under the 
provincial people's air defense committee, made a work report at 
the meeting, entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Seize the 
Opportunity, and Further Accelerate the Reform and Development 
the Province's Air Defense Work."

living standards. 
  The lowest wage for each municipality or province will be 
determined after consultation with the local governments trade 
unions and businesses, according to rules recently issued by the 
Ministry of Labour which has been drafting the regulations for 
18 months. 
  The minimum wage will not be less than half the local 
average 
wage scale, according to the instructions. 
  Shanghai has set the city's minimum monthly wage at 210 yuan 
($24) while Shenzhen and Zhuhai, the two economic special zones 
in South China's Guangdong Province, have set minimum wages at 
280 yuan ($32) and 326 yuan ($38), respectively. 
  Beijing and the other provinces are still deliberating their 
own standards, said an official from the Labour Ministry, which 
is supervising the nationwide minimum-wage system. 
  All the provinces and municipalities must establish their 
minimum wage before July this year, the official said. 
  Provincial labour departments will implement wage systems in 
their areas, especially for enterprises that have been empowered 
to decide their own wages, according to a State policy 
introduced in July, 1992. 
  The minimum wage aims to guarantee a reasonable standard of 
living for employees at a time when the gap is widening between 
different groups of people as a result of intensifying 
competition for jobs, the official said. 
  A critical target is low-wage earners, who have been 
affected 
by rising prices in a period of economic growth he added. 
  Though cheap labour helps to lure foreign and overseas 
investments that create employment opportunities, the new system 
will ensure that workers are treated fairly in overseas-funded 
enterprises that sometimes neglect the welfare and safety of 
their labourers, the official added. According to the 
Beijing-based China Ocean News, a joint venture in Fujian 
Province has forced its workers to work 16 hours and 
occasionally 18 hours a day. 
  An overseas-funded toy factory in Zhuhai City of Guangdong 
Province owes more than 1.6 million yuan ($183,000) in back 
salaries for the period between 1989 to 1991, the newspaper said. 
  The same conditions exist in some State-owned enterprises 
that have been contracted to individual managers. 
  Without a minimum wage mandate, it is difficult to mobilize 
employees to be more productive or increase enterprise 
efficiency, said Su Hainan, an official from the Ministry of 
Labour. 
  "It will be in the interest of a huge number of urban 
labourers, who used to be ill-paid," Su said. "On the other 
hand, workers will get a powerful weapon to protect themselves." 
  The minimum-wage system is a symbol that China plans to 
adopt 
international practices, said Su. 
  The enterprises that embezzle or delay paying workers' wages 
will be penalized according to the regulations, the official 
said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China is embarking on 
a trial reform of the wage system in 100 state-owned enterprises 
this year which will enable them to decide on their own staff's 
wages. 
  Meanwhile, in foreign-funded or privately-owned enterprises, 
the state will advocate a system of setting wage levels through 
collective negotiation or consultation. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, a high-ranking official with 
the 
state's Ministry of Labor said that the reform will focus on 
readjusting staff income structures in large and medium-sized 
enterprises with state ownership. 
  The reform will channel numerous employee subsidies and 
allowances, including housing subsidies, into their salaries. 
And the enterprises will be granted full decision-making powers 
in setting or increasing wages for their employees on the 
prerequisite that their wage increase rates do not exceed a rate 
representing economic efficiency. 
  According to the official, the enterprises chosen for trial 
wage reform will determine for themselves the number of 
employees needed, and managerial personnel in the enterprises 
will be salaried yearly under the system. 
  Along with the wage reform measures, the state will regulate 
and guide social distribution by setting minimum wage levels or 
issuing guidelines on wage increases. 
  The official noted that the present wage reform will also 
take into consideration the wage readjustment being conducted in 
government organizations or institutions. He said that wage 
increases in the enterprises should be made in light of economic 
efficiency and the cost of living index. 
  Meanwhile, the reform will also try to smooth out wage 
relations between enterprises and government institutions and 
between in- service staff and retired personnel.

  [Text] Shanghai, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Baoshan Steel Group Inc., 
one of China's biggest state-owned steel conglomerates, has 
begun moves to raise capital by issuing shares through a stock 
market listing. 
  But the authorities in Beijing, flooded with such 
applications, are putting the brake on allowing firms to convert 
to limited liability status, as more than one-third of them are 
running at a loss. 
  "To do so, we have to carry out many structural reforms. But 
the work is well in progress," said Wang Pei Zhou, president of 
the steel giant. 
  A reform plan, adopted by the Communist Party Central 
Committee in November, requires state enterprises like Baoshan 
Steel to come up with "corporate systems." 
  The changes include reassessment of fixed assets, adoption 
of 
Western-style accounting methods, and separation of welfare 
facilities like schools from the parent company. In particular, 
such welfare facilities are a great burden on state enterprises. 
  "The separation is a necessary step to improve our business 
performance," Wang said in an interview at a luxury hotel 
operated by the steel firm. 
  The company's "living quarters," including hotels, schools, 
hospitals, shopping centers, a big gymnasium and apartment 
buildings for 23,200 employees, accounts for about one-fifth of 
the 13 square kilometers covered by the complex, which faces the 
Chang Jiang River. 
  Even with these burdens, the 15-year-old steel company 
posted 
a pretax profit of 570 million yuan on sales of 18 billion yuan 
last year, paying a total of 3 billion yuan to state coffers as 
of December, 1993. 
  Under share-listing guidelines, candidate companies must 
meet 
five conditions, according to Wang Hui Zhong, assistant 
researcher at the Shanghai Securities Exchange. These are 
registered capital of 50 million yuan or more, public offering 
of 25 percent of issued shares, profits for three successive 
years, approval by its "board of directors," and recommendations 
by two stock exchange members. 
  The stock exchange saw a total of 20 company listings last 
year with 101 "A" shares for Chinese residents and 19 "B" issues 
reserved exclusively for overseas investors, Wang said. 
  This month, 15 companies, including Maanshan Iron and Steel, 
are being listed on the local bourse. "Surely, there are no 
problems of efficiency and creditworthiness," boasted Wang. "A 
public listing, domestic and overseas, depends wholly on the 
government's decision." 
  Baoshan last month started building a plant for 1,580 mm 
hot- 
rolled band steel, the key element in a third-phase project that 
also calls for construction of a blast furnace, two cold-rolled 
steel mills and a plant to make silicon steel. 
  Under the plan, the steelmaker's present output capacity of 
6.5 million tons per annum will be raised to eight million tons 
by 1997 with a final goal of 11 million tons in 1998, the 
president said. 
  Zho Ya Long, an official with Shanghai Wan Guo Securities 
Co., however, said, "listing of Baoshan is unlikely, while that 
of the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Iron and Steel Works, which 
has applied to the central government for permission for the 
fund-raising, will take place in the near future." 
  "The Shanghai No. 3 works needs capital to raise production 
of heavy steel plates for fast-growing domestic shipbuilders. 
Shanghai municipal government has already given the green light 
to the plan." 
  Meanwhile, Beijing is curbing listing of big state companies 
such as Baoshan for fear that an excess of new issues would 
spoil the fledgling stock market, the local securities firm 
official says. 
  "Fund-raising through the stock market has helped us upgrade 
technology by using money for active capital spending," said 
Rong Jia Xiao, manager of comprehensive management department at 
Shanghai Erfangji Co., which floated its first A and B shares in 
1992. 
  China's top spinning machine maker, which became the first 
mainland-listed company to obtain American depository receipt 
approval in December, had to transform its management mechanism 
into a stock company for a tough survival race in the domestic 
and world markets, Rong said. 
  "The management reforms began in mid-1980s, when all the 
rights were controlled by the state. Promotion of workers had 
been decided on by the local government," he recalls. 
  The Shanghai-based firm, with 5,500 workers, used money from 
issuing a shares for investment in building a 
computer-controlled design and production system last year, rong 
said. 
  Shanghai Erfangji raised one-third of the capital and 
investment money it needed on the stock markets and borrowed the 
remainder from Chinese banks last year. 
  "Management places a high priority on returns of profits to 
shareholders. A dividend of 0.04 yuan is scheduled for the 
business year, which ended on December 31," he said. 
  The government still owns 46 percent of the textile 
machinery 
firm's outstanding shares, followed by overseas investors' 41 
percent and domestic individual investors' 11 percent, according 
to a midterm financial report. 
  Rong said, "domestic investors are very speculative, but 
foreign investors into B shares are mature and stable. Removing 
a wall between A and B shares is welcome, as it will lead to 
further inflows of foreign investors' money to the domestic 
stock markets." 
  In response to a question about insufficient disclosure 
systems in China, Rong insists, "bank officials are permanently 
stationed at our office to keep a close eye on how much we pay 
in salaries to employees, and certified public accountants check 
our records."

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 6 (CNS)--There has been a wave 
of shopping using foreign exchange certificates (FECs) in 
Guangzhou as residents try to use them for purchases in view of 
the unification of the exchange rate of the renminbi and the 
halt to the issuance of FECs effective early this year. The 
situation is now returning to normal following a government 
notice to bring an end to the chaos. 
  With a circular setting out a restructuring of the foreign 
exchange system on December 30, last year, shopping malls here 
where FECs circulated were crowded with shoppers. The 
Friendship Store took in more than one million FEC on one day, 
amounting to much more than the usual daily takings of 100,000 
FEC. A handful of shoppers used FECs to buy household 
electrical appliances while most people spent their certificates 
on daily necessities and food. Stores adjusted the exchange 
rate between the renminbi and the FEC on their own because they 
did not know how else to solve the problem, leading to 
disturbances by FEC-holders. The People's Bank of China in 
response issued a special notice to clear up doubts regarding 
circulation of FECs and how they were to be cleared in 
accordance with the official exchange rate posted on December 
31, 1993. The issuing of this notice helped ease the chaos to a 
great extent. 
  Shoppers using FECs are now becoming increasingly fewer in 
number. Some foreign-funded hotels here stopped accepting FECs 
on January 1.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Council has 
decided to suitably lower customs duties on imported small 
automobiles effective 1 January 1994, as well as adjust policies 
on tariff reductions or exemptions for imported small 
automobiles. Replying to questions from a XINHUA NEWS AGENCY 
reporter, a spokesman of the General Administration of Customs 
said: The decrease in customs duties and the adjustment of 
tariff reduction policies covers sedans, station wagons, jeeps, 
vans, and pickup trucks. The tariff reductions for small 
automobiles include: for vehicles with gasoline and diesel 
engines smaller than three liters and 2.5 liters respectively, 
customs duties are lowered from 180 percent to 110 percent; for 
vehicles with gasoline engines and diesel engines larger than 
three liters and 2.5 liters respectively, customs duties are 
lowered from 220 percent to 150 percent. The tariff reduction 
margins of 38.8 percent and 31.8 percent [as received] 
respectively are very large. 
  The spokesman added: Apart from tax exemptions for 
organizations and personnel -- such as diplomatic organizations 
and diplomats stationed in China, including UN organizations and 
its personnel -- which enjoy tariff reductions because of our 
participation in international treaties or specifications in 
agreements signed between our government and governments of 
other countries, as well as small automobiles entirely donated 
by international organizations and foreign governments, customs 
duties, import value-added taxes, and other taxes shall be 
collected by customs without exception for small automobiles 
imported by any other organizations and personnel. The current 
customs duties for our country's imported small vehicles are 
rather high. The tariff is 220 percent for small vehicles with 
a capacity larger than 2.5 liters, and 180 percent for those 
smaller than 2.5 liters. If the import value-added tax (14 
percent) and vehicle purchase surtax are added, the total duties 
for importing a completely assembled vehicle will exceed 300 
percent. Consumers can afford to pay for vehicles, but not the 
taxes. On the other hand, the excessive number of policies on 
tariff reduction has seriously weakened the functions of 
macroeconomic control of customs duties, which is unfavorable to 
controlling the import of small automobiles and unsuitable for 
the requirement of the socialist market economic system. 
Meanwhile, it encourages smuggling and tax evasion in small 
vehicle imports. The State Council's decision to reduce customs 
duties for imported small automobiles and to abolish the 
excessive number of policies on tariff reduction or exemption is 
to create conditions for fair competition and to cut tariff 
burdens, a measure favorable to promoting the development of our 
automobile industry and improving our investment environment.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jan (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhongyu, minister 
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, today 
urged localities to correctly understand the great significance 
of reform of the taxation system; and to properly effect the 
convergence and transition from the old to the new taxation 
system so that enterprises can quickly meet the requirements of 
new circumstances and compete in the market on equal terms. 
  Wang Zhongyu said: Much of the current taxation system 
reform contents are entirely new. Some enterprises are 
unfamiliar with the specific contents and basic guidelines of 
the reform. Therefore, the first thing for them to do is 
earnestly study the fundamental guidelines of the taxation 
system reform and have a good grasp of its specific contents. 
Meanwhile, it is also necessary for the broad masses of staff 
and workers to understand the following points: 
  -- The current taxation system reform will not increase 
enterprises' overall tax burdens. The reform has a direct 
impact on the interests of the vast number of enterprises, and 
their staff and workers. The program to reform the taxation 
system embodies the principle -- stressed repeatedly by leading 
comrades of the State Council -- of not increasing enterprises' 
overall tax burdens. According to a general survey of the 
Ministry of Finance, the average burden of turnover tax for 
industrial enterprises will remain basically unchanged before 
and after the reform. According to preliminary calculations of 
282 industrial products across China, tax on 73, or 26 percent, 
of them will increase, while 209, or 74 percent, will decline. 
This shows the majority of industries and enterprises will not 
experience a tax hike as a result of the current taxation 
reform. Enterprises and products, however, vary in a thousand 
ways; and there used to be numerous tax categories and tax rates 
as well as diverse tax reductions, tax exemptions, and other 
preferential policies applicable to different enterprises and 
products. When a new and more standardized taxation system is 
introduced, we certainly cannot expect changes in individual 
enterprise's tax burdens to be uniform. But, the impact of tax 
increases in certain links can be eased through mutual 
readjustment. Take the circulation sector for example: According 
to the Ministry of Finance's general survey estimations, the tax 
burdens of wholesale enterprises will increase 0.44 percent, 
whereas retail enterprises' tax burdens will drop 2.5 percent. 
The increase in wholesale enterprises' tax burdens will be 
offset by the reduction in the tax burdens of retail enterprises 
and therefore, the reform will not trigger major fluctuations in 
the final retail prices directly borne by the consumer. 
Moreover, the reform will help further integrate production, 
wholesaling, and retailing operations. Macroeconomically 
speaking, because their turnover tax will not rise, retail 
enterprises should have no reason to increase their prices on 
account of the reform. All industrial and commercial 
enterprises should focus their attention on internal operations, 
take full advantage of the policies and measures for reducing 
enterprise's burdens that are already in force, improve 
management, and lower costs; on no account should they increase 
consumers' burdens by raising prices on their own under the 
pretext of taxation reform. 
  -- To facilitate implementation of the tax reform program, 
the state has adopted policies aimed at reducing enterprises' 
tax burdens, including merging enterprise income taxes, reducing 
tax rates, and cutting the nominal income tax rate of 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises from 55 to 33 
percent. Regulatory tax for state-owned enterprises have been 
abolished and they are exempted from contributions to funds 
collected for construction of key energy and transport projects, 
and the state budget regulating fund (two funds in short), which 
alone account for 25 percent of enterprises' after-tax profits. 
Enterprises can now keep them for their own use instead of 
submitting them to the state treasury. Instead of submitting 
them to the state, exclusively state-owned enterprises can keep 
their after-tax profits for their own use for the time being. 
Two interim tax rates -- at 27 and 18 percent, respectively -- 
will apply to enterprises operating under thin profit margins in 
the next two years. All these and other measures are aimed 
reducing the tax burdens of enterprises. Enterprises must take 
full advantage of these policies to build up their capacity for 
sustained growth and enhance their competitiveness in the market. 
  -- It is necessary to distinguish new loans from old ones 
and 
reduce enterprises' burdens to enhance their loan service 
capability. Today, many enterprises have worries about 
servicing their debt in the wake of taxation reform. 
Implementation of the measures for reducing enterprises' 
burdens should help increase their debt service capability. In 
consideration of the current status of enterprises, the state 
has decided to make a distinction between new and old loans, and 
introduce a new set of rules for new loans (rules for old loans 
will remain unchanged). Efficiently run enterprises may enhance 
their actual debt service capability by such measures as 
increasing depreciation deductions or incorporating interest on 
long-term loans into the production cost. As for enterprises 
with heavy debt burdens accumulated over the years, the state is 
formulating interim measures to solve the unreasonable debt 
burdens of these enterprises caused by external factors. 
  Wang Zhongyu also outlined measures for ensuring smooth 
implementation of the new tax system: First, it is necessary to 
effect a changeover from the contract responsibility system to a 
uniform tax system. Today, 80 percent of our industrial 
enterprises practice the contract system of managerial 
responsibility -- a form of management created by the vast 
number of enterprises and workers in the course of implementing 
reforms -- that has been instrumental in mobilizing the 
initiative of enterprises and workers, and in developing the 
productive forces. The introduction of the new tax system will 
fundamentally change the foundation which the contract 
responsibility system depends on for existence, because 
value-added tax [VAT] -- which will become the biggest tax 
category when the tax reform and tax-sharing system are put into 
force -- will be shared by central and local authorities, and 
collected by the State Administration of Taxation under a 
unified plan. Therefore, it would be unrealistic to practice 
the contract responsibility system on a large scale. Moreover, 
after the two sets of rules [Rules for the Implementation of 
Interim Regulations on VAT; Rules for the Implementation of 
Interim Regulations on Business Tax] go into effect, the cost 
structure will undergo changes and lead to a sizable drop in 
profits on the books. Many enterprises will find that there are 
no profit quotas or any profit at all, that serve as a basis for 
a contract system of managerial responsibility. All this shows 
that a nonstandard relationship of distribution cannot meet the 
needs of a market economy. In the face of these circumstances, 
we must further broaden our perspective of reform; instead of 
being absorbed in readjusting the distribution relationship 
between the state and enterprises as the only solution, we must 
actively explore new ways to invigorate enterprises. We must 
work conscientiously and implement, on our own initiative, the 
transition from the contract responsibility system to a uniform 
tax system. 
  Second, we should adopt flexible temporary measures in 
light of different conditions. Although regional preferential 
tax policies do not fully conform to the principle of equitable 
taxation, the abolition of regional preferential tax policies 
will affect the investment climate and impede further efforts to 
reform and open up because coastal regions are the windows on 
our country's reform and opening up. Bearing this prospect in 
mind, the state has adopted temporary measures. For instance, 
we may adopt temporary measures on refunding taxes within two 
years toward taxpayers who enjoy preferential state policies on 
taxation in the special economic zones and coastal areas. After 
the unified imposition of VAT on both domestically- and 
foreign-funded enterprises, we may adopt the method of returning 
the actual increases in taxes incurred by partly or wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises at the end of each year or in annual 
installments, with a view to ensuring the stability and 
continuity of foreign-related tax policies. Additionally, the 
State Council will take temporary measures toward certain 
special enterprises which originally enjoyed tax reduction and 
exemption policies. These measures will facilitate the smooth 
transition from the old taxation system to a new one. 
  Third, we should improve publicity efforts regarding our tax 
laws and regulations, and swiftly formulate and promulgate 
policies concerning the convergence of the old and new taxation 
systems, in an effort to give enterprises an idea of how things 
stand and banish unnecessary misunderstandings. Implementation 
of a new taxation system is an overall reform of the old system, 
as well as an important step toward the market economy. 
However, it entails the solution of many specific problems. 
For instance, the State Administration of Taxation has made 
specific provisions regarding next year's tax deductions for 
enterprises' stocks of raw and semifinished materials and 
finished products on which taxes have been levied this year. It 
has given full consideration to the actual conditions in 
enterprises. Enterprises' tax burdens will not be overly heavy 
or light. We have yet to formulate specific measures regarding 
the particular problems of special businesses. 
  Wang Zhongyu also urged enterprises to adapt to the new 
situation quickly and compete fairly in the market. He pointed 
out: We should change the concept of state-owned enterprises 
that they are units covered by state budgets and directly 
subordinate to competent government departments, in favor of the 
new notion that they are independent "taxpayers" possessing the 
property rights of a legal person. Like other enterprises, 
state-owned enterprises should operate independently, assume 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, pay taxes 
according to law, and compete fairly in the market. We should 
change the state's traditional practice of assuming too much 
responsibility for state-owned enterprises in favor of the 
objective law of market competition based on the survival of the 
fittest, as well as the new concept that chronically 
deficit-ridden enterprises that cannot repay debts on schedule 
should be declared bankrupt according to law. This will 
heighten enterprises' sense of urgency and crisis in seeking 
survival and development during market competition, as well as 
change enterprises' notion of only demanding tax reductions and 
profit incentives from the state during the course of reform. 
  Furthermore, we should earnestly implement the "two sets of 
rules," improve our work of evaluating assets and funds, and lay 
the foundation for enterprises' fair competition in the market. 
We should accelerate the readjustment of enterprises' product 
mix and organizational structure, transform state-owned 
enterprises' operating mechanisms, and actively but prudently 
promote a modern enterprise system.

People's Republic of China on Business Taxes" (hereinafter 
referred to as Regulations).

futures transactions referred to in item 5 of Article 5 of the

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- Rules for the 
Implementation of the Interim Regulations of the PRC on 
Consumption Tax 
  Article 1. These rules are enacted in accordance with 
Article 18 of the "Interim Regulations of the PRC on Consumption 
Tax" (hereafter referred to as the regulations). 
  Article 2. The term "unit" referred to in Article 1 of the 
regulations means state-owned enterprises, collective 
enterprises, privately-owned enterprises, share-holding 
enterprises, and other enterprises as well as administrative 
units, institutions, military units, social groups, and other 
units. 
  The term "individual" referred to in Article 1 of the 
regulations means individual operators and other individuals. 
  The term "within the boundaries of the PRC" referred to in 
Article 1 of the regulations means that the place of shipping 
and location for producing, processing on contract basis, and 
imported goods dutiable for consumption tax (hereafter referred 
to as "dutiable consumption goods") are within China's 
boundaries. 
  Article 3. The specific taxation scope for dutiable 
consumption goods listed in the "Table of Tax Items, Tax Rates 
(Tax Amounts)" as appended to the regulations will be carried 
out in accordance with the "Explanatory Notes for the Taxation 
Scope for Dutiable Consumption Goods." 
  A large case of 50,000 cigarettes (similarly hereafter) with 
a sale price at or above 780 yuan (excluding value-added tax 
payable by the purchaser, similarly hereafter) shall be levied 
at A-class cigarette tax rate. A large case of cigarettes with 
a sale price below 780 yuan shall be levied at B-class cigarette 
tax rate. 
  Article 4. The term of "dutiable consumption goods with 
different tax rates concurrently managed by taxpayers" referred 
to in Article 3 of the regulations means dutiable consumption 
goods with upwards of two different tax rates produced and sold 
by taxpayers. 
  Article 5. The term of dutiable consumption goods "produced 
by the taxpayer who pays tax at the time of sale" referred to in 
Article 4 means paid transference of dutiable consumption goods, 
that is, dutiable consumption goods transferred on the condition 
of obtaining money, goods, labor, or other economic profits from 
the transferee. 
  Article 6. The term "dutiable consumption goods produced and 
used by the taxpayer or dutiable consumption goods used in a 
consecutive production process" means direct materials used for 
producing final dutiable consumption goods, of which these 
direct materials are component parts. 
  The term "use in other aspects" means dutiable consumption

goods used by administration departments and non-production 
organizations for providing labor or for donation, sponsorship,

produced with raw and semi-finished materials purchased by the 
consignee under the name of consignment are not allowed to be 
treated as dutiable consumption goods processed on a contract 
basis, whether or not the taxpayer treats them as a sale in his 
financial arrangement. Such goods attract consumption tax at 
the same rate as that for the sale of self- manufactured 
dutiable consumption goods. 
  Consumption tax shall not be levied again on dutiable 
consumption goods processed on a contract basis if they are for 
direct sale. 
  Article 8. The time at which the obligation to pay 
consumption tax goes into force is to be in accordance with the 
stipulations of article 4 of the "Regulations," which are as 
follows: 
  1. The times at which the obligation go into effect for 
paying taxes for taxable consumer goods sold by tax payers are: 
  a. If goods are sold on credit or on an installment payment 
basis, sellers' obligation to pay consumption tax begins on the 
day of payment collection as specified in the sales contracts. 
  b. If goods are sold on an advance payment basis, sellers' 
obligation to pay consumption tax begins on the day when sold 
taxable goods are delivered. 
  c. If payments for sold taxable consumer goods are to be 
collected by a third party or by a bank, sellers' obligation to 
pay consumption tax begins on the day when the sold goods are 
delivered and the payment collection paperwork is completed. 
  d. If payments for sold goods are to be made in other ways, 
sellers' obligation to pay consumption tax begins on the day 
when payments are completely made or proof of collection of 
payments are received. 
  2. The time at which the obligation goes into effect for 
paying taxes for taxable consumer goods produced and to be used 
by tax payers themselves begins with the day when the goods are 
committed to use. 
  3. The time at which the obligation goes into effect for 
paying taxes for taxable consumer goods that are committed by 
tax payers to others for processing begins on the day when the 
tax payers take delivery of the goods. 
  4. The time at which the obligation goes into effect for 
paying taxes for taxable consumer goods imported by tax payers 
begins on the day when the imported goods clear the customs. 
  Article 9. The "sales quantities" stated in Article 5 of the 
"Regulations" refer to the quantities of taxable consumer goods. 
The details of these "sales quantities" are as follows: 
  1. For those selling taxable consumer goods, the quantity 
refers to the sales quantity of taxable consumer goods. 
  2. For those producing taxable consumer goods for their own 
use, the quantity refers to the quantity of goods committed to 
use. 
  3. For those who commit others to process taxable consumer 
goods, the quantity refers to the quantity of goods taken back 
by tax payers. 
  4. The quantity of imported taxable consumer goods refers to 
the quantity of imported goods of which payment of import duty 
has been certified by the customs. 
  Article 10. The standards of conversion of units for taxable 
consumer goods of which the amount of tax payment is computed 
according to the quantity of the goods are as follows: 
  1. beer: 1 tonne = 988 liters 
  2. millet wine: 1 tonne = 962 liters 
  3. gasoline: 1 tonne = 1388 liters 
  4. diesel: 1 tonne = 1176 liters 
  Article 11. According to Article 5 of the "Regulations," for 
taxable consumer goods sold by tax payers of which the amount of 
sales is to be computed with foreign exchange, the renminbi 
equivalent of the sales may be based on the exchange rate of the 
day on which foreign exchange is settled, or of the first day of 
the month in which foreign exchange is settled (in principle, 
the exchange rate should be the middle rate). Tax payers should 
decide in advance which rate is to be used; once it is decided, 
it must not be changed within one year. 
  Article 12. The "sales amount" stated in Article 6 of the 
"Regulations" does not include the value-added tax payment that 
is to be collected from the purchasers of goods. If payment of 
goods and value-added tax payment of taxable consumer goods are 
collected as a whole by tax payers because value-added tax 
payment is not deducted from the sales amount or because tax 
payers are not allowed to issue special value-added tax 
invoices, the consumption tax should be computed according to 
the sales amount excluding value- added tax payment. The 
equation for the computation is as follows: 
  Sales amount of taxable consumer goods = sales amount 
including value-added tax divided by (1 + value-added tax rate 
or the rate of tax levy) 
  Article 13. All taxable consumer goods that are sold in a 
packed form of which the tax payment is to be computed according 
to price rate -- whether or not the packing is charged 
separately and no matter what kind of accounting method is used 
-- should be included in the sales amount of taxable consumer 
goods for consumption tax purposes. If packaging materials are 
not sold with the products, but instead a security is collected 
for them, this security should not be taxed as a part of the 
sales amount of the taxable consumer goods. However, the 
security that is not returned to buyers because packaging 
materials are not returned within a specified period, and the 
security that has been kept for more than one year, should be 
included in the sales amount of taxable consumer goods and 
should be taxed according to appropriate tax rates of taxable 
consumer goods. 
  Security for packaging materials that are sold with taxable 
consumer goods should be included in the sales amount of the 
taxable consumer goods if the security is not returned to buyers 
within a specified period, and therefore should be taxed 
according to appropriate tax rates of taxable consumer goods. 
  Article 14. The "fees not included in the calculated 
prices" as mentioned in Article 6 of the "Regulations" mean 
funds, pooled resources [ji zi fei 7162 6327 6316], returned 
profits, subsidies, penalties for nonperformance of contracts 
(interest for delayed payments), collection for others, advance 
money for others, and other kinds of fees not included in the 
calculated prices. However, the following fees are excluded from 
the above-mentioned fees: 
  1. The carrier's invoices for purchasers. 
  2. Such invoices delivered by the taxpayer to purchasers. 
  All other fees not included in the calculated prices, 
whether 
they belong to the income of taxpayers or not, should all be 
included in the total amount of sales for tax calculation. 
  Article 15. The "sales prices of the same kinds of consumer 
goods" as mentioned in Article 7 and Article 8 of the 
"Regulations" mean the sales prices of the same kinds of 
consumer goods in the same month received by taxpayers or 
agents. If the sales prices of the same kinds of consumer goods 
in that month fluctuate, the average prices will be used in the 
calculation of consumption taxes. However, the average prices 
cannot be based on the following cases: 
  1. The sales prices are significantly low without proper 
reasons. 
  2. There are no sales prices. 
  If there are no sales during that month or if the amount of 
sales during that month has not been calculated, the sales 
prices of the same kinds of consumer goods in the previous month 
or the latest month shall be used in calculating consumption 
taxes. 
  Article 16. The "costs" as mentioned in Article 7 of the 
"Regulations" mean the production costs of taxable consumer 
goods. 
  Article 17. The "profits" as mentioned in Article 7 of the 
"Regulations" mean the profits based on the national average 
profits over costs of various kinds of consumer goods. The 
national average profits of various kinds of consumer goods 
shall be decided by the State General Administration of Taxation. 
  Article 18. The "costs of materials" as mentioned in Article 
7 of the "Regulations" mean the actual costs of materials for 
processing provided by a consignor. The consignor must clearly 
note (or use other methods to provide) the costs of materials. 
If the consignor does not provide the costs of materials for 
processing, the local taxation organizations shall have the 
authority to examine and determine the costs of materials. 
  Article 19. The "processing fee" as mentioned in Article 8 
of the "Regulations" means all fees obtained by the processor 
from the consignor for processing taxable consumer goods 
(including actual costs of supplementary materials purchased by 
the processor). 
  Article 20. The "duty-paying value" as mentioned in Article 
9 of the "Regulations" means the tariffs stipulated by the 
customs.

for taxation shall be examined and decided by the State 
Administration of Taxation. 
  2. The prices of other taxable consumer goods for taxation 
shall be examined and decided by various branches of the State 
General Administration of Taxation. 
  3. The prices of imported taxable consumer goods for 
taxation 
shall be examined and decided by the customs. 
  Article 22. "Other items stipulated by the State Council" as 
mentioned in Article 11 of the "Regulations" mean taxable 
consumer goods of which the export is restricted by the state. 
  Article 23. If consumer goods for export are rejected at the 
customs or if they are returned by foreign customers after 
receiving reimbursement of tax and reenter the country free of 
tax, the exporters must promptly repay the exempted amount of 
consumer tax to local taxation organizations. 
  If consumer goods exported directly by taxpayers are 
rejected 
at the customs or if they are returned by foreign customers 
after receiving reimbursement of tax and reenter the country 
free of tax, the taxpayers may, with the approval of concerned 
taxation units, postpone the repayment of the exempted amount of 
consumer tax until such consumer goods are allowed for sale in 
domestic markets. 
  Article 24. If taxable consumer goods marketed by taxpayers 
are returned by purchasers for poor quality or other reasons, 
the amount of collected consumption tax may, with the approval 
of concerned taxation units, be reimbursed to the taxpayers. 
  Article 25. According to the stipulations of Article 13 of 
the "Regulations," if taxpayers market taxable consumer goods in 
other counties (cities) or if they entrust other people to 
market taxable consumer goods in other counties (cities), the 
taxpayers should, after the sales of those consumer goods, pay 
consumption tax to taxation units in their respective localities. 
  If the general office and branches of taxpayers are not 
located in the same county (city), the taxpayers should pay 
consumption taxes in places where taxable consumer goods are 
produced. However, with the approval of the State General 
Administration of Taxation or its branches, the consumption 
taxes may be paid by the general office to the local taxation 
unit having jurisdiction over it on behalf its branches. 
  Article 26. The Rules for the Implementation of the Interim 
Regulations of the PRC on Consumption Tax shall be explained by

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- A Decision of the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee on Interim 
Regulations for Value-Added Tax, Consumption Tax, Business Tax, 
and Other Taxes Applicable to Foreign-Funded Enterprises and

or in the absence of such laws, in accordance with the 
regulations of the State Council. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises referred to in this decision

Governing Resource Tax of the People's Republic of China 
  Article 1. Units and individuals who mine minerals listed in 
these regulations or produce salt within the territories of the 
People's Republic of China [hereafter referred to as mining or 
producing taxable items] are taxpayers of resource taxes 
[hereafter referred to as taxpayers] and should pay resource 
taxes according to these regulations. 
  Article 2. The taxable items and amount of tax to be paid

governments may reduce or exempt resource tax according to the 
situation. 
  3. Other reductions and exemptions stipulated by the State 
Council. 
  Article 8. The quantity of items of which tax will be 
reduced or exempted should be calculated separately. The 
resource tax shall not be reduced or exempted if the quantity of 
such items is not calculated separately or if the taxpayer 
cannot correctly provide the quantity of such items. 
  Article 9. Resource tax shall be paid by taxpayers when they

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China has achieved 
satisfactory results in making inventories of state-owned assets 
and re-examining state-held capital funds. 
  The country carried out a large-scale trial examination last 
year which covered more than 9,400 enterprises and about 825,000 
administrations and institutions. 
  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli told a national working 
conference that through squaring accounts, over nine billion 
yuan in state- owned assets were found to have been excluded 
from accounts of the enterprises, and 144 billion yuan from the 
books of governmental administrations. 
  Liu said that besides presenting a rough understanding of 
the 
present status of state-owned assets and problems existing in 
management of the assets, last year's work has also helped 
define ownership of some state enterprises. 
  About 1.77 billion yuan in state-owned assets which have 
long 
been diverted to collectively-owned enterprises have been sorted 
out. More than 24.7 billion yuan in enterprise investments in 
other trades have been rechecked or recovered. 
  After the audit, Liu said, fixed assets in the 9,400-plus 
enterprises were revalued at 42 percent higher than before, 
showing a total revaluation volume of 180 billion yuan. 
  He pledged that the examination of state-owned assets will 
continue this year. The coverage will still be limited to 
10,000 enterprises. 
  According to the finance minister, enterprises involved will 
include the 1,000 enterprises chosen to undertake the tests of a 
new supervision mechanism, and the 100 large and medium-sized 
state- owned enterprises chosen to establish a modern enterprise 
system. 
  Some enterprises which will have their ownerships 
transferred 
and some key large and medium-sized state enterprises which need 
solid support will be also included.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- The total value of 
China's electronics industry in 1993 reached a record 135 
billion yuan, a hefty increase of 24 percent over 1992. 
  The latest statistics from the Ministry of the Electronics 
Industry show that the total sales of the industry in 1993 came 
to 98 billion yuan-worth, an increase of 34 percent over 1992, 
while tax paid reached 7.2 billion yuan, a rise of 12 percent. 
  According to the ministry, products such as SPC [expansion 
not given] exchanges, telephones, fax machines, microcomputers 
and mobile communication products saw an average increase of 
more than 50 percent last year. 
  During the same period, further improvements have been made 
in the structure of products, while software and information 
services have undergone rapid development. 
  This development trend has become even more obvious in the 
coastal areas, such as Tianjin and Shanghai cities, and Jiangsu, 
Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong and Guangdong Provinces, where the 
value of the electronics industry accounted for 62.7 percent of 
the country's total last year. 
  Shandong ranked first in China in terms of the development 
of 
its electronics industry, the ministry said. 
  The economic and technological co-operation between China's 
electronics industry and its foreign counterparts continues to 
expand, according to the ministry; the total export value of the 
industry last year increased by nearly 20 percent compared to 
the previous year. 
  Meanwhile, the number of foreign-funded major electronics 
projects has increased rapidly and they have become a major 
force in the industry, the ministry added.

  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (CNS)--China's metallurgical 
industry received U.S.$900 million of foreign investment last 
year with direct investment by foreign businessmen of U.S.$150 
million, according to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. 
  Foreign government loans were given to expansion projects of 
the Baoshan iron and Steel Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel 
Company and the Daye Steel Works expansion project in Hubei 
province and the seamless steel project of the Anshan Iron and 
Steel Company. U.S.$500 million was raised from the issuance of 
H stocks in Hong Kong by the Maanshan Iron and Steel 
Shareholding Company. China has also made progress in its 
cooperation in the exploitation of mines with Brazil, Mongolia 
and South Africa with more than 30 million tonnes of ore being 
imported to China. 
  China has also developed and cultivated its internal market 
for iron and steel products with such markets in Tianjin and 
Guangdong now operating. The state has further eased price 
controls over iron and steel products with such products whose 
prices were set by the state being reduced to three million 
tonnes and those under the control of the state mandatory plan 
dropping from 20.8 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes.

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- The number of non- 
governmental new and high technology enterprises run by 
scientists- turned-businessmen exceeded 40,000 by the end of 
1993, according to an official from the State Commission of 
Science and Technology. 
  At a press conference here today, Hui Yongzheng, 
vice-minister of the commission, said that over 10,000 such 
enterprises were set up over the past year. 
  High-tech enterprises refers to firms started by scientists 
which raise capital funds through non-governmental channels and 
enjoy independent management and hold sole responsibility for 
their own profits and losses. 
  For example, some of the country's best-known high-tech 
firms, such as Stone Company, Legend Group Corp., Beijing 
University Founder Co. Ltd. and Hope Computers Co. Ltd. are 
among these enterprises. 
  According to the Chinese official, the 40,000 
non-governmental firms, who in total have more than 600,000 
employees, hit a record profit of 25 billion yuan (2.9 billion 
U.S. dollars) last year. 
  He said that the businesses of these enterprises have 
extended to virtually all industries in the national economy 
while concentrating in technology-intensive industries including 
chemical industry, telecommunications, machinery, precision 
instruments, computers, building materials, medicines, 
biological products and environmental protection. 
  Hui noted that the average input in research and development 
has made up over 6 percent of these enterprises' total income 
and the scientific and technological employees have accounted 
for over 30 percent of their total staff. 
  According to Hui, China's large non-governmental scientific 
enterprises have got off to a good start in industrialization 
and internationalization of high technologies. 
  One example is that the Hope Computers Corporation under the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was started by eight 
graduates ten years ago, now has the largest share of the 
country's sales of cad products. 
  The Legend Group Corp. now holds ten percent of the 
international market in the sales of QDI [expansion unknown] 
personnel computer cards. 
  "In the next two years, the Chinese Government will work out 
a series of policies, documents and regulations in order to help 
the non-governmental technological enterprises grow in a 
healthy, sustainable, rapid manner, bringing them into the 
international market in a big way," Hui said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese citizens' per 
capita shares of meat and eggs grew for the 14th year to 31 kg 
and 9.3 kg last year, an agriculture official said here today. 
  Jia Youling, an official in charge of the country's 
livestock 
husbandry, said in a national meeting on rural work that the 
figures reflect rapid increases over the 12.3 kg and 2.6 kg 
averages listed in 1980. 
  He said China produced an estimated 36.2 million tons of 
meat, about 1.2 million tons more than the production target set 
early last year by the government, adding that pork accounted 
for about 76 percent of the meat produced. 
  China also produced an estimated 10.91 million tons of eggs, 
up 7 percent over the previous year. 
  Milk output totaled six million tons last year. 
  Jia attributed the rapid increase to market-style animal 
husbandry policies initiated in the late 1970s, including 
leasing of grasslands, lifting of prices of livestock products 
and extension of new technologies. 
  However, fresh efforts are needed to produce more and better 
meat to meet growing demands, thanks to the economic boom. 
  He said about three quarters of the country's grasslands 
have 
not been contracted to herdsmen and about 1.75 million herdsmen 
are living a nomadic life, which makes it difficult to make 
better use of and protect grassland resources.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Some Advice for Grain Hoarders"] </F>
  [Text] In some provinces in South China, grain prices rose 
sharply recently. An important reason for this, among many 
others, was that certain dealers hoarded grain for speculation. 
Therefore, we would like to give some advice to these people: 
Your speculative behavior is not in the interests of the 
country and the people and you will end up ruining yourselves. 
  Grain dealers have played a positive and meaningful role in 
enlivening the grain market and in promoting rural economic 
development. However, as middlemen under the socialist market 
economy, they must do business and make money honestly and in a 
legal way rather then seeking high profits to the detriment of 
the country and the people. Only in this way can middlemen play 
a positive rather than negative part in promoting economic 
development. 
  Some middlemen have played a negative role by hoarding grain 
for speculation. This tells us that imperfect market rules and 
immature markets make it possible for middlemen to hoard grain 
for speculation and that some middlemen are likely to become 
"profiteers." 
  Grain is a special product which is essential to the 
national 
economy and the people's livelihood and we cannot do without it 
for even one day. Those who create social disorder and infringe 
upon the people's interests by hoarding grain for speculation 
are usually rejected by the people. 
  Most of the blame for the recent sharp increase in grain 
prices in some places in South China should be ascribed to grain 
hoarders. They boosted grain price by hoarding grain, disrupting 
the relatively stable grain market and preventing the state, to 
a certain degree, from introducing major reform measures. 
  Some people maintain that the state should allow grain 
dealers to hoard a certain amount of grain under the market 
economy. This is incorrect because ours is a socialist market 
economy and the basic purpose of production and circulation is 
to meet the people's increasing daily material and cultural 
demands. We must improve economic efficiency, but we must also 
take social effects into account. How can the government remain 
indifferent to hoarding and cornering, which is designed to seek 
exorbitant profits and which goes against the interests of the 
state and the people? 
  It should be pointed out that the state is fully capable of 
restraining businessmen who hoard grain for speculation. For 
instance, the state can strengthen macroeconomic control. "With 
enough grain in stock, we will not panic." The grain price will 
fall when the state, which has sufficient grain reserves, sells 
grain in large quantities. Will the excessive grain the 
hoarders are stocking not become their burden if this happens? 
  We would like to advise the middlemen engaged in the grain 
business: You had better do business in a legal way no matter 
what economic status you have. If you try to seek exorbitant 
profits by hoarding and speculation, which infringes upon the 
interests of the country and the people, you will get nowhere.

  [Text] Xining, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese researchers 
have developed six new super-heavy-ear wheat strains after more 
than two decades' efforts by genetic breeding. 
  The newly-developed strains have many improved properties, 
which can be steadily inherited, said Xie Junfeng, who heads the 
group for wheat genetic breeding research of the Northwest China 
Institute of Plateau Biology under the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences. 
  The research group also made effective use of chromosomal 
variation of small wheat apical ear to increase the number of 
small wheat ears. The experiment has helped to find a new way 
of optimization through crossbreeding in the field of wheat 
genetic breeding. 
  The achievements passed a recent state appraisal. 
  Since China applied chromosomal engineering to wheat 
breeding 
in the 1950s, the country has been blessed with a group of 
improved varieties of wheat featuring fine characteristics such 
as strong disease resistance. But all these varieties proved to 
have only small plants and light ears. 
  In 1972, Xie and his fellow researchers discovered that 
chromosomes of wheat underwent variation under the special 
growing conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and cultivated a 
base material called "plateau 2d monomer" and achieved good 
results including heavy wheat ears in experimental planting. 
  The six wheat strains have been developed based on "plateau 
2d monomer", which means that China has made a major 
breakthrough in the breeding of super-heavy-ear and 
super-high-yield wheat. 
  According to the researchers, a large number of 
super-high-yield varieties of wheat will be crossbred in the 
next three to five years, as the six newly-developed wheat 
strains have all the excellent properties needed for hybridizing 
more new super-high- yield wheat varieties. 
  Trial planting of two new spring wheat varieties obtained 
through successful crossbreeding, which have been grown on dry 
farmland, have achieved the desired objectives of high yield and 
good quality. 
  The local government of Qinghai is adopting measures to 
spread planting of these two hybrid wheat varieties.

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China is to invest 
another 1.84 billion yuan in two major water-conservancy 
projects in the eastern part of the country, an increase of 50 
percent over 1993. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng informed a national working 
conference on the harnessing of the Huaihe River and Taihu Lake 
of this today, adding that the funds will be jointly raised by 
the central and local governments. 
  Premier Li Peng stressed earlier today that all the money 
intended for the two projects must be guaranteed and local 
people's enthusiasm in joining in the construction be spurred, 
according to Chen. 
  With a total population of 143 million and some 13 million 
ha 
of arable land, the Huaihe River valley and areas around Taihu 
Lake are major grain, cotton and vegetable oil producing 
regions. They generate one eighth of China's total agricultural 
and industrial output value. 
  However, the regions are also prone to natural disasters. 
Experts say that serious flooding hits the areas every three to 
four years. In 1991, when the region was hit by the worst 
flooding for years, economic losses amounted to 48 billion 
yuan-worth. 
  So far, 12 out of the 18 key water-conservancy projects in 
the Huaihe River valley have been started, with a total 
investment of 2.24 billion yuan. Seven out of ten similar key 
projects in the Taihu Lake area are under construction with 
investment totalling 1.3 billion yuan. 
  Chen said that the projects in the Taihu Lake area are to be 
completed by 1995, and the projects in the Huaihe River valley 
are to be completed by the year 2000. 
  In addition, the state councilor told the meeting that local 
governments in the areas concerned must coordinate with one 
another in the construction of the projects.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Staggering Growth for China's Rural </F>
Industries in '93"] 
  [Text] China's rural industries continued their phenomenal 
growth in 1993, racking up a staggering 45 percent of the 
nation's total export value. 
  Spurred by this rapid growth, hard currency income from 
these 
export-oriented firms saw a sharp growth of 60 percent over 1992 
totalling about 190 billion yuan ($21.8 billion). 
  According to Qi Jinfa, director of the Bureau of Township 
Enterprise Management under the Ministry of Agriculture, total 
output and profits of rural enterprises both grew by at least 40 
percent last year. 
  The total output value of rural enterprises last year was 
expected to hit 2.9 trillion yuan ($333 billion) and total sales 
volume 2.6 trillion yuan ($298 billion). 
  According to Qi, who was speaking yesterday in Beijing at 
the 
ongoing national conference on rural work the scale of township 
enterprises increased as more and more capital flowed in. 
  It is estimated that at least 400 township firms had output 
values exceeding 100 million yuan ($11 million) and more than 
300 had sales value topping that figure. 
  With the deeper reform, the director pointed out more and 
more rural firms introduced shareholding or cooperative systems 
or formed enterprise groups to meet the needs of a more 
competitive market. 
  About 10 percent of rural enterprises have become 
shareholding or stockholding cooperative companies while nearly 
100 rural industrial groups were established across the country. 
  "Township enterprises have played a significant role in the 
booming rural economy and in absorbing extra rural labour 
force," Qi said. 
  China has 900 million rural residents, the most in the 
world, 
and more and more farmers have left the farm since the beginning 
of reform 16 years ago in an attempt to earn more money from 
nonagricultural jobs. 
  Meanwhile, some 20-odd million rural enterprises are 
mushrooming in the country's vast rural areas and their output 
has topped one third of the gross national product (GNP) and 
more than 60 percent of the total rural production value. 
  Last year, some 112 million former farmers were employed by 
township enterprises, up 6 million over 1992, according to Qi. 
  And a total of more than 29 billion yuan ($3.33 billion) was 
injected by rural firms into the construction of infrastructure 
of various kinds in rural areas, making it a new and important 
investment channel for agriculture. 
  Qi said at least 60 percent of farmers' increased net income 
last year came from rural enterprises. 
  But some problems and difficulties still hinder the smooth 
growth of rural enterprises, Qi pointed out. 
  He cited the shortage of funds as the biggest problem, in 
addition to the lack of talent, especially in the less-developed 
central and western regions. 
  And the introduction of a market economy, new systems of 
taxation and other reform measures have also been a challenge to 
township enterprises' development, Qi added. 
  The director said great efforts, including financial 
support, 
are needed to spur the development of the rural enterprises in 
the central and western regions.

"Review of International Situation in 1993 and Future Prospects"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 was the second after the 
disintegration of the bipolar structure. Taking the whole 
situation into account, the international situation has tended 
to ease; economic factors are playing a more prominent part in 
international relations while a relative decline has been 
registered in the roles of military factors; regional conflicts 
in a number of "hot spots," which have been in existence for 
years, are achieving political solutions; and there are better 
prospects for bringing about world peace which has been sought 
for a considerable length of time. However, the world is 
not yet a peaceful one. Local armed conflicts have never ceased 
and new "hot spots" keep multiplying. The crisis in Russia is 
continuing. The end of the Cold War in particular, has further 
exposed contradictions among Western countries, which are 
currently plagued by deteriorating economic difficulties and a 
turbulent political and social situation. By contrast, Asia is 
rising and is enjoying an enhanced status and role in the world. 
The world's multipolarity trend has become more clear. 
International relations, as well as the internal and external 
strategies of major countries, are now going through 
comprehensive changes and readjustments. 
  Major Western countries are still trapped in the longest 
economic recession since World War II. Though its economy began 
to recover in 1993, the United States still finds it hard to 
resume the vigor of the old days. Germany is still struggling 
in vain to extricate itself from its current difficult position. 
This year, the European Community saw a negative growth in its 
economy and Japan is still at the low ebb of an economic 
depression. The economic recession currently plaguing the West 
is both periodical and structural and cannot be separated from 
the present difficult situation in their military industries in 
the wake of the end of the Cold War. Because of the conclusion 
of the Cold War, contradictions among major Western countries 
begin to sharpen, the public are more resentful of the 
traditional political forces, and many long-lasting ruling 
political parties have stepped down, one after another. At 
present, all major Western countries are readjusting their 
policies and placing their focus on the settlement of internal 
problems, coupled with an effort to rejuvenate their economy and 
facilitate social reform; yet they are encountering numerous 
problems. It is estimated that the economic situation in 
the West will not take a turn for the better until the latter 
half of the 1990's and they will have to wait till the end of 
this century and the beginning of the next before they are able 
to enter a period of new development. 
  Profound changes are taking place in the relations among 
Western countries. In the wake of the Cold War, their common 
enemy has disappeared, the unifying force has been weakened, and 
former allies are gradually becoming competitive rivals. 
Due to a deep-rooted reliance among the three, the United 
States, Europe, and Japan will continue to base their relations 
on coordination for a long time to come yet, at the same time, 
economic frictions and conflicts among the three are becoming 
more acute with each passing day, and their fight for dominant 
power in international and regional affairs will escalate. 
The dominating position of the United States is now under grave 
challenge. 
  Taking advantage of its position as the world's only 
superpower, the United States is trying its utmost to act as the 
"leader" of the world and of all regions; however, its strength 
has been relatively weakened and its "new interventionism" has 
been subject to constant setbacks. All these have served to 
show its difficult position of not having the ability equal to 
its ambition. At present, the United States has stepped up its 
efforts to readjust its internal and external policies. 
  Regional conflicts and local wars in 1993 gave rise to two 
trends. Breakthroughs have been made in seeking political 
solutions to problems in "hot spots" which have been in 
existence for many years. The Cambodia issue has achieved a 
basic solution. The peace treaty signed between Palestine and 
Israel marks a new beginning in seeking a peaceful solution to 
the Middle East issue which has lasted for nearly half a 
century. The day to terminate the rule of the white as well as 
the apartheid system in South Africa is on its way. On the 
other hand, however, wars are continuing in some new "hot spots" 
and the situation in a number of old "hot spots" is taking a 
turn for the worse. It is true that regional conflicts 
spreading in former Yugoslavia, specially in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of former Soviet Union, are 
attributable to national, religious, and territorial factors; 
yet the intervention of big countries in their fight for 
dominant power and spheres of influence have also made the 
problem more complicated and more difficult to solve. The 
frustrated military intervention of the United States in Somalia 
as well as the puzzlement of large Western countries over the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue have all showed clearly that sanctions 
and armed interventions are not solutions to such conflicts. 
Both positive and negative experience in solving regional 
conflicts have urged relevant big countries and the United 
Nations to readjust their policies step by step. In 
future, major Western countries will take their choice when 
making military interventions to stop regional conflicts and the 
United Nations has no alternative but to act according to its 
capability. 
  In 1993, Russia experienced a severe political turbulence 
while its economy was in crisis. The October incident put an 
end to the confrontation between the government and the 
parliament and now the country is enjoying a temporary 
stability. The future development of the Russian situation 
depends on what the government is going to do to end the current 
economic crisis, in which direction the new parliament intends 
to move, and in what way the central authorities are going to 
share power with local governments. Whilst seeking continued 
cooperation with the West, Russia is trying to strengthen its 
position in the CIS and to maintain its influence over Eastern 
Europe. Russia's intention to maintain its position as a big 
country is shown more clearly in its foreign policies. In 
recent years, Russia and the West have been divergent on more 
and more issues. 
  The most noticeable change in the international 
situation in 1993 is the rise of Asia. Asia's high-speed 
economic growth and relatively stable political and social 
situation have apparently enhanced its status and role in the 
international community. Asia has become a significant 
force in pushing forward the world's economic development and in 
safeguarding world peace. 
  In recent years, considerable growth has been registered in 
investment and trade among the countries of the Asian-Pacific 
Region and a multilevel regional and subregional economic 
cooperation structure is gradually taking shape, featuring 
openness and diversification. The convocation of the informal 
meeting for leaders of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Organization has further boosted the economic cooperation of the 
region. As regards the multilateral dialogue on Asian-Pacific 
security, the regional security forum advocated by ASEAN has 
been accepted by the countries concerned and this will also help 
check the spread of factors leading to instability in the 
Asia-Pacific situation. 
  Facing the rise of Asia, especially China's enhanced 
international status and influence, many countries in the world 
have attached greater importance to promoting ties with Asian 
countries and with China in particular. Major Western countries 
have also given added weight to Asia in their foreign policies. 
Asia is becoming a new arena for their competitiveness. 
The United States has stressed that it will lay particular 
emphasis on Asia in its future development strategy, advocating 
the idea of establishing a "new Pacific commonwealth." Japan 
relies more and more on Asia and discussions on "leaving the 
United States and returning to Asia" can be heard in the 
country. A number of Western European countries, such as 
Germany, have drawn up new policies toward Asia. On the other 
hand, certain forces in Western countries are still trying their 
best to prevent China from becoming strong and rich but they 
will find it hard to succeed under the present situation. 
  The formal meeting of Chinese and American state leaders in 
Seattle has been followed by all sides with close interest. 
This meeting gives people a message that both China and the 
United States are willing to set their eyes on the future and to 
improve Sino-U.S. relations on the basis of a broader vision. 
With the concerted efforts of both sides, a new beginning may 
emerge in the relations between the two countries. The 
normalization of Sino-U.S. relations is beneficial to both 
countries and will also exert a significant influence on 
strengthening the cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and on 
safeguarding world peace. 
  In the wake of the end of the Cold War, certain major 
Western 
countries have stepped up pressure on and interference in the 
affairs of developing countries. The exchanges of unequal 
value, as well as trade and technology protectionism, pursued by 
Western countries have added to the economic difficulties of 
developing countries, resulting in a widened the gap between the 
South and the North. At the same time, however, developing 
countries in Eastern Asia are enjoying high-speed economic 
growth and have become the motive force of the world's economic 
and trade development. Because advanced countries and 
developing countries are becoming more dependent on each other 
economically, and also because the markets in advanced countries 
have become relatively saturated, more and more Western 
countries are tending to open up the markets of developing 
countries. 
  The year 1993 has also witnessed the further growth of 
regional cooperative organizations among developing countries in 
Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The Third World has made new 
headway in safeguarding independence, opposing power politics, 
and in striving to set up a new political and economic world 
order. At the 1993 World Human Rights Conference, developing 
countries in Asia stood in the forefront of a struggle against 
certain Western countries which use the human rights issue as a 
pretext for interference in the internal affairs of other 
countries. The "Bangkok Proclamation" adopted by Asian 
countries as well as the "Kuala Lumpur Human Rights Declaration" 
adopted by the parliaments of all ASEAN countries, have all 
given expression to the independent stand of developing 
countries on the human rights issue. Facts clearly show that in 
today's world, the Third World continues to present a 
significant force not to be ignored. 
  In 1993, the trend of international economic regionalization 
enjoys a continued growth. The approval of the Maastricht 
Treaty shows that European integration will advance on a 
tortuous road; the North American Free Trade Zone will take 
effect in 1994; and the Asian-Pacific economic cooperation is 
being further strengthened. Meanwhile, the Uruguay Round of the 
GATT talks, which had lasted for seven years, finally reached a 
package agreement on 12 December. All this serves to show that 
although it may amplify trade protectionism and international 
economic competition, the trend of international economic 
regionalization will be restricted by the global development of 
the world's economy. From a long-term point of view, the 
multicentered development trend of the world economy will 
continue to grow in the future. The trials of strength and the 
growth and decline of the relative strength of different regions 
will produce a farreaching influence on the future development 
of the world situation. 
  Looking forward to 1994 in prospect, the Western economy 
will 
recover slowly; Europe and its neighboring regions will continue 
to be troubled by turbulence; and Asia will enjoy a relatively 
stable situation with its economy maintaining rapid growth. 
Different social systems, development patterns, and cultural 
formations will draw on the experience of each other and measure 
their strength through diversified competitions. Hegemonism and 
power politics will continue to the major obstacles of the 
world's peace and development, yet the old international order 
will be faced with more and more challenges.

  [Text] Washington, January 6 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
administration today took a unilateral move to cut imports of 
textiles from China by up to 35 percent in 1994. 
  Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, said that the new 
quotas will be placed on imports of certain textile and apparel 
products from China in 1994 at levels 25 percent to 35 percent 
lower than in 1993. 
  The move was seen as a retaliation to alleged "massive 
transshipment" and "significant overshipments" of Chinese 
textiles through third countries. Negotiations between 
Washington and Beijing in the last nine months failed to solve 
the issue before the bilateral textile agreement expired on 
December 31, 1993. 
  The Chinese side made it clear that the problem of illegal 
shipments should be dealt with seriously through negotiations 
provided there is clear evidence, but the U.S. side insisted on 
its unilateral power to impose quota reductions. 
  According to Kantor, the new quotas will be announced 
formally in a federal register notice, which will become 
effective on January 17, 1994, but it would apply to textile and 
apparel products that have entered into the United States after 
January 1 this year. 
  The sharp cuts cover 88 categories of products, including 
sweaters, knit shirts, cotton trousers and shop cloths used to 
clean machinery, according to Kantor. 
  The quota reduction is estimated to slash China's exports in 
those categories by 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Japanese Vice-Premier Tsutomu Hata will invite his 
counterpart, Zhu Rongji, to visit Japan during his forthcoming 
trip to China, according to Japanese sources. Mr. Hata, who is 
also Foreign Minister, arrives in the Chinese capital on 
Saturday and will leave for home on Sunday. 
  Diplomats in Tokyo and Beijing said Mr. Hata would convey 
the 
wish of the Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to 
further improve relations with China. They said Tokyo was 
anxious to expand its share of the Chinese market, given signs 
of an improvement in Sino-European and Sino-American ties. 
  Apart from his host, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen, Mr. Hata is expected to meet Mr. Zhu, President Jiang 
Zemin and Premier Li Peng. 
  Diplomats in Tokyo said that apart from bilateral issues, 
Mr. 
Hata would focus on security on the Korean peninsula, 
Sino-American ties, China's entry into the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, and Japan's investment in China. 
  "Hata, perhaps the most powerful figure in the Hosokawa 
Cabinet, has been forced to limit his visit to a little more 
than 24 hours because of political problems back home," a source 
in Tokyo said. "President Jiang and Premier Li are expected to 
see him even though Chinese leaders usually do not meet visitors 
over the weekend." 
  The source said Mr. Zhu would probably accept the invitation 
and make a trip to Tokyo later this year. Tokyo is very eager 
for Mr. Zhu to visit the country, as he is seen as a key 
politician in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. 
  Western diplomats in Beijing discounted recent reports in 
the 
Japanese press about a forthcoming visit to Tokyo by Mr. Jiang. 
They said there was little chance such a visit would take place, 
because Mr. Jiang had already visited Japan in mid-1992 as party 
General Secretary. 
  Chinese diplomatic sources said that during the Hata visit, 
Beijing might raise the issue of the fourth round of yen loans, 
even though the third round is not due to expire till 1995. 
Tokyo would be hard put to give a definitive reply, given 
Japan's aid commitment to a number of other countries, they said.

"Deng Xiaoping Arrives in Shanghai for Sightseeing, Plans To 
Spend the Spring Festival There"] 
  [Text] Information has once again verified that supreme 
communist leader Deng Xiaoping has already arrived in Shanghai. 
Informed sources in Shanghai disclosed that Deng Xiaoping's 
health is good, and that he has toured the municipality by car 
and listened to work reports by important party and government 
officials of the municipality. 
  The informed sources said that Deng Xiaoping, who is almost 
90 years old, arrived in Shanghai with his family half a month 
ago. Spending the Spring Festival in Shanghai has already become 
his habit. According to information, Deng Xiaoping's trip this 
time has no special significance, but he will still say some 
words on the development of Shanghai from the economic angle. 
  A certain government official in Shanghai said that Deng 
Xiaoping's visit to Shanghai is very important to the economic 
development there. He also disclosed that the central 
leadership will soon announce a more open and flexible economic 
reform policy. 
  According to sources, during his stay in Shanghai, Deng 
Xiaoping is staying mainly with his family; whether he will show 
his face on television on the eve of the Chinese New Year, like 
he did last year, will depend on the situation. 
  According to information, Deng Xiaoping will stay in 
Shanghai 
for about three months, and return to Beijing when the weather 
is warmer and flowers begin to blossom. 
  This is the sixth time Deng Xiaoping has spent the Spring 
Festival in Shanghai since 1988.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Fujian in southeast 
China is now top of the league of China's provinces in forest 
cover. 
  According to the fourth national survey of forest resources, 
trees cover 6.148 million hectares in Fujian, an increase of 
1.145 million hectares over 1988, and its timber reserves total 
395 million cubic meters, up 15.77 million cubic meters. 
  The forest cover in the province is 52.4 percent, giving it 
the lead among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions 
on the mainland, and 9.2 percentage points more than in 1988. 
  Fujian's territory includes 80 percent of hilly areas 
suitable for tree planting. It has become one of China's key 
timber producers. 
  A provincial official in charge of forestry disclosed that 
the province has formed a complete forest industrial set-up over 
the past four decades. 
  At present, the province has afforestation areas totalling 
1.81 million hectares, 500,000 hectares more than five years ago 
and an increase of 6.4 percent annually. 
  The official noted that the success resulted from scientific 
planting and administrative measures to ban indiscriminate 
felling of trees.

  [Text] A district court has sentenced a mainland Chinese 
man to nine years in prison and his wife to six for hijacking a 
mainland airliner to Taiwan last September. 
  The Taoyuan District Court meted out the prison terms for 
taxi driver Yang Ming-te and his wife Pan Feng-ying after 
finding them guilty of air privacy. The couple said that they 
would appeal. 
  Judge Chiang Hsiao-pei said that the court showed leniency 
to 
Yang because he surrendered [words indistinct]. His wife 
received the shorter term because she was only an accomplice, 
Qiang added. 
  The couple could have been sentenced to death. 
  The couple armed with a knife and fake explosives brought 
their son along when they hijacked the Russian-built Tupelov 154 
run by the mainland Sichuan Airlines to Taiwan on September 30 
and asked for political asylum. 
  Their six-year-old son has been placed in an orphanage. 
  A total of 10 mainland airliners were hijacked to Taiwan 
last 
year. So far (?talks) have been in a deadlock over whether 
Taiwan has legal jurisdiction over the hijackers. 
  Taiwan in principle has agreed to repatriate hijackers after 
trying them, but the mainland does not recognize Taipei's 
jurisdiction or power.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Xu Jun (1776 6511) and Wang Yonghua (3769 3057 </F>
5478): "Accelerate the Pace of Pushing Economic Development to 
a New Stage To Become Well-Off Ahead of Schedule"] 
  [Excerpts] We usually hold the municipal rural work 
conference after the Spring Festival. This time, however, we 
held this conference prior to the New Year, two months earlier 
than previous years. Yesterday morning, in an effort to seek 
early results, leaders of the municipal agricultural departments 
and various districts, counties and bureaus (general companies) 
and cadres of some townships, towns, sections and second-grade 
companies, a total of over 1,000 people, attended the 1994 rural 
work conference to plan, mobilize, and implement earlier than in 
previous years. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan attended and addressed the 
conference. Vice Mayor Duan Qiang delivered a work report, 
entitled: "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts, Deepen 
Reform, Expand the Degree of Opening Up, and Make Economic 
Construction of Suburban Areas Enter a New Stage." [passage 
omitted] 
  In his report, Duan Qiang put forward the guiding ideologies 
of the 1994 economic work of suburban areas on behalf of the 
municipal party committee and the municipal government: Firmly 
grasp the "nose of the ox," which is to emancipate the mind and 
seek truth from facts, strive to explore new ways and new moves 
in line with the target of establishing the socialist market 
economic new system, and use them to promote change and solve 
difficulties, deepen reform, expand the pace of opening up, 
accelerate economic development and the pace of becoming 
well-off in an effort to stimulate the suburban economy to enter 
a new stage. 
  The general fighting objectives of economic and social 
development in suburban areas in 1994 are: 
  Total industrial and agricultural output value should reach 
100 billion yuan, total social output value should reach 125 
billion yuan, an increase of 46 percent and 42 percent 
respectively over the previous year. 
  There should be four counties each with a total industrial 
and agricultural output value exceeding 10 billion yuan, one 
district with a total social output value of 10 billion yuan in 
the urban and rural areas and 10 townships each with a revenue 
of over 1 billion yuan. 
  The average per-capita income of peasants should reach 2,000 
yuan, up 350 yuan over 1993. 
  The average per-capita income of workers of 60 outlying 
townships and towns in the mountainous areas should reach 1,200 
yuan, up 150 yuan over 1993. 
  In addition, new achievements should be made in village and 
town construction, afforestation, and other aspects. 
  To realize the aforementioned objectives, we should actively 
advance the work in 10 aspects in 1994 and make new strides 
forward. Of these, the major ones are: To establish the 
ideology that we must rely on high efficiency to realize high 
returns in agriculture, follow the path of promoting large-scale 
production and greatly raise labor productivity and make new 
strides in developing "high yield, high quality, and highly 
efficient farming"; make new strides in developing industrial 
areas and building small cities and towns because they are the 
places where the hopes and momentum of suburban areas lie; make 
new strides in "carrying out large-scale projects, developing an 
export-oriented economy, making new plans, implementing new 
mechanisms, and using new technological equipment" because 
township enterprises are now entering a new development stage; 
establish the ideology that we must rely on using the export- 
oriented economy, science and technology to bring along economic 
development, and make new strides in linking with the 
international track and rely on scientific and technological 
progress; and establish the ideology of adopting policies of 
opening the mountainous areas to the outside world and make new 
strides in the "project of making the mountainous areas 
prosperous." 
  In his speech, Duan Qiang said: We should uphold the 
principle of taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both 
to strengthen party building, ideological and political work, 
and the building of spiritual civilization. It is necessary to 
regard the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping as strong motivation and continue to actively 
promote the emancipation of minds. We should strengthen the 
building of the ideology and work style of leading bodies at and 
above the township and section levels, strengthen the building 
of grass-roots party organizations and strive to build them into 
strong fight bastions for leading the masses into entering the 
market, become well-off and enter a new stage. We should 
persist in fighting corruption and promoting honesty and 
strengthen the building of a clean government and diligent 
administration, a socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, 
and the legal system. [passage omitted] 
  Also attending yesterday's conference were Wang Baosen, 
Ouyang Wenan, Duan Bingren, Qiang Wei, Li Yongan, Xia Qinlin, Lu 
Yucheng, Li Runwu, Meng Xuenong, Feng Mingwei, Lu Songhua, Fan 
Yuanmou, Han Boping and Huang Chao.

their economies, different localities in Guangxi have paid 
attention to commodity sales. Commodity sales in various 
localities are thriving amid stability. In society, commodity 
sales have seen a comparatively large increase. According to 
statistics, from January to November, Guangxi registered an 
increase of 20.8 percent over last year in total commodity 
sales. Five cities registered commodity sales increases of more 
than 23 percent. The total retail sale volumes of 
Fangchenggang, Beihai, and Nanning increased by 48 percent, 34.9 
percent, and 33 percent respectively. There were varying 
increases in commodity sales in the eight prefectures of the 
region, with Guilin, Wuzhou, and Yulin registering growth rates 
higher than Guangxi's average.

  [Text] China's intention to summon a civil servant to 
Beijing to explain the airport management plan to the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) signals the start of a fight 
for control of the bureaucracy ahead of 1997. 
  Beijing sent a written invitation to Chief Secretary Anson 
Chan, asking Hong Kong officials to visit Beijing. The letter, 
dated yesterday and printed in Chinese, said the invitation was 
at the request of the Chinese government. "The PWC's Economic 
Group sincerely invites government officials to attend the group 
meeting ... to explain some points contained in the Airport 
Corporation Bill so as to avoid misunderstandings," the letter 
said. It was signed by PWC leaders Nellie Fong and Gao 
Shangquan. 
  Describing the letter as "only a beginning", pro-China 
sources said: "From now on, the battleground between China and 
Britain will be the civil service." 
  It is understood China has a list of subjects on which it 
wants input from top-ranking local administrators--ranging from 
changes to laws to fit in with the post-1997 situation to 
infrastructural projects such as the new airport and Container 
Terminal 9. Such input is intended to help the PWC formulate 
policies for after 1997. 
  The pro-China sources also told The Standard that this 
tussle 
was signalled last month when some PWC members, notably Vincent 
Lo, head of the Business and Professionals Federation, suggested 
civil servants should be nominated to the committee. The 
suggestion met strong opposition from the government and 
legislators. 
  Beijing decided then that it could expect no cooperation 
from 
the administration and became even more determined to take 
control of the top rungs of the civil service to undermine 
Governor Chris Patten. Beijing is understood to have prepared 
for this fight. 
  In anticipation of the failure in the Sino-British talks, 
one 
of the first tasks assigned to the PWC was to seek talent and 
recommend local civil servants for all key positions. PWC 
member and former Executive and Legislative Councillor Rita Fan 
and others met more than a dozen top civil servants within days 
of the first PWC plenary session in July last year. It is 
understood that since then China has worked out who it does not 
want and who will hold key positions. 
  Among those it does not want are Chief Secretary Anson Chan, 
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Sze, and Director 
of Broadcasting Cheung Man-yi. It is also understood that China 
might like to see some former top-rank civil servants who 
resigned recently return to the service. 
  Chan is standing firm on her refusal of China's invitation. 
"I think I have already said we have well established channels 
of communication," she said yesterday. 
  Finance Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said: "If these people 
have questions of clarifications on the bill, they are welcome 
to put them and we will answer them. But there is no question 
of us sending people to Beijing to appear before the PWC." 
  In Beijing, the State Council's Hong kong and Macao Affairs 
Office director, Lu Ping, said he regretted the government's 
decision.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen: "Deng </F>
Xiaoping's Views on Inflation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan--The "Decision on Some Issues 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee in mid-November last year is now regarded as a 
hallmark signifying China's entering a new stage of economic 
structural reform where breakthroughs will be made in certain 
key areas while progress is made on all fronts. In order to 
implement the "Decision," the authorities called a series of 
meetings on economic work in early November, which resulted in a 
decision on introducing a number of plans in 1994 to reform the 
banking, financial and taxation, investment, foreign trade, and 
modern enterprise systems. Unexpectedly, however, the prices of 
grain and edible oil have risen drastically by up to 20 or 30 
percent in 35 large and medium cities throughout the country 
since late November last year, causing panic among the public. 
Eighteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have 
experienced a tide of panic purchases of grain, edible oil, and 
light industrial products. To deal with this, the authorities 
immediately started a comprehensive operation, since 
stabilization of the grain price and the control of inflation 
are crucial to the smooth implementation of all the reform plans 
this year. All the country, from the top leadership to the 
grass- roots level, is called on to plunge into a concerted and 
resolute effort to keep down the soaring prices of grain and 
edible oil with a view to creating a favorable environment for 
this year's comprehensive reform. 
<H5>  Ideas for a Free Economy Are Becoming Popular Among Cadres </H5>
  An informed source in Beijing quoted information released by 
the Ministry of Agriculture as saying that 1993 was another year 
of bumper harvest in China, the year's total grain output 
hitting a record high by outdoing that in 1992 which also 
enjoyed a good harvest. Information released by the Ministry of 
Internal Trade also revealed a storage of newly harvested grain 
kept by the state which roughly equaled that recorded in the 
corresponding period last year. However, the prices in the 
grain markets in coastal areas suddenly went up in late October. 
By late November, the retail price of grain in Guangdong 
Province increased by 10 percent over October while the rice 
price was rising in such grain producing provinces as Hubei, 
Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. The increase in the rice price in 
south China has affected the grain market in north China, 
causing the wheat and corn prices to increase to a varying 
extent. The grain price hikes have led to price increases for 
other commodities, thus causing panic among the public and a 
tide of panic purchasing of grain, edible oil, and even 
household electrical appliances in many cities. 
  The grain price is soaring at the moment as the country 
reaps 
a bumper harvest. What is the reason for this abnormal price 
fluctuation? Analysis shows that this is mainly because some 
leading cadres who lack a correct understanding of the market 
economy believe that the market economy means a completely free 
economy, that the state may leave the grain price alone once the 
restrictions on the grain price are lifted, and that any attempt 
by the state to keep down the grain price is against the 
principles governing the market economy and equates with 
backtracking. Based on this logic, they have let commodity 
prices increase without taking any anti-inflationary measures. 
The chain effects of price raises would have been increasingly 
aggravated if Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council, had 
not promptly called a national work meeting in Beijing on 25 
December to discuss and adopt measures to keep down the prices 
of grain and edible oil, after he found some problems during his 
inspection tour in Anhui in late November last year. 
  The informed source said that the grain price hikes and the 
panic purchasing tide had alerted Deng Xiaoping, who had urged 
the authorities to seize the opportunity to speed up 
development. Having read reports from some provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions in mid-December last 
year, Deng made the following comments to Yang Dezhong, deputy 
director of the CPC Central Committee General Office: 1) 
the above-mentioned occurrences reflect the delicate mental 
state of the public, of which party and government leaders at 
all levels should be clearly aware; 2) as far as the people's 
livelihood is concerned, party and government leaders at all 
levels must keep abreast with market developments at all times 
and do a good job in guiding and overseeing market operations; 
3) common problems which may arise from the reform, especially 
those related to the capacity to withstand the impact of reform 
on the part of the public, must be promptly brought to the 
attention of party and government leaders at all levels and put 
on the order of the day; and 4) the central leadership has paid 
close attention to the present case in a timely manner and 
adopted resolute measures, indicating that the present 
collective leadership is becoming mature. 
<H3>  Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji Step Forward To Accept 
Responsibility </H3>
  The informed source noted that the CPC authorities agreed 
among themselves, after Deng Xiaoping's retirement, that 
whatever major issues arise thereafter concerning national 
unification and economic construction will still have to be 
referred to Deng Xiaoping for advice. Therefore, they have of 
course paid great attention to the above comments by Deng 
Xiaoping on the panic purchasing. The CPC General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin personally called a meeting of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau on 24 December last year to discuss 
how to carry out Deng Xiaoping's instruction. 
  Jiang Zemin made a self-criticism at the meeting. He said: 
"Recently, many localities have experienced a tide of panic 
purchasing of grain and edible oil. This indicates that we have 
overlooked the public's reaction to price fluctuations while 
concentrating on the party's central task. Comrade Xiaoping's 
instruction is both a support for us and a criticism against us. 
We must not treat this tide of panic purchasing triggered off 
by widespread price raises as an individual event but view this 
issue from the high plane of economic development. We must not 
be ovedr confident about the public's capacity to withstand 
inflation and thus treat the problem lightly. Changes in the 
prices of grain and edible oil as basic commodities on the 
market have a bearing not only on the immediate interests of 
cadres and the public but also on the public's trust in the 
party and the government. They will affect the extent to which 
the public displays enthusiasm and initiative in reform and 
determines whether or not we will be able to create a stable 
social environment. Therefore, we must curb inflation 
resolutely and without hesitation." 
  On the following day, that is 25 December, at a national 
meeting on the operation to keep down the increasing prices of 
grain and edible oil, Zhu Rongji, on behalf of the State 
Council, accepted the responsibility for this occurence. 
Meanwhile, he pointed out that the principal party and 
government leaders in some localities were also responsible for 
the fault. He said that they, as leaders, must not only take 
the initiative in bearing responsibility but must also try to 
find out the causes for the case and draw a lesson from it. Zhu 
Rongji asserted: "Stabilizing the grain price and fighting 
inflation will be a task of crucial importance to the smooth 
progress of reform next year (that is, 1994). Our leading 
people at all levels must resolutely adopt every economic means, 
applying some auxiliary administrative means where necessary, to 
rigidly regulate the intensity of the price reform and keep the 
margin of price increases within a limit that is acceptable to 
the public." Zhu also urged the judicial sector to penalize 
according to the law those who corner the market, jack up the 
grain price for staggering profits, and practice favoritism by 
abuse of power. 
<H5>  Inflation Is the Greatest Risk Factor </H5>
  Thanks to the authorities' prompt reaction, the tide of 
price 
raises prevailing in certain parts of China in the fourth 
quarter last year has now been checked. However, this year's 
inflation situation still remains a question of common concern 
among the public. 
  The China Price Information Center holds that, given the 
intensity of regulation and control exercised by the state 
through its economic and price policies, the general commodity 
price level will be going up moderately and slowly this year. 
Specifically, it may go up by 10 percent as compared with the 
13 percent inflation rate last year. The center also pointed 
out: "Ample supply of grain means stability" and, so long as 
the prices of agricultural products remain stable, the market 
price level on the whole will not experience great fluctuation. 
  However, some economic experts hold that the reform process 
will involve more and more risk factors because China's economy 
is entering a high-growth stage. Of such risk factors, 
inflation must be the most crucial one. After all, China's 
economy is still rather delicate, the public's mental 
preparedness for economic impact is still rather insufficient, 
the economic development standard varies considerably from 
locality to locality, and the income gap between the rich and 
the poor is very wide. The authorities must be well aware of 
this situation and must not overestimate the community's 
capacity to withstand inflation. Last year, the commodity 
retail price level went up by 13 percent, the volume of living 
expenses in 35 large and medium cities increased by 20 percent, 
and the delayed effects of these developments will turn out to 
be a very great pressure on the economy this year. Therefore, 
the inflation rate may go up this year, given the expanded scale 
of investment in fixed assets, the impact of the unification of 
the foreign exchange rate system, and the increase in the prices 
of fuel and farm products. In addition, the view that equates 
the market economy to free economy is still rather popular among 
cadres and the phenomenon of price raises as a consequence of 
interference with the market by abuse of power will most likely 
reoccur from time to time. All these factors discourage people 
from being optimistic about China's success in the price reform 
this year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese entrepreneurs 
have condemned the U.S. for its unilateral action of sharply 
reducing its import quota for Chinese textiles. 
  Many people here believe that it is irresponsible for the 
U.S. to slash its imports of textiles from China by 25 percent 
to 35 percent in 1994, just at a time when the two countries are 
set to start their fourth round of negotiations on bilateral 
textile trade. 
  The U.S. action will seriously damage Sino-U.S. trade, they 
said. 
  A senior manager with the China National Textiles Import and 
Export Corporation told XINHUA that the U.S. action goes against 
the doctrine of free trade espoused worldwide, as well as the 
Multilateral Fibers Agreement. 
  "It creates new obstacles for Chinese textiles as far as 
access to the U.S. market is concerned, and will inevitably hurt 
the interests of American consumers," he said. 
  During the first 11 months of last year the volume of 
China's 
textile exports to the U.S. through normal channels accounted 
for 13.1 percent of the country's total textile exports during 
the same period. 
  Zhao Guohua, deputy general manager of the Sanhuan Woolen 
and 
Knitwear Corporation, based in Beijing, said China has adopted a 
series of measures to halt the illicit transshipment of 
textiles. Five Chinese companies were punished last December for 
illegal shipment of textiles, he noted. 
  "The U.S. action, in disregard of China's efforts to curb 
the 
illegal transfer of textile products, will not weed out such a 
practice; instead it will only harm lawful textile exporters," 
he said. 
  An official of the China National Textile Council said China 
is promoting a large-scale technological transformation of its 
textile industry, involving some U.S. interests. 
  "The Sino-American textile trade, as well as imports of 
textile technologies from the U.S. and other Sino-American 
co-operation projects are bound to be affected by the headstrong 
action taken by the U.S. as regards the textile import quota 
from China," he said. 
  He added that the obstinacy on the part of the U.S. in this 
regard is in fact a kind of power politics, "coercing the Third 
World countries with its economic supremacy." 
  All the people interviewed by XINHUA said they hoped that a 
way out of the impasse in the interests of both countries could 
be found through negotiations so as to guarantee a healthy 
development of bilateral trade, especially the textile trade.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China Calls U.S. Action `Ignorant'"] </F>
  [Text] China denounced the United States yesterday for 
having breached international norms by unilaterally slashing 
China's textile quotas. 
  "The U.S. announcement on January 6 of its intention to 
reduce quotas for Chinese textile imports by 25-35 per cent was 
unreasonable, flimsy and in total ignorance of international and 
bilateral agreements," pointed out Li Zhongzhou, a deputy 
director general for international relations of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). 
  The U.S. move has run counter to the Uruguay Round of talks 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which 
wound up last month with a new agreement to phase out quota 
restrictions on textiles within 10 years, he told China Daily 
yesterday. 
  "We cannot help doubting the sincerity of the U.S. in 
honouring multilateral agreements, with its steep rise in quota 
restrictions against China shortly after the birth of the Gatt 
Uruguay package," he said. 
  The U.S. decision has also trampled on the Multi-Fibre 
Arrangement of which both China and the U.S. are signatories, he 
explained. 
  The arrangement stipulates that the quota imposed by an 
importing nation or region on any textile product must not be 
less than its actual import volume during the previous year. 
  And the importer must increase the amount of imports under 
quota management by at least 6 per cent per year. 
  Li said the U.S. practically has not increased quotas for 
Chinese textile imports. The latest massive reduction "speaks 
volumes about the fact that the U.S. is binding other nations, 
but not itself, to international agreements. 
  He said the U.S. also has ignored the eighth provision of 
the 
Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which rules that an importer should 
first consult with an exporter if the former claims illicit 
exports from the latter. If the two sides can't reach a 
solution, they should resort to the Textile Surveillance Body 
(TSB). "The U.S. apparently has not complied with this 
practice," Li said. 
  He said the U.S. lacks sufficient proof for its charges 
against China's "massive illicit transshipments." 
  "And whatever proof it has, the U.S. can hardly justify its 
reduction by as much as 25-35 per cent," he asserted. 
  It is obvious that the U.S. is seeking trade protectionism 
under the veneer of stopping illicit transshipments, he added. 
  He also blamed the U.S. for being unwilling to join hands 
with China to clamp down on such illegal activities. 
  He said China had hoped to set up a strict inspection system 
in co-operation with the U.S. to combat the problem, but the 
U.S. has insisted on its right to slash China's quotas 
unilaterally. 
  "The U.S. is not ready to co-operate in the least sense." he 
said. 
  He urged the U.S. to revoke its decision and return to the 
negotiation table to find a satisfying solution. 
  "Otherwise, China will be forced to submit the dispute to 
the 
arbitration of the TSB, and respond with retaliatory measures," 
he said.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "MFN Hangs in Balance"] </F>
  [Text] A top Chinese trade official said last week that 
Sino- U.S. economic relations will remain buoyant this year, but 
she warned of the dangers of political interference. 
  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi 
recognized the very complimentary nature of the Chinese and 
American economies and the fact that bilateral trade had surged 
in recent years. 
  Trade between the two hit $23.2 billion in the first 11 
months of last year, well ahead of 1992's total of $17.5 billion. 
  However the U.S.'s annual review of China's 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) status remains a problem. 
  "It is unwise to add political conditions to the MFN as a 
means of pressure," she said. "It will only damage our 
bilateral economic and trade relations." 
  She described as "unacceptable" the recent remarks by the 
U.S. Government that "China's human rights and arms sales will 
be part of the MFN." 
  The U.S. has until June to decide whether to extend China's 
status for another year. 
  Analysts said the review mechanism has thrown a cloud of 
uncertainty over Sino-U.S. relations and the both business 
communities. 
  "We hope to get rid of the shadow haunting the MFN issue so 
that bilateral economic relations can make greater progress," Wu 
said. 
  She is scheduled to preside over an important meeting in 
Washington this April along with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron 
Brown. 
  The eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on 
Commerce and Trade aims to shed light on a wide range of issues 
concerning bilateral trade and investment. 
  "I believe this session will be positive for our bilateral 
relations," Wu said. 
  During the meeting, China will stage two large-scale trade 
and investment fairs. 
  High-profile business people from the two countries will be 
present and seek co-operation in a series of major projects, Wu 
said. 
  But she did not mention the specific fields to which these 
projects belong. 
  Wu said China attaches great importance to developing 
Sino-U.S. economic relations, but she maintained that trade 
conflicts "should be tackled through consultation rather than 
unilateral retaliation." 
  She revealed that she would discuss with Brown the 
discrepancies in trade statistics between the two countries. 
  Meanwhile, Wu expressed optimism about China's re-entry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the Gatt's 
Uruguay agreement takes effect. 
  "China is now qualified to resume its contracting party 
status in Gatt," she said. 
  And she added that issues raised by other Gatt contracting 
parties "are liable to be solved through earnest consultation." 
  Gatt has decided to convene the 16th session of its working 
party on China in Geneva in March, which Wu said will be a 
strong stimulus to China's bid to rejoin the world trade body. 
  She said a uniform foreign exchange rate, adopted since 
January 1, will further mesh China's trade regime with Gatt 
rules.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- A high-capacity 
electronic mobile telephone exchange, the EMX 2500, has 
officially gone into service in Shanghai, China's largest city. 
  The exchange was bought from the Motorola company of the 
U.S. 
  The number of mobile telephone users has increased rapidly 
in 
China in the past few years, and Shanghai's original mobile 
telephone system had reached its full capacity before the 
exchange was introduced. 
  Sources at Motorola's Beijing office said the equipment of 
the EMX 2500 digital telephone exchange system belongs to the 
latest generation of the company's cellular products. 
  Pertti Johanson, vice-president and general manager of 
Motorola's international cellular infrastructure division, said 
that, so far, more than 120 Chinese cities have introduced 
cellular systems from Motorola. 
  The software of the EMX 2500 in operation in Shanghai has 
been modified to better meet the requirements of China's 
telecommunications networks, he added. 
  The introduction of the large-capacity telephone exchange in 
Shanghai will not only enhance call-processing speed, but also 
lay a solid foundation for the network and capacity to expand.

  [Text] Moscow, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Russian press today 
canceled a scheduled boycott after a government concession on a 
major hike of printing costs. 
  More than 20 Russian newspapers decided yesterday to stop 
publishing from January 11 to 17 when the new parliament opens 
its first session and U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Russia. 
  The move was designed to protest against a November 25 
government decree which would raise the printing costs by five 
times. 
  To avert the press revolt, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin 
today held talks with the editors-in-chief of these newspapers 
and decided to suspend the decree.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua met with Olof Lundberg, director-general 
of the International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), 
here this afternoon. 
  The two sides had a cordial and friendly talk on topics of 
common interest. 
  During the meeting, Zou expressed his thanks to Lundberg for 
his role in promoting China's cooperation with other Inmarsat 
member countries. 
  He expressed the belief that the setting up of Inmarsat's 
representative office in Beijing would further enhance this 
cooperation. 
  Lundberg voiced his appreciation for China's support for 
Inmarsat. 
  He said Inmarsat is directing more and more attention to the 
Asia and Pacific region, which boasts rapidly growing economies. 
  China is the ideal place for Inmarsat to establish its first 
representative office outside its London headquarters, he said. 
  According to sources here, Inmarsat, set up in 1979, is a 
commercial organization between governments. With 71 member 
countries, its aim is to provide better communications services 
to ships and aircraft via its maritime satellites.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- The Olympic Games 
should be held in a Third-World country in the near future, said 
He Zhenliang, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee here on 
Saturday. 
  "Since the International Olympic Committee [IOC] has had the 
intention of making a new breakthrough in popularizing Olympism, 
the Olympic Games should be moved out of the circle of developed 
countries and a Third-World country should be awarded the games 
in the near future," he said. 
  The Chinese Olympic chief made his statement when he 
reviewed 
China's sports in the past year at a press conference following 
the announcement of a vote for the top ten world athletes of 
1993. 
  He said Beijing's close loss of 43-45 votes to Sydney in the 
Monte Carlo IOC vote to choose the host city for the 2000 
Olympics last September was by no means a tragedy for China's 
sports. On the contrary, Beijing's bid was fruitful and 
significent, because it has helped to spread the Olympic spirit 
among the largest population of the world. 
  Answering the question if China would bid again for the 2004 
games, he said the Chinese Olympic Committee would take into 
full consideration both the world and domestic situation before 
making any decision. 
  "Many foreign friends and IOC members as well as our 
domestic 
suporters have written to me, wishing that we bid again for the 
2004 games. I'd like to thank them for their warm 
encouragement, but there is still a lot of time before we make 
our decision," he said. 
  An IOC weekly bulletin last December said that 14 cities are 
interested in bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games -- Cape Town, 
Durban and Johannesburg of South Africa, Beijing of China, 
Dusseldorf and Aachen of Germany, St. Petersburg of Russia, 
Buenos Aires of Argentina, Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro of 
Brazil, Stockhom of Sweden, Seville of Spain, Istanbul of Turkey 
and San Juan of Puerto Rico. 
  He Zhenliang said, "The IOC wishes China could try again for 
the 2004 games, but it's not time yet to make any formal 
decision."

  [Text] Shanghai, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Many large 
overseas companies have found it a good chance to make big money 
in the expansion of the Shanghai Rainbow Airport, one of China's 
biggest international airports. 
  The companies include the Goldman Sachs Corporation and the 
Tams Consultants Incorporation in the United States and the 
Well's Pacific Corporation Ltd. in Italy and the Asia Pacific 
Group in Taiwan. They are now competing with each other to win 
the bid for the expansion of the airport. 
  HNTB Architects, Engineers and Planners, one of the most 
renowned firms of its kind in the United States, has expressed 
its interest in designing of the expansion project. 
  The Shanghai Rainbow Airport received 65,000 flights with 
seven million passengers last year. 
  The blueprint for the expansion of the airport has been 
approved by the China Civil Aviation Administration and the 
Shanghai Municipal Government. 
  The new airport will occupy 20.4 square kilometers, five 
times the area of the present one. It will be able to receive 
260,000 flights with 40 million passengers a year by the time 
its expansion is completed, five and six times the present 
capacity, respectively. 
  A total of seven billion yuan will be invested in the 
expansion of the airport. Bids will be invited for the 
expansion of the airport's lounge building and its second runway 
construction, according to Du Chuncai, general manager of the 
airport.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton Is To Face Trouble in His European </F>
Trip"] 
  [Text] After taking office last year, U.S. President 
Clinton continued to announce that he would focus his attention 
primarily on solving domestic economic problems. Over the past 
year, however, he had to spend a great deal of time dealing with 
problems in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and the Middle East, and he 
was bogged down in a terrible predicament. Shortly after 1994 
began, he packed his bags and prepared for a European tour. The 
purpose of his trip was to appease his West European allies, 
persuade the East European countries, and adjust relations with 
Russia. Even though his mother has just died, Clinton decided 
to set off today according to the original schedule. He will 
successively visit Brussels, Prague, Moscow, Minsk, and Geneva. 
In Brussels, he will attend the NATO summit meeting, and in 
Moscow, he will meet Russian President Yeltsin. These will be 
the two most important events on his itinerary. 
  NATO is a military group composed of 16 Western countries. 
Its original target was the former Soviet Union and the East 
European bloc. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union 
and the drastic changes in Eastern Europe, however, NATO's 
orientation became a subject of debate among its member 
countries. At the same time, some East European countries 
applied to join NATO. At the upcoming NATO summit meeting, a 
major topic of discussion will be whether to admit East European 
countries into NATO. Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union 
and the governmental changes in the East European countries, 
their military alliance--the Warsaw Pact--ceased to exist. This 
brought about a so-called a "vacuum" in Eastern Europe. On the 
other hand, the Russian domestic situation continued to be 
unstable, and division and ethnic conflicts occurred in some 
East European countries, such as Yugoslavia. Therefore, Poland, 
Hungary, Czech, Slovakia, and Lithuania successively demanded 
that they be admitted into NATO in order to seek protection 
against possible crises. These demands brought the NATO 
countries into a dilemma. 
  First, Russia had already explicitly expressed its 
opposition 
to NATO's expansion to the East and regarded this as a "threat" 
against Russia. Because of Russia's status and its current 
delicate domestic situation, NATO countries have no choice but 
to give consideration to its feelings. On the other hand, if 
these East European countries are admitted into NATO, it will 
inevitably cause a division between them and the rest of the 
East European countries. If all East European countries, 
including Russia, are admitted into NATO, then we will have the 
situation that Kissinger described when he said "an alliance 
that includes everyone is in fact an alliance of nobody." This 
is obviously unrealistic. 
  What to do? The United States has proposed establishing the 
"Partnership for Peace" as a compromise. According to this 
proposal, NATO may conclude bilateral agreements with Russia and 
other East European countries on increasing military 
cooperation, including carrying out joint military maneuvers and 
training. For those countries that have explicitly expressed 
their hope to join NATO, the "partnership for peace" may be a 
transitional stage before they officially become NATO members. 
It has been said that the option proposed by the United States 
would not offend Russia and would also satisfy the demands of 
some East European countries. The proposal has been supported 
by all other NATO members. 
  Clinton's visit to Moscow and his meeting with Russian 
President Yeltsin will test U.S. policies and tactics. 
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United 
States actively supported Yeltsin and his radical reform 
policies and made great efforts to persuade other Western 
countries to give Yeltsin substantial assistance. The United 
States consistently sided with Yeltsin throughout the prolonged 
confrontation between Yeltsin and the former Russian parliament. 
In the recent Russian legislative elections, however, the 
political party Russia's Choice, which represents the 
pro-Yeltsin bloc, encountered a setback, and the rising star was 
the "Liberal Democratic Party," which represents extreme 
nationalist forces. This fact shows that the radical reform 
policies that have been pursued by Yeltsin have been unpopular. 
Zhirinovsky, the leader of the newly rising "Liberal Democratic 
Party," was encouraged by the election results and began to more 
fanatically advocate great-nation chauvinism. He even called 
for expanding Russia's territory and launching a war. In facing 
this situation, Yeltsin had no choice but to keep the United 
States at a distance. It is now difficult to predict Russia's 
future, and the United States has been rather anxious about 
this. Therefore, the United States found it necessary to adjust 
its policy and tactics toward Russia. The United States will 
continue to give Yeltsin positive support, but it will also try 
to prevent this practice from giving an excuse to the opposition 
forces in Russia and from stimulating the development of 
nationalism in Russia. The United States will continue to 
support Russia's reform, but it will also require the reformist 
to adopt a more moderate and gradual method and to prevent 
excessively radical measures from going beyond the Russian 
people's endurance. Russia obviously holds an important 
position in the foreign policy consideration of the United 
States. Clinton will certain bargain with Yeltsin. However, how 
successful will he be? People will have to wait and see.

  [Text] Seoul, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Some visiting 
American congressmen today expressed support to dialogue with 
Pyongyang on nuclear issue, rather than seeking a solution to it 
by imposing sanctions. 
  Chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Sen. 
Sam 
Nunn and other congressmen told South Korean Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-joo that they expect some progress be made in ongoing 
negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) as one side, and the United States and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as another side. 
  They said that dialogue, at least for now, is the best way 
for solving the nuclear problem. 
  The U.S. congressmen arrived here last week after visiting 
Russia and Japan. 
  According to latest reports, the IAEA is expected to wind up 
working-level negotiations with DPRK on inspections of the 
DPRK's nuclear sites in a day or two, and dispatch a team of 
inspectors to Pyongyang. 
  The DPRK, South Korea and the U.S. are expected to 
simultaneously announce their positions on three issues when the 
IAEA team arrives in Pyongyang. 
  The three issues are inter-Korean exchange of special 
envoys, 
suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint South Korea-U.S. military 
exercise, and high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. 
  Pyongyang is expected to announce that it will resume inter- 
Korean talks, and is willing to open working-level contacts with 
Seoul to discuss mutual nuclear inspections based on the 
south-north non-nuclear declaration. 
  Seoul will announce that it is willing to suspend the "Team 
Spirit" exercise, while Washington is to announce that it will 
hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang on 
condition of the IAEA nuclear inspection and inter-Korean talks.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is stepping 
up efforts to further improve its laws and regulations in order 
to guarantee economic success. 
  Reforms of modern enterprise systems, futures stock markets, 
real estate agencies, talent exchange markets and social 
insurance systems top the agenda of legislation this year. 
  Officials in relevant departments said that the formation of 
an economic operating mechanism is the city's focus of a new 
reform package, which is designed to make the socialist market 
economy a success. 
  Laws, regulations and rules will be formulated for more than 
200 aspects, according to an official. 
  Statistics show that Shanghai, China's largest metropolis, 
has drawn up more than 370 laws and regulations over the past 
nine years. 
  The Pudong Development Zone in east Shanghai has issued 14 
policies, laws and regulations, which include permission for 
overseas businessmen to open department stores, supermarkets, 
banks and insurance firms. 
  Officials said that the local legislative work is 
highlighted 
by its concentration on economics, which makes up as much as 60 
percent of the total legislation drawn.

  The exchange was jointly built by the Shanghai Municipal 
Committee of Agriculture, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for 
Restructuring the Economy, the Shanghai Industrial and

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has become a 
mecca for overseas businessmen, with several new trends emerging 
in recent years. 
  According to the latest statistics, the city approved 3,752 
foreign-funded enterprises in 1993, with promised and direct 
investment hitting 10.387 billion U.S. dollars and 6.28 billion 
U.S. dollars, respectively. The figure is more than the total 
for the previous 14 years. 
  It is also reported that there was an increase in the number 
of well-known, trans-national companies undertaking large 
projects during the year, indicating their firm confidence in 
the enhanced investment environment. 
  Last year 202 projects involving real estate and 
infrastructure, and funded with over 10 million U.S. dollars 
were started, compared to only 44 in the previous two years. 
  Among the big names were included America's Motorola Inc. 
and 
Mars Inc., Japan's Matsushita Electrical Works Ltd, Australia's 
Cadbury Schweppes Plc., and others from Hong Kong, Thailand, 
South Korea and Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, considerable investment was directed to tertiary 
industry. Among the newly approved foreign-funded firms, 33 
percent are in this field, compared with only 7.3 percent in 
1992. 
  Experts attribute the trend to the city's ambitious plan to 
become a financial, tourism and commercial center. 
  In addition, 696 firms solely invested by overseas 
businessmen to the tune of 340 million U.S. dollars, opened in 
Beijing last year, covering sectors such as electronics, 
clothing, medicines, foodstuffs, furniture and communications.

Reporter Wang Chunhai (3769 2504 3189): "To Build a Province 
Strong in the Economy, We Must First Build a Province Strong in 
Opening Up"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 21 December, at the auditorium 
of the Shijiazhuang City Workers' Cultural Palace, the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government held a 
provincial mobilization and report rally on opening up with a 
subject of strengthening reform, expanding the scale of opening 
up, accelerating development, and building an economically 
strong province. Participating in the rally were the 
secretaries of various city and prefectural party committees, 
the mayors of various cities, and the commissioners of various 
prefectures who were participating in the seventh plenary 
session of the fourth provincial party committee. Also 
participating in the rally were cadres of the organs directly 
under the provincial authorities and cadres at or above the 
section level in Shijiazhuang city. The total attendance was 
more than 2,000 people. Leading comrades of the provincial 
party committee, the provincial people's congress standing 
committee, the provincial government, and the provincial 
committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,

governments of Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou 
cities, Chen Liyou went to Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang 
provinces to specially observe these provinces' situation in 
economic development and opening up. After hearing the 
investigatory report made by the observation team, the 
provincial government considered that this report was great 
guiding significance in effecting a strategic change in the 
province's opening up and in accelerating the pace of opening 
up. Then, the provincial government decided to hold this 
mobilization and report rally with the aim of further 
strengthening, by introducing the experiences of Shandong, 
Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, the sense of urgency, the sense 
of crisis, the sense of being enterprising, and the sense of 
responsibility in implementing the guidelines of the third 
plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and in making 
arrangements for the work of the next year, with the aim of 
emancipating the mind, fully understanding the important 
position and role of opening up in building an economically 
strong province, and with the aim of mobilizing all the people 
in the province to implement the strategy of "using 
export-oriented economy to bring along the entire economy," to 
energetically develop the export-oriented economy, and to 
develop the provincial economy in a sustained, rapid, and sound 
manner. 
  Ye Liansong, governor of the province, presided over the 
rally. Chen Liyou, vice executive governor of the province, made 
a investigatory report on the opening up situation of Shandong, 
Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. After comparing Hebei 
province's major economic development targets with those of 
Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces over the past two 
years, Chen Liyou said: The reasons for the rapid economic 
development of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces are as 
follows: First, they have persistently regarded development as 
an unchanging principle and have promoted opening up by 
continuously emancipating the mind. Second, in approaching the 
relations of opening up and export-oriented economic development 
with the overall situation of economic development, they have 
all defined the new economic guiding ideology, regarded the 
development of export-oriented economy as the dragon head of the 
economic development of the whole province, and implemented the 
strategy of "using export-oriented economy to bring along the 
entire economy." Third, they have persisted in the 
export-oriented economic development road of developing the 
economy under the guidance of foreign trade, making a 
breakthrough in utilizing foreign funds, and developing 
high-level foreign economic relations and have grasped foreign 
trade, foreign funds, and foreign economic relations 
simultaneously. Fourth, they have made higher and lower levels 
join hands in improving investment environment, concentrated 
financial and material resources on accelerating the building of 
tangible environment, and paid attention to power delegation 
with one hand and service with the other hand to improve 
intangible environment. Fifth, they have expanded the scale of 
external propaganda, positively and voluntarily sponsored 
various forms of activities to absorb foreign investment, and 
vigorously conducted trade talks with good results. Sixth, they 
have paid attention to building development zones and made them 
new growing points of the economy. Seventh, they have 
vigorously trained competent persons suitable for the 
development of export-oriented economy. Eighth, they have been 
diligent to do concrete work in coordination with others. They 
have put in practical endeavor in opening up, strived for 
practical results, wholeheartedly attended to work, gone all out 
to anticipate others, and found shortcomings in front of 
achievements. 
  Cheng Weigao made a speech at the rally. He said: Although 
Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces have effected a rapid 
progress in economic construction and a rapid increase in 
economic strength, they still pay attention to emancipating the 
mind continuously and repeatedly, use the large-scale 
emancipation of the mind to promote the large-scale opening up, 
and use the large-scale opening up to promote the large-scale 
economic development. When the environment is relaxed, they 
fear no difficulties and dare to compete with others; when 
results are achieved in their work, they continuously find out 
shortcomings and problems; and when there are difficulties in 
their work, they do not blame others but stress on objective 
reasons. Such an enterprising spirit of regarding development 
as unchanging principle and always advancing bravely, pioneering 
the road of advance, and accelerating development under any 
circumstance much merits our studying. 
  Over the past two years, our province has achieved results 
in opening up. Not only the degree, scale, channels but also 
the scope, quantity, and quality of opening up have improved and 
developed continuously. Particularly since the issuance of 
Comrade Xiaoping's important speeches made during his south 
China trip and since the convocation of the 14th CPC Congress, 
we have effected doubled increases in utilizing foreign funds, 
in developing the three types of foreign-invested enterprises, 
and in importing funds, technology, and talents. This has 
played an important role in developing the province's economy. 
However, we still lag behind if compared to coastal provinces, 
to the situation of whole country, and even to some inland 
provinces with good performance. About two years have passed 
since the 14th CPC Congress demanded to accelerate the opening 
up of Bohai Bay. However, the Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Cangzhou, 
and Shijiazhuang open zones in the province have not yet made 
great breakthroughs in opening up. Although relatively big 
headway has been made in opening the areas around Beijing and 
Tianjin to other domestic areas, it has just confined to a part 
of counties, cities, and prefectures. Considerably more 
counties, cities, and prefectures have not yet established 
cooperative relations with Beijing and Tianjin. Now, the 
province's work concerning foreign economic relations is just at 
the beginning stage, the foreign trade work has stagnated over 
the past few years, and the work concerning foreign economic 
relations has fallen to the bottom. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: Although there are many reasons 
for the little progress and the poor results in the province's 
opening up, a most important reason, when viewed from the 
results of the current observation to Shandong, Jiangsu, and 
Zhejiang provinces, is that our province has regarded the 
opening up and the development of export-oriented economy as the 
matters of some foreign economic departments instead of 
regarding them as the strategic matters that have a bearing on 
the overall situation of the economy and bring along the 
development of the entire economy, and that the province is 
still affected by "left" ideas and tied by many outmoded 
concepts, has not done enough in emancipating the mind, and has 
lacked courage and vigor in opening to the outside world, in 
utilizing foreign funds and technology, and in developing 
export- oriented economy. In addition, opening to the outside 
world, actively utilizing foreign funds and technology, and 
developing export-oriented economy have not yet become the 
identical action of all localities, all professions and trades, 
and all fields. Economic construction departments and the 
overwhelming majority of enterprises have not yet readjusted 
their structures, improved their quality, and linked their 
products with the world markets in line with the demands of the 
world markets and with the demand of participating in the 
competition on the world markets. 
  All levels of governments and all departments have not done 
enough in consciously rendering economic service to utilization 
of foreign funds and to development of foreign economic 
relations and trade. Foreign trade departments have not yet 
truly set forth the correct idea of organizing domestic 
production in line with the demand of the world market to bring 
along the development of domestic economy. Such a situation 
must be changed rapidly. Cheng Weigao stressed: Building an 
economically strong province, we must first build a province 
strong in opening up. Therefore, through this rally, all 
localities and all departments should, by discussing the report 
of Chen Liyou, examine and analyze their opening up situation 
over the past two years, summarize experiences and lessons, 
strengthen their respective planning, and strive to emancipate 
the mind and accelerate the pace of opening up and the 
development of export-oriented economy in this year and in the 
next two years. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Cangzhou, and 
Shijiazhuang, that are around Bohai Bay, should conduct a 
conscientious study and make best possible use of their 
advantages to make a big breakthrough in opening up. The 
province should effect a rapid progress in utilizing foreign 
funds and in developing foreign trade and foreign economic 
relations. All prefectures and cities and all professions and 
trades should strive to achieve new results in opening up. 
  At the conclusion of the rally, Ye Liansong dwelt on the 
opinions on the work of opening up.

<F P=106> [Speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial </F>
CPC Committee, at the provincial forum of personages of various 
circles on marking Comrade Mao Zedong's 100th birthday sponsored 
by the provincial party committee at the Xibaipo Memorial Hall 
Square on 25 December] 
  [Text] The provincial party committee held a forum of 
personages of various circles to ceremoniously mark Comrade Mao 
Zedong's 100th birthday. In their speeches, comrades, with deep 
feelings, extolled Comrade Mao's outstanding contributions, 
spoke highly of the party's experiences in inheriting and 
developing Chairman Mao's great causes gained since the third 
plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, and looked 
forward to the Chinese nation's bright future in the 21st 
century. So, I profoundly experienced their deep love and 
esteem of Chairman Mao. I think that anyone who is growing up 
from old China understands that the motherland turned itself 
gradually from a state of being enslaved and devastated to a 
rich and powerful country, and recalls the great leader 
pioneering the cause of revolution and construction. 
  There are only seven years remaining until the end of the 
20th century. As far as the Chinese nation is concerned, the 
20th century was not only a gravely disastrous century, but also 
one in which to create brilliance again. In the first half of 
the century before 1949, China overthrew the rule of 
imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and created 
the fighting history of new China. In the latter half of the 
century, the Chinese people worked arduously to pioneer 
undertakings and explored ways to build, consolidate, and 
develop the history of socialism. We cannot divorce ourselves 
from the name of Mao Zedong when reviewing these two arduous and 
brilliant sections of history. 
  China was confronted with two historical tasks in modern 
times: One was national independence and the liberation of the 
people. The other was to make the country powerful. Comrade 
Mao Zedong struggled all his lifetime to fulfill these two 
tasks. This embodied his historical contributions. We can say 
that Comrade Mao Zedong did two great deeds during his lifetime. 
The first great deed was that he led the party and the people 
to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and 
bureaucrat-capitalism and accomplished the tasks of democratic 
revolution. Proceeding from Chinese history and the specific 
situation of society and on the basis of summing up the 
experiences of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao 
Zedong created the theory on new democratic revolution and 
discovered the revolutionary road of encircling the cities from 
the rural areas. Comrade Mao Zedong, with gigantic theoretical 
courage, resolutely proceeded from reality, resolutely resisted 
the influence of both domestic and foreign dogmatism, gained 
experiences from setbacks and failures, and discovered the 
accurate revolutionary roads suitable to the Chinese national 
situation. As a result, China won a victory in revolution. 
This was the first great matter task by Comrade Mao Zedong 
during his lifetime. The second great task was that he made 
efforts to explore ways to build China's socialism after 
accomplishing the transformation of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Comrade Mao Zedong was one to make such 
explorations. He was the first person to acutely discover the 
malpractice and weak points of the socialist pattern of the 
Soviet Union and definitely advocated that China should have its 
own way of building socialism. To this end, he guided the 
Chinese people to arduously explore and took extremely tortuous 
roads. He left many brilliant ideas through these exploration 
courses, and these ideas are still of important guiding 
significance. 
  We may say that Comrade Mao Zedong left us with an 
unaccomplished will of making the country strong and the people 
rich. He failed to see with his own eyes the fruitful results 
of his undertakings of exploration and creation. The 
undertakings left unaccomplished are being realized with the 
efforts of CPC members, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their 
representative. On the basis of summing up, according to the 
principle of seeking truth from facts, both positive and 
negative experiences and lessons gained since the founding of 
the PRC and in line with the new practical experiences, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping, with gigantic theoretical courage, defined that 
our country's socialist system is still in the "initial stage," 
set forth a series of policies and principles for reform, and 
summarized these policies and principles into the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic 
line of "one center and two basic points," and finally found the 
road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that Mao 
Zedong failed to find at that time. This is the only way for 
developing socialist China and the way for China to seek 
prosperity and stand among various nations in the world. 
Through the arduous efforts of the people of the whole country 
in the past 15 years, our country's gross national product has 
doubled and the people are striding toward the target of being 
fairly well-off. With full confidence, we can tell Comrade Mao 
Zedong that his aspiration of catching up with and surpassing 
the developed countries in the world is being realized. 
  To recall Chairman Mao's fruitful achievements, we should 
emulate Mao Zedong; inherit and develop Mao Zedong Thought; use 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to guide the work in various aspects; 
accelerate the progress of reform, opening up, and 
modernization; and ensure long-term peace, stability, and 
prosperity of the country. 
  To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study his 
thinking and work style of seeking truth from facts, proceeding 
from reality, and linking theory with practice. Comrade Mao 
Zedong had a good command of Marxism and the Chinese traditional 
culture. Foreign conventions or ancient conventions restricted 
him from exploring ways for the Chinese revolution. He always 
opposed the practice of studying theories not according to the 
Chinese socialism and the reality of the Chinese revolution. 
Early in 1930, he opposed book worship and stressed that 
without investigations there would be no right to speak. The 
greatest reality we are confronted with now is to promote the 
large-scale development of socialist productive forces through 
the setup of the socialist market economic system. As far as 
our province is concerned, we should grasp favorable 
opportunities, intensify reform, expand the scale of opening up, 
speed up the pace of development, and strive to build the 
province into an economically powerful province. As a large 
province near Beijing, Hebei will be unworthy of not only its 63 
million people, but also Comrade Mao Zedong's cordial concern 
with and earnest aspirations for Hebei during his lifetime, if 
we are unable to make a faster development or continue to widen 
the gaps with advanced provinces and municipalities. So, we 
should go deep to the forefront of reform and development, exert 
efforts to study the new situation, and use the new ideas and 
methods that are suitable to the requirements of the market 
economy to solve various kinds of complicated problems relating 
to deep-layered reform work. We should thoroughly change the 
mental state of sticking to old conventions, remaining undecided 
or adopting a wait-and-see attitude when faced with favorable 
opportunities, and being blindly self- satisfied in the course 
of development. The broad masses of cadres in the province 
should actually form a brand-new outlook of seeking truth from 
facts and emancipating the mind. 
  To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study Mao 
Zedong's thinking of sharing woe and weal with the people and 
serving the people wholeheartedly. Mao Zedong often exhorted 
that the whole party was the vanguard of the proletariat, 
existed and fought for the interests of the people, and was 
always a small part of the people; and that once the party was 
divorced from the people, it would fail to realize its ideals 
and its struggles would become meaningless. On the eve of the 
victory in democratic revolution, Mao Zedong predicted that 
there would be dangers of being divorced from the masses within 
the party. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's exhortation 
to the whole party when he was in Xibaipo and continue to 
maintain the style of being modest and prudent and guarding 
against arrogance and rashness. 
  We should continue to maintain the style of arduous 
struggle, 
always take root among the masses, always persist in the purpose 
of serving the people wholeheartedly, and make unswerving 
efforts to fundamentally improve party style and social practice. 
  To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study the 
spirit of bravely exploring and arduously doing pioneering work 
as advocated and practiced by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong constantly 
regarded the world as an endless development course and took his 
own undertakings as a course of continuous exploration and 
pursuit. He was never satisfied with existing achievements and 
constantly regarded existing achievements as a starting point 
for his new explorations and pioneering work. We can say that 
Mao Zedong made ceaseless efforts to make explorations and do 
pioneering work during his lifetime. Some of his explorations 
became brilliant historical contributions; and some became 
precious ideological heritage in the form of experiences and 
lessons and also guided us to make wider and deeper explorations 
and do pioneering work today. The Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is just the result 
and fruit of the explorations in the past 10 years or so. Our 
purpose to study the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping is to make better new explorations and do 
new pioneering work. The year 1994 will arrive soon. Next year 
will be a key year to comprehensively reform the economic system 
and speed up the setup of the socialist market economic system, 
as well as to satisfactorily fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
and quadruple the gross national product ahead of schedule. So, 
we should grasp the new favorable opportunity of reform and 
development and adopt a fighting attitude to devote ourselves to 
the great exploration and pioneering undertaking. 
  Comrades: Let us inherit and develop the undertakings 
pioneered by Mao Zedong, persistently take Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as guidance, ceaselessly keep forging ahead, and 
capture a new victory in reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Chen Li (7115 0500): "The Regional Party </F>
Committee Holds a Forum of Nonparty Personages To Solicit Their 
Opinions"] 
  [Text] On 15 December, the regional party committee held a 
forum of nonparty personages to extensively solicit their 
opinions on the main subject of accelerating the pace of reform, 
opening up and economic development and striving to realize the 
grand objective of "entering the front rank" which will be 
discussed at the forthcoming eighth enlarged plenary session of 
the fifth regional party committee. 
  Comrade Wang Qun presided over the forum. Qian Fenyong and 
Zhang Zuocai attended the forum. 
  Responsible persons of democratic parties and of the 
Federation of Industry and Commerce and nonparty personages 
talked and aired their views freely on the policy decisions 
mentioned in the report on the main subject to be discussed at 
the forthcoming eighth plenary session of the fifth regional 
party committee. 
  In a harmonious atmosphere, Comrade Wang Qun and the 
participants jointly discussed the issues of common concern. He 
said in his speech: United front work is one of the magic 
weapons of our party. We should develop it in a better manner. 
This is a strategic issue, not a technical one. We must 
promote the political advantage of multiparty cooperation, the 
wisdom of various democratic parties and the information 
advantage, pool the wisdom and efforts of all, work with one 
heart and one mind and successfully carry out the work of the 
autonomous region. 
  In his summing-up speech, Comrade Wang Qun noted: Next year 
is a crucial year. The implementation of the "decision" of the 
third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee has 
indicated that our country has entered a new stage in carrying 
out the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. After 15 
years of reform and opening up our region, like other places in 
the country, it has achieved tremendous achievements in all 
fields of work. The 15 years of practice has proven that reform 
and opening up is our sole correct choice. In the coming year, 
we must try it and go ahead daringly and expand the degree of 
reform. It is not realistic to stop halfway or retreat or slow 
down our pace in reform. The only thing we should do is to 
unswervingly accelerate reform and development and to rapidly 
and thoroughly change the planned economic system into the 
socialist market economic system. This is a road of development 
and a bright one, representing the fundamental interests of the 
people of various nationalities. We have conditions and 
certainty of doing our work well. But we should also recognize 
the problems and difficulties. Because reform in the banking, 
financial, taxation, pricing and foreign trade aspects will 
inevitably involve the adjustment of interests in various 
aspects and some unfair distribution methods formed in the past. 
Perhaps, it may also arouse ideological problems of one kind or 
another and some related issues concerning the reform strength. 
Therefore, we hope that comrades of various democratic parties 
will make common efforts, do a good job in propaganda and 
guidance, use the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 
14th party Central Committee to unify the thinking of people of 
various nationalities and various democratic parties, keep eyes 
on long-term interests, the interests of the whole and the 
fundamental interests, properly handle the relations of reform, 
development and stability and do a good job in ideological work 
and promoting unity. Wang Qun pointed out: Opposing 
corruption, promoting honesty and accelerating reform should be 
united. If we fail to do a good job in fighting corruption and 
promoting honesty, reform and opening up will be unable to 
successfully carry out. In addition to striving for achieving 
expected results in the anticorruption struggle, we should also 
make long-term and unremitting efforts to grasp this work. In 
the complicated anticorruption struggle, we must be soberly 
minded, solve problems according to their merits, seek truth 
from facts and grasp this work in a down-to-earth manner. It is 
hoped that all democratic parties will give help and supervision 
to this work. 
  Comrade Wang Qun also called for efforts to fully absorb the 
opinions of the people and make revisions on the report 
concerning the main subject to be discussed at the forthcoming 
eighth plenary session of the fifth regional party committee. 
At the same time, the problems on the purchase of cars, 
subjectivism, overlapping construction reflected by the 
participants at the forum should be made known in the form of 
issuing bulletins so that they can be rapidly solved. 
  Wang Chongwen, Chen Jie and Xu Bonian, vice chairmen of the 
regional committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, also attended the forum.

  [Text] A boat carrying Vietnamese refugees sailed for 
Japan from the northern Taiwan shore Thursday [6 January] after 
the military employees replenished it with fresh food, water, 
and fuel. The Vietnamese boat with 24 men, women, and children 
on board have been drifting on the sea for three months before 
it forced its way into a fishing port in Hsinchu at 0630 a.m. 
Thursday. The boat has tried to enter the port on Wednesday 
night but was refused by the military who detected it from the 
radar screen. The Vietnamese captain requested that he and his 
passengers be allowed to stay in Taiwan for a few days before 
the weather became stable. But the military employees turned 
down the appeal. Instead, local authorities supplied the vessel 
with fresh water, food, and fuel to continue its trip.

  [Text] A ranking trade official said that it will probably 
take two more years before the government will allow the 
importation of finished products manufactured in Mainland China. 
Currently the government allows the importation of 1,664 
merchandise items from the mainland. The government has sought 
to limit the impact of cheap mainland products on the Island's 
economy by allowing only semi-finished products to be imported. 
  According to the Economic Affairs Ministry, the ROC 
[Republic 
of China] is considering lifting import restriction on mainland 
products. Over the next two years, the number of permitted 
imported products may increase from the current 1,664 to 5,000. 
In addition, once the 5,000 target has been reached, a 
recommendation will be made to the Cabinet that the list of 
permitted imports be dropped in favor of a list of banned 
imports. The ministry estimated that this year, Taiwan's total 
imports from the mainland will grow more than 20 percent.

  [Text] The ROC's [Republic of China] inflation rate edged 
down to 2.9 percent last year, the lowest since 1988. Officials 
said the low inflation rate came about despite a 4.6 percent 
price hike recorded in December. The rise was the highest 
recorded in a single month over the last 14 months and was 
caused mainly by sharp increases in vegetable prices. Officials 
attributed 1993's low inflation to four main factors: first, 
the absence of major typhoons, which kept fruit and vegetable 
prices stable throughout the year; second, the marginal rise in 
wages and rents; third, the declining world oil prices; and 
fourth, prices of industrial raw materials remain low. 
Officials predicted that prices would remain stable this year, 
citing the lowering of import tariffs in preparation for 
Taipei's admission into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, or GATT.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Tang Shubei, </F>
vice-chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait: "15-Year Progress in Ties Across Taiwan Strait"] 
  [Text] The relationship between the Chinese mainland and 
Taiwan has witnessed a gradual detente in the past 15 years 
thanks to the practical and flexible policies adopted by both 
sides. 
  The Wang-Koo Talks last April, involving the heads of the 
non- governmental Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS) of the mainland and the Straits Exchange 
Foundation of Taiwan (SEF), ushered in a new era in the 
relations between the two sides. 
  At the end of last year, a break-through was made when 
leading negotiators from ARATS arrived in Taiwan and talked with 
their counterparts with the SEF. 
  It was the first time since the People's Republic was 
founded 
in 1949 that members of the mainland non-governmental 
organization landed on the island, bringing a New Year gift to 
compatriots across the Taiwan Strait as well as overseas Chinese. 
  Even before the political detente, economic ties between the 
two sides were improve greatly. 
  Taiwan businessmen are running about 10,000 companies and 
enterprises on the mainland with a contract value of $10 
billion. By the end of 1992, bilateral trade amounted to $29 
billion. 
  Other kinds of exchanges have also become more frequent, 
ending the grievous situation of no communication due to 
military confrontation 15 years ago. Over the years, 1 million 
people have crossed the Strait. 
  Relaxation of tension across the Strait began with the 
mainland's publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" 
on January 1, 1979. 
  At that time, the mainland had shifted its main task to 
economic development. And the international status of China had 
been greatly improved as the country set up diplomatic relations 
with the United States on January 1, 1979. 
  The message says the Chinese mainland is trying to solve the 
reunification issue by peaceful measures rather than by military 
force. 
  The strategic message has formed the basis for establishing 
a 
new type of relation between the mainland and Taiwan, said Tang 
Shubei, Vice-Chairman of ARATS, in the weekly magazine Outlook. 
  The mainland advocated direct exchanges of mail, trade, and 
air and shipping services as well as those of personnel, culture 
and sports across the Strait. 
  These proposals met the needs of compatriots across the 
Strait and were welcomed by them, Tang said. 
  Jiang Dianming, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 
shares Tang's view. He said that publication of the message 
showed the practical attitude of the mainland on the issue of 
reunification. 
  Also, the message showed that the mainland respected the 
status quo of the island and the will of its people. And the 
mainland guaranteed that Taiwan would not suffer economically 
after reunification, Jiang said. 
  Great changes have taken place in the relations across the 
Taiwan Strait since the publication of the message. 
  In 1981, Ye Jianying, then Chairman of the Standing 
Committee 
of the National People's Congress, reiterated the mainland's 
policy on Taiwan, stressing that Taiwan would enjoy high 
autonomy as a special administrative zone of the People's 
Republic after reunification. 
  Senior leader Deng Xiaoping perfected the policy with his 
"one country, two systems" composition in 1984. Within his 
framework, once the country is unified the mainland would 
continue its socialist system while Taiwan maintains its 
capitalism. 
  In response to the mainland's flexible measures, Taiwan 
authorities announced in August 1987 that residents of the 
island would be allowed to visit their relatives on the mainland. 
  It was a positive step, further relaxing the confrontation 
across the Strait. Since then, thousands of Taiwan residents 
have been swarming to the mainland to visit relatives or tour 
places of interest. Such visits have promoted indirect trade 
and investment across the Strait. 
  To reduce friction and disputes, the non-governmental SEF 
and 
ARATS were set up in 1990 and 1991, opening a high-level 
negotiation channel across the Strait. 
  However, problems still hamper the growth of co-operation. 
  The indirect exchanges have proven time-consuming. And the 
Taiwan authorities have placed many obstacles and restrictions 
in the way of exchanges. 
  Another common task for both sides is to unswervingly oppose 
those advocating the "independence of Taiwan" and oppose any 
activities aimed at undermining the country's sovereignty. The 
two sides should sit down to hold more talks concerning issues 
related to reunification, Tang Shubei said. 
  On the premise of the one-China principle and on the basis 
of 
equality and common ground while reserving differences, there 
are always solutions to the problems, said Tang. 
  Further contacts across the Taiwan Strait in the new year 
are 
needed to promote the progress of the peaceful reunification of 
the country. 
  Lu Jiaxi, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
NPC, 
has urged the two sides to strengthen scientific co-operation, 
especially in high and new technology. 
  This will be helpful for reunification and will benefit the 
world on the whole, Lu said.

  [Text] During his recent inspection in Qiandongnan 
Autonomous Prefecture, provincial Secretary Liu Fangren 
emphasized: Party committees and governments at all levels, 
broad ranks of party members, and the broad masses must 
conscientiously study the thrust of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and of the national economic work 
conference, further emancipate the mind, renew concepts, and 
broaden the mind, make meticulous efforts to organize the 
implementation of reform measures, and speed up development of 
the economy. 
  Liu Fangren said: Party committees and governments at all 
levels must uphold the basic line of "one center, two basic 
points," seek truth from facts, seize opportunities, and quicken 
the pace of development. They should adopt the idea of moving 
ahead as fast as possible, forging ahead bravely, and being 
courageous enough to do pioneering work. In the course of 
deepening reform, they should help advance the overall process, 
strive to make breakthroughs at key points, integrate theory 
with practice, apply various economic policies properly and 
flexibly, make substantial efforts to seize opportunities and 
strive to gain the initiative, and seek development while 
overcoming difficulties. 
  Liu Fangren said: Today, the gap between eastern and western 
regions is widening. A poor region like Guizhou Province should 
have a sense of urgency. We must adopt and firmly establish in 
our mind the idea of macroagriculture and develop the rural 
economy in an all-round way. While not relaxing grain 
production, we should vigorously develop diversified economic 
operations, township and town enterprises, animal husbandry, and 
courtyard economy. We must actively use the noncultivated land 
resources to optimum results, conduct farming properly, and try 
to reclaim more farmland from mountains. In organizing the 
implementation of reform measures, we must subject local to 
overall and immediate to long-term interests, handle well the 
relationship among reform, development, and stability, and 
create a fine environment for economic development. We must make 
a good job of the grass-roots organization building in rural 
areas, focusing on the building of party branches, so that for 
each village, a good party branch secretary is selected, a good 
leadership group set up, and a road to prosperity found. It is 
necessary to establish a scientific management system and do a 
good job in the [words indistinct] activity, so that this 
activity can be brought to a new height. 
  Liu Fangren also emphasized that in the future, when 
assessing the performance of leading cadres of the autonomous 
prefecture and counties, we should, first, look at the growth 
rate of revenue in the specific locality; second, find out how 
much peasant per-capita net income has grown; and third, find 
out how well party and spiritual civilization building have been 
conducted.

  [Text] While inspecting Yanan Prefecture from 26 to 28 
December, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie stressed the 
need to conscientiously implement the proposal raised by the 
Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Provincial CPC Committee for 
the province's economic development next year, to do well in 
opening up to the world, in key agricultural construction 
projects, in enterprise reform, and in spiritual civilization. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie said: It is far from enough for Sichuan 
to rely on self-accumulation in economic construction; it must 
rely on opening up to the world and foreign investments. This 
will develop Sichuan's economy rapidly. In this respect, we 
should make a faster move and be more dynamic. All kinds of 
measures should be taken to encourage foreign investments. He 
added: The way out for Sichuan's agriculture is stabilizing 
grain production, increasing income, and striving for moderate 
prosperity. Grain production and agricultural development 
should be carried out by means of science and technology, and 
township and town enterprises should be developed. A link must 
be formed between enterprises, markets, and peasants to blaze a 
track of rural industrialization. In the course of encouraging 
development of private economic sectors, there is also a need to 
vigorously develop collective economic sectors and strengthen 
rural party organizations' coherent force and combat worthiness. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie said: Key construction projects must be 
given full attention. The 10 construction projects arranged by 
the provincial government involving Sichuan's long-term 
development must be fulfilled as scheduled. Reform of existing 
enterprises must be deepened according to the 33 regulations, a 
good job must be done in carrying out reform experiments in the 
22 enterprises selected, and experience in this respect must be 
promptly summed up and then popularized. In the meantime, 
particular attention must be paid to resolving the problem of 
loss-incurring enterprises. If this problem is not resolved 
properly, it will affect stability and unity. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie stressed: We must do two kinds of work 
simultaneously and lay equal stress on them and make a success 
of spiritual civilization. Leading cadres should set strict 
demands on themselves, curb corruption, improve 
grass-roots-level organizations for social order, and help 
protect social order so as to spend the New Year and the Spring 
Festival happily.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese foreign trade 
saw an increase of 18.2 percent last year, reaching 195.7 
billion U.S. dollars, with a deficit of over 12 billion U.S. 
dollars, according to statistics issued by China's customs 
department today. 
  In 1993, China's imports grew by 29 percent over 1992, 
amounting to 103.95 billion U.S. dollars; exports increased by 8 
percent, reaching 91.77 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Textiles and garments still topped the exports list, 
recording a 7.2 percent lift with a total volume of 27.13 
billion U.S. dollars, while machinery and electronics witnessed 
a steady rise of 16.1 percent, totalling 22.7 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  Machinery and electronics also made up a nearly-half share 
of 
the imports, to the tune of 49.46 billion U.S. dollars, a steep 
rise of 41.7 percent and including cars, aircraft, telephone 
sets and telephone switchboards as well as machinery for 
textiles, construction, mining, metal processing and rubber and 
plastics processing. 
  Imports of raw materials and fuel also witnessed a large 
growth, in which steel imports jumped to over 30 million tons, 
up 327 percent, processed oil hit 17.48 million tons, up 128 
percent. 
  The import and export of foreign-financed enterprises 
continued to rise sharply, with a total export of 25.24 billion 
U.S. dollars, representing a 45.4 percent increase and 
accounting for 27.5 percent of China's total exports; and an 
import of 41.83 billion U.S. dollars, increased by 58.6 percent, 
covering 40.2 percent of China's imports. 
  These foreign-funded enterprises shipped as much as 16.63 
billion U.S. dollars of equipment, increased by 107 percent. 
  In volume, China's biggest trade partners are Japan, Hong 
Kong, the United States, the European Community, Taiwan, 
Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Australia and Canada. 
  In 1993, Japan imported 15.79 billion U.S. dollars worth 
from 
China while exporting 23.25 billion U.S. dollars worth to it. 
Hong Kong consumed 22.06 billion U.S. dollars worth of China's 
exports and provided it with goods worth 10.48 billion U.S. 
dollars. The United States imported 16.96 billion U.S. dollars 
worth from China, and its exports to China were worth 10.69 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  In 1993, China's export growth rate was the lowest since 
1986, while the import growth rate was the highest since 1986. 
  The reasons for the result included the domestic economy's 
high growth rate; large-scale investment; thriving market 
demand; lack of some commodities, especially primary products 
due to the rising domestic prices; meanwhile, imports of raw 
materials and energy which met soaring domestic demand, and 
machinery and telecommunications facilities increased by large 
amounts. 
  Equipment imported by China's foreign-funded enterprises 
also 
contributed to China's rapid increase of imports and huge trade 
deficit, as China drew more overseas investment last year. 
  Besides, the imports increase can also be attributed to 
China's bid to lower import tariffs last year. 
  It is predicted that with the reform of China's trade system 
and foreign exchange system this year, China's export volume in 
1994 is expected to exceed 100 billion U.S. dollars and its 
import growth rate is to slow down.

<F P=106> [By Wei Ling: Hard Currency Trading Remains Sluggish] </F>
  [Text] Trading in foreign exchange swap markets across 
China was flat last week, the first after the unification of the 
dual-track foreign exchange system. 
  There was little fluctuation in prices and transactions were 
small. 
  Experts say suppliers and buyers are becoming more prudent 
and adopting a wait-and-see attitude to the market. 
  However, they said the cautious response at least helped 
diminish decision-makers' worries about big ups and downs in 
exchange rates after unification. 
  And although the swap markets are to be gradually phased out 
with the establishment of the inter-bank exchange market, their 
prices are still important references for the central bank to 
set basic exchange rates. 
  In addition, since foreign exchange trading between banks 
and 
enterprises is just beginning, the swap markets are now the main 
regulators of money supply between banks. 
  The only traders on the markets now are specialized banks 
and 
some non-banking financial institutions. This is because 
businesses which used to trade on the market have had to 
withdraw. 
  The U.S. dollar opened at 8.7 yuan on Monday at the Beijing 
Foreign Exchange Swap market and closed at 8.7060 yuan on 
Thursday [6 January]. 
  The week's lowest price for U.S. dollars was 8.61 yuan in 
Henan Foreign Exchange Swap Market on Monday and the highest was 
8.725 yuan on Friday in Tianjin. 
  The Hong Kong dollar opened 1.125 yuan in Hainan and 1.118 
yuan in Shenzhen on Monday and closed 1.125 and 1.121 yuan 
respectively on Friday.

<F P=106> [By Jin Min: "Fresh Move To Boost Trade"] </F>
  [Text] China will work to achieve a near balance of 
imports and exports this year, Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Co-operation Wu Yi said last week. 
  She said the country's foreign trade volume would be about 
$200 billion by the end of the year, a steady increase from the 
$190 billion projected for 1993. 
  China was gripped by an import boom last year that inflated 
the country's trade deficit to around $10 billion. 
  Meanwhile, China's exports were put in a spot by higher 
export costs and a more profitable domestic market. 
  The 13 percent growth rate in China's gross domestic product 
last year was the main cause of the import spree, which in part 
triggered the devaluation of renminbi yuan at the country's swap 
markets. 
  The State-decreed foreign exchange rate at swap markets was 
$1 to 8.7 yuan (compared to the official rate of $1 to 5.7 
yuan), but the actual rate plummeted to $1 to 10.86 yuan last 
June. 
  By then, the bulk of China's hard currency trading had been 
dominated by the swap market prices. 
  So Chinese foreign trade companies faced higher purchasing 
prices for exports. 
  At the same time, exports were hit as Chinese companies 
chose 
to trade in the booming domestic market and avoid the relatively 
sluggish international one. 
  Economists said slower economic development in 1994 and a 
healthier foreign exchange rate system will help China balance 
its foreign trade.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 8 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai Customs 
Office has become China's largest cargo handler as it handled 
imports and exports worth a total of 30.9 billion U.S. dollars 
in 1993. 
  Cao Hengli, director of the Shanghai Customs Office, said 
that imports via the Shanghai port, the largest of its kind in 
China, shot up nearly 29 percent in 1993 to 16.95 billion U.S. 
dollars, while exports through Shanghai climbed almost 17 
percent to 13.98 billion U.S. dollars. 
  He described the growth in international container 
transportation via Shanghai as the most "impressive." the port 
handled a total of 901,000 standard containers last year, 
roughly up by 58 percent. 
  For the first time, the number of people leaving and 
entering 
China via Shanghai topped the two million mark in 1993, at a 
record 2.53 million, Cao said. 
  "We did everything in our power to assist the development 
and 
construction of the Pudong New Area and the Waigaoqiao Free 
Trade Zone, to boost exports from Shanghai, and to accelerate 
infrastructure construction and growth of new- and 
high-technology industries." 
  For example, procedures for customs declarations and tariff 
reductions and exemptions were simplified last year. 
  To date, Shanghai, China's leading manufacturing center, has 
formed eight bonded enterprise groups, 187 bonded factories and 
297 bonded warehouses, the director said. 
  Moreover, the Shanghai Customs Office continued to crack 
down 
on all kinds of smuggling activities in 1993, he said. 
  Last year, the office cleared up 526 smuggling cases 
involving smuggled goods worth a total of 222 million yuan 
(about 25 million U.S. dollars). 
  Cao Hengli pledged to step up reforms in passenger 
inspection, ship inspection and bonded goods handling in the new 
year.

<F P=106> [by Zhou Zongmin and Yao Datian] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- China has made 
remarkable progress in importing advanced technology and 
equipment for 210 key state projects involving such major areas 
as transport, telecommunications and raw materials. 
  This was announced by Zhang Xiaoqiang, deputy director of 
the 
foreign funds department under the State Planning Commission 
(SPC), in an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today. 
  Zhang said that so far contracts have been worked out or 
signed to import technology, equipment and key materials for 47 
projects. And 20 more projects are in the process of bidding or 
business negotiations. 
  China announced the huge import package for the last seven 
years of the 1990s in June 1993, with a total fund expected to 
reach 30 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The package covers 23 sectors and trades including 
agriculture, energy, transport, telecommunications, machinery, 
electronics, chemicals, metallurgy, light industry and textiles. 
A majority of the 210 major technology projects are in 
infrastructures and basic industries, areas that the Chinese 
Government has decided to give priority in their development. 
  According to Zhang, on the import bills will be complete 
sets 
of equipment, key facilities, accessory meters and instruments, 
as well as state-of-the art technologies. Financial sources for 
the purchases include state foreign exchange reserves, 
fund-raising by departments and local governments concerned, 
international commercial loans and loans provided by foreign 
governments or international lending institutions. 
  The SPC official said all these projects have been approved 
by the government and have been listed in the state plan. 
  The 47 contracts that have been concluded include a 
120-million-U.S. dollar order of manufacturing equipment from 
the Japanese Sanyo Company for the "Nylon 66 Salt Project" in 
Henan Province, central China, and a 17-million-dollar order to 
import key equipment from the United States for a forestry 
project in north China's Hebei province. 
  Also included is an agreement between China and the Siemens 
Company of Germany on importing locomotives and equipment worth 
400 million U.S. dollars for the Guangzhou Subway Project. 
  The publicity of major technology importing projects has 
aroused wide interest among foreign businessmen, who said that 
the move helped them know better about China's foreign trade 
policy and offered authoritative and practical information on 
trading with China, especially on major technology purchases. 
  The move will also facilitate China's technical renovation 
and infrastructural building, said Zhang. 
  According to a 10-year development blueprint for the period 
from 1991 to 2000, China's gross domestic product (GDP) will 
maintain an eight to nine percent annual growth rate in the 
years. 
  To this end, Chinese leaders said the country should more 
effectively cash in on the international market, capital, 
technology and resources to keep the growth rate of foreign 
trade higher than that of GDP. 
  The government has decided to rationally readjust the import 
structure so that more will be spent on introducing advanced 
technology and key equipment for basic industries and 
infrastructures. 
  Zhang said that China's domestic market is huge. Imports 
have kept expanding and legal guarantee is being improved. 
  The Chinese Government is ready to create a more favorable 
environment for foreign businessmen and continue to give details 
about technology import projects, he said.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Xiao Rui (5618 3843): "Industry </F>
Sector of China's Economy Reenters the `Fast Lane'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The State 
Statistics Bureau has recently disclosed that in December 1993, 
the industrial sector of China's economy rebounded rapidly. The 
growth rate reached as high as 29.8 percent, nearly 11 
percentage points over the previous month, and was close to the 
highest point before macroregulation and control were exercised. 
  The main causes of the rapid growth rate in industrial 
production in December 1993 were: First, the implementation of 
the easy money policy beginning in November injected working 
funds into many enterprises which were experiencing difficulties 
caused by the shortage of funds so that these enterprises were 
able to speed up their production; second, at the end of last 
year, various localities tried all means to accelerate the 
production progress in a bid to increase the base figures in the 
upcoming tax sharing reform. 
  The super high speed operation of the industrial sector of 
the economy last year was a necessity but it also caused people 
to worry that the excessive growth in industrial production 
would inevitably bring about various tense economic relations 
again and cause a deterioration in the tense supply-demand 
situation in "bottleneck" sectors. 
  According to reports, the annual growth in industrial 
production in 1993 was 23.6 percent higher than the previous 
year and was the highest level in the 15 years of reform and 
opening up. Nongovernment owned enterprises continued to occupy 
a leading position in the economic growth and their increased 
output value accounted for 77.7 percent of the total newly 
increased output value. The production development of coastal 
areas was markedly faster than that of the hinterland. The six 
provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and 
Hainan, whose annual growth rate exceeded 30 percent, are all 
located along the southeast coast. 
  Viewed from the cycle of economic development, 1994 will 
undoubtedly be a year with a medium to high rate of growth. The 
domestic demands remain high, the investment scales in projects 
under construction and carry-over investment are big, and the 
readjustment in workers' wages will also give impetus to the 
consumer goods market. On the other hand, various localities 
will double their output ahead of schedule and this, together 
with their strong aspirations to push the economy to a higher 
level, will promote the industrial production to continue to 
glide forward on the platform of a high speed growth rate in the 
fourth quarter of 1993. It is estimated that the production 
growth in the first quarter of this year will reach over 15 
percent. 
  Authoritative people in economic circles have already 
predicted that China's economy will have a relatively vigorous 
rise again in the first few months of 1994 and hold that it is 
necessary to implement, at the proper time, a relatively tight 
financial policy to prevent the economy from becoming 
"overheated" again. 
  The year 1994 is a "year of reform" in China. In order to 
prevent some hidden unstable factors from being intensified and 
from becoming obstacles in the process of reform, economic 
specialists have warned against blindly seeking an excessively 
high growth rate and have called for making greater efforts in 
structural readjustment so that the industrial sector of the 
economy can develop appropriately and healthily.

<F P=106> ["3rd Stage of China's Reform Seen as Crucial"] </F>
  [Text] Having carried out its economic reform and 
opening-up programme for 15 years, China is turning from 
individual reform steps to establishing a sound overall economic 
relationship, says an article in Chinese Business Times. The 
present stage is crucial, says the article. 
  As the country's traditional highly centralized economic 
system is being dismantled and a market economy is shaping up, 
economic management is undergoing changes. 
  Different forms of ownership now co-exist, with State-owned 
industries playing a dominant role. 
  Market forces are deciding the distribution of materials and 
output of enterprises. 
  The government is using economic and legal measures instead 
of the traditional mandatory plans to regulate the country's 
economy. 
  However, as conflicts and friction between the old and new 
economic systems frequently occur, the achievements gained by 
reform are being nibbled away by negative elements. 
  One of the most eye-catching problems is that some 
government 
administrative organizations are involved in running businesses, 
causing chaos in management, incurring losses of State 
properties, widening the income gap and bringing about 
corruption. 
  Meanwhile, enterprises are often ordered, under different 
pretexts, to pay various funds, fees and donations. 
  Random collection of funds, coupled with the boom in 
non-governmental financial institutions, is burdening the 
reforms because China still lacks laws and regulations to 
standardize economic and financial activities. 
  The article in China Business Times says it is time to solve 
the major problems in the reform and set up a sound economic 
relationship. 
  Successful reform measures should be continued and new 
packages should be drafted and put into effect in line with the 
new circumstances, says the article. 
  At the same time, the reform should be given more 
theoretical 
direction. Traditional exploratory measures are not enough. 
  The article says that China's economic reform has 
experienced 
two stages in the past 15 years. 
  During the first stage, between 1979 and 1984, the country 
tried hard to find reasonable measures for economic reform. 
  While the exploration proved fruitful, many new problems 
emerged and mistakes were made due to the lack of experience. 
  The second stage, between 1985 and 1991, witnessed the 
co-existence of exploratory measures and policy direction. 
  Now it is time that the country map out more policies to 
guide the reform efficiently and equitably, the article says. 
Overall policies should be introduced for the establishment of 
the socialist market economy. 
  When mapping out new reform packages, market needs and 
China's distinctive features should be taken as the major 
concerns. 
  The article said the country's reform policies carried out 
in 
the past 15 years mainly originated from the practice of the 
masses. 
  The two significant examples were the rural family contract 
responsibility system and the shareholding system for 
transferring management of State-owned enterprises, says the 
article. 
  As the reform deepens, policy guidance has become 
increasingly important. 
  At the same time, it is urgent that the legal system be 
perfected.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- The People's 
Construction Bank of China has announced that its savings in 
individual renminbi accounts reached 158.4 billion yuan (about 
21 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993, a record for the bank. 
  Last year, the bank's total increase in individual savings 
was 50.5 billion yuan, roughly equal to total increases between 
1986 and 1990. 
  Since the beginning of last year, the bank, which is mainly 
in charge of issuing loans for major state construction 
projects, has done unprecedentedly brisk business in personal 
savings. 
  Bank officials attributed the achievements to the contract 
system carried out in a bid to bring the workers' enthusiasm 
into full play. 
  Taking advantage of the Central People's Bank raising 
interest rates in May and July last year, the construction bank 
held a 100-day savings promotion program from July 11 to October 
20, 1993. The effort resulted in an increase of 22.5 billion 
yuan in personal savings.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Protection of Women Workers Urged"] </F>
  [Text] Improved working conditions are a top priority in 
the protection of women's rights as China speeds toward 
industrialization. 
  Despite overall improvement in the working environment for 
women, problems have recurred, especially in sectors where there 
is less State surveillance, such as some township, private 
enterprises and joint ventures. 
  China now boasts one of the world's most complete legal 
codes 
regarding working conditions for women, according to Yang 
Yuchen, official from the Women Workers Department under the 
All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). 
  The code consists of the Regulation on Women's Labour 
Security, the Regulation on Women's Labour Contraindication and 
the Regulation on Women Workers' Health Care. 
  This network of regulations ensures the physical well-being 
of women of all ages. 
  In its July survey of 2,000 enterprises, mostly State-owned, 
in 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the 
ACFTU found 94.5 percent of the business have full- or part-time 
persons hired to monitor the working conditions of employees. 
  Nearly 95 percent of the enterprises surveyed offered 
routine 
gynecological examinations for their female employees. Pregnant 
workers in 87 percent of the enterprises received prenatal 
examinations. 
  Breaks for breast-feeding and one or two-day menstruation 
leaves for women on jobs requiring heavy labour were also 
guaranteed in most enterprises. 
  However, the changing economic system often causes 
infringements of the women's rights and safety. 
  Pregnant and lactating women workers tend to be the first to 
be laid-off by employers obsessed with production efficiency. 
  Women at unprofitable and bankrupt enterprises cannot expect 
to have hospitalization for child-birth paid by their employers. 
  Workers at many foreign-invested and private businesses are 
facing an even tougher situation. 
  During the past couple years, the ACFTU has investigated 
1,058 foreign-funded and township enterprises. Nearly half did 
not grant child-birth leaves. 
  Exposure to dangerous substances, far beyond State mandated 
limits, overtime work without compensatory pay, random salary 
deductions and sexual harassment were also prevalent. 
  Some workers were even deprived of basic human rights. 
Abuses included strip searches and even an instance in which a 
woman suspected of theft being locked in a dog cage. 
  Some 59 of the 60 persons who died in a fire in a 
Taiwan-invested textile factory in Fujian Province last month 
were rural women. 
  To improve the situation, the ACFTU's Women Workers' 
Committee suggests four measures: 
  -- Disseminate information regarding the State regulations 
on 
working conditions. 
  Rural workers, as well as the heads of many township 
enterprises, are ignorant of the labour laws. 
  -- Strengthen the enforcement of existing labour 
regulations. 
In addition, the future Labour Law, which is expected to be 
submitted to the legislature this year, should stress all the 
enterprises within China must observe these laws. 
  -- Establish a labour security inspection organization that 
caters to the needs of women workers. 
  -- Speed the foundation of a social security system for 
child 
birth, in which all of the society would shoulder the cost of 
deliveries, not the individual enterprises.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "State Shifts Gears </F>
To Boost Motor Market"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government has decided new policies 
which aim to improve the domestic motor market. 
  The moves range from tax shifts on retail sales of 
domestically-made cars to new tariffs on imports. 
  A policy that for years has allowed foreign-funded 
enterprises to buy duty-free foreign cars will be withdrawn. 
  In addition, controls on institutional car buying, initiated 
by the Ministry of Finance in the 1970s, have been eased. 
  The ministry said the controls have been lifted to help 
saloon car makers. 
  The new tariffs are already effective, but regulations on 
the 
shifts of saloon car consumption taxes, which constitute 
two-thirds of the retail car price, are unavailable now. 
  And an official from an automobile trading firm believed the 
moves would have a major effect but she said it was difficult to 
predict how situation will develop as the motor market was still 
in a recession that began in July. 
  The recession, a result of the government's tight-credit 
policy and anti-corruption drive, is likely to continue until 
the second half of this year, said industry experts. 
  A senior official with the China Trade Centre for Automobile 
Imports said imports of foreign-made cars and vans, would 
certainly be down on last year's 400,000. 
  The official believed tough central government measures 
would 
stop the smuggling of foreign-made cars. 
  Customs stations are now required to confiscate smuggled 
vehicles unconditionally instead of simply imposing fines as 
they did before. 
  The Ministry of Public Security, the General Administration 
of Customs and the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce issued a joint notice that no driving licence be given 
to car owners without documents from the firm where they bought 
the car. 
  In 1993, 100,000 cars and vans were smuggled into the 
mainland. 
  Business Weekly has learned the government approved the 
duty-free sale to foreign-funded firms of a third of the 15,000 
cars and vans it bought last year. 
  The cars made by the US's General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, 
are now the last batch of duty-free cars being sold to 
foreign-funded firms. 
  In 1993, 80,000 foreign-built cars and vans were sold to 
foreign-funded enterprises duty-free, compared with 50,000 in 
1992. 
  This preferential policy is to be cancelled partly because 
some overseas-run firms profiteered by selling duty-free 
vehicles to domestic customers. 
  And some foreign-funded firms were set up for no other 
reason 
than to deal in duty-free cars. 
  The new policies are also likely to help improve the 
country's motor pricing system. 
  Just now a Chinese-made car sells for twice the price of the 
same car made overseas on the domestic market. 
  However, the official said price reform in China was 
complicated. 
  As the controls on institutional car purchases are lifted, 
sales of cars are expected to rise. 
  However, as the tight-credit and anti-corruption programmes 
continue, enterprises' purchasing power will remain low and 
government departments and institutions will lay out little cash 
in the short term.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- China plans to choose 
the best tourist cities annually from now on as an effort to 
improve the quality of services in the country's tourist 
industry. 
  "It is also aimed at upgrading China's reputation in tourist 
service both in China and the world," said a spokesman for the 
State Tourism Administration (STA). 
  The tourist cities will be appraised in terms of service 
quality, tourist response and environment, whose specific 
criteria will be published by the administration, he noted. 
  The spokesman said that a system for publicizing service 
quality will be established covering all the nation's tourist 
management bodies, with letters of complaints from tourists made 
public. 
  The bureau will also run a special program, "investigations 
of service quality hot spots," to encourage the public and news 
media to supervise service quality, the spokesman said. 
  The official said the service quality criteria will embrace 
the service offered, enterprise management and tourism 
facilities. 
  The STA also set up a special committee to formulate rules 
and regulations in order to upgrade the means of transport, 
tourist sites, foods, shopping and recreation, he said. 
  The official said professional ethics is "an important 
factor" for appraisal.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- China should raise 
the income of its 900 million farmers by every possible means, a 
top Chinese agriculture official said here today. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng, who is in charge of China's 
agriculture, said it is of strategic importance to the 
prosperous national economy to increase farmers' income in a 
stable way and ensure adequate supply of farm produce. 
  The official said China could not be well off if farmers' 
could not live a fairly comfortable life, adding that a brisk 
national market is impossible if farmers' purchasing power is 
not improved and rural markets remain low. 
  China's government has promised to give a comfortable life 
to 
its citizens by the year 2000. The goal requires the average 
annual growth rate of farmers' income be more than five percent 
during the remaining years. 
  The per capita net income of 900 million farmers for 1993 is 
estimated at 880 yuan (about 100 U.S. dollars). 
  The figure represents a real increase of about two percent 
over the previous year after inflation. 
  "Farmers' income has been growing too slowly during the past 
several years. The average annual growth rate for 1985-1992 is 
only 2.2 percent. It could be said that farmers' income has 
been fluctuating," said Chen. 
  In order to improve farmers' income, the Chinese Government 
is considering a package of measures to promote the development 
of agriculture and the rural economy. 
  The measures under consideration include more investment in 
agriculture, construction of more major grain and cotton 
production centers, improvement of the grain protection system 
for situations when the grain price is too low to be profitable, 
and faster development of township and village enterprises. 
  Statistics show that about 60 percent of farmers' net income 
has in recent years come from township and village enterprises. 
  The sustained increase of farmers' income depends 
considerably on the growth rate and efficiency of rural firms. 
  Last year the Chinese Government announced an increase of 
grain and cotton prices. 
  Chen said that efforts should be continued to supervise and 
control the financial burdens or taxes imposed on farmers. He 
stressed that it was important to prevent farmers' increased 
income being taken away from them.

  [Text] A sharp drop in the area of land farmed in China 
last year exacerbated rises in the price of grain and staple 
foods in the past two months, agriculture officials said. 
  The total area of farmland under cultivation last year fell 
by about 10 per cent. 
  Total agricultural output stood at 42.2 million tonnes, 
about 
5.19 million tonnes less than in 1992. 
  Officials said the fall in the autumn harvest was more 
marked 
in Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, where supply lagged 
far behind demand. 
  The opening up of the grain market had also led to fierce 
competition. 
  In the face of a drop in agricultural output, localities had 
raised their price offers for grain to increase their reserves. 
  "This has resulted in a continuous increase in grain 
prices," 
officials pointed out. In northeastern provinces, for example, 
the grain purchase price soared from 0.66 yuan (HK$0.59) per 
kilogram to 0.85 yuan. 
  Unlike 1992, when the state grain purchase price, or the so- 
called "protected price", was higher than market prices, 
officials said the trend was reversed last year. 
  Farmers began to hoard grain for higher prices. 
  Many of them also wanted to secure a substantial amount in 
reserve in the face of the expected drop in production this 
year, officials said. 
  As a result, the state-owned shops could not meet their 
grain-purchase targets. 
  "The rise in grain prices then went out of control," the 
officials said.

  [Text] China will take on new markets this year to expand 
its overseas labour and engineering service, a senior official 
said last week. 
  The Middle East, a magnet damaged by the Gulf War, is 
especially promising, said Chen Yongcai, director general of the 
international co-operation department at the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Co-operation. 
  "We're well prepared to enter the Iraqi market once the 
United Nations' sanctions are called off," he said. 
  There is a strong likelihood the UN will lift economic 
sanctions against Iraq within the year, analysts say. 
  China has had a number of projects in Iraq, some have had to 
be postponed because of the sanctions. 
  And in certain cases, Iraq still owes China money. 
  "We're closely following what is happening with Iraq," Chen 
said, but he declined to give details. 
  China has already regained its presence in Kuwait, which is 
emerging from the scars of the Gulf War. 
  Chen said China's labour and engineering contracts where 
were 
back at pre-Gulf War levels. 
  "We've won bids from Kuwait to build larger petrochemical 
projects," he said. 
  Other big potential markets include South Korea, Japan, 
Sudan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
  Chen believed China would get $7.5 billion worth of overseas 
labour and engineering contracts this year, 25 percent more than 
1993. 
  Business turnover would grow 12.5 percent to $4.5 billion. 
  And altogether 190,000 workers would be overseas by the end 
of the year, 30,000 more than 1993. 
  Chen said China would also seek higher-level labour and 
engineering contracts this year, including aircraft maintenance 
and project consultancy and design. 
  In the past, Chinese workers have been engaged mostly in 
infrastructure on construction projects. 
  Chen said China was also considering accepting payment in 
the 
form of oil or oil products from Middle East countries. 
  China had rejected such payment in the past, causing the 
loss 
of many contracts, Chen added. 
  He estimated the value of 1993's overseas labour and 
engineering contracts at $6 billion, 10 percent lower than 1992. 
  But he said actual business turnover would hit $4 billion, 
up 
31 percent. 
  Chen attributed the slide in contract value partly to Sino- 
British disputes over Hong Kong.

  [Text] Jerusalem, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Israeli Minister of 
Industry and Trade Mikha Harish indicated today that Israel 
places great importance and high priority to developing 
relations with China. 
  Interviewed by XINHUA before his visit to China in his Tel 
Aviv office, the minister said the economic and trade relations 
between the two countries have developed significantly since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations in February 1992. 
  As a result of the trade agreement signed in October that 
year, he noted, the bilateral trade in 1992 totaled more than 54 
million U.S. dollars, representing a 137 percent increase 
compared with the previous year. 
  He revealed that "in the first nine months of 1993 China's 
exports to Israel grew more than 750 percent." 
  He said the aim of his forthcoming visit to China is to 
identify areas of cooperation" in the framework of the 1992 
trade agreement. 
  "We are doing two things now. One is at the official level 
and the other involves business people and companies," he said. 
  Since the visit of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to China in 
October, who was also accompanied by lots of business people, 
many Israeli companies have approached the Chinese side in 
various aspects of cooperation such as joint ventures and 
import-export projects. 
  He said Israel maintains three free trade agreements with 
the 
United States, the European Community (EC) and the EFTA 
countries (Sweden, Norway, Austria, Iceland, Finland, 
Liechtenstein and Switzerland). These free trade agreements 
give Israel a unique position in international trade, of which 
Chinese businessmen can take advantage. 
  He said Chinese manufacturers can export semi-processed 
goods 
to Israel, finalize their manufacturing process there according 
to established "rules of origin" and then export them to the 
U.S., EC and EFTA countries with no tariff at all. Thus, 
businesses in China can use Israel as a bridge to western 
markets. 
  He said his government is seeking a trade strategy of 
diversification and China, Japan and India will be its best 
partners in Asia and Pacific region.

  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- The three tiers of 
councils in the Hong Kong Government will be disbanded with the 
termination of British rule over Hong Kong and the abolition of 
relevant British laws supporting the councils on June 30, 1997, 
according to an on-going meeting here. 
  The meeting is that of the political affairs group of the 
preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which operates 
under the Standing Committee of China's National People's 
Congress. 
  According to the group, the People's Republic of China, in 
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, will resume 
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997; the British 
Government will also return Hong Kong to China on the same day. 
  This means that British rule over Hong Kong is based on two 
constitutional documents as legal grounds until June 30, 1997, 
when the rule of the British Government over Hong Kong will be 
ended. 
  That is to say, the British Government rules Hong Kong 
through a political structure composed of the Legislative 
Council, municipal councils and district boards, which embody 
British power. 
  However, with the termination of British rule over Hong Kong 
in 1997, the two constitutional documents will become null and 
void, marking the end of the British Hong Kong political 
structure. 
  British rule over Hong Kong can neither be extended beyond 
the date of June 30, 1997, nor can it be allowed to make any 
decisions to let the existing political structure do so. 
  Otherwise, it will be considered to have overstepped its 
power, and the principle of sovereignty stipulated in the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law will be 
meaningless. 
  As a result, the term of the last three-tier political 
structure of the British Hong Kong Government has to be 
terminated on June 30, 1997. 
  And the four-year term of the structure as set out in 
current 
British Government documents obviously contravenes the 
principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law. Therefore, it is invalid. 
  This is an inevitable outcome of the British handover of 
Hong 
Kong to China and of China's resumption of the sovereignty of 
Hong Kong. 
  The termination is also the duty of the British Government 
and the right of the Chinese Government as stipulated in the 
Joint Declaration. 
  The group explained that the first legislative body and 
districts organizations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, which will be established after July 1, 1997, will be 
different in nature from the political structure of the present 
Hong Kong Government. They will by no means be a "complete copy" 
of the old British Hong Kong political structure, but one that 
will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a regional 
administration under the Chinese Government. 
  They will be organized in accordance with the Basic Law and 
relevant decisions of the National People's Congress, and be run 
by local Hong Kong residents. 
  The Chinese Government had hoped to make an arrangement 
through Sino-British negotiations to extend the term of service 
of the British Hong Kong Legislative Council members, in a bid 
to achieve a smooth transition. 
  Unfortunately, no agreement was reached during the 
Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/1995 
elections in the territory, and the conditions for the council 
members to extend their service beyond June 30, 1997, no longer 
exist. 
  It should be pointed out that the two legislative 
institutions different in nature cannot be lumped together, even 
if there had been agreement reached between the two sides. 
  It is because of the different legal grounds that decide the 
different natures of the two legislative bodies. 
  As the component parts of the political structure, the 
district boards and two municipal councils are closely connected 
to administrative power of the British Hong Kong Government. 
  Therefore, they must also be abolished on June 30, 1997, 
just 
like the Legislative Council, the group concluded.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- The third meeting of the 
Government Affairs Subcommittee [GAS] of the Preliminary Working 
Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [SAR] was held in Beijing from 7 
to 8 January. 
  During the two-day meeting, members discussed the 
termination 
of the Hong Kong British authorities' last Legislative Council, 
two municipal councils, and district board. Members unanimously 
believed that the Hong Kong British authorities' administration 
over Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997, that the legal basis 
enabling them to maintain their power will also disappear, that 
the original political structures embodying their administration 
will as a matter of course terminate at the same time, and that 
neither can the Hong Kong British authorities' administration 
continue to exist after 30 June 1997 nor do the Hong Kong 
British authorities have the right to make any decision on the 
continued existence of these structures after 30 June 1997. In 
addition, the subcommittee meeting studied and discussed the 
election system for the first Legislative Council and district 
organizations of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  It has been learned that the fourth and fifth meetings of 
the 
PWC's GAS will be held in Beijing from 28 to 29 January and from 
24 to 26 February, respectively.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The society and 
security panel of the preliminary working committee for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress opened its second session in Beijing on January 9-10. 
  During the two-day meeting, the members of the panel 
discussed the legal condition for the question of "Taking Hong 
Kong as a Permanent Residential Place" and the question of Hong 
Kong residents' freedom in entering and leaving Hong Kong. 
  According to the stipulation of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, non-Chinese persons must 
meet the following three conditions for their becoming permanent 
residents in Hong Kong: that is, they must have valid travel 
visas upon entering Hong Kong, normally they should stay in Hong 
Kong for seven years or more and they should take Hong Kong as 
their permanent residence. 
  The members of the panel insisted that there should be 
objective and subjective requirements for non-Chinese people who 
will "take Hong Kong as their permanent residence" and the 
requirements should be clearly defined in some related laws. 
  They held that in principle, non-Chinese people should be 
permitted to adopt convenient and simple methods to recognize 
the requirement of "taking Hong Kong as permanent residence." 
  The members of the panel held that the stipulations of the 
Basic Law on Hong Kong residents' freedom in entering and 
leaving the region after 1997 are quite broad either in contents 
or in extent in comparison with the constitutions of some 
countries. These stipulations should be further publicized so 
that the Hong Kong residents really understand them, they said. 
  The panel decided to meet again in Beijing from February 28 
to March 1.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhang Junsheng, deputy 
director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, held that despite its 
repeated expressed hopes of resuming the negotiations, the 
British side has hitherto not shown sincerity. 
  When he arrived in Hong Kong on 7 January for a visit, 
Deputy 
British Foreign Secretary Goodlad indicated that the British 
side is ready to hold further talks with the Chinese side on the 
three-level framework and the "through train" issue. In 
answering a question on this issue asked by a Hong Kong media 
reporter, Zhang Junsheng said: 
  The Chinese side has always hoped that there will be 
"through 
trains." The Basic Law has also made arrangements concerning 
this matter. Even when Patten dished out his "three violations" 
political reform program in October 1992, which undermined the 
"through train" arrangement, the Chinese side was still willing 
to continue the negotiations. During the 17 rounds of 
Sino-British talks, it was the British side which closed the 
door to negotiations. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: If the British side sincerely hopes for 
a resumption of talks, it must withdraw completely Patten's 
[political reform] program which has been submitted to the 
Legislative Council and demonstrate its sincerity to the Chinese 
side through an official diplomatic channel. But up to now, the 
British side has not yet given any official, explicit reply.

<F P=106> [Interview with "relevant persons" by unidentified RENMIN </F>
RIBAO reporter; place and date not given: "Questions and 
Answers on Hong Kong's 1994-95 Electoral Arrangements"] 
  [Text] Recently, many readers have written or phoned this 
newspaper to raise various questions on the Sino-British talks 
on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements for Hong Kong. We have 
interviewed the relevant persons about those questions and have 
sorted out their answers in the following paragraphs for your 
reference. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What actually constitutes the 1994/95 
elections in Hong Kong? 
  [Relevant person] The 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong include 
the election of the District Boards in September 1994, the 
elections of the Urban Council and the Regional Council in March 
1995, and the election of the Legislative Council in September 
1995. Because these three tiers of elections are to be 
conducted in 1994 and 1995, they are generally called the 
1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What are these organs called the Legislative 
Council, Urban Council, Regional Council, and District Boards? 
  [Relevant person] The Legislative Council, Urban Council, 
Regional Council, and District Boards are the components of the 
political structure of the British Hong Kong authorities. They 
differ in nature, function, and organization. Let me explain 
the general situation as follows: 
  The Legislative Council in Hong Kong has been established 
according to the Letters Patent and is the highest among the 
three- tier structure created by the British Hong Kong 
authorities. In Hong Kong, the governor holds all the power; 
decisionmaking and legislative powers both belong to the 
governor. The Legislative Council does not have legislative 
power and is only there to assist the governor in legislation, 
to debate bills, and to examine and discuss affairs. The 
Legislative Council does not have the power to initiate a bill; 
this power rests with the Executive Council or the chief 
secretary, and the power to approve it rests with the governor. 
After a draft bill is adopted in the Legislative Council, it 
has to be approved by the governor in order to become law. In 
addition, Britain has the power to veto a law which has been 
passed by the Legislative Council and approved by the governor. 
Britain may also legislate on behalf of Hong Kong. The 
Legislative Council in Hong Kong is completely different from 
the representative congresses of sovereign states -- which are 
legislative organs possessing supreme power -- it is only a 
consultative body which advises the governor on legislative 
matters. The Legislative Council in Hong Kong has three main 
duties: First, to discuss and pass laws proposed by the 
Executive Council and to formulate regulations, including those 
determining the allocation of funds; second, to discuss, 
supervise, and control the government's financial expenditure; 
and, third, carry out inquiries and debates on government 
policies and matters which concern the people. Since its 
establishment in 1843, the Legislative Council in Hong Kong has 
undergone major changes in its organization. The current 
Legislative Council has 60 members, and among them 18 are 
directly elected from districts, 21 are appointed, and 21 are 
elected from functional constituencies. 
  The Urban Council and the Regional Council constitute the 
middle tier of the three-tier structure established by the 
British Hong Kong authorities. They are regional organizations 
that do not have political power. The two councils are on an 
equal footing and may also be called the two Municipal Councils. 
The former has jurisdiction over Hong Kong Island and the urban 
areas in Kowloon, while the latter has jurisdiction over the New 
Territories and the outlying islands. Their functions are to 
provide residents with cultural, recreational, and urban 
services, including environmental management, hygiene control, 
management of hawkers, and the construction and management of 
public recreational and sports facilities. The current Urban 
Council has 40 members, among whom 15 are elected by the people, 
15 are appointed, and 10 are members from various urban District 
Boards. The current Regional Council has 36 members, among whom 
12 are elected by the people, 12 are appointed, nine are members 
from the District Boards in the New Territories, and three are 
members who have reserved seats -- the chairman and the two vice 
chairmen of the Heung Yee Kuk [a body representing the 
indigenous population of the New Territories]. 
  The District Boards constitute the lowest tier of the 
three-tier structure established by the British Hong Kong 
authorities. Like the two Municipal Councils, the District 
Boards are regional organizations without political power. 
Their function is to provide consultation; in concrete terms, 
they primarily provide the government with ideas on matters 
which affect the welfare of the individuals who live or work in 
the districts and assist in supervising the work and policies of 
various government departments at the district level. In 
addition, the government often consults the District Boards on 
important issues which affect Hong Kong residents, such as the 
examination of regulations on urban planning, public housing 
policy, and health service reform at the grass-roots level. 
Hong Kong is currently divided into 19 districts, and District 
Boards differ in the number of members. The current round of 
District Boards has a total of 441 members, among whom 274 are 
elected by the people, 140 are appointed, and 27 are members who 
have reserved seats -- the chairmen of the rural committees of 
the New Territories. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Why must the Chinese and British Governments 
hold talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements for Hong Kong? 
  [Relevant person] According to the provisions of the Sino- 
British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Chinese 
Government will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 
1997; the British Government will return Hong Kong to the PRC on 
1 July 1997; and its administrative power over Hong Kong will 
end on 30 June 1997. Therefore, the political system and 
framework set up by the British Hong Kong authorities will also 
come to an end. Although the Letters Patent and the relevant 
stipulations stipulate that the members of the Legislative 
Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards -- 
bodies which have been set up by the British Hong Kong 
authorities -- should serve for four years, and, speaking in 
terms of time, their tenures will not expire on 30 June 1997, 
due to the fact that they are the components of the political 
structure established by the British Hong Kong authorities, this 
three-tier structure should be disbanded on 30 June 1997. By 
then, the new legislative assembly of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] and new regional organizations will 
be organized according to the decisions of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the 
provisions of the Basic Law. Therefore, in the first place, the 
British Hong Kong authorities have no right to bother about the 
political structure after 1997. Proceeding from the overall 
consideration of maintaining a stable transition for Hong Kong 
and the smooth transfer of political power, however, the Chinese 
Government hopes to be able to make the proper arrangements for 
the transition of the three-tier structure and its members 
through cooperation with the British Government on the basis of 
convergence with the Basic Law. 
  As early as the drafting of the Basic Law, the Chinese and 
British Governments held many rounds of discussions on the 
development of the political system in Hong Kong (including the 
exchange of letters between the two foreign ministers in early 
1990) and reached agreements, understandings, and a consensus. 
The British Government has promised time and again that the 
development of Hong Kong's political system during the 
transitional period will converge with the Basic Law. In order 
to enable the members of the final the Legislative Council in 
Hong Kong to become the members of the first legislative 
assembly of the Hong Kong SAR, on 4 April 1990, the NPC Standing 
Committee adopted the Decision on the Method for the Formation 
of the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the 
Hong Kong SAR, which specifically stipulated that "the first 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR shall be composed of 60 
members, with 20 members returned by geographical constituencies 
through direct elections, 10 members returned by an election 
committee, and 30 members returned by functional constituencies. 
If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council 
before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity 
with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law 
of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC and pledge allegiance to the 
Hong Kong SAR of the PRC and who meet the requirements set forth 
in the Basic Law of the Region may, upon confirmation by the 
Preparatory Committee, become members of the first Legislative 
Council of the Region." Because the two Municipal Councils and 
the District Boards were regional organizations without 
political power, the NPC did not formulate specific regulations 
on the transition of the members of these two tiers of 
organizations, leaving the issue to be decided through 
discussion between the Chinese and British Governments. 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration clearly stipulates that 
the Chinese and British Governments should strengthen 
cooperation on Hong Kong during the latter part of the 
transitional period and should examine together the measures 
which must be taken in order to ensure the smooth transfer of 
political power and a stable transition. Because the members of 
the Legislative Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the 
District Boards to be elected in 1994 and 1995 all face a 
problem of transition, the relevant 1994/95 electoral 
arrangements must be discussed by both the Chinese and British 
Governments so as to reach a consensus. The Chinese and British 
sides held talks this time with the precise purpose of 
discussing how the Legislative Council, the two Municipal 
Councils, and the District Boards that are to be elected in 1994 
and 1995 can converge with the Basic Law, so that their members 
can serve beyond 1 July 1997 and can become members of the first 
legislative assembly and regional organizations of the Hong Kong 
SAR, so as to realize a smooth transition for Hong Kong's 
political system. 
  The Chinese and British sides have yet to reach an agreement 
on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements. Under these 
circumstances, the British side has already submitted part of 
the relevant draft to the Legislative Council for discussion, 
and this has meant that the negotiations have stopped. Thus, 
the terms of office of the members of the last Legislative 
Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards to 
be formed by the British Hong Kong authorities in 1994 and 1995, 
will have to stop on 30 June 1997. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What was the background against which China 
and Britain started talks on the electoral arrangements for Hong 
Kong? 
  [Relevant person] As everyone knows, in October 1992, Hong 
Kong Governor Patten, who had been in office for less than three 
months, delivered his first policy address, in which he 
unilaterally proposed a "constitutional package" which sought to 
make important changes to Hong Kong's current political system. 
This proposal was made without prior discussion with the 
Chinese side, and such a thing should have been done according 
to the provisions of the Joint Declaration. The package 
included a concrete plan for the 1994/95 electoral arrangements 
for Hong Kong. This "package" violated the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration in terms of content and in terms of the way it was 
proposed; it violated the principle of convergence with the 
Basic Law; and it violated the relevant agreements and 
understandings already reached by the Chinese and British sides. 
It may be summarized as the "three violations" political reform 
package. 
  Patten's proposal of the package has placed an obstacle 
before cooperation between China and Britain on the Hong Kong 
question and has caused unrest and division in Hong Kong 
society. If Patten's plan is to be followed, it will make it 
impossible to have a smooth transfer of governing power over 
Hong Kong in 1997 or to have a smooth transition, and this will 
greatly affect Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Shortly 
after Patten proposed the "three violations" package, the 
Chinese Government expressed their strong objection to it. At 
that time, both the Foreign Ministry spokesman and the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office spokesman solemnly pointed out that, 
during Hong Kong's transitional period, if the development of 
the political system is unable to converge with the Basic Law, 
the responsibility will not rest on the Chinese side. When the 
leaders of the Chinese Government met the leaders of the British 
Government, they repeatedly made it clear that they hoped the 
British Government, keeping in mind the overall consideration of 
maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and the common 
interests of China and Britain, will return to the track of 
discussion and cooperation as stipulated by the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration. At the same time, Patten's package naturally 
met with strong objection and criticism from the people of 
various levels in Hong Kong, as well as from knowledgeable 
persons in Britain, both within the government and without. It 
was precisely under these circumstances that the British 
Government had no choice but to request diplomatic negotiations 
with the Chinese Government on the issue of Hong Kong's 1994/95 
electoral arrangements. Proceeding from the overall 
consideration of realizing Hong Kong's smooth transition and 
maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the Chinese 
Government accepted the proposal on conducting diplomatic 
negotiations put forward by the British Government. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] On the issue of the 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong, what elements of Chris Patten's 
proposal gave concrete expression to the "three violations?" 
  [Relevant person] On the issue of the 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's 
"three violations" found expression in the following points: 
  1. He changed the character of the indirect elections 
through the functional constituencies and transformed the 
elections by functional constituencies into direct elections in 
a disguised form. The system of functional constituency 
elections was designed by the British Hong Kong Government 
according to Hong Kong's history and the condition of social 
development and was first put into practice in 1985. It served 
the purpose of guaranteeing that people in the business and 
professional circles who play an important role in Hong Kong's 
economic prosperity and social stability would have 
representatives in the Legislative Council. When drafting the 
Basic Law, the Chinese Government affirmed such election form in 
consideration of the current condition of the development of 
Hong Kong's political structure, and the Basic Law specifies 
that, for the first three terms of the Legislative Council after 
the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, seats would still be 
preserved for members elected by functional constituencies. 
Because these Legislative Councillors are to be elected by 
various functional constituencies determined in legal terms, 
this is a form of indirect election. The British Hong Kong 
Government also acknowledged in its legal documents that the 
functional constituency elections are indirect elections. In 
his "constitutional reform package," however, Patten replaced 
all forms of corporate voting with individual voters; at the 
same time, he extended the franchise in the functional 
constituencies to all eligible voters in the local working 
population so that "every single worker" in Hong Kong will have 
the second opportunity to vote in addition to the direct 
election. Patten's arrangement not only changed the original 
purpose of arranging functional constituency elections but also 
transformed the indirect elections through functional 
constituencies into direct elections in various trades. 
  2. With regard to the composition of the Election Committee, 
Patten's proposal violated the Sino-British agreements and 
understandings on this issue. In early 1990, the Chinese 
Government and the British Government repeatedly held 
consultations on the composition of the Election Committee. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and then British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd exchanged letters several times (these 
diplomatic documents were made public on 28 October 1992). 
Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on the composition 
of the 1995 Election Committee. The British side agreed in 
principle with the composition form and proportion specified by 
the second point of Annex I of the Basic Law for the Election 
Committee, which stipulated that the committee will be composed 
of four sectors, specifically, the industrial, commercial, and 
financial sector; the professional sector; the labor, social 
services, religious, and other sector; and members of the 
Legislative Council, representatives of district-based 
organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's 
Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference. Each sector was to hold 25 percent of 
the seats in the Election Committee. Patten, however, 
disregarded the agreement reached by the Chinese side and the 
British side a long time ago and put forth a different method 
for forming the Election Committee in his "constitutional reform 
package." According to Patten, the committee will be wholly or 
mostly composed of directly elected District Board members. The 
Basic Law's specification that the Election Committee be 
included in the election of the first SAR Legislative council 
was aimed at increasing the representativeness of the 
Legislative Council and ensuring the balanced participation of 
people in all social strata and in all walks of life. Patten's 
proposal, however, not only directly violated the agreement that 
had been reached by China and Britain, but also went against the 
original reason for setting up the Election Committee. 
  3. On the issue of the elections of the District Boards and 
the two municipal councils, Patten proposed in his package that 
all appointed membership to these organizations be discontinued. 
This violated the principle of the gradual development of Hong 
Kong's political structure specified by the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law. In addition, this was not suited 
to the actual operational needs of the District Boards and the 
two municipal councils. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the crux of the Sino-British dispute 
over the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong? 
  [Relevant person] Chris Patten introduced his 
"constitutional reform package" in the name of "expanding 
democracy in Hong Kong." This gave the public the false 
impression that Patten is trying to expand democracy in Hong 
Kong, while the Chinese side does not agree with the development 
of democracy in Hong Kong. This is absolutely not the case. 
  For more than 150 years of British rule in Hong Kong, the 
governors have consistently arrogated all power to themselves, 
and there has never been democracy whatsoever in Hong Kong. The 
Hong Kong Legislative Council was established in 1843, and all 
of its members were appointed by the governors in over 140 years 
after that. Not until 1985 -- after the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration on the Hong Kong issue was signed -- did a few 
indirectly elected legislative members sit on the council. 
Therefore, the development of Hong Kong's political structure 
must proceed from this historical and social reality and must 
proceed in an orderly way step by step so that it will be 
favorable to the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability. In the remaining years of the transitional period, 
Patten rashly decided to "expand democracy in Hong Kong" and 
make a great change to the existing constitutional system 
without regard to the agreements, understandings, and consensus 
that the Chinese side and the British side had reached. He did 
this in an attempt to impose the British-style parliamentary 
democracy upon Hong Kong and to compel Hong Kong to cover the 
road to a perfect parliamentary democracy in a few years which 
the Western capitalist countries took several hundred years to 
cover. This can only serve to create obstacles to a smooth 
transfer of power and endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability. 
  The Chinese Government has consistently favored promoting 
democracy in Hong Kong. It was the Chinese Government, when 
beginning the talks on the Hong Kong issue with the British side 
in 1982, that clearly announced the adoption of such principles 
and policies as "one country, two systems," "allowing Hong Kong 
people to administer Hong Kong," and "allowing Hong Kong to 
exercise a high degree of autonomy" after China recovers 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. The Basic Law, in particular, 
provides specific and adequate guarantees for the Hong Kong 
people's democratic rights. According to the Basic Law, the 
chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR will be selected by 
election or through consultations and ultimately will be 
selected by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly 
representative nominating committee in accordance with 
democratic procedures. The SAR Legislative Council will have 
full legislative power and administrative supervisory power. It 
will have the right to impeach the chief executive. The number 
of seats returned by direct elections will increase from 20 to 
30 in a short period of six years from 1997 to 2003. The method 
of forming the SAR Legislative Council will be specified in 
light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in 
accordance with the principle of orderly and gradual progress, 
and all members of the Legislative Council will eventually be 
elected by universal suffrage. Facts show that the democracy to 
be introduced in Hong Kong after 1997 as stipulated by the Basic 
Law will be much greater than that which has been given to the 
Hong Kong people by the British rulers over the last 150 years. 
This was precisely the reason why the Basic Law was extensively 
supported by the masses from all social strata in Hong Kong. 
When the Basic Law was officially promulgated in April 1990, 
the spokesman for the British Foreign Office also explicitly 
indicated that the Basic Law "lays the foundation for Hong 
Kong's future status" and "is the acceptable reflection of the 
Joint Declaration." In the course of drafting the Basic Law, 
the British side repeatedly stressed the need for the 
convergence of the pre- 1997 developments of Hong Kong's 
political structure with the Basic Law, and the Chinese side and 
the British side reached a consensus on this matter. Obviously, 
the British side should make arrangements for Hong Kong's 
1994-95 elections in accordance with the principle of 
convergence with the Basic Law and with the agreements and 
understandings reached by the two sides in order to make things 
favorable to the changeover of government and smooth transition 
in 1997. However, the British side has openly broken faith with 
the Chinese side and has gone its own way. 
  All this shows that the crux of the Sino-British dispute 
over 
Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements is in no way 
concerned with a number of specific issues related, for example, 
to the arrangements of the functional constituency elections or 
the election committee election, nor does it concern the issue 
of whether it is necessary to promote democracy in Hong Kong or 
the speed at which democracy should be promoted; rather, this is 
a matter of whether the British side is willing to act in good 
faith and a matter of political principle concerning whether it 
is still willing to honor the Joint Declaration, to make the 
development of Hong Kong's political structure converge with the 
Basic Law, and to observe and implement the agreements and 
understandings that the two sides have reached. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the basic position and attitude that 
the Chinese have held in the talks? 
  [Relevant person] When the two sides were still making 
preparations before the beginning of the talks, the Chinese side 
announced its position, that the Sino-British talks on the 
1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong must be based on the 
Sino- British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence 
with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and 
understandings already reached between the two sides. 
  The Chinese Government maintained that, if the two sides 
could reach an agreement on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements through the talks, this would be conducive to the 
smooth transfer of government and a smooth transition in 1997, 
would be favorable to both sides, and would be in keeping with 
the fundamental and long- term interests of the Hong Kong 
residents. In order to enable the talks to proceed smoothly and 
to reach an agreement at an earlier date, the Chinese side 
consistently held a sincere and positive attitude toward the 
talks and made great efforts to promote the talks inside and 
outside the meeting place and to quicken the process of the 
talks. The Chinese side agreed to restore the meeting of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the meeting of the Airport 
Committee; solved the issues concerning the cable television 
franchise contract, the renewal of Hong Kong Electric's 
agreement, and the garbage landfill zone in the western New 
Territories; made the Sino-British Land Commission solve the 
1993-94 land allocation issue; endorsed starting the western 
tunnel project and the Central and Wanchai reclamation project 
before a comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial 
arrangements was reached; and proposed that two meetings of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group be held separately in Beijing 
and London within 1993 to quicken its work. All this showed the 
Chinese side's sincerity for restoring Sino-British cooperation 
on the Hong Kong issue. In the course of the talks, the Chinese 
side not only adhered to its principles, it also showed 
flexibility. For issues on which agreements and understandings 
had been reached by the two sides in the past, the Chinese side 
insisted on following the existing agreements and 
understandings; on issues which were not explicitly mentioned by 
the existing agreements and understandings or had not been 
discussed by the two sides, the Chinese side adopted a flexible 
approach and showed its willingness to hold discussions with the 
British side in order to seek solutions acceptable to both sides. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Why did the talks make progress so slowly 
and fail to reach any agreement over such a long time? 
  [Relevant person] Before the beginning of the talks, the 
British side agreed with the principle of converging with the 
Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and agreed to 
take the agreements and understandings that the two side had 
reached in the past as the foundation for the talks as the 
Chinese side required. If the British side could actually act 
according to these "three principles" in the talks, then it 
would not be difficult for the two sides to reach an agreement. 
However, things did not go according to our wishes. The 
British side repeatedly went back on its words during the talks. 
It not only refused to put forth its own plan according to the 
relevant provisions of the Basic Law, but also refused to 
acknowledge the agreements and understandings previously reached 
between the two countries. In the talks, although the British 
side showed some flexibility on certain concrete issues, it 
continued to insist on the position of Patten's "three 
violations" package and made no substantial changes. For the 
issues which are not clearly specified in the Basic Law or on 
which the two sides did not reach agreements or understandings 
in the past, the British side stubbornly required the Chinese 
side to totally accept its ideas. Moreover, during the talks, 
the British side even mentioned some affairs within the scope of 
China's sovereignty and some issues that were not related to the 
talks and required the Chinese side to make a promise, thus 
creating obstacles to the talks. 
  At the beginning of the talks, the British side said that 
they had always maintained a positive and constructive attitude 
toward the talks, but actual practice in the talks only showed 
the opposite. During the course of the talks, the British side 
continued to play "little tricks" to undermine and disrupt the 
smooth process of the talks. For example, before the two sides 
reached any agreement, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council 
hastily adopted the "draft bill on the Boundary and Election 
Commission" and substantially increased the number of elected 
District Board members, and the British Hong Kong authorities 
gazetted the "Ordinance on the Proposed Number and Names of 
Districts" and decided to decrease the number of District Boards 
from 19 to 18. The British Hong Kong authorities also connived 
at and supported the decision of the Constitutional Development 
Panel of the Legislative Council to discuss Governor Patten's 
"constitutional package" in an attempt to advance the 
legislative process while the talks were going on. A senior 
official from the British Foreign Ministry even openly alleged 
that the future Sino- British agreement would be submitted to 
the Legislative Council for discussion and revision, thus 
placing the decision of the Hong Kong Legislative Council above 
the agreement reached by the Chinese and British Governments. 
Throughout the process of the talks, the British side also 
continued to exert pressure on the Chinese side by setting a 
deadline for the talks and warned that "the Hong Kong governor 
would make a decision if there was no obvious progress in the 
talks." 
  Because the British side stubbornly stuck to Patten's "three 
violations" package and created obstacles to the talks on every 
issue, the talks made progress very slowly and failed to reach 
any agreement over a long period of time. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Why did the Chinese side propose that the 
issue concerning the arrangements for the Legislative Council 
elections and the District Board and Municipal Council elections 
be separately discussed and solved? What was the British side's 
attitude toward this? 
  [Relevant person] In order to advance the talks and also in 
consideration of the fact that the elections to the District 
Boards and the two Municipal Councils will be held earlier and 
that the issue related to this part of elections is simpler, in 
the fourth round of the talks the Chinese side proposed that the 
issue concerning the arrangements for the elections to the 
District Boards and Municipal Councils be first discussed and 
solved before the issues concerning the Legislative Council 
elections are discussed. However, this proposal was rejected by 
the British side, which argued that the 1994-95 elections should 
be handled as a "package." As the talks had been held for more 
than five months and little progress had been made, on 1 October 
when meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in New 
York, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen once 
again proposed that the 1994-95 electoral arrangements be 
discussed and solved in two separate parts. Qian pointed out 
that, as 1994 was drawing near, time was pressing, and the 1994 
elections were comparatively simpler, so the two sides might 
first discuss the issue of the 1994 elections and reach an 
agreement. The more complicated 1995 election issue can wait, 
as there is still time for the two sides to continue the 
discussion. This was the principle of "dealing with easier 
things first and dealing with more difficult things later" and 
the reason behind the Chinese side's proposal for "separately" 
dealing with the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. 
At that time, the British side once again turned down the 
Chinese side's proposal. In his second policy address in 
October 1993, Patten also made it clear that "this was 
impracticable." Because the Chinese side's proposal was 
reasonable, however, it was endorsed and supported widely by 
many Hong Kong people. Afterward, the British side had no 
choice but to agree with the Chinese side's proposal on 
discussing the electoral arrangements for the District Boards 
and Municipal Councils first, but it set forth three 
preconditions: requiring the Chinese side to agree to lower the 
voting age from 21 to 18, to accept the British side's proposal 
on the voting method, and to discontinue all appointed 
membership in these organizations. The British side's 
intentions were obvious. On one hand, it tried to meet the Hong 
Kong people's wishes by agreeing to "separately" handle the 
1994-95 electoral arrangements in order to free itself from the 
predicament; on the other hand, it tried to use the three 
preconditions to set an obstacle to the actual "separate" 
handling, because, if the Chinese side did not accept the three 
requirements, "separate" handling would become impossible. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Why is it said that it is entirely possible 
for China and Britain to reach an accord on the electoral 
arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal 
bodies? 
  [Relevant person] The Chinese side has criticized the 
British side's consent for "separating" the 1994 and 1995 
electoral arrangements and its practice of setting out three 
preconditions, while indicating that that was not a constructive 
attitude in seeking a solution. Proceeding from the overall 
situation, however, the Chinese side agreed to the British 
side's requirement on lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 
years, while raising no objection to the British side's proposal 
of adopting the "one-seat, one-vote system" (a district ballot 
method, namely, the number of districts coincides with the 
number of seats, with only one seat to every district. Each 
voter can cast only one vote in the election.) On the issue of 
abolishing appointed seats, the Chinese side set forth a 
different opinion. That was the focus of the argument between 
the Chinese and British sides over the electoral arrangements 
for district boards and the two municipal bodies. 
  Chris Patten's suggestion on abolishing the appointed seats 
in the district boards and the two municipal bodies in his 
"constitutional reform package" immediately met strong 
opposition from the presidents of the district boards and the 
two municipal bodies and the majority of their members. Neither 
did the majority of Hong Kong residents approve of abolishing 
all appointed seats. Taking into consideration this wish of Hong 
Kong residents as well as the actual operation of the district 
boards and the two municipal bodies, the Chinese side believed 
that maintaining some appointed seats would be conducive to 
those bodies better exercising their functions, and fall in line 
with Hong Kong's actual conditions; on such grounds, the Chinese 
side was for maintaining the existing number of appointed seats 
in the district boards and the two municipal bodies. 
Nevertheless, on the grounds that the Legislative Council would 
abolish the system of appointed seats in the 1995 election, the 
British side insisted on the abolition of appointed seats in the 
district boards and the two municipal bodies. The British 
side's grounds did not hold water. Whether or not the appointed 
seats exist in the district boards and the two municipal bodies 
has nothing to do with the election of the Legislative Council, 
because their nature and functions are different. The two sides 
conducted repeated discussions on this issue; despite the fact 
that the Chinese side compromised and stated that the number of 
appointed seats should be axed to one-fourth of all seats from 
the original one-third based on the principle of proceeding in 
an orderly way and step by step, the British side was bent on 
abolishing all appointed seats, and was unwilling to yield an 
inch. 
  In order to reach an accord with the British side on the 
electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two 
municipal bodies as quickly as possible, the Chinese side 
exerted efforts again during the 15th round of talks, and set 
out a compromise way of taking into consideration both sides' 
positions, bypassing disputes, namely, an explanation would be 
added to the understanding reached between the two sides: The 
British side was for abolishing the appointed seats in the 
district boards and the two municipal bodies; the Chinese side 
was for maintaining an appropriate proportion of appointed 
seats. After 30 June 1997, the Hong Kong SAR Government would 
decide on the number of district boards and appointed seats on 
its own based on the stipulation of Basic Law Article 98. This 
plan of the Chinese side actually allowed the British side to 
abolish appointed seats before 30 June 1997, but after that date 
an appropriate proportion of appointed seats would be 
established according to the relevant stipulation in the Basic 
Law by the Hong Kong SAR Government. The British side agreed to 
the Chinese side's opinion on the issue of appointed seats 
mentioned above. 
  By then, the Chinese side had already adopted the British 
side's opinions on the issues of the voting age, voting method, 
and appointed seats involved in the elections of the district 
boards and the municipal councils, and had met the British 
side's demands. 
  In addition to the aforesaid issues, there were two other 
issues involving the election of the district boards and the 
municipal councils. One of the issues was that the 
nongovernment nature and functions of the Hong Kong district 
boards and the two municipal bodies would remain unchanged in 
the last four years of the transition period because of 
convergence with the relevant stipulation in the Basic Law. On 
this issue, there was no major difference between the Chinese 
and British sides. Another issue was that for convergence with 
the Basic Law, the Chinese side required the British side to 
promise to lift restrictions on delegates to the people's 
congresses at various levels from the Hong Kong area 
participating in elections. On this issue, the British side 
eventually expressed their agreement after some procrastination. 
  The aforesaid conditions showed that on all issues involved 
in the elections of the district boards and the two municipal 
bodies, the Chinese side and its British counterpart tended to 
become unanimous in their positions. In fact, it was entirely 
possible for the two sides to reach an accord on the electoral 
arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal 
bodies in the wake of the 15th round. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Why was it that the two sides failed to reach 
an accord when the Chinese side and its British counterpart had 
tended to become unanimous in their positions on all issues 
involved in the elections of the district boards and the two 
municipal bodies? 
  [Relevant person] The cause of the failure of the two 
sides to reach an accord on the electoral arrangements for the 
district boards and the two municipal bodies lies precisely in 
the fact that the British side raised new issues and set out new 
demands. 
  Before the 16th round of talks began, the British side put 
to 
its Chinese counterpart the proposal that the voting method 
characterized by "one seat, one vote" for the election of the 
district boards and the two municipal bodies must also be 
applicable to the 1995 district elections of the Legislative 
Council. This demand of the British side was groundless, 
because neither regulations nor precedent exist that the same 
voting method must be adopted in the elections of district 
boards, the two municipal bodies, and the Legislative Council. 
Matters regarding the election of the Legislative Council, 
including the voting method to be adopted, could be resolved 
later in discussions on those elections. Otherwise, matters 
could be made complicated, and it would not be conducive to the 
talks' progress. However, the British side insisted on 
including the application of the "one seat, one vote" voting 
method to the election of the Legislative Council in the 
memorandum of understanding on the electoral arrangements for 
the district boards and the two municipal bodies. The British 
side stated that its demand was based on the need for a 
"balanced" accord, for "practical and political reasons." 
  The so-called "balance" the British side referred to was its 
agreement to lift the restrictions on delegates to the people's 
congresses at various levels participating in the election of 
the three-tier assemblies, with the change in the voting age 
being applicable to the three-tier elections. Under such 
circumstances, if the Chinese side disagreed with adopting the 
same voting method for the election of the three-tier 
assemblies, that would spell imbalance. Directed at the British 
way of putting it, the Chinese side specially submitted a draft 
understanding to the British side in the 17th round of talks, 
with the suggestion that the three points, namely, the voting 
age, the voting method, and lifting restrictions on delegates to 
the people's congresses be confined to the elections to the 
district boards and the two municipal bodies, and that all 
issues involving the elections to the Legislative Council be 
resolved later. However, the suggestion of the Chinese side 
aimed at seeking a solution to the problems was immediately 
rejected by the British side. 
  As to the so-called "practical and political reasons," the 
British side chiefly referred to the two following points: 
First, the legislation on the voting method for the Legislative 
Council needs be adopted as quickly as possible; if the voting 
method should pass through legislation on two occasions, that 
would be a waste of time. In actual fact, the voting method for 
the district boards and the two municipal bodies and that for 
the Legislative Council have no necessary connection; their 
legislation has always been separate in the past. Furthermore, 
the election of the Legislative Council is to take place in 
September 1995, it was not so pressing in terms of time, and 
could be resolved later on. That being the case, this reason of 
the British side's did not hold water. Second, the British side 
said that back in 1992 the Legislative Council had adopted a 
motion on its adoption of the "one seat, one vote system" for 
its 1995 election; that being the case, it was imperative to fix 
such a voting method at present. The British side actually 
wanted the Chinese side to accept the opinion of the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council, and place its opinion above the talks 
between the Chinese and British Governments. The Chinese side 
would never accept that point. 
  Under the circumstance that the British side had failed to 
achieve its aim of killing two birds with one stone, namely 
simultaneously resolving the voting method for the Legislative 
Council and that for the district boards and the two municipal 
bodies, the British issued a "statement" shortly before the 
conclusion of the 17th round, saying that the British side could 
no longer continue the understanding reached with the Chinese 
side in the first phase of the talks, and unilaterally announced 
the interruption [zhong duan 0022 2451] of the talks on the 
electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two 
municipal bodies. Facts have proved that precisely because of 
the jeopardy deliberately introduced by the British side, no 
accord was reached in the Sino-British talks on the electoral 
arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal 
bodies. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Why do we say that the British side should 
be held responsible for the termination of the Sino-British 
talks over Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements? 
  [Relevant person] Before the talks started, when both sides 
sides were discussing through diplomatic channels the issue of 
holding talks, the Chinese side already had pointed clearly that 
if the British side submitted the relevant bills to the 
Legislative Council [Legco] before an agreement was reached 
between China and Britain through the talks, it would indicate 
that the British side had no sincerity whatsoever in the talks 
and would mean the termination of talks; the responsibility 
would not rest on the Chinese side. Through diplomatic channels 
the Chinese side once again expressed this solemn and just stand 
following the end of the 17th round of talks, but the British 
side turned a deaf ear to the repeated warnings and dissuasion 
of the Chinese Government. On 2 December 1993, Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten issued a statement on Hong Kong's 
1994/1995 electoral arrangements, declaring that on 10 December 
1993, he would gazette part of his bill on Hong Kong's elections 
and on 15 December, would submit the bill for discussion by 
Legco. 
  In response to this British move, spokesmen from the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry, the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch in Hong Kong 
issued separate statements reiterating that if the British Hong 
Kong authorities went ahead with the legislative process on the 
1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong, this would mean that the 
British side had terminated the talks unilaterally. The British 
side went ahead, however, regardless of warnings, gazetting the 
relevant bill as scheduled, and tabling it before Legco for its 
first and second readings. 
  The facts demonstrate that the Chinese side has shown the 
utmost sincerity and patience toward the talks, and that the 
British side should be held fully responsible for their 
termination. Although the British side has continued to say 
that they wish to have an 18th round of talks with the Chinese 
side on the remaining issues related to the 1994/1995 elections 
-- which are more complicated -- and that they "will never leave 
the negotiating table," this is but a trick to deceive the 
public and to shift responsibility for terminating the talks 
onto the other side. If the British side is truly sincere about 
resuming the talks, reopening of talks will be possible only 
after it has withdrawn the partial bill that has been tabled 
before Legco. The door to negotiations remains open; the key 
lies in the attitude of the British side. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] As the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's 
electoral arrangements have terminated, what does the Chinese 
side plan to do? 
  [Relevant person] It is very clear that because China and 
Britain are unable to reach an agreement on Hong Kong's 
1994/1995 electoral arrangements, the transition issue does not 
exist for the members of the last Legco, the two municipal 
councils, and the district boards of the British Hong Kong 
administration. Their term of office will last only until 30 
June 1997. By that time, the Chinese side will have "set up 
another kitchen" in accordance with the decisions of the NPC and 
the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, and will have 
reconstituted Legco and the district organizations of the Hong 
Kong SAR. 
  Recently, the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong 
SAR Preparatory Committee held its second plenary meeting. The 
participants discussed Hong Kong's current situation and 
expressed their strong resent against the serious measures taken 
by the British side, which submitted part of the bill concerning 
Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements to the Legco under 
conditions of no agreement having been reached between the 
Chinese and British Governments. The meeting held that this was 
a deliberate sabotage of the talks by the British side and that 
the British Government should be held responsible for all 
consequences. It decided to accelerate the pace of various 
preparatory work for resuming the exercise of sovereignty over 
Hong Kong.

"Only the `Basic Law' Can Guarantee That the Hong Kong People 
Will Enjoy the Essence of Democracy -- Comments on and Analysis 
of Chris Patten's `Constitutional Reform Package'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan (XINHUA) -- In approximately three 
months after Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten had been in office, 
he hastily dished out his "constitutional reform package," 
saying again and again that he wanted to assume "a moral 
responsibility" for Hong Kong and to promote its 
"democratization" as quickly as possible. Clinging obstinately 
to his course, he promoted the sale of his "constitutional 
reform package" in the past year or so regardless of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements and 
understanding reached between China and Britain, as if whoever 
opposes his "constitutional reform package" opposes democracy. 
Thus, Chris Patten suddenly transformed himself from a colonial 
dictator into a fighter for "democracy." 
  Such a practice on the part of Chris Patten is 
incomprehensible to many people: There has never been a tiny 
bit of democracy in Hong Kong, which has been under British rule 
for over 150 years; "royal instructions" are followed in all 
[government] affairs there; and the Hong Kong governor alone is 
in control of all the powers. What makes him think of giving 
democracy to the Hong Kong people just before British colonial 
rule is about to end? Even Mr. Sharp [name as received], former 
chairman of the Britain-China Trade Association, also said that 
he could not understand why Chris Patten was in such a hurry to 
promote democratization in Hong Kong. 
  China has repeatedly declared that the focal point of our 
differences with Britain is not a question of whether democracy 
should be implemented but rather a question of whether one's 
promise should be kept. Democracy is an important mark of 
social progress. The Chinese Government has all along been for 
the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong, and it was 
China that was the first of the two countries to propose the 
implementation of democracy in Hong Kong and the democratic 
rights of a "high degree of autonomy" for the Hong Kong people 
under "one country, two systems" during the Sino-British talks 
back in 1982. Then, China spent as long as four years and eight 
months formulating the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the PRC" and putting forward the 
principle of proceeding in an orderly way and step by step for 
the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong. 
  The "democracy" hastily bestowed by Chris Patten as a favor 
obviously violates the law of development. All matters in the 
world have their own law of development. Like many matters, the 
democratic system has a process of coming into being, 
development, and taking shape. It is not accomplished in one 
step. The process of the development of the modern democratic 
system explains this point. The transition from feudal 
dictatorship to the capitalist democratic system of our time 
took several hundred years. For example, passing from the 
bourgeois democratic revolution in 1688 to the establishment of 
the one-person, one-vote election system in 1948 took Britain 
nearly 300 years; and the United States took 200 years to go 
from the formulation of its Constitution and the beginning of 
the implementation of democratic reforms in 1787 to the exercise 
of one-person, one-vote rights in general elections by 18- 
year-old citizens in the 1980's. 
  Very obviously, Hong Kong's democracy cannot be accomplished 
overnight. Accelerating the democratization process by force in 
violation of the law of development will inevitably result in 
drastic social turmoil and chaos, affect social stability, and, 
furthermore, have an impact on Hong Kong's investment 
environment. The broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots do not 
want to see such things happen. 
  On account of the aforementioned consideration, the "Basic 
Law" states that Hong Kong will have both direct elections and 
indirect elections in the first 10 years after 1997 and that the 
transition to general elections will be achieved according to 
the procedures prescribed by law by the year 2007. The 10-year 
transitional period, compared with 200 to 300 years in Britain 
and the United States, is actually very, very short. Therefore, 
it should be said that the process of democratic reform 
stipulated by the "Basic Law" not only takes into consideration 
the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong but also conforms to 
the law governing the development of democracy itself. 
  In the process of drafting the "Basic Law," China has 
extensively solicited the opinions of the people of all walks of 
life and social strata in Hong Kong and has taken into full 
account their 40 to 50 proposals concerning Hong Kong's 
political system. When it was promulgated, the "Basic Law" was 
well received by the Chinese people, including the compatriots 
in Hong Kong, and by the people of the world. They universally 
held that the "Basic Law" not only embodies the Hong Kong 
people's aspirations but also conforms to the interests of 
economic development in Hong Kong and to the requirements for 
its stability. Even the British Government has spoken highly of 
the "Basic Law." In Britain, both the prime minister(s) and 
ministers have expressed their satisfaction with the "Basic Law" 
on many occasions, and the British side has repeatedly promised 
to converge with it. 
  However, at a time when the "Basic Law" needs to be further 
publicized, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten dished out his 
"political reform program" in an attempt to "expand democracy" 
in Hong Kong. This is an openly perfidious act. 
  People cannot but ask: Why does Patten want to go against 
the objective law and ignore Hong Kong's safety? People who 
know the history of colonial rule can see the real purpose of 
the Hong Kong Government: It is vainly attempting to help, 
through so-called democratic elections, a group of pro-British 
persons gain power, especially those who dare to challenge the 
central government, so as to make the government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] powerless after 1997. 
In doing so, Britain can attain its goal of ruling Hong Kong 
without Britons -- continuing its colonial rule over Hong Kong 
in another form. 
  When he met with Geoffrey Howe on 31 July 1984, Deng 
Xiaoping 
said: "I hope that the Hong Kong Government will not form a 
leading body of its own during the transitional period and then 
impose it on the government of the Hong Kong SAR." Today, his 
prediction with profound insight has been proved accurate. 
  History has shown that before withdrawing from its colonies, 
Britain would invariably pursue a policy of division and create 
contradictions and confrontations to facilitate its manipulation 
and control in an attempt to maintain its political and economic 
interests in its former colonies. The same shameful tricks of 
this old-brand imperialist have been employed in many of its 
colonies in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not only were they not 
successful, but they were condemned as shameful tricks by the 
people of the world. Therefore, what Britain is doing with 
regard to the Hong Kong issue is obviously a replaying of the 
same old tricks. The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are 
able to see through these tricks. 
  What the Hong Kong Government did more than 20 years ago 
can help us see through its shameful tricks. In the 1970's, 
Britain applied two international human rights conventions to 
Hong Kong, but it omitted the portions on democratic elections 
so that those would not be practiced in Hong Kong. In 
displaying the big banner of "democracy" at a time just before 
its withdrawal, is it not clear now as to what its ulterior 
motives are? In sharp contrast to this situation, the Chinese 
side included democracy in the "Basic Law" when there was not an 
iota of democracy in Hong Kong. 
  Faced with iron-clad facts, a slight change seems to have 
taken place in the tune of "democracy" sung by Chris Patten. He 
claimed in a high-sounding manner that his arrangements on 
direct elections are "open, just, and accepted by the Hong Kong 
people." This new argument seems beautiful, but is actually 
pale and weak. 
  It is known to all that during the five years of drafting 
the 
"Basic Law," China had carried out a very open and democratic 
way of discussions on all issues, both primary and secondary 
ones, especially on the method of selecting the chief executive 
of the government of the Hong Kong SAR and the forming of the 
Legislative Council. Members of the drafting committee could 
say what they wanted to say and could express their views 
freely. Every article and every annex of the "Basic Law" was 
passed with a two-thirds majority by all members of the drafting 
committee in a secret ballot. Members of the drafting committee 
visited Hong Kong many times to solicit the opinions of the 
people from all walks of life regarding the method of selecting 
the chief executive and the method of forming legislative 
organs. Many revisions were made regarding this question. The 
processing of drafting the "Basic Law" was highly transparent: 
A news communique was published after each meeting. In four 
years, nearly 100 news conferences were held by the Political 
Group. Therefore, only the method of selecting the chief 
executive of the Hong Kong SAR and the method of forming the 
Legislative Council prescribed by the "Basic Law" are open and 
just. Moreover, the masses of people in Hong Kong are satisfied 
with them. In contrast, Chris Patten's "political reform 
program" is not open and democratic. He arrived in Hong Kong in 
June 1992, and in September he dished out his "political reform 
program." Except for his premeditations with the British 
Government in concocting this program, he had no prior 
consultations with anyone, nor did he solicit the opinions of 
the people of Hong Kong. It can be said that Chris Patten 
dished out his "political reform program" without an iota of 
democracy at all. 
  The essence of democracy is that the people enjoy the rights 
to their own interests and happiness. The biggest interest of 
the Hong Kong people is the maintenance of Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability. Only the "Basic Law" can satisfy the 
wishes and demands of the masses of compatriots in Hong Kong; 
only the "Basic Law" can bring about true and real democracy in 
Hong Kong; and only the "Basic Law" can guarantee the most 
important interest of the Hong Kong people. This has become the 
consensus of many people. 
  "Democracy" under Chris Patten's signboard is not only very 
deceptive but also extremely dangerous. Just imagine -- what 
good does it do the economy of Hong Kong if Chris Patten leaves 
behind a legislature that divides the Hong Kong people and 
challenges the future SAR government? What consequences will 
such a situation bring to investors in Hong Kong? 
  The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are very patriotic. 
We are convinced that in the transitional period before 1997, 
more and more Hong Kong people will see through the real purpose 
of the British authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with 
the people from the motherland to maintain Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability. Hong Kong -- the brilliant pearl of 
the East -- will certainly be able to return smoothly to the 
embrace of the motherland!

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Li Haitang: "`Basic Law' </F>
Essentially Ensures Democracy for Hong Kong People] 
  [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- The "Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" (SAR) will guarantee 
Hong Kong essential democracy in the interest of the Hong Kong 
people. 
  The essence of democracy is to let the people have the right 
over their own interest and happiness, and the top interest of 
the Hong Kong people is to maintain the region's prosperity and 
stability. 
  Only the Basic Law can satisfy the wish and demand of the 
compatriots in Hong Kong, and this is common knowledge among the 
people. 
  However, three months after Chris Patten was appointed 
governor of Hong Kong in June 1992, he put forward a "political 
bill", claiming to assume a moral responsibility for Hong Kong's 
democratization. 
  In the past one year and more, Governor Chris Patten has 
clung to his bill, taking no heed of the agreements and 
understandings reached between China and Britain and the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong. 
  People can hardly understand such practice by Chris Patten. 
Britain has governed Hong Kong for over 150 years during which 
it has never advocated democracy. 
  Why does the British side suddenly remember to give 
democracy 
to Hong Kong people when it is soon to end its rule over Hong 
Kong? 
  The Chinese side has reiterated time and again that over 150 
years of British rule over Hong Kong, the center of differences 
between China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue is not 
democracy, but of whether acting in good faith. 
  Democracy is an important symbol of social progress, and the 
Chinese Government has always given support to democratic reform 
in Hong Kong. 
  It is China which first proposed to implement a pattern of 
democracy of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and let the 
Hong Kong people to enjoy the democratic right of "high 
autonomy" in Sino-British talks in 1982. 
  Later, China spent four years and eight months to formulate 
"the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) of the People's Republic of China", which advocates the 
principle of "gradual and orderly progress for Hong Kong 
democratic reform". 
  In the world, all things have their own development rule and 
need a process of emergence, development and maturing. The same 
is true with the establishment of a democratic system. 
  For example, Britain and the United States spent 200 to 300 
years to realize their modern democratic reforms. 
  The democracy of Hong Kong cannot be fulfilled in one day. 
If things are done against the law of development, that would 
lead to turmoil and affect social stability. And further more 
that will not be conducive to the Hong Kong's investment 
environment. 
  Such a situation is surely not desired by the Hong Kong 
people. 
  Based on this, the Basic Law proposes that in the first ten 
years after 1997, the year for China to resume its sovereignty 
over Hong Kong, it will carry out both direct and indirect 
elections, and in 2007 a general election will be held according 
to a legal process. 
  The process of democratic reform in Hong Kong stipulated in 
the Basic Law has given full consideration to the wish of the 
Hong Kong people and is in keeping with the development law of 
democracy. 
  During the discussions of the Basic Law, the central 
government had listened extensively to opinions from various 
circles in Hong Kong. 
  The announcement of the Basic Law has won praise from people 
in Hong Kong, the mainland, and the world as whole. Even the 
British Government spoke highly of the law. 
  Among all the developments, Governor Chris Patten dished out 
his "political bill". 
  People who know the history of rule by colonialism can see 
the real purpose of Chris Patten is to help a group of 
pro-British persons to power, especially those who wish to 
challenge the central government, so as to make the government 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region powerless. 
  By doing so, Britain can reach its goal of continuing the 
colonialist rule over Hong Kong in another form. 
  The same old tricks had been used in some British colonies 
in 
Asia, Africa and Europe. The majority of the Hong Kong people 
are able to see through those tricks. 
  It is known to all that during the five years of drafting 
the 
Basic Law, China had carried out a very open and democratic way 
of discussions on all issues, especially on the method of 
selection of the chief executive of the government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and the forming of the 
Legislative Council. 
  The selection method for the chief executive of the Hong 
Kong 
SAR and forming of the Legislative Council are open and just, 
and are supported by the Hong Kong people. 
  In contrast, the "political bill" of Governor Chris Patten 
is 
not open and democratic. 
  Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in June 1992 and dished 
out 
his "political bill" in September. 
  Besides deliberations with the British Government, the bill 
was announced without consultation with the majority of the Hong 
Kong people. 
  In the transitional period before 1997, more and more Hong 
Kong people will see through the real purpose of the British 
authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with the people from 
the mainland for the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The Government of 
Hong Kong [HK] has decided to reduce the total money of the day 
(MOD) estimate for the key projects of the on-construction new 
airport by 5.5 billion HK dollars (705 million U.S. dollars), a 
government spokesman announced here today. 
  The cost will be reduced from 163.7 billion HK dollars (20.9 
billion U.S. dollars) to 158.2 billion HK dollars (20.2 billion 
U.S. dollars) due to the significant savings on the seven 
government key projects, which lowered by 7.6 billion HK dollars 
(974 million U.S. dollars) in the total amount of cost. 
  The cost-reduction has been made possible mainly by savings 
stemming from highly competitive tendering on a very 
cost-effective program, the spokesman said. 
  The local government has awarded 34 contracts worth a total 
of about 31.4 billion HK dollars (four billion U.S. dollars), 
representing 78 percent by value of the total government key 
projects. They have all been let below budget and are 
progressing well, he said. 
  However, the spokesman added, the real cost estimates, 
released in March 1991 prices, for the new airport at Chek Lap 
Kok and for the airport railway are unchanged because slight 
increases have been necessary for the cost borne by the 
provisional airport authorities and for the airport railway.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 7 (AFP)--Hong Kong's role as a 
portal for China's world trade will suffer a setback if Beijing 
and Washington fail to settle their dispute over textiles and 
garments soon, the government said Friday. 
  The Trade Department forecast no immediate impact from 
Thursday's announcement that the United States planned to slash 
China's textile and apparel quotas by 25 to 35 percent. 
  "But if a resolution is not reached in due course, 
re-exports 
of Chinese-made textiles and clothing to the United States will 
be affected," a department spokesman said. 
  It added that Hong Kong was "naturally concerned" whenever 
its two biggest trading partners were at loggerheads. 
  Well over 50 billion US dollars' worth of Chinese goods are 
re- exported through Hong Kong to various countries every year. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod, speaking to 
reporters, said the through-flow of Chinese goods would be 
"reduced somewhat" if the US sanctions go into place. 
  "It would also affect Hong Kong entrepreneurs' investments 
in 
China very directly," he added. 
  "But I think it's very early. They're very clearly in the 
middle of a negotiation and we'll have to see how it ends up." 
  US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the quota slash 
-- 
to take effect January 17 and retroactive to January 1 -- was in 
retaliation for Chinese-made goods that are shipped illegally 
via third countries to avoid US quotas. 
  Hong Kong is the biggest source of foreign investment in 
China, as well as a major trans-shipment point for goods made 
for export in the neighboring southern Chinese province of 
Guangdong. 
  Business analysts said the US action boded ill for the 
renewal in June of China's most favored nation trading status, 
which President Bill Clinton has decreed will be conditional on 
improvements in human rights. 
  Macleod has said that if MFN is revoked, Hong Kong's 
economic 
growth rate of about five percent could plunge by three 
percentage points, and that 70,000 jobs could perish.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Shanghai: "Deng Xiaoping Inspects </F>
Shanghai Commercial Street, and Ascends Yangpu Bridge in Wind 
and Rain"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 9 Jan (WEN WEI PO) -- Deng Xiaoping has 
appeared in public in Shanghai. As the evening lights were lit 
on New Year's Day, Deng Xiaoping, sitting in a car, inspected 
two of Shanghai's busy commercial streets, which had taken on a 
new look after thorough renovation. His car slowly drove past 
Nanjing road and Huaihai road, which were shining brilliantly 
with neon lights, to stop at the five-star New Jinjiang Hotel, 
from the top floors of which one can overlook the entire city. 
  According to a source who was at the site, at about 1900 on 
New Year's Day, accompanied by his family, Deng -- healthy and 
spry -- walked steadily into the spacious lobby of the New 
Jinjiang Hotel. Foreign guests staying at the hotel and people 
seeking diversions were strolling or chatting leisurely in the 
lobby, which was permeated with a warm and auspicious 
atmosphere. People congratulated themselves on their good luck 
to see personally the elegant demeanor of the chief architect of 
China's reform and openness. 
  As always, Deng Xiaoping came to Shanghai when winter began, 
and stayed at a hotel where he used to live every time he was in 
the municipality. Compared with previous years, he came earlier 
this year. It has been reported that, accompanied by his 
beloved daughter Mao Mao, Deng Xiaoping inspected the 
magnificent Yangpu Bridge on 13 December 1993. According to a 
reliable source, it was drizzling that day as his car drove to 
the cable-stayed bridge that stretches over the river, with the 
roaring winds audible inside the car. Even given these weather 
conditions, Deng Xiaoping, at his advanced age of 90, got out of 
the car in high spirits and, braving the wind and rain, walked 
steadily for more than 20 meters on the broad surface of the 
bridge, halting now and then to view the landscape on both 
shores of the Huangpu Jiang.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Lianqing (6392 6647 1987)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- While commenting the 
work of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu today, Premier Li 
Peng pointed out: All provinces, cities, and departments 
concerned should continue to strengthen their leadership in 
harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, carry forward the fine 
tradition of self-reliance, hard work, and unity in harnessing 
floods, guarantee that funds for such efforts are available in 
time, and create necessary material conditions for the work. It 
is necessary to mobilize people's enthusiasm in harnessing the 
Huai He and the Tai Hu and exert joint efforts to do a good job 
which will help eliminate the calamities, maintain a long period 
of peace and stability, and benefit the generations to come. 
  At the Third Work Meeting on Harnessing the Huai He and the 
Tai Hu which concluded today, State Councillor Chen Junsheng 
conveyed Premier Li Peng's abovementioned opinions. 
  In his concluding speech at the meeting, Chen Junsheng said: 
The project of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu has a 
direct bearing on the future economic development in the two 
valleys and on the whole situation of nationwide reform, 
opening, and socialist modernization drive. Therefore, 
governments at all levels in these areas and relevant 
departments of the central government should shoulder the 
historic task of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu with a 
great sense of responsibility. They should see to it to attain 
the set goal of achieving the initial results in harnessing the 
Huai He in the "eighth five-year" period and basically 
accomplishing the work in the "ninth five-year" period as well 
as basically accomplishing the work of harnessing the Tai Hu in 
the "eighth five-year" period. 
  Chen Junsheng said: The Huai He and Tai Hu valleys -- with a 
population of 143 million people, 200 million mu of farmland, 
and one sixth of total grain output in the country -- is China's 
main production base of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing seeds. 
This is one of the economically developed areas in China -- a 
golden area with a total industrial and agricultural output 
value accounting for one eighth of the country's total. But the 
Huai He valley suffers from severe droughts and floods, with 
fairly serious floods every three or four years. In 1991 alone, 
the economic losses caused by the floods of the Chang Jiang and 
the Huai He reached 48 billion yuan. If we do not speed up the 
harnessing work, inestimable life and property losses will occur 
again once great floods hit. 
  While talking about the first three-year work of harnessing 
the Huai He and the Tai Hu in the "eighth five-year" period, 
Chen Junsheng said: Among 18 backbone projects for harnessing 
the Huai He, 12 of them have been started, with an investment of 
2.235 billion yuan. Among 10 backbone projects for harnessing 
the Tai Hu, seven of them have been started, with an investment 
of 1.292 billion yuan. The construction of all projects goes on 
fairly smoothly, with some projects already playing their role 
in preventing floods. 
  Chen Junsheng said: The work of harnessing the Huai He and 
the Tai Hu will enter an all-out critical stage this year. 
Departments concerned should have a sense of urgency and 
strengthen their leadership in the work. For this year, the 
state's investment in the projects is 1.84 billion yuan, an 
increase of 50 percent over last year. Department concerned of 
the central government must ensure that such funds are available 
in time. Local governments also must guarantee the input of 
supplementary funds. 
  Chen Junsheng emphatically said: It is necessary for 
departments concerned to further strengthen leadership in the 
work of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, clarify their 
responsibilities, and carry out their duties. All relevant 
provinces and cities in the Huai He and the Tai Hu valleys 
should closely cooperate with each other and be united in 
harnessing the floods. They must follow the basic principle of 
taking the whole situation into consideration, be cooperative, 
and sharing burdens in their future efforts of harnessing the 
Huai He and the Tai Hu. Thanks to the efforts of the past 
several years in building water conservancy projects for 
harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, these projects will be 
put into operation one after another. All localities must 
attach great importance to the management of these projects so 
as to generate maximum results. Equal attention should be paid 
to project construction, management, and flood prevention. 
During the construction period, it is possible for floods to 
occur each year. Therefore, we should not relax efforts in all 
flood-prevention tasks. Effective measures should be made to 
repair the projects damaged by floods. We should be resolute in 
doing a good job in dredging river courses. We should guarantee 
that projects already accomplished are put into service on time 
so as to ensure safe flood seasons. 
  At the meeting, Minister Niu Maosheng of water resources 
talked about this year's goal of harnessing the Huai He and the 
Tai Hu. He said: It is imperative to launch a compressive drive 
to harness the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Huai He's 
main tributaries. We should open the passage of the middle 
reaches of the Huai He with all speed. All-out construction of 
the new river course for the Huaihong should begin so as to 
ensure its all-line completion in 1995. More efforts should be 
made in building projects for diverging river water to the east 
and the south, with a goal of accomplishing the first phase 
project in 1995. We should still focus the work of harnessing 
the Tai Hu on projects designed to diverge water of the Taipu 
He, the Wangyu He, and the Hangjia He to the south and ensure 
that these projects will be accomplished in 1995. Continued 
efforts should be made to build the dikes surrounding the Tai Hu 
and flood-prevention projects in east Shao Xi and west Shao Xi.

  [Text] While inspecting Heilongjiang Province, Li Ruihuan, 
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], 
said: Spring Festival is a traditional festival of the Chinese 
people. Before Spring Festival, the cadres at various levels 
should go to the grass roots -- particularly the enterprises and 
households experiencing difficulties -- hold heart-to-heart 
talks with the people, render service and express warmth to the 
people, support the poor, do solid deeds for the people, and 
help the people have a good festival. 
  From 4 to 7 January, accompanied by Sun Weiben, secretary of 
the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee; Shao Qihui, governor 
of the provincial government; and Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the 
provincial CPPCC committee, Li Ruihuan visited some state-owned 
large enterprises, institutions of higher learning, and 
scientific research institutes in the province to conduct 
investigations and to solicit their opinions. He heard the work 
report of the provincial party committee and fully affirmed the 
provincial party committee and government's achievements in 
guiding the broad masses of cadres and people to implement 
conscientiously the guidelines of the 14th party congress and 
the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee, to tide over difficulties, to promote 
economic development, and to safeguard social stability. 
  In regard to the current work, Li Ruihuan said: We should 
notice that the national current situation in various aspects is 
good. All localities are full of enthusiasm for engaging in 
construction and making developments. A faster economic growth 
rate has been maintained. The people's livelihood has 
noticeably improved. Simultaneously, we should clearly notice 
that some people still fail to improve rapidly their living 
conditions due to various reasons and some people are even 
confronted with some difficulties. We should always remember 
these people. We hope that the speed of construction will be 
faster and the scope of construction will be wider. In the 
final analysis, we do this in order to improve the people's 
livelihood. Therefore, in the course of construction, we should 
consider the interests of the people and particularly ensure 
that serious difficulties to the people's basic life do not 
result. 
  Li Ruihuan said: It is certain that reform will bring about 
benefits to the majority of the people. The reform measures 
relating to the readjustment of the interests of the people 
should thoroughly and cautiously be studied before 
implementation, strictly adhere with the changes of the 
situation after implementation, and be timely readjusted or 
supplemented if necessary. We should be concerned about the 
feelings of the people, conscientiously hear people's opinions, 
and strive to help the masses overcome difficulties. This is 
not only what the basic purpose of our communist party requires, 
but also a demand for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and 
opening up. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Spring Festival is also a juncture of the 
two years. We have the responsibility to help the people who 
have difficulties experience a good festival. The cadres at 
various levels should be aware of the people with difficulties, 
call on them, actively solicit their criticism and suggestions, 
urge them express their difficulties -- even words they are not 
pleased to hear, provide timely help, and try with every 
possible means to help them solve some practical problems. We 
should reduce other expenses and allocate necessary funds to 
ensure their needs in this aspect. 
  Li Ruihuan also met with the comrades of the provincial and 
Harbin city CPPCC committees and exchanged views on 
strengthening the establishment of democratic politics and the 
self-construction of the CPPCC.
