  [Text] Guangzhou, January 12 (CNS)--Guangzhou Municipality 
will see its economy continue its high-speed development this 
year, but at the same time inflation will increase its 
double-digit rate. Policy-makers in Guangzhou will take five 
measures to control prices, according to the Director of the 
municipal Planning Commission, Mr. Guo Xiling, speaking at a 
planning meeting today. 
  First, every effort will be made to maintain a balance 
between supply and demand and the implementation of preferential 
policies and other measures for the supply of vegetables, the 
area under cultivation of vegetables and the stability of food 
prices and supply of industrial products. 
  Second, state-owned stores will function as main marketing 
outlets so as to adjust the relationship between supply and 
demand and control prices. Departments handling grain will be 
required to take the lead in bringing prices down to normal. 
  Third, the regulatory fund for main foodstuffs will be 
increased and the reserves system for important goods improved 
in order to maintain stability of prices. 
  Fourth, price control will be strengthened in order to stop 
illegal price hikes and fund collection. 
  Fifth, legislation for prices will be drawn up and the 
management system for prices improved as quickly as possible. 
  Retail prices in the city last year increased by 24 percent 
while the municipal government has called for the growth of such 
prices this year to be held to within 15 percent.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Xingbo: "Foreign-Funded Firms Drive Growth in </F>
Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen--Foreign-funded enterprises in South 
China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have become a main force 
in its economic construction, yielding outstanding results last 
year. 
  The city used $1.04 billion in foreign funds from January to 
November, more than twice the figure in the same period of 1992, 
Shen Jing, an official with the city's Economic Development 
Bureau said last week. 
  Industrial output from foreign-funded firms was more than 29 
billion yuan ($3.33 billion), or 73 percent of the city's total. 
And the figure was 32 percent up on the same period in 1992, 
Shen said. 
  The firms exported goods worth more than $5 billion, an 
increase of 22.7 percent. That figure accounted for 69 percent 
of the city's total. 
  In 1993, foreign investment still focused on industrial 
programmes. However, more and more foreign businessmen invested 
increasing amounts of cash in tertiary industry. 
  In addition, Shen said, well-known entrepreneurs and 
international consortia began to turn their attention to the 
special economic zone. 
  "These investors, instead of investing on one specific item, 
moved into a variety of trade and professions in a bid to 
develop overall," he said. 
  Li Ka-shing, the richest entrepreneur in Hong Kong, helped 
Shenzhen establish the Shenzhen Chang Ho Industrial Company and 
he invested in many fields. 
  Last year, Li signed an investment agreement to help build 
Yantian Habour which involved huge amounts of cash from the Hong 
Kong side. 
  Kumagai Gumi, a well-known a Japanese firm, invested in 
electronic appliances and in putting up large commercial 
buildings. 
  To encourage foreign investment in the city, Shen said, a 
series of favourable policies and economic regulations were set 
up, which greatly invigorated economic activity. 
  According to a recent study, more than 80 percent of the 
foreign-funded enterprises in the city made profits. 
  All American-funded firms had annual profits of more than 15 
percent and over 50 percent of the companies recovered their 
investment. 
  The output of Huaqiang Sanyo Electronics, a Sino-Japanese 
joint venture, has increased by more than 1000 percent since it 
was set up 12 years ago. Its sales volume hit more than 1.4 
billion yuan ($160.92 million) last year. 
  In addition, Shen said, more than 120 foreign-funded 
enterprises were awarded Nationally Advanced Foreign-funded Firm 
titles. 
  In a related development, Shenzhen became China's highest 
exporting city for the first time last year. 
  It exported $7.2 billion-worth of products from January to 
November, up by 15.7 percent on the same period in 1992, said 
figures from the Trade Development Bureau. 
  The total figure for 1993 was expected to be $7.8 billion, 
up 
14.7 percent on the previous year. 
  The achievement was made possible by the work of more than 
400 foreign trade enterprises and foreign-funded firms as well 
as processors of imported materials, said a bureau spokesman. 
  Exports by foreign-funded enterprises totalled $5.1 billion, 
an increase of 22.6 percent. The figure for processing 
factories was $550 million, up by 14.9 percent, and exports to 
distant countries were $490 million, up 27.3 percent. 
  In addition, the spokesman said, 21 firms were allowed to 
set 
up overseas offices in new markets including Malaysia, 
Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. 
  The city also organized or participated in many fairs both 
at 
home and abroad last year.

  [Excerpts] A regional meeting on rural work opened in 
Nanning on 3 January. The theme of this meeting is to convey 
the guidelines laid down by the central meeting on rural work 
and to study and formulate measures to further emancipate 
people's minds, seize the opportunity, and speed up 
comprehensive agricultural, rural economic, and social 
development in the region. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the 
regional party committee, delivered an important speech at the 
meeting. 
  Zhao Fulin's speech focused on five topics: 1) Having a 
thorough understanding of the extreme importance of 
agricultural, rural, and agrarian issues under socialist market 
economy conditions; 2) the current situation in agriculture and 
rural work in the region; 3) emancipating people's minds, 
seizing the opportunity, and speeding up comprehensive 
agricultural, rural economic, and social development; 4) 
carrying out rural reform in depth, and speeding up the 
establishment of a rural economic operational mechanism which 
suits the needs of the socialist market economy; and 5) 
intensifying leadership over agriculture and rural work. 
[passage omitted] 
  Talking about the effort to speed up comprehensive 
agricultural, rural economic, and social development, Comrade 
Zhao Fulin pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate on 
the following aspects: With the market condition as a guide, we 
are to speed up the readjustment of the production structure in 
rural areas and optimize the allocation of resources; we are to 
vigorously develop township and town enterprises, accelerate the 
process of relocation of the rural labor force, and speed up 
construction of small cities and towns; we are to implement the 
development strategy of invigorating agriculture through 
promotion of education; we are to strengthen infrastructure for 
agriculture, improve production conditions, and preserve 
high-yield grain-growing farmland; we are to step up our effort 
to aid impoverished areas, enabling them to speed up their pace 
in extricating themselves from poverty and getting rich; and we 
are to step up the development of socialist spiritual 
civilization and of democracy and the legal system, and to do a 
good a job in comprehensive management of public security. 
  Referring to the effort to deepen rural reform and speed up 
the establishment of a rural economic operational mechanism 
which suits the needs of the socialist market economy, Comrade 
Zhao Fulin noted: We must heighten our sense of urgency to seize 
the opportunity to accomplish the reform. In view of the actual 
circumstances in this region, we must focus our attention on the 
following tasks: We are to further stabilize and perfect the 
responsibility system, mainly the contracted responsibility 
system on a household basis with remuneration to output, and the 
two-tier operational system characterized by integration of 
centralized management and independent operation. First of all 
we are to stabilize and perfect relations stemming from farmland 
management contracts; secondly, we are to perfect unified 
collective management system and strengthen its role of serving 
the peasants; meanwhile, we are to vigorously introduce various 
types of joint-stock systems and joint-stock cooperative 
systems, enhance rational allocation and combination of 
resources, vigorously promote the socialized service network in 
rural areas, and step up the establishment of an operational 
form featuring the integration of trade, industry, and 
agriculture, and of production, processing, and marketing. We 
are to establish a unified urban-rural market system, and 
gradually build up a great commodity circulation structure. We 
are to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and constantly intensify the government's role in 
macroscopic guidance and management of the rural economy. 
  Comrade Zhao Fulin stressed that party committees and 
governments at all levels must steadfastly place agriculture 
before all other economic tasks, earnestly strengthening 
leadership. In the meantime, the regional party committee and 
the regional people's government must devote great efforts to 
rural work, while prefectural, county, and city party 
committees, as well as prefectural administrative commissioners' 
offices and county and city governments, must focus on and 
devote most energy to rural work. Party committee secretaries 
and government leaders at all levels should constantly pay 
attention to and personally attend to rural work. When dealing 
with major issues concerning rural reform and development, they 
must personally conduct investigations and studies, before 
making decisions and adopting measures. And they must monitor 
the implementation of such measures thereafter. 
  More than 500 people, including principal persons-in-charge 
of various prefectures, cities, and counties, and leading 
comrades from departments concerned, attended the meeting. 
Present at the meeting were regional leaders Zhao Fulin, Cheng 
Kejie [provincial governor], Liu Mingzu, Ding Tingmo, Li 
Zhenqian, Lin Chaoqun, Li Enchao, Yuan Zhengzhong, Ma Qingsheng, 
Yang Jichang, He Bin, Lei Yu, Xu Bingsong, Lu Bing, Yuan 
Fenglan, Liu Hong, and Long Chuan.

  [Text] Nanning, January 12 (CNS)--In order to solve the 
contradiction between the rapid development of posts and 
telecommunications and the shortage of money, the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region is actively engaging in the introduction of 
foreign capital into this sector with some 11 separate amounts 
of foreign funds totaling U.S.$120 million so far approved to be 
used for this purpose. 
  According to the general engineer of the region's bureau of 
posts and telecommunications, Mr. Lin Mianyue, these foreign 
funds have come from financial organizations in Switzerland, 
Germany, Belgium, Finland and Canada as well as from the North 
European Investment Bank with the investments covering a big 
batch of items including 600,000 programme-controlled 
telephones, switchboards with 30,000 long-distance lines, a 
long-distance optical-fibre cable measuring 1700 kilometres, 3 
switchboard centres for mobile phones, 15 stations for paging 
machines, a programme-controlled system for the transmission of 
telegrams, ground satellite receiving stations and automatic 
letter-sorting systems. One-third of these items have already 
gone into hoperation and the rest will be completed within the 
coming two years. 
  Before the 1990s, Guangxi was very backward in the 
development of its posts and telecommunications and starting 
from 1992, the region has been introducing foreign capital and 
pledging investment in this sector in a large-scale way with the 
fixed assets investment last year alone put at RMB 1.3 billion, 
surpassing the original value of the fixed assets accumulated in 
the previous past 40 years. In 1993, the region saw the growth 
of its gross business volume and business income from this 
sector exceeding the country's average for the first time, 
ranking it fourth and second respectively in the country.

  [Text] Yesterday morning [5 January], provincial Secretary 
Li Changchun and Zhang Deguang, standing committee member of the 
provincial CPC committee and secretary of Zhengzhou City party 
committee, went to Songdai Village, Miaoli Township, Jinshui 
District, Zhengzhou City for investigation. They inspected 
Dayuan Iron and Steel Company Limited and Caili Aluminum Company 
Limited, both subsidiaries of Songdai Village Hengda Group 
Company. They listened to the report given by the leaders of 
Hengda Group Company. 
  Songdai Village is a natural village with a population of 
over 600. Guided by the talks given by Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
during his southern China tour and the spirit of the 14th 
National CPC Congress, the people in this village emancipated 
their minds, renewed their concepts, and boldly brought in 
talented people, technology, and funds. As a result, the 
village underwent marked changes. In 1993, the sales income of 
the village-run enterprises registered 120 million yuan and 
per-capita income for the year was over 3,000 yuan. 
  Li Changchun also had an amiable conversation with the eight 
college graduates employed by the company who are from inside 
and outside the province. 
  The college graduates said: The reason we came to Songdai 
Village Hengda Group Company is because this village has a 
united, practical, innovative, and enterprising leadership 
group. Here, we can bring our talents into full play and put 
our knowledge to practical use to realize the value of our life. 
  Li Changchun was very positive of their bold and wise 
choice. 
  After listening to reports, Li Changchun pointed out: Your 
village-run enterprises show that the ideas of the people in 
Songdai have changed a lot. It also indicates that township and 
town enterprises are a vast world where much can be 
accomplished. With the reform of the system of ownership and 
operational power, mixed economic sectors will be more and more 
common. It is necessary to break the established concept that 
township and town enterprises are inferior. In the future, no 
matter what ownership an enterprise is under, it must face 
market competition and excel. Township and town enterprises 
should be treated the same way as state-owned enterprises 
without discrimination in terms of enterprise categorization, 
grades of employment, and flow of professionals. Songdai 
Village is now a step ahead in accordance with the requirements 
of the establishment of socialist market economic system. It 
has attracted capable people and helped the whole society 
understand the value of capable people in a new light. I hope 
Zhengzhou City will take the first step in this respect and, in 
accordance with the principles of market economy, formulate a 
set of measures that encourage the rational flow of scientific 
and technological personnel. 
  Li Changchun instructed Songdai Village Hengda Group Company 
to develop toward foreign orientation, high-technology, and 
integration; strive to upgrade its standards, increase 
varieties, and improve quality; proceed from reality and make a 
long-term and scientific plan; and make painstaking efforts in 
implementation. He also expressed the hope that Songdai Village 
will try to catch up with and surpass the star villages in the 
province in sophistication and efficiency and become one of the 
province's advanced enterprises as soon as possible.

  [Text] Yesterday [1 January], provincial Secretary Wang 
Maolin and provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu delivered a New Year 
message. 
  The message said: Under the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, we Hunan 
people, together with the people of all nationalities in the 
country, enter the new year with confidence and hopes of 
speeding up reform and development. The past year has seen us 
building up socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the 
guidance of the important talks of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. We have achieved considerable results in all our 
undertakings. In economy we maintained a relatively good 
momentum of development. The provincial GNP reached 114 billion 
yuan, up 12.6 percent over the previous year. The 15 years 
between the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee and the end of last year has been a period of great 
reform, opening up, and development for Hunan, and a period 
which witnessed the fast growth of Hunan's economic strength, 
the biggest changes in the urban and rural outlook, and the 
greatest practical benefits for the general public, since the 
founding of New China. 
  The brilliant achievements we have scored are a sound 
foundation on which we can continue our pursuit in triumph. In 
the new year, we must hold high the great theoretical banner of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the 
party's basic line, implement the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and that of the sixth 
enlarged plenary session of the sixth provincial CPC committee, 
further emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity, work with 
less constraint on speeding up reform and development, and make 
more good results and create more brilliant records.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gai Leiping (5556 7191 1627): "The Causes of </F>
the Baohe Coal Mine Explosion Have Been Verified"] 
  [Text] It is learned from a related department that the 
causes of the explosion in Baohe Coal Mine of Heilongjiang's 
Jixi City, Jidong County have already been verified, and the 
cases of the relevant persons held responsible have also been 
dealt with. 
  The Baohe Coal Mine is a county-run, state-owned coal mine 
under Jidong County's jurisdiction. The No. 1 Pit is one with a 
high concentration of gas, with an annual production capacity of 
120,000 tonnes and approximately 1,000 workers and staff. At 
1904 on 11 October 1993, the mine's control center discovered an 
interruption in power supply, and shortly afterward an explosion 
was heard from the pit's entrance, and yellow smoke billowed 
out; consequently all 70 workers on that shift were killed in 
the accident. 
  Based on the investigation, evidence obtained, analysis, and 
appraisal of relevant experts of the case fact-finding group, it 
was verified that there had been an extraordinarily big 
explosion involving coal dust. The direct cause was that during 
work to expand the right 10-degree upward-sloping work face, a 
fan stopped working and resulted in an accumulation of gas; when 
explosives were used to widen the work face, a short circuit 
caused a spark that finally brought about a gas explosion. 
  In addition, the confusion in production safety and 
technological control of the Baohe Coal Mine was also a cause. 
The ventilation system in the first section of No. 1 Pit was 
suffering from a serious leak; in the second section there was a 
serious lack of ventilation. Arrangements at the work face were 
confused, and overlapped each other; consequently, when the 
accident took place, the whole pit was involved. The 
concentration of gas in the pit exceeded the limit for four 
consecutive days on 8, 9, 10, and 11 October. The gas monitor 
on duty on the shift at the right 10-degree upward-sloping work 
face possessed no certificate, while in blasting, the system of 
"three checks for each blast" was not adhered to. Some 
self-rescue equipment was not provided and some was not used 
according to the rules and regulations. As a result, when the 
accident took place, miners in the pit could not rescue 
themselves. 
  Another gas explosion took place in the very same pit on 2 
January 1991, killing 53 and injuring 12. The provincial, city, 
and county labor administration mine security supervising 
organizations carried out a special check of the said mine 
toward the end of 1991, and a notice on the supervision opinions 
was issued; however, they were not implemented. 
  In the wake of the recent accident, the State Council, 
Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee and Government, the 
Ministry of Labor, the All-China Federation of Workers' Trade 
Unions, and the Ministry of Coal Industry have paid great 
attention to and shown great concern about it. The provincial 
and city governments as well as related departments promptly 
organized a joint investigation. While verifying the causes of 
the accident, in order to draw a lesson and further implement 
the "Mining Safety Act," the penalty of an administrative 
warning was meted out to the Jixi vice mayor in charge of 
industry and a Jidong County vice governor; an administrative 
demerit was meted out to the county coal bureau director and 
chief engineer; a major administrative demerit was meted out to 
Wang Binwu [3769 3521 2976], deputy director of the Baohe Mine 
in charge of electrical machinery; the administrative penalty of 
removal from office was meted out to Baohe Mine director Yin 
Dianjia [1438 3031 3094], and in addition it was suggested that 
a corresponding penalty be given within the party; and the 
administrative penalty of removal from office was meted out to 
Baohe Mine deputy director Han Guohua [7281 0948 5478], who was 
in charge of production, technology, ventilation, and safety 
work, Sun Yishu [1327 5030 2579], ventilation section chief, and 
Wu Xiuwang [0702 4423 4986], deputy pit director, who was in 
charge of production safety in No. 1 Pit, while their cases 
would be submitted to supervision organizations for 
investigation. Regarding No. 1 Pit director Yang Zhongcheng 
[2799 1813 6134] and Liu Chunsheng [0491 2504 3932], safety 
monitor on duty who was absent during the shift, their cases 
were filed and submitted to supervision organizations for 
examination.

  [Excerpts] At a forum of representatives from the nonpublic 
economic sector, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, said that it is necessary to manage things in line 
with the market economic law and create a good and relaxed 
environment for developing and expanding private enterprises. 
In the market economy, private enterprises should pay attention 
to studying the market law and the state's industrial policies, 
submit themselves to the state marcoeconomic regulation and 
control and make new contributions to building a developed 
border province near the sea. 
  This morning, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party 
committee; Zhang Yueqi, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and vice governor; Wang Guofa, vice governor; and 
Zhang Tienan, vice chairman of the provincial committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and 
director of the United Front Work Department of the provincial 
party committee, invited representatives from the nonpublic 
economic sector to a forum to hear their opinions and

management; rely on the masses of workers; strengthen democratic 
management; place themselves among the workers; pay attention to 
self-cultivation and professional ethics; form a good social

  [Text] The province has began carrying out reform of the 
public servants system and the wage system, a part of the reform 
of party and government organizations with which the people have 
long been concerned. On the morning of 12 January, the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government held a 
work conference in Shenyang to make overall arrangements for 
this reform. Yu Junbo, standing committee member of the 
provincial party committee and director of the organizational 
department of the provincial party committee, presided over the 
conference. Wen Shizhen, standing committee member of the 
provincial party committee and vice governor of the province, 
set forth the guiding ideology, principles, tasks, methods, and 
steps for the reform of the public servants system and the wage 
system on behalf of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government. 
  Wen Shizhen pointed out that the next step of the reform of 
party and government organizations at the provincial, city, and 
county levels is devoted to firmly implementing the various 
programs approved by the CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee. In line 
with the demands of the central authorities and with the 
stipulations of the provincial plan on organizational reform, 
the number of party and government organizations at the 
provincial level should be reduced from 90 to 65, with their 
functionaries reduced by about 1,800 persons, or a reduction of 
22.6 percent; the number of party and government organizations 
at the city level should be reduced from 74 on an average to 52 
for each city, with functionaries reduced by 24,000 persons, or 
a reduction of 24.8 percent; and the number of party and 
government organizations at the county level should be reduced 
from 53.5 on an average to about 28 for each county, with the 
functionaries reduced by 5,700 persons, or a reduction of 21.5 
percent. The reform of institutions should be carried out in 
line with respective characteristics according to the forms of 
removal, incorporation, transfer, and [words indistinct]. 
Efforts should be made to reduce by 10 to 20 percent the number 
of the staff of institutions that live off state revenues. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to basically complete the 
reform of party and government organizations at the city level 
within two years. 
  With regard to the implementation of the public servants 
system, Wen Shizhen said, "It should take about two years to 
basically set up the public servants system throughout the 
province, while carrying out the reform of party and government 
organizations and the reform of the wage system in order to 
bring the personnel management of government at all levels into 
a new operational mechanism and in order to gradually perfect 
the management of government personnel." 
  The provincial government organizations will implement the 
public servants system by three stages and in groups. In the 
first half of this year, they will complete the installation of 
positions. By the end of this year, they will complete the 
transition of existing personnel to public servants and use a 
new personnel management operational mechanism. By the first 
half of next year, most cities in the province will set up their 
public servants system. 
  The wage system reform of party and government 
organizations, 
as well as institutions, should be carried out in line with the 
demand of building the socialist market economic system and with 
the principles of distribution according to work and linking 
work remunerations with practical contributions in order to 
overcome egalitarianism. At the same time, these organizations 
and institutions should gradually set up their wage system with 
their own characteristics and set up a normal wage increase 
system to help form and develop a classified management system 
and a effective incentive system. 
  Wen Shizhen demanded that in carrying out the reform of the 
wage system, we should seize the key points, clearly understand 
and master the stipulations of policies, and be meticulous in 
organizing implementation in order to basically complete the 
implementation task for the wage system reform of party and 
government organizations and institutions in the first half of 
this year. 
  Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, made a speech at the conference. He stressed, "In 
line with the demand of the market economy, we should vigorously 
seize the key point -- changing functions -- in carrying out the 
reform of labor, employment, and distribution systems." He said 
that changing the functions of government is the key point of 
the organizational reform. If the government refuses to change 
its functions and continues to use its original management modes 
and forms, it will be unable to bring the relations between the 
various sectors into better balance, to reduce the number of 
organizations and staff, and to improve administrative 
efficiency. 
  Wang Huaiyuan pointed out that the simultaneous reform of 
labor, employment, and distribution systems will cause grave 
difficulties and great influence and thus it is a major event 
having a bearing on the overall political and economic situation 
of the province. He demanded that all levels of party 
committees and governments should strengthen organization and 
leadership, make overall arrangements and plans, and be 
meticulous in organization so that they can carry out reform in 
a positive and sound manner.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- China's capital 
retained a two-digit economic growth rate last year as it took 
bold strides in overhauling its infrastructure and developing a 
new market. 
  According to official figures, the city reached a 12 percent 
growth in gross domestic product (GDP), the second successive 
year of over ten percent growth. 
  The city saw the so far fastest rate of construction last 
year. Partially tempted by the city's unsuccessful bid to host 
the Olympic Games, it hugely boosted investment in 
infrastructure work. The 10.2-billion government funds 
[currency not specified] went to various projects, including 
highways, flyovers, telephone switch-gear, power, gas and 
heating stations, as well as sewage and rubbish disposal plants 
and green land. 
  Foreign funds played a major role in renovating the run-down 
areas of the city. A total of 900 million U.S. dollars of 
overseas investment flowed into the city in 1993, of which 70 
percent went into infrastructure construction and service 
industries. 
  As the economy grew, the citizens' income increased. The 
average per capita income reached 5,500 yuan, 24.4 percent 
higher than in 1992. Its growth rate beat the inflation rate by 
eight percentage points. 
  Policemen received the greatest increase in income last 
year. 
They earned an average of 6,086 yuan annually, up nearly 40 
percent over the previous year. They were followed by 
enterprise workers, who earned an average of 5,955 yuan, up 25.7 
percent over 1992, school teachers who earned an average of 
5,638 yuan, up 36.6 percent, and government employees with an 
annual average of 5,482, up 33 percent. 
  The inflation rate stood at 16.9 percent for the year, 
according to official statistics. 
  The capital city speeded up the development of a new market 
system. It has pushed four state-owned enterprises onto the 
international market by issuing their shares abroad. 
  It continued the process of replacing the old 
government-sponsored housing system with a more market-dependent 
housing scheme. A total of 120,000 apartments were sold at 
their market price last year, a four-fold increase over 1992.

  [Text] Taiyuan, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The development of 
rural industrial towns in north China's Shanxi Province is 
growing in momentum. 
  At present, there are 150 towns in the coal-rich province 
whose annual output value has exceeded 100 million yuan each. 
  The rural industry in the province constitutes six pillar 
trades: coal processing, metallurgy, machinery, light textiles, 
chemicals and processing of agricultural side-line products. 
  Rural industries have also set up a few major production 
bases including a heating radiator base in Qingxu County, an 
active carbon base in Datong city and a forgeable iron base in 
Taigu County. 
  The rural towns with 100-million-yuan output value boosted 
the development of rural industry in the province. Last year, 
the total output value and pre-tax profits of the rural 
enterprises reached 68.6 billion yuan and 7.5 billion yuan, 
respectively increasing by 70 and 52.9 percent over the previous

  [Text] The Tianjin branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank of 
the ROK began business on 29 December. Before the opening 
ceremony, Mayor Zhang Lichang met with Mr. Yi Chang-U, first 
vice president of the Foreign Exchange Bank. He first extended 
congratulations to the Foreign Exchange Bank of the ROK for 
establishing a branch bank in Tianjin on behalf of the municipal 
government. He said: Tianjin has speedily accelerated its pace 
in opening to the outside world and foreign investments have 
increased by 100 percent. We welcome banking organs from all 
countries to establish organs in Tianjin and we are certain they 
will thrive here. 
  The Tianjin branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank of the ROK 
is 
the first branch bank of the ROK in China. The Foreign Exchange 
Bank is one of the major banks of the ROK with 238 branch banks 
and subbranches. The opening of this branch bank will play an 
active role in encouraging ROK business to expand investments in 
Tianjin. Zhang Lichang said: I have just returned from a visit 
to the ROK with the municipal government delegation. The warm 
and friendly reception the ROK national assembly speaker and 
some ministers of the government gave to the delegation left a 
profound impression on me. We have established friendly city 
relations with Inchon city. The ROK has speedily increased 
investments in Tianjin and the inauguration of the Tianjin 
branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank has shortened the distance 
between us. I am full of confidence in the prospects of 
cooperation. Mr. Yi Chang-U said: Through the municipal 
government delegation's visit to the ROK led by Mayor Zhang 
Lichang, the friendly contacts between the ROK and Tianjin will 
be further strengthened. Our branch bank in Tianjin will 
contribute to the two countries, and, in particular, to the 
economic development of the ROK and Tianjin. 
  After the meeting, Mayor Zhang Lichang; Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK 
ambassador to China; and Mr. Yi Chang-U, first vice president of 
the Foreign Exchange Bank, cut the ribbon to mark the opening of 
the Tianjin branch of the ROK Foreign Exchange Bank. Zhang 
Lichang and ROK Ambassador Hwang Pyong-tae held talks on 
strengthening cooperation. Vice Mayor Ye Disheng and responsible 
persons of departments concerned also attended the meeting and 
the opening ceremony.

  [Text] Prior to the convocation of the second enlarged 
plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, the 
Tianjin Municipal party committee invited principal responsible 
persons of various democratic parties to a forum on 22 December 
to solicit their opinions on the "draft 1994 work priorities of 
the Tianjin Municipal party committee," and to jointly discuss 
Tianjin's major plans of seizing the opportunity to accelerate 
development. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
presided over the forum. 
  Zhang Lichang and Li Jianguo, deputy secretaries of the 
municipal party committee; Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the 
municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference; Fang Fengyou, member of the standing 
committee of the municipal party committee; and responsible 
comrades of the United Front Work Department of the municipal

  Gao Dezhan said: In 1993, our municipality has 
conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee under the leadership of the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, persisted in taking 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as guidance and achieved noticeable 
results in reform and the modernization drive and in all fields 
of work through the common efforts of the people across the 
municipality. In carrying out all fields of work this year, 
various democratic parties, the municipal Federation of Industry 
and Commerce and relevant mass organizations in our municipality 
have provided great support for the municipal party committee 
and the municipal government, actively participated in 
consultation of major political affairs, aired their views 
frankly and played an important role in promoting Tianjin's 
reform, construction, and development. 
  Gao Dezhan said: Persisting in conducting consultation 
before making major policy decisions has been the fine tradition 
of our municipality and the major measure for guaranteeing the 
scientific and democratic policymaking of our municipal party 
committee and the municipal government. Inviting responsible 
comrades of various democratic parties, the Federation of

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has undertaken a 
major personnel reshuffle aimed at maintaining stability in the 
post-Deng Xiaoping era. At a secret enlarged meeting of the 
Central Military Commission (CMC) on December 18 and 19, the top 
brass also agreed to implement the long-stalled decision to 
demobilize up to half a million soldiers. Moreover, senior 
officers have taken steps to restore military relations with 
America by dispatching Executive Vice-Chief of Staff General Xu 
Huizi to the United States in the spring. 
  Chinese sources said yesterday the personnel changes which 
began late last month were the most extensive since the 
reshuffle of the leadership of the seven military regions in 
1990. They said, aside from rejuvenation and 
professionalisation, the CMC wanted to achieve a factional 
balance to ensure support for the post-Deng leadership with 
President Jiang Zemin as its "core." 
  A number of officers believed to be close to disgraced chief 
political commissar General Yang Baibing have been purged. 
Commander of the crucial Beijing Military Region, General Wang 
Chengbin has retired in favour of one of his deputies, General 
Li Laizhu. Considered a modernisation-minded professional, 
General Li served in the Tianjin region before becoming 
vice-commander of the Beijing region in 1985. 
  The most politically sensitive move took place in the 
Chengdu 
Military Region with the removal of Political Commissar General 
Zhang Gong, a crony of General Yang's. General Zhang, a 
spokesman for the Martial Law Command guarding Beijing in 
mid-1989, has been replaced by General Zhang Zhijian, another 
vice-commander of the Beijing Military Region. 
  General Tao Bojun has been appointed a vice-commander of the 
Guangzhou Military Region, which will play a significant role in 
the stationing of troops in Hong Kong after 1997. A chief of 
staff of the regional command since 1992, General Tao is 
considered a rising star. He accompanies CMC Vice-Chairman 
General Liu Huaqing on his ongoing tour of Thailand and 
Indonesia. Other personnel movements in units including the 
Nanjing and Shenyang military regions are expected in the near 
future. 
  Within PLA headquarters, the most thorough-going changes 
have 
hit the General Political Department, considered a power base of 
General Yang's. Two assistant directors, General Du Tiehuan and 
General Xu Caihou, have been promoted vice-directors. It is 
believed that prior to and after the fall of General Yang, a 
number of his colleagues, including the incumbent 
Director-General Yu Yongbo, have switched allegiance and 
professed loyalty to President Jiang. 
  At the General Logistics Department, which is headed by 
Jiang 
loyalist Fu Quanyou, General Zhou Youliang has replaced the 
retiring vice-director General Li Lun. General Zhou has since 
1988 been head of the Army's Department of Capital Construction 
and Barracks. 
  An informed source said patriarch Mr Deng was anxious that 
the Army, led by Mr Jiang in his capacity as CMC chairman, would 
help the leadership defuse political "contradictions" that would 
arise in the course of radical market reforms in the mid-199Os. 
He said while Mr Deng had used his influence to prop up Mr 
Jiang, the patriarch had sought to keep a factional balance 
within the PLA. "The purge of the so-called Yang Clan has been 
less severe than expected," the source said. "Several officers 
who have gained promotions, including General Zhang Zhijian, a 
former head of the Beijing Municipal Garrison were once allies 
of General Yang." 
  Another decision made at the CMC was to start the 
demobilisation of as many as half a million soldiers in 1994. 
While the decision to trim the 3.2 million-strong PLA was taken 
in 1991, only token numbers of divisions and personnel had been 
cut. 
  Western military analysts said the CMC had this time bitten 
the bullet because of rising costs, difficulty in recruitment, 
as well as the improvement of ties with former adversaries 
including Russia, Vietnam and India. "Costs saved by 
demobilisation will be pumped into the armaments modernisation 
programme," a Western diplomat said. It is understood a 
sizeable portion of the demobilised soldiers would be absorbed 
by the para-military People's Armed Police, as well as new 
law-enforcement entities such as urban "patrol police" units and 
anti-riot squads. 
  Meanwhile, the army leadership has decided to reciprocate 
overtures made by the American military by sending a high-level 
officer to the U.S. Sources close to the PLA said General Xu 
would probably make his trip after the Lunar New Year. A 
Vice-Chief of the General Staff Department since 1985, General 
Xu, an expert on training and equipment, has visited the U.S. 
before. 
  Diplomatic sources said General Xu's visit was the result of 
a partial thaw in bilateral military ties achieved during a trip 
to Beijing last November by the Assistant Secretary of Defence, 
Charles Freeman. Aside from the resumption of top-level visits, 
Mr Freeman and his hosts discussed the setting up of a bilateral 
committee on military co-operation. 
  It is understood an American Defence Department official 
will 
be visiting Beijing later this month to discuss the frame of 
reference of this committee. "The co-operation committee will 
steer clear of sensitive issues such as weapons sales or the 
transfer of military technology," a source said. "It is likely 
the American side will help the PLA in the transformation of 
military factories into facilities for producing civilian 
goods." The source said the top brass was hopeful that the 
Chinese Army might again tap U.S. expertise in modernising its 
weapons.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The PLA has 
up to now opened scores of its military bases, barracks, and 
military academies to foreign visitors. 
  The PLA opened its first army unit to foreign visitors in 
1955. Since China introduced reform and the open policy, the PLA 
has continued to open a number of ground force, navy, and air 
force bases and barracks to foreign visitors. Many foreign 
heads of state, government leaders, and military delegations 
have visited PLA bases and barracks. 
  The Academy of Military Sciences and the PLA National 
Defense 
University have become important channels for academic exchanges 
between PLA military academies and their foreign counterparts. 
Since its founding in early 1985, the PLA National Defense 
University has followed the principle of "looking toward the 
world, the future, and modernization" advocated by Deng 
Xiaoping. It has treated the principle as a principle for 
developing itself and displayed enthusiasm in opening up. Up to 
now the university has conducted academic exchanges with army 
units and military academies of over 50 foreign countries.

Heping (3163 0735 1627): "Strategic Topic of Great 
Significance-- Commenting on All-Army Inheritance and 
Development of Fine Traditions of the People's Liberation Army"] 
  [Text] Yesterday--today--tomorrow. 
  Sixty-six springs, summers, autumns, and winters. Sixty-six 
years of wind and rain. Why is the People's Liberation Army, 
which has undergone various hardships and difficulties, always 
full of vigor and vitality? When you meet these crack troops 
you will sense their uniquely brilliant spirit. This spirit is 
the true color [ben se 2609 5331] of the old Red Army men and 
the fine traditions of our Armed Forces. It is precisely 
because they possess this spirit that our armed forces can 
overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles and can always 
march forward courageously. 
<H3>  How Can Our Armed Forces Always Be Invincible in Times of 
Peace? One Thing in the Basic Experience Is: Maintaining the 
Fine Traditions. </H3>
  Peaceful cities. Warm and fragrant rural areas. The country 
is prosperous and at peace and the people live in happiness. 
Peace is the hope of the people. Did not numerous martyrs give 
up their lives precisely for peace today? Peace is not easy to 
come by and should be treasured. 
  To the Armed Forces, peace is also a kind of test. Troops 
can be defeated in wars and they can also be defeated in a 
peaceful environment. 
  In the past century, the Eight Banners Troops of the Qing 
Dynasty were once "as powerful as a thunderbolt and moved as 
speedily as the wind." However, in times of peace, they went 
downhill. Their former agility and bravery were replaced by 
boastfulness and weakness. Crack troops became people who 
indulged in playing with caged birds. 
  Lessons should be drawn from history. How should our armed 
forces guard against corruption and degeneration under new 
historical conditions? An important question which has a 
bearing on the existence and survival and the rise and success 
of our armed forces is put before the leadership of the Military 
Commission. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has concerned himself very much with 
the building of our armed forces. On many occasions he 
earnestly asked the armed forces to carry forward the fine 
traditions and to maintain the natural color of the old Red Army 
men. On the eve of the 14th CPC National Congress, he again 
expressed this hope to the Armed Forces. 
  It is true that the fine traditions of our Armed Forces, 
which give expression to the unique style and features of the 
People's Army, are the quintessence of the history of our Armed 
Forces. With such traditions, our Armed Forces were able to 
stand against powerful enemies in the years of war and to resist 
the "sugar-coated bullets" after they were garrisoned in cities 
and towns. Today, our Armed Forces can still depend on their 
fine traditions to stand the test in a peaceful environment and 
to always establish themselves in an unassailable position. 
  The CPC Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, have attached 
great importance to this exhortation by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
Comrade Jiang Zemin generalized the fine traditions of our 
Armed Forces into 10 aspects and made systematic and profound 
expositions. He asked the whole Army to raise the education on 
fine traditions to a height in keeping with our times and to put 
it in a strategic position. After that, Comrades Liu Huaqing 
and Zhang Zhen also wrote the important article entitled: 
"Carrying Forward the Fine Traditions Is an Important Question 
of a Strategic Nature in the Building of Our Army in the New 
Situation." Immediately afterward, the General Political 
Department complied and issued some teaching materials entitled: 
"Carry Forward the Fine Traditions, Maintain the True Color of 
the Old Red Army." 
  As a result, the education on fine traditions has become a 
common practice throughout the Army. A powerful spiritual 
motive force has thus been added to the strong and healthy body 
of our Armed Forces, making them even more vigorous. 
<H3>  New Times, New Tasks--Only by Integrating the Fine 
Traditions With the Spirit of the Times Can They Add Radiance to 
One Another and Shine With Dazzling Splendor. </H3>
  The world is in a historical period of great changes. The 
reform, opening up, and economic construction in our country are 
entering a new stage of development. We are living in such 
times. 
  New times, new tasks. Are fine traditions still useful at 
present? Fine traditions are faced with new challenges. Fine 
traditions can have great vitality only if the spirit of the 
times is added to them. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has advocated the 
"five kinds of revolutionary spirit" among the whole party and 
the entire Armed Forces. Comrade Jiang Zemin has also put 
forward the 64- character pioneering spirit. Fine traditions 
have been given a new connotation of the times and the spirit of 
the times has been infused into the quintessence of fine 
traditions. The organic integration of the two has produced a 
tremendous propelling force in the building of our Armed Forces. 
  The first indication is: Leading bodies at all levels have 
become stronger and more effective in improving the party's work 
style and in promoting clean administration. Leading cadres at 
all levels have enthusiastically responded to the call of the 
Central Military Commission leadership, gradually understood the 
contents of the 10 aspects of the fine traditions of our Armed 
Forces, proceeded from upholding the party's absolute leadership 
over the Armed Forces and, upholding the goal of wholeheartedly 
serving the people, earnestly tried to solve existing problems 
in the use of cadres, the use of power, the building of clean 
administration, and the leadership work style, and 
conscientiously undergone the tests involving "power, money, and 
beautiful women." 
  The second indication is: Grass-roots officers and soldiers 
have gradually established a correct outlook on life and a sense 
of value and the cohesive force of the Armed Forces has 
apparently increased. When "contrast between the Army and 
various localities" was a hot topic of discussion among the 
people, and some officers and soldiers had some doubts about the 
value of life, the education of fine traditions showed its 
unique might. The education on the outlook on life and the 
sense of value has been conducted throughout the Army in a 
lively and down-to-earth manner. Being faced with the 
achievements of revolutionary martyrs, the officers and solders 
have gradually tended to acquire a balance between individual 
interests and the interests of the revolution, conscientiously 
engaged in hard work, become willing to make contribution and 
sacrifice, and energetically made contributions to the 
modernization of our Armed Forces. 
  The third indication is: The fulfillment of various tasks 
centering around military training has been enhanced and 
fighting capacity has markedly increased. The aim of the 
education on traditions is to increase the fighting capacity. 
All units of the Armed Forces have made efforts to enable the 
education on traditions to permeate various tasks centering 
around military training and to foster in the Armed Forces the 
revolutionary spirit of bearing hardships, doing hard work, 
fearing no difficulties, and a willingness to shed blood and 
make sacrifices. One all-powerful unit after another has left 
its barracks to temper itself in the vast open country, high 
mountains, thick forests, blue skies, boundless oceans, deserts, 
and snowy plains. 
<H3>  Fine Traditions Are Not Genetic Factors and Are Not 
Automatically Inherited. The Valuable Thing Regarding 
Traditions Lies in "Passing On." </H3>
The number of old comrades who have participated in war has 
become smaller and smaller. How can the fine traditions of our 
Armed Forces be passed on and carried forward from generation to 
generation? A comrade with much foresight made this wonderful 
remark: Fine traditions are not genetic factors in nature and 
are not automatically inherited. The valuable thing regarding 
traditions lies in "passing on." "Passing on" has become a 
figurative term in carrying forward fine traditions throughout 
the Army. 
  Earnestly practice what one preaches -- "passing on." 
Answering the call of the Central Military Commission 
leadership, large numbers of old comrades who are still working 
or who have retired have come to give lectures on, and pass on, 
the traditions to young officers and soldiers of the Armed 
Forces. This is the most convincing education on traditions and 
is also the most effective way to pass on experience, give help, 
and set an example. This is a kind of gratifying natural 
replacement: The fine traditions of our Armed Forces, like 
relay batons, are being passed on from the hands of the old 
comrades into the hands of officers and soldiers of the new 
generation. 
  "Passing on" through exerting a subtle influence on others. 
An outstanding characteristic in the education on traditions is 
to make use of visible and tangible rich historical material, 
concrete historical remains, and important cultural relics so 
that the officers and soldiers will be imperceptibly influenced 
by what they constantly see and hear and benefit by them. 
Because of this, all units of the Armed Forces have seriously 
grasped the construction of hardware for the education on 
traditions. One book after another has been written to be used 
as teaching material, one military history exhibition hall after 
another has been built, and one room of honor after another has 
been renovated in companies. This visible work has created an 
invisible atmosphere so that the fine traditions of our Armed 
Forces are found at all time and everywhere. They are like 
spring rains at night, silently moistening the hearts of the 
cadres and fighters and exerting a subtle influence on them. 
  Constantly "passing on." What should be stressed in the 
education on traditions is to carry it out constantly. Many 
units have combined such education with routine work, carried 
out such education in good time in view of tendentious problems, 
and taken advantage of major festive activities to carry out 
such education. In each barracks, people can see that officers 
and soldiers often read books on fine traditions, sing songs 
about fine traditions, tell stories about fine traditions, and 
watch films and teleplays on fine traditions. Such incessant 
instillation has enabled the officers and soldiers to constantly 
deepen their understanding of fine traditions and to turn these 
traditions into conscious actions. 
  Let the tree of fine traditions of our Armed Forces remain 
green forever.

  [Text] China should agree to expert meetings "in the very 
near future" to sort out the problem of Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) passports, the office of the British Joint Liaison 
Group (JLG) team leader, Hugh Davies, said yesterday. A 
statement said he had been waiting for months for a Chinese 
response to comprehensive proposals forwarded to Beijing. 
London had also offered again without responses to send 
Director of Immigration Laurence Leung Mingyin to Beijing for 
talks. 
  Governor Chris Patten yesterday said: "In view of what's 
being said about people going to Beijing, I'd just like to make 
that absolutely clear and say that, alas, we haven't had a 
positive response yet. 
  "But I very much hope that Director Lu Ping's remarks 
yesterday, coming as they do after what we've been saying for 
the last few months, represent a Chinese response which (we) 
will be able to follow up, because it is the sort of area where 
we should be able to co-operate in the interests of (the) people 
of Hong Kong on an issue about which everybody feels very 
strongly." 
  Mr. Lu said yesterday China wanted to issue SAR passports 
before the 1997 change-over and appealed for Britain's 
co-operation in supplying information. The British JLG 
statement said Mr Lu's remarks were "noted with interest". 
  Following agreement on transitional arrangements for the 
continued validity after July 1, 1997 of existing travel 
documents issued by the Hong Kong Government, Britain had put 
detailed and comprehensive proposals to China on July 15 last 
year. "Our proposals dealt with such issues as eligibility 
criteria, types of travel document and period of validity." The 
statement said the British side had sought detailed expert 
discussions on these matters as soon as possible so that the 
documents could be issued immediately from July 1, 1997.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Chien-ping [7115 1696 1627]: "Lu Ping </F>
Says That Cutting Apart Airport Project by Hong Kong Government 
Is Bound To Increase Costs"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of 
the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said here 
today that facts have proved that the British Hong Kong 
Government has not separated politics from the economy. The 
British Hong Kong Government has adopted a non-cooperative 
attitude toward the Chinese side on the issue of the new airport 
in Hong Kong. When airport talks can be resumed has become a 
question, and a solution to the airport issue has become 
complicated. 
  When asked by reporters about the new airport in Hong Kong 
today, Lu Ping said that the issue of the new airport in Hong 
Kong can be said to be very simple, and what is needed is to 
follow the Memorandum of Understanding signed by China and 
Britain. When a reporter asked about Chris Patten's remarks 
that the Hong Kong Government is acting in accordance with the 
Memorandum of Understanding, Lu Ping said that with the present 
financial arrangements made by the British side, the debt 
involved greatly exceeds the amount mentioned in the Memorandum 
of Understanding. How could he say that the Memorandum of 
Understanding is being followed? Since the debt has exceeded 
the memorandum, it is necessary for the two sides to negotiate 
to solve the problem. 
  When asked about the issue of land allocations along the 
airport railroad, Lu Ping said that the British side had 
proposed allocating 58 hectares of land along the airport 
railroad all at once. The Chinese side holds that since it is 
necessary to build an airport railroad, land along the railroad 
should be developed. Whether or not the land should be 
allocated in one go should be determined by the land supply and 
demand situation each year. Such allocations should be 
cordinated with those of the Land Commission [Sino- British Land 
Commission], the purpose being not to cause confusion in the 
whole land market. 
  When a reporter mentioned that the Hong Kong Government had 
separated the airport project, Lu Ping held that the costs of 
the new airport should be settled by an overall financial plan. 
The present piecemeal approach is bound to increase costs. He 
said that according to figures on the financial reserve 
published by the British Hong Kong Government, the British Hong 
Kong Government surely has the strength to build the new airport 
in accordance with the memorandum. Lu Ping said that the 
Memorandum of Understanding stipulates that, in the future, 
HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] should be reserved for the 
government of the special administrative region and debt should 
not exceed HK$5 billion. The financial secretary of the British 
Hong Kong Government has said that, in the future, HK$78 billion 
will be kept for the government of the special administrative 
region. We said that HK$25 billion would be enough. The rest 
can be used for injecting funds so that debt will not exceed 
HK$5 billion. In this way, the airport can be built.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong 
affairs, Lu Ping, yesterday blasted what he described as a 
unilateral move by the Hong Kong Government to seek extra funds 
for airport projects without waiting for a Sino-British 
financial accord. 
  He also warned that the re-opening of airport negotiations 
could be affected by the refusal of the Secretary for Economic 
Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, to attend a meeting of the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) on the Airport Corporation 
Bill. 
  Speaking in Beijing yesterday, Mr Lu, the Director of the 
Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
voiced his opposition to granting extra funds to the new airport 
plan. 
  Mr Lu said China could not agree to the funding request, put 
to the Legislative Council on Monday [10 January]. 
  He denounced the Government for refusing to make a 
commitment 
on financing the airport projects. 
  "To follow the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) the 
Government's level of debt has to be limited to $5 billion," he 
said. 
  "There is a surplus of over $100 billion, it can inject a 
certain amount to the new airport construction." 
  Mr Lu also questioned the Government's claim that it could 
leave $78 billion in reserves to the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) government while virtually refusing to make a 
commitment. 
  In response, a government spokesman said: "We haven't seen 
the precise report of Mr Lu's comment but we are puzzled to hear 
suggestions that we are taking a unilateral action and that they 
were not informed." 
  He said papers on the funding options had been given to the 
Chinese side of the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee last 
week. 
  "What we have done is in line with the MOU. We are trying to 
maintain the momentum of the airport and to complete the 
projects to the maximum extent possible by mid-1997," he said. 
The spokesman said if the Chinese side had new proposals which 
helped reach an agreement, the Government would be happy to hear 
them. 
  In a paper circulated to Legco members on Monday, the 
Government proposed two options for taking the airport projects 
forward. One envisaged a request for a one-off grant of $377 
million for the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to allow it 
to finish works currently underway. The other suggested that on 
top of the airport body's running cost for the next financial 
year, funds totalling $1.3 billion should be made available to 
pay for three urgent construction projects. 
  Mr Lu said: "(The Government) hasn't discussed with us its 
decision to seek temporary funding from Legco. To this 
unilateral move we can never give our consent." 
  Under the Sino-British airport accord, which was signed in 
September 1991, China endorsed the airport proposal provided 
that Britain agreed to leave $25 billion in reserves for the 
post 1997 government, as well as to keep the level of government 
debt below $5 billion. 
  On the disposal of land along the airport railway, Mr Lu 
rejected the British suggestion that the 58 hectares should be 
granted in one go. 
  "If the land supply increases suddenly by about 60 hectares, 
how can one say that this will have no impact on the overall 
land supply [in the market]?" Mr Lu said there was no way that 
China would give its consent even though the British Hong Kong 
authorities had agreed to make concessions on the financial 
arrangements. 
  Referring to the Airport Corporation Bill, Mr Lu said the 
Chinese authorities could not share the Government's view that 
there would be adequate scrutiny of the future airport 
management body. 
  Despite the fact that the bill outlined that the Government 
was empowered to act on public interest, Mr Lu said: "When you 
realise that there are public interests concerned, you probably 
have to pay compensation (to the other signatories of 
agreements). 
  "Therefore, we asked the Government to come and explain to 
the PWC, given it said it would have adequate power to control 
the corporation. The PWC members are advisers to us." 
  Mr Lu said the PWC had decided to invite Mr Siu to explain 
the bill, seizing the opportunity of his scheduled visit to 
Beijing to sign an agreement with the civil aviation authority. 
  "If things carry on like this, it remains doubtful as to 
when 
the airport negotiation will resume," he said. 
  In Hong Kong, 14 Hong Kong affairs advisers yesterday told 
local XINHUA (New China News Agency) officials that China and 
Britain should try to strike a deal on the airport projects as 
soon as possible.

<F P=106> [By Michael Smith and political editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] Friction between Britain and China over the crucial 
question of funding for the Chek Lap Kok airport has come to a 
head, with Governor Chris Patten urging Beijing to stop "playing 
politics" with the project's future. Negotiations over airport 
funding-- already deadlocked--have been hindered further by 
deteriorating Sino-British relations on constitutional reform. 
  Legislators will this morning debate whether to approve a 
further injection of funds into the airport project to allow key 
contracts to continue in line with the 1997 completion date. 
But Beijing this week reacted angrily, lambasting the Hong Kong 
government for taking "unilateral action" in defiance of 
previous agreements. 
  Patten yesterday sharply rejected the allegation, saying 
that 
China was fully aware the project was now at the crossroads. 
"Everyone in Hong Kong, except conceivably the director of the 
NCNA (New China News Agency), knows that we could actually solve 
the problem of the airport like that if there was the will," he 
said. "I hope that will can be created in the coming weeks and 
months because if it is not it will be the SAR [Special 
Administrative Region] government, and the people of Hong Kong, 
and the people of southern China who will suffer most. 
  "So let's talk in the airport committee and stop making 
political points, we are not going to do that and I hope no 
Chinese officials will." 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod and Secretary of the 
Treasury Donald Tsang also implied the dilemma now facing the 
government had been brought about by Beijing's intransigence. 
"We informed the Chinese side through the JLG (Sino-British 
Joint Liaison Group) on 15 December that, in order to minimise 
delay and extra costs, we would be approaching the Legislative 
Council to discuss additional funding that would enable further 
urgent steps on the airport to be taken while discussions 
between the two sides continued," Macleod said. 
  "We explained that the options we were putting forward were 
designed to save money and reduce the risk of increased costs. 
  "Surely, it would be much better if the Chinese side would 
make their specific proposals on the financing clear."

<F P=106> [Report by Fanny Wong and Doreen Cheung] </F>
  [Text] Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday 
urged China to engage in early direct meetings to resolve the 
Chek Lap Kok airport issue instead of negotiating through press 
statements. 
  The director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, this week criticised the 
Government for seeking extra funding from the Legislative 
Council for the airport project. He accused officials of 
sitting on huge reserves and refusing to inject more capital to 
fund the infrastructure development. He also rejected the plan 
to develop land along the airport railway and raised queries 
about the Airport Corporation Bill unveiled for consultation. 
  Sir Hamish said Britain had tried many times to arrange 
expert meetings on such issues. He pointed out that Britain had 
informed China's JLG [Joint Liaison Group] team on December 15 
that the Government would approach Legco [Legislative Council] 
for more airport money and had invited their comments. Then had 
been no reply. 
  On January 5 the Government gave China an advance copy of 
the 
funding plans which were later published, again without 
response. The draft Airport Corporation Bill was also sent to 
the Chinese side on July 21 for comment. "We received no formal 
response till the end of November when the Chinese side 
confirmed that they would have no objection to publication of a 
White Bill," Sir Hamish said, adding there was no comment on the 
bill's contents. 
  The vice-director of the local XINHUA (the New China News 
Agency), Zhang Junsheng, said the piecemeal approach in seeking 
funds could not help resolve the problem. "They submit one 
report today and another report tomorrow. We want to solve the 
entire financial arrangements (for the airport and the rail 
link). They can't put forward requests like that," he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Hong Kong Branch 
of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY invited Hong Kong affairs advisers to 
a forum over the last few days. Advisers from various circles 
expressed views on Hong Kong's current political and economic 
situation and future development. They pointed out that 
accelerating various preparatory work for the latter part of the 
transition period is a task which brooks no delay. 
  During the forum, advisers believed that China's sustained 
deepening reform and vigorous economic development are a 
reliable basis for Hong Kong to maintain prosperity and 
stability. How to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity 
and how to effect a smooth hand-over of political power present 
the most important tasks facing the people of Hong Kong. In 
this connection, they offered many suggestions which may be used 
for reference; under the circumstances of there being no 
"through train [zhi tong che 4160 6639 6508]," they placed great 
hopes on the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory 
Committee of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Regional Government, which enjoys popular trust and represents 
many circles. 
  During the forum, Hong Kong Branch Deputy Director Zhang 
Junsheng stated: The Chinese Government absolutely will not 
refuse to abide by the principles which are already in existence 
due to the breakdown of Sino-British talks. In the future, it 
will still strictly implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
and handle the Hong Kong issue according to the provisions of 
the Basic Law and the agreements reached between China and 
Britain. 
  Nearly 40 advisers separately participated in discussion 
meetings on the special topics of politics and economy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Major Shock Is Likely To Be Caused in the </F>
Reorganization of the Three-Tiered Assemblies"] 
  [Text] The three-tiered administrative structure of the 
British Hong Kong Government must be disbanded in 1997 together 
with the end of British rule and administration in Hong Kong. 
This is the inevitable consequence of the British side's act in 
undermining the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 
electoral arrangements. In a recent statement, the spokesman 
for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office made 
this point plain so that Hong Kong people could clearly see the 
development of events and would make joint efforts with the 
Chinese side to reorganize the three-tiered assemblies in 1997 
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. 
This will be conducive to the smooth transition of Hong Kong. 
  Hong Kong people generally hope for Sino-British cooperation 
to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and to effect 
the smooth transfer of government in 1997. When Chris Patten 
dished out his "three violation" constitutional reform package, 
many social organizations and activists opposed it and urged him 
to return to the path of "three conformities" to restore 
cooperation with the Chinese side. When the Sino-British talks 
on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements began, Hong Kong 
people generally hoped that China and Britain would reach an 
agreement so that the political structure before and after 1997 
would converge. However, although the Chinese side made great 
efforts to strive for the conclusion of an agreement and made a 
series of compromises, the British side continued to 
deliberately impede the talks from proceeding in line with the 
"three conformity" principle. Finally, Patten brought part of 
his constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council and 
this led to the total termination of the Sino-British talks. 
  Facts during the past year and more repeatedly showed that 
the British side had no intention of following Hong Kong 
people's wishes nor of keeping its own promise and settling 
problems through talks in accordance with the "three conformity" 
principle. Hong Kong people's hopes have completely fallen 
through and the Chinese side's efforts were also in vain. Hong 
Kong people cannot but discard their illusions of the British 
side and join the Chinese in doing intensive preparatory work in 
all fields for recovering Hong Kong. 
  The British refuse to cooperate but the sky will not fall 
down. In 1997, the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies 
may cause certain shocks but Hong Kong people do not need to 
worry about this. President Jiang Zemin recently reiterated in 
his new year message to Hong Kong compatriots that "no matter 
what happens, we shall be of one heart and one mind with Hong 
Kong patriotic compatriots in all circles and the principle of 
'one country, two systems' will remain unchanged, the principle 
of maintaining the Basic Law will remain unchanged, and our 
determination to resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong 
will remain unchanged. Hong Kong will certainly be able to 
maintain long-term prosperity and stability and we have 
sufficient ability to do this and have full confidence in this." 
Obviously, the reorgnaization of the three-tiered assemblies in 
1997 will certainly be made strictly according to the principles 
specified by the Basic Law. Therefore, the reorganized 
three-tiered assemblies will give expression to the principles 
of the Basic Law and will guarantee the balanced participation 
of all social strata in local administrative affairs. This 
prospect should be clear. 
  At the same time, the Chinese side will also listen 
extensively to Hong Kong people's opinions on the way to 
reorganize the three- tiered assemblies. It is believed that 
after the three-tiered political structure of the British Hong 
Kong authorities is disbanded, members of the three-tiered 
assemblies elected in 1994 or 1995 may still be able to reenter 
the assemblies as long as they satisfy the requirements 
specified by the Basic Law, love China and love Hong Kong, and 
are willing to continue to serve the local community. In short, 
as long as the vast number of Hong Kong residents actively 
support the work of the Preliminary Work Committee and make 
joint efforts with the Chinese Government, the shock caused by 
the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies will be 
reduced to a minimum and Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity will certainly be maintained. Hong Kong compatriots 
should completely set their minds at rest on this point. 
  The colonial government will come to an end on 30 June 1997. 
Hong Kong people completely support China's recovery of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the implementation of the "one 
country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong. They will be masters 
of Hong Kong and Hong Kong will continue to be their home after 
1997. Therefore, they know that the British who will return 
home after the Union Flag is lowered may not take a responsible 
attitude toward Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997. 
Only the Chinese Government shares the same interests with Hong 
Kong people and really cares about post-1997 prosperity and 
stability and will inevitably assume a responsible attitude in 
adopting the transitional measures. Therefore, the sooner 
preparations are made to get rid of Patten's disruptive role by 
working out the method of forming the first three-tiered 
assembly structure of the special adminsitrative region, the 
more favorable things will be for a smooth transition. 
  As long as the reorganization of the three-tiered assemblies 
constantly follows the principle of orderly and gradual 
progress, respects history, and gives consideration to the 
current reality, then the work can be done in line with the 
principles specified by the Basic Law and can be suited to the 
actual needs in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity. 
  Moreover, the fact of China's vigorous economic development 
is greatly conducive to Hong Kong's post-1997 stable 
development. Hong Kong and the mainland are closely 
interdependent. The Chinese Government will certainly try by 
every possible means to keep Hong Kong's existing social system 
unchanged, to ensure the stable and smoth development of 
democratic politics, and to continuously raise the living 
standards of the local residents. This will be favorable to 
China's four modernizations and will also be conducive to the 
practice of "one country, two systems." 
  The Chinese Government will also give consideration to the 
performances of foreign companies and Hong Kong enterprises 
which have made contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stabiity in the transitional period and will offer them more 
favorable conditions to seek future development in the mainland 
market. Cooperation will benefit both sides. Those who follow 
Patten in disrupting the order in Hong Kong will have no future. 
Those who cooperate with China and help keep Hong Kong's 
stability will have very bright futures. All foreign and local 
businessmen not support the reform package which just creates 
confrontation and trouble. Therefore, Patten will have less and 
less influence as he finds scant support for his unjust cause. 
On the other hand, China will enjoy abundant support for its 
just cause of striving for Hong Kong's smooth transition. China 
will also be able to achieve the goal of preventing any shocks 
appearing in Hong Kong in 1997.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] expressed regret late Wednesday [12 January] over France's 
decision to stop arms dealings with Taiwan. 
  "It is regretful that France decided to discontinue arms 
sales to Taiwan under Beijing's pressure," the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs said in a press statement. 
  Paris and Beijing issued a joint communique Wednesday in 
which France promised that the 60 Mirage fighter planes it 
agreed to sell to Taiwan in late 1992 will be its last arms deal 
with the ROC. In return, Beijing would end its year-long ban on 
giving lucrative contracts to French companies. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman blasted Beijing for repeatedly 
interfering in Taiwan's defensive arms purchases. "It is 
unthinkable that Beijing, while expanding its own military 
muscle and arms exports, has constantly demanded other countries 
not sell defensive weapons to Taiwan," he noted. 
  The spokesman stressed that the ROC's arms purchases are 
mainly for defending national security and maintaining peace in 
the Taiwan Strait. 
  "The joint communique between France and Mainland China will 
not contribute to the peace in the Asia-Pacific region," he 
observed. 
  The French Government announced the sale of 60 Mirage 
fighters to Taiwan shortly after former U.S. President George 
Bush agreed to sell 150 F-16s to the island in November 1992. 
  In 1991, Taiwan signed a contract with France to purchase 16 
Lafayette-class frigates as part of its plan to beef up its 
naval force. 
  Reports from Paris quoted French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe 
as saying Wednesday that France will honor its previous arms 
deals with Taiwan.

  [Text] The Vatican will establish formal diplomatic ties 
with the PRC but will maintain its current ties with Taiwan, a 
high- ranking Vatican official has said. The official's 
statement was reported on semi-official radio in Taiwan, but 
neither the official's name or rank was given. 
  A reporter asked the Reverend (Hsu Ying-fa), the secretary 
general of the Catholic Bishop's Office in the ROC [Republic of 
China], to comment on the report. (Hsu) said: The Vatican has 
plans to establish formal ties with the People's Republic, but 
the Vatican Parliament has also promised the Bishop's Office in 
Taiwan that it would not cut its ties with any country, 
including Taiwan. (Hsu's) office was not surprised when it heard 
of the news. (Hsu) said the ROC Government should not worry too 
much about the Vatican's decision. However, it was possible 
that the Vatican would assign an ambassador to Mainland China 
and a representative to Taiwan for future contact.

  [Text] Minister without Portfolio Chiu Hung-tao said 
Tuesday [11 January] it is up to Peking [Beijing] whether the 
Vatican will maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei after 
establishing such relations with mainland China. Chiu was 
responding to reports that the Vatican will establish formal 
diplomatic relations with the mainland, but will not sever 
existing relations with Taiwan. 
  Chiu claimed that the problem of dual recognition for the 
ROC 
and the PRC will have to be determined largely by Peking's 
attitude. He said that if the PRC approves of the scheme, there 
will be no reason why other countries should cut their 
diplomatic ties with the ROC. Some people are worried that this 
could encourage other countries with formal ties with Taiwan to 
recognize the mainland and down- grade their envoys here. Chiu 
said that perhaps more countries which previously did not 
recognize Taiwan would decide to follow the Vatican's example in 
setting up an official office here without breaking ties with 
the mainland.

  [Text] According to a report in Taipei's LIEN HO PAO, 
President Li Teng-hui has accepted an invitation extended by 
Indonesia to visit the country during the Spring Festival 
holiday. It will be the second unofficial visit by President Li 
in his capacity as a president to a state with which we have no 
diplomatic relations since he took office. It is predicted that 
President Li will meet with Indonesian President Suharto during 
his coming visit, thereby establishing a friendship between the 
paramount leaders of the Republic of China [ROC] and Indonesia. 
  Because Indonesia will host an annual meeting of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum at the end of 
this year and has already said that it will invite the leaders 
of all APEC members states to an informal summit, it is 
generally believed that President Li will broadly exchange views 
with the Indonesian side on the APEC meeting and on the ROC's 
policy toward the region located to the south of Taiwan. It has 
been learned that the advance men of the Foreign Ministry have 
already visited Indonesia to discuss protocol-related issues. 
Barring an unexpected change, President Li should be able to 
make his visit in early February. 
  However, as for whether the president will go abroad for a 
vacation during the Spring Festival, (Chang Ping-nan), deputy 
director of the First Bureau of the Presidential Office, 
emphasized in an interview with reporters yesterday [11 January] 
afternoon that he was not aware there existed such a plan as the 
one mentioned above.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) -- The government is 
promoting the "Southern Strategy" to cut Taiwan's investment 
risk in Mainland China, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang 
said Thursday [13 January]. 
  The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to invest more 
in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN), which groups Indonesia, Singapore, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Brunei. 
  Chiang made the remark in a nationwide radio program aired 
by 
the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) in the morning. 
  Although the new investment drive is a "win-win" policy for 
both Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries, the government will 
respect whatever decisions domestic investors make, he noted. 
  The minister, however, cited active participation in the new 
investment strategy as the best policy, saying traders should 
follow business benefits. 
  Under the "Southern Strategy," which is also touted as the 
"Guidelines for the Strengthening of Trade Ties With Southeast 
Asia," the government will take the initiative to deal with 
various governments to help promote the interests of Taiwan 
investors, he elaborated. 
  If Taiwan investors don't go to Southeast Asia now, their 
counterparts in other countries such as Japan, South Korea, and 
the United States will, he warned. 
  In the initial stage, he added, the strategy will target 
Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. 
  The three countries boast rich natural resources and an 
abundant labor force, he said, suggesting that Taiwan investors 
invest in agriculture, forestry, fishery, petrochemicals, and 
labor-intensive industries. 
  Moreover, he revealed, the government is also pondering 
cooperation with Indonesia on aerospace industry development. 
The aerospace development package is still in the planning 
stages, he added. 
  Chiang stressed that the "Southern Strategy" will produce 
reciprocal benefits, saying increased Taiwan investments will 
help boost the economies and upgrade the living standards in the 
Southeast Asian countries, whose peoples in turn will have more 
purchasing power to buy Taiwan-made products.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan's annual outbound 
investment substantially outpaced inbound investment for the 
first time in 1993, the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  Statistics released by the ministry's investment commission 
show that outward investment totaled U.S.$1.66 billion last 
year, up a whopping 87 percent from 1992, while approved foreign 
and overseas Chinese investment shrank 17 percent to U.S.$1.21 
billion, resulting in a U.S.$450 million investment deficit for 
Taiwan. 
  The United States remained the top destination for Taiwan 
investors, absorbing about U.S.$380 million last year, which is 
nearly twice that of 1992. 
  Singapore, however, was on top of the growth among all 
Taiwan 
capital recipients. Taiwan manufacturers invested about U.S.$70 
million in the Southeast Asia country last year, representing a 
6.9- fold jump from more than U.S.$8 million in 1992. [figures 
as received] 
  Vietnam also emerged as a top priority target of Taiwan 
businessmen, with investments leaping from U.S.$20 million in 
1992 to U.S.$150 million in 1993. 
  In term of industries, outbound investments in paper and 
paper products, which rose 917 percent for 1992 to U.S.$1.12 
billion last year, made the biggest growth. 
  Of the 19.3 inbound investments, investors from the 
Philippines led the list of overseas Chinese with U.S.$50 
million, followed by the United States and Hong Kong. 
  Japan was the largest foreign country with investments in 
Taiwan. In 1993 investments in Taiwan totaled U.S.$271 million, 
down 35 percent from 1992. 
  European investors ranked second with their investments 
growing 27 percent to U.S.$258 million last year.

"National Monetary Work Conference Opens in Beijing To Discuss 
Six-Point Reform Program"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (WEN WEI PO) -- A national monetary 
work conference began a six-day meeting in Beijing today, and a 
meeting of the presidents of the various major branches of the 
People's Bank of China will be held at the same time. State 
Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji will deliver a speech at the 
closing ceremony on 17 January. 
  An authoritative source disclosed that the principal 
missions 
of the current monetary work conference were to comprehensively 
and conscientiously carry out the requirements of monetary 
structural reform proposed at the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and to put monetary restructuring 
plans formulated by the central authorities into practice. The 
primary substance of the above plans include: 
  --The institution of a powerful macroscopic regulation and 
control system under the central bank. 
  --The formation of several policy banks and the change from 
specialized banks to commercial banks to realize the separation 
of policy-oriented banking from commercial banking; the 
establishment of a state development bank mainly engaged in 
state investment in key construction projects and the provision 
of loans; the establishment of a China Import and Export Credit 
Bank to foster imports and exports of machinery and electrical 
products, particularly complete equipment sets, and to extend 
credit to buyers and sellers; and the establishment of an 
agricultural development bank. 
  --The adoption of measures to optimize the structure of 
credit funds, enhance the fund utilization rate, and ensure that 
credit funds are used to support the state's key construction 
projects. 
  --A requirement for the central bank to intervene in the 
foreign exchange markets to maintain the general stability of 
exchange rates through market operations, and the establishment 
of a market for foreign exchange transactions among banks. 
  --The further development and revitalization of money 
markets 
to facilitate financing under the precondition of a strict and 
standardized management of the markets. 
  --The further amplification and perfection of monetary rules 
and regulations in order to tighten monetary examination, 
intensify risk management, and guarantee the security and 
liquidity of funds.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Dai Lan (2071 1526): "A Major Measure </F>
for Reforming Foreign Exchange System -- Commenting on 
Unification of China's Foreign Exchange Rates"] 
  [Text] Reform of China's foreign exchange system has made a 
giant leap after all. 
  On 29 December 1993, officials from the People's Bank of 
China announced: As of 1 January 1994, China will unify 
exchange rates and practice a unitary, well-managed, and 
floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand. 
This major measure taken by the Chinese Government for the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure is 
undoubtedly a relatively thorough change to the double-track 
system of exchange rates, under which official rates and rates 
quoted at foreign exchange swap markets coexisted, and which has 
been practiced in China for several dozen years. 
  In fact, the exchange rate of renminbi has undergone several 
changes since reform and opening up. Prior to 9 April 1991, an 
adjustable "pegged" exchange rate system was practiced in China 
for official exchange rates. Starting 9 April 1991, the 
official rates of renminbi were quoted under a managed floating 
rate system with the rates between U.S. dollar and reminbi at 
about 1:5.2 then floating to about 1:5.8 at the end of last 
year. At the beginning of 1988, China set up foreign exchange 
swap markets, allowing enterprises to buy or sell foreign 
exchange at the prices determined, to a certain extent, by 
market supply and demand. In December 1991, China again set up 
foreign exchange swap markets for residents inside the 
territory, allowing them to trade foreign exchange within a 
certain limit. Comparing the present reform with the above 
progressive changes, people can see that there are distinctive 
differences in terms of range and intensity. 
  The current reform of foreign exchange system also includes 
the practice of a banking system in settlement and sales of 
foreign exchange; revocation of foreign exchange to be retained 
and turned over to the state by enterprises; establishment of an 
exchange market for transactions among banks; improvement of 
exchange rate formation mechanisms; prohibition of foreign 
exchange priced, settled, and circulated inside the territory; 
suspension of issuing exchange coupons; improvement and 
perfection of managing settlement of internal and external 
remittances; realization of renminbi convertibility under 
current accounts; cancellation of mandatory planning for revenue 
and expenditure in foreign exchange; and exercise of macroscopic 
regulation and control by the state over foreign exchange and 
international payments mainly through economic and legal means. 
  This major reform measure will have a far-reaching impact on 
China's economy. Experts maintain that judging from the 
economic situation in China now, conditions for unified exchange 
rates have matured. According to the latest figures released by 
the State Statistical Bureau, China's GNP broke through 3 
trillion yuan last year, representing an increase of 13 percent 
over the previous year, and the total volume of imports and 
exports reached $190 billion, increasing by approximately 15 
percent over the previous year. Since Chinese commodities are 
acceptable to the world, it is natural that renminbi, which 
represents the value of Chinese commodities, should be accepted 
by the world too. This has provided favorable conditions for 
unification of the renminbi exchange rate from the point of 
balancing international payments. 
  People also discovered that at the time when the exchange 
rates were being unified, a "consumption craze" emerged in large 
and medium cities in China, but it was very soon quenched. This 
was attributed to the following arrangements of the government. 
Foreign exchange retained by enterprises was allowed to be used 
again, exchange coupons were allowed to be used indefinitely 
after the suspension of their issuance, the price difference 
between renminbi and exchange coupons was maintained, and 
others, to avoid encroaching upon the interests of enterprises, 
localities, and individuals. In the meantime, people realized 
more clearly that although the unification of exchange rates 
might still cause labor pangs, after all, advantages outweighed 
disadvantages. It will be conducive to China's openness to the 
outside world, importing of foreign capital, building of the 
socialist market economic structure, and enhancement of 
efficiency in all capital liquidity. It will also contribute to 
restoring China's signatory status in GATT as it has removed a 
major obstruction on the road to reentering GATT. In addition, 
the practice of a unified exchange rate system also has opened a 
path for renminbi to become a freely convertible currency, 
thereby moving toward achieving the ultimate goal of linking 
China's markets with the world market. 
  Economists here maintain that in the course of abolishing 
the 
old structure and establishing the new, there are still a lot of 
concrete tasks to do. China's new exchange rate system has just 
begun to operate, so the government should be very prudent in 
its actions and chiefly employ economic and legal means to 
achieve macroscopic regulation and control over foreign exchange 
and international payments, with a view to preventing great 
fluctuations in exchange rates and ensuring China's economy 
develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China 
[BOC], the state foreign exchange bank, reported here today its 
increased foreign exchange deposits and assets volume and said 
that its credit policy in the new year would stress economic 
efficiency while avoiding credit risks. 
  The bank revealed that its foreign exchange deposits hit 
27.84 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1993, of which 9.2 
billion U.S. dollars were individual savings. 
  This represents an increase of 18 percent and 50.7 percent 
respectively, compared with the previous year. 
  BOC's overseas branches also did brisk business in 1993, 
with 
the deposits in these branches expanded to some 59.9 billion 
U.S. dollars and the total assets value risen to over 120.7 
billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year. 
  However, "we should stress economic efficiency, and the 
ability of repayment should be the important yardstick in 
extending loans," said Wang Qiren, the bank's new president, 
when addressing a working meeting attended by BOC's branch heads 
across the country today. 
  According to Wang, the bank's credit priorities in 1994 
would 
still be given to some enterprises which have been the country's 
big hard currency earners, some efficient state enterprises, the 
basic industries and infrastructure construction projects. 
  The bank would try to ensure the credit supply of 
foreign-funded enterprises, said Wang. 
  Lending to enterprises with poor productivity or out-dated 
techniques, as well as money-losing firms would be strictly 
controlled, as such loans would assume more risks. 
  The president asked the branch officials not to provide a 
penny to new capital projects which have not been licensed by 
the central authorities. 
  Starting this year, China introduced a new foreign exchange 
rate system characterized by a single and floating exchange rate 
for the Chinese yuan. 
  Under the system, enterprises and units must sell all their 
foreign exchange earnings to the state banks and buy hard 
currency from the banks with necessary documents. 
  To ensure necessary and sufficient supply of foreign 
exchange, the Bank of China will set up special sections to 
examine the validity of the documents. 
  It will also set up a unified foreign exchange rate with 
certain floating range on the basis of the benchmark rate set by 
the central bank to guide the foreign exchange business in its 
branch offices across the country. 
  Wang Qiren revealed that this year, the bank will provide 
services to individual Chinese who are doing foreign exchange 
trading. 
  However, the service would first open in 
economically-developed coastal regions and with prudence, said 
Wang. 
  He urged BOC branch offices to mobilize enough RMB 
[renminbi] 
yuan to ensure the converting of foreign exchange certificates 
(FEC) and the settlement of hard currencies.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--China 
experienced a fairly sharp price fluctuation around the New 
Year. Does this increase in prices for grain, oil, foods and 
home electric appliances, coming as it did on the eve of the 
initiation of this year's reforms, signal, that this year, or in 
the future, it is not going to be peaceful or that reforms has 
been too swift and drastic? 
  A commentary by a correspondent in ZHONGGUO GAIGE BAO [CHINA 
REFORM POST], which put out its inaugural issue only today, 
entitled "Prices go up and down, reforms continue to forge 
ahead," held that the recent round of price hikes, especially 
prices for grains, oil, and home appliances, which topped the 
hikes, were not caused by a shortage of goods or demand 
exceeding supply or a problem that might affect the overall 
situation, and therefore was not a new round of inflation. 
  The commentary says: Rising and falling prices affect 
thousands of households and everyone has his opinion. But it 
would be a little too much to view the recent round of price 
hike as a prelude to the kind of buying panic witnessed in 1988. 
  From the overall economic situation perspective, the buying 
panic five years ago was triggered by a serious unbalance 
between total supply and total demand. This was not the case in 
the latest price hike, which was rather a man-made local 
fluctuation. 
  Last year, China's economy grew at a high-speed rate of 13 
percent, with its GNP topping 3,000 billion yuan, winning praise 
around the world. Macro-regulation and control last summer and 
autumn removed some unhealthy elements, or lessened their harm, 
in our economic life. Annual total national economic supply of 
goods, including some capital goods which had been undersupplied 
in the first half of last year, were bigger than total demand--a 
sharp contrast to 1988. Last year, China's gross grain output 
hit a record high at 456 million tonnes. The state had full 
grain reserves, and demand equaled supply. After 15 years of 
construction, China's production capacity of major home electric 
appliances far outruns their demand. The worries of the 
manufacturers who make color televisions, refrigerators, washing 
machines, hi-fi machines, and air conditioners are sluggish 
sales and inventory backlogs, resulting in underproduction and 
idle equipment, rather than big demand or panic buying. This 
explains why prices for home electric appliances fell last 
autumn, causing worry among manufacturers and dealers, until the 
market improved toward the end of the year, prices recovered, 
and times became better for them. 
  The commentary pointed out: The yearend price hikes on the 
mainland were touched off by many different factors: 
  Grain price increases began sharply in the south and moved 
northward moderately. This was reflected in: Peasants' 
reluctance to sell grain in their they had, purchases by 
individual grain dealers at high prices, and state-owned grain 
stores held off selling grain in anticipation of higher prices. 
Sensing the trend, some residents joined the ranks of the 
buyers. With last year's bumper harvests, was it not strange 
that peasants were unwilling to sell their grains? No, it was 
not strange. Following the national rural work conference last 
October, there came the news that the state was going to raise 
the grain procurement price by a relatively great margin. The 
peasants heard the news--and which one of them did not want to 
wait for a better sale price? Some peasants turned themselves 
around to head home when they learned the news on their way to 
sell their grains. 
  Prices for home electric appliances reversed the falls and 
rose because of the misunderstanding of the consumption tax. As 
soon as word came out that there would be tax changes and that 
the state was going to levy consumption taxes beginning with the 
new year, the abrupt price rise in 1988, of color televisions 
came to mind. Who does not want to insure against inflation if 
he has money? Many only realized the consumption tax did not 
affect the price until after they had already bought home 
electric appliances. 
  But this applies not only to home electric appliances. Even 
the sharp fall of stocks was ultimately caused by noneconomic 
factors. It was mainly caused by stories about the state 
planning to tax individual income earned from stocks and the 
securities commission's severe restrictions on allocating and 
giving shares, which increased the number of sellers and drove 
off buyers. Eventually this led to a 200 point fall on the 
Shanghai stock market. Later people recovered their senses, the 
shares index climbed back, and the market returned to normal. 
  The commentary says, inflation may be demand-pulled or 
cost-pushed. The latest round of price hikes was neither the 
former nor latter, but was caused by insufficient advanced 
publicity explaining the forthcoming reformist measures, and as 
it was, strictly speaking, not inflation. Although for now 
prices remain high and the threat of inflation still exists, 
this is not the same as inflation. 
  Lastly, the correspondent's commentary observed: The latest 
round of "price hike turmoil" has taught us that in the future, 
adjustment actions by the state on economic life inevitably 
cause widespread social concern and reactions. This is not 
strange, because reforms, in the end, are adjustments of 
interest relationships. It would indeed be strange for people 
not to react to something which concerns their immediate 
interests. For concerned government departments, since the 
structure is breaking new ground, the whole structure is moving 
ahead with breakthroughs in selected areas, and since the 
planned economy is moving rapidly toward a market economy, they 
have to review and look anew at some of the past methods, 
customary and well-tried though they are. They must pursue 
scientific, effective macroregulation and control, prevent 
excessive price rises, gradually learn to handle the market 
economy with a genuine market approach, and try as much as 
possible to avoid handling the market economy with a planning 
economy approach.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Council's 
Information Office gave a media briefing in Beijing today, 
during which Jin Xin, director general of the State 
Administration of Taxation, briefed Chinese and foreign 
reporters about China's tax reform and fielded related questions. 
  According to the director general, on 1 January this year a 
major structural reform became effective in China's industrial 
and commercial taxes; and a new system was implemented for the 
main tax categories, including value-added tax, consumption tax, 
business tax, enterprise income tax, individual income tax, 
resource tax, and land value-added tax. Judging from the 
progress in implementing the new system over the past 10 or more 
days, the transition from the old to the new taxation system has 
been rather smooth. 
  Jin Xin particularly discussed tax reform issues concerning 
enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises. He 
said: The implementation of the new taxation system will not 
change the provisions on tax incentives in the income tax law 
for foreign-invested and foreign enterprises which went into 
effect on 1 July 1991. Changes for foreign-invested and foreign 
enterprises involve mainly tax categories such as the nationally 
unified value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax which 
are to be levied on foreign-invested enterprises and foreign 
enterprises effective 1 January 1994 in accordance with a 
decision adopted by the fifth meeting of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee. 
  Jin Xin pointed out: The levying of the nationally unified 
value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax on 
enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises is 
to satisfy the requirements of establishing and developing a 
socialist market economy and to equalize the tax burden; it has 
also been the request of the majority of foreign-invested 
enterprises and foreign enterprises. To keep foreign tax policy 
successive and stable, the tax reform has followed an important 
policy principle of not increasing the tax burden on enterprises 
with foreign investment. This is to say that the redesigning of 
tax rates will neither increase nor decrease the aggregate tax 
burden. In this way, the state can be guaranteed of no decrease 
in its financial revenue, and enterprises, of no additional tax 
burden as a result of reform. 
  Jin Xin said: Due to changes in the structure of the 
taxation system and in the chain of tax payers, increased or 
decreased tax burdens on products and enterprises will be 
unavoidable. As far as this is concerned, the state will adopt 
necessary policy measures to ensure the smooth transition from 
the old to the new tax system. He added: In line with the 
regulations adopted by the NPC Standing Committee, enterprises 
with foreign investment licensed before 31 December 1993 will be 
refunded any tax burden increase resulting from the introduction 
of the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax as 
approved by the tax authorities. This will be limited within 
the time period of the approved contract of operation, with a 
maximum period of five years. Any foreign-invested enterprises 
approved after 1 January 1994 will be subject to the new tax 
system.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Jin Xin, director- 
general of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT), 
emphasized here today that the new taxation system, which went 
into effect at the beginning of this year, will not damage the 
interests of overseas-funded enterprises. 
  According to him, the tax reform will not change the income 
tax law concerning foreign investment enterprises effective as 
of July 1991, with all the incentives maintained. 
  Foreign investment enterprises set up in special economic 
zones, coastal opening-up districts and the Pudong new area in 
Shanghai, will still enjoy an unchanged 15 percent preferential 
income tax rate, Jin Xin said. He added that for domestic 
enterprises, a single flat rate of 33 percent is being 
implemented. 
  However, as he disclosed, the nationally unified value added 
tax, excise tax and business tax will be levied on enterprises 
with foreign investment and foreign enterprises as of January 1, 
1994, as was decided at the 5th Session of the Standing 
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). 
  He said this was to satisfy the requirements of a socialist 
market economy, to equalize tax burden, as has also been the 
request of the enterprises with foreign investment and foreign 
enterprises. 
  Jin vowed that to keep the foreign tax policy successive and 
stable, the tax reform has followed an important policy 
principle for foreign investment enterprises, namely, the 
redesigning of tax rates would neither increase nor decrease the 
aggregate tax burden. 
  To favor the smooth transition from the old to the new 
taxation system, the NPC Standing Committee has approved that 
for foreign- funded enterprises licensed before December 31, 
1993, any tax burden increase resulting from the tax reform is 
to be refunded to the enterprises as approved by the tax 
authorities. 
  According to him, this preferential treatment will be 
limited 
within the time period of the contract, with a maximum period of 
five years. But, any foreign-invested enterprises approved 
after January 1, 1994, will be subject to the new tax regime. 
  Jin Xin concluded that the measure will allow foreign 
enterprises a five-year period to transmit management mechanisms 
and raise economic benefits, in order to exercise fair 
competition with domestic enterprises after five years. 
  He emphasized that this measure has once again demonstrated 
China's determination to open up to the outside world at an 
accelerating pace.

  [Text] Beijing 7 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Based on its 
monitoring of the Chinese economy in 1993, an authoritative 
department in charge of economic affairs predicts that in the 
first few months of 1994, China's economy will rebound rapidly, 
therefore, it is necessary to implement a slightly tighter 
monetary policy to avoid more stringent policies, which will be 
needed if the economy becomes "overheated" once again. 
  At present, there are many destabilizing factors within 
China's economy; in particular, the investment momentum is 
great, and many localities are waiting for the central 
leadership to delegate more power to them so they can launch 
projects. Meanwhile, the reason for poor economic efficiency 
among enterprises is partly because of a shortage of funds due 
to a cut in the total, but mainly because they have internal 
structural problems. If the current monetary policy, which is 
already loose, continues to become loose, then the whole economy 
will rebound rapidly and will quickly reach the level of July 
1993, leading to a tense macroeconomic situation. 
  The year 1994 will be a year of reforms in China. Reforms in 
the areas of taxation, finance, investment, foreign exchange, 
housing, and prices will be thoroughly launched, and these 
reforms are unprecedented in terms of pace, the number of 
measures, and the areas to be solved when compared with those of 
the past 10 years or so. In the new round of reforms, 
destabilizing factors will also arise, therefore, the duty for 
macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 will be very 
arduous. 
  The authoritative department pointed out that macroeconomic 
regulation and control in 1994 should pay special attention to 
maintaining price stability and a moderate growth rate. 
  Price increases are a very important factor affecting social 
stability. At present, the price level is already high, 
especially in the domain of residents' daily necessities. In 
the fourth quarter of last year, a loose monetary policy was 
implemented, and this led to greater inflationary pressure. 
Recently, some people have started panic buying of grain, gold 
ornaments, and household electric appliances, and this shows 
that people have already become very sensitive to prices. In 
1994, after implementing reform of the revenue system and reform 
of wages in government, party, and business units, a close watch 
must be kept on the price trend, and the people's sensitivity 
and fears relating to prices should not be ignored. Other 
reforms must consider prudent timing to avoid creating an 
unfavorable impact on markets and residents. 
  The smooth process of reform needs moderate growth. What is 
moderate? No more than 10 percent is moderate. In the area of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the policy of control over 
a more appropriate total quantity should be upheld, and the good 
economic situation should never justify a "great leap forward" 
in the economy. 
  To conclude, in 1994, regulation and control over total 
quantity should continue to use the method of routine, timely, 
and moderate "slight adjustments" to remove destabilizing 
factors promptly.

Economic `Fluctuations' Analyzed" in the 9 December 1993 China 
DAILY REPORT pp 25-35] 
  [Text] 5. 1992-1993: Facing a New Round of 
Fluctuations 
  Since the beginning of 1992, China's economic reform and 
development has jumped to a "new level." However, at the same 
time, the economy has also swiftly started to move toward 
overheating. Our aim in looking back at and analyzing past 
fluctuations is to be better able to understand China's economic 
structure at present by comparing it with that of the past. We 
want to see which aspects have seen change and which aspects 
have not yet seen change, so that we can, in a targeted way, 
adopt effective policies for macroeconomic stability. 
  5.1--"Already changed" and "not changed" 
  First, we should recognize that as compared to 1987-88, our 
country's economic structure has seen many positive changes: 1) 
There has been further development of the non-state-owned 
economy, and such entities now account for over 50 percent of 
gross industrial output value and GNP. These are economic 
entities which are oriented toward the market and have strong 
self-restraint. They thus play a positive role in stabilizing 
the economy. 2) There has been a further expansion of opening 
up to the outside, there has been a great increase in investment 
of foreign funds, imports and exports have been further expanded 
and price increases have, in many areas (such as steel products 
and other production materials) already been subject to the 
restraints of international market prices. 3) All sorts of 
markets have seen further development. While in some markets, 
such as the share market, the real estate market,and the 
securities market, there has been some chaos (especially because 
of the "speculation using public funds" engaged in in some 
markets by state-owned and semi-state-owned companies), in the 
end, however, these still provide more investment avenues and 
play a role in holding down the expansion of consumer demand and 
in encouraging the accumulation of capital. All of these aspects 
have played a stabilizing role in regard to macroeconomic 
movement. 
  However, solely on this basis or on the basis of the 
phenomenon of "market weakness" which appeared during the two 
previous years of tightening up, holding that China's economic 
structure has undergone a "basic change," and that there has 
been a change from "resource constraint" to "demand constraint" 
(see Guo Shu-qing, 1992) is a bit premature. 
  China's economic structure has not yet seen basic changes in 
the following two major areas: 
  1. The basic structure of the state-owned economic sector 
has not yet seen change, and the soft budgetary restraints of 
the local governments and state-owned enterprises and the 
various operational modes based on these (including the response 
modes to the many economic "policy variables") have not yet seen 
basic change. 
  2. The leading position of the state-owned economy has still 
not changed. This can be explained through the following two 
aspects: 1) While the state-owned economy no longer constitutes 
the majority in terms of output value or national income, the 
state-owned economy still occupies the dominant position in 
terms of expenditure and total demand. Here the key question 
is: When the bank savings from the various economic sectors are 
transferred into credit, they mainly flow through the state 
banking system to state-owned economic sectors (at present, it 
is estimated that this is the case for more than 80 percent of 
the total), while the credit issued to town and township 
enterprises only constitutes a very small part. In this way, 
the operational sectors, which only constitute a small part of 
the income structure, through the savings-credit link, come to 
constitute a large part in the expenditure structure, and 
particularly investment expenditure. Seen from the situation of 
enterprise direct financing, the state-owned enterprises have 
quite weak restraints, and quite great "nerve," and the funds 
they draw in are naturally quite great. 2) The state-owned 
economy is mainly centered in national economic lifeblood 
sectors such as light and heavy industry, energy, and mining. 
Thus, the guiding role that it plays in the national economy 
has not changed. 3) Based on the above two points, that which 
determines the changes in economic fluctuations in our country 
at present is still the various state-owned economic sectors. 
Town and township enterprises and the private economy have seen 
quite high growth rates since 1990. However, as they are mainly 
centered in consumer product processing industries, commerce, 
and service industries, they only play a role in maintaining the 
supply of consumer products, and they cannot spur the revival of 
the overall economy. Only when the state-owned economy 
"revives" will the overall economy be gradually enlivened. A 
prominent point in this is that not only does investment by 
state-owned sectors still constitutes a large part (over 60 
percent) of overall social investment, but the expansion of 
investment by the state-owned economy (whole-people ownership 
investment) still plays, as it did in the various previous 
economic fluctuations, a leading role and a decisive role in 
overall economic recovery. 4) In financial income, the profits 
and taxes which derive from state-owned enterprises still 
constitute the major part. As the financial balance situation 
plays an extremely important role in the formulation of 
macroeconomic policies, the operational situation of state-owned 
economic sectors still plays a decisive role in overall 
macroeconomic changes. For example, sectors will not dare or 
are not willing to adopt various policies to restrain the 
expansion of credit or growth of demand (such as by raising 
credit interest rates), just so that they can ensure that the 
profits and taxes handed up by state-owned enterprises do not 
decline or their losses do not further expand. 
  5.2--A new round of handing down power and financial 
chaos 
  Under the precondition of the "no changes" noted above, 
since 
the beginning of 1992, following the further expansion of the 
autonomy of localities and enterprises, and the intensification 
of decentralized "competition under soft constraints," elements 
of economic instability have seen a further increase rather than 
a reduction. Of these elements, the two "autonomies" noted 
below have been particularly important in macroeconomic 
instability and accelerating the pace of economic overheating: 
  1. Autonomy in terms of examining and approving investment 
projects has been completely handed down. This has led to a 
very great increase in investment by localities themselves (for 
example, some data show that 82.7 percent of newly commenced 
projects involving whole-people ownership investment over the 
period January to May 1992 were local projects). Also, there 
has been a great increase in fixed-asset investment. Over the 
period January to May 1993, there was a growth of 70.7 percent 
over the same period of the previous year in state-owned 
fixed-asset investment. This is a "high speed" rarely seen 
previously. 
  2. "Autonomy in terms of direct financing." This is a very 
important autonomy which has been obtained by local governments 
and enterprises, as it enables them to avoid central government 
measures to control (directly or indirectly) credit and money. 
They raise funds directly in society by paying interest rates 
much higher than bank savings deposit interest rates. This 
results in government money policies losing their effectiveness. 
In 1992, the total value of various types of negotiable 
securities on China's securities market was 128 billion yuan. 
Of these, state bonds were valued at 41 billion yuan, the 
investment bonds of the various state investment companies under 
the State Planning Commission totaled 12.7 billion yuan, 
enterprise bonds totaled 37.9 billion yuan, financial bonds 
totaled 25.5 billion yuan and shares totaled 10.9 billion yuan. 
The above-mentioned securities are all quite regular and the 
amounts issued can be ascertained through statistics. If we add 
to these the shares issued within enterprises, the raising of 
funds outside the plans, the sale of urban household 
registration in order to raise funds and other "nonstandard" 
securities issues, according to an estimate by the headquarters 
of the People's Bank of China, the total value would be about 
270 billion yuan. At the end of 1992, the outstanding balance 
of securities monitored by statistics in our country was 410 
billion yuan. Seen from the proportion between direct financing 
and indirect financing, excluding the 25.5 billion yuan of 
financial bonds, in 1992 the total volume of direct financing 
throughout our country was 194.5 billion yuan. This was 
equivalent to 54.6 percent of the increase in state bank credit 
in that year (356.3 billion yuan). It was also equivalent to 46 
percent of the increase in credit issued by financial organs 
(including state banks, credit and investment organs and urban 
and rural credit cooperatives) throughout the country in that 
year (422.8 billion yuan). The proportion of the year's newly 
increased total financing constituted by newly increased direct 
financing rose from 12 percent in 1991 to 31.5 percent in 1992. 
This means that changes have occurred in the mechanism for 
transforming our country's savings into investment. However, it 
also shows that the effectiveness of some of the current 
macroeconomic money regulation and control measures is being 
further weakened. (For the various data noted above, see Xie 
Ping, 1993) 
  The handing down of such autonomy clearly exacerbates the 
"competition under soft constraints" under the decentralized 
state-owned economy and increases economic instability. It is 
thus inevitably linked with chaos in the financial sphere. Our 
economy has, since the beginning of 1992, not only entered a new 
round of fluctuation basically the same as those in the past, 
but has also entered a new round of high-speed growth which is 
faster than that in the past. The fact that the economy has, 
even more quickly, seen the appearance of "overheating" 
illustrates this point very clearly. 
  The current question is which policies the government should 
adopt in order to counteract this instability so as to ensure 
that the degree of fluctuation is the smallest possible. 
<H3>  6. The Current Countermeasure Thinking for Macroeconomic 
Stability: `Dual-Track Regulation and Control' </H3>
  On the basis of the analysis above of the economic 
fluctuations in the eighties and the effectiveness of the 
various macroeconomic stability (retrenchment) policies, and in 
accordance with the analysis above of the current economic 
structural situation and the structural causes for the new round 
of high-speed economic growth, we can put forward the following 
lines of thought on countermeasures. 
  6.1--Gradual reform and macroeconomic regulation and 
control 
  In the current process of choosing policies for 
macroeconomic 
stability, we have to first clarify the following major issues: 
First, at present, the issues we need to clarify, especially on 
the level of understanding, are: 1) The effectiveness of 
different macroeconomic regulatory and control policies depends 
on different economic structural conditions, especially on the 
"microeconomic base" of the economy. 2) We must develop a 
market economy, but our current economic structure is still not 
a market economy, while the "microeconomic base" of 
macroeconomic operation is far from the "microeconomic base" of 
a market economy. Thus, many macroeconomic stability policies 
which are effective under market economy conditions are, under 
current structural conditions, actually unable to play an 
effective role. This is prominently manifested by the fact that 
the state-owned economic sectors, which are still to a large 
degree dependent for their operation on administrative links at 
present, can only be restrained through the use of 
administrative measures, and in a situation where localities and 
enterprises still lack internal self-restraint mechanisms, it is 
still necessary to retain a certain amount of external 
restraint. Each economic structure has its own special logic, 
and this cannot be violated. At present, we want to put great 
effort into developing a market economy structure. However, 
this mainly requires that we put effort into structural reform, 
and especially into transforming the economic base of the 
economy (this we will analyze below). It does not mean that at 
present we can completely change the "policies" and "measures" 
by which the economy is managed. If, at present, we blindly use 
market economy macroeconomic policies, which have not yet seen 
obvious results, to manage our economy, it will not really be 
beneficial to the development of the economy and will not be a 
real act of "marketization." 
  Second, structural reform is a process which requires quite 
a 
long period of time to see results, while macroeconomic 
regulation and control is a near-term problem of "overall demand 
management." The two must not be confused. Thus, the claim that 
"through deepening reform, we can achieve macroeconomic 
stability at present" is an idea which may sound correct, but is 
not. Reform must be intensified, and this is particularly so at 
present. However, prior to the completion of the reforms, we 
still face the problem of how, under the current set structural 
conditions, we are to carry out macroeconomic regulation and 
control. The correct statement is that "through deepening 
reform, we can achieve long-term economic stability." 
  Third, although our economy is not yet a complete market 
economy, it is no longer completely a planned economy. Rather, 
it is in a changeover stage as it makes the transition from the 
old structure to the new structure. Its basic characteristic is 
a "structural dual track." China has adopted a "gradual" mode 
for its reforms. The basic characteristic of this mode of 
structural change is: It does not suddenly destroy the vested 
interests formed under the old structure. Rather, in the early 
period of reform, it appropriately maintains the vested 
interests, so as to reduce the social obstructions faced by the 
reforms. Thus, the overall process of economic reform does not 
involve first destroying the old structure, but rather involves 
first developing new structural components at the "side" or in 
the "cracks" of the old structure. Following the development of 
the new structural components, and the expansion of the 
proportions which they constitute in the overall economy, there 
will be gradual deepening of the transformation of the old 
structure. 
  This mode of reform will naturally mean that the process of 
reform is characterized by "dual-track transition." That is to 
say, for quite a long period there will a situation where the 
new and the old systems and the two types of economic components 
coexist. The new structure will have been partially formed, but 
the old structure will continue to exist and its absolute scale 
may even continue to grow. The two types of structures will 
continue to play roles in the economy, but after a certain 
period of transition, the change from the old structure to the 
new structure will be completed for the overall economy. The 
"dual-track transition" can be said to be the basic form of the 
"gradual mode of reform." Here, "dual-track transition" not 
only refers to a "dual-track pricing system," but also means 
"dual-track property rights" and many other types of specific 
dual-track structures. We can see that during the process of 
our country's economic structural reforms, in every sphere there 
will exist this "dual-track transition" form. 
  When components from the different types of structures 
coexist in the same economy, it is inevitable that there will be 
mutual restraints and that they will play a role regarding each 
other. Also, the activity mode of each will inevitably affect 
the other. However, as the basic operational mechanisms of the 
two structures are different and, in the end, they differ in 
terms of their activity modes, their reactions when facing the 
same kinds of economic changes, government policies and external 
pummelling will also be different. This then produces the 
macroeconomic management level question of how to adopt 
different policy measures to carry out regulation and control in 
respect of the different economic components. Thus, during the 
period of structural transition, the realization of an 
appropriate structural dual track clearly requires that the 
macroeconomic regulation and control measures are themselves 
also "dual-track." By using only one method, it will not be 
possible to achieve the hoped-for results. This is prominently 
manifested in the fact that actually, at present, we do not have 
any macroeconomic regulatory and control measures, either direct 
or indirect, "market-driven" or "administrative," "monetary" or 
"planning" measures, which can very effectively carry out 
regulation and control of the overall economy. However, on the 
other hand, none of the current regulatory and control measures 
are completely useless. They all have a role to play to a 
certain degree and over a certain range. This requires that we 
"comprehensively" utilize the various types of measures, so that 
we can carry out "comprehensive regulation and control" of the 
economy. (Fan Gang, 1992) 
  6.2--"Dual-track regulation and control" 
  "Comprehensive regulation and control" will, during the 
period of "dual-track transition," be specifically manifested as 
"dual-track regulation and control." The basic line of thinking 
on this is as follows. 
  On the one hand, in respect of the non-state-owned economy, 
it means using indirect regulatory and control policies which 
have already begun to show a certain effect, such as monetary 
policies and taxation policies. In particular, we must 
strengthen the use of interest rates. Even though the 
state-owned economic sectors will not at present be sensitive to 
this, we already have a quite large non-state-owned economy 
which is quite sensitive to interest rates (when other 
conditions remain the same, personal savings always react to 
interest rates), and the other types of indirect regulatory and 
control policies have also already shown themselves to be quite 
effective in these areas. 
  In another respect, in regulating and controlling the 
state-owned economic sectors which are at present still 
maintained through reliance on administrative links, we should 
continue to use direct administrative control measures to a 
certain degree. In particular, we must, in a timely way, 
directly control investment activities and consumption of public 
funds. In the analysis above, we have already seen that at 
present, only direct measures are effective measures for 
controlling the scale of final demand in a decentralized 
state-ownership economy. At the same time, we should 
appropriately strengthen management and control over the issue 
of securities and direct financing by local governments and 
state-owned enterprises. (There is no need to excessively 
intervene in the direct financing activities of non-state-owned 
enterprises. It is only necessary to strengthen the 
establishment and implementation of regulations.) The basic line 
of thinking is that in respect of economic activity principals 
which have not yet formed internal self-restraint mechanisms, we 
must maintain necessary external restraints. 
  At the same time, we should not implement excessively tight 
regulatory and control measures in respect of credit. Under 
current structural conditions, if we implement excessively tight 
credit controls (reducing the scale of planned credit), it will 
basically be a uniform administrative control on financing, and 
that may produce a quite strong "counter-choice" reaction--a 
reaction whereby credit which should be blocked is not really 
subject to much restraint, while that which should not be 
stopped is the first to bear the brunt of the measures. For 
example, as soon as there is excessive tightening up on funds, 
the state-owned enterprises which do not have good results or 
which incur losses can still use new credit to maintain their 
existence. However, profitable enterprises with deposits fall 
into difficulties when funds are blocked, and they are unable to 
even draw on their own funds. Thus, their potential cannot be 
brought into play. The non-state-owned enterprises which 
originally had difficulty obtaining credit find it even more 
difficult to obtain funds, their development is restricted, and 
so on. 
  In the process of marketization, we need not feel a "taboo" 
about continuing to use "administrative measures" for direct 
control. However, we must particularly ensure that we do not 
implement "uniform"-type administrative controls over the entire 
economy. More importantly, we should not implement 
administrative management over the non-state-owned economy. 
Seen from the relationship between macroeconomic regulation and 
control and the marketization reforms, a major advantage of 
"dual-track regulation and control" is that it manages that 
which should be managed and only regulates that which should be 
freed. It does not manage these two things together. This is 
beneficial to having the overall economy make the transition 
toward the "single-track" of the market economy, and finally 
abandoning administrative measures. Doing things in this way is 
actually beneficial rather than disadvantageous to the 
development of the market economy. 
  6.3--"Retaining some things and discarding others": 
How to develop the market mechanism in the current process of 
readjusting financial order 
  The aim of "dual-track regulation and control" is not to 
maintain the existing economic structure and the administrative 
measures for intervening in the economy. Rather, it is intended 
for better making the transition to the market economy. Thus, 
during the period of transition, in the process of carrying out 
"dual-track regulation and control" of the economy, it is very 
important that we should clarify what we should give up and what 
we should put great efforts into developing. 
  In the early period, the main problem in macroeconomic 
stability will be chaos in the financial market, and there is a 
need to engage in readjustment, including the use of 
administrative measures to implement necessary restraints. 
However, in the process of readjusting the financial market, it 
is also necessary to avoid the practice of "implementing in a 
uniform way." Rather, we should "retain some things and give up 
others." Specifically, there are problems in two areas to which 
we should pay attention: 
  First, we should avoid the complete abolition of the 
"secondary funds market." For example, at the same time as 
handling the problem of inter-borrowing of funds, we should 
consider how to better develop a funds market. A major element 
by which the reform of our country's financial structure lags 
behind the reforms in other spheres is that we have not, in a 
timely way, implemented in the financial sector a "dual-track 
interest rate system" which is in accord with the law and which 
is subject to state supervision and management. Interest rates 
are the price of funds use. Over the last few years, in our 
country's product markets, many prices have, after making the 
transition through a long period of the "dual-track system," 
been gradually freed, and the reform of marketization has been 
realized. However, in respect of interest rates, it is still 
the case that the state sets the prices. The result of this is 
not that we have not seen the appearance of "dual-track 
pricing," but rather that we have not seen clearly priced 
"dual-track pricing" which is "in accordance with the law," 
which is subject to state management, and from which the 
interest income goes to the state rather than into the pockets 
of private individuals. What have appeared are "black markets" 
and "gray markets" for funds, as well as "official speculation 
in funds" and "financial corruption." Thus, here there actually 
exists the problem of how to squarely face the objective laws of 
the development of things and intensify "price reform" in the 
funds market. Over the last few years, in the financial sector, 
the area in which regulation through market mechanism has played 
a major role has been inter-borrowing funds. The 
inter-borrowing funds market is actually to a certain degree 
equivalent to the development of a nonstandardized funds market 
which is not subject to management, and is outside the 
traditional credit system in which interest rates are difficult 
to change and credit is subject to planning controls. To a 
certain degree, this forms another price for credit funds. At 
present, many non-state-owned companies and enterprises find it 
difficult to obtain credit under the state credit plans, and 
thus they can only obtain their funds through various forms of 
"inter-borrowing." In this sphere, because many things are "not 
in accordance with the law" and there is a lack of effective 
supervision, there exists great chaos. For example, a large 
part of interest rate differentials flows into the pockets of 
individuals. A large part of inter-borrowing funds is used by 
some state-owned or semi-state-owned financial and real estate 
companies, which have special links with banks, to invest in the 
securities and real estate markets. However, in the final 
analysis, through this avenue some funds are deployed by the 
market to production sectors where interest rates are quite 
high. Thus, at present, on the one hand we must readjust the 
funds market, so as to stop illegal inter-borrowing, and 
"uncouple" some companies from banks, while on the other hand we 
have to consider how to develop an "interest rate dual-track 
system" which accords with the law and is subject to supervision 
and management. We must not simply recover the "inter-borrowing 
funds," again institute firm and unchanging interest rates, and 
forcibly return to the "single planning track" which has been 
proved by practice to be ineffective and not feasible. If we 
continue to institute unitary "planned interest rates," and the 
rates never float, the result will inevitably be the 
re-emergence of "gray markets" and corruption. As compared to 
this, it would be better to first let the interest rates for 
some funds "legitimately" move in accordance with market prices, 
and appropriately allow some bank funds to be loaned out "beyond 
the plans" at market interest rates. This would be like when we 
initially allowed enterprises to have the prices of some of 
their products set by the market, and they were free to sell 
them at those prices. This will not only be beneficial to the 
effective use of funds, and beneficial to the reform of the 
financial system, but will also be beneficial to the development 
of the non-state-owned economy. Having credit funds subject to 
unified central control and managing them very tightly will not 
injure the state-owned enterprises. They are always "guaranteed 
funds come rain or shine." The ones to feel the brunt of such 
measures will certainly be the various types of non-state-owned 
economy operations. Even initially they had a hard time getting 
anything from the "credit plans" basket. If the financing 
avenues outside the plans are abolished, their development will 
certainly suffer seriously. This will be very disadvantageous to 
the growth and development of our country's market economy 
mechanism and to the sustained development of the overall 
economy (the development of the market economy and economic 
growth over the last 10-plus years have mainly depended on the 
development of various forms of non-state-owned economy 
operations). 
  Second, in the process of readjusting the financial market, 
we should strengthen management over non-state-owned, 
nongovernment financial organs (cooperative and 
shareholding-type credit organizations and banks, as well as 
private banks). However, we should not restrict their 
development. On the contrary, in order to further develop the 
market economy, we should adopt more open policies, and allow 
and encourage the development of non-state-owned financial 
organs. In the view of the authors, in terms of the process of 
reform of the financial structure, an aspect which is lagging 
behind at present is the development of non-state-owned, 
nongovernment financial organs. Up to now, the measures adopted 
have been to restrict rather than to encourage nongovernment 
financial organs. Thus, while, in the overall economy, the 
national income created by the various forms of non-state-owned 
economic entities has already reached 50 percent of gross 
national income, in financial activities, the proportion 
constituted by nongovernment financial organs is still very 
small, and the figure is not commensurate with the development 
of the overall non-state-owned economy. A major excuse given 
for restricting the development of nongovernment financial 
organs is that these financial organs will "cause chaos to 
normal financial order." The problem, however, lies in what is 
meant by "normal financial order." In the financial sphere, the 
most basic and most important order is "requiring repayment of 
monies borrowed." It is on this point, we are afraid, that the 
nongovernment financial organs are the greatest respecters of 
"normal order." It is difficult to imagine a nongovernment bank 
continually approving loans to an enterprise which is a heavy 
loss-maker and which fails to repay repeated loans. Is it not 
on this point that our state-owned banks are those with the 
greatest disrespect for "normal order"? The problems are which 
order do we want to maintain? Do we want to establish a new 
order which is in accord with the patterns of the market economy? 
  Developing nongovernment financial organs does not mean that 
we should abandon management of financial order by the 
government and the state-owned central bank. On the contrary, 
the development of the nongovernment financial organs will be of 
benefit in strengthening such management and making it more 
effective. In fact, the central bank has great difficulty in 
implementing effective management of the various state-owned 
commercial banks. The reason for this lies in the fact that the 
central bank and state-owned commercial banks, like state-owned 
enterprises and the various levels of local government, are all 
state-owned, and none of them can say to the others that they 
alone "have authority." They all have a thousand ways in which 
to "finance" their needs. However, the central bank, 
representing the state, can exercise management over 
nongovernment financial organs. This is relatively easier and 
more effective, the interests of the two sides are clearly 
demarcated, and the monetary regulation and control measures of 
the central bank will be more authoritarian. In market economy 
countries around the world, it is the central bank which 
controls non-state-owned commercial banks, and the effectiveness 
of government monetary policies is built on this basis. Why do 
we consider that allowing the development of nongovernment 
financial organs will result in great chaos? In the early 
period of the development of nongovernment financial organs, 
because of the supersession of the old system by the new, it 
will be difficult to avoid some confusion, but through 
perfecting laws and strengthening management it will be possible 
to ensure that the new structure and the new order are gradually 
established. However, if we do not allow the development of 
nongovernment financial organs, it will not be possible to 
establish a new order and it will not be possible for the 
government to gradually learn through practice how to manage 
nongovernment financial organs. This will result in our always 
lagging behind in financial structure reform. In the early 
period of the development of our non-state-owned production 
enterprises, there were also many problems, leading to many 
people accusing them of harming "normal economic order." 
However, what they were actually doing was playing an important 
and positive role in breaking down the old traditional planning 
structure and order, in establishing a new market economy 
structure and order, and in accelerating economic development. 
  The basic experiences of our reforms of gradual 
marketization 
over the last 10-plus years have involved: 1) Using a 
"dual-track pricing system" to break down and gradually replace 
the old planning structure; 2) through developing the 
non-state-owned economy, changing the property rights structure 
of the overall economy, forming more market activity principals, 
and, through a "structural dual track," making the transition to 
a market economy. The reason our market economy has been able 
to take embryonic form and the reason our economy has been able 
to maintain a growth momentum during the reforms is that we have 
relied on these two aspects. In the current process of 
deepening the reform of the financial structure, we cannot 
forget these two precious experiences of our "gradual mode of 
reform." 
  6.4--The basic route for achieving long-term stability: 
Speeding the pace of property rights reform 
  As far as long-term stability is concerned, we not only must 
actively carry out reform of the banking structure, the 
financial structure and the macroeconomic management system, but 
also need to step up and deepen reform in other aspects. In 
particular, we need to intensify reform in terms of property 
rights relations in the state-owned economy. The 15-year 
history of our reform and opening up has shown that as far as 
the state-owned economy is concerned, purely "handing down power 
and allowing retention of profits," while not carrying out 
reform of ownership relations, cannot resolve the problem of 
macroeconomic stability. Our current economic instability is, 
to a great degree, due to the "handing down of power and 
allowing retention of profits" in a situation where there has 
been no reform of ownership relations in the state ownership 
economy. The result is that localities and enterprises have the 
"right" to seek their own interests, but there is still no one 
who will take real responsibility for capital losses, the 
"budgetary restraints" have still not been "firmed," and the 
relationship between the government and enterprises has not seen 
any essential change. The so-called "sluggishness in financial 
reform" is actually due to the sluggishness of property rights 
reform in the state-owned economy, which in turn "drags back" 
financial reform. The situations in various respects show that 
we have already reached the stage where we have to accelerate 
reform centered on property rights. Reform of property rights 
relationships has become a pressing issue. 
  Some property rights reform measures which are feasible and 
where we should begin at present include: Clarifying the 
specific ownership representatives or ownership principals for 
state-owned assets (including land); through legislation, 
clearly setting down the scope and volume of state-owned assets; 
and appropriately defining and distinguishing central ownership 
rights and local ownership rights. After this, we should widely 
promote the "company corporatization" of state-owned enterprises 
and, in the majority of state-run enterprises, implement a 
system by which state assets are converted into shares, so as to 
turn them into limited liability companies (not necessarily 
"listed companies"). Through this mode, we will be able to 
clearly define and quantify the property rights relationships of 
state-owned enterprises. Thereby, we will ensure that property 
rights in respect of state-owned assets are quantified property 
rights which can be divided, which can be traded and which can 
be transferred. This will create beneficial conditions for the 
further stable reform of ownership relations in future in 
accordance with the demands of the market economy and in 
accordance with the demands of efficiency standards. The 
property rights relations of the state-owned economy need to be 
reformed, while within the non- state-owned economy there also 
exist problems such as property rights not being protected, 
property rights not being clear and so on. These problems also 
need to be resolved through reform. In this aspect at present, 
we should set about the following work: Protecting property 
rights and encouraging various types of private investment, so 
that the various types of non-state-owned economic entities see 
more healthy and more stable development, so as to reduce the 
extravagant consumption and the large-scale outflow of national 
capital which have already appeared, and so as to speed the 
accumulation of social capital. In town and township 
enterprises and the various types of cooperative and collective 
economy operations at present, there exists in very many cases 
the problem of property rights relationships not being clear, 
and this has already affected the development of the economy and 
the accumulation of capital. Thus, we should speed the reform 
of property rights. The main route at present is through 
promoting, in the collective economy, the "shareholding 
cooperative system" which has emerged in practice, to ensure 
that the collective property rights of the past, which 
previously could not be divided and could not be traded, become 
divisible and capable of being traded. 
  Theoretical analysis and practical experiences have both 
proved that if we do not start out with reform of basic economic 
relationships, and do not reform the activity modes of 
state-owned enterprises and local governments, so as to form 
market economy mechanisms, we will never be able to break free 
from the cycle in which "relaxation gives rise to chaos and 
taking back power results in stagnation," those indirect 
regulatory measures which have proved effective in market 
economies will never be adopted in our economy, and we will 
never achieve the hoped-for results.

<F P=106> [By Ren Zhongping (0117 0112 1627): "Establish a Large, </F>
Unified, Open, Competitive, and Orderly Market"] 
  [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee has set forth the grand objective of initially 
establishing a socialist market economic system by the turn of 
the century. According to the decision adopted by the session, 
an important and pressing basic task before us is to make 
strenuous efforts to establish a large, unified, open, 
competitive, and orderly market [tong yi kai tang jing zheng you 
xu da shi cheng 4827 0001 7030 2397 4552 3630 2589 1645 1129 
1579 1034]. 
  A market system is the core of the market economic system 
and 
the base where the role of the market mechanism can be brought 
into play. Without a perfect market for commodities and 
essential factors, the basic role of resources distributed by 
the market will be out of the question. What kind of a market 
do we intend to establish? To make it simple, it should have 
the following features: Unified and not decentralized, open and 
not closed, competitive and not monopolized, and orderly and not 
confused. 
  Unified, open, competitive, and orderly are the essential 
requirements of a market economy. Openness is the premise of 
economic activities, competitiveness is the source of economic 
efficiency, and rules are the guarantee for economic order. 
Only when the market is unified, open, competitive, and orderly 
can the role of the market mechanism be brought into play, can 
the optimized distribution of resources be ensured, and can 
vitality and efficiency of the economy be maintained. 
  Since reform and opening up, China's commodity market has 
developed rapidly, the market for essential factors has been 
nurtured, and the role of the market mechanism has been brought 
into play in certain fields. However, we should admit that 
China's market system is still at the initial stage, which 
cannot meet the needs of the rapidly developing economy and 
which has restrained the national economy as a whole like a 
bottle neck. For this reason, it is necessary to accelerate the 
pace of market building. The following three outstanding 
problems should be resolved at present: Market decentralization, 
market monopoly, and confused market order. 
<H6>  I. </H6>
  Market decentralization refers mainly to barriers erected 
between regions. Some localities proceed from their partial 
interests, restrict the activities of neighbors, practice local 
protectionism, and limit the flow of commodities and resources. 
When there is a short supply of a certain commodity or 
resource, they try to restrict its outflow. When a certain 
local commodity is unmarketable, they restrict the inflow of 
fine quality commodities from other localities. The artificial 
barriers hinder the flow of commodities and the establishment of 
a unified market nationwide. 
  From a short-term point of view, the barriers may protect 
the 
interests of a certain locality and its enterprises. From a 
long- term point of view, however, it will harm the interests of 
that locality and its enterprises because such protectionism 
runs counter to market rules, rejects competition, and plays a 
negative role of protecting backwardness. A child cannot grow 
up in its mother's bosom and an enterprise which has not 
withstood storms will not be competitiveness. The establishment 
of a unified market is the trend of the times. The sooner we 
open up, the sooner we will benefit. Otherwise, we will suffer. 
This has been proved by the practice of many localities. In 
establishing a unified market, besides removing barriers erected 
between the regions within the country, it is also necessary to 
make preparations to connect our market with that of the world. 
When China's status as signatory of GATT is resumed, we will 
further open our market to the outside world. Only by taking 
part in competition in the market without barriers as early as 
possible can enterprises adapt themselves to the storms in the 
domestic and international market. 
  The removal of barriers erected between regions does not 
mean 
that we do not want to develop regional markets. The 
development of regional markets is not equivalent to erecting 
barriers. A regional market is formed by the natural technical 
features of commodities, regional production, and consumption 
rather than by administrative and artificial barriers. We 
should develop such a regional market, which will become a 
component part of the unified national market. In market 
building, the establishment of some regional markets in light of 
administrative divisions is a normal phenomenon. As long as we 
do not make such a market inflexible, it will conform to 
economic laws and converge with a unified national market. 
  The key to breaking through regional barriers and 
establishing a unified and open market lies in deepened reform. 
On the one hand, acceleration of reform of the financial and 
taxation system, implementation of a separate taxation system, 
and transformation of the financial contract system can weaken 
the foundation of interests of local protectionism, which will 
help remove market barriers. On the other hand, acceleration of 
enterprise reform, establishment of the enterprise bankruptcy 
system and a social insurance system, and invigoration of 
enterprise competitiveness in the market can alleviate the 
pressure of the government in undertaking "protection" 
responsibility. Naturally, the state must also adopt 
legislative means to ensure that the market is open and to stop 
the practice of erecting barriers. 
<H6>  II. </H6>
  Market monopoly refers mainly to monopoly by departments and 
trades, monopoly by a unitary state economy, and monopoly 
related to some outdated policies. Since reform, the structure 
of China's departmental monopoly and of the public economic 
sector unifying the whole country has been smashed. Other 
economic sectors are now allowed to enter a number of fields and 
nonpublic sectors are allowed to take part in economic 
development and competition, which have enormously invigorated 
these fields. Nevertheless, there are still some competitive 
fields which are monopolized by some departments and nonpublic 
enterprises are still restricted from operation in some fields. 
It will be impossible to ensure fair competition if there is 
inequality in fields where certain nonpublic enterprises are 
allowed to enter. Moreover, to encourage some enterprises to 
explore reform experience, the state offered some preferential 
policies during the initial period of reform which were 
absolutely necessary and which played an enormous role in 
promoting reform and economic development. When the reform 
measures are popularized, however, the continued retention of 
the "preferential policies" for certain enterprises will be 
unfair to the vast number of other enterprises. As such a 
"monopoly which is related to policy" does not conform to the 
establishment of a market which encourages fair competition, it 
should be removed in the course of deepened reform. 
  The greatest harm of market monopoly is that it rejects 
competition, which hinders nurturing of the market, reduces 
economic efficiency, and gives rise to disorder and corruption. 
In the course of the transition from a highly centralized 
planned economy to a market economy, the most important and 
arduous task is to smash monopolies. Naturally, while the state 
must exercise a monopoly over a small number of special 
commodities which are related to the lifelines of the national 
economy, restrictions on other departments and economic sectors 
should be lifted and they should be allowed to take part in 
competition and promote development. Even in the trades where a 
state monopoly is essential, it is necessary to introduce a 
competition mechanism, carry out competition between 
enterprises, and increase efficiency. In order to better 
implement the policy of coexistence of various economic sectors 
based on the predominance of the public sector and encourage the 
normal growth of nonpublic sectors, it is necessary to effect a 
shift from the basis of ownership to industrial needs in 
formulating policies, abolish discriminative and restrictive 
policies, gradually recall special preferential policies 
offered to certain enterprises during a specified period, 
abolish monopoly policies, and ensure fair competition. In 
order to weaken and eventually remove the powers of resource 
distribution of certain government departments, it is necessary 
to increase the scope of government reform and change the 
functions of government organs so they can shift from 
microeconomic activities to comprehensive management and 
delegate powers to the market and enterprises. The state should 
also formulate anti- monopoly laws and protect competition. 
Some comrades are worried that the lifting of restrictions on 
the market and elimination of the monopoly of the public 
economic sector will shake the position of socialist public 
ownership. The predominance of socialist public ownership 
should be manifested in the national economy and control over 
the lifelines of the national economy rather than the 
superiority in the quantity of state enterprises or the 
undertaking of all trades and professions by state enterprises. 
Only by eliminating monopoly and encouraging the common 
development of various economic sectors can we arouse the 
enthusiasm of all fields to resolve the difficulties of capital 
shortages in China's construction and promote economic 
prosperity. Although the individual and private economic 
sectors have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still 
insufficient. The output value of the individual and private 
enterprises in China accounted for only 4.1 percent of the 
country's total industrial output value in 1992. Therefore, 
there is still a wide scope for their development. 
  Competition requires a certain scale. In other words, there 
must be a considerable number of enterprises in each trade. 
Only when there is a large scale of competition can we have 
full competition and give play to its role. In China, which has 
a vast territory, large population, and huge market, it will be 
impossible to meet market needs without competition of scale. 
Competition is also conducive to economy of scale because we 
can allow the best to survive through competition, merge 
enterprises and concentrate assets, and form an economy of 
scale. Such economy of scale will be the result of competition 
on equal footing. As it is not "a plate of assorted dishes 
pieced together" by force, which rejects competition, it will 
inevitably turn out genuine efficiency of scale. 
<H6>  III. </H6>
  The confused market order at present has attracted public 
attention. The chaotic phenomena of counterfeit goods, short 
measures, false advertisements, illegal pooling of funds, tax 
evasion, and smuggling have disrupted normal market order, given 
rise to corruption, and harmed the interests of enterprises and 
the masses. A special feature of the chaotic phenomena is not 
keeping promises, not observing to rules, and defying laws and 
discipline. Some people say that this is the result of a market 
economy, which is a complete misunderstanding of the market 
economy. A market economy is not an economy without order. A 
market economy is an economy which adheres to rules and the 
legal system. In the course of a market economy, the market 
body is diversified, economic policy decisions are 
decentralized, and economic connections are complicated. To 
ensure effective operation and fair and full competition of the 
economy, it is necessary to strictly establish market rules and 
effectively maintain market order. The practice of many 
developed nations has proved this point. They have used a 
mature market economy to overcome the initial deficiencies of a 
commodity economy. 
  The establishment of a socialist market economic system is 
an unprecedented cause. The occurrence of the chaotic phenomena 
will be unavoidable in a change of the system from the old to 
the new. The substitution of a new system for the old one and 
the frictions between the two will inevitably result in 
management loopholes, a vacuum in regulations, lax discipline, 
and misbehavior. As the chaotic phenomenon is due to 
insufficient rather than excessive development of the market 
economy, the problem can be fundamentally resolved only through 
accelerating reform and expediting market growth. He who 
carries out full competition by following the principle of 
fairness, honesty, and trustworthiness is the most effective 
defender of a market order. The abolition of market monopoly, 
barriers, and inappropriate means of competition will fully 
develop competition and exert great market pressure on 
enterprises. Enterprises will have internal binding force by 
speeding up the reform of the enterprise system and genuinely 
developing a mechanism of assuming sole responsibility for 
profits and losses. The establishment of market rules, 
strengthening of market management, and enhancement of a sense 
of trustworthiness, contract, and law will plug loopholes and 
further restrain enterprise behavior and standardize market 
order. 
  Concrete analysis should be made of the chaotic phenomena. 
It is necessary to resolutely resist the chaotic phenomena as 
they run counter to the basic rules of a market economy. Some 
phenomena are regarded as "disorder" from the traditional 
planned economic viewpoint, but economic vitality and the bud of 
a new system from a market economic viewpoint, which should be 
vigorously supported and not contained. Although some phenomena 
are related to "chaos," they are caused by market stagnation, 
reflecting the needs of accelerating market development, which 
must be standardized and guided rather than simply negated. For 
example, the chaotic phenomenon of illegal lending which took 
place in the financial field was a reflection of the capital 
market stagnation, which can only be effectively resolved by 
vigorously enhancing the building of the capital market. In 
short, we should learn how to apply the method of a market 
economy to curb the chaos and introduce reforms rather than 
restriction for the chaotic phenomena. With the checking of the 
chaotic phenomena as the opportunity, we should accelerate the 
pace of reform, smash the vicious cycle of "opening up resulting 
in chaos, chaos in restriction, and restriction in rigidity," 
and enter a new realm of orderly development. Market oriented 
reform has boosted the economy and improved the people's living 
standards. China's economy has never been so vigorous and the 
market has never been so prosperous as the one today. Despite 
the chaos amid vitality, vitality is essential. We may say that 
the chaotic phenomenon is the price paid for reform and 
development and that there can be no success without a price. 
With the spirit of holding ourselves highly responsible to the 
people, we should work conscientiously, be bold as well as 
prudent, and try to exchange the greatest success for the least 
price. 
  As this year is a crucial one for implementing the decision 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
we should be determined to make strenuous efforts to promote 
reform in a down-to-earth manner; earnestly resolve the problems 
of market barriers, monopoly, and chaos; remove obstacles in 
market building; and push the market forward in a unified, open, 
competitive, and orderly direction.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government will be "cautious" on futures markets despite an 
expected rise in futures trading this year, officials and 
experts say. 
  The current policy calls for "positive but cautious 
development of futures trading," said Gao Shangquan, head of a 
governmental research institution on economic reform. 
  To achieve the purpose, he said, the State Council will 
launch a number of pilot projects on futures trading while 
striving to improve the relevant legislation and supervision 
mechanisms. 
  "The approach is to dig a `canal' first and then divert 
water 
into it, instead of letting it overflow," added Gao, who was 
formerly a vice-minister of the State Commission on Economic 
Restructuring. 
  State-imposed prices are being canceled as part of China's 
market-oriented economic reform, "prompting enterprises to 
safeguard the value of their products by engaging in futures 
trading," Gao said. 
  Profit returns from futures trading, usually high, may also 
help increase its business volume, he added. 
  However, he said, futures trading involves high risk and is 
still in the initial stage of development in China. "Neither 
the country's conditions nor the actual demand allow an 
immediate boom of the business. 
  "Laws and government decrees on futures trading will be 
published only after repeated experiments under the State 
Council," said Gao, now a senior researcher with the commission. 
  "Even in the future, futures trading should be handled with 
care," he said. 
  Gao said that government officials and experts are drafting 
a 
set of provisional regulations concerning futures trading and 
planning the establishment of official bodies to administer the 
futures markets. 
  Meanwhile, China's first futures law is being formulated, he 
said. 
  Gao said that "tight control" is being imposed over entry of 
funds from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and foreign countries 
into futures markets on the Chinese mainland. And the 
government also advises Chinese citizens to be "cautious" in 
international futures trading. 
  But Gao said that participation in the world futures market 
is the ultimate goal of China. "The problem is that China has 
yet to meet some of the basic requirements for taking part in 
international futures trading," he said. 
  In 1990, Zhengzhou in central China established the 
country's 
first grain and edible oil trading market. The country now has 
38 commodity exchanges and wholesale markets, dealing with 
petroleum, iron, steel and chemicals as well as food. There are 
also some 200 registered futures trading companies. 
  "The progress has been rapid, but problems are many," Gao 
said, noting that the government has had to close down what he 
called "underground companies" -- "companies" unlicensed and 
failing to qualify for futures trading. 
  In a nationwide futures craze in 1993, some got quick money 
but many went bankrupt overnight, Gao said. 
  Some profiteering merchants from outside the Chinese 
mainland 
also took advantage of the confusion to drain off China's 
revenue, Gao said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Growth of China's 
posts and telecommunications industry saw a growth rate as high 
as 58.9 percent in 1993, surpassing that of the whole national 
economy for the ninth successive year. 
  Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, 
announced here today in a national telephone conference that the 
major economic data of the industry and telecommunications 
capacity have set new records in the past year. 
  Newly-increased long distance telecommunications lines 
reached 200,000, nearing the total capacity constructed in the 
years before 1992; telephone switch capacity increased an 
all-time-high 12.86 million lines, bringing the national 
capacity of urban and rural telephone network to more than 40 
million lines. 
  Wu said that in 1993 the industry's investment in fixed 
assets hit 40 billion yuan, 2.5 times the sum of 1992. 
  In constructing postal facilities, major attention was paid 
to speedy transportation networks, with two trunk lines for 
postal container trucks opened; the first batch imported 
machines for automatic letter sorting started operation in 
Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and some other cities; 29 provincial 
capital cities began to use computers for distributing 
newspapers and magazines; and computer consultation systems for 
express mail service were set up in big and coastal cities. 
  Wu said that last year eight optical communication cables 
were opened; construction of 14 satellite earth stations were 
basically finished; program-controlled telephones constituted 86 
percent of the national telephone network. 
  In 1993 urban and rural telephone subscribers increased 5.86 
million [as received]. Now there are 2.15 telephones for every 
100 people of the country's population, while in cities the rate 
is seven percent. 
  In addition, in 1993 subscribers for mobile telephones 
increased 461,000, bringing the total number to 638,000; while 
users of wireless pagers increased by 3.38 million, bringing the 
total figure to 5.6 million. 
  Wu said in 1994 the industry will expand its investment in 
fixed assets to some 53.6 billion yuan, develop nine million new 
telephone subscribers, increase telephone switch capacity by 12 
million lines, and construct 13 trunk optical cables.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- There are now 
470,000 state-owned enterprises in China with unemployment 
insurance schemes, covering some 74 million employees. 
  Some collectively-owned firms have followed suit. 
  In the first ten months of last year more than 700,000 
unemployed people received benefit funds from the state, 
according to the first issue of the newspaper "CHINA REFORM" 
today. 
  Since China changed its "insurance for people waiting for 
jobs" to unemployment insurance in 1986, a total of 1.2 million 
people have received relief funds. Now the majority of the 
unemployed have found new jobs, according to the paper.

"Beijing Adopts Draft Labor Act; Workers' Trade Unions Are To Be 
Set Up in Foreign-Funded Enterprises"] 
  [Text] The State Council adopted a draft "Labor Act" 
yesterday, the first of its kind in China, in which it is 
stipulated that workers' trade unions are to be set up in 
foreign-funded enterprises. It is learned that problems 
involving the rights and interests of workers and staffers in 
foreign-funded enterprises being violated had aroused the 
concern of the CPC top echelon. 
  A report showed that currently the rights, interests and 
dignity of workers and staffers in quite a number of 
foreign-funded enterprises have been violated and some people 
even said that it was "a repetition of miseries characterized by 
primitive accumulation at the initial stage of capitalism." 
  A recent poll in Guangzhou showed that workers and staffers 
in foreign-funded enterprises had complaints against their 
employers; 30 percent of them said they had been forced to work 
overtime and many said that they had experienced body searches.

  This reporter has recently been in contact with some 
individual cases of workers and staffers in foreign-funded 
enterprises and what they had experienced was quite beyond the 
imagination. 
  The 18-year-old Hua Ming from Hunan told this reporter that 
he had managed to escape from Shenzhen. In May 1992, Hua Ming, 
who came from a poor family, dreamed of bright prospects in 
Shenzhen and eventually took a train heading south and found a 
job at an electronics component assembling factory with a 
monopoly of Hong Kong investment. It was not long before he 
found his dream burst like a soap bubble. He said: "The 
factory was like one big prison. We were shut in on the second 
and third floors of the three-story building working every day, 
with three watch posts inside the house, which was walled by 
electric barbed-wire. One even had to get a pass to go to the 
rest room. The boss always wanted us to work overtime, without 
compensation. I was the most efficient hand in the factory but 
got only 100 yuan a month pay. I felt dizzy working 15 hours a 
day. However, I was lucky compared with those who had lost 
their fingers at punching machines and had been maimed." 
  He further said: "Once I carelessly bumped into the 
supervisor and he kicked me so hard in the small of my back that 
I fell several meters away." 
  The ways the boss penalized workers and staff were 
continuously "updated." For example, ordering everyone to go 
down on their knees, "horse-vaulting" under the scorching sun, 
even shutting workers in the same cage with a dog.... 
  Sometimes the "white-collar" Chinese staff in foreign-funded 
enterprises were humiliated. A female graduate from Beijing 
University worked as the public relations manager in an 
enterprise with monopoly Japanese investment in Hainan and 
earned considerably high income but, at one time, the Japanese 
boss wanted her to spend the night with a Hong Kong businessman. 
She angrily refused and was slapped so hard by the Japanese 
boss that she bled. 
  According to an analysis by a relevant department the causes 
for violations of the legitimate rights and interests of workers 
and staffers in foreign-funded enterprises are complicated. A 
worker at Tianjin service center for foreign investment said: 
"We know that problems are becoming increasingly serious; this 
situation has something to do with the work in various places. 
Today, when some places import foreign investment, they keep 
talking about preferential treatment but say very little about 
control according to the law. Some leading members do not want 
to talk about control lest foreign businessmen be scared away."

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- China will set up 
large- scale coal bases in its northern areas to supply energy 
for the development of its national economy in the 21st century. 
  Named the "three-xi project", it aims to turn Shanxi, 
Shaanxi 
and western (or in Chinese, "xi") Inner Mongolia into China's 
coal bases by the end of this century. "These bases will be 
comprehensive ones covering concerned projects such as coal 
mines, electric power plants, railway transportation, gasworks 
and concrete plants," said a high-ranking official of the 
Ministry of Coal Industry. 
  According to the ongoing work conference on the coal 
industry, the plan will be worked out later this year, and the 
project will be approved at that time. 
  Statistics show that the proven coal deposits in those areas 
account for 63 percent of China's total. By the year 2000, 
about 370 million tons of coal there are expected to be 
allocated to other areas of China. 
  China is rich in coal reserves and coal accounts for about 
75 
percent of its primary energy consumption. 
  In 1993, China's coal output reached 1.14 billion tons, and 
it is expected to top 1.4 billion tons by the end of this 
century. 
  According to experts, China can be divided into three parts 
in terms of coal distribution. The resources in 19 provinces 
lying east of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway are short of 
demands. The "three-xi" areas are rich in coal deposits and 
will supply coal to other areas, while deposits of coal in 
western China meet the region's own demands. 
  The official said that consequently, in the coal producing 
areas with large deposits and high efficiency, a batch of large 
energy bases combining transportation of coal and electric power 
will be set up to support China's national economy. 
  To promote the sustained, fast and healthy development of 
the 
coal industry, the official said, in 1994, no efforts will be 
spared to set up 20 comprehensive development bases with major 
state-owned coal mines as the foundation. 
  Meanwhile, more attention will be paid to the construction 
of 
15 commodity coal mining areas and 100 key coal-producing 
counties with state-owned, locally-run coal mines and township 
coal-mines as their respective mainstays.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (CNS)--According to a national 
work conference on coal production, the Ministry of Coal 
Industry is, with the approval by the State Council, to 
implement a permit system for coal production. 
  The implementation of such a system is necessary in that 
there are many disorders and malpractices in the country's coal 
industry especially in the township enterprises engaging in this 
sector including the disorder in their production, the bad 
condition in their safety and the waste in coal resources. 
[paragraph as published] 
  According to the permit system, coal mines will be asked to 
submit to an examination by departments concerned in order to 
receive a permit before starting up production and those already 
in production will also be required to apply for such a permit 
and those found not qualified will be ordered to improve their 
work, stop their production or be closed.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Agriculture to Get More </F>
Loans"] 
  [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) said yesterday 
at least 10 percent of the country's bank loans should flow into 
the cash-starved agricultural sector this year. 
  The ABC also plans to put forward the suggestion at a 
six-day 
national conference on financial work that opened today with 
participants from all of the country's banks. 
  Last year, only 6 percent of the loans from the country's 
banks were channeled into agriculture, lagging far behind the 
needs in the countryside, said an official with the bank. 
  Bank officials said the ABC will, this year, intensify its 
financial backing for township factories engaged in 
manufacturing high-value-added export products as well as to 
poverty-alleviation projects in remote areas. 
  It lent more than 335.3 billion yuan ($39 billion) to the 
country's township enterprises last year to help them to expand, 
up 63.8 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) from 1992. 
  By the end of last year, ABC's various savings deposits hit 
827.9 billion yuan ($96.3 billion), up 157.2 billion yuan ($18.3 
billion) from the beginning of 1993. 
  Of the total, individual savings accounted for 610.2 billion 
yuan ($71 billion), 126.3 billion yuan ($14.7 billion) higher 
than at the end of 1992. 
  Strong growth in savings deposits enabled the bank to 
increase its lending earmarked for the country's agricultural 
development. 
  Since the central government started its credit-tightening 
policy in June last year, the bank has recalled 5.8 billion yuan 
($674 million) of its inter-bank borrowing to support the rural 
economy. 
  The recalling of the inter-bank borrowing by the bank has 
effectively restricted its non-banking financial companies' 
speculative activities in the country's real estate and stock 
markets. 
  In a firm response to the government's call for strong 
backing of the rural economy, the ABC disbursed nearly 233 
billion yuan ($27 billion) in loans for agricultural production 
last year, up 38 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) from the previous 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Agricultural 
Bank of China (ABC) will add 9 billion yuan to its annual credit 
to agriculture this year, which will lift the bank's credit 
supply to agriculture to a total of 25 billion yuan, according 
to a senior ABC official here today. 
  In addition to the loans provided by the rural credit 
cooperatives across the country, the agricultural sector is 
expected to get over 35 billion yuan in loans for the whole of 
1994. 
  This means a jump of about 45 percent from last year's level 
of 23.8 billion yuan. 
  According to ABC's president Ma Yongwei, the bank will be 
split into two banks: the Agricultural Development Bank and the 
Agricultural Bank of China. 
  The former will be responsible for policy-related lendings 
which will ensure the state purchase of grain, cotton and oil 
seed and channel poverty-relieving funds to most needy areas. 
  Free from the policy-related business, the Agricultural Bank 
of China will begin to operate in the way of a commercial bank. 
  At present the bank as well as the country's banking 
authorities are working at top speed defining the range that 
policy directives will cover and the differing capital fund 
management for the two banks, noted Ma. 
  He said the policy-oriented bank would be established in the 
first half of this year, before the summer harvest begins. 
  This year, the People's Bank of China, The Central Bank, 
will 
stick to the credit quota system to ensure control of total bank 
lending. 
  The ABC president stressed that ABC branch banks would not 
breach the quotas set by the bank authorities.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (CNS)--China's serious gap 
between its east and west has now begun showing signs of 
narrowing. 
  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the gross output 
of 
the township enterprises in 20 provinces and regions in the 
central and western parts in the country reached RMB 400 billion 
last year, more than 60 percent up over the year before and 10 
percentage points higher than the country's growth on average. 
  Last year, the state made special loans of RMB 5 billion to 
support the development of township enterprises, seen as the 
biggest project for turning these areas from being poor into 
becoming rich. At the same time, various localities also 
increased their investment in this sector. Such investment for 
the development of these enterprises is predicted to account for 
RMB 35 billion, over 25 percent of the country's total, up from 
the 23 percent in the previous year. As a result, a large 
number of big-sized and highly efficient items have been set up. 
  According to initial statistics, such enterprises there have 
taken on 3.3 million rural redundant labourers, making up 60 
percent of the country's total new working force going into this 
sector last year. The gross output, business and sales income 
and profits tax earned by these enterprises last year amounted 
to 34.7 percent, 36.4 percent and 3.61 percent of the country's 
totals.

  [Text] From 4 to 7 January, the Propaganda Department of 
the CPC Central Committee and the State Press and Publications 
Administration [SPPA] jointly held a national forum in Nanning 
on the weekend pages of newspapers. The turnout was over 60, 
including Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Central Propaganda 
Department; Liang Heng, deputy director of the SPPA; Yang 
Jichang, standing committee member of the Guangxi regional CPC 
committee and head of the provincial propaganda department; and 
representatives from propaganda, press, and publication units 
and newspapers around the country. 
  Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Central Propaganda 
Department 
made an important speech on "highlighting the keynote without 
neglecting diversity, running weekend pages well, and bringing 
into full play of the role of weekend pages in the building of 
spiritual civilization." 
  He pointed out: A weekend page, as an extension of a 
newspaper proper, should consistently adhere to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the lodestar; adhere to the party's basic 
line of "one center, two basic points" and the spirit of the 
14th national party congress; adhere to the orientation of 
serving the people and socialism; adhere to the principle of 
"unity, stability, inspiring, and predominance of propaganda on 
positivity'; focus on cultivating and fostering lofty values in 
people and advocating correct ideas, beliefs, outlook on life, 
and values; and create a fine environment for reform, opening 
up, and socialist modernization in terms of media guidance and 
social mentality. Weekend pages should have differential and 
healthy styles and characteristics. Their contents should be of 
a refined taste, colorful, lively, and well accepted by the 
reader. It is necessary to highlight the keynote and make 
energetic efforts in propaganda on patriotic, collectivist, and 
socialist ideas; actively advocate a correct life outlook, 
values, and civilized lifestyle in the context of market 
economy; oppose money worship, out-and-out individualism, and 
decadent lifestyle; arouse enthusiasm for study and give full, 
effective play to the positive role of weekend pages in the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Gong Xinhan also pointed out in his speech the problems that 
had been observed in quite a few weekend pages for some time. 
He gave a careful analysis of the causes of those problems and 
demanded that substantial and effective measures be taken to 
change them. 
  He emphasized: The propaganda departments of party 
committees at various levels and the units in charge of 
newspapers with weekend pages should strengthen leadership and 
management. 
  Gong Xinhan also commented on the improvement of editorial 
personnel. 
  At the forum, the representatives spoke out freely, shared 
experiences in running weekend pages well, and explored ways to 
improve them. They agreed that they should make concerted 
efforts to upgrade weekend pages of their newspapers to a new 
standard. 
  Liang Heng, Yang Jichang, and Xu Xinhua, director of the 
Information Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, also 
spoke at the forum.

<F P=106> [XINHUA commentator's article: "Ensure Payment for </F>
Teachers' Overdue Salaries"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The new year has 
passed; however, in some localities teachers' overdue salaries 
have not been paid. The Spring Festival is approaching, but 
some teachers have not received payment for their work for the 
entire year. 
  The State Education Commission recently disclosed to the 
press that new progress has been made nationwide in paying the 
overdue salaries of primary and middle school teachers. 
However, ten provinces have made slow progress in this regard. 
  It goes without saying that delaying payment for teachers' 
salaries is not allowed. Teachers put in a lot of hard work to 
impart knowledge and educate people. Certainly they deserve 
payment according to their work. No matter what causes the 
delay, it is unbearable and unreasonable in terms of common 
sense and reason. Today, when we value education and respect 
teachers more and more, such absurd phenomenon must not occur. 
  In principle, the key to solving the problem lies in local 
governments, particularly major leaders. According to the 
regulations of China's "Compulsory Education Law," local party 
committees and governments entrusted with developing China's 
education are responsible for placing priority on developing 
education and on truly respecting teachers and valuing 
education; they also are responsible for taking resolute 
measures to ensure local input into education. Among these 
responsibilities is paying salaries to teachers in full and in a 
timely manner. 
  Governments at all levels should pay close attention to 
solving this payment arrears problem within a specified time. 
This is not only an issue of attitude, but also relates to 
China's educational development. Since the central authorities 
repeatedly lay injunctions on localities to solve the problem of 
teachers' overdue salaries, some localities have moved slowly or 
even made various excuses to postpone action. This is 
absolutely not allowed. 
  To strictly follow the arrangement made by the central 
authorities' relevant departments, to adopt feasible measures, 
and to ensure payment for teachers' overdue salaries by the 
Spring Festival so middle and primary school teachers can enjoy 
a happy Spring Festival -- these tasks should be handled 
thoroughly and importantly by party and government departments 
in those localities where teachers' overdue salaries have not 
been paid yet. 
  It is hoped payment for teachers' salaries will no longer be 
delayed.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday morning [5 January], provincial 
Governor Ma Zhongchen paid a visit to the teachers and students 
in Zhengzhou University and made a report on Henan's reform and 
development in 1994. In his report, Ma Zhongchen briefly talked 
about Henan's economic development in 1993 and gave a detailed 
description of the main objectives and reform policies for 1994. 
  Ma Zhongchen said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee set the objective of establishing a socialist 
market economy system in China. The establishment of this 
system makes new and increased demands on higher education. For 
some time to come, the central tasks of our province's higher 
education are to deepen the reform and to improve the quality of 
teaching and efficiency of operation. It is necessary to 
emancipate the mind, change the current state of closed 
operation, gradually open universities up, and achieve a higher 
gains-to-scale ratio. [passage omitted] 
  Ma Zhongchen called on party committees and governments at 
various levels to conscientiously act in accordance with the 
"Teachers' Law" and the "Program for the Reform and Development 
of Comprehensive Education," truly put education in a strategic 
position for priority development, and further foster a fine 
social atmosphere of respecting teachers and valuing education. 
  With regard to the problem of teachers' salary arrears in 
some places in the province, Ma Zhongchen demanded that the 
principal leaders of party committees and governments in those 
localities attend to this matter personally and adopt all 
necessary measures to ensure that teachers get their salary 
arrears before the Spring Festival, so that they can have a good 
holiday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the morning of 11 January, Acting Chairman 
Abulaidi Amurdurexiti presided over a coordination meeting on 
back pay owed by enterprises and establishments. At the 
meeting, it was decided that all outstanding pay for teachers 
and workers should be paid by the Spring Festival. 
  For historical and geographical reasons, economic 
development 
in our region has been rather uneven over the years, and some 
prefectures remain quite impoverished. This plus mismanagement 
and inefficiency of many enterprises have resulted in back pay 
in many localities. To solve this real difficulty for teachers 
and workers, the regional government convened a meeting of 
leading officials of the economic commission, banks, financial 
departments, labor departments, planning commissions, and 
education commissions to look into the situation of back pay and 
come up with a solution. 
  At the meeting, regional leaders Abulaidi Amurdurexiti, Wang 
Lequan, Wang Yousan, and (Ufuer Abudula) asked in great detail 
about the back pay situation in various sectors, offered their 
views on how to settle the problems, and criticized some 
departments for incompetence and mismanagement. 
  It was decided at the meeting that the regional treasury 
should come up with 200 million yuan to pay the arrears. 
Outstanding wages owed by enterprises should be paid with bank 
loans. All back pay for teachers and workers must be paid by 
the Spring Festival so they will be able to have a satisfying 
holiday.

<F P=106> [From the "Yunnan News" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned from the provincial Education 
Commission that as of the end of 1993 our province had settled 
the long-drawn-out problem of back pay for teachers. For years 
the provincial CPC committee and the government have 
conscientiously implemented the policy of making education the 
foundation and invigorating Yunnan through application of 
scientific and technological advances. Year after year, the 
province's treasury has set aside sufficient funds for teachers' 
pay and has steadily increased spending on education. However, 
from time to time last year, reports were heard that some 
localities diverted funds for teachers' pay to other projects, 
thereby being unable to pay wages on schedule or issuing IOUs in 
lieu of cash payments. 
  Upon learning of this situation, Governor He Zhiqiang 
specifically pointed out: No matter how tight our finances are, 
we must not let schools and teachers bear the brunt of the 
consequences. He instructed localities to take immediate action 
to settle back pay for teachers. Thanks to the efforts of 
authorities at all levels, outstanding pay for teachers has been 
all paid up. [video shows still photos of teachers and students

  [Text] Lhasa, January 12 (XINHUA) -- "Project Hope", which 
aims to help school dropouts in poverty-stricken areas to return 
to school, has received strong support from the Tibetan 
Government and people since it was launched here two years ago. 
  According to the Tibet Youth Development Foundation, in the 
past two years, over 300,000 people have contributed to the 
project, involving one-seventh of the region's total population. 
  By the end of last year, the foundation had raised a total 
of 
600,000 yuan (70,000 U.S. dollars), 200,000 yuan (23,000 U.S. 
dollars) more than in 1992. 
  Although the project started in Tibet Autonomous Region 
three 
years later than in other parts of China, it has made remarkable 
progress due to support from the local government and people. 
  "What we gain from `Project Hope' is more than just building 
some schools or helping a large number of school dropouts in 
Tibet return to school," said He Chongmin, secretary-general of 
the foundation. "More important, it has created an atmosphere in 
which every one pays attention to education." 
  In the summer of 1992, when the project started in Tibet, 
all 
the regional leaders attended a donation function to show their 
support. 
  Yangbai, a Tibetan retired road-mender who had been leading 
a 
frugal life, donated all the 7,000 yuan (800 U.S. dollars) she 
saved over the years when she heard of the project. 
  Doje, director of the Transportation Bureau in Xigaze, did 
not forget to donate 500 yuan (60 U.S. dollars) to the project 
when he was dying. 
  In addition, the project has received aid from other Chinese 
areas as well as overseas regions. 
  In 1992, Tibet signed an agreement with the China Youth 
Development Foundation, who pledged to help build at least two 
primary schools and offered 200,000 yuan (22,000 U.S. dollars) 
each year to the region. 
  A major corporation in Macao also donated 500,000 yuan 
(56,000 U.S. dollars) to the project in Tibet. 
  To properly use the money, Tibet has not copied other 
provinces in carrying out the project. Officials found that it 
is the huge area and limited number of schools that result in 
school dropouts. From some remote pasture areas, it takes three 
days on horseback to reach a school. 
  For education to penetrate into every corner of the broad 
plateau, the region has put its focus on building more schools, 
although this consumes more money and energy. 
  By 1995, the region will have set up 22 primary schools. 
  Meanwhile, the Tibet Youth Development Foundation is 
considering earmarking funds for those students in the interior 
areas who cannot afford to go to college. Scholarships are also 
expected to be established in newly-built primary schools to 
promote teaching quality. 
  So far, eight schools have been built up in Tibet, 
recruiting 
more than 1,000 school dropouts.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (CNS)--The correction of 
malpractices and the strengthening of discipline in the public 
health sector will be carried out this year. The Minister of 
Public Health, Mr. Chen Minzhang, said that the key work in this 
sector will lie in the prevention of accepting "red pockets" and 
commission while at the same time curbing charging at one's own 
will. 
  The correction of wrongdoing was put at the top of the 
agenda 
at the first national meeting held by the ministry this year. 
The goal set for this year is to achieve a confidence rate of 
90 percent by patients in terms of the treatment they receive in 
hospitals. The goal for satisfaction at the medical skill shown 
by medical personnel and the manner they render their services 
is set at 80 percent by patients while the rate of settling 
cases involved in malpractices is also set at 80 percent. 
  Mr. Chen stressed that hospitals of various kinds had to 
adopt effective measures this year to halt the paying and 
receiving of commission resulting from the transfer of patients 
to another hospital. Medical personnel found to have received 
commission for transferring patients to another hospital for 
treatment will be seriously dealt with. Administration of the 
financial system in a hospital must be put under strict control 
in a bid to ban the practice of receiving commission by medical 
personnel. 
  Mr. Chen added that regulations on the charging of fees had 
to be observed. Hospitals in various places which set up their 
own system of charging had to stop such practices at once while 
other hospitals which charge a fee higher than the stated 
standard fee had to correct their practice as soon as possible. 
Adjustment of charging of fees must follow certain procedures 
in accordance with stated regulations and approval by higher 
authorities is absolutely necessary. 
  Work on tackling the acceptance of "red pockets", commission 
and the practice of random charging proved a success to a 
certain extent last year. Public health bureaus in Beijing, 
Tianjin and Shanghai handed down disciplinary measures or 
economic punishment to nearly 300 persons guilty of the 
above-mentioned practices. 
  Incomplete statistics from 20 provinces show that cases 
involving random charging by various hospitals were put at 500 
and 170 of them whose fees were randomly charged were cancelled.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Mechanisms for </F>
the Old Guard To Get Involved in Politics Will Be Kept"] 
  [Text] Although Deng Xiaoping is still healthy and 
officials and Deng's children also continue to affirm Deng's 
normal health condition, the CPC top authorities are always 
worried about the variable of Deng's health. Recently, in order 
to prepare against possible trouble in the political situation 
after Deng's death, the CPC quietly made certain arrangements 
and adopted some measures. 
  One of the measures was to restore the mechanisms for the 
old 
guard to get involved in politics. 
  After the disbandment of the Central Advisory Commission, 
many old politicians became "jobless." However, some, holding a 
high position as "senior former leaders [yuan lao 0337 5071]" or 
being close to such high rank, continued to enjoy the right to 
keep their political influence. Some of them even kept their 
own offices. Four months ago, in late August 1993, the Political 
Bureau discussed whether to close the offices of Peng Zhen, Yang 
Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Song Ping. At that time, Peng Zhen, Yang 
Shangkun, and Wan Li expressed their support. Jiang Zemin also 
informally expressed his opinion through internal channels. 
Some people proposed that only the offices for Deng Xiaoping 
and Chen Yuan be maintained. However, no final decision was 
made on this issue, and the political participation of the old 
guard did not come to an end. When a final decision was to be 
made on the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, the Political Bureau still invited some 
retired old leaders to attend the relevant meeting and to 
participate in the decisionmaking. Song Ping, Song Renqiong, 
Yao Yilin and others still delivered seven proposals to the 
Political Bureau and the State Council in the name of their 
offices, including "A Six-Point Opinion on the Socialist Market 
Economy," "Problems Existing in the Current Economy," and 
"Central Authorities' Macrocontrol Is the Foundation for 
Ensuring the Healthy Development of the National Economy." At 
the memorial meeting to mourn the death of Zhou Peiyuan on 4 
December, the Yang Shangkun Office, the Bo Yibo Office, and the 
Song Ping Office presented wreaths. In late November, the Yang 
Dezhi Office, the Li Desheng Office, and the Zhang Aiping Office 
sent telegrams of congratulation to the units achieving 
outstanding results in the war exercises of the 2d Artillery 
Force. The Yao Yilin Office, the Song Renqiong Office, and the 
Gu Mu Office also dispatched investigation groups to Guangdong, 
Hainan, and Shanghai in late November to find out the reactions 
of the enterprises and institutions concerned to the reform 
resolution adopted by the Third Plenum of the Central Committee. 
  The offices of the old guard were not disbanded. 
  Now, a document has been issued, and the system of offices 
for the retired old leaders will be maintained. 
  On 6 December, the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the Central Military Commission jointly issued an important 
circular: According to the demand and proposal of most members 
and alternate members of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
other people attending the Third Plenary Session, and also 
according to the opinions the Central Committee solicited from 
the party organizations, the democratic parties, and the mass 
organizations, the older generation of leading comrades who 
enjoy high prestige inside and outside the party and who are 
esteemed and admired by the people should continue to be able to 
participate in the formulation of major policy decisions and 
guidelines and to play a certain guiding and assistant role in 
the handling of important affairs, as they have accumulated 
valuable work experience in the years of revolutionary wars and 
socialist construction, although they have retired or left the 
party, government, and military leading bodies. In the 
discussions of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and 
the Central Military Commission, people unanimously proposed 
that the work bodies, namely, the offices, of the older 
generation of the party, government, and military leaders be 
maintained. The document has been issued to all central party, 
government, and military organs and to the party committees of 
all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, military 
regions, and military branches. 
  The decision on keeping the offices of some old former 
leaders of course reaffirmed the maintenance of their political 
privilege. Reportedly, the offices of Peng Zhen, Yang Shangkun, 
Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, Yang 
Dezhi, Li Desheng, Zhang Aiping, Gu Mu, and Yu Qiuli were 
maintained. 
  It was said that the proposal on maintaining the office 
system for the retired old leaders was jointly put forth by Qiao 
Shi and Hu Jintao, members of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau, and Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin, 
members of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. At the 
group meetings of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, Guangdong's Xie Fei, Shanghai's Wu Bangguo, 
Shandong's Jiang Chunyun, and some members and alternate members 
of the Central Committee from Sichuan, Liaoning, Hubei, 
Zhejiang, and Hebei also raised similar proposals. When 
attending the group meetings, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi 
indicated that the Political Bureau was considering the issue of 
maintaining the offices for some retired old leaders. 
  On another occasion, Li Peng said that the party Central 
Committee and the State Council continued to consult the 
comrades of the older generation on some major affairs of the 
party and the state and on the making of relevant policies and 
decisions. It was necessary to maintain the work organs for them. 
  On 15 November, at a discussion meeting with some 
responsible 
people of the democratic parties, Jiang Zemin said: The 
Political Bureau will propose that retired party and government 
leaders at the central and provincial levels may maintain their 
work organs so that they may continue to participate in the 
making of major policy decisions. However, this should be 
approved by the Political Bureau and the Central Secretariat. 
  Reportedly, the offices for retired old leaders will be 
subordinate to the Central Secretariat in the future rather than 
to the Political Bureau. This indicates that they will be 
"downgraded" in the hierarchy of power. 
  An informed old cadre revealed privately that the 
continuation of the office system for the old guard was the 
product of a compromise between Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun. The 
purpose of keeping this system was to appease the old cadres, 
but more importantly, it may enable the old guard to help 
control the situation once Deng Xiaoping dies. Chen Yun's 
faction had another purpose. That is, it would enable it to 
bolster the Jiang-Li leadership structure and also control its 
orientation in order to prevent it from "drifting westward" 
(adopting capitalism across the board) and to maintain its 
socialist orientation. The purpose of Deng Xiaoping's faction 
was to reinforce the momentum of reform and preserve its own 
interests. Moreover, it wants to obtain greater decisionmaking 
power with the support of the military after Deng's death, and 
prevent the Jiang-Li structure from monopolizing power inside 
the party. 
  The office system for the senior retired leaders is in fact 
a 
small-sized advisory committee. This part of the old guard is 
certainly satisfied with such an arrangement. However, most 
retired cadres are frustrated. Many of them are getting 
increasingly depressed and dejected, and some have even 
degenerated. Generally, they have lost interest in politics and 
do not maintain the party spirit. Some senior retired leaders 
are trying to spur these comrades on. 
  Since early December, the proposal of Peng Zhen and Yang 
Shangkun on "five shoulds and five should-nots" has been relayed 
to retired cadres at the ministerial and provincial level, and 
the retired cadres were asked to exercise self-discipline. 
  In early November, at an inner-party meeting with some 
retired old cadres, Yang Shangkun first proposed "four shoulds 
and four should-nots": 1) They should keep pace with the party 
Central Committee, and should not lag behind the situation; 2) 
they should take the initiative in safeguarding the party's 
leadership, and should not place themselves above the party; 3) 
they should conscientiously study and understand Comrade 
Xiaoping's theory, and should not conservatively stick to 
conventions and refuse to make new progress; and 4) they should 
continue to do something beneficial to the party's central task 
in their late years, and should not rest on their laurels. 
  Peng Zhen added one point: They should take responsibility 
for educating their families and children and persuading them to 
be the people's public servants rather than doing corrupt and 
discipline- violating things. 
  Recently, in a document about the activities of party 
organizations, Peng Zhen wrote an instruction: "Old comrades do 
not have the privilege of not abiding by the party's discipline 
and not obeying the party. They should regularly take part in 
the activities of party organizations, take part in political 
studies, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only those 
who are weak and sick can be exceptions." 
  The "five shoulds and five should-nots" proposed by Yang and 
Peng and Peng's recent instruction were aimed at the current 
problems. According to the General Office of the CPC Central 
Committee, only less than 40 percent of retired old cadres still 
continue to regularly take part in the activities of party 
organizations and take part in political studies. About 30 
percent of retired old cadres in the central organs have not 
taken part in any activities of party organizations for from 
over six months to one year for reasons of health. More than 
half the former Central Advisory Commission members are often 
absent from party activities. However, the retired old cadres 
borrow meeting places to hold their gatherings more frequently 
than when they were still in office. 
  In addition, only 20 percent of retired old cadres at the 
provincial level still regularly take part in party activities, 
and over 60 percent of the retired old cadres often ask for 
leave. 
  Various signs show that the CPC has lost its vigor, and is 
getting looser. Communist ideals and beliefs have collapsed in 
the minds of most party members. In place of such ideals and 
beliefs, they have adopted individualism, hedonism, liberalism, 
and other noncommunist ideologies. With the lack of checks and 
balances from other political forces, it is inevitable that the 
party will become increasingly corrupt. The economic reform 
initiated by Deng Xiaoping will only alleviate the symptoms of 
the illness and will not be able to effect a permanent cure. 
Once Deng dies, the CPC will face its death if it fails to 
effect self-transformation.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Jianhua (7120 1696 5478) of the Chinese </F>
Academy of Social Sciences: "Five Major Factors Affecting 
Chinese Society in 1994"] 
  [Text] People are following with interest the trend of the 
social situation in China in 1994. 
  Through a series of emergency intervention measures, 
including the macroeconomic regulation and control, the 
anticorruption struggle, the crackdown on criminals, and others, 
which were adopted in 1993, the central government has 
maintained social stability and economic growth. However, a 
number of internal structural contradictions and problems have 
not yet been resolved. As a result, many factors affecting 
social stability, such as overly rapid price rises and so on, 
were ready to create trouble at the end of 1993. What is more, 
due to the central government's repeatedly emphasizing that 1994 
will be a crucial year for the "rapid advance of groups [ji tuan 
tu jin 7162 0957 4499 6651]" carrying out reform, the possible 
trend of the social situation in 1994 has attracted greater 
attention from people and has looked somewhat complicated and 
confusing. 
  Although many factors affecting the trend of the social 
situation in 1994 are full of contingencies and uncertainties, 
the five major factors of reform, economic construction, the 
political situation, the public will, and the central 
government's authority are the most crucial ones, and are 
forecastable as well as understandable. 
  1. The acceleration of the reform process in 1994 will 
provide a further motive force for social and economic 
development, but reform will also produce a complicated impact 
on the trend of the social situation. The institution of a 
modern enterprise system and the structural reforms in prices, 
finance, taxation, investment, etc. will be the focal points of 
the "rapid advance of groups" next [as published] year. Their 
direct goal is to achieve the best allocation of natural 
resources in society. At the beginning of their being put into 
practice, however, they will bring about a series of social and 
economic consequences, some of which will emerge on the negative 
side. This raises the question -- discussed over the past 15 
years but which has gained little attention in practice -- of 
the coordination [pei tao xing 6792 1152 1840] of reform. 
  The reform of the modern enterprise system absolutely does 
not just involve the relationship between government 
administration and enterprises, the tax system, and the market, 
but it also involves such systems as labor and personnel, social 
insurance, trade unions, workers' representative conferences, as 
well as more sensitive social political relationships, social 
organizational relationships, and relevant value criteria. In 
this regard, we must make adequate forecasts and take 
corresponding technical countermeasures. 
  Reform in such areas as commodity prices and taxation will 
exert strong pressure on people's tolerance when it touches the 
level of their daily lives. A new characteristic of changes 
revealed in people's tolerance has surfaced, that is, it is very 
difficult for people to consider increased income a guaranteed 
factor for the strengthening of tolerance. Many signs indicate 
that the general mood of the people in 1994 and the changes in 
their tolerance will be affected by social and economic factors, 
which are far more complicated than price rises, and the degree 
of their unpredictability is increasing. 
  There are other meanings in the reform factors affecting the 
situation in society in 1994, among which the following two 
points are most important: 1) Will the political structural 
reform be suited to the economic structural reform? The 
economic structural reform has involved a rather deep-going 
level (such as the modern enterprise system, the market, and 
enterprise ownership and management). If the political reform 
remains only in the area of administrative structure in a 
general sense, it will entail two consequences -- reform will 
yield very few results (say, in solving the problem of 
overstaffing in organs); and the economic structural reform once 
again will be held back (as certain reform measures will lose 
shape because their practice is not guaranteed by necessary 
political mechanisms). 2) The political reform process with no 
reversal is a significant factor that will affect the trend of 
the social situation in 1994. Reform in the last 15 years has 
brought tremendous changes in the social economic foundation and 
structures, so a reversal would cause a loss of social economic 
vitality and confusion in people's minds. 
  2. Economic construction will enter a crucial year in 1994. 
Although the rapid growth that has continued for two years has 
brought vigor and vitality to the entire society, it has still 
been followed by a certain degree of confusion, disorder, and 
shortage of supplies. Optimizing structure and enhancing 
economic results should be the main theme of the economic 
construction in 1994. This is a correct implication. The 
practice of blindly pursuing high speed in disregard of a sound 
foundation will certainly lead to great ups and downs in the 
economy. The introduction of various economic structural reform 
plans in 1994 is a direct effort toward a healthy economy. 
Economic fluctuation will be a factor posing a direct threat to 
social stability. The prevention of great ups and downs in 
economic construction depends, to a considerable extent, on the 
appropriateness of macroeconomic policy decisions and the 
faithful performance of their duties by middle-level executive 
departments. 
  Judging from the changes in the economic situation in the 
first and second halves of 1993, it was not purely an act of 
economic policy decisionmaking to put on the brakes (either for 
a soft landing or a hard landing). It had noticeable political 
implications, including the efforts made by the central 
government to stabilize the overall situation and to politically 
negate the orientation of expansion in localities. The problem 
was that various social, economic, and political mechanisms that 
led to the overheated economy were not removed, given the 
initial results scored by the macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1993. This means that the social causes of the 
economic fluctuations will not be completely eliminated in 1994. 
This year, they probably will not manifest themselves in the 
form of expanded investment in localities, but in the form of 
"revising" a series of economic policies set by the central 
government. The economic fluctuations brought about by this 
will certainly lead to chaotic economic and even social order, 
so that the public feeling of life being unstable will be 
sharpened. 
  3. The authority of the central government will face 
multiple trials in 1994. Apart from the above-mentioned ability 
to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, there are 
still two extremely crucial issues, as follows: 
  First, whether or not the anticorruption struggle will 
achieve actual results will have a bearing on maintaining the 
public will and establishing the authority of the central 
government. As a result of the mass mobilization through public 
opinion and the initial actions taken in the second half of 
1993, the anticorruption struggle has become an extremely 
sensitive focal point in society. Although the struggle was 
confronted with various difficult choices from the very outset, 
it enjoyed popular confidence once it gathered momentum and 
yielded actual results. This has covered two aspects -- whether 
the anticorruption struggle can be waged at the upper levels, 
and whether it can be conducted in localities. The progress of 
the struggle in various localities has been uneven, which is a 
fact universally acknowledged. It is anticipated that there 
will be little possibility of social unrest in 1994, which is 
directly affected by factors of the anticorruption struggle. 
However, various kinds of friction and conflicts triggered by 
the declining authority of the central government will be a 
hidden peril affecting social stability. 
  Second, practicing a revenue-sharing system is a mission of 
priority in 1994. As viewed from the angle of intensifying the 
central government's ability and authority to absorb revenue, 
the said system should be put into practice, even though 
technical conditions have not entirely matured yet. As this 
system directly involves the redistribution of economic 
interests between the central government and localities, the 
partial interests of those localities with powerful economic 
strength will be lost temporarily, and whether they will accept 
such losses remains a question. In order to implement the above 
system smoothly, the central government should make adequate 
forecasts of various possible consequences (including the 
resurgence of local chauvinism, the intensification of local 
interests, tax pressures imposed by upper levels, and so on). 
On this issue, administrative, legal, and economic means should 
be employed simultaneously. At the present stage, however, only 
administrative means are the most perfect for contacts between 
the central and local authorities. This determines that 
stepping up administrative intervention sometimes cannot be 
avoided, which will bring forth a series of frictions and 
conflicts in the social, economic, and political areas. We 
should also note that the authority of the central government 
involves not only the issue of economic interest distribution 
with localities, but also a large number of social and political 
issues. For example, the central government will face the 
question of maintaining and strengthening this authority in the 
areas of investment policy, public security policy, the 
establishment of a unified market system, and so on. 
  4. Public will and opinion will become another major factor 
affecting the social situation in 1994. Since reform began 15 
years ago, people from various quarters have come to understand, 
given support to, and participated in reform with 
unprecedentedly great enthusiasm. They have benefited a good 
deal from the reform achievements, as their personal development 
opportunities have been substantially increased, their fields of 
mental activities have been considerably broadened, and their 
means of entertainment and consumption have become diversified. 
In the meantime, people's tolerance has withstood continuous 
trials, heavier pressure has been added to their lives, and 
their sense of security has tended to decline. 
  In recent years, people have acquired a much more distinct 
concept of interests and have had clearer feelings toward 
interest gains and losses. If reform and economic construction 
exert excessively heavy pressure -- in commodity prices in 
particular -- on people's daily lives in 1994, then the 
awareness of interest losses caused to some strata will be 
sharpened. In 1993, peasants' income grew slowly, the income of 
staff and workers was unsecured owing to the poor performance of 
enterprises, the living standard of retired people declined, and 
the reversed position of mental and physical laborers was not 
set right. All this has added weight to the pressures of living 
of considerable numbers of people, which increases the 
possibility of their unexpected response to particular specific 
economic policies. 
  Another major characteristic of the changes in people's 
wills 
and opinions in 1994 is their concern for social affairs. For 
example, their expectations of the anticorruption struggle will 
directly affect their confidence in the justice of society and 
in the central government. In rural areas, the relationship 
between cadres and masses has been somewhat tense as a result of 
the disputes over peasants' burdens and other economic affairs. 
In urban enterprises, there have been contradictions centering 
around such issues as income, democratic management, and so on 
between managers and staff and workers. Along with the practice 
of the modern enterprise system in 1994, there will be new forms 
of expression for these contradictions. A host of facts have 
indicated that the work style of grass-roots cadres is at the 
core of the tension between cadres and staff and workers, and 
that its adverse impact on the people's will and opinion is no 
better than that of the spread of corrupt phenomena. 
  5. The stable political situation was the foundation for 
stabilizing the overall social situation in 1993. 
  In 1994, the transfer of central power (i.e. from the second 
generation of the leading collective to the third generation of 
the leading collective) will enter a crucial period. Focused on 
defining the policies of reform, economic construction, and 
domestic and foreign affairs, this transfer has started to carry 
substantive content. History proves that in the variable of the 
political pattern in contemporary China, the issue of unity 
during the period of transference of power is the most difficult 
to tackle. Once an obstacle to unity arises, it will elicit 
massive personnel changes or even policy reversals, thus leading 
to turbulence in the social situation. During this year, a 
number of vital social interest relations are urgently awaiting 
a solution and, without a united and rational central 
government, it is impossible to fulfill the above missions. In 
particular, under the situation that the functional 
transformation of the central government and its subordinates, 
the manifestation of authority, and the ability to exercise 
regulation and control are confronted with many difficulties, 
inappropriateness in the course of transference of power will 
lead to disastrous consequences. At the present stage, the 
establishment of checking and balancing and compromise 
mechanisms of power within the central government is the only 
choice to maintain its unity and rationality. 
  Under the condition of China's social structure at the 
present stage, the stability of the political situation is of 
particularly vital importance. However, a protracted and 
institutionalized stability must rely on a more flexible form of 
control in society, which can effectively mediate various acute 
social contradictions and remove factors for potential social 
conflict in a timely manner. Of course, a relatively long 
process is necessary for the establishment of this new form of 
control, but, if the first step is made in the area of 
transference of power during the crucial period, many costs can 
be avoided and the extent of social turbulence can be reduced. 
As far as 1994 is concerned, it is a historic opportunity to 
make decisions.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] While the apparatchiks are climbing up the 
political ladder and the red capitalists are making money, quite 
a number of China's intellectuals are suffocating in ennui. 
  Take a look at the just-published Elite magazine, one of the 
handful of cultural products churned out since mid-1989 by some 
of the nation's best -- and most open-minded -- brains. 
  Founders of, and contributors to the journal include such 
big 
names as former People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] editor Qin Chuan; 
former culture minister Wang Meng; avant-garde economists Yu 
Guangyuan and Wu Jinglian; liberal elders Li Rui and Xia Yan; 
and taboo-smashing writers Shao Yanxiang and Zhang Kangkang. 
  The founders waged a fruitless battle for nearly a year to 
secure for Elite, which is intended as an unofficial, general 
interest journal, a publication licence and a shuhao (book or 
periodical number). The problem was partly solved when the 
magazine became a semi- dependent entity under the China 
Strategic and Management Research Society, a quasi-official unit 
in which Mr Qin's son is a senior staffer. Elite was granted a 
temporary shuhao. The censors indicated proper registration 
would only be considered after a few trial issues. The 3,000 
copies of the inaugural issue, however, could not be circulated 
nationwide through the regular distribution network. Most ended 
up being handed out by the editors as gifts to fellow 
intellectuals. This is despite the inordinate precautions taken 
not to run foul of the remnant Maoists running the Propaganda 
Department and assorted units. The first page of Elite carries 
a giant photograph of Deng Xiaoping. 
  In an inaugural message, Mr Qin cites the patriarch's name 
four times saying Elite "is willing to make propaganda for Deng 
Thought." And while a few of the articles in the first issue 
touched on hot issues such as privatisation and the assessment 
of Chairman Mao, none was deemed controversial or provocative. 
  While, on the economic arena, the Chinese Communist Party 
seems to be liberalising on all fronts, in the cultural field it 
is very much a case of making a hundred flowers wilt. 
  For fear of rocking the boat in the uncertain period before 
patriarch Deng Xiaoping's final departure from the scene, the 
Propaganda Department and its ideological police are taking no 
chances. Since mid-1993, the department has practically stopped 
giving permits for new newspapers, periodicals and publishing 
houses. Worst hit are bourgeois-liberal intellectuals who often 
are unable to have their works published--despite there having 
been no regulation barring them from appearing in print. 
  For some strange reason, the Beijing Yanshan Publishing 
House 
recently held up the distribution of its series of books 
entitled Life after 60. What apparently went awry was that two 
volumes of the autobiographical pieces contain retrospectives 
penned by liberal authors Wang Ruoshui and Hu Jiwei, both former 
journalists with the People's Daily. 
  The editor of the series, Zhou Airuo, the son of Marxist 
scholar Zhou Yang, has reportedly parted ways with the 
publisher. Late last year, the authorities also put pressure on 
an American foundation to withdraw financial support from a team 
led by Beijing University legal scholar Gong Xiangrui. 
Professor Gong has been trying to put out a series of 
monographs on the constitutional history of Asian countries, 
including China. 
  For a brief period last summer intellectuals in Beijing were 
pinning their hopes on the "new blood" from Shanghai that 
President Jiang Zemin had transferred to Beijing. These 
Shanghai faction affiliates include the vice-chief editor of 
People's Daily, Zhou Ruijin, the vice-chief of propaganda, Gong 
Xinhan, and the vice- chief of the Theoretical Bureau of the 
Propaganda Department, Li Junru. 
  Mr Zhou, a former editor with Shanghai's Liberation Daily, 
helped draft the series of articles of radical reform that 
appeared in early 1991 under the pen-name of Huang Puping, a 
shorthand for "Deng Xiaoping speaking out at Huangpu River (in 
Shanghai)". 
  Since his migration to Beijing however, Mr Zhou's more 
liberal colleagues have complained about his timidity. One 
story doing the rounds of the party mouthpiece said Mr Zhou 
consulted the Propaganda Department on whether to include the 
name of the editor of a volume that was featured in the Daily's 
book news column. 
  The tome in question, Changing Our Brains -- which is based 
on a 1992 slogan attributed to Mr Deng is edited by liberal 
elder Yu Guangyuan. The transfer of Mr Gong and Mr Li to the 
Propaganda Department was at first interpreted as an attempt to 
neutralise the influence of veteran Maoists such as the 
executive vicechief of Propaganda, Xu Weicheng. 
  Both Shanghai faction stalwarts however, have adopted the 
lowest of profiles. Mr Li has reportedly not even begun a 
regular work shift at the department. 
  Mr Xu, who is supposed to have retired last year, is very 
much in charge. He, together with the relatively conservative 
head of the department, Ding Guangen, is expected to call a 
national conference on propaganda later this month to impose an 
even harsher straitjacket on media and cultural units. 
  Since late 1993, Mr Ding, who used to play bridge with 
patriarch Deng, has ordered the People's Daily to fax him the 
proofs of its major editorial pages every night. And Mr Xu and 
his like-minded commissars have lately begun a virtual purge of 
the Hong Kong contents of the electronic media. 
  In a talk to staff of the Ministry of Radio, Film and 
Television, Mr Xu, once a protege of Madame Jiang Qing, 
indicated state television and radio stations should largely 
weed out songs and videos by or featuring Hong Kong and Taiwan 
artists. 
  When asked what they should play instead, the ideologue 
said: 
"The 100 patriotic movies or their theme songs," which are being 
featured on television and broadcasts. Mr Xu was referring to 
the 100 mostly old films the Propaganda Department had selected 
for their "patriotic and socialist" orientation. 
  While disparaging Hong Kong cultural products for their 
"bourgeois-liberal propensities", the propaganda machinery has 
also run a campaign of innuendo on how Hong Kong and Taiwan 
singers and movie stars have allegedly evaded taxes. 
  Under the guise of reviving patriotic education and 
remembering Chairman Mao, the Propaganda Department has 
reinstated a large number of products of the Cultural 
Revolution, including "model revolutionary" operas and songs 
favoured by the Gang of Four.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Do More Practical Things and Speak </F>
Less Empty Words--Third Discussion on Having a New Work Style in 
the New Year"] 
  [Text] Do more practical things and speak less empty words 
-- this is another important content of Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
emphasis on improving the work style of the leadership. We have 
talked about the need to learn more and do more research and 
investigations in the last two commentaries. What was the 
purpose? It is for doing practical things and doing a good job 
in reform, opening up, and the various undertakings of socialist 
modernization. 
  The advocacy of doing more practical things and speaking 
less 
empty words is to ask cadres of various levels to play an 
exemplary role in leading the broad masses to do real and solid 
work; make solid contributions to promoting reform, opening up, 
and modernization construction; and prevent and overcome bad 
work styles such as exaggeration, lip service, formalism, and 
fancy appearances. The magnificent mansion of socialist 
modernization is built by bricks and stones, not blown up by 
empty puffs. Empty talk ruins the country, solid work 
invigorates it, and many such examples can be found in history. 
It should be affirmed that a great majority of our leading 
cadres work diligently, conscientiously, and practically and 
this is the important reason for the prosperous development of 
our undertakings. However, we must also realize that among a 
small number of comrades some bad work styles exist. They fall 
to the sea of meetings and the mountain of documents, make vague 
calls without giving concrete guidance, and work superficially; 
or they part with reality, give promises lightly, and do not 
grasp implementation; or they try to have their "names in 
newspapers, sounds in broadcasts, and images on television," but 
are not willing to do solid work; or they watch the upper levels 
and engage in some fancy appearances which win praise from their 
superiors.... These bad work styles seriously part from the 
masses, hinder the implementation of the party's principles, 
policies, and decisions, and must be resolutely overcome. Of 
course, when we oppose empty talk, we are only getting at the 
phenomenon of not doing practical things, we are not saying that 
we do not have to honestly publicize development goals which we 
can reach, nor are we saying that we do not have to speak some 
words to encourage the masses to unite for the struggle. The 
actual work is complicated, and regarding which things we should 
explain first and do later, which things we should explain and 
do simultaneously, and which things we should do first and 
explain later, we must analyze and handle them from the 
viewpoint of concrete conditions. 
  What is the biggest practical thing which we should do well 
with all our energy at this time? It is expediting reform and 
development. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee has drawn a blueprint for building 
our socialist market economy system. This year, based on the 
spirit of the "decision," the central leadership has been 
announcing measures to reform taxation, finance, foreign trade, 
investment, and planning, and various localities have been 
actively implementing them. In the progress of reform and 
development, we will surely run into new conflicts and problems, 
which require our cadres of various levels to rack their brains 
to solve them one by one in a practical manner to enable the 
central leadership's measures for expediting reform and 
development to be implemented one by one. Various localities 
differ in conditions, and, as they propose goals and formulate 
measures, they must consider their own actual conditions and 
refrain from blind comparisons. They must be ambitious on the 
one hand and work solidly on the other hand. When various 
localities and departments find themselves upholding this 
principle and properly, solidly, and fruitfully do a good job in 
the reform, development, and modernization of their own places, 
they have developed a good work style of doing more practical 
things and speaking less empty words. 
  In the process of doing practical things, we must correctly 
understand and handle the relationship between doing practical 
things and demonstrating the merit of work. When more practical 
things are done and done better, the merit of work becomes 
prominent, and officials can win the support of the masses and 
praise from their superiors. There is no question about this. 
Some comrades set the goal that "when one takes the office of 
governor of a locality, one must benefit the locality in which 
he serves." This kind of ambition is worth encouraging. But we 
must also prevent and overcome short-term behavior, that is, one 
may be willing to do practical things which can easily 
demonstrate one's work merits instantly, but he may be unwilling 
to do practical things which cannot easily demonstrate his work 
merits instantly but which indeed have to been done from a 
long-term perspective. Much short-term behavior has brought 
about many adverse effects to the extent of hindering the pace 
of reform and development, and this has been proved by much 
practice. The purpose of doing more practical things is to 
benefit the country and the people, not to establish tablets or 
create legends for oneself. It is hoped that this starting 
point issue will draw the attention of leading comrades of 
various levels. 
  Showing concern for the sufferings of the masses and 
solving their difficulties is a practical thing which ought to 
be done by the leaders of various levels. The purpose of our 
party is to serve the people heart and soul, and the purpose of 
reform and development is to let the people have a happier life. 
Speaking frankly, the adjustment of the pattern of interests 
and relationships during the deepening of reform will benefit 
the broad masses of the people. But at a certain stage and in a 
certain area, different masses will be benefited differently. 
This is unavoidable. Under this condition, leaders of various 
levels must always be concerned with the well-being of the broad 
masses, promptly discover problems, and make prompt adjustments 
to solve problems. Only by so doing can they protect enthusiasm 
among the masses, mobilize them as much as possible to 
participate in the reform and to support it and create a stable 
social and political environment for reform and development. 
  To do more practical things, we must develop the spirit of 
hard struggle and a scientific and pragmatic spirit as well. 
Hard struggle is a precious tradition of ours. Today, while we 
do pioneering work in reform and opening up, the effect will be 
very different if we do not have a spirit of hard struggle. We 
must closely rely on the broad masses of cadres and people, do 
more practical things which require less money or do not even 
require money, and do less things which increase burdens on the 
masses and require compulsory appropriations. Due to limited 
financial strength, there are some things which we cannot do at 
this time, but we must patiently explain to the masses to win 
their understanding. To do practical things, we must also seek 
truth from facts and cherish scientific attitude. We must never 
do things by relying only on enthusiasm or subjective wishes. 
We must carry out scientific discussions and make scientific 
decisions on the basis of research and investigation. We must 
try hard to reduce minor errors while avoiding big ones and 
enable every practical thing to obtain the biggest economic and 
social returns. 
  Since reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
stressed that leading cadres should have a good work style. 
Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly asked leading 
cadres of various levels to learn more, have less social 
intercourse, do more research and investigations, have less 
subjectivism, and do more practical things and speak less empty 
words. These three requirements are the most important contents 
of improving the work style of the leadership. A new year has 
just begun, and I hope that leading comrades of various levels 
develop the good work style of learning more, doing more 
research and investigations, and doing more practical things; 
better unite with the broad masses of people and lead them in 
clearing a way to forge ahead; and work diligently to enable our 
reform, opening up, and modernization undertakings to proceed 
faster and better in order to please the whole party and the 
people of the whole country.

  [Text] Hohhot, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Children of minority 
nationalities in China now have more books to read, thanks to 
efforts by writers and publishers devoted to ethnic-minority 
children's literature. 
  Actively involved in producing such works on the subject are 
not only writers from minority nationalities, but also those of 
Han nationality. 
  China has 55 minority nationalities, who have developed 
colorful literatures in the process of their historical 
development. 
  These works, covering anecdotes, fairy tales, fables and 
poems, are rich in content and of high artistic value. They are 
a precious part of the world's literary heritage. 
  Over the past few years great efforts have been made to 
boost 
the output of literature for children of minority nationalities. 
  A number of books, such as "Selected Stories for Chinese 
Children of Minority Nationalities", "Selected Stories for 
Minority Nationalities in South and North China" and "Folk Tales 
of Chinese Minority Nationalities", have been published. Some 
of them have been translated into foreign languages and been 
carried by foreign magazines. 
  "The Story of a Living Buddha", written by Malchinfu, a 
famous Mongolian writer, has been highly praised by readers for 
its vivid description of the life of a Mongolian child who 
started life as a living Buddha and then became a doctor. 
  In 1987, China's first nationalities publishing house was 
built in Inner Mongolia. It has published thousands of books in 
the Mongolian language, including some world classics, such as 
"Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales". 
  Other such publishing houses have emerged in many 
ethnic-minority areas, from the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet 
Autonomous Regions in the west to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous 
Prefecture in northeast China's Jilin Province.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
wildlife official today denied overseas reports that bears in 
captivity in China are tortured. 
  Vice-minister of Forestry Shen Maocheng said that reports of 
torture of bears on a farm in south China's Guangdong Province 
are partly false and partly rumors. 
  According to propaganda by an animal welfare fund in Britain 
and reports by German media, bears on Nanping Bear Farm in 
Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, Guangdong Province, were not only 
used to produce bile which was siphoned through a tube from the 
liver, but also were killed to make food or soup, said the 
minister. 
  The reports also estimated that 8,000 bears in China were 
tortured in that way everyday and China planned to use 40,000 
bears for bile production, Shen said. 
  The minister told XINHUA that there are about 5,000 bears in 
captivity in China for bile production and China will not 
increase the number, since the bile output is enough for 
traditional Chinese medicine production. 
  Shen added that "there is indeed a bear with only three paws 
on the farm, but the lost paw was not cut away by the farm 
owner." 
  He added that the three-pawed bear was picked up from the 
wild and raised by the owner. 
  Investigations show that the farm was set up without 
official 
permission and the illegal farm has been closed, he said. 
  Under an official regulation issued in 1991 on bear raising, 
training and breeding, farms without adequate techniques or 
facilities are not allowed to raise bears. 
  "It is unreasonable and extremely unfair to ignore China's 
great efforts to preserve wildlife and its substantial progress 
by using a single example." 
  He admitted that some bear farms, which had been run without 
official permission and were poorly equipped, were shut down 
last year, indicating that basic requirements for operation 
include adequate technology and facilities. 
  "Since the existing authorized farms produce enough bile, no 
new farm will be allowed to be set up," Shen said. 
  He said that China cannot agree with the one-sided view by 
some pure conservationists in the world which emphasizes 
preservation and opposes any kind of use of animals. 
  "In that case, all the scientific experiments and research 
which use animals should not be carried out. Human beings can 
not use horses and oxen to work and can no longer eat chickens 
and mutton," the minister said. 
  He added that "China puts preservation and protection of 
bear 
resources first and use of bears second." 
  According to official estimates, there are tens of thousands 
of wild bears in China. 
  "China made great achievements in protecting and preserving 
endangered wildlife in the past decade and will continue to do 
so," Shen said. "We welcome well-meaning advice and aid given by 
all the other countries in the world to join in the effort to 
preserve wildlife."

  [Text] Paris, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Franco-Chinese ties 
are now "totally normalized," French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe said here today after the two governments issued a joint 
communique. 
  France and China have resumed "relations of trust," Juppe 
told reporters. 
  According to the joint communique, the Chinese side has 
reaffirmed its consistent principled position on the question of 
Taiwan, while the French side has confirmed that the French 
Government recognizes the government of the People's Republic of 
China as the sole legal government of China and Taiwan as an 
integral part of Chinese territory. 
  The communique says French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
will pay an official visit to China in the near future. 
  Juppe said the visit will take place "in a few weeks, 
perhaps 
in March," when the Daya Bay Nuclear Center in the southern 
Chinese province of Guangdong, which was built with help from 
France, is inaugurated. 
  Sources close to Balladur said that former French Minister 
Alain Peyrefitte will visit Beijing soon to attend ceremonies on 
January 27 for the 30th anniversary of the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between France and China. 
  The French prime minister has asked Peyrefitte to prepare 
"very attentively" for his China trip, the sources said.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Jiangsu, one of 
China's most economically developed provinces, has approved more 
than 20,000 overseas-funded enterprises, ranking second in 
China, after Guangdong Province. 
  This shows that the focus of foreign investment is moving 
from the Pearl River delta in south China to the Chang Jiang 
river delta, economists said. 
  In 1993, the local government approved a total of 10,248 
overseas-funded enterprises, involving 10.8 billion U.S. dollars 
in contracted foreign funds, of which 2.84 billion U.S. dollars 
have been put to use. 
  By the end of last year, the province had approved 20,354 
foreign funded enterprises. Of these, 6,800 enterprises have 
been operational. 
  Economists attributed the trend to the implementation of 
China's strategy of opening up and developing the Chang Jiang 
river delta and the economic belt along the Chang Jiang river in 
1991. 
  Jiangsu is situated where the Chang Jiang river and the East 
[China] Sea meet. It has several major ports, including 
Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Zhangjiagang, Nantong and Lianyungang. 
  In 1993, it stepped up the construction of energy, transport 
and telecommunications facilities and has greatly improved the 
investment environment. 
  It has also strengthened drafting of regulations to attract 
overseas investment. 
  Good performances among overseas-funded enterprises have 
bolstered the confidence of overseas investors in the province, 
provincial officials said. 
  A survey of 2,010 foreign-funded enterprises conducted by 
the 
provincial department of finance during January and September 
last year showed that they had a total output value of 16.8 
billion yuan and reported a sales income of 14.2 billion yuan, 
respectively up 64 percent and 62 percent over the previous 
year. They produced 982 million yuan in profits, up 92 percent. 
  The still greater investment tide has not come yet, Vice 
Provincial Governor Wang Rongbin said. 
  He estimated that the paid-in foreign funds for this year 
will grow by 50 percent over last year.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Comrade Xie Fei (6200 7236), </F>
Guangdong CPC secretary, at Second Plenary Session of Seventh 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee on 9 December 1993; place not 
given: "Quicken the Pace of Reform, Promote Modernization"] 
  [Text] The main task of this current session is to: 
Convey and study the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; study how to implement the "Decision 
By the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions Concerning the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" in the 
light of Guangdong's actual conditions; speed up the pace of 
reform; and to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development. In accordance with the decision by the provincial 
party committee standing committee, let me discuss the 
province's present situation and how to study and implement the 
"Decision" adopted by the 14th CPC National Congress at its 
Third Plenary Session. 
<H5>  I. Guangdong's Current Reform and Development Situation </H5>
  Since the beginning of this year, the provincial party 
committee's line of thinking on its work has been: Actively and 
steadily carry forward reforms in various fields of endeavor, 
centering on the reform goal of establishing the socialist 
market economic structure and the strategic task of basically 
achieving modernization within 20 years, with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important southern tour talks and the spirit of the 
14th CPC National Congress as the guide; earnestly implement the 
central instructions on tightening macroregulation and control, 
strengthening infrastructures, basic industries, new, high-tech 
industries, and agriculture, and promoting the province's 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, with 
deepening reform as the only way out to solve difficulties and 
problems cropping up in the course of development; and improve 
party style and strengthening the building of clean government 
and promoting the formation of sound social practices, with the 
stress on establishing an anticorruption mechanism and doing a 
good job of comprehensive management of public security. For 
this purpose, the provincial party committee held several 
important meetings one after another and made corresponding 
decisions, which have been conscientiously implemented by the 
party committees at all levels. The strategic objective of 
striving to basically achieve modernization within 20 years and 
the line of thinking and major measures for work set by the 
seventh party congress, which was held in May and served as a 
link between the past and future, has always been to encourage 
the party members and masses of people throughout the province 
to overcome difficulties and forge ahead while breaking new 
ground. Thanks to the creative and hard work of the party 
organizations at various levels and the broad masses of cadres 
and people, the province has a good expansion momentum in reform 
and development, whose main manifestations are as follows: 
  -- Reform has made new advances. Further progress 
has been made in changing the way enterprises operate. The 218 
provincial enterprises conducting comprehensive reform 
experiments have achieved marked results in changing operational 
mechanisms and played a leading role in this regard. The reform 
of three enterprise systems has been extended to all enterprises 
from selected ones. Joint-stock system reform has been 
conducted on a larger scale and some cities have made innovative 
advances where the joint-stock system is being gradually 
standardized. Localities have organized a number of joint-stock 
limited companies and strengthened management of joint-stock 
companies and securities markets, ensuring the sound and lively 
operation of securities businesses. A joint-stock cooperation 
system has been comprehensively introduced in the rural areas 
and the number of rural enterprises under the various forms of 
joint-stock cooperation system is now 30,000 or so, with their 
operations expanding from township and town industries to 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, 
communications, and service trades. A rural socialized service 
system is gradually taking shape. The province has made further 
efforts to energetically develop specialized commodity trading 
markets and actively and steadily fostered the futures market, 
first in China in transaction volume terms. The markets for 
talent, labor, and scientific and technological research 
achievements are being operated on a more regular and standard 
basis. Social insurance system reform is moving toward 
establishing a system characterized by separation of government 
and administrative powers, unified leadership, management at 
different levels, and better supervision. Governments at all 
levels have conducted useful explorations in changing functions 
and institutional reform is being accelerated. 
  -- Fresh achievements have been scored in opening up to 
the outside world. The open regions and areas have further 
expanded. The three special economic zones, four economic and 
technological development zones, six new high-tech development 
zones, and over 100 approved economic development experimental 
zones have achieved quite good results in promoting development 
by opening up to the outside world. On the basis of the big 
growth achieved last year, the utilization of foreign capital 
has maintained its strong growth momentum. In foreign capital 
utilization the amount of direct foreign investment has 
increased, investment fields have been expanded, composition of 
investment has been optimized, projects using foreign investment 
have been extended in scale, and the number of years set for 
cooperation has been increased, as has the number of big 
financial groups and transnational corporations investing in the 
province. The foreign capital which has been utilized this year 
is expected to grow by 65 percent over last year, another 
historical best level. The growth momentum of exports has 
weakened and export trade is expected to increase by 10 percent 
over last year. 
  -- The economy has developed at an accelerated rate and 
with better efficiency. As the external environment has 
undergone quite big changes and the difficulties cropping up in 
the course of advance have multiplied, the province has 
continued to maintain its high economic growth rate and improved 
efficiency by deepening reform and opening up wider to the 
outside world. The GDP is expected to grow by 21 percent over 
last year. On the basis of a relatively big increase last year, 
industrial production has continued to maintain its rapid growth 
momentum, with steady increases in production and sales and an 
improvement in efficiency. In the first 10 months of this year, 
the sales income of industrial enterprises with independent 
accounting increased by 45 percent over last year. Profits 
increased while losses decreased. 
  Industrial output value is expected to increase by 35 
percent over last year with a sales rate of 95 percent or so. 
As agricultural production suffered from serious natural 
disasters, grain and sugar production dropped but township and 
town enterprises maintained their growth. It is anticipated 
that total agricultural output value will increase by 3 percent. 
The production composition of agriculture has been further 
optimized, "three highs" agriculture has developed at an 
accelerated rate, with its overall efficiency improving 
remarkably. The targets of greening work have been roughly 
attained and the task of greening Guangdong has been 
accomplished two years ahead of schedule. 
  -- Innovative advances have been made in infrastructure 
construction. The construction in the power, 
communications, and telecommunications industries has developed 
quite quickly, boosting the staying power for further economic 
development. The additional installed capacity is expected to 
amount to 35 to 40 million kwh. The increased installed capacity 
in a year exceeded the province's total additional capacity 
before the reform and opening up to the outside world drive was 
launched. The province has an additional 150 km of expressways, 
300 km of first-grade roads, and over 1,600 km of other roads 
and an additional 158 km of railroad. The telephone system has 
a capacity of 2.2 million sets. Localities in the province, be 
they coastal or mountainous, have undertaken communications 
projects as of top importance. The communications projects 
which have been carried out, are unprecedentedly large in scale, 
high in standard, and rapid in speed. 
  -- Financial revenues have increased, the people's 
incomes have gone up, and markets feature brisk buying and 
selling. The province's financial revenue is expected to 
grow by 35 percent and achieve a rough balance between revenue 
and expenditure with a small surplus. The per capita income for 
living costs of urban dwellers and the per capita cash income of 
the peasants have increased by 14 percent and 10 percent 
respectively, after deducting the price factor. The total 
retail sales volume of social commodities is expected to rise by 
30 percent from the previous year. 
  -- Comprehensive public security management has been 
carried out in a more down-to-earth manner. Since the 
beginning of this year, in view of the outstanding problems in 
social order, the province has launched special struggles to 
crack down on holdups on trains and buses and road robberies; 
triad criminal gangs; and prostitution and carried out an 
"antidrug and antigambling month" campaign and social-order 
improvement in selected areas and places, effectively checking 
the spread of criminal activities and ugly social phenomena. 
The measures, such as establishing an urban police patrol 
system, strengthening the building of grass-roots public 
security organizations, and combining "human, material, and 
technological resources" for security purposes have promoted the 
formation of a public security control system under which the 
masses are involved in public security control and management. 
  -- Party building and building clean government have 
been further strengthened. The provincial party committee 
has repeatedly stressed working hard to establish an effective 
mechanism to combat corruption and maintain incorruptibility. 
Party committees at all levels and discipline inspection and 
procuratorial organs have strengthened investigations, study, 
inspection, and supervision, actively strengthening this work. 
The provincial party committee standing committee held an 
expanded session in the middle of November to implement the 
central instruction and the spirit of the Second Plenary Session 
of the Central Discipline Commission and launched a struggle 
against corruption. Phased results have been achieved in the 
struggle since then. The anticorruption work has three 
distinctive characteristics: 1) principal party and government 
leaders personally take charge of the work; 2) phased objectives 
were combined with long-term objectives and temporary solutions 
with permanent solutions; and 3) the struggle against corruption 
within the party was combined with that to eliminate ugly 
phenomena in society at large. The struggle against corruption 
was carried out in a down-to-earth and healthy manner. Party 
organizations at all levels universally organized their members 
to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, in particular, Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the new party 
Constitution, and knowledge about the socialist market economy 
to improve their quality in the light of practical work. In 
connection with the new leadership elections, leading bodies at 
various levels readjusted and substantiated themselves becoming 
more revolutionary, younger in average age, and more 
knowledgeable and professional. 
  There were still weak links in work last year. We must face 
reality and the future, affirm what we have achieved, face 
problems squarely, and accomplish greater things so that 
Guangdong can advance with bigger strides in its reform and 
development. 
<H3>  II. Conscientiously Study the "Decision" by the Party's 
Third Plenary Session </H3>
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
which was held when China's economic structural reform was 
developed in depth, had great and profound historic 
significance. The "Decision" adopted systematized and made 
concrete the objective of economic structural reform and the 
basic principles set by the 14th CPC National Congress. It is a 
program of action to quicken the pace of reform and development 
and carry on modernization under the great banner of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. We must conscientiously study and 
comprehensively implement it and accelerate the establishment of 
the socialist market economic structure. We must combine the 
study of the "Decision" with study of Volume 3 of Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping; and study of rudimentary knowledge 
about the market economy with the summary of practical 
experience in reform and opening up over the last 15 years and 
with the absorption and use for reference of foreign advanced 
experiences. Through the study, we can acquire a profound 
understanding of the essence of the "Decision," master it as a 
theoretical and ideological weapon, unify our thinking, enhance 
our awareness in implementing the "Decision," and bring our 
initiative and creativity into play in our work. 
  Does socialism need a market economy? Can socialism 
pursue a market economy? This is the question we must fully 
understand above all else. Guangdong's 15 years of reform and 
opening up have proven that to develop the economy, it is 
necessary to pursue a market economy. The economic structural 
reform we have carried out in the last 10 years or so is, in 
fact, a gradual transition from the planned economy to a 
socialist market economic structure. This is precisely where 
the dynamic force of the province's sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development lies. The "Decision" points out: 
The socialist market economic structure is integrated with the 
basic system of socialism. In my view, it has two meanings: 
One is that the market economy is not the essential difference 
between socialism and capitalism and socialism must and can 
practice market economy; the other is that practicing market 
economy under socialism has its own characteristics. In 
establishing the socialist market economic structure, it is 
necessary to follow the general laws governing the market 
economy. Different states with different socialist systems 
differ from one another and have their own strong points in 
pursuing the market economic structure. Establishing the 
socialist market economic structure is part and parcel of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. In the Volume 3 of his selected works, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has incisive and systematic expositions on 
this issue. In early 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered 
important talks during his inspection tour of south China and 
once again showed great foresight and made brilliant judgments, 
which constitute the theoretical basis for us to establish the 
socialist market economic structure. 
  In the final analysis, what kind of socialist market 
economic 
structure are we going to establish? This is a question which 
we should fully understand. The "Decision" has systematically 
and incisively expounded on the question. The purpose in 
establishing a socialist market economic structure is to enable 
the market to play a basic role in the disposition of resources 
under macroregulation and control by the state. To achieve 
this, it is necessary to form the market main bodies, market 
system, regulation and control system, distribution system, 
security system, science and education structure, and the legal 
system as an integral whole. We must start with these basic 
issues, deepen our understanding of the socialist market 
economic structure, and carry out reform with greater 
willingness and initiative so that all work will become 
congruous with the operation of the market economy and 
Guangdong's economy will develop more rapidly and with better 
results. 
  How has Guangdong fared in establishing the socialist market 
economy? In the 15 years of reform and opening up, thanks to 
favorable social conditions, Guangdong introduced reform before 
others, conducted bold explorations with market economics as the 
orientation and made innovative advances. In the province's 
disposition of resources, the market has played an ever 
increasing great role and people's understanding of the laws 
governing the market economy has been gradually deepening. 
Compared with the requirements of the "Decision," we notice 
that the results Guangdong has achieved in reform formed only an 
initial foundation for establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. Our task in the days to come is still very arduous. 
Guangdong's initial experience still needs to undergo a 
practice again -- knowledge again -- improve again process. 
Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the existing state of 
affairs and stand still and refuse to make progress. We must 
arm our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, further emancipate our 
minds with the "Decision" as the guide, and push the province's 
reform to a new goal and a new height and deepen it in the 
spirit of boldly conducting explorations. This is the key to 
the basic realization of modernization within 20 years. 
<H3>  III. Accelerate the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure </H3>
  In accordance with the requirements of the "Decision" by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
province's realities, in the days ahead, we must speed the pace 
of establishing and improving the socialist market economic 
structure. For this purpose, the provincial party committee 
standing committee studied and worked out "Suggestions for 
Solving Some Issues Concerning the Acceleration of the 
Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic Structure (Draft 
for Discussion)" and submitted it to the current session for 
examination and approval. The general purpose is to set the 
objectives and tasks of establishing the socialist market 
economic structure, carry them out in an orderly way and step by 
step in the light of the realities in Guangdong, make 
breakthroughs at selected points, gradually improve them, and 
strive to set up the basic framework of the socialist market 
economic structure within five years. Let me now focus my 
discussion on five issues concerning the current work. 
  First, there should be great breakthroughs made in 
enterprise system reform. Overall, the province's existing 
enterprises still cannot meet the requirements of the market 
economy. As the market economy develops, this problem will 
become more pronounced. A modern enterprise system is the 
foundation of the market economic structure and the backing of 
local economic development. We must pay close attention to 
enterprise system reform and make breakthroughs at selected 
points to promote the reform as a whole. Attention should be 
paid to the following issues: 1) we must correctly assess 
enterprise assets, be clear about the relations of property 
rights, and ensure the value of public assets will be maintained 
and increased; 2) we must concentrate our efforts on 
establishing a modern enterprise system, with the stress on 
developing joint-stock enterprises, solve the problems such as 
that property rights are confused, no distinction is made 
between government and enterprise functions, the practice is 
pursued whereby everybody eats from the same big pot of the 
government, state-owned assets are used for other than public 
purposes, and enterprises are riddled with debts and 
overstaffing, mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprise cadres and 
employees, and enhance the vitality of enterprises; 3) We must 
form a number of enterprise group companies and make them 
competitive "dragon's head" enterprises; 4) we must carry out 
reform in the light of the different conditions of enterprises, 
with well conceived plans, steady steps, and adequate support 
measures, and do a good job of ideological work to win the 
support of the cadres and employees; and 5) we must establish a 
new system for the newly established enterprises so that they 
operate from the very outset in line with the requirements of 
the market economy and of the "Decision." 
  Second, there should be a great change in the 
government's function to manage the economy. Along with 
the reform in the enterprise system, financial and taxation 
systems, and banking structure and the establishment of the 
market economic structure as a whole, it has obviously become 
more imperative to change the government functions. The 
functions of governments at all levels are different and so are 
their economic management functions. However, as local 
governments, they have many common points. Therefore, the 
overall demand is that while continuing to carry reform forward 
energetically, they must strengthen macroregulation and control, 
change their regulation and control measures, energize their 
service functions, improve work efficiency, change the 
management methods of the traditional planned economy, focus 
their attention mainly on overall planning, make good use of 
policies, use organizational coordination with information as 
the guide, provide adequate services as well as inspection and 
supervision. For the government to manage the economy, first of 
all, it must pay keen attention to planning and work out plans 
for social and economic development, and also urban and rural 
construction, whose implementation should be ensured by laws and 
regulations. For the government to develop the economy, it must 
promote economic development through reform and opening up and 
pay close attention to such issues as infrastructure 
construction, optimization and readjustment of industrial 
structure, construction and management of the investment 
environment, coordinated development of different regions, 
training qualified personnel, control of population growth, and 
environmental protection. The government must promote the 
development of the other economic entities by means of policy 
guidance, organizational coordination, and adequate services. 
It is necessary to bring into full play the roles of the 
banking, financial and taxation, auditing, industrial and 
commercial, judicial, and other functional departments to manage 
and develop the economy. It is also necessary to give play to 
the role of large group companies as the dragon heads in 
developing the economy and the servicing and guiding roles of 
intermediary organizations. The change of the government's 
function to manage the economy must be combined with enterprise 
system reform and institutional reform. 
  Third, we must pay close attention to financial and 
taxation structural reform. The central authorities have 
decided to carry out a tax sharing system next year and we must 
carry out the reform conscientiously. The contract system, 
which Guangdong has practiced for many years, has played a very 
great role in smashing the pattern of total control over revenue 
and expenditure under the highly centralized planned economy, 
mobilizing the enthusiasm of localities in increasing revenues 
and cutting expenditures, striking a balanced budget, and 
developing their economies, and in "breeding fish by retaining 
water the [xu shui yang yu 5552 3055 7402 7625]" and "enlarging 
the cake [zuo da dan gao 0976 1129 7551 4741]." Its development 
direction will surely be in line with the tax sharing system 
commensurate with China's national conditions. The priority for 
the financial and taxation reform in the short term set by the 
"Decision" is to turn the existing local financial contract 
system into a tax sharing system based on a rational definition 
of central and local administrative powers and establish central 
and local taxation systems. For this purpose, we must do our 
work well, submit ourselves to the overall situation of reform 
and the interests of the state, ensure the smooth implementation 
of the financial and taxation reform, and protect the enthusiasm 
of governments at all levels in developing the economy, opening 
up more financial avenues, and increasing revenues and cutting 
expenditures. In accordance with this principle, we must 
continue to improve the province's current financial structure 
so that it will converge with the state financial and taxation 
structural reform and implement the plan to improve it as 
quickly as possible. Governments and departments at all levels 
must ensure in an active and responsible way that the province's 
current financial structure will converge with the state 
financial and taxation structural reform. They must 
particularly improve taxation means, increase revenues and cut 
expenditures, control financial expenditures, strengthen tax 
collection according to law, improve tax collection methods, 
tighten supervision, and plug loopholes. In the days to come, 
governments at all levels must display the spirit of hard work 
and thrift, make careful calculations and strictly budget 
financial spending, save what can be saved, and guard against 
extravagance, waste, and extravagant spending. Developing the 
economy and increasing tax funds are fundamental to financial 
reform. We must make sure that introducing tax reform will help 
better promote rather than hamper the province's economic 
development and financial revenues. All localities must 
conscientiously solve this problem in the light of their own 
realities. 
  Fourth, we must continue to open up wider to the 
outside world and promote reform and development by opening 
up. Opening up wider to the outside world is a strong point 
in the province. We must develop new avenues of opening up and 
uplift it to a new height. We must strive for breakthroughs in 
the days ahead in diversifying the market, importing high-tech 
projects, and inviting large international financial groups to 
invest in China. We must make earnest efforts to run the 
state-approved 13 economic zones of various types and a number 
of the province-approved economic and technological development 
zones and promote the development of the rest of the province 
with these zones serving as windows and bases for reform. We 
must absorb foreign capital to transform a number of existing 
enterprises, develop new industries, build infrastructure, 
further open domestic markets to the outside world, import 
hardware and, even more, software, and attach importance to 
talent, advanced management methods, and expertise. We must run 
properly the existing tens of thousands of foreign- invested 
enterprises, enterprises engaged in processing with supplied 
materials and samples, assembling with supplied parts, and 
compensation trade; give play to their positive role in 
developing the province's economy; and expand their positive 
influence abroad. We must step up our efforts to promptly solve 
the problems of neglecting the employees' safety and interests. 
We must improve the investment-seeking work, set up special 
organs, expand the current staff to handle the work extensively 
and meticulously, combine going abroad to seek investment and 
introducing investment from abroad, and combine introduction of 
large foreign investment on a comprehensive basis and regular 
introduction of investment on an item-by-item basis. While 
inviting foreign investment, we must actively open up 
international markets, export more goods, and strive to earn 
more foreign exchange. We must further develop and run 
enterprises overseas and raise construction funds abroad through 
many channels and methods. We must continue to make full use of 
the strong points of the Hong Kong and Macao region and, at the 
same time, absorb the achievements of all civilizations of human 
society from other countries, extensively introduce other 
countries' strong points, and make them serve our own purposes. 
We must energetically train qualified people engaged in foreign 
trade, further improve the investment environment, and create 
better conditions for opening up wider to the outside world. 
  Fifth, we must strengthen party leadership and ensure 
that work in all fields is carried out properly. The task 
of reform for the coming year is arduous. Party committees at 
all levels must enhance their awareness of reform, give emphasis 
to the priorities of reform, strengthen leadership over reform, 
and ensure the implementation of various reform measures. 
Reform is the driving force for economic development. We must 
be good at mobilizing people's enthusiasm and promoting economic 
development through reform. Reform is bound to involve the 
adjustment of interests of all sides concerned and cause some 
new contradictions. Therefore, we must be good at handling 
those contradictions well and ensure social stability and unity 
and the smooth progress of reform. It is a difficult and 
complex social systems engineering undertaking to establish the 
socialist market economic structure. Leaders at all levels must 
make overall planning, coordinate the forces of all side 
concerned, and make concerted efforts to accomplish the task. 
To be able to shoulder the heavy task of reform, leaders at all 
levels must take the lead in studying well Volume 3 of 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "Decision," 
raise their ideological level and professional competence, 
improve their work style, go deep into the realities of life to 
conduct thorough investigation and study, and do their work in a 
creative way. 
  As far as the economic work in the coming year is concerned, 
we must continue to implement the spirit of the seventh 
provincial party congress, which was held in May this year, and 
implement the plans and decisions adopted by the several 
important meetings the provincial authorities held this year. 
Particular stress should be placed on continuing to devote 
great efforts to the construction of infrastructure and the 
development of "three highs" agriculture, township and town 
enterprises, and the tertiary industry. In the overall economic 
work, attention should be paid to tapping potential, improving 
economic efficiency and product quality, and opening up more 
markets. In construction undertakings, we must proceed from 
actual conditions, act according to both our capability and 
modern standards, make good plans, and implement them step by 
step. In both urban and rural areas, we must guard against 
arbitrary and unplanned construction and unnecessary 
reconstruction to avoid waste. Importance should be attached to 
the protection, development, and utilization of water resources 
and to environmental protection. 
  In reform and opening up, as well as economic construction, 
we must strengthen the building of spiritual civilization. We 
must continue to implement the plan of the provincial party 
committee standing committee meeting, held this September, to 
struggle against corruption and conscientiously carry out the 
spirit of the provincial meeting on spiritual civilization work, 
which was held this November. Leading cadres at all levels must 
be strict with themselves and honest in performing official 
duties, pay keen attention to the struggle against corruption, 
and ensure the completion of the three tasks in the short term. 
We must continue to strengthen the comprehensive management of 
public security, severely punish criminals whose cases are 
serious, wipe out "seven evils," and create a safe and sound 
social environment for the work, study, and lives of the masses 
of people. We must strengthen ideological and political work, 
encourage a correct outlook on life and civilized lifestyles, 
and foster lofty professional ethics and social morality. We 
are firmly convinced that so long as we make unremitting efforts 
in this regard, we will be able to uplift the province's 
building of spiritual civilization to a new level every year. 
We firmly believe that after this session, party organizations 
at all levels will lead the people throughout the province in 
implementing the spirit of the "Decision" and Guangdong's 
reform, opening up, and modernization will surely take on a new 
look and be uplifted to a new level in the new year.

1627): "Wang Fengchao Stresses That Existing Hong Kong Travel 
Documents Will Continue to Be Valid After 1997"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Wang Fengchao, 
director of the Second Department of the State Council's Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has explained the transitional 
arrangements for Hong Kong travel documents to the Preliminary 
Work Committee's Social and Security Work Group. He said that 
after 1 July 1997, people holding BNO [British National 
Overseas] passports and CI's [Certificate of Identity] for Hong 
Kong permanent residents, or those holding a DI [Document of 
Identity], Seamen's identity certificates, or Hong Kong return 
permits may continue to use those travel documents to travel 
outside Hong Kong as long as the documents do not expire, so 
people do not need to worry about their current travel documents 
becoming invalid, which may affect their travel out of Hong Kong 
and their return to Hong Kong. Wang Fengchao stressed: This 
will be effected with the endorsement and full support of China, 
and China and Britain reached agreement on this through the 
Joint Liaison Group last year. As for the issuance of special 
administrative region [SAR] passports that Hong Kong people are 
now concerned about, a multidepartmental committee of the 
Chinese Government has begun to handle this work. It is 
expected that an initial plan will be formulated and the Social 
and Security Affairs Work Group will be briefed on the plan and 
will be consulted. 
  Fan Hsu Lai-tai, head of the Social and Security Work Group 
from the Hong Kong side, pointed out after the end of today's 
meeting that BNO passports are only a type of travel document; 
if BNO holders do not possess other countries' citizenship, they 
will still be treated as Chinese citizens and will still be 
eligible to apply for SAR passports; and Chinese citizens 
holding CI's may also apply for SAR passports. As BNO passports 
are regarded as only a type of travel document, BNO holders may 
simultaneously hold SAR passports.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Liu Xianri (0491 7639 2480) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- A five-day State 
Council conference on the resettlement of residents of areas 
affected by the Three Gorges project ended today. Zou Jiahua, 
vice premier of the State Council, and Qian Zhengying, vice 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, attended the conference. In 
his speech summing up the conference, Chen Junsheng, state 
councillor and vice chairman of the Three Gorges Project 
Construction Committee, stressed that various localities and 
departments should fully understand the importance of resettling 
the residents of the areas affected by the Three Gorges project, 
accurately understand and implement the resettlement principles, 
and properly handle the following relationships so as to ensure 
the appropriate settlement of those residents: 
  First, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between the construction of the Three Gorges project and 
economic development. The construction of this project will 
bring an unprecedented opportunity for the economic development 
of the areas along the Three Gorges. Moreover, with the 
implementation of preferential policies adopted by the state, it 
is bound to attract large amounts of funds from abroad and other 
parts of the country. This will be conducive to the economic 
development of the areas along the Three Gorges and to opening 
those areas to the outside world. We should "think about and 
look forward to the construction of the Three Gorges project," 
but we should not "be a drag on the project and just take 
advantage of it." 
  Second, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between the construction of the Three Gorges project and the 
distribution of productive forces across the country. The 
construction of the project is not only the business of Sichuan 
and Hubei provinces but the common undertaking of the people 
throughout the country. It is an unshirkable responsibility and 
obligation of people in all trades and professions to support 
the construction of the Three Gorges project and the 
resettlement of those residents affected by the project. 
  Third, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between migration and local economic development. We should 
clearly define the near-term goal of migration and the long-term 
objective of economic development in the resettlement areas and 
combine the former with the latter. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between agriculture on the one hand, and the secondary and 
tertiary industries on the other. Most residents affected by 
the Three Gorges project should be resettled in rural areas. In 
migrating people to rural areas, stress should be placed on 
agriculture. In areas with the necessary conditions, efforts 
should be made to develop the processing of agricultural and 
sideline products, transportation, service trade, and other 
secondary and tertiary industries according to local conditions 
in order to increase job opportunities for migrants. 
  Fifth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between settling problems on the spot and resettling people in 
other areas. We should implement the principle of resettling 
those people in areas close to the Three Gorges reservoir area 
and settling problems on the spot. When people from rural areas 
cannot be resettled this way, they may migrate to other areas; 
but the funds for this purpose should not exceed the 
compensation standard set by the state or the budgetary estimate 
approved by it. 
  Sixth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between support given by relevant departments and mutual 
benefit. Various localities and departments should first give 
consideration to support, but such support is not given without 
compensation. In actual work, it is essential to give support 
on the principle of being mutually complementary and beneficial, 
and working together for development from a long-term point of 
view. 
  Seventh, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship 
between the central and local authorities. In resettling the 
residents affected by the Three Gorges project, we should 
implement a resettlement management system under which "the 
central authorities exercise unified leadership, with provinces 
assuming their respective responsibilities and counties acting 
as the basic unit." By exercising unified leadership, it means 
that the central authorities mainly exercise leadership in 
principle and policy, and perform their functions in macro 
regulation and control. Assuming their respective 
responsibilities by provinces, with counties acting as the basic 
unit, means that, from now on, provinces should have full 
authority to handle matters that should be handled by them, in 
order to fully arouse the enthusiasm of local authorities. A 
responsibility system should be instituted from the central to 
local levels. 
  In concluding, Chen Junsheng stressed that it is most 
important to first resettle residents of the areas affected by 
the Three Gorges Dam. All the residents in the areas within 15 
square kilometers of the dam construction site should be 
migrated to other areas by the end of next year. Measures 
should be taken now to ensure that they will pass the winter 
safely.

  [Text] Chongqing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, a 
senior Chinese leader, has urged Chengdu, Chongqing and other 
pilot cities to take the lead in establishing a socialist market 
economic structure. 
  While inspecting the two cities in Sichuan Province during 
January 6-11, State Councillor Li Tieying said that Sichuan 
should blaze a new trail of speeding up the reform and opening 
wider to the outside world for other inland areas in the country. 
  The leader discussed how to promote the reform together with 
executives of major state-owned companies in Chengdu, the 
capital of Sichuan Province, and Chongqing, the leading 
manufacturing and commercial center in southwest China. He also 
visited a number of manufacturing companies in Chongqing. 
  Li, who is also the minister in charge of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, asked local officials 
to step up construction of transportation, telecommunications 
and energy facilities in Sichuan Province. 
  "Sichuan should also try to promptly institute a new 
economic 
system and an efficient operational mechanism," he said. 
  The leader also asked local officials to attract more funds, 
technology and personnel from other parts of China and the world. 
  Li said that current comprehensive reforms focus on the 
transformation of the operational mechanism of state-owned 
enterprises, the introduction of a modern enterprise system and 
implementation of macro-economic controls. 
  "In the course of the reform the government serves both as a 
director and the most important actor," he told local officials. 
  Therefore, government bodies must play a leading role in the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system, while transforming 
their own functions, he noted. 
  Li Tieying stressed the importance of freeing businesses 
from 
the burden of "running society" -- taking charge of all 
employees' welfare -- by introducing a social security system. 
  "Only by solving that problem will enterprises be able to 
become vigorous in market competition," he said. 
  Speaking of cultivating a market structure, the leader 
stressed the need to promote the construction of production 
factor markets, financial markets and technology markets, as 
well as intermediate agencies such as accounting, auditing and 
law offices.

<F P=106> ["Wu Bangguo Calls for Efforts to Accelerate Reform and </F>
Development under the Guidance of Deng Xiaoping's Theory of 
Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics; Huang Ju 
Reports on Arrangements for Economic Work at the Second Plenum 
of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee"] 
  [Text] The Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee was held in the Shanghai Exhibition 
Center from 20 to 22 December. 
  Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, 
delivered an important speech at the meeting. The speech was 
entitled: "Accelerate Reform and Development and Strive To 
Create a New Situation of Shanghai's Work Under the Guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory of Building Socialism With 
Chinese Characteristics." Huang Ju, deputy secretary of the 
municipal party committee and mayor of Shanghai, made a report 
on Shanghai's arrangements for implementing the guidelines of 
the national conference on economic work. 
  The main themes of the discussion at the meeting were to 
further study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping and the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee; to emancipate the mind and unify 
the understanding under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to 
sum up this year's work and put forward ideas for next year's 
work; to mobilize all party members and the people in Shanghai 
to seize the opportunity to speed up reform and development; to 
strive to make a breakthrough in taking the lead in building the 
operating mechanisms of a socialist market economy; and to make 
efforts to maintain the favorable momentum of sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of our national economy. 
  The plenary session maintained: In the current year, a new 
situation has been created in the various aspects of Shanghai's 
work under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee 
and the State Council, and through the common efforts of the 
broad masses of cadres and people throughout the municipality. 
The national economy continues to follow a favorable trend of 
development on the foundation of last year's rapid growth. Our 
economic restructuring has been further deepened, and the basic 
role of the market in the allocation of resources has been 
further enhanced; new progress has been made in our efforts to 
attract foreign capital and develop Pudong; fruitful results 
have been accomplished in infrastructural construction, and new 
achievements have been made in various undertakings. The 
changeover of leading groups at various levels in the party and 
the government has been smoothly completed, and party building 
has been further strengthened. Presently, the overall situation 
in Shanghai is good, being characterized by political and social 
stability, and economic development. The confidence of the 
people in realizing a glorious tomorrow has been boosted. 
  The plenary session held that Shanghai's new achievements 
this year in the building of the material and spiritual 
civilizations have been made with the concern and support of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as well as that of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older 
generation; that they are also the fruits of arduous struggle 
and hard work of the broad masses of people; and that they could 
not have been made without the efforts of the municipal party 
committees and governments over the years in laying a solid 
foundation, as well as without the staunch support shown by the 
various ministries and commissions under the central government, 
without the support given by various brotherly provinces and 
municipalities, and without the participation and support of the 
broad masses of commanders and fighters from the troops 
stationed in Shanghai. 
  The plenary session stressed: The economic work for next 
year 
will be launched on the basis of the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic growth over the past two years, and it must 
have a higher starting point. We should maintain the favorable 
momentum of Shanghai's economic development under the premise of 
combining the market, product quality, and economic benefits. 
We should continue to increase the proportion of the tertiary 
industry in our gross national product. We must give priority 
to road and power construction, speed up urban infrastructural 
construction, and strive to complete a number of major 
engineering projects. We should accelerate Pudong's pace of 
development and opening up to the outside world, and keep up the 
forceful momentum of economic development in the new area. We 
should, on the basis of our economic development, further raise 
the actual living standards of urban and rural people. Economic 
development calls for new ideas, and it is necessary to firmly 
grasp the key links that have a bearing on the overall situation 
of Shanghai, and to earnestly study the new situation and new 
problems that have emerged in the course of our economic work so 
as to really direct our economic construction onto the track of 
improving our economic results. We must further heighten our 
consciousness toward market competition, actively develop 
domestic and foreign markets, strengthen our business 
management, and enhance our enterprises' quality and competitive 
edge. We must, under the guidance of macro-control, raise funds 
through multichannels and make good use of the funds to increase 
our economic returns. We should further expand our scale of 
bringing in foreign capital, broaden the scope for utilizing 
foreign funds, and strive to integrate our utilization of 
foreign funds with readjustment of industrial structure, product 
structure, and development of new economic growth, as well as 
give full play to Shanghai's superiority in technology and 
qualified personnel to develop new and high-technology 
industries along with a new generation of pillar industry, and 
establish a number of major groups and large companies with an 
international competitive edge. We must practically consolidate 
the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national 
economy, strive to develop agriculture that produces high-yield, 
high quality products with high economic efficiency, develop 
village and town enterprises as well as the tertiary industry, 
and push forward the urbanization construction in the rural 
areas. 
  The plenary session pointed out: In the past few years 
Shanghai's economy has been able to maintain a favorable 
momentum of development mainly because it has benefited from 
reform and opening up to the outside world. We must consolidate 
our reform achievements, and we must uphold and strive to 
constantly improve what has proven effective. In accordance 
with the requirements of the "decision" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we should make the 
deepening of reform and the active exploration for a modern 
enterprise system the emphasis of accelerating the reform next 
year. We must give play to the basic role of the market in the 
allocation of resources under macroeconomic control, further 
cultivate and develop markets for production factors, strengthen 
the standardized administration of the market, and actively 
carry out reform of prices in a steady way. In line with the 
unified plan of the central authorities, we should actively 
accelerate reform of the taxation, financial, investment, and 
planning systems. While promoting the development of the state- 
owned and collectively owned sectors of the economy, we should 
encourage the development of individual undertakings and 
privately owned and foreign-owned enterprises. In the new year, 
leading cadres at all levels should keep in mind the overall 
situation, straighten out the overall structure and relationship 
of interests among different sectors, do a good job in 
ideological work, show concern for the vital interests of the 
masses, and ensure the smooth implementation of all reform 
measures. 
  The plenary session held: Strengthening the building of a 
socialist spiritual civilization and sticking to the principle 
that both material civilization and spiritual civilization 
should be promoted in real earnest and neither aspect should be 
neglected constitute the important content of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; the requirements for Shanghai's 
work set by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping; and the wish of the Shanghai people. In 
the course of developing a socialist market economy, we should 
strengthen education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; 
strengthen the building of professional ethics, social morality, 
and family moral principles; and actively carry forward the 
64-character pioneering spirit initiated by Comrade Jiang Zemin. 
We should carry out our propaganda work and education in 
conjunction with the education on cherishing Shanghai and on 
realizing the goal of creating major changes in three years and 
with the efforts to improve Shanghai's appearance and 
environment, to provide civilized good-quality services, to 
flourish our cultural undertakings, and to mobilize all trades 
and professions to achieve outstanding results and present them 
as a gift to the 45th anniversary of the founding of New China. 
We should further strengthen our comprehensive effort to improve 
social security, crack down on criminal activities according to 
law, resolutely check all ugly phenomena in society, persist in 
launching the anticorruption struggle, and create a favorable 
social environment for reforms, opening up to the outside world, 
and economic construction. 
  The plenary session issued the following requirements: Party 
organizations at all levels must take the study of Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the 
"decisions" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee as their priority tasks for 1994, unify their 
thinking, and unify their action. Party and government leading 
cadres should take the lead in studying the works. They should 
read the original works seriously, trying to understand and 
master them. They should carry forward the Marxist study style 
of integrating theory with practice, consciously integrate the 
guidelines of the Central Committee with work in their 
localities and departments, and improve their work style and 
leading ability. In studying the works, they must stick to the 
quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
fact; seize "the last opportunity" for Shanghai's development in 
the 1990's; enhance their sense of responsibility and urgency; 
be modest and prudent; continue to advance; consciously adhere 
to the principle of "conducive to three causes" -- conducive to 
developing the productive forces of our socialist society, 
increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, 
improving the people's living standards; be fearless in 
practice; be brave in pushing forward reform and construction; 
and creatively do their tasks well. 
  The plenary session issued the following calls: All 
communist party members and people in Shanghai, under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, work with one heart 
and one mind, unite in struggle, and make new contributions to 
fulfilling Shanghai's grand goal of reform and construction. 
  The plenary session decided to promote Bao Qifan, alternate 
member of the municipal party committee, to its member. 
  Attending the session were 51 members and alternate members 
of the municipal party committee. More than 150 party and 
government responsible cadres from various departments, 
commissions, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus attended 
the session as observers.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Dec (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently issued a circular on implementing the public service 
system plan, calling on all localities and departments to 
seriously implement the plan in consideration of their actual 
situation. 
  The circular states: To formulate and implement the public 
service system is an important event in China's political life. 
It is an important content of the reform of the political 
system, as well as a necessity in establishing a socialist 
market economy. It is of great significance to increasing the 
building of clean and honest government as well as to improving 
the quality of state functionaries and the efficiency of the 
administration. All localities and departments should attach 
great importance to the public service system and 
conscientiously strengthen leadership over its implementation. 
  The circular points out: The public service system should be 
carried out step by step in a planned manner in conjunction with 
organizational reform. The personnel positions, staffing, and 
non- leadership jobs must not be finalized before the 
"three-fix" plan [san ding fang an 0005 1353 2455 2714] is 
approved. Units which have not yet carried out organizational 
reform should actively organize the implementation of the 
systems for hiring, performance appraisal, awards, discipline, 
training, challenge [hui bi 0932 6699], and retirement. During 
the course of implementing the public service system, it is 
strictly prohibited to enlarge the scope of implementation, 
establish unauthorized positions, and rush promotion or transfer 
of cadres. Violation of regulations should be corrected in good 
time, and leading cadres concerned should be blamed for the 
violation. 
  The implementation plan for the public service system 
contains clear and definite stipulations on the scope, 
procedures, and methods of implementation. It also sets 
specific requirements for the current office staff to transit to 
the public service system, for the rank and grade of public 
servants, and for the establishment and appointment of 
non-leadership staff members. The plan emphasizes the necessity 
to implement the public service system under the leadership of 
party committees and governments, pay attention to studying new 
circumstances and new problems during the implementation, 
seriously strengthen the ideological and political work, and 
ensure a smooth implementation.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The fourth round of U.S.- 
China textile negotiations begins Saturday [15 January] with a 
new Chinese negotiator expected to fight 25-35 percent slashes 
in import quotas on Chinese textiles, sources in Beijing said. 
  According to reliable Chinese sources, Shi Guangsheng, vice 
minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Trade and 
Cooperation, will lead the Chinese delegation in the talks. 
  Shi takes the place of Zhou Keren, director of the 
ministry's 
trade administration department, who led the Chinese side in 
previous rounds. Zhou is also expected to be present at 
Saturday's talks, the source said. 
  The change is believed to be a result of demands by the 
chief 
U.S. negotiator, Jennifer Hillman, who has asked for a 
counterpart "with enough authority to make decisions," a U.S. 
Embassy spokesman said. 
  China agreed to resume talks last week after U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kanter announced on January 6 that the 
United States would be imposing lower import quotas on Chinese 
goods due to illegal transshipments of goods to the U.S. 
  Transshipments occur when goods are disguised, through false 
labeling and other means, to appear as if they were manufactured 
in a country other than the country of origin. 
  The U.S., which received over 7.3 billion dollars of Chinese 
textile imports in 1993, has accused the Chinese ministry of 
allowing an additional 2 billion dollars of textiles to enter 
the U.S. illegally, thus exceeding quotas established by the 
U.S.-China textile agreement. 
  The two countries have been embroiled in talks to amend and 
extend the agreement for nine months with transshipments, 
overshipments and copyright issues at the center of the dispute. 
  China clamped down on several companies believed to be 
involved in the illicit trade as late as last October, but 
apparently the U.S. is not satisfied with the progress. 
  The Chinese source would not speculate on the outcome of the 
three-day talks only saying, "It seems to be a political issue, 
which cannot be decided by the Chinese side."

"Zheng Hongye Criticizes the United States for Making a Mountain 
Out of a Molehill"] 
  [Text] Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade, criticized the United States 
yesterday for having "made a mountain out of a molehill" on the 
issue of Chinese textile import. Although Zheng expressed the 
hope that the Sino-U.S. talks in two days time would be a 
complete success, he stressed that the mainland has a very big 
trading market. Anyway, "if not in the east, then in the west," 
he said. 
  When answering reporters' questions at a closed-door meeting 
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
[ARATS] in Beijing yesterday, Zheng Hongye said: U.S. trade 
makes up only a small portion of the mainland's total foreign 
trade volume and is "not worth mentioning." 
  He stressed that there are different views and opinions 
between China and the United States and the two sides have held 
several talks on the textiles issue. He believed, provided both 
sides observe the principle of "equality and mutual benefit," 
the problem will not be hard to resolve. However, if one keeps 
only itself in mind, it will be very hard to resolve the issue. 
  He refuted the U.S. criticism that the mainland is not 
opening its market, saying that the it has never closed its 
doors to the U.S. market. What actually happened is that the 
mainland wanted to import some commodities from the United 
States, the latter refused to offer. But he did not clearly 
point out what the commodities were. 
  On the forthcoming Sino-U.S. meeting on the textiles issue, 
which will be held from 15 to 17 January, Zheng Hongye stressed 
that he was confident that substantive results would be achieved. 
  He also said, if the United States insisted on imposing 
economic sanctions on the mainland, the development of bilateral 
trade would be harmed. Anyway, he said, if the United States 
really imposes economic sanctions, the mainland still has many 
trade markets outside, "if not in the east, then in the west."

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY 
[RENMIN RIBAO], the leading national newspaper, carries a signed 
article today, hailing the role of Deng Xiaoping in promoting 
the opening up and development of the Pudong New Area in 
Shanghai, the country's largest industrial city. 
  Written by Huang Qifan, the article says that Deng Xiaoping 
was the originator of the policy of opening the Pudong New Area 
to the outside world and turning it into a development zone. 
  After inspecting Shanghai and returning to Beijing in early 
1990, the article reveals, Deng told leaders of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party of 
China (CPC) that although he had retired, he still had to remind 
them of the importance of the development of the Pudong area. 
  In April 1990 the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council, the country's supreme governing bodies, officially 
announced an important decision on the opening up and 
development of the Pudong area, listing it as a national focal 
point of the country's opening and development projects in the 
following ten years. 
  Deng pointed out that the opening up of Shanghai would bring 
about great changes to the Chang Jiang Delta, the Chang Jiang 
Valley and even the whole country. 
  After listening to a report about the work of the 
development 
of the Pudong area delivered by Zhu Rongji, then mayor of 
Shanghai, in February 1991, Deng said, "Finance is important. 
It is the core of a modern economy. If financial work is done 
well it will be easy to get everything done well. Shanghai used 
to be a banking center, where various currencies could be 
exchanged freely. It is necessary to return to this practice. 
China's hope for occupying an international position in finance 
should first be pinned on Shanghai." 
  Following Deng's instructions, Shanghai has given priority 
to 
finance in the development of the Pudong area. In the past 
three years 38 new domestic and overseas financial enterprises 
have been set up in Shanghai. The total deposits in the banks 
in Pudong have reached 25 billion yuan, while the banks' loans 
have amounted to 24 billion yuan -- about 12 times the figures 
for 1990. Meanwhile, the stock market, and insurance and other 
financial businesses have developed rapidly, thus greatly 
promoting the development of various industries such as 
construction and commerce. 
  Deng also showed great concern about the development of 
infrastructure and high-tech industries in the Pudong New Area. 
He has repeatedly stressed the importance of building several 
bridges over the Huangpu River in the area and the importance of 
focusing funds on construction projects in the power, 
communications and other infrastructural sectors. Besides, he 
pointed out that quick economic development depended on science, 
technology and education. A breakthrough in the field of 
high-technology will bring about the development of many 
industries, he noted. 
  The article also discloses that in the past few years Deng 
has given many instructions on development of the Pudong area. 
He once urged Shanghai people to further broaden their minds, 
be bolder and quicken their pace in the opening up and 
development of the Pudong area. Last year in Shanghai Deng 
called on Shanghai people to continue to make efforts, overcome 
difficulties and strive for further achievements. 
  The article lists various achievements Shanghai has made in 
opening up and developing the Pudong area, and says that Deng's 
strategic policies have been carried out in the course of this 
opening up and development.

  [Summary] Shandong Province has succeeded in improving its 
auto industry to a new level thanks to vigorously readjusting 
the mix of products, introducing advanced technologies from 
foreign countries, and setting up technical and economic 
associations with fraternal provinces. In 1993 the province 
realized a total output of 7.68 billion yuan, which showed a 38 
percent increase over 1992 and realized 740 million yuan of 
profits and taxes, which showed a 46 percent increase over 1992. 
The sale rate of products reached more than 95 percent. During 
the year, the province turned out 176 varieties of new products. 
Of these varieties, four reached the world standard; 11 filled 
the national gaps in this regard; and 35 reached the national 
advanced standards. The rate of output value of these new 
products reached 31.7 percent which surpasses that of 1992 by 10 
percent.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 12 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province reported record economic development in 1993. 
  Its gross domestic product last year went up by 25 percent 
over the previous year to 164.5 billion yuan-worth. 
  A provincial official attributed the success to the 
deepening 
of the reform, improving economic results and technical 
upgrading. 
  Last year saw the province's industrial output value amount 
to 392.8 billion yuan, up 52.5 percent over the 1992 figure. 
  Meanwhile, its agricultural output value went up by 1.9 
percent to 39.36 billion yuan, thanks to a successful 
rearrangement of the product mix. 
  As a result, the income of urban residents last year 
averaged 
3,400 yuan per capita, up 18 percent over the previous year, and 
that of rural people was 1,590 yuan per capita, up six percent.

Fast"] 
  [Text] Haikou--Hainan, one of China's five special 
economic zones, reported an industrial output value of 9.3 
billion yuan ($1.07 billion) last year. 
  The figure marked an increase of 29 percent over the 
previous 
year, surpassing the national industrial growth rate. 
  Officials said it was the first time that Hainan's 
industrial 
output exceeded its agricultural yield. 
  Last year, Hainan saw a year-end industrial profit of 430 
million yuan ($49.4 million), up 164 percent over the previous 
year. Revenue collected in the sector hit 358 million yuan 
($41.15 million). 
  Meanwhile, 800 million yuan ($92 million) was invested 
during 
the year to modernize industrial production in the province. 
The figure was 64 percent more than in 1992. 
  A meeting held to discuss industrial strategy, which 
concluded last week, set a target of 30-percent growth for 
industrial production in the new year. 
  Industrial firms are being encouraged to pump out a total of 
12.1 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in industry output in 1994. 
The annual industrial profit is expected to grow by 24 percent 
to hit 534 million yuan ($61.4 million) if that goal is reached. 
  Provincial officials have also vowed to reduce the number of 
enterprises operating in the red by 40 this year. This would 
represent a drop of 7.5 percent in the number of enterprises 
running a deficit.

  [Excerpts] A Henan provincial economic work meeting opened 
in Zhengzhou yesterday. Provincial Party Secretary Li Changchun 
made an important speech at the opening ceremony. 
  He stressed: We should take the decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guidance, 
conscientiously implement central policies and measures on 
strengthening agricultural and rural economic development, 
persist in taking agriculture as the foundation in the course of 
establishing the socialist market economic structure, actively 
orient enteprises toward the market, and speed up the pace of 
making the people prosperous. 
  The opening ceremony was presided over by Governor Ma 
Zhongchen. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, Li Changchun first analyzed the province's 
current agricultural and rural situation. He said: Following 
the deepening of reform in the 1990's, Henan's economy has 
entered a new development period. Agriculture has started 
transforming from a single type of cultivation structure into an 
overall aspect embracing agriculture, forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Industry, 
commerce, construction, and transportation are are undergoing 
comprehensive transformation. The rural economy is developing 
from the small-peasant economy into an open socialist market 
economy. Most peasants are beginning to move toward moderate 
prosperity after resolving the problem of adequate food and 
clothing. New vitality and vigor are emerging in the entire 
agriculture and rural economy. In the last three years, grain 
output has remained at more than 30 billion kg and stood at 35.3 
billion kg last year, a record high in history. The output of 
cotton, tobacco, and oil-bearing crops has remained stable. 
Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries 
have seen comparatively great development. After topping 100 
billion yuan in 1992, the gross output value of township and 
town enterprises throughout the province continued to grow in 
1993 and was expected to reach 195 billion yuan, an increase of 
62.5 percent over the previous year. In 1993 the peasant per 
capita net income was estimated at 660 yuan, an increase of 133 
yuan over 1990. 
  He pointed out: We must soberly understand that prominent 
problems obstructing the province's agricultural and rural 
economic development have not been fundamentally resolved. New 
contradictions and problems have emerged in rural reform, 
opening up, and economic development. Peasant income increases 
slowly, the rural socialized service system is imperfect, 
agricultural investment is inadequate, agriculture is not strong 
at resisting natural disasters, there are many instable factors 
in rural areas, peasant burdens have not been fundamentally 
resolved, and the situation in the social order is grim. 
[passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, Li Changchun pointed out: Henan is a big 
agricultural province, in which agriculture and the rural 
economy play a decisive role in entire national economic and 
social development. There is a need to strengthen party 
leadership over rural work to bring about faster and better 
development in the rural economy. Leading cadres at all levels 
should constantly improve their work style and work methods, 
strengthen their study and investigation, and enhance their 
leadership level. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Manila, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China will continue 
to make efforts in maintaining the political stability and 
economic prosperity in Asia and the Pacific region, a visiting 
Chinese congresswoman said here today. 
  Lin Liyun, head of a Chinese congressional delegation, made 
the commitment in her speech at the second general meeting of 
the Asia- Pacific Parliamentary Forum which opened here today. 
  Lin, member of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress of China, said many Asia-Pacific countries 
have proposed to set up an Asia-Pacific security mechanism which 
fully demonstrates a cherished aspiration of various countries 
to maintain peace, stability and security in the region. 
  However, she said, China holds that the establishment of any 
security mechanism must be in line with the regional diversities 
and complexities. 
  "Only such an initiative proceeds from the actual conditions 
and special characteristics in this region, can it enjoy the 
support by the most of the countries," she added. 
  The congresswoman said China will "continue bilaterally and 
regionally multi-tier, multi-channel and multi-form 
consultations and discussions with the parties concerned on this 
issue." 
  As for the economic development, Lin said the rapid growth 
momentum of Asia and the Pacific region had not been strangled 
by the dramatic changes of the world's political pattern. 
  With the sustained economic growth for many years, the 
average increase this year for the whole region is still 
estimated above 7 percent, much higher than the projections for 
the rest of the world. 
  Lin said the rapid development of different kinds of 
economic 
cooperations would enhance the stability in the region and lay a 
solid foundation to a comparative stability in the whole Asia- 
Pacific region. 
  While recognizing that peace, stability and economic 
development will remain a main stream of Asia and the Pacific, 
Lin warned against the continued existence of unstable factors 
in the region such as hegemonism, power politics and wilful 
interference in others' internal affairs. 
  "It is imperative that all the countries concerned shall 
make 
arduous efforts to maintain comparative stability and preserve 
high- speed economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region in the 
1990s and even in the next century," she stressed.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Luzhi (7115 7627 4160), vice chairman in </F>
charge of routine affairs with the All-China Committee for 
Pacific Economic Cooperation Standing Committee: "Asia-Pacific 
Region and the World Viewed From Seattle"] 
  [Text] The Seattle Conference on Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation [APEC] opened on 17 November and concluded on 20 
November. However, worldwide discussions and explorations on 
the significance and effects of the recent conference are far 
from concluded. We may put it that the Seattle conference was 
the most conspicuous of all world events that could play an 
important readjusting role in the Asia-Pacific region and the 
global pattern in the wake of the end of the Cold War. 
  The Seattle APEC Conference comprised three parts: First, 
the fifth routine session of the APEC ministerial meeting on 
17-19 November; second, the unofficial summit of the 12 
sovereign states of the 15 APEC member states and regions on 20 
November; and third, bilateral talks outside the conference, of 
which, the most notable was the official meeting between 
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton. The activities of 
these three parts overlapped each other and formed into a rich 
and colorful picture which has given much food for thought. The 
ministerial meeting viewed the prospective direction of 
Asia-Pacific's economic development, the unofficial summit 
instilled a very important political essence in APEC, whereas at 
the bilateral talks, especially the official Jiang Zemin-Clinton 
meeting, some important bilateral relations were explored and 
viewed anew from the higher tier of common interests on a 
regional or even global scale. Obviously, the APEC conference 
far exceeded the range of its original role, and is shaping into 
an important force that affects Asia-Pacific and even the global 
pattern. 
  On the issue of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, the 
ministerial meeting adopted the "Declaration on the Framework of 
Trade and Investment," established a committee for trade and 
investment, conducted coordination, and augmented cooperation 
between members on global trade and investment to promote 
regional free trade and reciprocal investment; firmly supported 
APEC members, who are not GATT members to become signatories; 
and were determined to add political pressure for the successful 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round before 15 December 1993. The 
APEC conference accepted Mexico and Papua New Guinea as new 
members, and decided to admit Chile to next year's ministerial 
meeting; nevertheless, no more new members are to be accepted 
for the next three years. 
  The non-official meeting of leaders issued a "Statement on 
Economic Prospects," which believes that the Asia-Pacific region 
will play an important role in the world economy and take the 
lead in economic development and trade expansion, calling for 
the continuous removal of the region's barriers to trade and 
investment and improving education and training to make progress 
in telecommunications and communications as well as 
environmental conditions. The leaders agreed to hold a 
conference for finance ministers, founding a forum of Pacific 
industry and commerce, and formulated plans for education and 
business volunteers to develop and promote tertiary education 
and the exploitation of human resources in the region. 
  During the conference, leaders of various countries 
conducted 
frequent bilateral contacts. President Jiang Zemin met 14 
leaders (including newly accepted members). The Jiang Zemin and 
Clinton meeting was the first Sino-U.S. summit since February 
1989. Just as Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who is concurrently 
foreign minister, put it, this important meeting was positive 
and constructive. Although they were not talks, it was 
impossible to resolve all of the problems, and neither side 
would change its basic position, it is expected that Sino-U.S. 
relations will improve somewhat. The important significance of 
the meeting lies in defining anew the foundation for improving 
and developing Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Superficially, the aforesaid results of the conference did 
not seem to have made any specific arrangements for the 
Asia-Pacific pattern with the end of the Cold War. We would 
rather say that the conference reflected the concept of the "New 
Pacific Community," and the "Asia-Pacific Economic Community" 
Clinton set forth did not materialize, and this portends the 
surfacing of new contradictions and confrontations which could 
result from the U.S. strengthening its control over the 
Asia-Pacific Region. However, should we analyze the situation 
further, we may find that it was by no means accidental that 
these interrelated measures were all adopted in the short span 
of three or four days. The Seattle APEC Conference has revealed 
the following major tendencies in the world situation with the 
end of the Cold War: 
  1. The role of economic strength has become markedly 
prominent in the balance of international forces. The 
significance of Clinton's new strategy for the Asia-Pacific 
region does not lie in building an Asia-Pacific community within 
a short period (the "Statement on Economic Prospects" issued by 
the Summit was confined to saying "we have conceived the idea of 
building an Asia-Pacific economic community"), but in the change 
from the past U.S. Asia- Pacific strategy based on security and 
bilateral arrangements to a strategy of giving simultaneous 
importance to security and economics and multilateral as well as 
bilateral arrangements. From a contemporary angle, it is 
imperative to give relative prominence to the economy and 
multilateral arrangements because of the excessive attention 
paid to security interests and bilateral arrangements in the 
past. This falls in line with the U.S. goal of reinvigorating 
the economy, and is conducive to the U.S. maintaining its 
leading position and role. From a long-term view, facing the 
challenges of the 21st century cannot be done without exerting 
efforts in achieving new breakthroughs in science and technology 
and economic growth. This being the case, the share of economic 
factors will increase with the development of the situation. 
Clinton's new strategic concept spans the 20th and 21st 
century, and should not be neglected. It will inevitably exert 
effects on the Asia-Pacific and global pattern. 
  2. Weight of Asia-Pacific Region in the global 
balance has markedly increased. The Seattle APEC 
conference has arranged the host countries for the next four 
sessions: Indonesia in 1994; Japan in 1995; the Philippines in 
1996; and Canada in 1997. In addition, the unofficial summit 
decided that a summit would be held in Indonesia. Here, we do 
not have to deal with the sustained growth of the Asia-Pacific 
economy strengthening the region's role in the global position, 
because from the site of the next four sessions, one can see 
that Asia-Pacific will become the central area of global 
concern. We shall wait and see whether or not the unofficial 
summit will become institutionalized, but we can almost be sure 
that the 1994 meeting in Indonesia will be an enthusiastic one, 
and the 1995 meeting in Japan will not be inferior. Thus, an 
Asia-Pacific summit might gradually take shape aside from the 
G-7. The rise of the Asia-Pacific is an irresistible trend, 
which will become a conspicuous characteristic of the post-Cold 
War world. 
  3. China's place and role also show a rising 
trend. Under the circumstance of drastic changes in the 
world situation, China, as a developing socialist power, has 
maintained stability. The success of the policy of reform and 
opening up have brought a high rate of economic growth, which 
has become in increasingly active factor in the Asia-Pacific and 
global situation. While the United States has readjusted its 
Asia-Pacific strategy, it will be very difficult to realize its 
strategic goals in Asia-Pacific without a corresponding 
readjustment in its policy toward China. The evolution of the 
post- war situation in the Asia-Pacific region shows that should 
the United States fail to correctly handle its relations with 
China, it will lose the foundations of its strategy in the 
Asia-Pacific region. It seems that President Clinton has come 
to see this point, and his official meeting with President Jiang 
Zemin was actually a wise move. Obviously, the improvement and 
development of Sino-U.S. relations is where the common interests 
of the two countries lie; furthermore, this not only concerns 
China and the United States by any means, but inevitably has a 
global significance, which is self explanatory. 
  President Jiang Zemin said: "What sort of world will be led 
into the 21st century is an important issue that leading members 
of our generation must earnestly explore and resolve," and he 
added, "we can accomplish something." It seems that the Seattle 
APEC conference has made a positive stride forward in this 
direction.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Mainland 
China became the "largest country in the world in terms of 
absorbing foreign investment" (a term used by World Bank) in 
1993, which attracted worldwide attention. Foreign investments 
in China also had long-term, large-scale, high-tech, and other 
new characteristics and indicated a new trend. According to 
statistics, the number of foreign investment projects in China 
total approximately 100,000, involving agreed-upon capital of 
$110 billion and actual investment of $33 billion. Of this, 
direct investment exceeded $20 billion, an increase of more than 
100 percent over the previous year. Guangdong, which drew the 
largest amount of foreign investment, actually absorbed $8.5 
billion in 1993, accounting for one-fourth of the country's 
total. Shanghai, which ranks second, absorbed $7.016 billion. 
Beijing, which ranks third, absorbed $6.28 billion. Foreign 
investment absorbed by other cities also rose by a wide margin: 
Shenzhen (over $5 billion), Fujian ($2.8 billion), Jiangsu 
($2.2 billion), Shandong ($1.6 billion), Guangxi ($1.06 
billion), and Hainan ($730 million). Even the five northwest 
provinces and autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, 
Ningxia, and Gansu had foreign investment exceeding $5 billion. 
  Hong Kong, which ranked first among foreign countries and 
regions investing in mainland China, invested HK$100 billion 
[Hong Kong dollars] (approximately $13 billion). For example, 
Hopewell, Cheung Kong, Wharf, New World, and other consortia 
invested billions of Hong Kong dollars in mainland China last 
year. In the past, most Hong Kong businessmen focused their 
investment in Guangdong, running small and medium size 
processing enterprises and real estate businesses. The scale of 
their investment was small, and they sought quick returns. Last 
year they joined long-term projects, including power plants, 
highway and urban construction, and development of large pieces 
of land in various provinces. The typical ones include: The 
commercial and residential housing development of Beijing 
Chongwen district invested by the New World Development Company 
Limited; the wharves, stores, and residential projects in Wuhan 
invested by the Wharf (Holdings) Limited; the transformation of 
the "Sanpofang" old district of Fuzhou invested by the Cheung 
Kong (Holdings) Limited; the thermal power plants and 
Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Zhuhai expressway invested by Hopewell 
Holdings Limited; and the retail businesses and department 
stores developed by the Wing On Company International Limited in 
cooperation with the Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited in Beijing, 
Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. 
  Taiwan, which ranked second, invested over $6 billion in 
China, exceeding the sum of the previous years. Taiwan 
investment in the past was focused on light industry which could 
bring quick returns. Last year, Taiwan businessmen focused their 
investment in long-term industries. For example, the Taiwan 
Petroleum Shareholding Company and the Mainland Offshore Oil 
Corporation jointly invested in exploiting oil in the East China 
Sea, and the Taiwan Plastic Holdings agreed to participate in 
projects along the Chang Jiang. 
  U.S., Japanese, and German businessmen also poured in large 
amount of funds in China last year. The Esso Petroleum Company 
[Exxon] of the United States and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation 
signed a contract on exploiting oil in the Tarim basin. It is 
estimated that the total investment will reach billions of 
dollars. Meanwhile, General Motors, Exxon, AT&amp;T, Boeing, and 
Anli [1344 0448] also respectively signed contracts with China 
on a number of projects. Germany's Seimens, Mercedes Benz, and 
Bayer Chemicals and British, French, Italian, and Dutch 
transnational companies including Texco, Suffron, and Shell also 
signed contracts with China on exploiting and developing oil in 
640,000 square km in the East China Sea. In some of the large 
scale projects, there was competition among the Western 
consortia.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia, the United 
States and Ukraine signed here today a tripartite agreement on 
eliminating nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. 
  Well-informed sources told reporters that the accord was 
signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in the Kremlin 
Palace this morning. 
  Meanwhile, the three leaders reaffirmed "the non-nuclear 
status of Ukraine and provided mechanisms of the withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads from Ukraine to Russia, as well as compensation 
to Ukraine for the warheads turned over to Russia," the sources 
said. 
  There are 176 nuclear missiles and about 1,500 warheads in 
the former second-largest Soviet Republic. 
  Yeltsin and Clinton told Kravchuk that "Russia and the 
United 
States will guarantee the security of Ukraine as a non-nuclear 
state," the sources added. 
  The three leaders began their tripartite summit talks at St. 
Catherine's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace at 09:00 a.m., and 
signed the accord in accordance with the results of the talks.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today described as successful U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's first official visit to Russia. 
  At a 50-minute joint news conference held in the press 
center 
of the Foreign Ministry, the Russian president stressed the 
visit was important for the United States as well as for Russia, 
saying it encouraged the "search for new components in the 
relations between the two countries." 
  Yeltsin said that he and Clinton effectively put an end to 
the Cold War in Vancouver and the two countries were now moving 
to "cooperation and partnership." 
  Touching upon the domestic situation in Russia, Yeltsin 
stressed that the adoption of a new constitution and the 
December 12 parliamentary elections were initial signs of 
success of the democratic process of Russia. 
  On December 12, the president said, the Russian people voted 
for "a better life." 
  Yeltsin also told reporters that Russia would keep reform 
going further and strengthen its social stability and peace.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin applauded the evolutionary approach the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) takes in expanding the 
trans-Atlantic security alliance. 
  At a joint press conference with visiting U.S. President 
Bill 
Clinton, Yeltsin said the "Partnership for Peace" plan proposed 
by Washington and endorsed at the NATO summit was "a good 
formula." 
  The practice of accepting one member at a time was "not 
going 
to do anyone good," he added. 
  Clinton, arrived here Thursday on a three-day visit, had 
several meetings with Yeltsin and discussed a wide range of 
issues. 
  They signed a trilateral agreement with Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk on dismantling the 176 nuclear missiles and more 
than 1,500 nuclear warheads Kiev inherited from the former 
Soviet Union. 
  Washington and Moscow also signed an agreement to stop 
targeting their long-range nuclear missiles at each other and 
other nations. 
  On Bosnian issue, Clinton and Yeltsin acknowledged they 
reached "no conclusive results" but said they had had "honest 
and good conversations" on the topic. 
  Trying to lower the expectations of a possible NATO air 
attack on the Bosnian Serbs, Clinton emphasized that the new 
NATO initiative was mainly designed to "further the U.N. 
mission" rather than "pretending" to settle the conflict. 
  With Moscow facing an ailing economy, Clinton urged Russia 
to 
care more about its ordinary citizens and create security net to 
cushion the hardship brought by the economic reform. 
  Stressing that he would press forward with radical economic 
reform, Yeltsin said he had been upset by the slowness in acting 
upon the assistance package agreed upon last July in Tokyo, 
Japan, by the seven major industrialized nations. 
  However, Yeltsin singled out the United States for his words 
of praise, saying most of the 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of aid 
Clinton promised in Vancouver, Canada, in March of last year, 
have been delivered. 
  Clinton was quick to add that the G-7 will speed up the pace 
in helping Russia, saying Moscow's willingness to continue the 
reform "will be met positively" by the West. 
  "Billions of dollars" of Western aid will flow to Russia in 
years ahead, he promised. 
  This is Clinton's first trip to Europe since he took office 
a 
year ago. His later stops will be Minsk, Belarus, and Geneva, 
Switzerland, where he is to meet with Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad on the Middle East peace talks. 
  He is expected to make two more trips to Europe later this 
year, including participating in this year's G-7 meeting in 
Naples, Italy, in July. 
  Clinton has invited Yeltsin to join him in Naples and to 
visit Washington this fall.

  [Text] Asmara, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Eritrean President 
Isayas Afewerki held friendly talks here today with visiting 
Chinese Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen . 
  During the talks, Afewerki said Qian's visit is an 
indication 
of the importance China attaches to Eritrea and to the friendly 
relations between the two countries. 
  The Eritrean Government pursues the policy of enhancing 
cooperation with China in various fields, the president 
stressed, saying the cooperation is in the interest of the 
Eritrean people and helps promote peace and development of 
Africa. 
  Eritrea is now facing the task of full-scale reconstruction 
after 30 years of war and it expects assistance from China, the 
president added. 
  Qian conveyed to Afewerki the greetings of Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. He told Afewerki that Jiang 
expects him to visit China at an early date so that the 
bilateral relations be pushed to a higher level. 
  The Chinese vice-premier said the trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries has had a good start 
following the establishment of diplomatic ties months ago. 
  It is in the interest of the two peoples that the Chinese 
Government and Eritrean Government work together to enhance 
mutual exchanges and bilateral cooperation, Qian stressed. 
  Afewerki briefed Qian on the situation in the horn of 
Africa. 
He said maintenance of the regional peace, together with 
development of economy and elimination of poverty and 
backwardness, are the major tasks facing Eritrea. 
  The two leaders agreed that the development of economy is 
the 
basis of solutions to many problems in the African continent.

  [Text] Asmara, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Eritrean foreign 
minister and his visiting Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen held 
talks here today and exchanged views on the bilateral relations 
and the world affairs as well as the issue of the horn of Africa. 
  On the bilateral relations, Sharifo said, Eritrea and China 
had shared good relations before its independence in May last 
year, adding that the cooperation between the two countries has 
been promoted since the independence of Eritrea. 
  He expressed the hope that the governments of the two 
countries will continue to strengthen the cooperation and 
Eritrea welcomes Chinese entrepreneurs to participate in 
rehabilitating the economy in Eritrea. 
  Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said that 
China treasures the good relations between the two countries and 
is willing to strengthen various form of cooperation on the 
basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
  On international situation, Qian Qichen said after the end 
of 
the Cold War, the world situation is relaxed on the whole, but 
it is not all well. Various contradictions and conflicts are 
continuing, and in particular, the developing countries are 
facing many new difficulties and challenges. For them, the most 
important task now is to safeguard their sovereignty and develop 
their economies. 
  On the Somali issue, Sharifo briefed Qian Qichen on the 
efforts Eritrea has made in seeking solutions to the Somali 
problem. 
  He said the Somali problem should be solved by the Somali 
people themselves. Meanwhile, the Organization of the African 
Unity and other African countries should play an important role 
in solving the Somali issue. 
  Qian Qichen hailed the efforts Eritrea has made in promoting 
the peace process in Somalia. He also spoke highly of Eritrea's 
policy of "peace, non-aligned and good neighborliness." 
  On the issue of Eritrea itself, Sharifo said his country is 
facing a heavy task to revive and develop its economy that was 
seriously destroyed by the 30-year-long war. He said that the 
experience of success in China is very important to the 
developing countries including Eritrea. He said Eritrea would 
draw on the experience of China. 
  Qian Qichen said Eritrea is pursuing the policies of 
national 
unity and rapid restoration of the economy. He expressed his 
conviction that Eritrea would be successful in rehabilitating 
and developing its economy. As to China's experience, he said, 
some may be suitable to Eritrea. Learning others experience 
must be based on a country's actual conditions.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 14 (AFP)--Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin welcomed Friday the resumption of normal relations between 
France and China and praised the foresight of Mao Zedong and 
former French president Charles de Gaulle in establishing ties 
30 years ago, a diplomatic source said. 
  Jiang made the remarks during a half-hour meeting with the 
new French ambassador, Francois Marcel Plaisant, who was 
presenting his credentials. 
  Plaisant was given the rare privilege of being received 
privately by the head of state. Normally a brief ceremony is 
held at which several ambassadors present their credentials at 
the same time. 
  Paris and Beijing issued a joint statement Wednesday 
normalising their relations and in which France undertook not to 
sell arms to Taiwan. Beijing claims sovereignty over the 
nationalist island. 
  Relations between Paris and Beijing had been in the doldrums 
for more than 14 months following France's decision to sell 
Mirage 2000- 5 jets to Taipei. 
  Jiang, who is also general secretary of the communist party, 
said that he admired French skills in the economic and 
technology fields, the diplomatic source added. 
  He also evoked the upcoming visit of French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur to China, expected to take place next month, 
and an official visit to France by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen. 
  Qian is currently on a tour of east Africa and is expected 
to 
visit Paris at the end of January.

relations between reform, development, and stability to ensure 
overall fulfillment of this year's reform and construction 
tasks. At the meeting Yan Haiwang expressed his views on 
implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and the Eighth Provincial CPC Congress, on 
deepening reform and expediting development, and on making a 
success of this year's economic work. 
  The first is clearly understanding the situation and 
changing 
ideas to cope with development of the socialist market economy. 
The second is giving prominence to key points, resolving 
difficulties, and maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the economy. The third is making overall 
progress, breaking through focal points, and speeding up 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The 
fourth is having a thorough idea of the situation, strengthening 
leadership, and ensuring the smooth carrying out of reform and 
construction. 
  Yan Haiwang said: This year the state will make a major move 
in financial, taxation, monetary, planning, investment, and 
foreign trade reforms. We should unswervingly implement the 
reform measures promulgated by the state. Facing new tasks and 
a new situation in reform and construction, we should have new 
ideas for development, create new structures, and change our 
concepts. At present, we should break the old, traditional 
concept of a planned economy and cultivate a new concept of a 
market economy. We should free ourselves from the binds of 
planned economic operation and management methods, establish a 
new concept in which economic and legal means as well as the 
necessary administrative methods are applied to economic 
management, correctly handle relations between markets and 
plans, cultivate a mentality which dialectically integrates 
microeconomic invigoration and macroeconomic control and 
regulation, overcome the idea of inertia, and foster the idea of 
being bold in taking risks. 
  Yan Haiwang pointed out: In this year's economic work, there 
is a need to strengthen the position of agriculture as the 
foundation, to bring about overall development in the rural 
economy, to switch our economic work to improving economic 
results, to increase the impetus of economic structural 
adjustment, to adjust the orientation of capital injection, to 
ensure the carrying out of key construction projects, and to 
improve investment results. 
  Yan Haiwang stressed: In this year's reform, our province 
should make breakthroughs in these three aspects: The first is 
making a breakthrough in the ownership structural adjustment; 
the second is actively and steadily establishing a new 
enterprise system; and the third is conscientiously implementing 
all macrocontrol and regulatory policies to promote our 
province's reform to a new period and scale a new height in 
economic construction. 
  The meeting was presided over by Acting Governor Zhang Wule.

  [Excerpts] At a provincial economic work meeting in 
Lanzhou yesterday morning, Acting Governor Zhang Wule pointed 
out the need to meet the demands of the new situation and to 
adopt effective measures to comprehensively carry forward all 
kinds of reforms and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of Gansu's economy. 
  Zhang Wule said: Last year, encouraged by Deng Xiaoping's 
southern tour talks and the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, the people throughout the province, taking account of 
Gansu's actual conditions, implemented the decision of the party 
Central Committee on macrocontrol and regulation, took effective 
measures, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and fulfilled the 
objectives set by the provincial party committee and government 
at the beginning of last year. The general situation is good. 
This year is the last year to fulfill the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan, a crucial year to expedite the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure, and a year to start with 
the implementation of the decision of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The state will introduce 
major reforms to the financial, taxation, monetary, planning, 
investment, foreign trade, and price systems. [passage omitted] 
  Zhang Wule pointed out that in this new situation, the 
government has three main tasks to perform: The first is 
ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and 
improving Gansu's productivity; the second is making efforts to 
improve the masses' lives on the basis of economic development; 
and the third is upholding the two civilizations and striving to 
maintain a good mood and basic stability in society. In line 
with these three basic tasks, there is a need to ensure a steady 
growth in the rural economy; to develop rural industries, 
township and town enterprises, tertiary industries, collective 
economic sectors, individual economic sectors, and private 
economic sectors; to widen the scope of opening; to carry out 
technical transformation; to expedite the transformation of 
scientific and technological achievements into actual productive 
forces; to strengthen enterprise management; and to bring about 
the gradual formation of a modern enterprise system. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The leading group for anticorruption operations of 
the provincial party committee called a meeting yesterday 
afternoon to arrange an inspection of the province-wide 
anticorruption operation. The meeting was presided over by Vice 
Governor Liu Guanghe. Provincial party committee Secretary Yin 
Kesheng and other leading comrades from other sectors concerned, 
including Doba, Ma Yougong, and Zhang Jimin, attended the 
meeting. 
  According to the plan formulated at the meeting, the 
provincial party committee and provincial government will 
dispatch 10 inspection groups to carry out an inspection of the 
performance of some autonomous prefectures, prefectures, cities, 
and some organs directly under the provincial authorities in the 
three stages of the anticorruption operation. 
  During the meeting, Secretary Yin Kesheng presented his 
opinions on how to make this forthcoming inspection a success. 
He first demanded that all comrades accurately estimate the 
current situation in the anticorruption operation. He noted: 
Since the start of the anticorruption operation last August, 
all localities and departments have taken action to launch the 
operation in light of local circumstances. Initial success has 
been achieved in those localities and departments which have 
performed well. Generally speaking, the operation is following 
a good line. Cadres at and above the county and office level in 
party and government organs have made self-assessments against 
the five requirements of honesty and self-discipline, and have 
begun to correct their mistakes on their own. In light of the 
present state that our leading cadres are taking the initiative 
in practicing honesty and self-discipline, 10 stipulations and a 
series of rules have been adopted, banning cadres from accepting 
cash rewards and demanding that leading cadres minimize social 
appointments. Now it is found that most cadres in this province 
have been devoted to public duty and exerted themselves to meet 
the requirements. However, we also must be clearly aware that 
we have only achieved initial success in the ongoing 
anticorruption operation, which is still much short of the 
public's expectation. And the performance varies from locality 
to locality and from department to department. Some localities 
and departments have not been firm enough in their attitude and 
down-to-earth enough in their work, and what they have done 
still is quite superficial, while other localities and 
departments, being afraid of exposing real problems, have tried 
to play down some key issues, practice favoritism, and cover up 
some major important cases. Their wrong attitude and practices 
which have directly affected the progress of the anticorruption 
operation must be resolutely corrected. In the anticorruption 
operation in the future, all localities and departments must 
further strengthen leadership, try very hard to perform their 
duties, and make sustained efforts to carry out the 
anticorruption operation in depth. 
  Yin Kesheng expressed his hope that all the major leading 
bodies at the provincial level would set store by the 
forthcoming inspection and appoint comrades of good quality with 
strong senses of responsibility to fill the inspection groups. 
All the inspection groups must pursue the principle of seeking 
truth from facts, going deep into the grass-roots level, being 
adept at soliciting opinions from among the public, and daring 
to deal with knotty problems and to expose real problems; never 
should they render the inspection a mere show. 
  Yin Kesheng asserted: The most important points that one 
must 
bear in mind in the anticorruption operation are that one must 
do it in real earnest and in a persistent spirit. Party and 
government departments at all levels definitely must do the work 
in a down-to-earth and effective manner so as to win the 
public's trust.

  [Text] Xining, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Qinghai Province, one of the country's most backward areas, saw 
a big increase in its exports in the past year. 
  According to local foreign trade officials, in 1993 the 
province clinched 101.74 million U.S. dollars in exports, 
fulfilling the state-set export quota for the province and also 
representing an increase of 12.51 percent over the previous year. 
  The officials attributed the initial success chiefly to the 
fact that relevant local departments helped export-oriented 
enterprises solve difficulties and some practical problems. 
Foreign trade departments also strived to make a success of the 
export of the province's traditional products, such as carpets 
and ferrosilicon, while endeavoring to develop new commodities 
in greater varieties for export. 
  So far, the province has 30 specialized foreign trade, 
economic and technical cooperation companies, and has 
established stable trade relations with more than 40 countries 
and regions in the world. The variety of commodities for export 
has increased from only nine kinds in 1980 to the present 120 
kinds in 12 categories.

  [Text] On the morning of 8 January, the provincial 
taxation bureau held a news briefing to announce the results of 
tax reform to press units as well as relevant enterprises and 
departments. It also analyzed the impact of tax reform on 
production and opertaion of Qinghai enterprises. 
  The State Council decided to introduce tax reform throughout 
the country beginning 1 January this year. It is a 
comprehensive and overall structural reform. The purpose of 
this reform is to establish a new taxation system which 
corresponds with China's national conditions and international 
practice, gives expression to market economic demands, is 
beneficial to macrocontrol and regulation, and is favorable to 
economic development. To ensure the smooth implementation of 
the new taxation system in Qinghai, taxation departments in the 
province have run many training courses since October last year 
for taxation cadres, factory directors and managers, as well as 
financial and taxation personnel. These training courses have 
enabled most taxation cadres to understood the importance of the 
current taxation system reform and the main content of this 
reform. 
  Now a new taxation system is being implemented. Because the 
current taxation system reform involves a wide range of work and 
is being carried out on a large scale, taxation departments in 
the province have conducted propaganda among the people. But 
some people still think that the introduction of this new 
measure will cause price hikes. Some individual traders have 
also raised their commodity prices, and this has caused 
unhealthy results. 
  A person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau 
explained: The current taxation system reform is mainly aimed at 
adjusting the tax structure, but the overall tax rate is not 
rising. In a socialist market economy, organizing revenue for 
the state still remains the most important and basic task. As 
the state is facing financial difficulties at present, 
delegating powers to the lower levels and allowing more profit 
retention for them are difficult to avoid. Therefore taxation 
system reform is conducive to strengthening the central 
authorities' macrocontrol and regulatory ability and is 
beneficial to increasing the two proportions [expansion unknown]. 
  The current taxation system reform will, in varying degrees, 
cause a change in the composition of tax sources and revenues. 
To put it more specifically, revenues will change between tax 
categories, revenues in different tax categories will increase 
or decrease, and taxation rates in different trades will also 
increase or decrease. Naturally, taxation rates in different 
enterprises will increase or decrease, too. All these are 
normal, and this kind of structural adjustment is inevitable. 
Merging some old tax categories, adopting some new tax 
categories, and reforming some of the existing tax categories so 
that categories and sources will change and tax collections from 
different trades will also change are structural adjustments 
which will not affect the total volume of taxation. Therefore, 
taken as a whole, the total volume of taxation will not 
increase, thus, enterprises' tax burden will not increase, 
either.

returned overseas Chinese and the relatives of overseas Chinese 
in Beijing will be better protected thanks to the new 
regulations approved by the Standing Committee of the Municipal 
People's Congress today. 
  The new regulations embody the principles of the national

their rights in dealing with personal property. 
  The regulations go into detail on the issue of the private 
houses, one of the greatest concerns of the returned overseas 
Chinese and their relatives, and formulate some preferential 
policies for them. 
  The regulations have outlined a number of special policies 
to

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Szu-hua (2621 1835 5478): "Zhu Entao </F>
Says China Will Resolutely Crack Down on Triads But Welcomes 
Those Who Mend Their Ways"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--When meeting the 
visiting delegation from the Royal Hong Kong Police Local 
Inspectors' Association in Beijing today, Zhu Entao, director of 
China's National Central Bureau of Interpol, reiterated that the 
Chinese Government takes a resolute stance in cracking down on 
underworld crime. However, the Chinese Government also welcomes 
those underworld elements who have turned over a new leaf with 
actual good conduct. 
  Zhu Entao also told the association that the Chinese 
Government will not under any circumstances send public security 
police to work in the police force of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] or recruit personnel from the 
mainland after 1997. 
  At the meeting, Zhu exchanged views with the visiting group 
on police affairs in Hong Kong and the mainland. Touching on 
the underworld problem, Zhu reiterated that it is the Chinese 
Government's consistent stand to strike resolutely at underworld 
crimes and to prevent underworld elements from developing their 
organizations on the mainland. They will be resolutely banned 
the moment they are unearthed. If underworld elements from Hong 
Kong commit crimes on the mainland, they will certainly be 
handled according to the law. It is absolutely impossible for 
them to seek refuge on the mainland after committing crimes in 
Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Zhu Entao said that if they have corrected 
their conduct with good concrete performances, the Chinese 
Government definitely welcomes them. 
  As to the recent cooperation between the two sides regarding 
the crackdown on crimes, such as the yachts stolen in Hong Kong, 
Zhu said the mainland side has paid close attention to the 
problem and is now studying countermeasures for that. 
  In addition, Zhu Entao also explained to the association 
that 
the Hong Kong Police will still be accountable to the SAR 
government after 1997. If there is a police manpower shortage, 
this is also an affair for the SAR government and the police 
commissioner. The Chinese Government will under no 
circumstances send public security personnel or recruit 
policemen to work in Hong Kong. He maintained that this is a 
major Chinese Government principle to realize Hong Kong being 
ruled by the Hong Kong people.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Another 50,000 
specialists, scholars and technicians have been selected to 
receive special government allowances for their marked 
contributions last year, according to officials with the 
Ministry of Personnel. 
  China began to grant special government allowances to 
outstanding experts in 1990. By the end of last year, nearly 
110,000 experts had been granted allowances. 
  Compared to those selected before, there are more young 
people among those selected this time, and many of them are 
engaged closely in agriculture, industry and technological 
popularization. 
  The officials said the allowance program helps encourage 
hard 
working people and thus intensifies people's respect for 
knowledge and professionally capable personnel. 
  The state will continue to carry out the program with the 
improvement of relevant regulations and concrete measures, the 
officials said.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Studies of Northern Ethnic Minorities Make </F>
Headway"] 
  [Text] Hohhot, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China has made major 
headway in the research of the history of its many northern 
region ethnic minorities, marked by the publishing of many new 
and important research works and the deepening of the extent of 
research. 
  Since 1985, Chinese scholars have completed such voluminous 
works as "The General History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in 
Northern China", "The General History of Mongols", "The History 
of the Relations Between Northern Ethnic Minorities" and "The 
Cultural History of Northern Ethnic Minorities". 
  Three books by Lin Gan, the noted scholar of ethnic 
minorities -- "The General History of Xiongnu", "The History of 
Donghu" and "The History of Tujue" -- have roused the attention 
of historians, as it cleared up the western migration line of 
the north Xiongnu, the tribal institution of the western Xiongnu 
and the activities of the early Donghu people, all of which 
previously posed major difficulties for historians. 
  In his latest work, "New Points About the Ethnic Minorities 
in Northern China", Lin explored the relations between the 
northern minorities and the Hans in central China, the 
assimilation of the minorities by the Hans and the origin of the 
northern tribes and pushed the research of such significant 
issues to a new height. 
  The history of northern China's ethnic minorities has been a 
topic of great interest to the international historical society. 
Since some 2,000 years ago, in the wide region ranging from the 
northeastern to northwestern ends of China, there have existed 
dozens of ethnic minorities. While many of them, such as the 
Qidan, Nuzhen and Xiongnu, had established their own regimes, 
the Mongols eventually united all of China and started the Yuan 
Dynasty (1279-1368). 
  The history of the northern ethnic minorities is an 
important 
part of the history of China as well as that of the world. 
  In its earlier period starting from the mid-18th century to 
late 1940s, research of the northern ethnic minorities had 
resulted in the publishing of fewer than 200 papers. 
  The 1950s saw the beginning of a new era for the research. 
The three decades thereafter produced many important scholars 
and works, with Ma Changshou and his works on the history of the 
Xiongnu and Tujue as the representatives. 
  The period from the early 1980s represents a golden time in 
Chinese ethnic studies. Publications of the period include 49 
research works, 26 collections of research papers, 12 
collections of historical documents, the Chinese version of 19 
works by authors from Russia, Iran, France and Japan, as well as 
12 books on archaeological discoveries in the region and how 
they reflect on northern ethnic minorities. 
  Based on the findings of an extensive social and historical 
investigation, scholars have completed the histories of major 
nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including 
the Mongols, the Daur, Oroqen and Ewenki. 
  Besides the writing of two books on the history of the 
Mongols, Chinese scholars of Mongolian history also published 
hundreds of research papers in the period. 
  Of these works, the one of the greatest value is the Chinese 
version of the "Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty", translated 
into Chinese by Professor Yi Linzhen from the University of 
Inner Mongolia. 
  Besides providing numerous annotations based on the 
knowledge 
of voluminous ancient documents, Yi has also written a lengthy 
foreword in the Chinese and Mongolian languages for the 
classical historical work written in ancient Mongolian language 
in the 13th century. 
  The work has been partly translated into Japanese and 
published in Japan. 
  In the latest development, a work by the title of "The 
Cultural History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in North China" 
has been completed by scholars from nine Chinese regions and 
recently published. The book, containing 1.2 million Chinese 
characters, represents the first systematic cultural research of 
the northern nationalities from the angles of folklore, 
archaeology, history, comparative linguistics and art.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--An official 
concerned of the China Press and Publications Administration 
said that in 1993, the number of registered newspapers openly 
published in China had reached 2,039. The total issues and 
pages of newspapers printed in the first half of the year were 
respectively five and 18 percent more than those of the same 
period in the previous year, setting a record high. 
  At present, more than 700 newspapers have adopted laser 
photo- composition technology. The advertisement business of 
newspapers has also developed rapidly and income from 
advertisements of more than 10 newspapers exceeded 100 million 
yuan each in 1993. 
  This official pointed out that with the prosperity of 
newspapers, some partial problems and symptoms of undesirable 
tendencies have also emerged. Some newspapers have made false 
reports, replaced news information with created or fabricated 
stories, and cheated the readers by using "Mr. A and Mr. B" and 
"City A and City B" to evade the tests of truth of the 
information. Some are still using various ways to publish "paid 
news reports." Others have made use of the "weekend editions" 
or the "enlarged editions" in pursuit of "market effects," 
paying no attention to social benefits and doing harm to readers 
with low-taste and bad-style reports, articles, and photos 
written or prepared in a rough and slipshod way. Still others 
have damaged publication order and the market of newspapers and 
magazines, seriously violated state laws, decrees, regulations, 
and rules, irresponsibly used false information of overseas 
media, and even made mistakes in political issues and guidance 
for public opinion. These problems should attract the attention 
of all newspapers throughout the country and should be corrected.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The State Economic 
and Trade Commission, State Administration of Taxation and 
General Administration of Customs have issued a set of temporary 
regulations to encourage and support large enterprises and 
enterprise groups to set up technical centers. 
  Forty large enterprises and enterprise groups have been 
listed as the first batch of enterprises in the country to enjoy 
preferential treatment in adopting the enterprise technical 
center system. These include Jilin Chemical Industrial 
Corporation, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, Yatai Enterprise 
Group of Chemicals for Agricultural Use, and the China Great 
Wall Computer Enterprise Group. 
  According to the regulations, the listed enterprises will be 
exempted from taxation in importing meters and instruments, 
chemical reagents and technical data, which China is not yet 
able to produce, for their technical centers to develop new 
technology. The products in trial production developed by their 
technical centers will be exempted from income taxes for a 
certain period. The technical centers also enjoy some other 
preferential treatments. 
  Different from most developed countries, China used to 
separate research institutes of applied technology from 
enterprises. Experts noted that the new practice will promote 
the integration of research with production, thus accelerating 
the process of research and application of new technology.

  [Text] China will hold more seminars to map out the 
strategic development of scientific research in the next century. 
  The Xiang Shan Conference, an annual high-level scientific 
meeting held in the Xiang Shan (Fragrant Hills) outside Beijing, 
will organize about 20 seminars this year compared with eight 
last year when it was first initiated and sponsored by the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences for discussing the direction of 
scientific research. 
  "The conference aims at foreseeing the development of 
frontier sciences, especially cross-discipline sciences," said 
Cao Xiaoye, of the organizing committee. 
  Cao said the organizing committee is requesting suggestions 
on seminar subjects nationwide. The first seminar this year is 
expected to be held in April. 
  Any Chinese scientists can apply to host or attend the 
conference. 
  "Foreign scientists and Chinese scientists working or 
studying abroad are also eligible to apply," Cao said. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is 
considering inviting some Nobel Prize winners to address the 
conference this year or next year. 
  The conference is part of the effort to make China one of 
the 
scientific powerhouses in the world. 
  Cao said that China has many good scientists, but needs some 
leading scientists who are capable of guiding the country's 
scientific research. 
  "Our conference is targeted at opening the minds of 
scientists and nurturing a group of leading scientists," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- China can now 
forecast weather five or six days ahead, compared with only 
three or four days in the past, Wen Kegang, deputy chief of the 
China Meteorological Administration said here today. 
  Last year's start of operation of a numerical weather 
prediction system, which uses an advanced Yinhe-II computer, 
made the increased forecast capacity possible. 
  China also set up the first continental global atmosphere 
watch observatory last year in Qinghai Province, which is 
expected to be operational soon. 
  Officials say the observatory will enable China to monitor 
the atmosphere, including the ozone layer and acid rain. 
  The observatory, which is officially known as China Global 
Atmosphere Watch Baseline Observatory (CGAW) was constructed 
with cooperation from the World Meteorological Organization. 
  The National Satellite Meteorological Center is now building 
the ground segment for Fengyun-2 Meteorological Satellite to be 
launched. 
  The satellite will be China's first geostationary 
meteorological satellite.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have developed a new technological process for dressing tailings 
of ferrous metal ores, which is said to be internationally 
advanced. 
  The process has passed state appraisal and been patented. 
  Experts noted that the technological process will play an 
important role in saving and more effectively utilizing mineral 
resources. 
  The new process was developed by the Benxi Iron and Steel 
Company's Waitoushan iron ore mine in northeast China's Liaoning 
Province. After years of efforts, scientists at the mine 
developed a magnetic plant and a technological process including 
milling and concentrating, which is of low cost and without 
pollution. By using the equipment and the technological 
process, iron and steel works can recover low-content magnetic 
iron ore powder from the slurry of tailings. 
  With trial use of the new equipment and technological 
process, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has recovered over 30,000 
tons of iron ore concentrates with the grade rate reaching as 
high as 65 percent, making 1.5 million yuan profits. 
  Most of the ferrous metal ores in China are low grade ones. 
During the process of the usual magnetic dressing, about seven 
percent of the iron ore concentrates is cast away with the 
tailings. At present, China has over 30 large magnetic dressing 
plants, which cast away over 54 million tons of tailings slurry. 
  If the newly-developed technological process is adopted by 
all the large magnetic dressing plants throughout the country, a 
total of 1.3 million tons of iron ore concentrates will be 
recovered, thus earning more than 200 million yuan a year.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Shanghai Deepens Scientific Reform"] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai will boost 
its economy by deepening the reform of management in the fields 
of science and technology this year. 
  "While maintaining a small number of capable scientists to 
continue their work at research institutions, the municipal 
government is encouraging most research workers to apply their 
talents to the market-oriented economy and turn their research 
findings into commodities," a local official explained. 
  He noted that the Shanghai government will provide a more 
flexible social environment for them to display their talents in 
the market both at home and abroad. 
  In addition, research institutions are expected to 
streamline 
their structures by setting up more productive economic entities 
in the form of companies with responsibility for their own 
profits and losses. 
  Such companies will be entitled to raise their own funds, 
transfer or purchase property rights, and annex small businesses. 
  In addition, they will pave the way for the further 
development of the technology market. 
  A survey shows that Shanghai has 269 independent scientific 
research institutions, employing about 900,000 scientists and 
technicians. 
  Until 1985, under the old central planning system, all the 
funds for research institutions were allocated by the central 
government, which assigned research tasks. Scientific workers 
concentrated on their studies and paid little attention to 
whether their research findings were put into practice or not. 
  "In those days we were told what to do, and had little say 
in 
the outcome," a scientist said. "But the new policy has given an 
enormous boost to the morale and enthusiasm of scientific 
workers," he acknowledged. 
  Last year saw Shanghai's 269 independent scientific research 
institutions earn a record total of four billion yuan. 
  According to the latest figures, Shanghai has more than 
5,000 
enterprises specializing in the development of science and 
technology, including 60 Sino-foreign joint ventures. 
  These enterprises are engaged in such major industries as 
automobiles, telecommunications equipment, computer software, 
bioengineering and pharmaceuticals. 
  Zhu Jiping, a leading official of the Shanghai Commission 
for 
Science and Technology, said, "In the new situation Shanghai's 
scientific work must focus on economic and social development. 
In fact it should guide the municipal economic growth as a 
whole." 
  Shanghai's scientific workers developed 1,995 research 
findings last year, 734 of which reached or approached the 
advanced world standards. 
  The Shanghai Technology Exchange, which does business 
nationwide, concluded transactions topping two billion yuan in 
value last year.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Years of effort to 
develop technology markets have successfully speeded up the 
commercialization of new- and high-technology in east China's 
Zhejiang Province. 
  Official statistics show that from 1992 to the end of 1993 
more than 27,000 technological contracts had been signed, with a 
total business volume of over 800 million yuan (about 91.95 
million U.S. dollars)-worth. 
  Through these markets, the latest research findings have 
been 
spread all over the country and have been applied to production, 
resulting in a remarkable increase in profits. 
  For instance, a computer designing system for silk spinning 
traded on the technology market has already brought more than 
700 million yuan (about 80.5 million U.S. dollars) in increased 
profits to those firms which have applied it to production. 
  A centrifugal ventilator invented by researchers at Zhejiang 
university has been applied in over 20 cities throughout the 
country and has created more than one billion yuan (about 115 
million U.S. dollars) in profit. 
  Local officials said that they are developing the technology 
market "in a bid to commercialize and spread new- and high- 
technology nationwide". 
  This is also the best way to optimize the uneven allocation 
of technological forces, which has hindered the development of 
both scientific technology and the economy as a whole, they said. 
  Meanwhile, the province has held a number of training 
classes 
in the operation of technology markets and technological 
contracts. 
  Administration offices have been established in the 
meantime, 
in an effort to control the markets and remove trade barriers. 
  With the improvement of the markets and policies, the 
province has witnessed a boom in science and technology 
development and has made remarkable progress in applying 
research findings to production. 
  According to officials from the provincial technology market 
coordination and direction office, many items of high-technology 
have been sold to foreign businesses.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Huang Qiusheng (7806 4428 3932)] 
  [Excerpts] Nanjing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- Under the new 
situation marked by reform, opening up, and development of a 
socialist market economy, people in five provinces and one 
municipality in eastern China, while launching reform and 
opening up projects, have also been eagerly supporting the 
military. [passage omitted] Recently, Nanjing Military Region 
Commander Gu Hui and Political Commissar Fang Zuqi [2455 4371 
1477] presented golden plaques -- engraved with characters: 
"good logistics supporters of the military" -- to 13 units, 
including the Fujian Provincial Government office in charge of 
support-the-front affairs. 
  One common understanding shared by party and government 
departments of Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Anhui, and 
Jiangsu in eastern China is that they must intensify their 
support for the military at a time when efforts are being made 
to speed up the pace of reform, opening up, and the development 
of the socialist market economy. [passage omitted] Whenever a 
major reform project was going to be launched, the local party 
committees and governments always considered the military's 
tolerance for a change first. In April 1993 after the state 
decontrolled the grain market, the grain departments of these 
provinces and Shanghai, in order to ensure the military's grain 
supply, immediately set up 20 supply departments and hundreds of 
supply depots in cities and regions where garrison troops were 
concentrated and sold them quality grain at preferential prices 
on a priority basis. Despite rising grain prices, the Shanghai 
Municipal Government's office in charge of financial affairs and 
trade did everything it could to sell 200,000 tonnes of grain to 
the garrison troops at set prices. [passage omitted]

"Various Central Departments Held A Joint Meeting; Qian Qichen 
Appointed Deputy Head of Central Leading Group for Taiwan 
Affairs; There Will Be More Contacts with Various Political 
Parties and Factions in Taiwan"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--An athoritative source 
here revealed that Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State 
Council, was recently appointed deputy head of the Central 
Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs. This shows that the central 
authorities will further speed up the pace of peaceful 
reunification of the two sides of the strait by strengthening 
the roles of international contacts. 
  The source said that when talking about the work concerning 
Taiwan affairs some days ago, a high-level central leader 
emphasized the necessity of gaining a realistic understanding of 
the new changes in Taiwan's current situation, such as the 
resignations of senior party, government, and military leaders 
of the older generation and the fact that the second generation 
of leaders are in power. The new generation of leaders are 
different from the senior leaders of the older generation in 
their relations with the mainland. The leaders of the older 
generation have a thousand and one links with the mainland but 
have a stronger anti-communist sense. The leaders of the second 
generation have fewer links with the mainland and also a weak 
anti-communist sense. Instead, they have a stronger sense of 
being content to exercise sovereignty over a part of the 
country. We cannot say that they are all advocating "Taiwan 
independence." 
  The high-level central leader held that under the new 
situation, work concerning Taiwan does not mean mere contacts 
with the Kuomintang [KMT]. It is necessary to contact various 
political parties and factions in Taiwan, including the 
Democratic Progressive Party. The central leader reiterated the 
following three principles will never change in work concerning 
Taiwan: The principle that there is only one China; the 
principle of resolving the Taiwan issue in a form of "one 
country, two systems"; and the principle of not promising to 
give up forces in resolving the Taiwan issue, especially under 
the situation that foreign powers are interfering in Taiwan's 
internal affairs or when separation or independence issues 
appear in Taiwan. 
  Referring to the development of cross-strait economic 
relations and trade, the central leader said: Judging from 
current developments, as some big projects invested by Taiwanese 
businessmen are not coordinated with the planning and deployment 
of the central authorities and the relevant departments in 
charge do not have effective coordination mechanisms and 
corresponding policies, making the approval procedures rather 
complicated and time-consuming, there are still difficulties for 
Taiwanese businessmen to come to invest in the mainland. These 
are also problems to be resolved. 
  The following are decisions made by a recent joint meeting 
of 
various central departments concerned, which was presided over 
by the high-level central leader: 
  1. A national conference on economic work relating to Taiwan 
will be held this coming spring to work out special documents on 
some special subjects, the substantive contents of which have 
been discussed many times. 
  2. It is proposed that a coordination group for economic 
relations and trade with Taiwan is established under the State 
Council. 
  3. To adopt "preferential and special policies on special 
issues" toward Taiwanese businessmen. In comparison with the 
existing policies on foreign investment, more preferential 
treatment will be given to Taiwanese investors. In some spheres 
the policies can be further relaxed, and there will be no 
restrictions on some projects regarding their distribution and 
planning. 
  4. To work out laws to protect Taiwanese investors. 
  5. To agree in principle to the establishment of 
Taiwan-funded banks; to satisfy as far as possible the needs of 
Taiwan-funded enterprises for funds in terms of the renminbi. 
  6. To make positive efforts to promote cross-strait 
cooperation in the fields of science and technology and 
agriculture and encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in 
mainland agricultural production. For example, when they have 
invested in establishment of farms to produce grain, the 
issuance of export licenses will be taken into consideration. 
  7. On the issue of export of labor to Taiwan, a unified 
policy will be worked out by the State Council's Taiwan Affairs 
Office and the matter will be taken care by the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] in a unified 
way. The ARATS [Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait] will be authorized to consult and sign contracts with 
the other side, and concrete affairs will be handled by 
qualified labor companies. MOFTEC [Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation] will not handle concrete affairs 
concerning labor exports to Taiwan.

Cross- Straits Economics Talks"] 
  [Text] Mainland and Taiwan negotiators are to meet in 
Beijing on January 31 to discuss cross-straits economic and 
other non- political issues, it was revealed yesterday. 
  Chiao Jen-ho, Vice-Chairman of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (Sef) is expected to lead a delegation to hold talks 
with Tang Shubei, Vice-Chairman of the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (Arats). 
  They will be the highest-level talks the semi-official 
bodies 
have had since last April's landmark "Wang-Koo" meeting in 
Singapore between Arats and Sef heads Wang Daohan and Koo 
Chen-fu. 
  Tang Shubei told a press conference in Beijing that the 
five-day talks are expected to clear the way for the second 
"summit" between Wang and Koo. 
  They will also talk about ways the two bodies can 
co-operate. 
  Tang hoped his meeting with Chiao would settle matters 
concerning the second Wang-Koo meeting and set the starting date 
for talks on economics, science and technology. 
  He said there was no need to set a precondition that the two 
sides reach and sign an agreement. 
  Tang's planned trip to Taiwan late last month had to be 
cancelled, as mainland and Taiwan negotiators failed to agree on 
repatriation of mainland hijackers in a round of working talks 
in Taibei. 
  Also at yesterday's news conference, Arats Chairman Wang 
Daohan told journalists he hoped to meet Koo Chen-fu soon, 
adding that topIevel meetings between the two organizations will 
benefit cross- straits relations. 
  The second meeting will probably take place in Beijing. 
  Arats and Sef officials agreed in Singapore last April that 
their meetings should be regular and frequent. 
  Both believed high-level contacts would increase exchanges 
and mutual trust. 
  Wang also said there was no need for his association to set 
up a liaison office in Hong Kong or Taibei, but he said that 
ways to strengthen contacts between Arats and Sef could be 
discussed. 
  Yesterday's news conference came shortly after Arats closed 
a 
two-day meeting in Beijing. 
  Participants outlined the organization's tasks in 1994 and 
discussed ways to improve its work, so that it can play a 
greater role in boosting cross-straits contracts and relations, 
and promoting peaceful reunification. 
  Arats has decided to establish a new economic department to 
respond to rapid indirect economic and trade relations between 
the mainland and Taiwan. 
  Also Jing Shuping, now Chairman of the All-China Federation 
of Industry and Commerce, will give up his post as an Arats 
vice- chairman and become an adviser.

<F P=106> [Article by Yang Yuanhu (2799 6678 5706): "A Historical </F>
Message That Shows Great Foresight--Tang Shubei, Executive Vice 
Chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait on Relations Between the Two Sides of the Strait Since 
the Publication of the `Message to Taiwan Compatriots'"] 
  [Text] The coming New Year's Day of 1994 is the 15th 
anniversary of the publication of the "Message to Taiwan 
Compatriots" by the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC]. In order to commemorate the publication of this 
important document, I interviewed Tang Shubei, executive vice 
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS]. 
<H5>  Strategic Decision Made at Turning Point of History </H5>
  Tang Shubei first pointed out that the "Message to Taiwan 
Compatriots" was produced at an important turning point in 
Chinese history. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, which was convened at the end of 1978, 
established the strategic goal centering on economic 
construction, and the mainland has since entered a new period of 
large-scale modernization construction. At the same time as 
China further developed ties with various countries in the 
world, China established diplomatic relations in the late 1970's 
with the United States and realized the normalization of 
relations; thus, China's international status was elevated 
unprecedentedly. At the same time, Chinese people on both sides 
of the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and compatriots 
and overseas Chinese all hoped to see the two sides of the 
Strait cooperate hand in hand to invigorate the Chinese nation 
together. It was precisely against such a background that the 
CPC adjusted its Taiwan policy and, through the publication of 
the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots," solemnly announced to the 
world that the past policy of "liberating Taiwan" had been 
changed to solving the Taiwan question through peaceful measures 
in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
  Tang Shubei said that history in the past 15 years has 
proved 
that the principle of the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland adopted by the Chinese Government is a strategic 
decision, not an expedient measure. This principle has been 
continuously perfected and developed in the past 15 years. 
  On 30 September 1981, NPC Chairman Ye Jianying made a speech 
(generally called Ye's nine-point speech) to further explain the 
principle and policy of solving the Taiwan question; he said 
that "after the reunification of the country, Taiwan will become 
a special administrative region, and will enjoy a high degree 
autonomy." He also suggested that the CPC and the Kuomintang 
hold talks on an equal footing. 
  On 22 February 1984, Deng Xiaoping proposed the concept of 
"one country, two systems," advocating that on the major premise 
of realizing the reunification of the country, the mainstay of 
the country would practice a socialist system and Taiwan a 
capitalist system. 
  On 12 October 1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We will unswervingly and actively 
promote the reunification of the motherland based on the 
principle of `peaceful reunification and one country, two 
systems.'" 
<H3>  The "Three Links" and "Four Exchanges" Are in Accordance 
With the Minds of the People on Both Sides of the Strait </H3>
  Tang Shubei thinks that the basic significance of the 
"Message to Taiwan Compatriots" is "pinning hope" on two areas, 
that is, "pinning hope on the Taiwan authorities and pinning 
hope on the Taiwan people." The "three links" raised by the 
message, that is, direct mail links, shipping and air links, and 
commercial links, as well as the "four exchanges," that is, 
exchanges of personnel for the main purpose of visiting 
relatives and places of interest, cultural exchanges, arts 
exchanges, and sports exchanges fully reflect the urgent wishes 
of the people on both sides of the Strait who have been 
separated for several decades and conforms to the minds of 
people on both sides of the Strait. 
  Tang Shubei said that after the issuance of the Message, the 
mainland side actively adopted positive measures, such as 
stopping shelling, abolishing the Fuzhou Military Region, and 
removing a large number of troops from the Fujian coast, 
markedly easing the atmosphere of military confrontation across 
the Strait. However, the Taiwan authorities did not respond to 
suggestions such as the "three links" and "four exchanges" 
raised by the message; on the contrary, they raised the "three 
no's" policy, that is, "no contacts, no negotiations, and no 
compromise," as a means of resistance. 
  However, the wishes of the people are irresistible, and the 
historical trend cannot be blocked. The Taiwan authorities 
began to adopt some measures to adjust the way it handled 
relations between the two sides of the Strait in August 1987, 
and they announced the lifting of the ban on Taiwan compatriots 
returning to the mainland to visit relatives, thus, they 
eventually responded to some of the calls in the "Message to 
Taiwan Compatriots" issued by the mainland. 
  Tang Shubei said that the adjustment of mainland policy by 
the Taiwan authorities had some positive meaning, for it is 
conducive to easing relations between the two sides of the 
Strait. It was precisely after the Taiwan authorities partly 
lifted the ban on Taiwan compatriots visiting relatives on the 
mainland that interactions between people on both sides of the 
Strait and exchanges in the civilian domain consistently 
developed and ceaselessly grew. At present, the call for 
expanding exchanges across the Strait in the "Message to Taiwan 
Compatriots" has already become a reality in the benevolent 
interactions between the two sides of the strait, as well as 
real actions by people on both sides of the strait. 
  Tang Shubei summed up the process of the development of 
interactions between people on both sides of the Strait, as well 
as exchanges in the civil domain, as follows: This developed 
from Taiwan compatriots coming to the mainland to visit 
relatives and for tourism, from tourism and visiting relatives 
to indirect trade and investment, from completely spontaneous, 
scattered, and civilian actions, to the establishment of 
empowered civilian groups on both sides of the strait -- the 
Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to discuss problems 
arising from cross-strait exchanges in the civilian domain, and 
these two groups have found some methods to solve these problems. 
  Tang Shubei stressed that these were historic changes which 
took place in the direction pointed out by the "Message to 
Taiwan Compatriots," whereas the strengths behind these changes 
were the people on both sides of the strait who promoted and 
brought about changes with the publication and under the 
guidance of the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots." Reflecting on 
these historic changes, we have gained important enlightenment, 
that is, people on both sides of the Strait should continue to 
play a promoting role and should urge the relevant quarters on 
the two sides of the Strait to continuously adjust their 
policies to further provide conditions for the development of 
civilian exchanges across the strait so as to conform to the 
situation of the prosperous development of civilian exchanges 
between both sides of the Strait. 
<H5>  The Greatest Revelation From the Wang-Koo Talks </H5>
  The Wang-Koo talks were an important and notable event in 
the 
course of the development of relations between the sides of the 
Taiwan Strait over the past four decades or more. As ARATS' 
executive vice chairman, Tong Shubei has participated in the 
entire course of the talks, from paving the way for the talks, 
to holding preparatory negotiations, to holding official talks. 
He maintains that the fact that the Wang-Koo talks were 
proposed and held and that agreements were reached is a vivid 
reflection of an inexorable trend in the vigorous development of 
exchanges between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait 
since the message to Taiwan compatriots was published, 
especially since 1987. 
  Tong Shubei said: Of the four agreements reached at the 
Wang-Koo talks, two are being implemented well, namely that on 
the use and enquiry of notary certificates and the other on 
enquiries into and compensation for registered mail. The other 
two agreements, namely the agreement on common agreements and 
regular contacts between the two organizations and the agreement 
on the institution of talks, although being implemented, the two 
sides have differences of understanding and implementation and 
need further negotiations. 
  Tong Shubei stressed: The greatest significance of the 
Wang-Koo talks and its greatest revelation to mankind is that 
under the one- China principle, the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait have sat down to talk (despite the fact that they 
understand the meaning of "one China" differently). By doing 
so, it is possible to find ways to resolve differences. 
  Tong Shubei recalled the warm welcome accorded to them by 
overseas Chinese in the United States and Canada when Wang 
Daohan and he visited there not long after the Wang-Koo talks. 
He said that overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent 
earnestly hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sit down 
and talk and find ways of to resolve differences. Regarding 
this, Tong Shubei said that it was now possible to find ways to 
resolve differences over ordinary matters when the two sides sat 
down and talked, it is possible, I believe, for the two sides to 
ultimately find ways of resolving political problems as long as 
they do so in good faith. For various reasons, it takes time, of 
course, to resolve political differences between the two sides, 
and we should both be patient. 
<H5>  Deepest Feelings About the ARATS' Work </H5>
  It is two years now since ARATS was set up in mid-December 
1991, and Tong Shubei has been its executive vice chairman ever 
since. His name is well known by people on the island and by all 
overseas people who are concerned about the development of 
cross-strait relations. Asked what his deepest feelings or 
experiences about his work in ARATS was, Tong Shubei answered 
after thinking a little: I assumed diplomatic posts for a long 
time and had contacts with some Taiwan compatriots and some 
understanding of Taiwan. Since assuming the post of executive 
vice chairman of ARATS, some previous work experience has been 
useful and some has not. In the past two years, I have 
continuously deepened my understanding of the various aspects of 
Taiwan and have, given the present pattern of cross-strait 
relations, always explored how to do well in empowering 
nongovernmental bodies, strengthening cooperation with the SEF, 
jointly promoting contacts between the people of the two sides 
and various nongovernmental exchanges, and safeguarding the 
legitimate rights and interests of the two sides. 
  Tong Shubei said: The deepest work experience over the past 
two years has been that cooperation between the ARATS and the 
SEF is premised on the current political differences and 
unconformity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which 
is a fact, and that the foundation for cooperation is the 
existence of the people's aspirations, which demand the 
strengthening of contacts and exchanges. At present, there are 
differences and unconformity between the two sides over such 
issues as the nature of politics, laws, common rights, and 
jurisdiction. Despite these kind of differences, ARATS and the 
SEF are to cooperate and make efforts to resolve problems 
arising from contacts and exchanges between their people. 
  Moreover, Tong Shubei pointed out that when they avoided 
such 
issues as politics, laws, common rights, and jurisdiction, which 
will be difficult to reach agreement on for some time, in the 
course of negotiations over ordinary matters, ARATS and the SEF 
had succeeded in their cooperation. He illustrated this by 
saying that the two sides had reached agreement on the use of 
notary certificates and on enquiries into and compensation for 
registered mail when they avoided the above questions. 
<H5>  Prospects for Cooperation With the SEF </H5>
  Asked about the prospects for cooperation between the ARATS 
and the SEF in 1994, Tong Shubei said that the two organizations 
would probably continue to have difficulties in cooperation next 
year. If the two sides could avoid political differences, then 
next year could be very promising. We have note speeches made 
recently by some responsible persons in the SEF and the 
"Mainland Work Committee" and that some of their views conform 
with ours. If the two sides avoid political differences, then 
the agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks can be implemented 
very well and the two organizations will probably make great 
strides in their cooperation. If so, it will surely be very good 
for contacts between the people of the two sides and for various 
nongovernmental exchanges. In short, hope and difficulties 
coexist. I personally hope that the scope of cooperation 
between ARATS and the SEF will be further expanded. If invited 
to Taiwan, I will frankly and sincerely express my views to my 
Taiwan friends. I am, of course, also willing to listen to 
their views so that we can find more common points.

7230): "Heading Toward a New Stage of Nongovernmental and 
Economic Consultations and Cooperation -- a Reexamination and 
Observation of Mainland-Taiwan Relations in 1993"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- With the successful 
meeting between Wang Daohan [president of the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- ARATS] and Gu Zhenfu [Ku 
Chen-fu, chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange 
Foundation -- SEF] as the benchmark, mainland-Taiwan relations 
in 1993 stepped into a new stage in which real problems were to 
be resolved through consultations. During 1993, mainland-Taiwan 
relations continued to relax, contacts and exchanges continued 
to increase rapidly in various fields, two-way exchanges 
broadened, economic contacts and trade continued to maintain the 
momentum of rapid development, and the need "to intensify 
complementary and reciprocal cross-strait economic exchange" 
became an understanding shared by the two sides. Meanwhile, 
people at home and abroad were greatly concerned with the 
repeated disputes on the island surrounding the so-called "two 
sovereign states" and the moves for "returning to the United 
Nations." 
  The "Wang-Gu meeting" certainly was the most noticeable 
event 
in the development of mainland-Taiwan relations in 1993. Thanks 
to the efforts exerted by the two sides, including ARATS and the 
SEF, the meeting eventually took place in Singapore at the end 
of April after 18 months of preparations. Even though it was 
described as nongovernmental, this first formal meeting of 
high-level personnel of the two sides in more than 40 years was 
a highly significant meeting. The four accords signed at the 
meeting set the principle that the two sides should intensify 
their complementary and reciprocal economic exchanges and 
formally established the channels for cross-strait contacts, 
thereby providing guidance for future cross-strait consultations 
and enabling the two sides to take an important, historic step 
forward in developing their relations. After the accords reached 
at the "Wang-Gu meeting" became effective at the end of May, the 
use of notarization documents and inquiry of relevant issues 
proceeded smoothly, and the quantity of cross-strait registered 
mail increased rapidly, greatly facilitating family contacts and 
various other exchange activities between people of the two 
sides. In order to fully implement the accords, ARATS and 
Taiwan's SEF had three working meetings -- held respectively in 
Beijing, Xiamen, and Taibei [Taipei] -- during the second half 
of 1993. In addition to discussing and exchanging views on the 
issues prescribed in the "Common Agreement of the Wang-Gu 
Meeting," the two sides, because of actual needs, also agreed to 
discuss the issue about "repatriation of plane hijackers." With 
the understanding and support from people of all walks of life 
in Taiwan for the ARATS representatives' first visit to Taiwan 
for consultations, ARATS-SEF contacts and cooperation continued 
to develop, and nongovernmental cross-strait consultations 
continued to deepen. 
  The successful "Wang-Gu meeting" has instilled new vitality 
into cross-strait contacts and exchange. In 1993, two-way 
exchanges broadened and there were contacts of personnel of 
higher levels. It has been estimated that over five million 
countrymen in Taiwan will have visited the mainland over the 
years, including the 1.5 million in 1993. Among those 
countrymen visiting the mainland for various exchange programs, 
there was noticeably a greater number of well- known personages 
including "national assemblymen," "legislators," members of the 
Kuomintang [KMT] Central Committee, and principal leaders of 
other parties. Mainland personnel have also made new headway in 
visiting Taiwan for various exchange programs. The number of 
groups organized by scientific-technological, art, sports, and 
journalistic circles to visit Taiwan for exchange programs was 
noticeably higher than previous years. According to statistics 
released by relevant authorities, during the period from January 
to 15 December, 3,140 persons were approved to visit Taiwan for 
481 exchange projects. The broadening and deepening of two-way 
exchange have powerfully promoted the understanding between 
countrymen of the two sides. 
  The strong momentum in the development of cross-strait 
economic contacts and trade has continued. According to 
statistics, indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong exceeded 
$6.3 billion during the January-September period, and the trade 
volume in 1993 was estimated at more than $10 billion. Taiwan 
countrymen's craze for investing their money on the mainland 
continued. In fact, the craze heated up as a result of the 
"Wang-Gu meeting." By the end of June 1993, over 15,100 
Taiwan-funded businesses with a total negotiated investment of 
$13.6 billion had been approved. More large businesses and 
consortia in Taiwan came to the mainland to study investment 
possibilities. In early May, the first group of bankers from 15 
nongovernmental banks in Taiwan came to visit the mainland. At 
stockholders' meetings in Taiwan in mid-July, 38 percent of the 
270 listed Taiwan corporations authorized the corporations' 
boards of directors to directly handle their mainland's 
investment businesses, which involved NT$42.7 [new Taiwan 
dollars] billion. Although Taiwan's banking business and the 
listed corporations were unable to realize their mainland 
investment plans owing to the Taiwan authorities' obstruction, 
their attempts indicated the significant trend for cross-strait 
economic exchanges and cooperation. To expedite cross-strait 
economic cooperation and trade, an executive meeting of the 
State Council adopted the "PRC Law for Protecting Taiwan 
Countrymen's Investment." This law, which was submitted to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee on 20 
December for its deliberations, shows the mainland has made 
substantial progress in standardizing and institutionalizing 
cross-strait economic relations and trade. 
  Another major event relevant to mainland-Taiwan relations in 
1993 was the publication of the Chinese Government white paper 
entitled "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," which has 
aroused enthusiastic response among people at home and abroad. 
This programmatic document bearing on the motherland's peaceful 
reunification has fully and comprehensively expounded the 
Chinese Government's Taiwan policy and the origin and nature of 
the Taiwan issue, and it has summed up all the general and 
specific policies drawn up since the NPC published its "Message 
to Countrymen in Taiwan" in 1979. The white paper has firmly 
safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and 
denounced the fallacies and activities of "Taiwan independence." 
It also points out that "Taiwan countrymen's wishes to be the 
masters of their own house are fair, reasonable, and legitimate. 
These wishes are different from `Taiwan independence,' and 
these countrymen are totally different from those who insist on 
following the course of `Taiwan independence.'" By stating 
this, the white paper has pointed out the way of knowing 
Taiwan's real public opinion. 
  In the past year, there have been fluctuations in the 
progress of cross-strait relations, and some new variables have 
appeared. Taiwan authorities have relaxed somewhat their policy 
on cross-strait exchanges. At the end of 1993, Taiwan's SEF 
proposed, on its own accord, that its third working meeting with 
ARATS be held in Taibei. Consequently, a meeting concerning 
cross-strait general affairs was held on the island for the 
first time. On the other hand, Taiwan authorities have in the 
past year spread various inappropriate remarks on the principle 
of one China, including repeating the statement on "giving 
priority to Taiwan" within the island, and spreading the 
comments that "political entities on both sides of the Taiwan 
Strait are on an equal footing." Immediately after the "Wang-Gu 
meeting," Taiwan authorities played up the view that "the 
meeting has demonstrated the fact that both sides of the strait 
are on an equal footing, split, and under separate 
jurisdictions." During the three follow-up meetings aimed at 
implementing accords reached at the "Wang-Gu meeting," the 
Taiwan side also repeatedly stressed the so-called "sovereign, 
administrative, and judicial powers," attempting to use 
cross-strait routine meetings to fulfill its objective of 
playing up the allegation that Taiwan is the so-called 
"political entity on an equal footing." In the middle of 1993, 
the "National Unification Conference" held by Taiwan authorities 
"redefined the meaning" of the principle of one China. 
Additionally, at the end of 1993, officials -- sent by Taiwan 
authorities to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
conference in Seattle -- publicly announced they would implement 
the "policy of two China's as a phase [jie duan xing de liang ge 
zhong guo zheng ce 7132 3008 4104 0257 0020 0022 0948 2398 
4595]." Meanwhile, the Taiwan authorities' campaign to "expand 
their international space" has gone astray. Before, during, and 
after the United Nations General Assembly's sessions in 1993, 
Taiwan authorities sent many personnel to launch activities in 
various localities in the international community, clamoring "to 
reenter (or termed as join) the United Nations." The Taiwan 
authorities' regression on their one-China position has provoked 
strong opposition from people on both sides of the strait, and 
from the broad masses of Chinese overseas. Domestic and 
international public opinion have pointed out: There is only 
one China in the world. The position of Taiwan as a part of 
China is definite and unchangeable. Any plots attempting to 
create "two China's," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan 
independence" are doomed to failure. 
  When reviewing the progress of cross-strait relations in 
1993, we notice: Enhancing cross-strait relations and 
expeditiously increasing further bilateral exchanges and visits 
suit the interests of people on both sides of the strait. 
Therefore, the broad masses of people support such activities. 
On the contrary, all attempts -- obstructing the progress of 
cross-strait relations and hampering further cross-strait 
exchanges and visits -- will definitely fail because of the 
people's opposition. When looking forward in 1994, we believe: 
With high expectations and joint efforts from people on both 
sides of the strait, cross-strait exchanges and visits will 
increase further. When judging the progress of cross-strait 
relations, people will focus their attention on the outcome of 
meetings concerning cross-strait general affairs. Nevertheless, 
we should also notice: A very small number of people, inside 
and outside Taiwan, who are unwilling to see a reunited China, 
will continually change their methods; will create trouble under 
various pretexts; and will promote their plots of attempting to 
create "two China's," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan 
independence." We must remain highly vigilant and mete out 
resolute blows to such moves.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA) -- Private Taiwan banks are 
still prohibited from setting up branches in Mainland China, a 
finance official said Friday [14 January]. 
  Deputy director Chang Hsiu-lien of the Finance Ministry's 
Bureau of Monetary Affairs said at a public hearing in the 
Legislative Yuan that the ban is in accordance with the initial 
stage of the Guidelines for National Unification. 
  Chang, however, said that a written evaluation on the 
feasibility of allowing private banks to set up branches in a 
third country is expected to be finished at the end of the year. 
  Chang made the remarks in response to growing demands by 
private bank officials to be allowed to set up on the mainland. 
The officials argue that increased cross-Taiwan Strait trade is 
making such service necessary. 
  Chang also said there is growing resistance in Mainland 
China 
to the establishment of Taiwan banks there. He said the 
mainland authorities are worried the Taiwan banks are more 
competitive than their mainland counterparts. 
  His statement was contradicted by a Friday report in the 
Hong 
Kong WEN WEI PO which said Beijing authorities in charge of 
Taiwan affairs have decided to allow the opening of 
Taiwan-invested banks in the mainland. 
  The Beijing-backed paper reported that the Beijing officials 
also decided to hold a national conference this spring to review 
progress in economic and trade exchanges with Taiwan and are 
mulling the formation of a State Council task force to 
coordinate Taiwan economic and trade policy. 
  The decision were reportedly made at a recent meeting 
attended by the heads of Beijing Central Government departments 
in charge of Taiwan affairs.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA) -- Ever-increasing 
investments made by domestic manufacturers in Mainland China 
will have a positive impact on Taiwan's economy in the short 
term, an official at the Council for Economic Planning and 
Development (CEPD) said Friday [14 January]. 
  K.C. Li, director of the CEPD Economic Research Department, 
made the remarks at a public hearing on the influence of the 
mainland investment fever. 
  The public hearing was sponsored by legislators P.H. Peng 
and 
T.J. Tsai of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. 
  Taiwan investors relocated their production lines to the 
other side of the Taiwan Strait mainly due to the cheap labor, 
low land prices, and easy land acquisition on the mainland, Li 
pointed out. 
  The investment advantages make production costs on the 
mainland much lower than on Taiwan, thereby benefiting Taiwan 
investors, he elaborated. 
  Growing Taiwan investment in Mainland China, which in turn 
pushed up mainland demand for Taiwan's products such as electric 
and electronics parts as well as machinery, has fueled Taiwan's 
exports, he added. 
  The mainland investment fever has therefore emerged as the 
driving force behind Taiwan's economic growth in the past few 
years, he noted, saying Taiwan's economy might post zero growth 
without mainland investment. 
  Statistics show that approved investment in Mainland China 
amounted to US$3.16 billion last year, while other outbound 
investment totaled US$1.66 billion. Unofficial estimates put 
aggregate Taiwan investment in Mainland China at roughly US$10 
billion. 
  The CEPD official, however, expressed the worry that more 
big 
Taiwan enterprises might follow their small- and medium-sized 
counterparts to the mainland. 
  Too many and too big investment projects in Mainland China 
will eat away at Taiwan's capital, he said. 
  In the long run, he said, the government must work to 
improve 
the domestic investment climate and to expedite the upgrading of 
the industrial base with a view to gaining an upper hand on the 
international market.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA) -- A ten-member Thai 
delegation is scheduled to visit Taipei Jan. 26 to negotiate the 
signing of an investment guarantee agreement with Taiwan. 
  The delegation, to be led by Chaiyung Satjipanon [name as 
received], deputy chief of the Thai Foreign Ministry Economic 
Affairs Department, will also include officials from the 
Ministries of Industry, Transport and Communications, 
Agriculture, and Finance. 
  Taiwan and Thailand exchanged a draft proposal on the 
investment guarantee agreement last February. The January 
meeting will discuss the draft as well as sign an agreement to 
avoid double taxation. 
  An official of Taipei's Thailand Trade and Economic Office 
pointed out that signing of the agreements will boost Taiwan 
investment in the Southeast Asian country. 
  He also assured that Taiwan investors' interests will not be 
affected by the unstable political situation in Thailand. 
  Taiwan investment in Thailand peaked in 1988, with 308 
investments approved by the Thai Government. Total investment 
in that year was US$859.94 million 
  Until the end of August 1993, accumulated Taiwan investment 
in Thailand topped US$4.4 billion, ranking fourth among foreign 
investors. Japan is the leading investor in the country. 
  Taiwan businessmen mostly invested in machinery, hardware, 
information and electronics, plastic and rubber, textiles, and 
chemical industries. 
  Meanwhile, Marut Bunnag [name as received], speaker of the 
House of Representatives and also president of the National 
Assembly of Thailand, will lead a 14-member group to visit 
Taiwan Jan. 17-22. 
  He will be the first Thai congressional leader to visit 
Taipei. 
  While here, Marut will visit President Li Teng-ui, Premier 
Lien Chan, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, and Legislative 
Yuan President Liu Sung-fan.

  [Text] In order to assist domestic manufacturers to enter 
markets of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, 
the Economic Ministry has formed a fact-finding mission to the 
region. The ministry has already decided upon four areas in 
Mexico to assist Taiwan manufacturers in setting up investment 
and factories. The NAFTA formally went into effect at the 
beginning of this year. Due to the advantageous position of 
Mexico, the ministry has decided to put focus on developing 
markets in that country. The ministry's Investment Commission, 
the China External Trade Development Council, and the Chinese 
Chamber of Commerce in Mexico jointly held the fact- finding 
mission and selected the areas most suited to the needs of local 
manufacturers. The ministry will hold forums explaining the 
investment targets in Taipei and Taichung over the next several 
days, as well as introducing the NAFTA and the effects of it on 
Taiwan.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wen (6392 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Eighteen 
chairmen of Hong Kong's district board are now extensively 
collecting signatures from among board members to support their 
bid to urge Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten to withdraw the 
partial electoral draft bill he has submitted to the Legislative 
Council [Legco] and retain a certain proportion of appointed 
seats in the composition of the 1994 district boards. 
  In an interview with this reporter, Wen Han-chang, chairman 
of the Sai Kung District Board, said: The main role of a 
district board is to extensively consult public opinion, thus 
enabling residents to get involved more effectively in district 
affairs. It is a local consultative organ whose main role is to 
serve as a bridge between residents and the local administrative 
organs of the Hong Kong Government. He pointed out that all 
board members being elected by voters is the development 
direction of a democratic political system. This is of no 
doubt. However, in Hong Kong, which has long been under British 
rule, the general public has a very poor sense of democracy and 
inadequate enthusiasm about participating in district affairs. 
Moreover, the voter turnout rate in every previous election has 
been low. This being the case, retaining a certain proportion 
of appointed seats will ensure that board members will have 
broader representation and the interests and opinions of 
residents in different trades and social strata can be balanced 
and taken into account. This way of doing things is still 
necessary. 
  Wen Han-chang suggested: As far as the composition of 
district boards is concerned, the Legco model can be adopted; 
that is, the number of appointed seats can gradually be cut and 
in the end all seats will be elected by the voters. As for the 
composition of the 1994 district boards, the number of appointed 
seats could be cut from the current one-third to about 
one-fourth. For the following term, the government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region could decide whether 
appointed seats will be cut further or if all seats will be 
elected by voters. 
  Wen Han-chang said: Of the 19 district board chairmen, 18 
have clearly expressed their demand for Hong Kong Governor 
Patten to retain a certain proportion of appointed seats in the 
composition of the 1994 district boards. Moreover, numerous 
members of the district boards in Hong Kong have also submitted 
a joint letter to the Governor to voice the above-mentioned 
demand, but he has paid no heed. This is indeed a perfect irony 
of the so-called principle of "being open, fair, and acceptable 
to the people of Hong Kong," which he has asserted again and 
again. 
  Wen Han-chang hoped that the current extensive collection of 
board members' signatures of support would help urge Governor 
Patten to withdraw the partial electoral bill he has submitted 
to Legco and retain a certain proportion of appointed seats in 
the composition of the 1994 district boards.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Ulanmulun 
and Zhu Yucheng, deputy directors of the Hong Kong branch of 
XINHUA, held talks with 16 Hong Kong affairs advisers for more 
than two hours today to solicit their opinions on ways to 
maintain Hong Kong's economic prosperity and bring about a 
smooth transition without the cooperation of the British side. 
  Advisers present at today's talk held an optimistic view on 
Hong Kong's economic prospects. They believe that Hong Kong's 
economic prosperity is based on the sustained, steady [wen ding 
4489 1353], and rapid economic development of mainland China and 
also on China's policy of reform and opening up. Although the 
British side refuses to cooperate with the Chinese side on the 
issue of Hong Kong, as long as China persistently expands 
opening up, deepens reform, and brings further growth to its 
economic development, Hong Kong's economic prosperity is 
guaranteed. 
  However, this does not mean that there are no hidden worries 
for Hong Kong's economy. The advisers pointed out during the 
talk that besides the possibility that the British side might 
deliberately damage Hong Kong's economy, the biggest hidden 
worry for Hong Kong's economy is inflation. They pointed out 
that inflation is weakening Hong Kong's competitive capacity 
with each passing day, and the livelihood of the common people 
has been considerably affected. However, instead of taking steps 
to ease inflation, the British Hong Kong Government is spending 
without restraint and putting forward a number of measures which 
will result in spiralling inflation. The Chinese and Hong Kong 
citizens should pay great attention to this fact and the 
Preliminary Working Committee should study this issue and draw 
up countermeasures. 
  During the talk, advisers focused their discussions on the 
White Paper concerning the regulations for the Airport 
Corporation, which was recently released by the Hong Kong 
Government. They shared the same view that the regulations are 
not strong enough to supervise the operation of the Airport 
Corporation. The company is placed totally beyond the 
supervision of the public and only the governor and the 
Executive Council have the right to oversee its operations. In 
addition, the power of chairman of the board of directors and 
the executive director of the Airport Corporation are 
concentrated in one person and the Airport Corporation itself 
has no right to dismiss its managing director; as a result, the 
supervision by the board of directors is but an empty shell and 
people really feel worried that the Airport Corporation may 
become an "independent fiefdom." 
  Some Hong Kong affairs advisers even questioned whether or 
not it is appropriate for the Hong Kong Government to change the 
Provisional Airport Authority into the Airport Corporation 
before China and Britain have reached an agreement on the 
financial arrangements for the new airport. They also wonder if 
the relevant suggestion has violated the spirit of the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the building of Hong Kong's 
airport reached between China and Britain. 
  Advisers expressed worries over the financial arrangements 
for the new airport, which remains unsettled to this day. They 
pointed out that the consensus of all sides is that Hong Kong 
needs a new airport and the Chinese have always shown support 
for the idea. The problem we are facing now is how to urge the 
British side to produce, in line with the spirit of the 
Memorandum of Understanding, a financial arrangement which 
conforms to the principle of cost efficiency so that the airport 
project can be developed in a comprehensive way as soon as 
possible. 
  A total of 16 Hong Kong affairs advisers were present at 
today's talks: Ann Tse-kai, Tsui Tsin-tong, Tsao Kuang-piao, 
Cheng Yu-tung, Lee Peng-fei, Kuo Ping-hsiang, Hsieh Kuo-min, 
Tang Hsiang-chien, Kuo Ho-nien, Chan Wen-chiu, Hu Ching-chang, 
Hsu Shih-hsiung, Wu Ching- hui, Chang Yung-chen, Huang 
Chih-hsiang, and Yuen Pei-yao.

  [Text] The Government scored a major victory yesterday by 
securing support from legislators to pump $1.67 billion into the 
Chek Lap Kok airport project despite Chinese objections. 
  While China yesterday reiterated its opposition to what it 
called Hong Kong's unilateral move to go ahead with the airport 
in the absence of approval from Beijing, at least 32 legislators 
said they would grant sufficient funds to keep the airport 
project going. 
  The Government yesterday held two separate sessions for 
lawmakers and the Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) to 
collect their opinions before making a final decision tomorrow. 
  From the $1.67 billion, $377 million will be given to the 
Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to continue operating until 
March. Critical contracts -- for baggage handling, the 
automated people mover, foundation work for the passenger 
terminal, and some construction support facilities -- can be 
awarded in the first quarter of this year to avoid delay. 
  The Government had earlier offered two options to 
legislators 
-- to grant $377 million for the PAA, or to approve $1.3 billion 
for the critical work. The Government is likely to secure 
support from the 15 Liberal Party legislators, 13 United 
Democrat legislators, and independents Emily Lau Wai-hing, 
Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen, Eric Li Ka-cheung and Jimmy McGregor. 
Only pro-China legislator Philip Wong Yu-hong indicated that he 
would not support any funding proposal, while Tam Yiu-chung said 
he preferred the first option. 
  Mr Tam said approving just enough money to extend the PAA 
head office funding into 1994/95 would better facilitate the 
resumption of airport talks with China. Following the 
legislators' expression of support, the Government will ask the 
Legislative Council's Finance Committee to approve the $1.67 
billion proposal on January 21. 
  Liberal Party legislator Howard Young said there was no 
dissenting voice among them in make a commitment that the new 
airport could be completed on time without seeking further 
substantial injections of cash. 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, 
yesterday 
reiterated Chinese opposition to any unilateral action taken by 
the British side before striking a deal on the financial 
arrangements with China. "Before agreement is reached between 
the two sides, unilateral actions will do no good to the 
settlement of the financial arrangements," he said. 
  The Secretary for the Treasury, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, 
rejected the Chinese suggestion that the British side was taking 
a unilateral move. Asked whether Britain would take Chinese 
objections into consideration, Mr Tsang said: "We are used to 
it." 
  During a meeting of the Legco subcommittee on the financing 
of the airport core programme, legislators pressed the 
Government to either give an expected date of reaching a deal 
with China, or to unveil full contingency plans for the airport 
projects in the absence of Chinese blessing.

  [Text] Governor Chris Patten has again vented his 
frustration over almost two years of protracted negotiations on 
the financing of the new airport. The negotiations--already 
deadlocked--have become a casualty of the Sino-British fall-out 
over political reform. 
  "What would help us a great deal is to be in a situation in 
which we didn't feel as though we're playing darts blindfold in 
the dark, hoping to hit the bull's-eye," he said. 
  "What would be a help would be if the Chinese side gave 
precisely what funding arrangements they would regard as 
acceptable. 
  "These funds would help in the future of the Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) government the community here in 
Hong Kong and for the railway and the airport itself." 
  Patten voiced concern that the airport negotiations were 
becoming bogged down by obscure political bickering and he again 
urged the Chinese to return to the negotiating table. "We could 
rapidly resolve all that I would have hoped in the airport 
committee if the will was there." 
  It is now unlikely the airport project will be completed by 
mid- 1997, but rather months after the transfer of sovereignty. 
  "Instead of offering one another advice across the airwaves, 
we should actually do what people in Hongkong would like us to 
do which is to resolve these questions around the table," he 
said.

  [Text] Macao, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The frontier post 
(check point) at the barrier gate of Macao, a gateway through 
which passengers can go directly into China's mainland, was put 
into official use today. 
  The old barrier gate will be protected as cultural relics 
and 
a tourism spot from now on. 
  After the frontier post was put into operation, passengers 
come and leave Macao will have to go through the entry and exit 
passages of the post. All entry and exit procedures will remain 
unchanged. 
  Costing more than 30 million Macao patacas (about 3.8 
million 
U.S. dollars), construction of the frontier post started in 1990 
and it was first put into initial use in February 1993. 
  During last year's February-November period, there were more 
than 15.37 million passengers going through the post and there 
were also 1.06 million freight cars passing the post in the same 
period. 
  The barrier gate is the only passage in Macao leading to 
China's mainland on land. It is connected with Gongbei of 
Zhuhai city, south China's Guangdong Province. 
  Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira, Guo 
Dongpo, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao branch, and 
many noted personages in Macao participated in today's ceremony 
for the inauguration of the frontier post.

  [Text] Nanchang, January 13 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Jiangxi Province is spreading family planning knowledge through 
spare time schools. 
  Zhu Jufang, deputy director of Jiangxi Provincial Family 
Planning Commission, said that in 1,782 townships, towns and 
plants in the province, there are now 2,027 family planning 
schools with 10,500 teachers. 
  She said that most of the schools are equipped with color 
TV's, tape recorders and other modern teaching facilities. 
  The schools give classes to and provide textbooks for people 
according to sex, age, occupation and marital status. 
  Up to now, about 2.2 million people have received

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY 
[RENMIN RIBAO], the leading national newspaper, carries a signed 
article today, hailing the role of Deng Xiaoping in promoting 
the opening up and development of the Pudong New Area in 
Shanghai, the country's largest industrial city. 
  Written by Huang Qifan, the article says that Deng Xiaoping 
was the originator of the policy of opening the Pudong New Area 
to the outside world and turning it into a development zone. 
  After inspecting Shanghai and returning to Beijing in early 
1990, the article reveals, Deng told leaders of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party of 
China (CPC) that although he had retired, he still had to remind 
them of the importance of the development of the Pudong area. 
  In April 1990 the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council, the country's supreme governing bodies, officially 
announced an important decision on the opening up and 
development of the Pudong area, listing it as a national focal 
point of the country's opening and development projects in the 
following ten years. 
  Deng pointed out that the opening up of Shanghai would bring 
about great changes to the Chang Jiang Delta, the Chang Jiang 
Valley and even the whole country. 
  After listening to a report about the work of the 
development 
of the Pudong area delivered by Zhu Rongji, then mayor of 
Shanghai, in February 1991, Deng said, "Finance is important. 
It is the core of a modern economy. If financial work is done 
well it will be easy to get everything done well. Shanghai used 
to be a banking center, where various currencies could be 
exchanged freely. It is necessary to return to this practice. 
China's hope for occupying an international position in finance 
should first be pinned on Shanghai." 
  Following Deng's instructions, Shanghai has given priority 
to 
finance in the development of the Pudong area. In the past 
three years 38 new domestic and overseas financial enterprises 
have been set up in Shanghai. The total deposits in the banks 
in Pudong have reached 25 billion yuan, while the banks' loans 
have amounted to 24 billion yuan -- about 12 times the figures 
for 1990. Meanwhile, the stock market, and insurance and other 
financial businesses have developed rapidly, thus greatly 
promoting the development of various industries such as 
construction and commerce. 
  Deng also showed great concern about the development of 
infrastructure and high-tech industries in the Pudong New Area. 
He has repeatedly stressed the importance of building several 
bridges over the Huangpu River in the area and the importance of 
focusing funds on construction projects in the power, 
communications and other infrastructural sectors. Besides, he 
pointed out that quick economic development depended on science, 
technology and education. A breakthrough in the field of 
high-technology will bring about the development of many 
industries, he noted. 
  The article also discloses that in the past few years Deng 
has given many instructions on development of the Pudong area. 
He once urged Shanghai people to further broaden their minds, 
be bolder and quicken their pace in the opening up and 
development of the Pudong area. Last year in Shanghai Deng 
called on Shanghai people to continue to make efforts, overcome 
difficulties and strive for further achievements. 
  The article lists various achievements Shanghai has made in 
opening up and developing the Pudong area, and says that Deng's 
strategic policies have been carried out in the course of this 
opening up and development.

  [Summary] Shandong Province has succeeded in improving its 
auto industry to a new level thanks to vigorously readjusting 
the mix of products, introducing advanced technologies from 
foreign countries, and setting up technical and economic 
associations with fraternal provinces. In 1993 the province 
realized a total output of 7.68 billion yuan, which showed a 38 
percent increase over 1992 and realized 740 million yuan of 
profits and taxes, which showed a 46 percent increase over 1992. 
The sale rate of products reached more than 95 percent. During 
the year, the province turned out 176 varieties of new products. 
Of these varieties, four reached the world standard; 11 filled 
the national gaps in this regard; and 35 reached the national 
advanced standards. The rate of output value of these new 
products reached 31.7 percent which surpasses that of 1992 by 10 
percent.

Zhejiang Province reported record economic development in 1993. 
  Its gross domestic product last year went up by 25 percent

to 392.8 billion yuan, up 52.5 percent over the 1992 figure.

<F P=106> [Report: "Huizhou Villagers Brought Explosives To Claim </F>
Damages, and Public Security Personnel Opened Fire To Prevent 
Occurrence of Explosion"] 
  [Text] A fracas took place in Guangdong's Huizhou over the 
issue of the local government taking over rural land; some 20 
villagers carrying explosives asking for compensation in the 
region of 10 million yuan. At the crucial point when the 
villagers were ready to light the fuse, local public security 
men opened fire to prevent an explosion occurring. 
  It was learned that on the afternoon of 4 January, villagers 
from Chentang village, Xiaojinkou town, and the Huicheng 
district of suburban Huizhou had a dispute with personnel from 
the Huizhou Administrative Zone government over the issue of the 
local government taking over rural land for its use. 
  Some 20 villagers from Huicheng district armed with hunting 
rifles, knives, and two boxes of explosives took a car from the 
Huizhou urban area to the Jinji administrative district to ask 
the local government for some 10 miilion yuan in compensation. 
When three policemen on patrol went to stop them, the angry 
villagers beat up the three policemen, one of whom was wounded 
in the head and hospitalized for medical treatment. 
  The 20-odd villagers threatened to return the following day, 
and demanded administrative committee personnel get the money 
ready, otherwise, they would level the administrative zone with 
explosives. Then the villagers left by car. 
  When the Huicheng Administrative Zone government heard the 
report, it promptly organized the police to deal with any 
contingencies. 
  Around 1800 the next day, four of the aforesaid villagers 
arrived at the administrative committee office building carrying 
hunting rifles and explosives and demanding cash. 
  The Huicheng district work group for improving the social 
order of Xiaojinkou substation immediately sent 14 public 
security men to the scene by car. 
  Seeing this, the villagers got their explosives ready 
quickly, lit cigarettes, and were ready to light the fuse, while 
threatening to perish together with the public security men in a 
very tense atmosphere. 
  The local public security men ordered the villagers to put 
down the explosives, while evacuating citizens; at the same 
time, they opened fire as a warning. 
  Nevertheless, the villagers with explosives had already 
pointed their lit cigarettes at the fuse. At this critical 
moment, local security men opened fire and wounded the villager 
holding the explosives. 
  At the same time, two other security men dashed up and 
seized 
the explosives in the villager's hands, thus succeeding in 
halting the occurrence of an explosion.

  [Text] Havana, January 5 (XINHUA) -- The Cuban Air Charter 
Company denied today that the whole crew of an Aerocaribbean 
Airliner defected in Great Cayman Island. 
  Cuba's official news agency, PRENSA LATINA, said 
vice-president of the air charter company Pedro Manduley 
confirmed that the copilot of the plane chose not to return to 
Cuba and was detained by the Caribbean island immigration 
authorities. 
  The DC-3, with 11 tourists aboard, flying the Havana-Great 
Cayman-Havana route, was bound for the capital during the next 
hours, said the Cuban official. 
  After the incident occurred Tuesday [4 January], the captain 
of the aircraft and three crew members called the main offices 
of the Aerocaribbean Tuesday night to ask for authorized return 
flight. 
  According to international rules, no aircraft can fly 
without 
a copilot. As a result, the return was postponed until today 
after another copilot was flown in a company plane to Great 
Cayman, said Manduley.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 14 (AFP)--Zhou Duo, a major figure 
in the 1989 democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, 
has quietly returned to China after more than a year abroad, 
human rights sources said Friday. 
  Zhou, 45, an economist, crossed into the neighboring city of 
Shenzhen -- apparently without hindrance -- on Wednesday after 
spending six days with friends in Hong Kong, the sources said. 
He was expected to proceed to Beijing. 
  Zhou had been abroad for 14 months, travelling through 
Europe, including Russia, and the United States. 
  Much of his time was spent at Harvard University, where he 
"voraciously" read Chinese books banned or otherwise unavailable 
in the People's Republic, one of the sources said. 
  Zhou was among four dissidents -- another was Taiwan pop 
singer Hou Dejian -- who staged a hunger strike just before the 
Chinese army shot its way into Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. 
  He was subsequently jailed for 10 months without charge, 
then 
detained for another 18 days on the first anniversary of the 
massacre. 
  Another Tiananmen veteran, labor activist Han Dongfang, 
remains stranded in Hong Kong -- despite repeated attempts to go 
home -- after being expelled from China in August following a 
year in the United States.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan 14 (AFP)--China announced Friday that 
high-level talks with Taiwan would resume on January 31, but 
Taipei retorted it was considering suspending the key meeting, 
citing China's "unfriendly moves" towards it. 
  In Beijing, the official CHINA DAILY reported that Tang 
Shubei, vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) would meet with his Taiwan counterpart 
Chiao Jun-ho on January 31 to discuss economic "and other 
non-political issues." 
  The five-day talks in Beijing were expected to pave the way 
for a meeting between ARATS chairman Wang Daohan and the 
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Koo 
Chen-fu, who first met for a landmark get-together in Singapore 
in April, analysts said. 
  CHINA DAILY quoted Tang as saying he hoped his talks with 
Chiao would settle matters concerning the Wang-Koo meeting and 
set the starting date for talks on economic, scientific and 
technological cooperation. 
  But in Taipei, a mainland affairs official said Friday that 
Taiwan was considering suspending the talks. 
  "We have decided to make a re-evaluation on whether the 
talks 
between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei should be held as planned," 
said Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland 
Affairs Council (MAC). 
  "Mainland China has made a series of unfriendy moves against 
us recently and set pre-conditions on topics to be discussed (in 
the meeting,) trying to deny our legal jurisdiction by avoiding 
political issues," Kao said. 
  The various steps Beijing had taken to isolate Taiwan and 
its 
effort to threaten the island militarily "had caused negative 
response from the people here and undoubtedly led to adverse 
impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait," Kao said. 
  Taiwan's threat came only two days after China and France 
issued a communique in which Paris had pledged not to sell 
Taiwan any more arms in order to normalize relations with 
Beijing following a year-long freeze caused by its supply of 60 
Mirage 2005 jet fighters to the island. 
  The landlocked African state of Lesotho also announced 
Wednesday the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with 
China and severed official ties with Taipei. 
  No problems could be really solved if the mainland continued 
the "you die, I live" mentality in dealing with Taiwan, Kao 
warned. 
  The Chinese communists drove the Nationalist troops to 
Taiwan 
in 1949 in a civil war and still claims sovereignty over the 
island. Beijing has barred other countries from making any major 
arms sales to or forging diplomatic ties with Taiwan which it 
considers part of its territory. 
  Tang had planned to visit Taiwan last month, but the trip 
was 
cancelled after talks in Taipei failed to reach an agreement on 
the thorny issue of repatriating Chinese hijackers to the 
mainland. 
  The hijacking issue and fishing disputes were major 
obstacles 
to the successful conclusion of the three previous rounds of 
talks between the two semi-official bodies which also got bogged 
down on jurisdiction and sovereignty. 
  A spate of 10 hijackings in 1993 added a new soure of 
friction between Beijing and Taipei which have both claimed to 
be the legitimate government of all China since the communists 
forced the nationalists to flee to Taiwan in 1949 following a 
civil war on the mainland. 
  ARATS closed a two-day meeting in Beijing Thursday during 
which it decided to establish a new economic department to 
respond to increasing economic and trade relations across the 
Taiwan Strait. 
  SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 as nominally private 
bodies 
to get around Taiwan's 44-year-old policy of no direct contact 
with Beijing.

"Heilongjiang Province Yields Record Grain Output in 1993"] 
  [Text] In the year that has just passed, the total grain 
yield in Heilongjiang Province reached 23.9 billion kg, the 
highest record in history. 
  The provincial party committee and government in 
Heilongjiang 
always place the development of agriculture and the 
solidification and expansion of the country's "huge granary" in 
Heilongjiang in a position of paramount importance, from which a 
complete set of work ideas and specific measures has been 
formed. They have paid serious attention to the construction of 
agricultural infrastructure. In 1993, nearly 100 million yuan 
was invested in farmland capital construction so that the entire 
province boasts an annual production capability of more than 
22.5 billion kg. Moreover, they persisted in invigorating 
agriculture through the application of scientific and 
technological advances and disseminated advanced technology. In 
the area of education, more than 4 million young and middle-aged 
peasants were trained through various channels in 1993 so that 
there is a crack hand in the farming line in every household. 
The building of the service sector has been intensified, and 
the former emphasis on technical services has been shifted to an 
emphasis on supplying the means of production and helping 
peasants sell their grain in an effort to resolve the tough 
problems facing the peasants. In order to solve the problem of 
having difficulty selling grain after bumper harvests, leading 
cadres from prefectures, cities, and counties personally went to 
various localities across the country to set up a marketing 
network, an example of which is the secretary of the Qingan 
county party committee, who succeeded in selling grain to 
Beijing. The provincial party committee and government also 
tried by every possible means to resolve the problem of "IOU 
notes." In a bid to lighten peasants' burdens, over 600 
improper apportionments have been rectified; 48,000 
nonproductive personnel in villages, towns, and townships have 
been laid off; and reserve funds and the unified budget for the 
entire province has been reduced by 4.9 percent, which is lower 
than that stipulated by the State Council. All this has greatly 
released peasants' enthusiasm so that the province's grain yield 
has exceeded 22.5 billion kg for four consecutive years. 
  The public will is stable thanks to adequate grain. Over the 
past couple of months, monthly sales of grain throughout the 
province have stabilized at about 250 million kg, the market 
price has never reached the ceiling set by the state, and the 
phenomenon of panic buying has never occurred in the entire 
province. A leading cadre from the provincial authorities told 
this reporter: "At present, the province has 10 billion kg of 
grain in stock, and is ready to offer full assistance to any 
fraternal province or city which is in difficulty."

  [Text] The government has turned up the heat on Hong 
Kong's lawmakers to keep the new airport project afloat despite 
renewed threats from China that unilateral action would threaten 
future negotiations on the project. 
  Legislators reserved a final decision on the airport funding 
crisis yesterday, prompting the government to push ahead with 
its own decision this weekend. The government also refused to 
reveal its long-term contingency plan for airport financing 
despite growing fears that more taxpayers' money would be 
injected into the project if China called off future talks. 
  The government will make a final decision this weekend on 
funding options, but has indicated it favours the injection of 
an additional $1.6 billion to pay for urgent construction 
projects. 
  Legislators and the Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) 
were 
presented with two options yesterday to keep the airport on 
schedule pending an agreement with China on the financing 
arrangements. 
  Although Hong Kong's main political parties reserved their 
final decision, the government will narrow down the choice this 
weekend. The options include an extra $377 million in funding to 
keep the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) operating during 
1994-95, or the injection of an additional $1.6 billion to pay 
for urgent design and construction work. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin warned that 
the 
injection of additional funding without China's approval would 
threaten future airport negotiations. "Unilateral action will do 
no good to the settlement of the financial arrangements," he 
said. 
  Governor Chris Patten rejected China's suggestion that the 
British side simply put more equity into the associated railway 
project. He said this would only be "bite-size" relief, and 
that the only cost-effective option was to reach agreement on 
the overall financing strategy. 
  Treasury Secretary Donald Tsang said many legislators 
appeared to favour going it alone on the $1.6 billion additional 
funding but admitted there were "mixed" reactions from ACC 
members. Tsang said the government would monitor the response 
from legislators and the public before making a decision at the 
weekend. "I hope that over the weekend we will come to a 
recommendation that will be put to the Finance Committee," Tsang 
said. "At present the proposal may not be the ideal scenario 
but we have to take the feeling of the Hong Kong people into 
account." 
  Tsang said the government had not decided whether to brief 
China on the proposal before it was put to the Legislative 
Council. While many legislators appeared to favour the 
government's preferred alternative, only a handful indicated 
they would support either option. 
  The major parties, the United Democrats, the Liberal Party 
and Meeting Point, said they would consult parts members before 
making a decision. Tsang refused to be drawn on government 
contingency plans should China call off further talks on the 
airport. Tsang stressed that the first priority was to reach 
agreement with China through the Airport Committee. 
  Four independent legislators, Jimmy McGregor Emily Lau, 
Vincent Cheng and Eric Li supported the injection of $1.6 
billion to keep major contracts on line. 
  Liberal Party legislator Howard Young and pro-China 
legislator Tam Yiu-chung said they preferred the less extreme 
option of keeping the PAA operating.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 13 (XINHUA) -- With the 
deepening of reforms, this capital of south China's Guangdong 
Province is making new efforts to improve the relations between 
labor and capital. 
  In Guangzhou today, more and more enterprises under various 
economic ownerships are taking shape, including over 6,000 
foreign-funded enterprises. They make labor-capital relations 
more complex, according to Du Meixian, vice president of the 
Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions. 
  To effectively protect the interests of both sides, the city 
government is hammering out relevant regulations and setting up 
supervision and arbitration organizations. Trade unions inside 
enterprises are playing their part in mediating disputes. 
  In 1993, the city government worked out a decree which set 
the minimum worker's salary at 250 yuan a month. 
  On the other hand, the city advocates workers associating 
themselves more closely with the rise and fall of their 
enterprises. 
  Every year, the city will commend a large number of 
outstanding workers, factory directors, company managers and 
trade union leaders.

  [Excerpts] The 130-km-long Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway 
with a total investment of 1.38 billion yuan the Nanchang bridge 
has been completed. The opening ceremony for the bridge and the 
Nanchang- Jiaoqiao section of the expressway was held at the 
bridgehead this morning. Among those present at the opening 
ceremony were Mao Zhiyong [provincial party secretary], Wu 
Guanzheng [governor], Zhu Zhihong, and Lu Xiuzhen. Wu Guanzheng 
spoke. [passage omitted] 
  The construction of the Nanchang bridge started in September 
1989. [passage omitted] The Nanchang bridge starts from the 
Tandekou flyover and ends in Changleng Township, totaling nine 
km long. This bridge is the main channel between northern and 
western Jiangxi. 
  In his speech, Governor Wu Guanzheng said: In January last 
year, the Jiaoqiao-Jiujiang section on the Nanchang-Jiujiang 
expressway opened to traffic; now the Nanchang bridge and the 
Nanchang-Jiaoqiao section on the Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway 
have opened. This is another major achievement in our 
province's basic facilities construction and will play a major 
role in promoting Jiangxi's opening up and economic development. 
[passage omitted] 
  Projects now under construction in the province include 
seven 
power stations, five railways, three airports, six tunnels, 19 
reservoirs, 200,000-gate program-control telephone equipment, 
and 10 fiber-optic cable projects. This year we will proceed 
with ten major projects including power stations in Fengcheng 
and Jiujiang, the Chang Jiang bridge in Jiujiang, the 
Jiujiang-Hukou expressway, the Hukou bridge, a new railway 
station in Nanchang, a new airport in Nanchang, and 600,000-gate 
program-control telephone equipment, requiring a total 
investment of over 13 billion yuan. Following the completion of 
these projects, the bottleneck situation in basic facilities 
will be greatly alleviated, the investment environment will 
greatly improve, and economic development power will also 
greatly increase. 
  Wu Guanzheng hoped that comrades participating in the 
construction of these projects would continue to display their 
indomitable spirit, closely cooperate with each other, and make 
great achievements in basic facilities construction.

  [Excerpts] The Henan Provincial CPC Committee yesterday 
afternoon invited some non-CPC persons to a forum at which it 
solicited their views on two documents adopted at the recently 
concluded Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan Provincial 
CPC Committee. 
  Provincial leaders, including Li Changchun [provincial party 
secretary], Ren Keli, Fan Qinchen, and others attended the forum 
presided over by Hu Shujian, director of the provincial party 
committee united front work department and vice chairman of the 
provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
Committee. 
  Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Li Changchun first took 
the floor at the forum by briefing the non-CPC personages on the 
recently concluded Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee. 
  Secretary Li Changchun also expressed the hope that all of 
the non-CPC personages attending the forum would show utter 
devotion, freely speak out, and put forth views so that the two 
documents adopted at the aforementioned plenary session could be 
amended. The two documents are: "The Henan Provincial CPC 
Committee Opinions on Implementing the CPC Central Committee 
Decision on Building a Socialist Market Economic Structure" and 
"The Henan Provincial CPC Committee Work Report." 
  In their speeches, all of the non-CPC personages unanimously 
agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee had been held at an appropriate moment, 
the two documents adopted at the plenary session are of overall 
guiding significance to Henan's work, and the work report 
delivered at the plenary session by Secretary Li Changchun on 
behalf of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee had realistically 
summed up Henan's work in 1993 and laid down both goals and 
guiding principles for Henan's work in 1994. [passage omitted] 
  After conscientiously listening to a series of views voiced 
by the non-CPC personages, Li Changchun stressed: As we are to 
build a socialist market economy in 1994, we will certainly come 
across many more problems. However, the crux of the matter lies 
in economic growth. We should strive to develop the economy on 
the one hand and cut down outlays on the other. I hope that all 
non-CPC personages present at this forum will join hands in 
putting forth views and proposals aimed at speeding up Henan's 
development.

  [Excerpts] Delivering a speech at a provincial meeting on 
rural work which closed yesterday, Governor Ma Zhongchen 
stressed that it is necessary to guide rural economic work with 
the concepts and methods of the market economy, and further 
emancipate and develop the productive forces in rural areas. 
The idea of increasing peasants' income and gradually improving 
peasants' material and cultural lives must be taken as the 
starting point and objective of our rural economic work. 
  Present at yesterday's provincial meeting on rural work were 
provincial party and government leaders Li Changchun [provincial 
party secretary], Ma Zhongchen, Ren Keli, Song Zhaosu, Wu 
Guangxian, Zheng Zengmao, Song Guochen, Zhang Deguang, Fan 
Qinchen, Ma Jianzhan, Zhang Wenbin, Zhong Lisheng, Li Chengyi, 
Zhang Honghua, Yu Jiahua, Yao Zhongmin, Tu Jiaji, Ren Weiyuan, 
and Yuan Nong. 
  Song Zhaosu, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the meeting. 
  In his closing speech, Governor Ma Zhongchen pointed out: In 
order to give correct guidance to rural economic work, it is 
necessary to break away from outdated concepts and conventional 
methods of thinking, but adopt new concepts and new methods of 
thinking on the market economy, and to learn how to guide rural 
economic work with these concepts and methods of thinking on the 
market economy. [passage omitted] 
  To conclude his speech, Ma Zhongchen said: The idea of 
increasing the peasants' income and gradually improving their 
material and cultural lives must be made the starting point and 
objective of rural economic work. It is necessary to correctly 
handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability; to study harder; and, in particular, to protect and 
give full play to initiative on the part of cadres at the 
grass-roots level and the broad masses of people. Various local 
authorities, when implementing the guidelines laid down by this 
meeting, must conscientiously sum up their own good experience, 
straighten out their thinking, continue to work in a 
down-to-earth manner, and strive hard to speed up the 
development of the market economy in the rural areas of Henan 
province.

  [Text] In 1993, our province seized the opportunity, 
forged ahead with an enterprising spirit, made further progress 
in reform and opening up, and attained rapid growth of its 
economy. In a current situation report delivered to various 
circles yesterday morning [7 January], the provincial 
statistical bureau pointed out: According to preliminary 
estimates, the provincial GDP for the year 1993 was 145.4 
billion yuan, up 15.2 percent over 1992, making it one of the 
three years in which the growth rate exceeded 15 percent since 
reform and opening up began. 
  Sustained and speedy growth of the economy has significantly 
increased the composite strength of this province. Last year, 
party and government leaders at various levels paid more 
attention to agriculture and set forth a series of policies for 
increasing input into agriculture, consolidating the status of 
agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and reducing 
burdens on peasants. The role of the market in guiding 
agricultural production has been strengthened. Thanks to all 
this, plus favorable weather conditions, total yields of grain 
and oil reached record highs. The grain output was 35 billion 
kg, an increase of over 10 percent; the output of oil-bearing 
crops increased by 42.3 percent; and that of cotton equalled the 
previous year. 
  Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery 
developed steadily. The total output value of agriculture is 
estimated at 67.5 billion yuan. Township and town enterprises 
showed a strong momentum of growth. Rural economic development 
was well rounded. 
  Industrial production grew rapidly, with a good balance 
between production and marketing. The total industrial output 
value for the year is estimated to exceed [figure indistinct], 
up more than 20 percent. The growth rate at and above the 
township level was 21 percent and the production-to-marketing 
rate was 96 percent. The growth rate of non-state-run industry 
was far higher than that of state-run industry. 
  After the power of investment [words indistinct] was 
delegated to lower levels, localities were enthusiastic in 
investment. The total investment in fixed assets is estimated 
at 42.4 billion yuan, up more than 30 percent. This rate is 
nearly eight percentage points higher than 1992. Key projects 
made smooth progress. 
  The consumer goods market province-wide maintained a surplus 
of supply. Commodities were in abundant supply and marketing 
was basically stable, showing brisk movement. Consumption in 
urban areas had a quick growth, while rural markets were picking 
up at a faster pace. The general index of retail prices was 
basically stable, with a tendency to rise. The increase rate is 
estimated at 10 percent, the lowest among 30 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions. 
  In addition, the monetary order in this province is 
approaching normality, and revenue kept increasing from month to 
month in the fourth quarter. Utilization of foreign capital 
increased by a big margin. The living standards of urban and 
rural people were further upgraded. 
  The provincial statistical bureau pointed out: The economic 
performance of our province in 1993 has laid a foundation and 
accumulated experience for the development in 1994. As long as 
we conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, handle well the 
relationship among reform, development, and stability, and 
strengthen monitoring of economic operation, we are bound to be 
able to realize the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
growth of the whole province this year.

  [Text] Wuhan, January 15 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province will make great efforts to achieve "breakthrough" 
progress in the development of its export-oriented economy this 
year. 
  According to a target worked out by the provincial 
government 
for export-oriented economy, the province will earn more than 
two billion U.S. dollars from exports this year. 
  It will also approve the establishment of about 1,500 new 
foreign-funded enterprises, and the use of foreign investment is 
set at over one billion U.S. dollars. Output value and earnings 
from sales for existing operational foreign-funded enterprises 
in the province are fixed at over four billion yuan each. 
  At a provincial economic working meeting held recently, Jia 
Zhijie, governor of the province, urged local officials from 
relevant departments to seize the current opportunity for 
developing the economy and to intensify the opening-up drive, in 
order to realize the target for the development of 
export-oriented economy in the province. 
  At present, Wuhan, the provincial capital, Huangshi and 
Yichang cities, all on the Chang Jiang River, have been approved 
by the State Council to be open cities. 
  An increasing number of international consortiums and 
transnational companies are investing in these open cities, as 
the implementation of the state's strategy for opening and 
developing areas along the Chang Jiang River and the preparatory 
work of the world's second largest dam at the Three Gorges 
continues. 
  To meet the set target of this year, the governor also urged 
different localities to strengthen the construction of export- 
oriented industries and bases and bring the initiatives of all 
sides into play in developing export-oriented economy, ensuring 
quick and stable increases in exports. 
  While drawing up regulations and policies to encourage 
development of export-oriented economic activities, different 
localities should also broaden the rational use of foreign funds 
and strive hard to help the local economy adapt to the 
international economy, said the governor. 
  He also called for the establishment of an authorized 
leading 
group for the work of developing export-oriented economy and 
simplifying procedures of approval for overseas investors to set 
up businesses.

  [Text] Addressing a provincial meeting on united front 
work which closed the day before yesterday, provincial party 
committee Secretary Liu Fangren emphasized: As far as the 
united front work is concerned, we in this province should 
follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, give full play 
to those basic social functions exclusive to united front work, 
make use of every positive factor, unite with all the forces 
that can be united, and do our share to consolidate and promote 
the great solidarity among all the nationalities of this 
province and to fulfill the province's second- stage strategic 
goal for the 1990's. 
  Liu Fangren pointed out that the province at present should 
devote great efforts to the following aspects with regard to 
united front work: 
  1. It is necessary to uphold and perfect the multi-party 
cooperation and political consultation system under the CPC's 
leadership, and to do a really good job in fostering, selecting, 
appointing, and employing non-CPC personalities. Party 
committees, governments, and organs concerned at all levels must 
wholeheartedly and effectively serve democratic parties and 
other non-CPC personalities in all circles and help them solve 
actual problems. 
  2. It is necessary to work really hard to win the support of 
representative personalities of the nonpublic economic sector, 
with a view to promoting the development of the non-state-owned 
economy in the province. 
  3. It is necessary to attach great importance to nationality 
and religious affairs. Party committees and governments at all 
levels must take the initiative in selecting, fostering, and 
employing cadres from minority nationalities in accordance with 
the guideline laid down in the documents concerned issued by the 
central authorities. To do a good job in handling religious 
affairs, all localities must comprehensively implement the 
party's policy toward religions and should do a better job in 
safeguarding normal religious activities. At the same time, all 
localities must make greater efforts to do a still better job in 
united front work abroad, to extend the united front, to unite 
with the vast number of Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao 
compatriots, and overseas Chinese, thus contributing to the 
economic development of the province. 
  In his speech, Liu Fangren demanded that party committees at 
all levels strengthen leadership over united front work, really 
attach great importance to united front work, and place it on 
important agenda, thus making greater contributions to the 
economic prosperity of the province.

  [Text] Chongqing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The economic 
section under the Sichuan intermediate court, with the task of 
handling economic disputes involving overseas clients, was set 
up today in Chongqing, the largest economic center in southwest 
China. 
  This overseas-related economic court is the first of its 
kind 
founded in Sichuan Province. 
  Along with the expanding of reform and opening, more and 
more 
economic disputes have surfaced involving foreign-funded 
enterprises and Sino-foreign joint ventures as well as investors 
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  By the end of last year, the city had 1,300 overseas-funded 
businesses. 
  Early in 1977, China's first economic court was set up in 
Chongqing. The Sichuan intermediate court began to prepare for 
the foundation of an economic court to handle disputes involving 
overseas clients April last year. 
  During the preparatory period, the court took up 19 economic 
cases, involving 37 million yuan and 2.3 million U.S. dollars.

  [Excerpts] The Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and 
provincial government yesterday called a provincial meeting on 
family planning. Governor He Zhiqiang addressed the meeting, 
stressing that all local authorities in the province must 
further intensify family planning, tighten control over 
population growth, improve the quality of the population, and 
strive hard for the sustained and wholesome economic development 
of the province. 
  In his speech, He Zhiqiang first iterated the necessity of 
correctly evaluating the situation in family planning work in 
the province. He said that over the past few years, party 
committees and governments at all levels in this province have 
conscientiously implemented instructions prescribed in the 
relevant documents issued by the central authorities and the 
State Council, as well as Yunnan Province's regulations on 
family planning, and have introduced a stable policy toward 
child bearing, thus basically checking the trend of excessively 
high population growth. However, we must also be clearly aware 
that our province is facing a grim situation regarding 
population growth. At present, we are in the third baby boom, 
with the population of married women of child-bearing age 
continuing to increase. In addition, our province has scarce 
human resources to attend to family planning at the grass-roots 
level, and birth control is particularly difficult in minority 
nationality areas and impoverished areas. Therefore, we are 
undertaking very arduous tasks. 
  He Zhiqiang pointed out that the population issue is both a 
social and economic issue. Since reform and opening up, our 
province has enjoyed relatively rapid economic growth. From 
1989 to 1992, our province's gross industrial and agricultural 
output value increased by a wider margin than the average 
standard in the country. However, because of excessive 
population growth, our province's aggregate per-capita economic 
growth is 14 percentage points lower than the national average. 
Therefore, local governments at all levels must ensure that the 
principle of paying attention to both production and population 
growth is embodied in strategic planning and actual work. We 
must carry out family planning with real earnest as if we are 
dealing with the issues of economic construction, reform and 
opening, and social progress so as to ensure a harmonious 
balance between population growth and economic and social 
development. [passage omitted] 
  During the meeting, Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng delivered 
a 
speech entitled: Sum up Experiences, Make Persistent Efforts, 
and Lifting our Province's Family Planning Work to a New Level. 
  Liang Jinquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over yesterday's meeting. Also present at 
the meeting were Yang Ming, vice chairman of the provincial 
people's congress standing committee; Chen Liying, vice 
chairwoman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference provincial committee; and former leading persons of 
the provincial authorities, (Gao Zhiguo) and Li Guiying.

  [Text] A provincial meeting on three reforms opened in 
Kunming yesterday. 
  He Zhiqiang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor, addressed the meeting. 
  He Zhiqiang first briefed the meeting participants on the 
progress in the three reforms in the province. He said: 
According to the plan formulated by the central party 
authorities and the State Council, personnel departments and 
bureaus at all levels, in close cooperation with departments 
concerned, have done a great deal of work in regard to 
organizational reform, the reform to introduce the civil service 
system, and the reform of the wage and salary system. These 
reforms have now been started in this province. So far the 
number of provincial-level organizations has been reduced from 
78 to 54, a decrease of 30 percent; the number of organs that 
form the provincial government has been reduced from 46 to 36; 
some government organs have been turned into business entities; 
and remarkable results have been scored. 
  He Zhiqiang demanded that the three reforms be carried on 
steadily and properly. He said: As far as organizational 
reform is concerned, the general target is that reform of party 
and government organs at all levels should be accomplished in 
the first half of this year; as for the organizational reform 
for prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party 
committees, pilot projects will be conducted in the first half 
of this year, and the reform will be gradually expanded on a 
larger scale in the second half of the year and be completed in 
the first half of next year; the organizational reform at the 
county level will be widely launched after the Spring Festival, 
and will be accomplished in the first half of next year; while 
the organizational reform at the township and town level will be 
carried out according to documents issued by the provincial 
party committee. Wherever it is possible to speed up the 
reform, the authorities concerned should try to accomplish it 
ahead of schedule. 
  With regard to the civil service system, the operation 
should 
be carried out in accordance with the central party authorities 
and the State Council's plan concerning the civil service system 
and the provincial authorities' proposal on specific, relevant 
arrangements. In the process of implementation, for those parts 
of the civil service-related reform which cannot go on without 
organizational reform, pilot projects must be launched before 
the reform proper is fully started. All executive organs that 
have completed the three fixing procedures [fixing of the 
organizational structure, post- specific duties and functions, 
and staff size] must promptly introduce some practices of the 
civil service system, such as establishment of posts, the 
personnel transition process, personnel appointments, and 
assignment of positions to ensure that the new system will soon 
operate along the new track. The province must strive to finish 
establishing the civil service system in three years. 
  With regard to reform of the wage and salary system, He 
Zhiqiang said: The current wage and salary system reform is to 
meet the needs of the market economy structure and is for the 
purpose of deepening the reform of the personnel system. Every 
effort has been made to ensure that consideration is given to 
every aspect of the interests of professional and technical 
personnel, retired personnel, persons with honorary posts, 
demobilized servicemen, those who are laid off in the wake of 
the organizational reform, and grassroots staff. All localities 
must follow nationwide standardized regulations governing the 
wage and salary system, pay policy, and the pay scale. No 
locality may arbitrarily change the practices under any pretext 
of special local needs. It is required that all localities 
shall carry out the package reform strictly according to the 
policy. Specific remaining problems will be cautiously dealt 
with after investigations and study. 
  In order to accomplish the three reforms, He Zhiqiang urged 
party committees and governments at all levels to set great 
store by and intensify leadership, personnel departments at all 
levels to do a meticulous job in implementing the operation, and 
departments concerned to give strong support to them, to 
cooperate closely with them, and to work hard on their part to 
accomplish the reforms. 
  During yesterday's meeting, provincial personnel department 
director Li Mingyou delivered a report entitled: Advance Our 
Province's Personnel Work to a New Stage With the Three Reforms 
as the Key Links.

<F P=106> [By Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Emancipate the Mind, </F>
Seize the Opportunity To Accelerate Reform and Opening Up, 
Expedite Economic Development, and Strive To Achieve A Fairly 
Comfortable Standard of Living Three Years Ahead of Schedule"] 
  [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Beijing 
Municipal CPC Committee was held on 29 December. Attending the 
session were Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, Zhang Jianmin, Wang Daming, 
Li Zhijian, Chen Guangwen, and 47 members and 10 alternate 
members of the municipal party committee. Attending as 
observers were members and alternate members of the party 
Central Committee and members of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, who were from Beijing; vice chairmen of 
the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference; vice mayors and advisers to the 
municipal government; secretary and deputy secretaries of the 
municipal discipline inspection commission; deputy secretary 
general of the municipal party committee; major responsible 
persons of the various departments, committees, and offices of 
the municipal party committee; and secretaries of district and 
county party committees. 
  Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
presided over the session. 
  That morning, Comrade Li Qiyan gave a report to give 
opinions 
on implementation of the guidelines of the national economic 
work conference and on initial arrangements for Beijing's 1994 
reform and development. 
  The report said: Since the beginning of this year, the 
people throughout the municipality have conscientiously studied 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, adhered to the party's basic line, and, 
proceeding from Beijing's reality, have further emancipated the 
mind, adopted new ideas and large-scale measures to accelerate 
reform and opening up in all sectors, and developed the economy 
in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Comprehensive 
fulfillment of the target of "making this year's work surpass 
last year's" as defined by the municipal party committee and 
people's congress early this year has become a certainty, and a 
good foundation has been laid for next year's reform and 
development. Some major manifestations follow: 
  1) The economy has developed in a rapid, healthy, and 
orderly 
manner in the process of accelerating the transition to the 
market economy. 2) Urban construction has been expedited, and 
eye-catching changes have taken place in urban and rural areas. 
3) Science and technology, education, and other social 
undertakings have developed comprehensively. 4) Urban and rural 
people's living standards have been promoted to new heights. 5) 
New breakthroughs have been achieved in the reform focusing on 
establishing the socialist market economy system and 
transforming enterprises' operating mechanism. 6) The endeavor 
of opening to the outside world has been promoted to an 
unprecedented range and quality. In addition to the new 
achievements in economic development, reform, and opening up, 
notable results have also been won in building the socialist 
spiritual civilization, improving the legal system, and building 
a clean government. In general, down-to-earth and effective 
work of this year has laid a good foundation and created a new 
opportunity for Beijing's economy to develop rapidly based on a 
new starting point next year. 
  Speaking on the initial arrangements for next year's 
economic 
work, Li Qiyan pointed out in his report: Next year will be an 
extremely important year for comprehensively implementing the 
decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee and accelerating the establishment of the socialist 
market economy system. It will also be a crucial year to 
accelerating Beijing's socialist modernization and achieving the 
fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of 
schedule. The basic idea for Beijing's economic work is to 
emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity to accelerate reform 
and opening up, expedite economic development, and strive to 
achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living three years 
ahead of schedule. We should emphasize the following work: 
  A. We should speed up the establishment of the socialist 
market economy system, with the focus on establishing the modern 
enterprise system and the system for macroeconomic regulation 
and control. Next year's reform should focus on transforming 
enterprises' operating mechanism and establishing a modern 
enterprise system, and efforts should be made to achieve 
substantial progress. Meanwhile, focusing on the reform of the 
financial and tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade 
systems, we should establish more rapidly the systems for 
macroeconomic regulation and control and change the government 
function of economic administration. 
  B. We should open wider to the outside world and make a new 
breakthrough in using foreign capital. We should continue to 
regard use of foreign capital as the most important part of the 
endeavor of opening to the outside world, expand the scope of 
the endeavor, open more fields to the outside world, and improve 
the level. While adhering to the principle of "developing 
large, medium-sized, and small projects simultaneously," we 
should particularly draw in funds from international 
multi-national companies and consortia to build large key 
projects when bringing in funds from abroad. 
  C. We should optimize the industrial composition, improve 
economic efficiency, and maintain the good trend of rapid 
development in urban and rural economies. 
  D. We must have the greatest determination and make the 
greatest efforts in accelerating the construction of urban 
infrastructure facilities and raise the level of modernization 
in urban and rural areas. We should mobilize the efforts of all 
sectors and comprehensively advance the "well-off housing 
project" because this is one of the important links for 
realizing the goal of having the whole municipality become 
well-off ahead of schedule. 
  E. We should give play to the advantages of the capital and 
accelerate scientific and technological progress and the 
training of personnel. 
  The report points out: In order to smoothly fulfill all 
fields of work during next year, leading cadres at all levels 
should first solve the following major issues of understanding. 
First, we should further emancipate the mind. The priority is 
to further emancipate the mind in four aspects, including how to 
cope with the economic development rate, what standards to use 
to judge the realization of the goal of becoming well-off, how 
to recognize macroeconomic regulation and control under the 
socialist market economic conditions and how to expand the 
spheres of using foreign capital. Second, we should firmly seize 
the current opportunity and have a high sense of historical 
responsibility and urgency towards this. Third, we should 
correctly handle the relations of reform, opening up, economic 
development and social stability. We should pay particular 
attention to maintaining stability and never slacken our guard 
in this issue. Fourth, we should realistically improve work 
style and strengthen the building of honest and diligent 
administration. Fifth, we must pay high attention to and 
realistically strengthen study. It is necessary to use Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to arm the the minds of cadres at all levels. 
We should soberly recognize that we are still not familiar with 
the socialist market economy. We must study honestly and 
sincerely and thoroughly understand the guidelines of the 
central authorities and the content of a series of reform plans. 
  In the afternoon, Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the 
municipal party committee, gave a report to the plenary session 
on the situation of anticorruption work since the past four 
months. 
  Since the issuance of the anticorruption work plans 
formulated by the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government in line with the guidelines of the second plenary 
session of the central Discipline Inspection Commission and 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech in September, the municipality has 
achieved initial results in its anticorruption struggle and 
implemented the three tasks on anticorruption struggle raised by 
the State Council. 1) In line with the demand of the municipal 
party committee and the municipal government, leading bodies at 
and above the section level across the municipality have held 
democratic life meetings on schedule, conducted self-insepction 
and correction in line with the "11 prohibitions" stipulated in 
the five central principles and briefed the situation to the 
masses. 2) We have concentrated efforts on the investigation 
and handling of a batch of major and appalling cases. In the 
past four months, the procuratorial organs across the 
municipality filed 263 economic cases on corruption and bribery 
for investigation; the courts sentenced 35 criminals involving 
in four groups and appalling cases, of whom, 25 criminals were 
sentenced to more than 10-years of imprisonment and 22 were 
sentenced to death and made their cases known to the public. 3) 
We have achieved great results in clearing up the work of 
arbitrarily collecting service charges. As of 10 December, the 
whole municipality had cleared up a total of 586 cases of this 
category. 4) We have comprehensively conducted the work of 
relentlessly checking several unhealthy trends which the masses 
have strong complaints. The unhealthy trend of using public 
funds to travel outside the country (territory) has been 
basically checked; business and enterprises involving party and 
government organs and the establishment of organs that need 
payment for providing consulting services have been initially 
banned; and new progress has been made in the work of rectifying 
work style of telecommunications departments and railway system. 
5) We have closely combined anticorruption with clean and 
diligent administration and made honest administration to 
promote diligent administration. 
  In referring to the next step of anticorruption struggle, 
Chen Guangwen proposed: It is necessary to continuously uphold 
the principles of persisting in "taking a two-handed approach 
and be tough with both," "first be resolute, second, be 
persistent, and third, achieving expected results," and exert 
great efforts to grasp them well. We must not overestimate the 
achivements we have made or neglect the existing problems or 
lower our guard on this. In the morning, the committee members 
also held group discussions on Comrade Li Qiyan's report. At 
the end of the session, Chen Guangwen gave a summing-up speech.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton have 
pledged mutual support in a document signed here today. 
  Yeltsin offered to back the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" 
proposal which would gradually incorporate Eastern European 
nations into NATO, and Clinton has committed his support for 
further reforms in Russia. 
  Citing the U.S. proposal as an important element in the new 
architecture of European security, the document said President 
Yeltsin assured President Clinton of Russia's intention to 
become an active partner in and to promote broad, substantial, 
and intensive cooperation with NATO. 
  In their bid to avert further divisions in Europe, the two 
leaders recognized the need to set up a new order of European 
security that is inclusive, non-discriminatory and focused on 
practical political and security cooperation. 
  Yeltsin assured Clinton of the irreversibility of Russia's 
transition toward a market economy and its intention to further 
reforms and address consequent social needs associated with the 
transition. 
  Clinton reaffirmed his strong support for Russia's reform 
and 
suggested that social issues could be a new and promising area 
for cooperation. 
  In the agreement, the two presidents pledged that the two 
countries will stop targeting their strategic nuclear missiles 
at each other by this June, thereby ending nearly fifty years of 
conflict between the two superpowers. 
  Clinton and Yeltsin urged all countries to renounce nuclear 
testing and observe the requirements of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  They also denounced "aggressive nationalism and political 
extremism," which in their words are "the main threat to peace 
and democracy today." 
  Other issues addressed in the agreement were the attainment 
of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, 
the progress achieved in the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks, and 
the talks between Syria and Israel. 
  Russian media hailed the declaration as the most important 
of 
all Russian-American agreements.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin said today that the U.S. proposal on establishing 
a "partnership for peace" with former Eastern Bloc countries may 
prove only "one of the scenarios for building a new Europe." 
  Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. President 
Bill 
Clinton, Yeltsin said Russia will "keep track" of other security 
structures in Europe, including the United Nations and the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  Yeltsin also said that one should not be fearful of 
"imperial 
ambitions" in Russia, because Russia is only interested in 
stability, and will try to eliminate the chance of conflict 
along the new borders between former Soviet republics. 
  He complained of the failure of some countries to respond to 
Russia's proposal for ending the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh 
and Tajikstan. 
  Yeltsin also warned that a "double standard" should not be 
used by Western countries in their relations with Russia and the 
Baltic republics. 
  "No double standard should be allowed here... in Haiti or 
the 
Baltics," he said. "To that end we adopted a very forceful 
declaration on securing human rights... so that no more 
discrimination will be allowed against the Russian-speaking 
population in the Baltics."

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jan (XINHUA) -- During his meeting with 
former U.S. President George Bush at Zhongnanhai this morning, 
President Jiang Zemin said that China and the United States have 
differences but that in the final analysis [gui gen dao di 2981 
2704 0451 1646], Sino-U.S. relations should improve. 
  Jiang Zemin told Bush: Great changes have taken place in 
China since your last visit to China. A stable, developing, and 
prosperous China is not only in line with the interests of the 
Chinese people but also with those of the American people and 
the world at large. It is impossible for China to have 
stability and development without world peace and development. 
On the other hand, world peace and development also need 
stability and development in China. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Both China and the United States 
are influential countries on the world scene. They share 
extensive common interests and shoulder heavy responsibilities 
in safeguarding world peace and stability, and in working for 
common development and prosperity. Although differences exist 
between us, in the final analysis, Sino-U.S. relations should 
improve. This meets the needs of world peace and development 
and accords with the wishes of the people of China and the 
United States as well as of people throughout the world." 
  Bush said that he was pleased to see the significant changes 
that have taken place in Beijing. He stressed that U.S.-Chinese 
relations are very, very important, adding that to safeguard and 
strengthen such ties accords with the common interests of the 
two sides. 
  Present at the meeting were Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu 
and Scowcroft, former national security adviser to the U.S. 
president. 
  After the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, President 
Jiang Zemin and Mr. Bush took a brief walk in a small garden of 
Zhongnanhai. During their conversation, Jiang Zemin asked Bush 
to visit China more often in the future. Bush replied that he 
would be glad to do so.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee chairman, met here 
today with Richard Gephardt, majority leader of the U.S. House 
of Representatives. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that the 
Chinese NPC and the U.S. Congress would enhance exchanges and 
cooperation with each other and make joint efforts to promote 
the healthy growth of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  During the meeting, Qiao Shi extended his warm welcome to 
Gephardt and his delegation. He said: The November 1993 
meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President 
Clinton in Seattle was a new start in bilateral relations. 
Since their meeting, many U.S. congressmen have visited China. 
Such visits have helped promote the U.S. Congress's 
understanding of the situation in various fields of China and 
have provided opportunities for the two sides to exchange views 
on issues of common concern. 
  On the issue of the most-favored-nation [MFN] trading 
status, 
Qiao said that the MFN treatment is an arrangement of equity and 
mutual benefit between China and the United States. He 
emphasized that China opposes linking the MFN treatment with 
issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as the human 
rights issue. He said he hoped that the MFN issue would be 
resolved "once and for all." 
  Qiao Shi said: During the new period, a sound political, 
economic, and trade relationship between the two countries is in 
line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is 
conducive to world peace and development. 
  Gephardt said: U.S.-Chinese relations are "most essential" 
to the two countries and to the rest of the world as well. 
Dialogue and exchanges would improve U.S.-Chinese ties. The 
United States hopes that progress will be achieved in bilateral 
relations in the period to come. 
  The U.S. guests arrived in China on 12 January at the 
invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. 
Liu Shuqing, president of the institute, was present at today's 
meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, January 15 (XINHUA) -- China's President 
Jiang Zemin said this afternoon at Zhongnanhai that China 
welcomes more congressmen visiting the country and hopes they 
will do more to enhance mutual understanding and to improve ties 
between China and the United States. 
  Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with a visiting U.S. 
six-member delegation from the House of Representatives, led by 
majority leader Richard Gephardt. 
  The U.S. Congress has a unique role to play in the making of 
U.S. domestic and foreign policies, Jiang said, adding that it 
can exert its influence in promoting the development of 
Sino-U.S. ties. 
  Since last year, more than 100 U.S. congressmen have visited 
China. Jiang said that the visits would help them to learn 
about China's real situation and to make right decisions 
regarding Sino-U.S. ties. 
  The past few years have witnessed fruitful Sino-U.S. 
economic 
and trade cooperation, he said, and it has been proved that 
China and the U.S. are highly complementary to each other in the 
economic and trade fields and they have wide spheres of 
cooperation. 
  Gephardt said that the U.S. and China are two great nations. 
It is of great significance for leaders of the two countries to 
maintain their contacts. He added that active relations looking 
to the future should be developed between the two countries. 
  Gephardt said he learned a lot about China during the 
current 
trip and saw major positive changes in the country's economic 
sphere. 
  The U.S. is looking forward to developing more successful 
and 
closer ties with China, he said. 
  Among those taking part in the meeting were Liu Shuqing, 
president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, 
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and U.S. Ambassador to 
China Stapleton Roy. 
  This morning, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji also met Gephardt and 
the other U.S. congressmen.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter He Chong (6320 3095)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Sino-U.S. 
textiles talks are to be held in Beijing between 15 and 17 
January. This is probably going to be a final showdown 
negotiation. Because the United States suddenly announced 10 
days before the talks that as of 17 January the United States 
will unilaterally cut quotas for 88 kinds of textiles and 
garments imported from China by 25 to 35 percent (worth about 
$1.2 billion to 2 billion) and China also announced that it 
would take retaliatory action accordingly, if these negotiations 
fall through, a trade war may break out immediately. 
  The chance of success of these negotiations is fifty-fifty, 
because the United States, in breach of the international 
practice, brandished the big stick of hegemonism and used the 
so-called "anti-malpractice sections" in its domestic law to try 
to deal a head-on blow at China from the very beginning and 
overpower China even before the talks begin. But China is not a 
weakling and is unlikely to give in to U.S. pressure. If the 
United States unilaterally cuts import quotas for China's 
textiles, China will retaliate by stopping or reducing the 
purchase of U.S. agricultural and industrial products. 
  The previous textiles agreement with China expired at the 
end 
of last year. In order to reach a new agreement, the two sides 
talked three times, in September, November, and December last 
year, all of which came to nothing. During the talks, the U.S. 
side kept accusing the Chinese side of "deliberately" selling 
textiles and garments to the United States by "illegal 
transshipment" via third countries or regions and, in the 
meantime, using others' import quotas, which took up 
approximately one third of the total value. But China kept 
denying these groundless accusations. In its opinion, 
Chinese-made textiles transported o the United States via Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, and Honduras were nothing but transit goods of 
those regions or export goods that had been processed in those 
regions. They were not directly connected with China, nor were 
they exported by China through "illegal transshipment." China 
also demanded the United States produce evidence of "illegal 
transshipment." In answer to this demand, U.S. personnel 
spot-checked Chinese agency companies to the United States in 
New York, only to find no evidence. Later, the United States 
even demanded that China allow U.S. Customs to send personnel to 
the relevant factories in China for "spot investigation." This 
unjustifiable infringement of sovereignty was, of course, flatly 
refused by China. After all that, in order to please its own 
textile and garment manufacturers, the U.S. Government still 
ignored international practice and announced unilateral 
reduction of import quotas for Chinese textiles. 
  An official of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation pointed out: The United States' 
unilaterally slashing quotas for China's textiles imported to 
America is in violation of international and bilateral 
agreements. According to the new agreement concluded at the 
Uruguay round of talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, the textile import quota system of relevant countries 
will be removed by stages within 10 years to make free trade 
possible. But the United States is now using quotas to pressure 
other countries with double strength. Obviously, by so doing 
the United States ignores the spirit of the international 
agreement, violates the provision of the "Multifiber Agreement" 
that the importer concerned can increase its import volume by 6 
percent each year, and does not comply with the principle that 
any dispute between importer and exporter shall be brought to 
the "Textiles Supervision Institution" for arbitration. 
  According to a commentary in "Wall Street Journal" of the 
United States, this textile trade conflict between China and the 
United States "is obviously largely caused by the protectionist 
fever of the U.S. bureaucracy, rather than any wrong doing on 
the part of the Chinese Government." According to analysis, the 
United States is pressuring China on the issue of textiles not 
only to obtain the privilege for sending a "spot-check team" to 
China, but also to launch a skirmish to aid the decision on the 
extension, or otherwise, of most-favored-nation status for China 
in June this year to put additional pressure on China to open 
its market to the United States. 
  China, on the other hand, is prepared for two situations. 
First, it expressed willingness to cooperate with the United 
States in preventing the problem of "illegal transshipments." 
It also agreed to the United States sending a representative to 
Beijing to help China investigate the exportation of textiles to 
the United States by nongovernmental trading companies. But 
under the principle of safeguarding state sovereignty, China 
categorically refused to let the United States send a spot-check 
team to China. In the meantime, China is also prepared for the 
worst. Once the talks break down and the United States cuts 
import quotas, it will announce specific retaliatory measures. 
  If a trade war breaks out between China and the United 
States, Hong Kong will bear the brunt. According to an estimate 
by a Hong Kong businessman, a large portion of the textiles and 
garments exported by China to the United States last year, worth 
a total of $4.7 billion, went through Hong Kong, while Hong Kong 
manufacturers produce or process garments on the mainland and 
export them via Hong Kong. Once the Sino-U.S. talks break down, 
Hong Kong businessmen will suffer a lot. Similarly, U.S. 
importers and retailers will also suffer major losses and 
consumer interests will also be impaired.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 17 (AFP) -- China and the United 
States will sign a new textile quota accord here Monday, a 
Chinese foreign trade ministry spokesman said, following three 
days of intense negotiations aimed at avoiding a possible trade 
war. The details of the accord were not immediately available. 
  The signing coincides with the January 17 deadline set by 
Washington for a bilateral agreement to be reached or for China 
to face quota cuts of up to 35 percent in textile exports to the 
United States. 
  The accord will be signed by Chinese foreign trade minister 
Wu Yi and a U.S. delegation led by Jennifer Hillman, the 
spokesman told AFP, without elaborating on the nature or 
duration of the agreement. The US delegation opened talks with 
the Chinese side here Saturday in a last-ditch attempt to reach 
a new agreement following the expiry of a previous accord on 
December 31. 
  Washington threatened the quota cuts to protest against 
alleged Chinese textile trans-shipments to the United States 
through third countries -- valued at two billion dollars -- in 
violation of the previous quota agreement. China, which feels 
it has been unfairly targetted by Washington, had responded by 
threatening retaliatory action should the United States go ahead 
with the unilateral cuts.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on bilateral 
textile trade agreement here today, thus avoiding a textile 
trade war between the two sides. 
  The agreement was reached with the conclusion of the fourth 
round of negotiations on the issue. 
  Chinese chief textile negotiator and Vice-Minister of 
Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said that during 
the three-day negotiations, the U.S. side agreed not to insist 
on reductions of between 25 and 35 percent in import quotas of 
Chinese textiles. 
  According to him, the United States has withdrawn articles 
of 
arbitrary deduction regarding illegal transshipment of textiles 
from the proposed new agreement. 
  Shi said that the Chinese side also made substantial 
concessions during the talks. 
  China has agreed to accept a quota reduction of no more than 
three times the amount of textiles conclusively proven to have 
been illegally transshipped. 
  Besides, China also agreed to major adjustments of some 
categories of the textile quota proposed by the U.S. side. 
  The new agreement is the fourth of its kind China and the 
United States have reached. 
  Shi and U.S. top textile negotiator Jennifer Hillman signed 
the new document on behalf of their respective governments. 
  He attributed the success of the talks to the fact that, 
during the talks, both sides took into consideration the overall 
interests of bilateral trade and economic ties and adhered to 
the principle of equality, consultation and mutual understanding 
and accommodation. 
  He said he believed that signing the new agreement will be 
conducive to a healthy development of textile trade as well as 
other economic and trade ties between the two countries. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, met with Hillman and her delegation before 
attending the signing ceremony. 
  The previous textile trade agreement expired at the end of 
last year and the first round of talks on the new agreement 
started last September in Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- The new Sino-U.S. 
textile agreement will create favourable conditions for the up- 
coming China visit by the U.S. secretary of the Treasury and the 
scheduled meeting between the Chinese and U.S. foreign ministers 
in Paris. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, made this remark when meeting here this afternoon 
with chief U.S. negotiator Jennifer Hillman, who is here 
attending the fourth round negotiations on bilateral textile 
trade. 
  The negotiation ended here this afternoon with a new 
agreement on the Sino-U.S. textile trade being reached. 
  "The agreement has been reached through the joint efforts of 
both sides and both sides have adhered to the principles of 
consultation and equality during the talks," Wu said. 
  She said that U.S. capital, technology and equipment are 
conducive to China's modernization drive, as China's potentially 
huge market and abundant source of labour are important to the 
United States. 
  China and the United States are economically complementary 
and China attaches great importance to developing cooperation 
with the United States in all areas, she said. 
  Nevertheless, the minister said, various problems and 
difficulties may arise in future cooperation between the two 
sides. But the best way to address these problems is through 
dialogue and consultation on an equal footing, as has been 
proved by years of practice. 
  Any attempt to exert pressure by one side on the other can 
only lead to a trade war between them, she said. 
  China and the United States share common interests in 
dealing 
with illegal trans-shipment of textiles, Wu said, and added that 
she hoped both sides would make joint efforts to address the 
issue so as to ensure a smooth implementation of the memorandum 
of understanding on the bilateral textile agreement. 
  Hillman told Wu that the just concluded negotiations were 
productive, cooperative and mutually satisfactory. 
  China is the largest exporter of textiles to the United 
States, Hillman noted, and the agreement will provide for 
consistent and orderly growth of China's textile and textile 
product exports to the United States. 
  The U.S. chief negotiator also said that the new agreement 
will provide strong tools to ensure that the trans-shipment 
problem is tackled forcefully.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 17 KYODO -- U.S. and Chinese 
negotiators agreed to up to 13 percent cuts in textile imports 
to the United States in a last-ditch effort to avoid a trade war 
which could have gravely effected all levels of bilateral 
relations. 
  "This agreement does provide over the life of three years, 
an 
overall reduction from what the 1993 agreement had been of 
approximately 700 million dollars," chief U.S. textile 
negotiator Jennifer Hillman told KYODO NEWS SERVICE after the 
signing of the agreement. 
  This represents, "a 13 percent reduction over the time of 
the 
agreement from what the levels had been in 1993," she said. 
  "The agreement is the product of the joint effort made by 
both sides, both sides have started from the principles of 
consultation and equality," Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu Yi said before the signing 
ceremony. 
  According to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, China 
exported 7.3 billion dollars of textiles to the U.S. in 1993 
and was in jeopardy of facing 25-35 percent reductions in import 
quotas if the agreement was not reached. 
  Such reductions, which would have cost China up to 1.2 
billion dollars, were the result of alleged illegal textile 
transshipments to the U.S. which circumvented 1993's existing 
quota by some 2 billion dollars, Kantor said. 
  "Overall we reached an agreement that did include the 
language we had been seeking regarding what action we could take 
when we find repeated instances of transshipment," Hillman said. 
  "The language would permit us to make a deduction of up to 
three times the actual amount of goods shipped. If China is a 
repeat offender in terms of transshipment, we felt that it was 
very important to have strong measures to address the problem of 
transshipment," she said. 
  According to the present agreement, if in 1994 the U.S. can 
prove China is guilty of illegal transshipments worth 2 billion 
dollars, which the U.S. alleges took place in 1993, then they 
could effectively reduce China's import quota by up to 6 billion 
dollars. 
  A high-level MOFTEC official who participated in the talks 
felt there was "too much pressure" in the talks, saying, "the 
Chinese-side gave in too much." 
  The agreement, however, bodes well for the upcoming visit 
Wednesday of U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen to 
Beijing, the highest level visit by a U.S. official since the 
1989 crackdown on Tiananmen prodemocracy demonstrations, which 
soured relations between the two countries. 
  In June, China also faces the loss of its 
most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status, with the U.S. demanding "significant 
overall progress" in human rights, before it can renew MFN.

(1203 6511); Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1618 
GMT on 17 January transmits a service message correcting the 
following item; differences between the two versions are noted 
below] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (XINHUA) -- Representatives of the 
Chinese and U.S. Governments concluded and reached agreement on 
the fourth round of negotiations on bilateral textile trade 
talks. 
  Shi Guangsheng, Chinese vice minister of foreign trade and 
economic relations, and Ambassador Jennifer Hillman, U.S. Trade 
Representative Office chief negotiator for textile talks, signed 
a memorandum of understanding on a bilateral textile trade 
agreement on behalf of their respective governments. 
  Shi Guangsheng told reporters at the conclusion of the 
negotiations that [corrected version reads: ...According to a 
briefing.... (rewording)], both China and the United States made 
concessions during the latest round of negotiations. The U.S. 
side has agreed not to insist on reductions of between 25 and 35 
percent in import quotas of Chinese textiles; it has also 
withdrawn articles of arbitrary deduction regarding illegal 
transshipment of textiles. The Chinese side also made 
substantial concessions during the talks. China has agreed to 
accept a quota reduction of no more than three times the amount 
of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally 
transshipped by Chinese traders. Furthermore, China also agreed 
to major adjustments of some categories of the textile quota 
proposed by the U.S. side. 
  The third Chinese-U.S. textile agreement expired on 31 
December 1993. To negotiate and sign the fourth agreement, 
China and the United States conducted three rounds of talks 
without success from September to December last year. 
  Shi Guangsheng said [corrected version reads: ...It is 
understood.... (rewording)] that during the fourth round of 
talks, both sides took into consideration the overall interests 
of bilateral trade and economic ties, and adhered to the 
principle of equality, consultation and mutual understanding, 
and accommodation, thereby reaching agreement on textile 
arrangements -- an issue of great concern for both sides. The 
signing of the new agreement will be conducive to the healthy 
development of textile trade as well as other economic and trade 
ties between the two countries. 
  Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, 
witnessed the signing ceremony and met with the U.S. delegation 
led by Ambassador Hillman. She said: China attaches great 
importance to developing cooperation with the United States in 
economic, trade, and other areas. The United States has 
capital, technology, and equipment, which are conducive to 
China's modernization drive, while China has a huge market and 
abundant source of labor. The two countries are economically 
complementary. 
  Wu Yi said: Various problems, difficulties, and 
contradictions may arise in the course of cooperation between 
the two sides. However, it has been proved by years of practice 
that the best way to address these problems is through dialogue 
and consultation on an equal footing. Any attempt to exert 
pressure by one side on the other will be futile and can only 
lead to a trade war, which we do not want to see happen. 
  Wu Yi said: China and the United States share an identical 
view and common interests in cracking down on illegal 
transshipment of textiles. It is hoped that both sides will 
further cooperate and take measures to ensure a smooth 
implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the 
bilateral textile agreement. 
  Hillman said the Sino-U.S. negotiations were productive, 
cooperative, and mutually satisfactory. She added that China is 
the largest exporter of textiles to the United States, and the 
just concluded agreement is "extremely important" for developing 
economic and trade relations between the two countries.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch": "Chinese Official Reveals That Both China and </F>
United States Have Made Substantive Concessions, and Will 
Cooperate To Crack Down on Illegal Transshipment of Textiles"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Both sides have made 
substantive concessions to make possible the fourth Sino-U.S. 
textile agreement, which was reached today. China agreed to 
allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to investigate suspected 
factories under certain conditions and to adjustments for 
natural growth in some principal textile quotas proposed by the 
Americans, while the U.S. side agreed not to impose the quota 
reductions from 25 to 35 percent and not to send a fact-finding 
mission. 
  An official of the China Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation said: Since the third Sino-U.S. textile 
agreement expired on 31 December 1993, the two sides began talks 
in September last year on renewal of the bilateral agreement. 
But the two sides failed to reach agreement in the previous 
three rounds of talks, so a fourth round was held in the last 
three days. Under the principle of consultation on the basis of 
equality and mutual understanding and accommodation, the two 
sides made concerted efforts and finally reached a new agreement. 
  He pointed out: To reach agreement the two sides have made 
concessions. China made concessions as follows: 1) China 
agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to accompany 
Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile factories on 
the mainland suspected of engaging in illegal transshipment of 
textiles, given approval of the Chinese side and the factories 
concerned; 2) China agreed to major adjustments of the annual 
natural growth in some principal categories of the textile quota 
proposed by the U.S. side; and 3) if it is amply proven that 
individual Chinese enterprises have engaged in illegal 
transshipment and have done so once and again, China agreed to 
accept some quota reduction but no more than three times the 
amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally 
transshipped. While the Americans agreed: 1) Not to imposed 
the quota reductions from 25 to 35 percent demanded earlier; and 
2) not to apply the anti-corruption random clauses [fan wu bi di 
sui yi xing tiao kuan 0646 5294 1705 4104 7151 1942 1840 2742 
2949], which allow the U.S. authorities to send special 
fact-finding missions to China to investigate enterprises 
suspected of violating the agreement. 
  The official added: Apart from the foregoing, the two sides 
also made corresponding concessions on a number of important 
issues. The concrete contents of the agreement and of the 
concessions will not be published until later. 
  He continued: The key problem of the current negotiation 
concerned the investigation of and cracking down on illegal 
transshipments. Illegal transshipment refers to the practice of 
some illegal businessmen, who transshipped textiles to the 
United States by taking advantage of the balance quota of third 
countries to avoid quota controls exercised by importing and 
exporting countries. Such illegal transshipments only helped 
those "intermediaries" and illegal businessmen to make a 
windfall but damaged the interests of both countries. 
  He further pointed out: The illegal transshipment 
jeopardized the normal order of textile trade between the two 
countries and also led to chaos in the market. Therefore 
measures must be taken to ban and crack down on the illegal 
activities. As exporters in China, importers in the United 
States, and middlemen in third countries were involved in the 
illegal transshipment, which made the situation very 
complicated, the two countries must join force to effectively 
stamp out the illegal activities. The two countries have common 
positions, interests, and objectives on this matter. 
  Regarding China's measures against illegal transshipment, 
the 
official said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation has formulated many laws and regulations and begun 
to investigate relevant illegal activities in light of the 
information collected by itself and supplied by the Americans. 
In the last two years, China's relevant departments have taken 
action against 17 enterprises and a foreign office in China. 
China will reduce the quota of enterprises found guilty, revoke 
their right of export, ban them from serving as middlemen, and 
even withdraw their licenses. In the meantime, China will take 
legal action against those people engaged in the illegal 
activities. In the future, China will try to enforce relevant 
laws in a more effective way and intensify cooperation with the 
United States including exchange of information and joint 
investigations.

"Pragmatic U.S. Diplomacy and Its Relations With China"] 
  [Text] In the past several months, Sino-U.S. relations 
have attracted people's attention again. Both sides disagreed 
with each other on the textile trade issue; U.S. officials 
brought up an old case, saying that the Chinese side had made 
"little improvement" on the human rights issue, which may affect 
the extension of most-favored-nation [MFN] status in June; and 
Secretary of State Christopher will meet PRC Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen in Paris in late January to discuss bilateral 
relations. What is the development trend for Sino-U.S. 
relations this year? As the Clinton administration has 
reshuffled its leading group in foreign affairs and laid down 
its diplomatic foci, how will Sino-U.S. relations be affected? 
<H5>  Clinton To Strengthen His Diplomatic Work </H5>
  The Clinton administration, on the whole, did not have a 
good 
showing in its diplomatic work in 1993. It suffered a series of 
setbacks in Somalia and Haiti; the White House appeared to be 
very passive faced with the chaotic political situation in 
Russia; and it was criticized by the domestic media for its 
indecision on the Bosnian issue.... The first to announce his 
resignation was Defense Secretary Aspin, who is going to be 
succeeded by Inman. Then, Talbott, who is a good friend of the 
president and former director of the Washington office of TIME 
magazine, succeeded Walton as deputy secretary of state, thus 
becoming the No. 2 figure in the State Department. These 
personnel changes show that Clinton is going to strengthen his 
diplomatic work in 1994. 
  Clinton wants to straighten out the chaotic state of 
diplomatic work over the past year, hence, the diplomatic foci 
listed by the State Department are in the following order: 
Economic work and trade, the Middle East, Russia, nuclear 
proliferation, and the concept of democratic politics. Such a 
list is much more concrete than the three diplomatic principles 
(economic security, military security, and democratic security) 
set forth a year ago, which were ambiguous and contradictory in 
their implementation. Now, the Clinton administration's 
diplomatic policies are worked out in accordance with the medium 
to short-term interests of the United States, which, on the 
whole, conform to the traditional pattern of U.S. diplomatic 
strategy. People have noticed that democracy comes last in the 
list of diplomatic foci. 
  Last year, U.S. diplomacy was in a state of confusion. The 
Clinton administration just treated symptoms but not the disease 
and was led by the media. Moreover, it did not differentiate 
what was primary from what was secondary and its strategic 
interests were not clearly defined. For example, it stressed 
the "human rights issue" too much in its policy towards China 
and almost stopped granting MFN to China at the expense of its 
national economic interests. Although the recent White House 
reshuffle of its leading foreign affairs group does not have a 
direct bearing on Sino-U.S. relations (the move was mainly 
concerned with its policies towards East Europe and Russia), the 
orientation of these adjustments and the emphasis on real 
strategic interests will indirectly help advance Sino-U.S. 
relations to a normal path, that is, its policy towards China 
will be evaluated and considered in accordance with the real 
interests of the United States. 
<H5>  U.S. President Is Interested in China </H5>
  Over the last several months, many U.S. congressional 
delegations have visited China. Senator Johnston, chairman of 
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and 
Congressman Gephardt, majority leader of the House of 
Representatives, pointed out respectively that the United States 
should attach importance to the China market. They called for 
more economic cooperation and trade between the two countries 
and were generally satisfied with China's performance on the 
human rights issue. Regarding the State Department's assertion 
of so-called "little improvement" by China on the human rights 
issue, which "may affect the extension of MFN treatment," some 
observers in Washington said that this was merely a counter for 
the Clinton administration to bargain with Beijing and a move to 
try to force Beijing to make concessions. Moreover, although 
the U.S. ambassador to China said that China had made "great 
improvements" in human rights, the State Department immediately 
said that "little improvement" had been made, because the latter 
thinks that as the decision on extending MFN treatment is made 
six months from now, it was a little too early to make such 
conclusive remarks on this issue. 
  Meanwhile, according to sources in Washington, Clinton, who 
is inexperienced in diplomacy, is very much interested in China 
and frequently asks his assistants to regularly brief him on 
questions related to China. As far as Sino-U.S. trade relations 
are concerned, he is particularly optimistic. According to 
sources in the White House, the President believes that Beijing 
can persuade Pyongyang to take a mild gesture to solve the 
problem related to the DPRK's possible possession of nuclear 
weapons. The sources also said that Clinton had asked at least 
one of his assistants to try to reach a deeper understanding 
with President Jiang Zemin, and he also said he would personally 
handle policy on China in such a way as to treat Sino-U.S. 
relations as his own "special program," just as former President 
Bush did. 
<H5>  The United States Is Not Politically Superior to China </H5>
  Diplomatic observers on Washington said: Viewed from the 
framework of international relations in the mid-1990's, the 
United States does not have the means to blockade China, and the 
day when Beijing and Washington are on an equal footing is about 
to come or has already come. People notice that such western 
powers as Germany, Japan, and France have vigorously developed 
trade relations with China and are looking forward to entering 
the huge China market. However, as far as the international 
political situation is concerned, the development of the 
political situation in Russia is really a very great worry to 
the United States and the Clinton administration, and the U.S. 
public are anxious about the changes there over the past six 
months. Under such international circumstances, Washington is 
not ready to antagonize China in the diplomatic arena. Hence, a 
Chinese scholar said: Compared with Washington, Beijing now has 
greater superiority in the international political arena. Facts 
have proved that the means employed by the United States against 
China, such as siege, intimidation, and discrediting China, have 
been ineffective. In 1994, for the sake of the United States' 
own interests, the Clinton administration cannot but reciprocate 
toward China, and such a situation is quite evident.

Repatriated From the United States to Xiamen Today"] 
  [Text] Xiamen, 17 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--U.S. immigration 
authorities will repatriate a group of Chinese illegal 
immigrants to China directly from Los Angeles by plane tomorrow 
(18 January); it is expected that the plane will land at 
Xiamen's Gaoqi International Airport at about 1400. 
  A relevant person disclosed here that about 123 Chinese 
illegal immigrants will be repatriated, among them most are 
peasants from Fujian Province's Fuzhou City and Changle County, 
and one of them may be a Cantonese. 
  U.S. immigration authorities have hired a special plane this 
time and appointed three officials to escort the illegal 
immigrants to China to handle repatriation formalities. There 
will also be 130 security personnel on board the plane. 
  Last year, the U.S. side repatriated a group of Chinese 
illegal immigrants, and the destination was Xiamen. However, 
unlike the repatriation last time, the plane will fly directly 
to China after taking off from the United States, without making 
a detour. 
  Originally, the repatriation work had been scheduled for 15 
January, but was changed to 18 January for some reason. This 
afternoon, the relevant authorities of Fujian Province and 
Xiamen city convened a meeting again to make arrangements for 
the concrete matters of repatriation and reception tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- The Japanese 
Government today provided China with a loan totaling 40 billion 
yen as a compensation for its tremendous trade surplus over 
China. 
  The contract was signed in Tokyo today by the Bank of China 
(BOC) and the Import and Export Bank of Japan. 
  According to BOC officials, this is the second Japanese 
Government loan to China made specially to make up for the trade 
imbalance between the two countries. 
  The first, made in 1987, totaled 30 billion Japanese yen. 
  BOC officials said that the loan would be used to accelerate 
the construction of industrial projects in south China's Hainan 
Province and in Qingdao of east China's Shandong Province. 
  Japan has been at the top of the list of China's trade 
partners. In 1993, its trade surplus over China was close to 7.5 
billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- China will continue

  The delegation from the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by First 
Prime Minister Samdech Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen, arrived here yesterday on an official visit. 
  Ranariddh thanked China for its aid to Cambodia, on behalf 
of 
the Cambodian Government. 
  Jiang said the visit by the two prime ministers showed that 
the Cambodian Government pays much attention to its friendly and 
cooperative relations with China. 
  The visit, a great event in bilateral relations, will 
promote 
mutual understanding and friendship, Jiang said. 
  Ranariddh said his delegation held fruitful talks with 
Premier Li Peng yesterday, and hoped that the visit would 
further consolidate and improve Sino-Cambodian relations. 
  Jiang said that Cambodia's transition from a 20-year-long 
war 
to a period of peaceful reconstruction brought light to the 
Cambodian people's common will and was also in line with the 
major trend of peace and development in the region. 
  Jiang said the Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the 
Cambodian Government will cherish the hard-won peace, further 
advance the process of national reconciliation and mobilize all 
the Cambodian people to build up their country. 
  Ranariddh said that though facing difficulties, the 
Cambodians are optimistic about their future. 
  Under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk, they will 
build Cambodia into a country of independence, sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and prosperity, Ranariddh added. 
  Jiang described King Sihanouk as the beloved leader of the 
Cambodian people and respected friend of the Chinese people, 
adding that he had made indelible contributions to Cambodia's 
independence. 
  Earlier today, the Cambodian guests laid a wreath at the 
Monument to the People's Heroes and paid their respects to the 
remains of Chairman Mao Zedong. They also inspected two 
factories in Beijing. 
  They are scheduled to visit the Hainan island province in

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng held talks with Cambodia's First Prime Minister Norodom 
Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen here this afternoon. 
  They exchanged views on bilateral relations and on regional 
and international issues. 
  Ranariddh and Hun Sen, leading a government delegation from 
the Kingdom of Cambodia, arrived here this afternoon on a 
five-day official visit to China as Li's guests. 
  During the talks, Premier Li welcomed them on their first

relations, adding that it is significant to further such 
relations under the new situation.

Government to develop and strengthen bilateral traditional 
friendship and restore cooperation in various fields on the

  Ranariddh said that the Cambodian people and Government have 
always regarded China as a sincere and great friend, and will 
never forget the important contributions that China made to 
Cambodia's peace process. 
  At present, Ranariddh said, his country is at a crucial

of restoration and reconstruction, and the Cambodian Government 
wants its friendly cooperation in all fields with China to be 
enhanced through the current visit, on the basis of mutual 
benefits and equality. 
  Ranariddh expressed his thanks to the Chinese Government and

Norodom Sihanouk. 
  Touching on Cambodia's domestic situation, Premier Li said

irreplaceable role in this, he added. 
  Li Peng said that the Chinese Government and people 
sincerely 
hope that Cambodia will become a neutral and non-aligned country. 
  China appreciates Cambodia's efforts towards a proper 
handling of relations with its neighbor nations, Li said, adding 
that the more friends that Cambodia makes, the better. 
  The Chinese premier said it is necessary to have a peaceful 
neighborly environment for Cambodia's reconstruction and 
development, and that China hopes that the Cambodian Government, 
under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk and in the spirit 
of national reconciliation, will solve its internal problems 
properly to maintain peace and stability in Cambodia for the 
country's reconstruction. 
  Ranariddh said the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by King 
Sihanouk, 
is working for unity and reconciliation, and all parties in the 
Cambodian Government and Parliament can cooperate with each 
other closely. 
  There are sound grounds for Cambodia's national 
reconciliation and its economy will certainly be restored and 
rebuilt with the help of the international community. 
  During the talks, the Chinese premier briefed the guests on 
China's economic construction and its reforms and opening up. 
  The two sides also exchanged views briefly on regional and 
international issues of common interest. 
  Ranariddh invited Premier Li Peng to visit Cambodia at his 
convenience. Li expressed thanks and accepted the invitation. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was among those who took 
part 
in the talks. 
  Meanwhile, Zhu Lin, Premier Li Peng's wife, met with Madame

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Shanghai] </F>
  [Text] China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, is 
preparing to make his traditional televised appearance to convey 
New Year's greetings to the people of Shanghai next month, 
according to sources in the eastern metropolis. 
  Mr Deng, 89, is expected to make a short speech before a 
specially invited audience of Shanghai government and Communist 
Party leaders on Lunar New Year's Eve, February 9. 
  According to sources in the municipal Government, the 
patriarch's speech will focus on the need for government 
officials to "further liberate their thinking" and "overcome the 
fear of making mistakes". 
  Such "thought liberation" is necessary if Shanghai is to 
maintain its spectacular development of the past three years and 
regain its place as financial and commercial capital of the Asia 
Pacific region, Mr Deng is expected to say. 
  In his meetings with Shanghai Party secretary Wu Bangguo and 
Mayor Huang Ju at the secluded Xijiao State Guesthouse during 
the past few weeks, Mr Deng is said to have expressed 
satisfaction with the pace of economic reform and development in 
Shanghai in the past year. 
  But he voiced concern that some cadres were still being too 
hesitant, sources said. 
  "Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that some cadres are still 
worrying about whether reforms are capitalist or socialist and 
that they should liberate their thinking on this point," one 
well placed source said. 
  "He said it doesn't matter if you make mistakes because 
mistakes can be rectified," the source said. 
  The patriarch's planned New Year's Eve address will probably 
be his only formal public appearance in Shanghai this winter. 
  Apart from a short visit with his daughter and private 
secretary Deng Rong to the newly-completed Yangpu suspension 
bridge linking northern Shanghai with Pudong and a trip to the 
top of the Jinjiang Tower Hotel, Mr Deng has not made any 
sightseeing excursions since arriving in Shanghai in December. 
  The patriarch, who is said to be in poor health, spends most 
of his time resting at the Xijiao State Guesthouse in the west 
of the city. 
  His only regular outing is to the Huadong Hospital to 
receive 
medical treatment, sources said. 
  He is said to visit the hospital every morning at 10.30 for 
a 
massage and acupuncture treatment before returning to his 
guesthouse. 
  Mr Deng and his entourage travel between the hospital and 
the 
guesthouse in an unmarked minivan.

<F P=106> [By special staff correspondent Hou Chung-wen (0186 0112 </F>
2429): "Central Propaganda Department Tightens Controls Over 
Press; Guangdong Reorganizes Five Newspapers and Four Magazines"] 
  [Text] The CPC Central Propaganda Department called a work 
conference a few days ago in Nanning, Guangxi on rectifying 
newspapers and magazines, which demanded that localities rectify 
newspapers' weekend editions and leisure publications and 
tighten controls over reports in this area. 
  In line with the Central Propaganda Department conference, 
from the end of 1993 onward, localities have been rectifying 
local newspapers and magazines. In Guangdong, where the 
cultural market is relatively active, authorities in charge of 
ideological matters recently launched a large-scale 
rectification of newspapers and magazines within the province. 
So far, four magazines, five newspapers, and three major 
provincial publishing houses have been punished to various 
degrees. Such a situation and trend is rarely seen in Guangdong 
news and publishing sectors. 
  It is understood that this rectification movement is not 
targeting the "sleazy" tabloids, but almost without exception 
respectable newspapers which are quite influential in the 
province and country, apart from some newly founded newspapers. 
That receiving the "capital sentence" -- having its operating 
license revoked -- was LUCHAO [Travel Tide], a monthly devoted 
to tourism published by the Guangdong Travel Publishing House 
run under the Guangdong Provincial Travel Bureau. The story is 
that the provincial department in charge held that some articles 
run by the monthly were guilty of propagating "sex culture" and 
"encouraging pre-marital cohabitation." The magazine has been 
disbanded and all the editorial and news staff had jobs arranged 
by the tourism bureau. 
  XIWANG [HOPE], a cultural monthly published by the Guangdong 
Provincial People's Publishing House, was "suspended for two 
issues for rectification." Another publication touted as a 
Sino-foreign joint venture, XIANDAI HUABAO [MODERN PICTURES], 
was ordered to "spell out the origin of its foreign capital" and 
was accused of "becoming the mainland counterpart of NEXT 
MAGAZINE [a general interest and lifestyle magazine which has 
voiced support for democracy in China] of Hong Kong." Cultural 
monthly WENHUA GUANGCHANG [CULTURE SQUARE], published and run by 
the Huacheng publishing house of Guangdong has been suspended 
for rectification for allegedly "preaching bourgeois 
liberalization views." 
  As for newspapers, DONGFANG YEBAO [ORIENTAL EVENING POST], 
run by the Guangzhou City Cultural Bureau and XING BAO [THE 
STAR] run by the Guangdong Provincial Writers' Association, 
though both newly established, were born at the wrong time and 
were punished with "continuing to publish while rectification is 
going on," with the reason that they "exceeded the scope set by 
their application and approval," with the former being further 
accused of "failing to build the character of an evening post." 
  NANFANG ZHOUMO [SOUTHERN WEEKEND], under NANFANG RIBAO -- 
the 
mouthpiece for the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, caught 
the wrath of the Public Security Ministry last July with a 
"highly inaccurate article," but was saved from suspension under 
the protection of Xie Fei, Guangdong CPC secretary and CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau member, although they were 
ordered to write an "in-depth" criticism by the Guangdong 
authorities. The two criticisms have been circulated to all the 
province's news and publishing units and cadres at or above 
section head rank and departments by the Guangdong Provincial 
Propaganda Department in the form of official documents to serve 
as an example. 
  YUEGANG XINXI RIBAO [GUANGDONG AND HONG KONG INFORMATION 
DAILY], which is jointly run by YANGCHENG WANBAO, the Guangdong 
Provincial Economic Committee, and the Yuehai Group Company, has 
recently been accused of being the source of the recent crazy 
rises in grain prices for running articles analyzing grain price 
movements on the mainland. Its chief editor and assistant were 
summoned to the provincial propaganda department to be lectured. 
They were criticized for the reports and ordered to "toe the 
party line and not speak in a middle position." 
  The noteworthy thing is that both LUCHAO and XING BAO were 
punished for the same crime of "running articles favoring second 
births" and "opposing family planning." 
  News reforms in recent years in China have resulted in 
newspapers expanding pages and editions to increase their 
readability and entertainment value. But from the second half 
of 1993, the Central Propaganda Department has repeatedly sent 
out a signal of rectification, pointing out that newspapers were 
printing words about sex culture and high consumption and had 
been targeted by officials in charge of ideological matters. 
Meanwhile, some economic newspapers have also been accused of 
misleading readers for reporting economic problems closely 
related to the people's livelihood. 
  Therefore, many of those in charge of these newspapers and 
magazines are at a loss and are carefully and cautiously 
shelving development plans for 1994 and adopting a "defensive" 
strategy.

"Central Authorities Plan To Solve Problems of Rapid 
Development in Two to Three Years"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--According to an 
authoritative source here, the top central leadership recently 
pointed out that the money supply and the size of capital 
construction will continue to increase and go beyond the 
economy's endurance in 1994. The central authorities have thus 
decided to resolve problems occurring with rapid development in 
two to three years. 
  The source quoted a top leader saying that the economic 
macrocontrol measures adopted in 1993 had not thoroughly 
resolved the problems brought about by high-speed economic 
growth since 1992. Because a "hard landing" [ying zhuo lu 4289 
4192 7120] was effected in 1993, this led to serious ups and 
downs in the economy and caused certain shocks to society. 
Therefore, those measures for intensifying economic 
macrocontrol in 1993 could only be effective to a limited 
degree. That is, they succeeded in curbing the rising 
inflation rate and restraining the scale of capital construction 
as banks were prevented from offering large amounts of capital 
in the market. 
  The leader said that according to estimates, the scale of 
construction in progress throughout the country is three times 
that of 1991. In order to complete all the construction 
projects that have been started, it is not enough to just issue 
more currency. The increase in the money supply will just result 
in a substantial increase in prices. Therefore, it is necessary 
to effect an economic "soft landing" in 1994. The money supply 
and the scale of capital construction must not be increased 
substantially. Otherwise, the authorities will be forced to 
effect another round of "hard landing" and to exercise strict 
control by mandatory administrative means. It is hard to 
imagine what changes would then be brought about in society. 
For example, steel and cement prices are still increasing at 
present. In 1993, when macrocontrol was being exercised, steel 
prices were lowered somewhat, but are now increasing again. The 
price of cement has never been lowered. In such circumstances, 
it is impossible to enlarge the size of capital construction any 
further. 
  He finally emphasized that the central authorities attach 
great importance to reforms in 1994. If the reforms do not go 
smoothly, China will lose an important historical opportunity, 
and it will be hard to find another similar opportunity in the 
future. At present, China is facing a very good domestic and 
international situation. Therefore, the 1994 reforms must 
succeed, thus fundamentally guaranteeing the sustained, rapid, 
and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 
1660] development of the national economy. If the reforms do 
not succeed, the size of capital construction continues to grow, 
and prices continue to increase, social unrest may occur and 
China may lose the opportunity.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Grain, Oil Prices in Some Areas </F>
Stabilized"] 
  [Text] The surge in the prices of grain and edible oil in 
several provinces has been curbed by the intercession of 
governments at all levels. 
  The central government provided 2.5 million tons of grain 
and 
32,000 tons of edible oil from State reserves to ease the 
shortages in some provinces and cities, according to official 
sources. 
  The local governments in Shaanxi, Shandong and Anhui 
provinces and Beijing also supplied more grain and oil to 
satisfy demand. 
  Administrative measures were also applied by local 
authorities to stabilize grain prices. 
  The Beijing municipal government imposed price ceilings on 
27 
staples, including rice, flour, edible oil and pork. 
  Changzhou, in Jiangsu Province, set price guidelines for 
grain and oil. 
  Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province in the northeast, 
is strengthening the monitoring of market prices and restricting 
the margin between wholesale and retail prices. The local 
government is also preparing to establish a price regulatory 
fund to limit price fluctuations on the market. 
  Experts believe local governments must adopt administrative 
methods to keep prices from climbing further. 
  However, they said the most effective means of intervening 
in 
the market are economic, including setting up regulatory funds 
and perfecting the grain reserve systems. 
  The key factors in keeping prices stable are raising grain 
output and reforming the grain purchase and selling systems, 
they said. 
  Since last November, the prices of grain, rice, edible oil, 
pork and eggs have risen sharply around the country. 
  In coastal provinces and large cities, prices have 
skyrocketed by 30 to 40 percent. 
  According to statistics from major cities, the price of a 
kilogram of high-quality rice soared by 1.1 yuan (12.6 cents) to 
2 yuan (22.9 cents). 
  Prices of flour and noodles and other rice products 
subsequently increased by 0.4 yuan (46 cents) [figure as 
published] to 0.6 yuan (69 cents) [figure as published] per 
kilogram. 
  In large and medium-sized cities of Liaoning Province, the 
price of pork jumped by 20 to 50 percent. In Henan Province the 
pork price rose last month from 7.35 yuan ($0.84) per kilogram 
to 8.25 yuan ($0.95). 
  Experts attributed the increases to anticipation of 
continued 
inflation, delays in deliveries caused by the persistent 
transportation bottleneck, and psychological and speculative 
factors. 
  Through the joint efforts of central and local governments, 
the prices of grain and edible oil have been brought under 
control. 
  For example, Jiangsu Province fixed the prices for grain and 
cooking oil and secured an adequate supply for the market. 
  Just before the new year, more than 10 million kilograms of 
rice and flour and 2.5 million kilograms of cooking oil were 
released onto the market in Nanjing, the provincial capital.

  [Text] Some foreign companies are having to wait to convert 
yuan directly into hard currency at banks, even though they are 
now legally bound to accept payment in the Chinese currency. 
But they believe banking authorities will permit conversion 
once the dust has settled on the yuan exchange-rate reforms. 
  From January 1, all foreign companies were required to open 
yuan accounts with their banks for payments received in local 
currency. But remittances in hard currencies from yuan accounts 
will have to wait until the banking authorities have worked out 
the regulations. 
  This follows the decision to unify the two-tier currency 
system by adopting a single managed-float exchange rate of about 
8.7 yuan to the U.S. dollar, close to what was previously 
available in swap centres. Previously, the other rate used was 
the official rate of 5.8 yuan to the dollar. 
  Several foreign airlines have reported that conversion into 
foreign currencies from these accounts has been frozen, whereas 
they do not encounter any problems with foreign exchange 
certificates (FECs), which are still freely converted into U.S. 
dollars at the old official rate of 5.8. British Airlines 
manager Charles Phelps-Penry said, "We are still able to remit 
FECs at the old rate of 5.8 to the dollar. But at the moment, 
they are not allowing yuan remittances because the Chinese 
authorities are still working out the regulations. We have been 
given to believe that this is a temporary situation, pending 
publication of final regulations." 
  Because FECs are being withdrawn gradually from circulation, 
they are converted immediately into U.S. dollars when companies 
deposit them into their bank accounts. FECs can also be 
switched into yuan, but they are first converted into U.S. 
dollars at the old exchange rate of 5.8 and then re-converted 
into yuan at the new rate of about 8.7. 
  Hans Hauri, China World Hotel's general manager, said that 
yuan payments through credit cards by his hotel guests could be 
converted directly into U.S. dollars. Conversion for cash 
payments in yuan was also allowed but was slightly more 
complicated. The chief representative of another airline said, 
"They are allowing deposits from credit-card sales in yuan to be 
remitted although it is a different matter for yuan cash 
deposits." He added that as long as the freeze was temporary, 
it would not pose a problem as the airline could use the bulk of 
the yuan earnings to finance its local expenses. 
  Hong Kong Bank's Beijing chief representative, Gordon Lam, 
said he expected the freeze in yuan remittances to be only 
temporally and that the Bank of China would clarify the 
situation once it had come to terms with the changes. 
  Many foreign investors who have been in China for the last 
three to five years hope that this problem can be resolved soon, 
as their operations are at a stage where they are beginning to 
produce profits to be repatriated. For them, the availability 
of foreign exchange is a source of concern, because they are 
competing with domestic enterprises and the Chinese for the 
limited hard currencies. 
  "Although you still have the swap market to go to and 
exchange yuan into foreign currency, how available is the 
foreign exchange -- especially to investors now in their third 
or fourth year of operation, where there is enough profit being 
generated for repatriation?" said Johnny Chen, treasurer of the 
American Chamber of Commerce. "There is not enough hard 
currency for investors as a whole," said Mr Chen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Farm Bank Affirms Its Loan Policy] </F>
  [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China, the country's 
leading bank for rural investment, will continue its policy of 
mandatory lending this year, its president said. 
  The bank president, Ma Yongwei, said last week at a national 
conference of bankers that the bank will control its lending 
according to the policies of the central bank, the People's Bank 
of China. 
  Ma said that this year the bank will continue its mandated 
lending to support the State's plan for developing rural 
industry and the fixed assets in the countryside. 
  In response to the growing demand for capital for the 
countryside, Ma said, the bank's arranged loans this year for 
various sectors in the rural economy are expected to surpass 
last year's. 
  But because a market economy requires the country's lending 
institutions to operate more commercially, the bank must also 
consider the risks in extending credit, Ma said. 
  In a firm response to the government's call for strongly 
backing agriculture, the bank intends this year to expand loans 
for crop production by 25 billion yuan ($2.87 billion) from last 
year, when it lent about 233 billion yuan ($26.78 billion). 
  Ma predicted that in 1994 inflation will exert greater 
pressure on farmers to cut production costs. If inflation 
remains at last year's level, he said, it will stimulate a 
rising spiral in agricultural prices as well as in the demand 
for bank loans. 
  In addition, Ma said the disparity between available capital 
and the demand for credit will widen this year as the 
Agricultural Bank must shoulder a heavier burden in buying State 
Treasury bonds and co-operated bonds.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "No Relief From Trade Imbalance"] </F>
  [Text] China is unlikely to shrug off a trade deficit this 
year, although the scale could be trimmed, a senior government 
economist said last week. 
  "It will be an uphill battle for China to yield a balanced 
foreign trade, unless the government hits upon extraordinary 
ideas," said Wang Huaian, an economist with the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. 
  China posted a trade deficit of $12.2 billion last year, the 
first since 1989. 
  Wang said positive factors to boost the country's exports 
this year will be undercut by negative ones. 
  Sustained economic growth, exports of more high-value-added 
goods, and a uniform foreign exchange rate for renminbi yuan, as 
well as the establishment of more Sino-foreign joint ventures, 
all help to keep exports buoyant. 
  "But inflation and money shortages are still biting and 
pushing up export costs," Wang pointed out. 
  Analysts believe an upward price spiral is possible this 
year, although the government has pledged to stabilize or even 
lower prices before China's Lunar New Year, which falls early 
next month. 
  And despite the central government's imposition of a 
credit-tightening policy last July, Wang said a brisk domestic 
market will revive and squeeze exports. 
  "The convergence of renminbi foreign exchange rates is a 
coin 
of two sides," he said, suggesting that the move could hardly 
yield a much-needed boost to exports. 
  "This is because most Chinese enterprises, including 
foreign-funded ones, had already done the bulk of their exports 
according to the swap market rate, which is close to the current 
uniform one of $1 to 8.7 yuan," he explained. 
  Similarly, China should not be under the delusion that 
higher 
import costs resulting from the unification could sharply reduce 
imports. 
  A considerable part of China's trade in hard currency had 
been carried out at the swap market rate before the uniform one 
took effect on January 1. 
  "In short, the positive effect of the single-rate system, 
which formally devalues the yuan, has been watered down," Wang 
said. 
  In the meantime, Wang expects China to maintain high growth 
this year even though the government has lowered its estimate of 
expansion to 8 percent to 9 percent, compared with the 13.2 
percent of last year. 
  "It would be good enough if China caps the growth rate for 
1994 under 10 percent," he said. 
  Even with 10 percent, China's economy will grow more rapidly 
than most of other nations and regions. 
  Hence the sustained high demand for imports, at least for 
state key projects designed to improve infrastructure. 
  "As a developing nation, China can hardly cut all these 
imports and totally rely on its own resources," Wang said. 
  "China will face a tougher economic scenario if it chops 
imports abruptly." 
  This is especially true as China moves toward rejoining the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 
  "We have to open our markets wider for foreign products 
after 
our re-entry into Gatt, which demands free and fair trade," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Central Bank's New Reforms of </F>
Foreign Exchange System"] 
  [Text] In order to promote the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure in China and further open it up to the 
outside world so as to develop the national economy in a more 
sustained, rapid, and healthy fashion, the People's Bank of 
China makes the following announcement pursuant to the decision 
of the State Council on further reforms of China's foreign 
exchange management system as of January 1, 1994. 
<H3>  I. To Implement the System of Selling Off Foreign Exchange 
Receipts to the Banks and Abolish Foreign Exchange Retention 
System </H3>
  The foreign exchange receipts of all domestic enterprises, 
public institutions, government agencies, and social 
organizations in China shall be promptly repatriated. Foreign 
exchange earnings which fall into the following categories 
(except those of foreign investment enterprises) shall all be 
sold off to the designated foreign exchange banks for renminbi 
based on the exchange rates listed by the banks. 
  1. Foreign exchange earnings from exports, transit trade and 
other trading activities; 
  2. Foreign exchange earnings from services provided by 
communication and transportation, post and telecommunications, 
tourism, insurance, and other service industries, and from 
inter-governmental transfer; 
  3. Net foreign exchange proceeds from foreign exchange 
operations of the banks, which are required to be turned over to 
the State, and foreign exchange returns received from overseas 
service contracts, and from investment abroad which are subject 
to repatriation; and 
  4. Other foreign exchange receipts which are required to be 
sold off to banks pursuant to the regulations of the exchange 
control administration. 
  Foreign exchange earnings of the following categories are 
permitted to be held in foreign exchange in the accounts opened 
with the designated foreign exchange banks: 
  (1) Foreign exchange remittance to China for the purpose of 
investment by non-resident legal entities or natural persons; 
  (2) Foreign exchange received from external borrowing, and 
debt or equity issuance; 
  (3) Funds remitted back to China by the service contracts 
companies within the contract period of their overseas projects 
for current use of the project; 
  (4) Receipts from foreign donations and grants approved for 
specific purposes; 
  (5) Foreign exchange receipts of diplomatic missions, and 
residence offices of international organizations and other 
non-resident legal entities in China; and 
  (6) Foreign exchange held by individuals. 
  When payments for domestic expenses occur for the 
above-mentioned categories of foreign exchange, they should be 
made in renminbi, which can be exchanged at the designated 
foreign exchange banks. 
  All such existing foreign exchange allocation systems as 
foreign exchange retention, compulsory turning-over, and quota 
control are to be abolished. The current holding of foreign 
exchange retention quotas, and the outstanding balance of 
foreign exchange accounts, which is excluded from the 
above-mentioned categories permitted to be held in foreign 
exchange, will be dealt with in accordance with the following 
principles: 
  The holdings of foreign exchange retention quotas will 
continue to be valid and can be used based on the official 
renminbi exchange rate published on December 31, 1993. The 
foreign exchange retention quotas, which are sold off to the 
banks before the unification of the exchange rates but of which 
book entry is yet to be completed, shall be entered into the 
book before January 31, 1994, and are also permitted to use 
according to the official exchange rate published on December 
31,1993. 
  The above-mentioned outstanding balance of foreign exchange 
accounts, which is excluded from the categories permitted to be 
held in foreign exchange, may be maintained under the system of 
selling off all foreign exchange receipts to banks, but for such 
accounts, only withdrawal is permitted with no more re-deposit 
until all funds in the accounts are drawn off. The outstanding 
balance of these foreign exchange accounts can be used for 
current payments, debt service, and selling off to the banks. 
<H3>  II. To Implement the System of Purchasing Foreign Exchange 
From the Banks and Make the Renminbi Conditionally Convertible 
Under the Current Account </H3>
  After introducing the system of purchasing foreign exchange 
from the banks, the existing authorization procedure of 
allocating foreign exchange according to the State plan for 
normal external payment items under the current account is to be 
abolished. Foreign exchange needed by domestic enterprises, 
public institutions, government agencies, and social 
organizations for external payments under the current account 
shall be purchased from the designated foreign exchange banks 
with renminbi, upon presentation of the following effective 
documentation and then the banks make the payment for them. 
  1. Import quota, licence, or other import authorization 
issued by the departments concerned and relevant import contract 
for those items subject to import quota or import restrictions; 
  2. Registration verification and relevant import contract 
for those items subject to import voluntary registration; 
  3. Import contract and notification for payment from 
overseas financial institutions for all other import items than 
the above two categories, which are in conformity with the State 
regulations; and 
  4. Payment agreement or contract and notification for 
payment from overseas financial and non-financial institutions 
for commercial payment under the non-trade account. 
  Purchase of foreign exchange for non-commercial payments or 
for withdrawal of foreign currency in cash shall be proceeded in 
accordance with the relevant regulations on financial and 
foreign exchange control. The authorization procedures shall 
continue to be in effect for foreign exchange remittance for 
making overseas investment, lending, and donations. 
  As an interim measure the export enterprises, at the initial 
stage of this reform, can open a record-keeping account over the 
counter at the designated banks with 50 percent of the total 
foreign exchange they sell off to the banks. When they need 
foreign exchange for export operations and other supplementary 
trading expenses, upon presentation of valid documents as 
mentioned above, the banks will sell them the foreign exchange 
and make the payment directly if the transaction amount is not 
more than the outstanding entitlement as recorded in their 
record-keeping accounts. For the payment amount exceeding their 
entitlement, the enterprises may also purchase foreign exchange 
with renminbi and make the payment at the designated banks, but 
upon presenting valid documentation in accordance with the 
relevant State regulations. 
<H3>  III. To Establish an Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market and 
Improve the Mechanism of Exchange Rate Determination So As To 
Maintain a Reasonable and Relatively Stable Renminbi Exchange 
Rate </H3>
  After the introduction of the systems of selling and buying 
foreign exchange at the banks, a national unified inter-bank 
foreign exchange market will be established. The designated 
foreign exchange banks are main participants in the inter-bank 
market whose main functions are to facilitate the matching of 
long and short foreign exchange positions of different 
designated banks, and to provide clearing and settlement service 
for banks. This market is regulated and supervised by the 
People's Bank of China through the State Administration of 
Exchange Control. 
  The dual renminbi exchange rates are to be unified as of 
January 1, 1994. The unified renminbi exchange rate will become 
a single, managed floating rate based on market demand and 
supply of foreign exchange. The People's Bank of China will 
publish daily the middle rate of renminbi against US dollar 
according to the transaction price prevailing in the inter-bank 
foreign exchange market on the previous day, and also, with 
reference to the changes of the international foreign exchange 
market, publish the renminbi rates against other major foreign 
currencies. Based on the foreign exchange rates published by 
the People's Bank, the designated banks will then list their own 
exchange rates within the floating range designated by the 
People's Bank, and purchase or sell foreign exchange to their 
customers at the listed rates. With the prerequisite of 
stabilizing the domestic currency, the listed exchange rates of 
different banks are to be maintained basically compatible and 
relatively stable through inter-bank foreign exchange trading 
and the intervention of the People's Bank through buying and 
selling foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market. 
<H3>  IV. To Strengthen the Legitimate Operation and Service 
Function of the Designated Foreign Exchange Banks </H3>
  The source of renminbi funds needed by the designated banks 
to conduct foreign exchange trading shall be in principle from 
the banks' own capital. The State only implements a 
proportional control over the foreign exchange working funds 
held by the designated banks, the proportional ratios of each 
designated bank are to be determined by the People's Bank based 
on the size of its foreign exchange assets and total turnovers 
in foreign exchange settlement. If the foreign exchange working 
capital holdings of a designated bank exceed the ceiling of its 
designated ratio, it must sell the excess to other designated 
banks or the People's Bank, if its holdings drop to a level less 
than the low limit of the designated ratio, it must buy enough 
foreign exchange promptly from other designated banks or the 
People's Bank to supplement its holdings. 
  In order to allow their customers with forward payment 
contracts or debt repayment agreements to be protected from the 
exchange rate risk, the designated banks may conduct renminbi 
hedging business against foreign currencies for their customers 
when the valid documents are presented. 
  All designated banks shall maintain a rational assets and 
liabilities structure, and conduct such business activities as 
foreign exchange buying and selling, establishment of accounts, 
deposit-taking, and loan-making in accordance with the relevant 
regulations. The banks are expected to strive for high quality 
in customer service, low level of service charges, legitimacy in 
business conduct, and honesty in competition. 
<H3>  V. Reinforcing the External Debts Administration and 
Establishing a Debt Redemption Fund So As To Safeguard China's 
International Credibility </H3>
  China will continue its current practice of managing 
external 
borrowing and repayment by centralized planning, financial 
authorization, and debt registration. All guarantees issued for 
borrowing incurred by nonresident legal entities (including 
those overseas institutions and enterprises controlled by 
Chinese domestic capitals) shall be in rigorous pursuance to the 
Requirements of Providing Foreign Exchange Guaranty by Domestic 
Institutions which was promulgated by the State Administration 
of Exchange Control. 
  In order to maintain the international credibility of our 
country, the control over the repayment of external debts is to 
be reinforced so as to continue with the principle that 
repayment should be made by those who incur the debts. 
Borrowers are required to intensify the management of those 
projects financed by external debts in order to improve the 
economic efficiency and capability of foreign exchange earnings 
of the projects. The State encourages and supports those local 
authorities, departments concerned, and heavily indebted 
enterprises to establish redemption funds in proportion to their 
total debt outstanding. Such redemption funds are permitted to 
be deposited in the special foreign exchange accounts opened 
with designated foreign exchange banks. Foreign exchange 
receipts from designated exports specially authorized by the 
State and earmarked for debt repayments can be credited directly 
to the special accounts. Funds in such special accounts may 
only be used for external debt service, and are forbidden to be 
transferred or used for other payments. 
  The debt service payments shall be made from borrower's 
special accounts opened for redemption funds. If borrowers are 
inflicted with repayment difficulties, subject to review and 
authorization by the foreign exchange control administration, 
they may purchase foreign exchange with renminbi at the 
designated foreign exchange banks, upon presenting certificates 
of debt registration and debt service authorization in 
accordance with the borrowing agreement, so as to make the 
repayment. In the case that the borrowers intend to make the 
repayment prior to the maturity date as provided by in the 
borrowing agreements, such repayment is subject to the approval 
of the foreign exchange control administration according to the 
relevant regulations. No bank is permitted to make repayment 
transactions without proper authorization for those unregistered 
external obligations, or for those obligations incurred by 
unauthorized issuance of debt guarantees to non-resident legal 
entities by the domestic institutions. 
  As for those foreign exchange loans made by domestic 
financial institutions, repayments may be made by borrowers 
directly from their foreign exchange receipts, or with the 
foreign exchange that they purchase using renminbi at the 
designated banks pursuant to the loan agreements. Under the new 
system, loans made by domestic financial institutions using 
funds from their overseas borrowing and from collecting foreign 
currency deposits will continue to follow the practice that 
repayment of foreign exchange loans is to be made in foreign 
exchange, and the process of repayment are those as described 
above. 
<H3>  VI. To Maintain the Current Foreign Exchange Administration 
for Enterprises With Foreign Investment </H3>
  The enterprises with foreign investment can still keep their 
foreign exchange accounts with either the foreign exchange 
designated banks or foreign banks in China. In cases that the 
external payments of these enterprises are within the scope 
authorized by the State regulation, and that it is to service 
the foreign exchange debts incurred with domestic financial 
institutions, these enterprises may make the payments from the 
outstanding balances of their foreign exchange accounts 
directly. If these enterprises, for the purpose of production, 
operation, debt service, and profit and dividend remittance, 
need more foreign exchange than the outstanding balance of their 
foreign exchange account, after being reviewed and approved by 
the State foreign exchange administrative departments according 
to the documents and contracts authorized by the government 
agencies concerned, they may also purchase foreign exchange from 
the designated banks. 
<H3>  VII. To Cease Domestic Pricing and Settlements in Foreign 
Currency and Prohibit Foreign Currency Circulation in China </H3>
  As of January 1, 1994, any type of domestic pricing and 
settlements in foreign currency shall be ceased, and foreign 
currency circulation and trading of foreign currencies outside 
of the designated financial institutions shall be totally 
prohibited. Issuance of foreign exchange certificates (FEC) will 
also be terminated as of January 1, 1994. But the FEC in 
circulation continues to be valid, and is to be phased out from 
circulation gradually. 
<H3>  VIII. To Enhance Macroeconomic Management of China's 
Balance of Payment </H3>
  Work on analyses and projection of changes and trends of 
China's foreign exchange payment and receipts and its overall 
balance of payments shall be enhanced in order to gradually 
complete our macroeconomic control system over the balance of 
payments. Establishing an efficient and effective balance of 
payment reporting and statistics system, with a view to 
strengthening verification, data-collecting, monitoring, and 
management of foreign exchange receipts and payments, and on 
foreign borrowing, will facilitate our efforts in blocking up 
loopholes, and reducing and eliminating eventually the drain on 
our foreign exchange reserves. All the departments concerned 
shall work together in a timely and co-ordinated fashion to 
resolve problems occurring in our work so as to make sure that 
the forthcoming foreign exchange system reform is implemented 
smoothly.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia agreed today 
to sell 12 billion U.S. dollars worth of highly enriched uranium 
over the next 20 years to the United States, and a senior 
Russian official hailed the deal as "a real move towards genuine 
nuclear disarmament." 
  Under the agreement, signed here during the summit meeting 
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, the U.S. will buy 500 tons of highly enriched uranium 
from dismantled nuclear warheads. 
  As many as 20,000 nuclear warheads would have to be 
dismantled in Russia and Ukraine to provide the agreed amount of 
enriched uranium to the United States, which plans to distribute 
it for use among its 15 nuclear reactors. 
  Russia will receive foreign currency from the transaction, 
and Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan will share in the 
profits. 
  "The agreement means a real move toward genuine nuclear 
disarmament," Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov 
said, while the U.S. pointed out that this will be the first 
time in history that disarmament brings profit to some countries. 
  Announcement of the uranium sale followed the nuclear 
disarmament agreement between the United States, Russia, and 
Ukraine signed by Clinton, Yeltsin and Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk earlier today.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 15 (CNA) -- The government will do its 
best to safeguard the safety and property of overseas Chinese in 
Lesotho in the absence of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries, officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 
Saturday [15 January]. 
  Taiwan suspended diplomatic ties with Lesotho Wednesday 
after 
the Maseru government switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing. 
  Currently, there are about 400 overseas Chinese residing in 
the southern African kingdom, the officials pointed out, adding 
that most of them are doing business in garments, groceries, and 
car repairs. 
  As overseas Chinese have made substantial contributions to 
Lesotho's economy, their safety and property should not be in 
jeopardy, the officials said. 
  Meanwhile, they noted, a 17-member agricultural mission 
previously stationed in Lesotho has withdrawn to neighboring 
South Africa. The mission had been in the Kingdom since the 
re-establishment of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Lesotho 
in 1990. 
  The farm experts will be assigned to new jobs, they added. 
  Du Ling, director of the ministry's African Affairs 
Department, left for Lesotho Thursday to deal with the problems 
resulting from the diplomatic break.

the united front's role in reform and strengthening the party's

  Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
made 
a speech at the conference. 
  He said: The united front work department has the key 
functions for promoting unity, carrying forward socialist 
democracy, safeguarding social stability, narrowing the contacts 
between the party and the masses, strengthening the construction 
of the state political power, and promoting the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland. So, the united front work 
department is the key to building the socialist theory and 
engaging in socialist practice. The united front work, which is 
related to the overall situation, must merely be developed but 
not be suspended. The party should only strengthen but not 
weaken the leadership over the united front work. 
  Sun Weiben stressed: According to the situation and the 
tasks ahead of the united front in the new historical age, we 
know that strengthening and improving the leadership of the 
party should mainly be reflected by ideological guidance, 
organizational leadership, policy guidance, collective 
consultation, and the attention of the whole party. That is, we 
should persistently use Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide the united front 
work and to provide the united front work with a favorable 
organizational guarantee. We should be good at using policy 
means to carry out the united front work, persist in and be good 
at perfecting the political consultation and democratic 
supervision system, and further rely on the forces of the whole 
party and the whole society to achieve the united front work. 
  At the conference, Shan Rongfan, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, delivered a report entitled "Clearly 
Understand the New Situation And Blaze New Trails." [passage 
omitted] 
  During the conference, group meetings were also held to 
discuss the provincial party committee's several opinions on 
strengthening the united front work in the new situation. 
  Present at the conference were some provincial leaders, 
including Zhou Wenhua, Tian Fengshan, Chen Yunlin, An Zhendong, 
Qi Guiyuan, Zhou Tienong, Huang Feng, Fu Shiying, Guo Shouchang, 
Tan Fangzhi, (Zhao Shijie), (Chen Taiyuan), Wang Zhitian, and Wu 
Dinghe.

  [Text] The provincial judicial, procuratorial, and court 
work conference ended in Shenyang on 15 January. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee; and 
Yue Qifeng, governor of the provincial government, called on the 
conference participants and also made important speeches at the 
conference. 
  Gu Jinchi said in his speech that the more we carry out the 
reform and opening up policies and develop the market economy, 
the more we should strengthen the construction of the spiritual 
civilization and pay attention to safeguarding the stability of 
society. 
  He said: The year 1994 is of extreme importance to speeding 
up the setup of the socialist market economic system. Many 
major reform measures will start to be carried out one after 
another. Various kinds of social contradictions and conflicts 
increase, which will add pressure on social stability. The 
party committees and governments at various levels, particularly 
leading cadres, should approach from the high plane of 
consolidating the political power and safeguarding the long-term 
peace and stability of the country to comprehensively and 
accurately analyze the new situation and the new problems, 
constantly remain clear-headed, and try every possible means to 
safeguard political and social stability. The top party and 
government leaders at various levels should take on the 
political responsibility for ensuring safety, personally engage 
in safeguarding sociality, and really embody and implement the 
principle of taking a two-hand approach and being tough with two 
hands. 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: Under the current situation where the 
hot-debated problems are comparatively concentrated, the party 
committees and governments at various levels should 
realistically organize the departments at various levels to 
eliminate difficulties for the people, to do more good and real 
deeds for the people, to pay attention to the interests of the 
people, to ceaselessly improve the people's livelihood, and to 
continuously upgrade their enthusiasm so as to ceaselessly 
deepen the progress of reform. 
  He finally stressed: To safeguard political and social 
stability, we should further strengthen and improve the party's 
leadership over the judicial, procuratorial, and court work so 
as to ensure that the judicial, procuratorial, and court front 
should comprehensively implement the party's line, principles, 
and policies. 
  Governor Yue Qifeng pointed out in his speech: Safeguarding 
stability is the common task of the whole party and the whole 
society, as well as the important duty of the governments at 
various levels. Therefore, the principal leading comrades at 
various levels and the principal administrative leading comrades 
of various responsible departments, enterprises, and 
institutions should have the political and legal responsibility 
for safeguarding the stability of social order. 
  He said: On the one hand, the judicial, procuratorial, and 
court organs should resolutely safeguard the long-term stability 
of social order; on the other land, they should ensure and 
promote the normal and sound operation of the market economy 
according to laws. Thus, the judicial, procuratorial, and 
court departments are required to further emancipate the mind, 
change their ideas, firmly foster the idea of considering 
economic construction as a key link, firmly foster the idea that 
the market economy is the legal economy, and use the arms of 
laws to better serve the economic construction and the progress 
of reform and opening up. 
  Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the provincial government, 
made a summing-up speech at the conference. 
  Some leading comrades, including Chen Suzhi, Zhang Lingyun, 
and (Liu Guoqun), also attended the conference.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yang Ching-hui; from the "Hookup" </F>
program] 
  [Text] High-ranking officials of the Strait Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] and the Mainland Affairs Commission [MAC] held 
a joint closed meeting yesterday. It was pointed out that in 
view of the series of unfriendly acts by the Chinese Communists 
in recent days, which harms the atmosphere of the upcoming talks 
between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei], the meeting 
decided to reexamine the timing of the Chiao-Tang talks; it did 
not exclude the possibility of postponing the talks. 
Yesterday's decision has cast a cloud of uncertainty on whether 
the first high-level meeting between SEF and the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] will be held on 31 
January as scheduled. Here is a report by Yang Ching-hui. 
  [Begin recording] [Yang] The breakfast meeting between MAC 
and SEF put an emergency brake on the Chiao-Tang talks. Kao 
Kung-lien, MAC vice chairman and spokesman, stressed: MAC and 
SEF discussed the Chiao-Tang talks. In light of the current 
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which are 
currently at a low ebb; in light of the unfriendly atmosphere 
surrounding the talks, an atmosphere created by the Chinese 
Communists' attempt to isolate us diplomatically and to forbid 
France to sell us arms; and in view of the fact that Wang 
Chao-kuo [Wang Zhaoguo], Wang Tao-han [Wang Daohan], Tang 
Shu-pei, and others from the mainland have maneuvered for a more 
advantageous position by issuing various statements on eve of 
the talks, it is necessary to reevaluate more profoundly whether 
the talks should be held on schedule. Kao Kung-lien said: 
  [Kao] The Chinese Communists made a special point of 
creating an unfriendly atmosphere, thereby creating obstacles to 
the talks even before they take place. For the sake of avoiding 
political issues, they are actually trying to prevent us from 
enforcing laws under our jurisdiction. We believe there is no 
need to hold the Chiao-Tang talks on schedule, and the matter 
should be reexamined. 
  [Yang] Kao Kung-lien stressed: Unfriendly acts on the part 
of the Chinese Communists have increased in recent days. This 
has had a negative impact on the development of relations 
between the two sides of the Strait. 
  [Kao] The Chinese Communists' attempt to isolate us 
diplomatically and to suppress us militarily will only create 
resentment among the general public on Taiwan. This will 
certainly have a very negative impact on cross-Strait relations. 
In our view, the Chinese Communists' acts have never departed 
from their old mentality (words indistinct). This will only 
result in the waste of the resources of the Chinese people. If 
they do not change their mentality and adopt a policy of 
promoting coexistence and common prosperity, it will be 
difficult for cross-Strait relations to develop further. 
  [Yang] MAC held that because the Chinese Communists do not 
want to alter their rigid mentality, we cannot help but 
reevaluate the timing of the Chiao-Tang talks. Kao Kung-lien 
stressed that although he would not go so far as to say the 
Chiao-Tang talks will be canceled, it is likely the talks will 
be postponed. Our side will inform ARATS following the 
reevaluation. However, there will be no major changes in the 
government's general policy direction toward the mainland. [end

  [Text] Minister of National Defense Sun Chen yesterday 
presided over a ceremony for the opening of this year's group 
training of students of universities and colleges at 
Chengkungling Base in Taichung County. He later expressed his 
views in light of France's statement concerning arms sales to 
our country and pointed out that past contracts signed with 
France for the procurement of weapons would continue to be 
implemented and that all kinds of parts and logistical supports 
can also be obtained through various channels. The following is 
a report from Ouyang Ho: 
  More than 19,000 students from various universities and 
colleges have taken part in this year's group training. 
Minister of National Defense Sun Chen presided over a ceremony 
for the opening of this year's group training. He first 
(?handed over a gun) to a representative of students taking part 
in the group training. (Li Cheng-wei), student of [words 
indistinct] industrial institute, took an oath on behalf of all 
students. 
  Minister Sun Chen later delivered a speech to the students. 
[words indistinct] After the completion of the ceremony, a 
number of reporters interviewed Minister Sun Chen. Reporters 
asked him whether France would implement its contracts with 
Taiwan on arms procurement and whether this will seriously 
affect the repair, maintenance and supply of parts for 
French-made weapons used by our armed forces, since France might 
stop arms sales to the Taiwan region under the pressure of 
Communist China. 
  National Defense Minister Sun Chen said: The Ministry of 
National Defense has already made appropriate arrangements. 
[Begin recording] [Sun] The past procurement contracts (?will 
not be abrogated) and we will make appropriate arrangements for 
logistical support in the future. [end recording]

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 17 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said Monday [17 January] that Taiwan may 
unilaterally lower import tariffs prior to holding tariff 
consultations with the United States Jan. 19-20. 
  The move will help Taiwan avoid additional tariff cuts 
during 
later negotiations about Taiwan's entry to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Chiang said after meeting with 
visiting British Deputy Secretary of Trade and Industry 
Christopher Roberts. 
  The United States has asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 699 
farm 
and industrial products by as much as 50 percent. U.S. 
negotiators have also been opposed to a Taiwan suggestion that 
the tariff cuts be included as part of expected GATT-related 
tariff cuts. 
  If Taiwan gives in to both U.S. and GATT demands, Chiang 
said, Taiwan would have to cut import tariffs twice. 
  However, a unilateral tariff reduction prior to negotiations 
with the U.S. would effectively help minimize any undesirable 
impact, Chiang added. 
  Meanwhile, Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of 
Foreign Trade left Taiwan Monday for Washington, D.C., where he 
will take part in tariff negotiations with U.S. Trade 
Representative Office officials. 
  Huang said prior to his departure that government agencies 
have concluded that Taiwan can allow tariff cuts for only 10 
percent of the industrial products requested by the United 
States, and tariffs will not be reduced on any agricultural 
items.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 15 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic 
Affairs has drafted a three-year plan to promote trade and 
economic cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, Vice 
Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said Saturday [15 
January]. 
  "The plan is part of the government's much-publicized 
`southern strategy' to strengthen economic ties with Southeast 
Asia," Sheu explained. 
  "It is devised to provide more assistance to Taiwan 
entrepreneurs in their business and investment activities in the 
region," Sheu noted. 
  "By doing this we hope our manufacturers will divert some of 
their investment from Mainland China to Southeast Asian nations 
and thus help reduce Taiwan's growing economic dependence on the 
mainland," Sheu said. 
  Under the plan, Sheu said, the government will seek to 
eliminate investment barriers and expand bilateral trade and 
technological cooperation with ASEAN member states and 
Indochinese countries. In the initial stages, the plan will 
target Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia, he explained. 
  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and 
Thailand, while Indochinese countries include Vietnam, Laos and 
Cambodia. 
  Sheu said government research units will intensify study of 
economic activities, investment climate and trade regulations in 
Southeast Asian nations, and delegations will be organized to 
visit the region to collect first-hand information. 
  The economics ministry will help local manufacturers find 
suitable sites to accommodate production facilities and 
distribution centers in Southeast Asian countries, Sheu noted. 
  The ministry will also make good use of the international 
economic cooperation and development fund to boost economic 
relations with Southeast Asian countries. 
  In addition, the ministry will hold regular trade 
consultations with its Southeast Asian counterparts to resolve 
bilateral trade issues and work out possible cooperative 
projects. 
  Over the next three years, Sheu said, the government will 
invite influential Southeast Asian finance officials, bankers 
and business leaders to visit Taiwan. 
  "The move aims to help Taiwan businessmen with interests in 
Southeast Asia get loans to finance their operations there," 
Sheu noted. 
  The government will also ask Southeast Asian countries to 
simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen and set up a 
"Taipei desk" in their government investment offices to offer 
information and counseling services for Taiwan investors. 
  Sheu said the plan will be sent to the Executive Yuan for 
deliberation and approval. A special committee formed by 
high-ranking officials from related government agencies will 
meet every three months to check the plan's progress, he added.

  [Text] Taipei, Jun. 14 (CNA) -- The Mainland Affairs 
Council (MAC) on Friday [14 January] agreed to a request by a 
local airline [words indistinct] demanded that their passenger 
airplanes bound for [words indistinct] permitted to make 
emergency landing in mainland China. 
  MAC Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien told the press that his 
council has no intention to intervene in emergency landings. 
"The request is merely for safety considerations...it has 
nothing to do with the establishment of direct air links with 
the mainland," Kao stressed. 
  Formosa Airlines will begin flight service from Taipei to 
Matsu on Jan. 17. Matsu is about 10 nautical miles off the 
coast of Mainland China. 
  The airline asked the Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications to make the emergency landing request to the 
mainland authority. 
  A ministry official, however, asserted that the likelihood 
of 
landing on the mainland is small as long as pilots fly planes in 
accordance with standard procedures required by the Civil 
Aeronautics Administration.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 15 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] will lend an additional US$10 million to Vietnam to help 
the Indochinese country build an industrial park in Hanoi to 
house Taiwan-invested factories, Vice Economic Affairs Minister 
Sheu Ke-sheng said Saturday [15 January]. 
  "The move proves that our government attaches great 
importance to strengthening trade and economic cooperation 
[words indistinct] Vietnam," said Sheu, who returned to Taipei 
Thursday from a visit to Hanoi. 
  The five-year loan, with an interest rate of 7 percent per 
annum, will be administered by the Vietnamese central bank to 
help Taiwan land developers build a 200-hectare industrial zone 
in Vietnam's capital city, Sheu noted. 
  The money will come from the International Economic 
Cooperation and Development Fund established by the ROC 
Government in 1989 to offer financial aid to needy developing 
countries. 
  Taiwan has already lent Vietnam US$30 million to expand a 
highway and another US$15 million to fund the development of 
small- and medium-sized Vietnamese companies. 
  The planned Hanoi industrial park will be the second such 
zone Taiwan has helped build in Vietnam. A similar industrial 
park has been set up in Ho Chi Minh City to house 
Taiwan-invested firms. 
  There are some 700 Taiwan-invested companies in Ho Chi Minh 
City and more than 40 local manufacturers have expressed 
intention to set up production lines in Hanoi, Sheu reported. 
  Taiwan businessmen have poured more than US$1.2 billion for 
various investment projects in Vietnam since the late 1980s, 
making Taiwan one of Vietnam's major foreign capital source. 
  Sheu said the government will send investment officials to 
Vietnam in the near future to help that country simplify its 
investment procedures.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhaoguo, 
director of the Office of Taiwan Affairs of the State Council, 
today stressed that China resolutely opposes any forms of claims 
and actions regarding "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan". 
  Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
reiterated that China also resolutely opposes any attempts to 
create "Taiwan independence." 
  Wang made the remark at the Third Meeting of the First 
Council of the Chinese Mainland's Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS). 
  After reviewing the progress between the relations across 
the 
Taiwan Strait, Wang said that the relations across the Taiwan 
Strait saw great development last year. 
  He said that the publication of the White Paper "The Taiwan 
Question and the Reunification of China" made a complete and 
systematic exposition of China's principled stance and policies 
on the Taiwan issue, producing a realistic and far-reaching 
impact on the development of the relations across the straits 
and the reunification of China. 
  Wang said that at the 48th General Assembly of the United 
Nations, the Taiwan authorities' attempt to "participate in the 
United Nations" was thwarted. 
  He noted that recently some people in Taiwan advocated a 
step 
by step approach to two Chinas, which roused serious attention 
and vigilance on China's mainland. 
  However, he said, Taiwan patriots including men of insight 
among the Taiwan authorities have made great efforts to develop 
the relations across the straits. 
  Last year the Taiwan authorities relaxed some restrictions 
over exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan and adopted some 
measures conducive to promoting mutual understanding and 
exchanges across the Strait. 
  He said, "We hope the Taiwan authorities uphold the sense of 
Chinese nation and truly adhere to the principle of one China so 
as to contribute to the development of the relations across the 
straits and the peaceful reunification of the motherland." 
  Wang spoke highly of ARATS' work to promote the exchanges 
between the mainland and Taiwan in the past two years. 
  He said that from January to November last year, the 
indirect 
trade value between the two sides reached 12.1 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  Last year more than 1.5 million Taiwan compatriots visited 
the mainland and more and more mainland people also went to 
Taiwan. 
  He called on ARATS to make efforts to promote exchanges of 
mail services, air and shipping services and trade across the 
straits, promote exchanges and cooperation between the people on 
the two sides, and especially to develop economic cooperation. 
  ARATS should help related sectors and localities to solve 
the 
problems arising in the exchanges between the people of the two 
sides and protect the legal rights and interests of the mainland 
and Taiwan people, he added. 
  He urged ARATS to promote talks on economic and civil 
affairs 
with its Taiwan counterpart. 
  He said that the leaders of ARATS and the Taiwan-based 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will regularly hold talks in 
line with the agreements concluded at the "Wang-Ku" meeting and 
he hoped that ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Ku 
Chen-fu will hold their second meeting soon.

<F P=106> [From the "Report on Current Events" program] </F>
  [Text] Dear listeners: On 13 January, Wang Zhaoguo, vice 
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] National Committee and director of the 
Offices of Taiwan Affairs of the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council, stressed that China resolutely opposes any form of 
claims of two Chinas, one China and one Taiwan, or two equal 
political entities, and that it resolutely opposes any claims 
and actions aimed at promoting Taiwan's independence. 
  Addressing the third meeting of the First Council of the 
Chinese mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS], Wang Zhaoguo said: Relations across the Taiwan 
Strait made major advances last year. The publication of the 
white paper on the Taiwan Issue and China's reunification, which 
comprehensively and systematically expounds China's principled 
stand and policies on the Taiwan issue, has had both an 
immediate and far-reaching impact on the development of 
relations across the strait and on China's reunification. After 
the attempt by the Taiwan authorities to participate in the 
United Nations was thwarted at the 48th UN General Assembly, 
some people in Taiwan began to publicly advocate the so-called 
two Chinas as a phase. This merits our close attention and 
vigilance. 
  Speaking of the working-level talks between the two sides of 
the Taiwan Strait, Wang Zhaoguo said: The characteristics of 
the working-level talks between the ARATS and the Strait 
Exchange Foundation [SEF] have become somewhat different from 
those of the past. This is reflected mainly in the fact that 
the SEF tried to use the handling of administrative matters to 
create so-called independent sovereignty and complete judicial 
jurisdiction, thereby achieving the goal of making the mainland 
and Taiwan two equal political entities. 
  Wang Zhaoguo stressed: In light of this, we must uphold the 
principle of one China and, based on the common understanding 
that the ARATS-SEF talks are nongovernment, economic, 
administrative, and functional in nature, avoid sensitive 
political issues to seek common ground while putting aside 
differences. We must make active efforts to advance the talks 
and to produce positive results on administrative matters. 
  Wang Zhaoguo spoke highly of the ARATS's fruitful efforts in 
promoting cross-strait exchanges and developing relations 
between the two sides in the two years since its establishment. 
  He said: During the last year, thanks to the joint efforts 
of all localities and departments and the people throughout the 
country, including the Taiwan people, economic and trade 
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have 
developed more rapidly. Exchanges in personnel and in other 
areas have made new breakthroughs. The number of Taiwan 
businesses investing in the mainland has increased sharply. 
From January to November of last year, indirect trade between 
the two sides reached $12.1 billion. The two sides have forged 
closer economic interests. More than 1.5 million people visited 
the mainland from Taiwan last year. The number of people from 
Taiwan's higher hierarchy and public figures from all walks of 
life has increased 50 percent from the same period in 1992. 
More people from the mainland also visited Taiwan to carry out 
a wide range of exchanges. Facts show that exchanges in 
personnel and in other areas have a positive impact on the 
development of relations across the strait. 
  Wang Zhaoguo called for consistent efforts to promote the 
establishment of direct postal, trade, and navigational ties 
between the two sides and to push for the exchanges between 
people on the mainland and Taiwan and exchanges and cooperation 
in every field in accordance with the policies of peaceful 
reunification and one country and two systems. He called for 
vigorous economic cooperation in particular to jointly 
revitalize China's national economy. 
  He said: In line with the development of the situation, the 
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office will coordinate with the 
relevant State Council departments to authorize the ARATS to 
hold talks with Taiwan's SEF on economic matters, science and 
technology exchanges, and cooperation in the development of 
energy resources, while continuing their talks on administrative 
matters. 
  He urged the ARATS and SEF to institutionalize meetings 
between their responsible persons and to further promote contact 
and cooperation with each other in accordance with the relevant 
agreements reached during the Wang-Gu talks. He also said that 
he hoped to see an early, successful materialization of the 
second meeting between Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu 
[Ku Chen- fu] to advance the development of cross-strait 
relations.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan Affairs 
Office under the State Council today held a forum to discuss 
Deng Xiaoping's scientific thought of "peaceful reunification" 
and "one country, two systems". 
  Wang Zhaoguo, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, said 
the 
principle of "one country, two systems" is the concrete 
application of Marxism in contemporary China. 
  Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that it 
is the outcome of the party's line of seeking truth from fact 
and constitutes one important part of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  He called for earnest study and implementation of Deng's 
idea 
of "peaceful reunification" of the motherland and "one country, 
two systems", adherence to the one China principle, safeguarding 
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and opposition to 
any advocacy of "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" and 
"Taiwan independence". 
  Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association of the Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that his association 
aims to develop the exchanges and relations across the Taiwan 
Straits and to promote peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
  He said that with the approach of the 21st century, the 
Mainland and Taiwan should enhance their economic cooperation to 
attain mutual benefits. 
  Cai Zimin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan 
Democratic Self-Government League, said that the Taiwan people 
have a patriotic tradition which remains unchanged. 
  He said that the principle of "one country, two systems" 
respects the realities on the two sides across the Taiwan 
Straits and agrees with the Taiwan compatriots' wish for being 
their own masters. 
  He said that the claims for "two Chinas" and "one China, one 
Taiwan" advocated by some people in Taiwan or outside Taiwan are 
doomed to fail.

<F P=106> [From "The News at 8:00" program--passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] The governor, Chris Patten, will be flying to 
London tomorrow for high-level talks with cabinet ministers on 
the Hong Kong question. Speaking after an opening ceremony 
today, Patten stressed that Britain will not abandon what it 
believes to be right for the territory. That is despite China's 
threat to revamp after 1997 all electoral arrangements 
unilaterally laid down by Britain before the takeover. Linda Li 
reports: 
  [Li] "Governor Chris Patten remains as defiant as he is, 
though many question how Hong Kong will benefit from his 
electoral reform proposals when they will last only up to 
mid-1997." 
  [Patten] "It isn't a very persuasive argument to say, that 
if China chooses to or says it will break all the windows after 
1997, that we should break them in 1994 and 1995." 
  [Li] "It's discharging British sovereignty, Patten stresses, 
to put in place a fair and reasonable set of electoral 
arrangements for Hong Kong's district organizations and 
Legislative Council [Legco]. Talking about his trip to London 
tomorrow, Patten believes the British ministers will want to 
hear his views on when to table the second portion of his 
political reform bill in Legco. The main consideration, he says, 
is to proceed in a sensible, step- by-step manner, and the 
priority is to get the present bill onto the statue book. In a 
separate interview with the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, 
Patten said he would be disappointed if Legco didn't pass his 
bill." 
  [Patten] "I certainly don't intend to put proposals to the 
Legislative Council which I would like the Legislative Council 
to water down or change in some way. That's not political 
leadership." 
  [Li] "While Patten appears to be a tiger in a battlefield, 
he's willing to bow out gracefully from the political scene in 
three and a half years' time." 
  [Patten] "And I rather doubt whether there is a life in 
politics -- in British politics for me after this. After this I 
will be 52, 53. On present likelihood, it would be between 
elections. I wouldn't be able to fight an election for another 
two or three years after that. I think I will be looking to 
other forms of public service after this job." 
  [Li] "But until then, the governor vows to stay on until 
June 30, 1997. Linda Li, TVB News."

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 18 (AFP)--Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten leaves here Tuesday [18 January] for London for a regular 
review of British policy on the territory with renewed call for 
China to resume talks on democratic reforms in the colony. 
Patten angered Beijing by submitting parts of his controversial 
reform package on electoral reform last month after 17 rounds of 
talks on the issue between Britain and China failed to reach any 
agreement. 
  He told reporters before leaving for London that "we hope 
... 
that talks can be resumed." "If we're not able to resume 
discussions as we would like then we will have to discharge our 
responsibilities without there having been an agreement," he 
said. 
  However, Patten, who will give evidence to the House of 
Commons' foreign affairs select committee in London during his 
visit ending Monday, said: "I think it's unlikely that we would 
want to go ahead with the last stage of legislations while the 
present bill is in the Legislative Council." 
  "I think ideally we'd want to see the Legislative Council 
deal with that bill first and then move on to next one but ... 
we need this bill in order to get on with drawing up the 
register of voters in the spring, in April," he said. 
  The governor said he would be attending a meeting with other 
ministers to consider the progress of the legislation on 
political development in Hong Kong and the next steps to take if 
China refused any further resumption of talks, while in London. 
Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

  [Text] The head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, Lu Ping, is reported to have insisted that part of the 
territory's financial reserves should be spent on the new 
airport. Mr. Lu also said the door to further talks on the 
territory's political future was still open. For the details, 
here's Joseph Tsang: 
  [Begin Tsang recording] According to a spokesman for a 
delegation of young Fukienese businessmen from Hong Kong 
visiting Beijing, Mr. Lu failed to see why the reserves could 
not injected into the airport projects, because he believed the 
economy of Hong Kong should yield more than HK$100,000 million 
[Hong Kong dollars] in reserves by 1997. He reportedly said 
Beijing had submitted several airport financing proposals to the 
British side, but there had been no response. And he was said 
to have accused the British side of failing to stick to the 
Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport when 
making financing proposals for the projects. 
  Mr. Lu also said Beijing had informed Britain through 
diplomatic channels that it sincerely wanted to hold further 
talks on the territory's political future, but China was 
dissatisfied with the tabling of a partial electoral bill in 
Legco [Legislative Council] on the governor's political proposal 
during such negotiations. He says such a move was not worthy of 
a gentleman, and was that of a vile character. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By our political desk] </F>
  [Text] China has responded to the Government's third 
financial package on the Chek Lap Kok airport, according to a 
senior mainland official. 
  The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Lu Ping, was quoted yesterday as saying Beijing 
had already responded to the British side's recent concern over 
financial arrangements for the new airport. 
  After meeting Mr. Lu in Beijing, the spokesman for the 
Junior 
Chamber of Commerce, Ng Man-kun, quoted the official as saying 
China had yet to receive feedback on its reply to the Government. 
  But he said Mr. Lu "did not go into detail about what their 
response was". 
  A Government spokesman said last night: "We have not seen 
Mr. Lu's precise remarks and as both the Governor and the 
Financial Secretary said last week, the right place to discuss 
these issues is within the Airport Committee. 
  "We have been pressing the Chinese side for a meeting but 
have had no response. We have also called for expert talks on 
land matters and again we have had no response." 
  Financing of the new airport has been deadlocked since 
August's Airport Committee meeting. It is understood the 
Government has held a number of informal discussions with the 
Chinese side. 
  Legislator Samuel Wong Ping-wai, who convenes the 
Legislative 
Council Airport Committee, urged both sides to release more 
information about the financial arrangements. "The fund is the 
money of Hong Kong people," he said. 
  According to Mr. Ng, Mr. Lu had again accused the Government 
of mixing politics with business by refusing to send officials 
to Beijing to explain the Airport Corporation Bill to the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). 
  "Mr. Lu said he had read the contents of the bill several 
times but there were many things he could not understand and 
things that were unclear," he said. 
  "Therefore, he hoped the PWC, being the main adviser to the 
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), could be 
more familiar with it." 
  The Government is to decide tomorrow on which funding 
proposal will be submitted to the Legislative Council. 
  The funding proposals -- either a $377 million suggestion to 
retain the operations of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) 
or a $1.6 billion proposal to keep the PAA and urgent airport 
projects going -- will be tabled during the Finance Committee 
meeting on Friday. 
  Meanwhile, the controversial partial political reform bill 
passed the Legislative Council bills committee yesterday and is 
now headed for final approval.

<F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Governor Chris Patten on 
Monday said China was flip-flopping on the issue of Hong Kong's 
new airport, and pressed once again for talks to resume on 
financing the mammoth project. Speaking to reporters, Patten 
said he was "a little puzzled" by remarks last week by a senior 
Chinese official that Beijing thinks Hong Kong should spend more 
of its reserves on the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok 
project. 
  "Sometimes they say we shouldn't put more money into the 
airport. Sometimes they say that we should. Sometimes they say 
both things in the same paragraph," he said. The best solution, 
he said, was for the airport committee of the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group -- charged with hammering out the details of Hong 
Kong's return to China in 1997 -- to meet as soon as possible. 
  "I'm very happy to try to resolve these matters sooner than 
later in the airport committee. That's what the people of Hong 
Kong would like to do, too," he said. 
  Patten spoke as his administration said it was pressing 
ahead 
with a request to the Legislative Council for 1.67 billion Hong 
Kong dollars (216 million U.S.) to keep the project going for 
another few months. 
  Site preparation is nearing completion, but contracts have 
yet to be issued for the airport's futuristic terminal, as well 
as for the runway and maintenance facilities. 
  In remarks Tuesday in Beijing, Lu Ping, director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned Hong Kong against going it 
alone with Chek Lap Kok, one of the world's biggest public works 
projects. He also said the thriving colony could "inject a 
certain amount" into the project, given its bulging reserves 
which he put at more than 100 billion dollars (12.9 billion 
U.S.). Yet when the project was first announced in 1989, China 
feared its mammoth scope would bankrupt Hong Kong. 
  Under a 1991 agreement intended to allay that concern, 
Britain agreed to secure China's approval for debt financing for 
Chek Lap Kok, which also includes new roads and bridges, a 
commuter train line and seaport facilities. But negotiations on 
financing arrangements soon fell victim to a shrill bilateral 
row over Patten's efforts to reform Hong Kong's political system 
ahead of 1997. Sino-British talks on political reform broke 
down in November, prompting the governor to press ahead with the 
changes unilaterally. 
  Speaking Monday, Secretary for the Treasury Donald Tsang 
said 
the government was dropping one of two options it put to 
legislators last week to keep the project going, pending an 
agreement with China. That option would have limited stop-gap 
funding to a one-off grant of 377 million dollars (48.77 million 
U.S.) to keep the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA), set up to 
run the new airport, running for another year. 
  Instead, Tsang said, it would press for the second, 1.67 
billion dollar option that comprises the letting out of three 
upcoming contracts, plus the funding for the PAA. 
  "We believe that there is a clear view in the community that 
we should press ahead with the airport project as speedily and 
efficiently as we can, while continuing to seek agreement with 
the Chinese side," Tsang said.

  [Text] At the beginning of the year, a number of 
enthusiastic social groups and figures have organized varied 
activities one after another to introduce the Basic Law and 
encourage residents to show concern for and understand the Basic 
Law. 
  The Basic Law is the supreme statute of the Hong Kong 
Special

implementing the policies of "one country, two systems" and 
"Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong," and a code of conduct for 
the vast number of Hong Kong people after 1997. For Hong Kong 
people, once they have mastered the Basic Law, they will have 
the future of Hong Kong and their destiny in their own hands. 
  Although the statute will go into effect commencing 1 July 
1997, there are questions of political, economic, social, legal, 
and cultural convergence with the Basic Law in the latter 
transition period of three years or so, which will ensure Hong 
Kong's prosperity, stability, and a smooth transition. For this 
reason, we should understand and master the Basic Law now. The 
closer we are to 1997, the more such an understanding will be 
important. An increasing number of people have acknowledged 
this point. 
  A large number of people will probably have to thank Patten. 
Besides understanding the Basic Law during activities to 
introduce the Basic Law, they have also realized the importance 
of the Basic Law through the actions of Patten, who has served 
as their teacher. Some of them said: "Patten has `taught' us 
how to understand the Basic Law." 
  Upon his arrival in Hong Kong, Patten made use of the 
weaknesses of some Hong Kong people, who lack an understanding 
of the Basic Law, to carry out deceptive activities. 
  The first example: Patten used "democracy" to cheat the 
public. He disguised himself as a "defender of democracy," 
attributing differences between China and Britain to "offering 
democracy to Hong Kong people." Some people believed this at 
first. A review of Hong Kong's history and the articles of the 
Basic Law enabled them to understand that Hong Kong people would 
enjoy more democracy after 1997 than in the period under British 
colonial rule. 
  The second example: Patten also made an issue of "freedom." 
He attempted to connect the case of the mainland's handling of 
Han Dongfang and others according to the law with Hong Kong's 
personal freedom, freedom of entry and exit, and freedom of the 
press after 1997, which had nothing to do with each other, 
saying that this would make Hong Kong people "worry" about their 
freedom after 1997. It was a "worry" created by Patten. The 
public felt relieved after reading the Basic Law and realizing 
that they would enjoy freedom in dozens of fields after 1997, 
which is rare compared with other parts of the world. 
  What Patten has done and said has profoundly educated Hong 
Kong people: If they do not understand the Basic Law, they will 
be easily led by others and bring trouble on themselves. 
Despite the great impact on Hong Kong, one person said, he is 
confident for the future because of the Basic Law. Only by 
understanding the Basic Law can we be free of anxiety and panic. 
  The public has noticed that Patten and his ilk have recently 
changed their tactics from the offensive to the defensive in 
dealing with the Basic Law. It is clear that they are against 
the Basic Law. Some of them even burnt the Basic Law and 
described it as "leash" not long ago. However, they have 
recently changed their position and have become "defenders" of 
the Basic Law, occasionally blaming the Chinese side for "not 
understanding the Basic Law," "violating the Basic Law," and 
"usurping the power to interpret the Basic Law." 
  In order to attain the goal of letting the Legislative 
Council [Legco] examine and adopt his "three violations" 
constitutional package and continue the position of 
confrontation with China, Patten intentionally confused the 
essential differences between the current Legco and the future 
legislature, applying the provisions of the Basic Law that the 
legislature had the power to draft, revise, and revoke laws to 
deny the fact that Legco is a consultative organ and to enhance 
its status. He even made unfounded countercharges, saying that 
"he who holds that the Legco has no right to make legislation 
does not understand the Basic Law." As a matter of fact, people 
with a little understanding of the Basic Law and the Royal 
Instructions can easily see through the absurdity and motives of 
Patten's remarks. 
  A spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office made a statement last month, pointing out that 
the terms of the three-tier councils of the British Hong Kong 
Government will be terminated and they will have to be disbanded 
along with the end of British rule. This is quite reasonable. 
However, Patten labeled the statement as "undermining the Basic 
Law," saying that "the statement runs counter to Article 160 of 
the Basic Law" and "usurps the power of the National People's 
Congress in interpreting the Basic Law." Those best qualified 
to speak on the question, the legal experts, who participated in 
the drafting of the Basic Law, said: "Article 160 involves a 
legal issue while the statement of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office refers to principled questions of state 
sovereignty, the British colonialists ending their 
administration of Hong Kong, and the British Hong Kong 
authorities having no right to extend their political framework 
beyond 1997. Patten's accusation is irrelevant to the subject, 
which only proves his ignorance of the Basic Law." Actually, it 
was the British Hong Kong authorities which made an erroneous 
interpretation of the Basic Law. Patten once tried to explain 
Article 104 of the Basic Law on the oath of office by members of 
the legislature and officials of the SAR government as objective 
criterion for the through train [legislators serving beyond 30 
June 1997]. This serves as an example. 
  Patten has given people another lesson: Only by 
understanding the Basic Law can we dispel the mist spread by 
Patten, see through the demarcation line between right and wrong 
confused by him, and recognize his true features. 
  We do not know what tricks he will continue to play in 
distorting and confronting the Basic Law. However, we believe 
that after every trick played by him, Hong Kong people will have 
a better understanding of the Basic Law. Patten is indeed a 
rare teacher by negative example.

  [TExt] China is considering whether to invite dozens of 
community leaders to join another platform of advisers on Hong 
Kong affairs, according to sources. 
  Beijing would then have three groups working on the 
transition in 1997: the high-level Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC) chaired by the deputy Prime Minister Qian 
Qichen, the 91 Hong Kong advisers appointed by the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office and the local branch of XINHUA (the NEW 
CHINA NEWS AGENCY) and the district-level group. 
  The creation of the lesser tier would help satisfy the 
enthusiasm of a number of community figures who want to become 
Hong Kong Affairs Advisers. 
  A source said the appointment of advisers on district 
matters 
was a new idea which fitted Beijing's strategy of boosting ties 
at all levels following the breakdown of political co-operation 
with London. 
  The source said that after declaring that it would step up 
its own preparations for the 1997 handover, Beijing had shifted 
the emphasis from seeking co-operation with Whitehall to 
expanding its so-called united front in the territory. 
  Senior Chinese officials have indicated that they would 
increase the membership of the PWC and name a third batch of 
Hong Kong Affairs Advisers. 
  It is understood that Beijing is still finalising the two 
lists of appointees and calculating the best timing for such an 
announcement. 
  The Hong Kong and British governments already fear that the 
establishment of these groups ahead of the Preparatory Committee 
for the Special Administrative Region in 1996 is tantamount to 
creating an alternate power base to its own administration. 
  It is understood that 10 more people would be named to sit 
on 
the 57-member PWC, which comes under the auspices of the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee. 
  Of the 57, 30 are local dignitaries and six of the 10 
newcomers are expected to come from the territory. 
  It is also expected that at least two more local delegates 
of 
the NPC will be enlisted. 
  The front-runners are tipped to include unionist Cheng 
Yiu-tong, surveyor Kan Fook-yee and geography lecturer Victor 
Sit Fungshuen. 
  It is understood that Beijing may approach a few senior 
government officials who have either been retired or left the 
bureaucracy. 
  These include former treasury secretary Yeung Kai-yin and 
former secretary for education and manpower John Chan Cho-chak. 
But both have said privately they would not accept such an 
invitation. 
  The source said it was now likely that the NPC Standing 
Committee would finalise the list of new PWC members at a 
meeting next month. 
  It will also be around the time that invitations will be 
extended to the third batch of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers, whose 
number is yet to be decided but is said to be in the range of 50 
to 100. 
  In spite of the significant jump in the number of advisers, 
sources said local Xinhua officials began a few months ago to 
consider the possibility of naming a separate group of district 
affairs advisers. 
  But a district leader who has been asked about the idea 
said: 
"I don't think it" appropriate now. It will create different 
classes -- on territory-wide and district affairs. 
  "Those who are invited to become district affairs advisers 
might not be happy to accept the offer," he said.

<F P=106> [By Michael Smith] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong's powerful Liberal Party has completed a 
survey which will determine Hong Kong's constitutional future by 
guiding the crucial vote on Governor Chris Patten's partial 
reform bill. The Liberal Party's Standing Committee yesterday 
deferred until tomorrow the final decision which will determine 
the success of Patten's bill. The party is considering opting 
for a "free vote" which will clear it of adopting a firm stance 
on political reform and allow an individual vote. 
  The fate of the constitutional package will be determined 
after more discussions within the conservative party. The 
government needs the vote of the Liberal Party's 15 legislators 
to ensure the bill passes the Legislative Council. But the 
party is deeply divided, with several legislators already 
indicating they may vote against their party to oppose the 
abolition of appointed seats for district boards. 
  The party has completed an independent survey of its 
1,400-strong membership and several functional constituency 
polls on the controversial proposals. Results were said to be 
mixed, delaying any clear policy on the subject for a few days. 
  It was also revealed Liberal Party legislator Howard Young 
could join colleague James Tien in opposing the abolition of 
appointed seats. Young's surveys of his functional constituency 
show support for appointed seats. Young said he would "weigh up 
very carefully" the Liberal Party's final stance before a 
decision was made. But if the party applied a "free vote" it is 
likely he would oppose the abolition of appointed seats -- which 
is a key part of Patten's package. He said a lot of people have 
reservations about giving up appointed seats and he claimed 
there was "great" regret in bringing the bill forward without 
China's blessing. One survey indicated Young's constituency was 
also opposed to lowering the voting age to 18. 
  Tien has indicated he would introduce an amendment opposing 
the abolition no matter what his party decided. Under the 
Liberal Party constitution appointed members are allowed to vote 
against the party and support constituents' views. 
  Support for Patten's partial bill appears to be on the wane 
in the Legislative Council after the breakdown in Sino-British 
relations and future threats to the legislature after 1997. 
Legislators say privately there is only 50 percent support for 
the bill and success or failure hinges on the Liberal Party's 
vote. 
  The Liberal Party said it would support the bill if 
introduced with China's blessing. But last month it reserved a 
decision until a membership opinion poll was carried out. 
Liberal legislator Henry Tang said the party had to come up 
with a more definitive answer to the problem. 
  The United Democrats indicated they would back the bill but 
would amend it to include more democratic elections in 1995. 
Independent legislator Eric Li is also set to introduce an 
amendment opposing the abolition of appointed seats.

  [Text] Manila, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China today urged 
Asia- Pacific countries to exert concerted efforts to ensure a 
sustained and steady economic growth in each country and the 
region as a whole. 
  Tong Zhiguang, member of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress of China, said Asia-Pacific countries 
should have a long-term strategic perspective and look ahead in 
the 21st century. 
  Tong is here to attend the second general meeting of the 
Asia- Pacific parliamentary forum, which opened this morning. 
  There are tremendous potentials in economic cooperation 
among 
countries in the Asia-Pacific region as their economies are 
highly compatible and complementary with each other, Tong said. 
  While stressing the importance of regional cooperation, Tong 
said that only with a development strategy compatible with its 
own conditions, can a country attain economic prosperity. 
  "After all, there can be no regional prosperity without the 
development of the component countries," Tong said. 
  He also told more than the 100 delegates from 18 countries 
that China has achieved phenomenal accomplishments in economic 
development during the past 15 years thanks mainly to the 
economic reform and opening-up policies. 
  One of the China's basic policies, Tong said, is open to the 
entire world, primarily to the Asia-Pacific region. 
  "It is our firm policy to expand economic cooperation and 
trade with other Asia-Pacific countries," he added. 
  Tong also appreciated the result of Seattle meeting of Asia- 
Pacific Economic Cooperation in last November, saying it would 
have a positive bearing on facilitating the regional economic 
cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, January 16 (XINHUA) -- Newly-released 
official statistics indicate that Japan ranks first among 
China's top ten trading partners. 
  Statistics from the General Administration of Customs show 
that the total trade volume between China and Japan last year 
reached 39.04 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland's biggest trading partner in 
1992, now is second on the list, followed by the United States. 
  The mainland's trade volume with Hong Kong and the United 
States last year was 32.54 billion U.S. dollars and 27.65 
billion U.S. dollars respectively. 
  The figure for Sino-U.S. trade in 1993 rose by more than 10 
billion U.S. dollars over the preceding year. 
  The volume of indirect trade between the Chinese mainland 
and 
Taiwan province rose to 14.39 billion U.S. dollars, placing the 
province fourth on the list, one position ahead of Germany. 
  China's trade ties with Germany developed at a steady pace 
and bilateral trade volume last year surpassed 10 billion U.S. 
dollars for the first time. Germany is also China's largest 
trading partner among the European Economic Community countries. 
  Although trade volume between China and the Republic of 
Korea 
(ROK) last year failed to reach 10 billion U.S. dollars as was 
expected, ROK still has become China's sixth largest trading 
partner, surpassing Russia, which dropped from sixth to seventh 
place. 
  The trade volume between China and ROK last year was 8.22 
billion U.S. dollars, some 540 million U.S. dollars more than 
the figure for that between China and Russia. 
  The eighth and the ninth trading partners of the Chinese 
mainland in 1993 were still Singapore and Italy, with which 
China's trade increased steadily. 
  Canada, China's tenth largest trade partner in 1992, was 
replaced by Britain on the list. Trade between China and 
Britain last year was 3.59 billion U.S. dollars. 
  According to customs statistics, China registered a trade 
deficit with all top ten trading partners except for Hong Kong, 
the United States and Britain. 
  The Chinese mainland faced a deficit of 11.47 billion U.S. 
dollars last year in its indirect trade with Taiwan province, 
while its trade deficit with Japan was 7.47 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The statistics also show that China enjoyed a favorable 
balance of trade with Hong Kong, the United States and Britain. 
  China's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the United States 
last year was 11.58 billion U.S. dollars and 6.27 billion U.S. 
dollars respectively.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
in meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen at 
Zhongnanhai's Purple Light Pavilion today, said China and the 
United States should seize the current opportunity and take 
practical steps, in order to push Sino-U.S. relations back onto

  Bentsen arrived here this afternoon for a four-day official

Zhongli. During Bentsen's visit, he and Liu Zhongli will 
cochair the eighth meeting of the Sino-U.S. joint economic

  Li, calling Bentsen "an important member of the U.S. cabinet 
and a senior statesman," said his visit will strongly promote 
the development of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  "From a realistic as well as a long-term perspective, a wide 
range of common interests exists between China and the United 
States, who should maintain a healthy and good relationship and 
enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields," Li said. 
  China and the United States should seize the opportunity 
created by the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and 
President Clinton last November, and do something in a practical 
and down-to-earth manner, so as to push Sino-U.S. relations back 
onto a normal track of development at an early date, Li said. 
  While differences exist between the two countries, this 
should not affect the expansion of bilateral ties, which has 
overall importance, and the differences should be handled 
through dialogue and consultations, Li said, noting that 
emphasis should be placed more on the common points. 
  As for differences in ideologies and concepts of values, the 
two countries should seek common ground while reserving 
differences, in the spirit of mutual respect, he added. 
  After a brief account of China's economic development, 
reform 
and opening-up, Li noted that China has a huge potential market 
and takes interest in American technology and equipment which 
are advanced in many fields. 
  With strongly complementary economies, the two countries 
will 
be able to greatly expand their economic and trade relations, he 
said. 
  Bentsen said that as he was dispatched by President Clinton 
on this visit, it showed the importance the U.S. Administration 
attaches to developing relations with China. Bentsen expressed 
the wish to seek ways to further U.S.-China ties, especially 
economic and trade ties, through the visit, according to a 
Chinese official. 
  As the biggest developed country and the biggest developing 
nation, the United States and China can cooperate in many 
fields, Bentsen said. 
  The U.S. Treasury secretary, who visited China in 1978, 
observed that the Chinese Government has done a lot to improve 
people's welfare. 
  The United States believes that a strong and prosperous 
China 
will do good to the United States and the world in general, the 
Chinese source quoted Bentsen as saying. 
  Also, Bentsen said that the Clinton administration "strongly 
feels" that the United States should be involved in the economic 
growth and development of Asia, particularly China. 
  Li, voicing agreement, said a strong and prosperous China 
will pose no threat to any country. "We only want to take good 
care of our 1.2 billion people and our land of 9.6 million 
square kilometers. We are constantly willing to contribute to 
world peace and development," he said. 
  Earlier this afternoon, Bentsen and Liu Zhongli had a 
30-minute meeting.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China and the United States yesterday reached a 
last- minute agreement on the textile trade thereby forestalling 
a major trade war which would have left Hong Kong caught in the 
middle. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by 
chief U.S. negotiator Jennifer Hillman and Chinese Deputy Trade 
Minister Shi Guangsheng, the United States agreed not to impose 
the quota reductions of up to 35 percent threatened two weeks 
ago, while China agreed to take strict measures to crack down on 
the illegal transshipment of textiles to the United States. 
  Mr Shi said both parties were "satisfied" with the agreement 
and had pledged to work closely together to ensure such disputes 
did not arise again. The agreement was in the interests of both 
China and the United States and would also be of considerable 
benefit to Hong Kong and Macau, he said. 
  Wu Yi, China's Foreign Trade Minister, hailed the agreement 
as a breakthrough after months of fruitless talks between 
Beijing and Washington. "The strengthening of our co-operation 
will not only help to strengthen our bilateral economic and 
trade relations but also promote peace and world development," 
Ms Wu told Ms Hillman before the pact was signed yesterday. "We 
should join hands on cracking down on middlemen and hope for 
close co-operation to implement the agreement," Ms Wu said. 
  Ms Hillman said she was also pleased to announce the 
agreement. 
  Under the U.S. trade system, textile trade is controlled by 
agreements that set export quotas for different kinds of cloth 
products. The United States claimed that China has exceeded its 
quota by US$2 billion (HK$15.5 billion) a year, mostly by 
shipping goods with fake labels through third countries. 
  In a briefing for the mainland and Hong Kong press after the 
signing ceremony, Mr Shi admitted that China had been using 
"fraudulent means" to violate the quotas established by the last 
Sino-American bilateral textile agreement. But he said such 
fraudulent and illegal activities damaged the interests of both 
countries and had led to "chaos in the market". 
  Although the United States has agreed not to impose drastic 
cuts on Chinese imports this year, China did agree to accept 
some quota reduction but no more than three times the amount of 
textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally 
trans-shipped. However, the exact quotas have apparently yet to 
be worked out. In addition to the trans-shipment issue, China 
also agreed to major adjustments of some categories of the 
textile quota proposed by the Americans. 
  MOU was only a prelude to a full bilateral textile 
agreement, 
Chinese trade officials said. But China has agreed on a key 
issue of trans-shipments of Chinese textiles to the United 
States via third countries. It will significantly step up its 
inspection of local and joint venture textile exporters to 
ensure that transshipments are controlled. China will 
rigorously enforce its own laws and regulations and severely 
punish those companies found to be engaging in illegal 
activities, Mr Shi said. Companies will have their export 
licences cancelled and in certain cases legal proceedings will 
be taken against the company managers and directors responsible. 
  China also agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing 
to accompany Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile 
factories on the mainland, providing the factories concerned 
agreed, Mr Shi said. The deputy trade minister said that both 
parties had made "great efforts" and each side had made 
compromises to ensure that an agreement was reached. 
  But while a tentative agreement has been reached, analysts 
said it would be several months before it could establish if 
China's promise to crack down on transshipments really was being 
implemented. "This is obviously an encouraging sign, but it 
remains to be seen if China can live up to the agreement," a 
Western diplomat in Beijing said. 
  Yesterday's agreement came just two days before U.S. 
Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's scheduled visit to China. Mr Bentsen 
will become the highest ranking Clinton administration official 
to visit China.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yu Cheng (6735 2052): "Sino-U.S. Trade Must </F>
Adhere to the Principle of Mutual Benefit"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--After 
going through several rounds of arduous talks, China and the 
United States finally reached a new agreement on textile goods. 
This agreement has undoubtedly given both China and the United 
States -- and even Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles 
-- a breathing spell and has also raised the hope that China's 
MFN trading status will be renewed for another year. Yet, the 
more important message conveyed by the agreement is that 
economic and trade exchanges should be carried out on the basis 
of the principle of mutual benefit; otherwise, both parties will 
suffer losses. 
  Over the past year and more, the United States has added a 
great number of non-economic factors to economic and trade 
dealings with China, thus creating many obstacles for industrial 
and commercial ties between the two countries. During its talks 
with China on a new textile agreement, the United States filed 
groundless charges against China's U.S.-bound textile exports 
and unilaterally imposed sanctions against China. As a result, 
the two sides were unable to reach a consensus before the 
deadline of the old agreement and have had to speed up the pace 
of their negotiations in order to enter a new one. It is beyond 
any doubt that the new agreement has served to eliminate one of 
the unclear factors currently exiting in Sino- U.S. trade, yet 
people are still closely following the issue of the United 
States' renewal of China's MFN trading status. 
  No matter whether it is under the newly reached Sino-U.S. 
textile agreement or when engaged in other bilateral economic 
and trade relations, China has always acted in accordance with 
the principle of mutual benefit. Over the past several years, 
in light of its own realistic conditions, China has done a great 
deal of work in opening the domestic market, reducing tariffs, 
protecting intellectual property rights, and even improving the 
human rights record. Yet, due to differences in social, 
historical, cultural, and economic backgrounds and conditions, 
it is obvious that foreign countries should not force their own 
standards on China or demand that China make impractical changes. 
  If the United States can renew or even change its improper 
practice of making an annual appraisal on China's MFN trading 
status, I believe that both countries will be able to enjoy 
considerable social and economic benefits. The reasonable 
prices and constantly improving quality of China's exported 
products favor to American consumers at the middle and lower 
social strata. On the other hand, American manufacturers and 
businessmen can also benefit from the normalization of Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade relations. A great number of American 
businessmen and even transnational enterprises have already set 
up factories and representative offices in China in an attempt 
to open up this huge market which has great potential. 
  China's demand for imports has grown rapidly over that of 
recent years. According to statistics released by the Chinese 
customs authority, the value of China's imports of all kinds of 
materials in 1993 totalled $103.9 billion, representing a 
29-percent increase over that of 1992. During the same period, 
however, export growth stood at only 9 percent; as a result, 
China's trade deficits have gone as high as $12.18 billion. 
  China's persistence in upholding the policy of reform and 
opening up and in speeding up the pace of economic development 
needs to be backed by investment in various types of capital and 
basic construction projects. Therefore, it can be predicted 
that China needs to import $700 billion worth of relevant 
materials in stages over the coming several years. This 
undoubtedly holds great appeal for foreign investors. China 
will nevertheless continue to carry out economic and trade 
exchanges with foreign countries in accordance with the 
time-tested principle and policies of mutual benefit and hopes 
that all its economic and trade partners can also show respect 
for this spirit. China apparently wishes to bring a continued 
favorable turn to its economic and trade relations with the 
United States, including to renewal of its MFN trading status. 
However, such a relationship needs to be a long-lasting one, not 
simply one that is extended annually.

  [Text] Washington, January 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher is going to meet with Chinese Vice 
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris on January 24, 
it was announced here today. 
  The State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told a 
regular new briefing that Christopher and Qian "will discuss a 
full range of issues, including international questions 
requiring joint cooperation and bilateral issues that affect our 
relations." Bilateral issues include "human rights, 
non-proliferation and trade," she added. 
  In answering questions, she confirmed that the State 
Department "reviewed earlier in the week about the specific 
connection of the human rights issue to MFN (most-favored-nation 
trade status)." 
  The Clinton administration's position on this issue, she 
said, is that there has been "some progress, but not the kind of 
progress that we're looking for in terms of conditions that have 
been set for a renewal of MFN.... There is still a long way to 
go." 
  The spokeswoman denied the reported divergence between the 
views of U.S. ambassador in China, Stapleton Roy, and 
administration's position on the human rights issue. 
  Ambassador Roy said in an interview published in the NEW 
YORK 
TIMES two weeks ago that China had made "dramatic" progress in 
improving the lives of its people and that this record should be 
taken into account when the U.S. policy toward China is reviewed 
in the new year. 
  Shelly noted that Roy's policy analysis, his policy 
recommendations to the administration "do carry particular 
weight." However, she argued that the ambassador's remarks and 
total interview "definitely should be taken as a whole." 
  During Christopher's trip to Paris, Shelly said, he will 
also 
discuss with French officials president Clinton's meetings in 
Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva and address "a wide range 
of subjects of mutual concern."

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251): "Chief of General Staff </F>
Zhang Wannian Says He Believes There Will Be More and More 
Exchanges Between the Chinese and U.S. Armed Forces in Future"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--General 
Zhang Wannian, chief of general staff of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army, said this morning at a meeting with Lieutenant 
General Paul Cerjan, president of the U.S. National Defense 
University, that he believes there will be more and more 
exchanges between the Chinese and U.S. Armed Forces in future. 
He said: "I have an optimistic attitude toward the prospects 
of exchanges between the Chinese and U.S. armed forces." 
  Zhang Wannian said: The relations between the Chinese and 
U.S. Armed Forces constitutes an important part of the relations 
between the two countries. Last year, U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of Defense Charles Freeman made the proposal to develop the 
relations between the two armed forces during his visit to China 
in November and the Chinese side expressed its appreciation of 
this. "I have a positive attitude toward the development of the 
relations between the Chinese and U.S. Armed Forces and our door 
is open." 
  Zhang Wannian held that the visit to China by Paul Cerjan 
and 
his party will certainly make an important contribution to the 
development of friendship between the Chinese and U.S. Armed 
Forces, particularly between the defense universities of the two 
countries. 
  General Zhang Wannian said China and the United States are 
two big countries which make an impact on the world. They have 
common interests but also have differences. This an objective 
fact. Either good or bad relations between China and the United 
States will have a great impact on the peace and stability of 
Asia and the world as a whole. Some differences between the two 
sides can be settled through mutual visits, conversations, and 
discussions between leaders of the two sides. 
  Zhang Wannian stressed that China pursues a national defense 
policy of positive defense. The fact that China develops some 
military equipment is entirely to meet the needs of defending 
our own country and will never threaten others. 
  General Zhang Wannian told the guests that the whole party, 
the whole armed forces, and all the people of China are 
wholeheartedly carrying out economic construction in accordance 
with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. China is full of confidence about attaining 
her strategic goals. 
  Paul Cerjan said that the United States supports China's 
modernization and supports a stable China because this is 
conducive to the peace and stability of the region and the world 
as a whole. 
  Lieutenant General Paul Cerjan said that U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman also held that his visit to 
China last year was a success and is looking forward to Deputy 
Chief of General Staff Xu Huizi's visit to the United States. 
  Paul Cerjan said that U.S. military are very interested in 
developing exchanges with the Chinese armed forces. Such 
exchanges have restarted at present and are hoped to become more 
and more in future. 
  Paul Cerjan and his party arrived in Beijing by invitation 
on 
15 January for an eight-day visit to China. This is the first 
U.S. military delegation to visit China since Charles Freeman's 
visit, assistant secretary of defense of the United States. 
  General Zhu Dunfa, president of the Chinese National Defense 
University, held talks with Paul Cerjan and hosted a banquet for 
him recently. Paul Cerjan and his party leave Beijing to visit 
Nanjing and Shanghai this afternoon.

complementary 
to each other, Li Peng said, adding that the prospects of 
Sino-Canadian cooperation is great. 
  During the meeting, Li Peng also briefed the visitors on the 
new developments of China's reform and opening-up process. 
  Mulroney said he was pleased to see the constant improvement 
of Canada-China ties and that bilateral trade was expanding year 
by year. He was optimistic about the prospects for Canada's 
ties with China. 
  China has made progress in every field, Mulroney said, 
adding 
that his country admires the courage of the Chinese leaders in 
carrying out reforms.

suburbs of Suifenhe city. This border free trading zone is 
designed by the Russian side. The Chinese side will organize 
forces to undertake the construction. Each side will offer 50 
percent of the construction funds. 
  This border free trading zone will start construction in 
April, and the main construction project will be completed at 
the end of September. 
  After the operation of the zone, both Chinese and Russian 
sides will individually set up their administrative organs. 
Those who enter this zone should have the effective 
certificates as approved by the border departments of both 
sides. Both ruble and renminbi can be used in the zone. 
Simultaneously, convertible currency activities are allowed in 
the zone. 
  To accelerate the construction of this zone, a committee in

  [Text] Moscow, January 11 (XINHUA) -- A senior Russian 
official today highlighted Russian-Chinese relations, saying 
that his country is seeking a balanced diplomatic policy toward 
the East and West. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told the ITAR-TASS 
NEWS AGENCY that China carries great weight in Russia's foreign 
policy and the two countries enjoy the broadest prospect for 
cooperation. 
  Panov, who is in charge of Asian and Pacific affairs, said 
that Russia has speeded up its efforts to develop a "wide 
partnership" with China in dealing with both bilateral and 
international relations following President Boris Yeltsin's 
historic visit to Beijing in December 1992. 
  The Russian-Chinese relationship should be as normal as one 
between two neighbors, the deputy foreign minister said, adding 
that the two countries should cooperate for their mutual 
interests and for peace in the region and the world as a whole. 
  He told the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY that Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit China at the end of January. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton's coming visit to Moscow and 
Kozyrev's trip to Beijing show that Russia is seeking a balanced 
diplomatic policy toward the East and West, he said. 
  Panov also spoke highly of China's economic reforms, saying 
that its experiences, especially those obtained in the special 
economic zones, will be helpful to Russia. 
  He said bilateral trade is mutually complementary and would 
grow steadily.

<F P=106> [Article by Song Wugang (1345 2745 0474): "Depth and </F>
Vitality of Theories--Studying Deng Xiaoping's Assertions on 
Literature and Art"] 
  [Text] Although the wording is very simple, with regard to 
"Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics" established and propagated by the 14th party 
congress, the contents cover a very wide scope with incisiveness 
and profundity. They cover many aspects, including running the 
state, party building, running the Army, the economy, culture, 
foreign affairs, and life in general. This article is going to 
deal with just a very small fraction of the theory, namely, the 
basic sources and characteristics of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on 
literature and art. 
  The primary origin of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature 
and art is Marxist and Mao Zedong thinking on literature and 
art. Based on historical materials, especially through the 
newly published work by Mao Mao, My Father, Deng 
Xiaoping, we learn that initially he only had schooling up 
to second year in junior high; nevertheless, this gifted high 
school student managed to cross the ocean and arrived in the 
motherland of the Paris Commune at the age of 16; later he went 
to Marx' motherland, and accepted Marxism through a part-work, 
part-study program. He was a famous "Maoist" when the Red Army 
was first founded. Although he was persecuted during the 
Cultural Revolution, he has always been firm in safeguarding Mao 
Zedong Thought in a series of speeches since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th Central Committee. This was an expression 
of his persistent loyalty as well as evidence of his profound 
friendship for a comrade-in-arms. In simple words and clear-cut 
views, the world outlook and methodology characterized by 
dialectical materialism and historical materialism run through 
many theses in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping; this also proves that he has a profound 
attainment and mastery of Marxism-Leninism. The second origin 
of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature and art was the positive 
and negative experiences of party leadership in literature and 
art work. If we put it that the party's work in literature and 
art was at an infant stage during the First Revolutionary Civil 
War, then, when Mao Zedong published his "Talks at the Yanan 
Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, the party's work in this 
arena had already matured. On many basic points, the "Talks" 
enriched the Marxist theoretical treasure house on literature 
and art. Deng Xiaoping's long-term revolutionary practice and 
his understanding of life in various directions has made the 
profundity of his thinking quite beyond the reach of ordinary 
men! The third origin of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature 
and art is information on the literature and art movement during 
the new historical period. What accounts for the ever- running 
waters of the mighty Chang Jiang is that it has its fountainhead 
in the Tuotuo River on the southern slope of Kala Kunlun Shan; 
furthermore, it accepts waters from a hundred tributaries in 
nine provinces at any one time. Comrade Xiaoping studied the 
original works of Marx and Lenin in his early years, and 
personally participated in the collective founding of Mao Zedong 
Thought; all this has increased the depth and vitality of his 
theory. 
  The major characteristics of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on 
literature and art are as follows: 
  First, combining theory with practice. This is the general 
and basic characteristic of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature 
and art. Just as Marx said: Any genuine philosophy is the 
quintessence of the spirit of one's times. The general 
characteristic of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art 
is precisely his meeting the need of the spirit of the times 
during the new historical period with originality, while 
adhering to the traditional principle of Marxist-Mao Zedong 
thinking on literature and art and fitting the situation of 
reform and opening up. We can find this by reading his 
programmatic document, "Speech Greeting the Fourth Congress of 
Chinese Writers and Artists." In addition, because Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has its origin in 
reality and practicality in combining theory with practice, it 
was made entirely concrete in party policy on literature and 
art. Those people who are familiar with the PRC history of 
literature and art should be able to see the brilliance of this 
characteristic: First, literature and art should convert from a 
situation of taking class struggle as the key to a situation 
mainly characterized by economic construction, peace, and 
development; second, expanding the scope of to whom literature 
and art renders service to all people, including the 
intelligentsia and other people on the broadest scale; third, 
making important readjustments that fall in line with the 
characteristics of the new period concerning the contents of 
service, with many forbidden areas broken through, while 
stressing "what subjects they should choose for their creative 
work and how they should deal with those subjects are questions 
that writers and artists themselves must examine and gradually 
resolve through practice. There should be no arbitrary meddling 
in this process"; and fourth, improving and enriching forms of 
service, which everyone can see.... In the concluding part of 
the "Speech Greeting the Fourth Congress of Chinese Writers and 
Artists," Deng Xiaoping said with full confidence: "The 
conditions are ripening daily that will enable us genuinely to 
put into practice the Marxist policy of "let a hundred flowers 
bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend." In a nutshell, 
Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has developed on 
the solid foundation of inheriting Marxist-Mao Zedong thinking 
on literature and art, while linking it to the new realities of 
literature and art in China, and calling forth ideological 
vitality in the combination of theory and practice. Regarding 
this point, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Beyond a doubt, 
we should never for a moment violate the fundamental principle 
of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. However, it is 
imperative to link, analyze, and study actual conditions as well 
as to resolve practical issues." "It is necessary to link 
Marxist universal truth to the specific realities of China, take 
our own road, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics; 
that is precisely the basic conclusion drawn from summarizing 
our long-term historical experiences." 
  Second, the combination of freedom in creation and 
scientific 
value. This finds expression in the whole process of the 
production of literature and art, and is another characteristic 
of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art. 
  Regarding literature and art undertakings, just as Lenin 
stressed that "it is absolutely imperative to insure a vast 
space for the individual's creativity and interest...," our 
party has all along advocated the free development of different 
forms and styles in artistic creation. Of course, it is 
unnecessary to conceal the fact that in a specific wartime 
environment, literary and artistic creation aimed at clearly 
propagating a certain policy and specific political tasks at a 
specific time did exist for a long time and played a certain 
role; however, viewed from a long-range artistic angle, its role 
in the development of the production of literature and art, 
especially quality improvement, was very limited. 
  That being the case, Deng Xiaoping stressed: "The road 
before literature and art should become broader and broader" 
"writers and artists should deal with an ever wider range of 
themes, increasingly vary their means of expression, and dare to 
blaze new trails." "We must guard against or overcome the 
tendency to be formalistic and abstract, which produces 
monotonous, stiff, mechanical and stereotyped works." We may 
put it that Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has 
pushed the creative freedom of writers and artists to an 
unprecedentedly higher plane. 
  The scientific value of such administrative ways lies in the 
fact that it has macroscopic control while paying attention to 
microscopic readjustment, and it is capable of exercising 
discipline on others as well as self-discipline; furthermore, it 
is characterized by its practical value. 
  Summing up, first, regarding the producers of literature and 
art, namely, writers and artists themselves, he set out the need 
to "conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to 
enhance their own ability to understand and analyze life and see 
through appearances to the essence," and "to become real 
engineers of the human soul." Second, he set out the need to 
improve leadership in party organizations in work concerning 
literature and art. And third, he set out the need to augment 
leadership in this scene. 
  The scientific guidance of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on 
literature and art makes its profundity and accuracy keenly felt 
on any ordinary day, especially at the critical moment of a 
sudden change in the situation when right and wrong are being 
confused. This has definitely been proven by the newly 
published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping.

"Life Makes the Tree of Literature and Art Evergreen--Studying 
Mao Zedong's Assertions on How Life Is Related to Literature and 
Art"] 
  [Text] An important contribution Mao Zedong made to 
Marxist theory on literature and art lies in his applying the 
theory of reflection in dialectical materialism to resolving the 
relationship between literature and art on the one hand, and 
life on the other, the fundamental issue in literary and art 
creation; he regarded the theory of reflection in dialectical 
materialism as the theoretical basis for resolving the 
relationship between literature, art, and life. The theory of 
reflection in dialectical materialism falls into the category of 
the Marxist theory of cognition, of which Marx, Engels and Lenin 
all offered explicit and full discussions; however, it was Mao 
Zedong who was most thorough in applying it to the arenas of 
literature, art, and aesthetic theory. He was certain that life 
"provides literature and art with an inexhaustible source, their 
only source. Life is the only source, for there can be no 
other." That was the view of a firm and thorough materialist. 
In the history of Marxist thinking on literature and art, no 
one before Mao Zedong had applied the Marxist, materialist 
theory of cognition and made such profound, scientific 
assertions and explicit explanation on the relationship between 
literature, art, and life as he did. However, Mao Zedong was 
simultaneously a great dialectician, while ascertaining that 
life was of a primary nature, and literature and art of a 
secondary nature, he fully expounded that literature and art 
could and ought to be "on a higher plane, more intense, more 
concentrated, more typical, nearer the ideal, and therefore more 
universal than actual everyday life." That was also the 
offspring of Mao Zedong combining Marxist theory with social 
practice in China as well as practice in literature and art. 
Some people groundlessly regarded the Marxist theory of 
reflection and its application to literature and art as the 
"theory of reflection through direct perception of the senses." 
We have only to read relevant works by Mao Zedong himself to 
find out that he was very certain about the truth that life was 
the only source of literature and art, a materialist concept 
that could never be shaken; furthermore, he fully affirmed the 
dynamic role of literature and art in life, and the subjective 
aspect of the writer in literary creation. Those people who 
regard the theory of reflection, and its application to matters 
of literature and art, as the theory of reflection through 
direct perception of the senses which is a negation of the 
subjective aspect deliberately distort the Marxist theory of 
reflection, or at least lack genuine understanding of the 
Marxist concept on this issue. 
  In the past, writers and artists who did not entirely 
neglect 
life could see consciously, or at least through practice, that 
literary and artistic creation could not be independent of life. 
For example, Chinese painters who specialized in the genre of 
portraying nature did not directly express social life, but the 
majority of them saw the importance of "learning from nature"; 
otherwise, they could not really have any true artistic 
accomplishments in portraying nature. There were cases of 
following in the footsteps of ancient artists; however, those 
painters who failed to pay attention to observing nature but 
simply followed in the footsteps of ancient artists, and did not 
see nature as the inspiration for their own creation would 
inevitably create only impoverished works, and their works could 
not have genuine artistic life. 
  We naturally cannot rest satisfied with the simple 
materialist understanding of ancient writers and artists in the 
relationship between art and life. Every person who believes in 
historical materialism acknowledges that history was a creation 
of the people, and history was mainly the producers' history. 
When Mao Zedong set forth the proposition that our literature 
and art reflect the life of the people, his view was by no means 
without foundation; it was just the true face of history. If 
our literature is truthful, and falls in line with the true face 
of history, we can only place the truthful reflection of the 
people's life above all else. It cannot be otherwise, 
especially when history has developed to an era of the people's 
revolution under proletarian leadership. 
  In past Chinese literature, there were many works that 
portrayed the life and suffering of the working people in 
poetry; but in novels, such works were few aside from "Outlaws 
of the Marsh." Lu Xun shared that view. Aside from the "Book 
of Odes" and much folklore in its wake, the poet Bai Juyi wrote 
many works reflecting the people's sufferings; however, he could 
not avoid looking down at the impoverished with sympathy and 
pity typical of the literati and officialdom in feudal China; 
literary works in this category can be said to have an "affinity 
to the people." Furthermore, not only works that give a direct 
portrayal of life at the lowest depth have an "affinity to the 
people." This issue should not be grasped in a simple and 
narrow view. But in the history of Chinese literature, it was 
none other than Lu Xun who was the first to genuinely portray 
images of peasants, such as sister-in-law Xianglin and Runtu, 
who were genuine Chinese peasants, not those in the eyes of past 
literati and officialdom in feudal China. But even Lu Xun 
mainly succeeded in portraying the sufferings of the oppressed 
peasants; in that aspect, he was extraordinarily profound and 
truthful. The peasants of Lu Xun's pen were mainly of the 
suffering class, they had not yet awakened, and were not a 
revolutionary class. Mao Zedong explicitly set out the need for 
literature and art to depict the new mass era, and the new life 
of workers, peasants, and soldiers; that should be viewed as an 
important revolution in literary and artistic thinking. 
  In the era of the people's revolution, especially in an era 
when the masses have already grasped political power and become 
masters of the country, literature and art must appear in new 
features if they are not to be divorced from life, peasants, 
workers, and the army. 
  It was precisely because of this that Mao Zedong's call that 
"China's revolutionary writers and artists, writers and artists 
of promise, must go among the masses; they must for a long 
period of time unreservedly and wholeheartedly go among the 
masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, go into the heat of 
struggle, to the only source, the broadest and richest 
source...." was not just a periodic need, not just a "war-time 
policy for literature and art," as some people put it, or only 
applicable to past rural environment, but the party basic line 
for literature and art, which is grounded on Marxist basic 
tenets. In the 50 years since the publication of "Talks at the 
Yanan Forum on Literature and Art," the great accomplishments in 
Chinese revolutionary literature and art are the victory of the 
party basic line for literature and art as well as Marxism. 
  Of course, we should always bear in mind that the reflection 
we refer to in the arena of literature and art is aesthetic 
reflection, and a particular way of grasping the world. Every 
step taken in this arena contains expressions of the unique 
imagination, feelings, and sentiments pertaining of the writer 
himself. In this arena , it is utterly impossible to implement 
compulsion and to achieve mechanical balance with other 
ideological arenas; freedom of creation to the maximum must be 
insured on the basis of a common revolutionary orientation and 
thinking. That was a point Lenin did not forget even when he 
stressed that literature must adhere to the principle of party 
spirit, with clear and explicit affirmation. On the issue of 
literary and artistic creation, Mao Zedong set out the principle 
of letting a hundred flowers bloom, which precisely contained 
the same thinking as Lenin's. While adhering to the ideological 
universality of literature and art in the past, the neglect of 
the particularity of literature and art was an important 
ideological root cause of "leftist" dogmatic errors. Such 
"leftist" dogmatic thinking had negative effects on normal 
development in creation. Under the prerequisite of opposing 
bourgeois liberalization and adhering to the correct ideological 
and political orientation, it is necessary to continue to weed 
out such "leftist" dogmatic thinking. 
  Proceeding from this understanding, what enables us to 
correctly resolve the issue of reflecting people's life is 
primarily to reflect the life of workers, peasants, 
revolutionary armymen, and revolutionary intellectuals. On this 
issue of the relationship between the requirements history has 
bestowed on literature and art and "self-expression" of writers 
and artists, the belief that literature and art should be and 
mainly is "self expression" was comparatively popular a few 
years back, with comparatively strong voices. In fact, all 
spiritual products are stamped with the producers themselves, 
namely, the "self" expression of the producers. It is the more 
so with artistic production. Artistic products always bear 
sharper particular personal experiences, feelings and sentiments 
than other spiritual products. The reason art cannot be 
repeated probably lies here in the main. Even with the same 
subject matter, in works portraying the same hero, even by the 
same author, it can hardly be a complete repetition. It is so 
with the writer's literary creations, the composer's musical 
pieces, the painter's artistic works, and the playwright's 
scripts; it is so with the performing artist, too. An actor 
worthy of the name of an artist, or a fine, outstanding 
conductor of an orchestra, even when he was playing the same 
role or the same piece of music over and over, will offer new 
variations and new creations every time; that was a fact that 
the majority of the audiences already knew. We cannot generally 
oppose "self expression," the question is what sort of "self." 
Any writer of whatever class has his own "self," and will 
inevitably express his own "self"; the "self expression" of a 
writer taking the people's position naturally shares the 
people's feelings and sentiments; have we not come into contact 
with many good lyric poems and songs? A poet or a composer who 
takes the people's position, and shares the thinking and 
emotions with the people, when he gives expression to his 
personal feeling is giving expression to the popular feeling at 
the same time. In fact, many of Mao Zedong' poems are 
"self-expressive," or expressing the "self" at the same time; 
has this not most satisfactorily explained this issue? We do 
not approve of and oppose only the "self expression" that is 
divorced from the people and even stands in opposition to the 
people. There were actually quite a few of works of "self 
expression" in this category sometimes in the past. Such "self 
expression" can in no way express the essential things of life.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
leader, Hu jintao, stressed here today the importance of 
correctly handling the relations between reform, development and 
stability. 
  He was addressing a graduation ceremony of the Central 
School 
of the Communist Party of China (CPC). 
  Hu said that during the process of building a socialist 
market economy, it was necessary on the one hand to carry 
forward the spirit of advancing despite difficulties and working 
with perseverance to firmly push forward the reform, and on the 
other hand to adopt a rigorous scientific approach, proceed from 
actual conditions and discover and solve major problems in time 
on the way forward. 
  Hu Jintao, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, member of the 
Secretariat of the Central Committee and president of the 
Central Party School, told 1,964 people attending the ceremony 
at the school that 1994 is a critical year for the process of 
China's reform and development. 
  He emphasized that to maintain a quick and healthy 
development of the national economy, ensure a smooth 
implementation of all the reform measures and maintain political 
stability is a major problem for the whole party, which 
especially leading officials at various levels must pay close 
attention to and make all efforts to solve. 
  Hu reiterated that it is imperative to strengthen 
ideological 
and political work during the reform process. 
  He called on officials at various levels to carry forward 
the 
party's fine tradition and work style, to immerse themselves 
among the masses, mobilize the masses to support and take part 
in the reform.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486) and Xia Ruge </F>
(1115 0320 7041)] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 10 Jan (XINHUA) -- As we are currently in 
a crucial stage when a series of major reform measures are being 
introduced, we must meticulously organize and work hard together 
to ensure the smooth implementation of these measures. This is 
what Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, repeatedly 
stressed while inspecting Zhejiang and Shanghai recently. 
  He pointed out: The introduction of a series of major 
economic reform measures this year is an important step in 
advancing toward the goals of establishing the socialist market 
economic system determined by the 14th CPC National Congress. 
Now we must pay particular attention to social stability, keep 
commodity prices down, do a further good job in the tasks of 
fighting corruption and promoting clean administration, and 
control the size of fixed asset investment to minimize risks so 
as to create a good external environment for accelerating reform. 
  During his inspection, Li Lanqing highly praised the 
development of Zhejiang and Shanghai. He pointed out: 
Shanghai's reform and opening up bears strategic significance 
for the nation. The municipality has not failed to live up to 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great expectations, and has made 
encouraging achievements in economic development, market 
establishment, Pudong's development, opening up to the outside 
world, and foreign economy and trade. It has truly achieved the 
goal of making changes every year. Zhejiang's overall situation 
is very good, and the province has made notable progress and 
development in various fields. In particular, it has made 
outstanding achievements in foreign economy and trade, the 
growth margin of which has topped the nation. There is great 
hope for Zhejiang to realize the goal of achieving a better 
living standard for the people ahead of time. 
  Li Lanqing heard work reports from provincial and municipal 
leaders from Zhejiang and Shanghai, and conducted on-the-spot 
inspection in plants, schools, and markets. He held discussions 
with the people and heard opinions from all sides on grain and 
oil prices, market supply, educational reform, foreign economic 
and trade development, and anti-smuggling efforts. 
  He stated: When introducing new comprehensive reform 
measures, we must pay particular attention to the inflation 
problem and keep prices within the limit bearable to the broad 
masses. The margin of fluctuation in grain and oil prices was 
previously rather large. The State Council has adopted some 
measures to tackle this problem, and localities should also 
sacrifice a little of their immediate and partial interests. 
They should apply macroeconomic control and regulation methods 
to quickly bring commodity prices which closely affect the 
people's life down to a reasonable level. Meanwhile, it is 
crucial to develop agriculture and to continue to effectively 
implement the "vegetable basket" and "grain bag" projects to 
ensure sufficient total supply of agricultural products. As 
long as there is an abundant supply of agricultural sideline 
products there will be no panic, and our tasks in implementing 
the measures will be made easier. 
  Li Lanqing asked Shanghai and Zhejiang, the two most forward 
regions in our country's opening up to the outside world, to 
make new contributions in using foreign funds as well as in 
developing domestic and foreign trade. He said: It is 
currently necessary to focus on the study of changing 
operational methods and operating mechanisms as well as 
enhancing the cohesive power of foreign trade enterprises. In 
addition, enterprises should establish the incentive and 
self-control mechanisms as well as carry out earnest experiments 
in modern enterprise systems to boost more foreign exchange 
earnings and upgrade economic efficiency. Enterprise system 
reform should be standardized and should proceed in accordance 
with relevant state stipulations to prevent losses in state 
assets. State-owned businesses and enterprises should be 
developed along the line of establishing chain commercial 
organizations which combine group operations and retailing. 
They should utilize foreign capital and adopt various ways for 
key development by combining actual local conditions. For 
example, Shanghai should focus on attracting investment from 
transnational corporations, introducing new and high technology 
industries, as well as adopting advanced operations and 
management methods to raise the quality and level of foreign 
capital utilization. In utilizing foreign capital, all 
localities should attach importance to improving investment 
environment, and should not blindly establish development zones. 
Efforts should be made to link the construction of approved 
development zones with the restructuring of old cities and old 
enterprises. 
  Educational work is an important aspect of Li Lanqing's 
inspection. He successively visited several institutes of 
higher learning, vocational schools, secondary schools, and 
elementary schools in Zhejiang and Shanghai, as well as held 
discussion meetings with leading comrades of institutes of 
higher learning in Hangzhou and Shanghai. After hearing the 
opinions of teachers and staff, he stressed: It is necessary to 
truly enhance the understanding in the issue of "respect for 
teachers and importance of education." He said: Comrade 
Xiaoping has attached great importance to educational work, and 
discussed it rather comprehensively and thoroughly in as many as 
27 chapters in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. We should earnestly study, understand, and 
practice his advocation. The saying "education is fundamental 
for a program of lasting importance" should not be taken as 
merely an empty slogan, but should be used for mobilizing the 
entire party, society, and people to show concern, support, and 
participate in promoting educational reform and development. 
Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his appreciation to Zhejiang 
provincial party committee for its promise not to delay payment 
of teachers' salaries. Zhejiang has specified that counties and 
cities that owe teachers' salaries will not be permitted to 
construct school buildings and purchase small automobiles, or 
even send personnel abroad, or pay salaries with advance from 
provincial funds to be deducted later from monies payable to 
them. Li Lanqing also expressed his appreciation to Ningbo City 
for its plan to solve teachers' housing problems. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: Further upgrading teaching quality 
and school efficiency are the two key issues in current reform 
for higher education. Apart from these, while implementing 
educational reform, we should ask the people not to merely seek 
a higher college entrance rate and advise students not to 
confine themselves to the difficult path of seeking entrance to 
college. We should vigorously develop vocational education and 
adult education to enable more people exploit their skills 
through various channels and contribute to society. He hoped 
that Shanghai and Zhejiang would actively explore new ways to 
vigorously develop vocational education. He fully affirmed 
attempts by Shanghai's institutes of higher learning in 
educational reform. He specially praised concerned schools for 
making full use of social resources in joint educational 
undertakings and in upgrading school efficiency. As for the 
issue of some institutes of higher learning seeking to be placed 
on the "211" project, Li Lanqing asked them not to rush into 
making an evaluation as the placement is a development process. 
Apart from standards stipulated by the State Education 
Commission, institutes of higher learning should meet the 
following three criteria: first, institutes of higher learning 
of provinces (cities) that have not implemented basic education 
efficiently cannot be placed on the "211" project. Second, 
institutes of higher learning that have not undertaken major 
reform measures cannot be placed on the "211" project. Third, 
institutes of higher education should supplement one another 
with their strengths and jointly establish the "211" project. 
  While inspecting local customs departments in Shanghai and 
Hangzhou, Li Lanqing pointed out: Anti-smuggling is a long-term 
struggle, aimed at improving the investment environment, which 
we should earnestly address. He said: The party committees and 
governments of Zhejiang and Shanghai should be commended for 
their strong support for attaching great importance to cracking 
down on smuggling. Although the vicious waves of nationwide 
smuggling crimes have been curbed, we should not lower our guard 
and should continue to realize the importance of anti-smuggling 
struggle. We should tighten our investigation and prosecution 
of major smuggling cases, as well as comprehensively implement 
the principle of curbing and penalizing smuggling crimes on sea, 
at coastal ports, on highways, and in markets. We should make 
overall plans to snatch repeated victories in anti-smuggling 
struggle before the Spring Festival.

  [Text] Guiyang, January 16 (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, a senior 
Chinese party and government leader, has called on the people in 
landlocked provinces such as Guizhou in southwest China to 
further emancipate the mind and more boldly embark on a road 
towards prosperity. 
  Li, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee, State Councillor and minister in charge of 
the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, made the 
call during his four-day inspection tour of Guizhou Province 
which ended Saturday [15 January]. 
  During his stay in Guizhou Province, Li visited factories, 
villages, granaries and development zones in the cities of 
Zunyi, Anshun and Guiyang. He appreciated the achievements the 
province has made since 1978, noting that the province's total 
industrial and agricultural output value had been doubled by 
1987 and is expected to be quadrupled by 1996. 
  He pointed out that although inland provinces are different 
from coastal areas in geographical conditions, natural 
conditions and the speed of economic development, they should 
not lag behind in emancipating the mind. Once the people's 
minds are emancipated, they will be able to shake off yokes, 
incorporate and use experience of developed regions, and 
fundamentally reform the old system that bound productive 
forces, in order to promote local economic development. 
  He called on inland provinces to seize the current 
opportunity, bring their advantages into full play, deepen the 
reform, open themselves wider to the outside world, and 
accelerate their economic development. 
  On reform of the administrative system for grain, Li 
stressed 
that it is necessary both to pay close attention to and be 
cautious in the reform of the system. At present, he added, it 
is important to make all efforts to stabilize grain prices and 
to make concerted efforts to ensure a bumper harvest in 1994.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- Luo Gan, State Councillor 
and deputy secretary of the Commission on Politics and Law under 
the CPC Central Committee, pointed out today at the national 
conference of the heads of justice departments (bureaus) the 
need to give full play to the functions and role of judicial and 
administrative work, to vigorously enhance the 
reform-through-labor and education- through-labor work, and to 
strive to create an excellent social environment for a stable 
social order and for reducing contradictions among the people. 
  Luo Gan pointed out that judicial and administrative work 
constitutes an important part of the building of a legal system, 
which assumes a heavy task of legal guarantees and legal 
services in developing a socialist market economy. The more the 
reform is carried out in depth and the more the economy 
develops, the more we need an enduring and stable social 
environment and the environment of a sound legal system, and the 
more we need to greatly strengthen the work of legal guarantees 
and legal services. 
  Luo Gan particularly stressed that since the implementation 
of the policy of reform and opening, the work of 
reform-through-labor and of education-through-labor has made new 
progress and achieved marked results although it has also met 
with some new conditions and new problems. To increase the 
quality of labor-through-reform and education-through-reform 
organs for reforming criminals and personnel undergoing 
education-through-labor, to prevent and reduce crime, and to 
ensure the enduring stability of the state, it is necessary to 
step up supervision over the reform work of reform- 
through-labor and to gradually establish modern and civilized 
prisons and a system for education-through-labor. 
  Since last year, various levels of judicial and 
administrative organs have stepped up the pace of reforming the 
work of legal services and have voluntarily and actively 
provided services regarding economic work. Particularly worth 
noting is the new progress made in reforming the lawyer system. 
Last year the nation saw the establishment of 824 new law 
offices, of which 199 were law offices established without the 
state's financing. The total number of law offices in the 
nation has reached 4,900. With the increase of 20,000 new 
lawyers, the total number of lawyers has reached nearly 70,000. 
The number of cases in which lawyers were asked to serve as 
legal advisers for government organs, institutions, business 
units, social organizations, and citizens, and cases in which 
lawyers were asked to serve as the criminal defense lawyer and 
in civil and business suits has increased by more than 10 
percent compared to the previous year. 
  In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang called on all 
levels of judicial and administrative organs to accelerate the 
pace of reform in the new year; to do a good job in building 
modern and civilized prisons and institutions of 
reform-through-labor; to continue deepening reform in the 
various aspects of judicial and administrative work; to do even 
better work in legal guarantees and legal services; and to 
promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. 
  Xiao Yang pointed out that prison is not only an organ for 
punishing criminals but also an organ for reforming criminals. 
He added that prison is also a special school for educating 
criminals. The purpose of reform-through-labor and of 
education-through-reform is not only to reform criminals and 
personnel undergoing education- through-labor into independent 
laborers who work honestly and who abide by the law, but also to 
reform them into capable persons who are adapted to the 
development of a socialist market economy. To that end, it is 
necessary to gradually establish a socialist prison and 
reform-through-labor system with Chinese characteristics. He 
said that the goal of reform-through-labor and of 
education-through- labor for some time in the future is to build 
prisons and reform- through-labor institutions into modern and 
civilized prisons and reform-through-labor institutions in a 
steadfast and within-our- means manner. 
  Xiao Yang also called for enhancing work to resettle, 
assist, 
and teach those personnel who have been released from prison 
after serving their sentences and those personnel who have been 
released from reform-through-labor institutions. He pointed out 
that doing a good job in this area will have the important 
effect of reducing recidivism, of maintaining social stability, 
and of safeguarding the development of a socialist market 
economy.

<F P=106> [By Tang Ling (0781 5480): "CPC To Deal With Hijacking With </F>
Violence"] 
  [Text] Successful Hijacking With Two Packages of 
Cigarettes 
  Nine cases of hijacking have taken place in the same sky and 
same place within a year (this article was written on 14 
December 1993.) This figure can go down in the world history of 
civil aviation and deserves an entry in the "Guiness Book of 
World Records." 
  It is true that hijacking from the China mainland to Taiwan 
could well be described as "easier than asking for a fire." 
Take, for instance, the hijacking that took place on 13 
December. Qi Daquan from Harbin made use of two packages of 
cigarettes in his pocket by saying that they were a "bomb remote 
control"; should the plane fail to follow orders to be go to 
Taiwan, he would activate the bombs. Thus did two packages of 
cigarettes succeed in hijacking a passenger plane. 
  In the wake of the hijacking, Taiwan public opinion 
unanimously lashed out at the CPC for harping on the same old 
tune of "repatriating both the hijacker and the aircraft" while 
deliberately implementing blockade on news concerning hijacking 
with the aim of blinding people on the China mainland to the 
conditions of handling hijackers in Taiwan; such practices have 
helped the frequent repetition of hijacking incidents. However, 
Taiwan media neglected the following signal: In his action, Qi 
Daquan fought with the crew on the aircraft who had attempted to 
halt the hijacking. Only his "realistic performance" in 
expressing his intention to activate the bombs gained him 
control over the situation. 
  In several past hijacking incidents, the crew would act 
according to the principle central instruction, namely, "they 
may decide on their own how to handle such incidents according 
to the conditions of the hijacking," and headed for Taiwan based 
on the hijackers' instruction. That was the result of changing 
past foolish practice demanding the crew to "fight heroically", 
which consequently led to the tragic crash of the hijacked 
plane at Baiyun Airport a year or two before. 
<H5>  The Central Authorities Have Already Revised Their Principle </H5>
  Nevertheless, with the high incidence of hijacking cases, 
the 
central authorities have negated what was once negated, revised 
their "principle," and issued the instruction that emergency 
measures can be adopted to halt hijacking "according to the 
actual conditions of the scene." 
  That was a decision made by the State Council at a meeting 
for such departments as civil aviation, public security, armed 
police corps, and customs on 15 November. At that meeting, Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua presided, and the participants made the 
initial decision on how to increase checks and security of 
airports and aircraft, adopted the resolution "On Augmenting 
Safety and Security of Airports and Aircraft," and proposed a 
series of new measures as follows: 
<H3>  The New Measures Stress "Taking Emergency Measures on the 
Scene" </H3>
  1. Be strict in checking passenger identification 
certificates according to rules, regulations and institutions, 
implement repeated checking on luggage, and there must be some 
restrictions on hand- carried luggage. 
  2. Separation of security work and an on-the-job 
responsibility system should be strictly implemented in the 
waiting room (or lounge), parking apron, and hangar. 
  3. The number of security men accompanying the aircraft 
should be increased. 
  4. In the wake of hijacking, or an attempt to sabotage the 
aircraft's safety, the security men, captain, head of the crew 
service group make take emergency measure to promptly halt such 
attempts under the condition of insuring passenger safety. And, 
  5. A comprehensive check of conditions in implementing 
safety measures of civil aviation airports across the country 
would be conducted in November; takeoffs and landings would be 
immediately suspended in those airports operating against rules 
and regulations. Safety examination work would be implemented by 
an institution of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. 
<H5>  To Stop Hijacking With Violence </H5>
  The new measures have authorized security men to "take 
emergency measures according to the actual conditions at the 
scene"; does this spell that violence can be taken against 
hijackers in flight? In the course of hijacking, the aforesaid 
Qi Daquan demanded that the crew leader open the door to the 
pilot's compartment; when his demand was rejected, Qi Daquan 
kicked and banged on the door with all his might; simply his 
bulging pockets, which the crew members believed containing 
bombs, halted the crew from taking "emergency measures"; 
otherwise, a disaster might take place any minute should a fight 
take place on an airborne craft. 
  According to some classified materials from the Civil 
Aviation Administration and public security departments, several 
attempted hijackings have occurred since implementation of the 
new measures; the hijackers did not succeed simply because 
security men on the aircraft had resolutely resorted to violence. 
  Some materials which the authorities did not publish are as 
follows: 
  On the morning of 17 November, a passenger on a 
Guiyang-bound 
plane that took off from Guangzhou pulled a knife from one of 
his boots 15 minutes after takeoff and burst into the pilot's 
compartment, but was tripped by a security man on the plane and 
subdued. The hijacker was a staffer from Zunyi City Materials 
Administration and a demobilized ex-serviceman who was sentenced 
to one year's imprisonment for hoodlum behavior in early 1989. 
  On the morning of 22 November, a Beijing-bound passenger 
plane that took off from Shanghai was over the sky above Nanjing 
when a passenger passed a note to the stewardess demanding that 
the plane head for ROK, saying that he carried a powerful bomb. 
When the security man took the hijacker to negotiate with the 
captain, he attacked the hijacker when the latter was not on 
guard and rendered him unconscious; then an emergency landing 
was conducted. The hijacker was an individual householder from 
Wenzhou. 
  On 26 November, a Guangzhou-bound passenger plane from 
Changzhou received an anonymous telephone call saying that an 
explosion would take place on the plane upon its arrival in 
Guangzhou and that the explosives were placed inside a milk 
powder can. When the relevant department received the report, 
it gave instruction to the plane to conduct an emergency landing 
in Hangzhou; there the armed forces, police, and expert searched 
the plane; a milk power can was found, but only some industrial 
chemical dyestuff was contained in it. 
  After takeoff on a Jinan-bound passenger plane from Shenzhen 
on the afternoon of 30 November, a stewardess was distributing 
drinks when a passenger walked into the pilot's compartment, 
saying that a time-bomb was concealed in a cake, which he was 
carrying with him, and demanded that the plane head for Taipei; 
he pointed at the crew leader and captain with some hard object 
which he asserted was a gun in the shape of a fountain pen. At 
this crucial moment, the public security man punched him down 
with a heavy blow. The hijacker was a retired security man from 
Qingdao. 
  A Shenzhen-bound chartered plane from Shenyang carried a 
delegation from 12 departments organized by Liaoning provincial 
authorities to visit Shenzhen and Zhuhai and conduct 
professional talks. The plane made an emergency landing in 
Tianjing, for two men accompanying the delegation from the 
foodstuff trade suddenly gave orders for the plane to head for 
Taiwan, while announcing that they were "seeking refuge with 
freedom," and threatened that they would blow up the plane if 
they found the flight path to be incorrect, then every one on 
the whole plane would perish together. In the chaos, the 
security men on the plane jumped the two hijackers, whereas the 
captain called on the passengers to subdue the hijackers in 
joint efforts. For a while, the plane lost control in the 
course of fight, and it was shaking. News from the scene said 
that one of the hijackers was shot dead by the security man with 
a pistol with a silencer. 
<H5>  Under News Blockade, People Flinch From Taking the Plane </H5>
  Later, the CPC related department gave instructions in early 
December, regarding coverage of attempted hijacking incidents, 
namely, it should be reported to higher authorities for 
examination and approval; attention should be paid to social 
impact to avoid negative effects on the reputation of civil 
aviation and passengers' sense of security. 
  That has roused people's anxieties. In the past, airline 
tickets were in short supply on the mainland and were very hard 
to get without going through the back door, and travel by plane 
was a symbol of one's social status. However, by November and 
December, namely, when hijacking incidents were frequent, the 
number of passengers on the eight major domestic civil aviation 
air routes dropped between 15 and 30 percent, which was a rare 
phenomenon in recent years. At the same time, soft-seat train 
tickets became the most sought-after, and even with increased 
cars related departments have failed to meet the demand; 
soft-seat sleeper tickets on the Beijing-Guangzhou, 
Beijing-Shanghai, Guangzhou-Fujian, and Shanghai- Chongqing 
lines were the most difficult to get. In addition, another 
interesting phenomenon was that during that period, the majority 
of cadres at office and bureau levels would take soft-seat 
sleeper trains on errand instead of travelling by plane.

<F P=106> [Article by Shen Chen (3088 2182): "Central Authorities </F>
Send Work Teams To Overhaul and Consolidate the Public Security 
Organs"] 
  [Text] NPC [National People's Congress] Standing 
Committee Members Submit a Letter Urging the Dismissal of Tao 
Siju 
  On 29 October 1993, a breezy fall day, former Huizhou Public 
Security Bureau Head Hong Yonglin was sent to the execution 
grounds. Before that this "bully," who had been insufferably 
arrogant in the past, already knew that he had become a target 
in the anticorruption drive and that he could hardly escape. 
Before he met his fate, however, there were two regrettable 
things: First, he did not have time to enjoy his three bottles 
of Louis XIII (each bottle of this wine is worth 6,700 yuan). 
Second, he never got to stay in a presidential suite at 
Guangzhou's White Swan Hotel. He would have spent several 
thousand yuan enjoying it had he had the opportunity.... 
  Hong Yonglin departed for another world with too many 
"regrets," but his execution has left room for reflection, 
because he was not the "black sheep" that the CPC propaganda 
machine described him to be, but the epitome of corruption and 
degeneration in the whole body of public security organs. 
  Corruption in the public security organs has not only 
aroused 
the people's call for overhauling them but also drawn the 
attention of the senior CPC authorities to the seriousness of 
the matter. 
  In mid-November 1993, the NPC Standing Committee received a 
joint letter addressed to Qiao Shi and Li Peng by more than 20 
important members urging for the overhaul of the public security 
organs and for holding them accountable for "unhealthy 
tendencies." They urged the dismissal of Public Security 
Minister Tao Siju. 
  This was the second time the NPC Standing Committee made 
such 
a request. What on earth is behind the "public anger" toward 
the public security minister and the public security organs? 
  To understand this, let us begin with the relevant 
instructions given by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi. 
<H5>  Strongly Worded Instructions by Jiang, Li, and Qiao </H5>
  On 8 November, Jiang Zemin gave these instructions: The 
problems in public security organs are very salient. Their 
personnel and organization are very loose and their discipline 
and systems very disorganized. This can no longer be tolerated 
and must be handled and overhauled as a major project by the 
local party committees. 
  One can see the seriousness of the matter when Jiang Zemin 
described the lawlessness among public security organs with such 
adjectives as "very salient," "very loose," and "very 
disorganized" and when he asserted that the situation can no 
longer be tolerated. 
  Li Peng's instructions, however, illustrated the popular 
anger at the law-enforcement organizations' knowing violation of 
the law when he said: "The public security organs are the 
state's law- enforcement organs. The present situation has led 
to strong dissatisfaction within and outside the party. This 
must be changed radically, and the role of the state's 
law-enforcement organs should be brought into full play." 
  Qiao Shi, long in charge of procuratorial and judicial work, 
gave very specific instructions when he said: "The situation of 
some public security organs and leading groups is very serious. 
The investigation teams and stationary teams sent to the basic 
units should rely on their local party committees and on the 
policemen of public security organs to quickly change the 
current passivity. Those who should be dismissed should be 
dismissed; those who should be transferred should be 
transferred; those who should be coped with should be coped 
with, and those who should be punished should be punished in 
accordance with the law." 
  This trouble has been brewing for quite some time. The 
deterioration of the public security contingent has long been a 
knotty problem for the CPC. Recently, the central authorities 
even organized "working teams," "investigation teams," and 
"stationary teams" to tackle the serious problems in the public 
security organs. In fact, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi 
made the above instructions in light of the preliminary 
investigations of these working teams. 
<H5>  The Working Teams Are Threatened With "Death" </H5>
  This time, the overhaul embraces a wide scope unseen in 
recent years. It stretches to every level from the center to 
localities. On 11 November, the State Council General Office, 
the Ministry of Supervision, various organs, and various 
ministries and commissions and offices sent 35 investigation 
teams and stationary teams to the public security departments 
(bureaus) of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions and to the public security bureaus of some key special 
zones. This was followed by the 270 or more working teams and 
investigation teams or stationary teams sent on 15 November to 
the public security bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and 
autonomous prefectures. 
  Nevertheless, the investigations met strong resistance. It 
reportedly happened in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Hainan, and 
Hunan that the central investigation teams or stationary teams 
were confronted and threatened. It even happened that anonymous 
letters containing "death" threats were received in Shaanxi. 
  The gravity of the problem can be understood from a piece 
of statistical information issued by the Ministry of Public 
Security--out of the public security departments (bureaus) at 
the provincial level across China, 22 public security 
departments (bureaus) have had their party committee leaders 
reshuffled or readjusted; 47 vice department (bureau) heads have 
either been dismissed, transferred, or persuaded to retire; and 
over 180 sectional cadres have either been dismissed, 
transferred, or persuaded to retire. 
<H3>  The Serious Damage Lies in the Fact That the Law-Enforcement 
Organs Break the Law </H3>
  Figures released internally by the State Council General 
Office and public security organs have revealed the "internal 
scandal" of the public security organs: 
  In 1992, the relevant quarters received over 32,300 reports 
and complaints about the misdeeds of public security organs and 
public security personnel. Between January and October 1993, 
the number of such reports and complaints reached over 27,600. 
Over 70 percent of the reports and complaints concerned 
breaches of the law, racketeering, and blackmail. In addition, 
over 830 serious homicides were caused in 1992 as a result of 
public security departments breaking the law and closing their 
eyes to national laws. 
  In 1992, 1.86 percent of public security personnel received 
party discipline or administrative punishment, 0.97 percent were 
prosecuted, and over 72,500 were transferred or had their names 
expunged. 
<H5>  They Got Their Jobs Through Improper Means </H5>
  Many factors contribute to the poor quality of the CPC's 
public security contingent, of which a very important one is 
that the new public security recruits are of poor quality. The 
reason that they are of such low quality is that some unemployed 
young people or former young prisoners have been used to fill 
the police ranks as an expedient means of livelihood, whereas 
many good young people -- taking into consideration the bad 
image of the "cops" -- do not want to join the force. Even 
worse, many of them have joined the police force through 
improper means such as utilizing connections. Obviously, they 
have joined in order to hide their infamous past. 
  According to GONGAN TONGXUN [Public Security Newsletter] 
published by the Ministry of Public Security, the Guangdong 
Public Security Department recently organized a task force to 
investigate the new recruits of the public security organs in 
the special economic zones and coastal areas. They found that 
over 60 percent of the new recruits had previously been 
unemployed or idle young people; over 40 percent had had medium 
poor or poor character at school; and over 20 percent had 
engaged in gang fighting, theft, hooliganism, and the like. 
Moreover, they found that the 65 percent of formerly unemployed 
or idle young people had joined public security organs without 
going the through normal examination process. 
  The Anhui Provincial Public Security Department's findings 
were even more startling. With the help of the central and 
provincial party committee's investigation teams, they conducted 
investigations of the personnel of the public security organs in 
the cities of Huainan, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Maanshan, and 
Huaibei. They found that over 85 percent of the personnel 
recruited since the fall of 1990 were formerly unemployed or 
idle young people and that 20 percent were rural young people 
who had only finished the first year of their secondary 
education and had joined the police force through unusual 
connections. After rechecking them, they found that over 36 
percent of the new recruits had either been punished for 
criminal activities or had received administrative warnings. 
  Public security organs have their own records: By examining 
the sources of public security personnel in over 600 large, 
medium, and small cities, between 1986 and 1989, we can see that 
12 percent graduated from public security and police academies, 
22 percent were demobilized and retired servicemen, 30 percent 
were young people from industrial and mining establishments, and 
36 percent were formerly unemployed young people. Excepting 
those in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shandong, the recruits had only 
finished the first year of their secondary education. 
  Since 1990, 14 percent of the recruits have graduated from 
public security or police academies, 19 percent have been 
demobilized and retired servicemen, 26 percent have been young 
people from industrial and mining establishments, and 41 percent 
have been unemployed young people. Except for those in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, and Liaoning, recruits have, on 
average, finished the second year of their secondary education. 
<H3>  Eighty Percent of the People Are Dissatisfied With the 
Public Security Personnel </H3>
  The CPC's propaganda machine describes the public security 
personnel as guards "defending the dignity of the motherland." 
Unfortunately, their lofty image is no longer popular in society 
today. In public opinion polls, policemen are often the most 
unwelcome individuals. On 23 November, the State Statistical 
Bureau empowered 16 large and medium cities in Guangdong, 
Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hebei to conduct a large-scale 
public opinion poll. Regarding the situation of public security 
organs and public security personnel, they interviewed over 
15,000 people, including party and government cadres, 
intellectuals, staff and workers, students, and housewives. 
They found that 73 percent of the interviewees were 
dissatisfied with the practice and work performance of the 
public security organs, 8 percent were extremely dissatisfied, 
and only 19 percent were satisfied. 
  It does not help change the bad image of public security 
personnel in the eyes of the people to merely depend on 
instructions from the central authorities, on overhauling 
leading groups, or on shooting a few people, because the 
question of the public security organs concerns the overall CPC 
structure. Public security personnel wearing hats with the 
national emblem are not above the common man. They have already 
lost their sense of values in pursuit of money and luxury. 
Shielded by the one-party dictatorship, their power has become 
the best weapon in the service of graft and corruption. Law 
enforcement personnel who break the law and are corrupt and 
degenerate are the product of the rule by man in the CPC.

  [Text] The wife of dissident Fu Shenqi, Li Liping, has 
been allowed to return home after she was detained for 15 days 
by Shanghai court officials who accused her of "contempt of 
court". 
  Ms Li, who returned home last week, said she was "forcefully 
detained" by Huangpu District Court officials after she was told 
that the court had rejected a lawsuit filed by Fu. 
  "Please help us now. We, the family, can no longer protect 
itself (against the Government)," she said. 
  "We are driven to the wall. There is no road to heaven and 
no door into the earth," she pleaded. 
  The ordeal of Fu has caught the attention of the United 
States Government which has warned that China might lose her low 
tariffs trade status this June if it fails to make "significant 
progress" on human rights. 
  Fu was sentenced without trial by Shanghai police last June 
to three years "reeducation through labour" for instigating four 
other Shanghai activists to start a hunger strike. 
  Fu has denied he was responsible for the hunger strike and 
has filed a lawsuit against the labour reform authorities for 
holding him illegally. 
  The court held its first hearing last November at the Dafeng 
Farm in Yancheng District where Fu was held. Although Fu was 
represented by two lawyers, he was not allowed to call witnesses. 
  When Fu's lawyers were notified on December 28 that a 
verdict 
had been reached, Ms Li went to the Huangpu District Court. She 
was told that the judges had decided to uphold the original 
sentence without giving reasons. 
  Ms Li was so upset she accused the judges of a "miscarriage 
of justice" and acting "against their conscience". She was 
manhandled and taken away by court officials who accused her of 
"contempt of court" and "cursing the people's judges". 
  She was locked in the Huangpu District Detention Centre for 
15 days with about 10 "criminals" in a small cell.

  [Text] A Hong Kong businessman who has been detained 
incommunicado for 29 months in central China has started a 
hunger strike, according to sources. Chong Kwee-sung, an 
employee of a Hong Kong based trading company who has been held 
in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, since August 1991, stopped eating 
a week ago, hoping to draw the attention of the Chinese 
authorities to his ordeal. 
  Neither Chong nor his family has been told which law he is 
accused of breaking and whether he will ever be brought to trial. 
  Sources said Chong still maintained his innocence and had 
complained of the great pain he had to endure in detention. 
  The hunger strike was the only piece of news in 2 and 1/2 
years that showed the 56 year-old businessman was still alive. 
He disappeared 29 months ago when he was taken into custody by 
Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau officials in Shenzhen. 
  The family said they were greatly distressed by the 
information and feared for Chong. "My father is a stubborn man. 
He always does what he says," said Chong's daughter, Ivy Chong, 
who lives in Oregon. 
  Another informed source confirmed that Chong had started the 
hunger strike but said he could not ascertain his condition now. 
  Chong travelled to the mainland on a, Home Return Permit and 
is still a Hong Kong resident, although his family long ago 
migrated to the U.S. The daughter was worried that the hunger 
strike might worsen her father's stomach illness. 
  Zhengzhou police were adamant that Chong be held responsible 
for a commercial dispute involving the Central China 
International Economic and Trading Corp in the city. According 
to documents available, Zhengzhou police claimed that Chong was 
behind a "fraudulent case" which involved the shipment of about 
1,000 defective bicycles to the U.S. The corporation declined 
to accept responsibility when the American buyers rejected the 
merchandise on safety grounds. Chong, broker of the deal, was 
then detained by Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau officials, 
apparently as "collateral". 
  Repeated efforts by Chong's employer in Hong Kong to solve 
the dispute through mediation have been unsuccessful. 
  Although Chong's case has been brought to the attention of 
top officials in both Beijing and London, there has been 
virtually no progress in the past 29 months. Requests by the 
family to visit him in Zhengzhou have been rejected. 
  Ms Chong said Central China International Economic and 
Trading Corp executives who were on good terms with Zhengzhou 
Public Security Bureau officials had persistently lobbied 
Beijing not to intervene although they were unable to find 
enough evidence to convict her father. The corporation had made 
no demands. "What puzzled us is that despite the long detention, 
they still haven't told us what they want? Do they want money? 
We have no idea," she said. Ms Chong said the family was 
seeking legal advice as to whether they can take the Zhengzhou 
Public Security Bureau to court. 
  Chinese University expert on mainland law Chang Hsin, said 
Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau officials might have violated 
China's criminal law. He said since Chong was arrested over a 
fraud case, Zhengzhou officials might have broken their own law 
which allows them to only hold him for three months without 
further authorisation. But Mr Chang cautioned that there could 
be "dozens of unpublicised internal rules and regulations".

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 19 (AFP)--The Chinese Government 
Wednesday warned regional authorities on the possibility of 
social instability this year as a side-effect of China's 
unprecedented economic reforms. 
  "This year will see the highest degree of reforms," said 
Hong 
Hu, vice-minister of the state commission for restructuring the 
economy, adding that the greater the degree of reform, "the 
stronger the social impact will be." 
  "Governments at all levels will act in accordance with the 
overall arrangement of the central committee and the State 
Council," he said at a news conference. "We will deepen the 
reforms and maintain stability," he added. 
  Beijing decided in November to speed up liberalisation of 
the 
economy, particularly reform of state enterprises, banking, real 
estate, and the taxation and price systems. 
  Hong said the reforms were necessary to establish a 
socialist 
market economy, but were risky as China was facing inflationary 
pressure from the previous year. 
  But, he added, "we are confident of keeping inflation under 
10 percent" in 1994. 
  In 1993, the economy grew at 13 percent, with the cost of 
living climbing 14 percent, despite an austerity plan imposed 
during the second half of the year. 
  Last year's overheated economy was aggravated by the 
inability of the authorities to fully control provincial 
development, and Beijing knows future economic liberalisation 
has to be controlled to prevent chaos, Chinese and western 
experts said. 
  One of the most dangerous reforms socially is the 
transformation of state enterprises, making them responsible for 
their own losses and profits. "It is the most difficult area", 
said Hong. 
  One third of state firms suffered losses last year, with 
another third encountering financial difficulties, according to 
government sources. 
  These reforms have to be accompanied by a stricter 
application of bankruptcy laws, and could cause millions of 
lay-offs. 
  For the time being, the reforms will be applied in the 100 
largest companies. "The most important (thing) is to improve 
and reinforce macro-control," Hong said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This year 
will prove to be mainland China's "legislation year," in which 
over 10 economic laws will be adopted and put into effect, 
including a "law on foreign trade," "law on commercial banks," 
"law on joint-stock cooperative enterprises," "law on swap 
transactions," "labor law," "insurance law," "securities law," 
"trust law," "bills law," "real estate law," and "auction law. 
The "Company Law" was the first to be promulgated: It was 
adopted at the end of 1993 and took effect on New Year's Day of 
1994. 
  Under the present situation where mainland China is bringing 
its economy into the orbit of a market economy, all this 
legislation is undoubted urgently needed by the country. It has 
been reported that in the next five years, the mainland plans to 
adopt 152 laws concerning such fields as the economy, justice, 
culture and education, and environmental protection. The most 
prominent of all is the economic legislations. Last 29 
November, at the closing ceremony of the Fifth Session of the 
NPC [National People's Congress] Standing Committee, NPC 
Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi indicated that the NPC 
Standing Committee would continue to place the work of speeding 
up legislation, especially economic legislation, in a primary 
position; strive to enable legislative work to keep pace with 
reform; and use laws to guide, push forward, and guarantee 
reform. He said: The NPC Standing Committee should step up 
efforts and work out laws badly needed in such fields as 
finance, money, bonds, and securities. He stressed: After laws 
are promulgated, we must resolutely put them into practice, for 
a failure to put laws into effect means there is no law at all. 
  As a result of China's feudal history of several thousand 
years, during which the emperors' imperial edicts were regarded 
as more authoritative than laws by local officials, an awareness 
of rule by law was relatively weak at both the higher and lower 
levels. It may be for this reason that stories about "Justice 
Bao [an imperial magistrate famous for his wisdom and fairness]" 
are so popular these days. Even today, some officials on the 
mainland often refuse to act according to the law and they are 
used to handling economic and social disputes with 
administrative means. Some cadres abuse their power and 
authority for private gain, or forget about their duties the 
moment they see an opportunity for making a profit. It is clear 
that such a situation would undoubtedly create obstacles and 
hidden dangers for the smooth operation of the market economy. 
  As a matter of fact, during a period when the mainland is 
trying to change the operational pattern of its economy, a 
number of deeper contradictions in the economic field still 
remain unsolved, most state-owned enterprises are still plagued 
by losses, the rate of wage increases is falling behind 
inflation, many workers and staff are leading a relatively 
difficult life, and a number of social contradictions which have 
been triggered by inflation have added to those factors leading 
to social instability. Under such circumstances, a failure of 
government offices at all levels to act according to the law and 
to stop lawbreakers from fishing in troubled waters will 
probably lead to turbulence in the society. It is exactly based 
on this consideration that we need to put into practice the 
"bankruptcy law" and the "social insurance law" (including 
unemployment relief funds and pensions). Meanwhile, we need to 
work out and further perfect laws on building a clean 
administration and on the campaign against corruption to provide 
more powerful legal grounds for handing down effective 
punishments for corrupt officials and bribe takers. 
  Free competition is allowed under a market economic system. 
However, due to different conditions and economic strengths 
enjoyed by state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, 
privately run enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises, a 
question has thus emerged on whether or not there is fair 
competition. The "Law Against Illegal Means of Competition," 
which was adopted by the mainland in October last year, filled 
this gap, thus providing favorable guarantees for all sides. 
With this law, all departments, enterprises, units, and 
individuals wishing to enter the market can neither enjoy 
privileges or monopolize the market, nor beat down their rivals 
by dumping products. The "law on foreign trade," which is to be 
promulgated this year, also carries clauses on drastically 
reducing import tariffs and preventing the dumping of foreign 
goods. 
  The "Company Law," which took effect on New Year's Day of 
this year, mainly aims at establishing the status of companies 
as the main body in the market structure, standardizing the 
organizational structure and conduct of companies, enabling 
state-owned enterprises to carry out reform of their property 
rights and head for a corporate joint-stock system, and at 
finally setting up a modern enterprise system which regards the 
laws of the market as the main productive factor. 
  Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has 
indicated that China should base its legislation "on its own 
national conditions and boldly assimilate and use for reference 
the accomplishments and experience of foreign countries in 
legislation." He noted that it has become the usual practice of 
all countries in the world to assimilate and use for reference 
the legislative experiences of other countries. He stressed 
that when adopting economic legislation, China should not, and 
sees no need to, start everything from the very beginning; 
instead, it can transplant to China from foreign countries laws 
that suit China's national conditions and which enjoy the common 
nature of a market economy. This is also a shortcut for China to 
accelerate its adoption of market economic legislation. The 
mainland probably plans to take such "shortcuts" when it adopts 
152 new laws in the next five years.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS)--China will quicken its 
pace in the restructuring of the social security system with the 
focus on improvement of a pension system for urban workers and 
of the social security system. Insurance premiums will be borne 
by individuals and entitles while a new practice of paying 
premiums will be employed. This was revealed at a meeting held 
by the China People's Insurance Company today. 
  The social security system reform mainly covers the setting 
up of an individual pension account for urban workers with the 
pension premium being calculated in proportion to one's wage and 
shared by the employee and the employer who hired the worker. 
The paid premium is registered in the worker's individual 
account and the amount the worker has to pay in the period to 
come will increase gradually to a level that the employer should 
share. 
  The public expenses and medical care system for the workers 
is also under reform with the aim of creating a medical 
insurance system covering individual medical accounts and social 
insurance funding for serious illness. The money used for the 
present medical system with its expense jointly shared by 
enterprises and the governmental department will be divided into 
two parts, one part for the establishment of a social insurance 
fund for medical expenses for serious illness suffered by 
workers while the other part is for the setting up of an 
individual medical account for general spending on medical care. 
  The scope for unemployment insurance will expand to 
gradually 
create a better unemployment insurance system to cover workers 
of state-owned, collective and privately-owned enterprises and 
those employed by the Chinese partner in foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  Under the current social security system, beneficiaries are 
restricted to workers of government organs and state-owned 
enterprises as well as a handful of residents suffering great 
difficulties, making up a mere 30 percent of the total labour 
force. The money needed for the system will be mainly funded by 
the state and raised by enterprises themselves. Owing to its 
national situation, China cannot afford high welfare spending 
and instead should practice fund-raising by individuals in a bid 
to ease the burden on the state and enterprises. In rural areas 
peasants must maintain the practice of supporting their family 
elders at the present stage.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- A new social 
security system has taken initial shape in China following 14 
years of reform and has begun playing a major role in social 
life. 
  With the deepening of the enterprise restructuring, the 
introduction and perfection of the social security system are 
essential to the success of reforms in other areas. 
  In China, social security includes old-age pension insurance 
for employees in manufacturing, government offices and other 
institutions in urban and rural areas, unemployment relief, 
medical insurance, birth insurance and insurance for industrial 
accidents. 
  Under the old planned economy the state was responsible for 
providing unemployment relief, and employers for covering 
virtually all their insurance. 
  Practice shows that that approach has failed to meet the 
needs of a socialist market economy and a modern enterprise 
system. 
  The new social security system will free enterprises, 
especially major state-owned ones, from the burden of "running 
society" -- taking charge of all employees' welfare -- so that 
they will able to participate in fair market competition. 
  The funds for social security will come from mutual 
assistance funds and will be distributed by relevant government 
departments. Mutual assistance funds will come from the state, 
enterprises and employees. 
  An official of the Labor Ministry said that the pension 
insurance system has already been instituted in the overwhelming 
majority of urban businesses. The nation's funds for old-age 
pensions, shared by the state, employers and employees, now 
total 30 billion yuan a year, he said. 
  He said that most provinces in China have begun to institute 
an unemployment relief system, considered an urgent reform 
measure. Under that system, enterprises withhold 0.6 to one 
percent of their employees' wages as mutual-assistance 
unemployment insurance funds. 
  As a result, the country can use 900 million yuan in such 
funds annually to assist workers who have lost their jobs, he 
said. 
  He also acknowledged that the reform of the medical 
insurance 
system is the "most difficult" task and is still in the 
experimental stage. 
  Nationwide, the bulk of medical costs for most urban workers 
are now still covered by their work units. In a change from the 
past practice, however, workers now have to cover a portion of 
their medical costs -- ranging from five percent to 20 percent. 
  The official said that the distribution of unemployment 
relief funds has begun. For example, such funds were granted to 
900,000 unemployed workers in 1993. 
  Insurance agencies attached to government labor departments 
will give such funds to jobless workers in line with 
internationally accepted practices. Furthermore, they will 
train such workers and help them find new jobs. 
  To date, China has set up 2,200 training centers and 9,700 
job placement agencies, he said. 
  Medical insurance costs are set to be shared by the state, 
work units and employees, he said. With the implementation of 
the wage reform and the increase in wages, the ratio of medical 
costs to be covered by individuals is expected to rise 
gradually, he added. 
  According to the official, this year China will try to 
expand 
the coverage of social security to all urban workers and to 
improve the functions of social security departments. 
  Following the revision, the labor law drafted by the Labor 
Ministry and other central departments will be submitted to the 
National People's Congress for approval, he said. The drafting 
of China's social security law is well under way, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jan (XINHUA) -- The General Office of 
the State Council issued a circular yesterday urging localities 
and departments to put an end to the selling of public housing 
at excessively low prices and to exercise more effective 
leadership over the reform of the urban housing system. The 
circular urges them to carry out a general review of sales of 
public housing in the near future and to handle with care and 
skill the losses of state assets resulting from sale of public 
housing at excessively low prices. 
  It has been learned that the Third National Conference on 
Reform of the Urban Housing System adopted a housing reform plan 
which, in addition to establishing common reserve funds for 
housing, requires that public housing be sold in a planned 
manner under a unified State Council policy. It also repeatedly 
stresses that special care should be taken to prevent the sale 
of public housing at excessively low prices. Recently, 
government organs, enterprises, and establishments in some 
localities have, however, rushed to sell public housing at 
excessively low prices. This has resulted in huge losses of 
state assets. In some instances, proceeds from the sales were 
diverted to other uses. These transgressions are not conducive 
to the sound development of housing reform, and they tend to 
engender unhealthy practices. 
  To prevent the selling of public housing at excessively low 
prices, to steadfastly implement the unified policy of the State 
Council on urban housing reform, and to ensure the sound 
development of housing reform, the State Council General 
Office's circular stipulated: 
  1. All localities or departments must, without exception, 
halt the selling of public housing pending the promulgation of 
the "Decision of the State Council on Accelerating the Reform of 
the Urban Housing System." Any violations of the State Council 
regulations banning the rushed sale of public housing will be 
investigated thoroughly. 
  2. A review of housing already sold should be carried out. 
All formalities without exception must be suspended for housing 
that has been sold at a price lower than what is set out in the 
State Council policy but for which property rights transfers or 
ownership registration procedures have not been completed. 
Where there are losses of state assets due to the sale of 
public housing at excessively low prices, the localities or 
departments must formulate a plan to comply with the relevant 
State Council policy and carry it out in appropriately. 
  3. Improve the management of proceeds generated by sales of 
housing. Proceeds from housing already sold must be frozen at 
the units concerned pending further instructions. They cannot 
be used for any purpose. In case of violations, the person 
directly involved and the leaders concerned will be investigated 
for their responsibility. 
  The circular urges provincial, autonomous regional, and 
municipal governments to carry out a general review of public 
housing sales in the near future and to submit their findings to 
the State Council's Leading Group for Housing System Reform.

  [Text] Jakarta, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Indonesian 
President Suharto received General Liu Huaqing, the visiting 
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's 
Republic of China, here today at the presidential palace, and 
the two sides held cordial and friendly talks. 
  In their talks, the Indonesian head of state praised China's 
policy of giving priority to develop economy. He said that in 
the last decade, the speed of Chinese economic development has 
been faster than the other developing countries. The 
achievements gained by China have laid solid foundation for 
further implementing cooperation between China and Indonesia, as 
well as providing good conditions for security and cooperation 
in the Asian and Pacific region. 
  Briefing Vice Chairman Liu on the state of affairs of 
Indonesia's economic construction, President Suharto said that 
the stable political situation and the unified armed forces have 
guaranteed the smooth growth of economy. 
  He stressed that only after the economy growing stronger, 
could the national defence be strengthened, and only with 
powerful national defence, could the economic construction be 
carried out successfully. 
  The president said that Indonesia is willing to develop 
armed 
forces relationship with all countries on the base of five 
principles of peaceful coexistence. 
  Indonesia also held that countries should respect each 
other's state sovereignty, not interfere in each other's 
internal affairs, carry out cooperation for each other's mutual 
interests, so as to build up a new international political and 
economic order, he added. 
  Vice Chairman Liu spoke highly of the achievements in 
Indonesia under the leadership of President Suharto. He said 
that during his visit here, he witnessed prosperous successes 
everywhere. 
  On bilateral relations, Vice Chairman Liu said that thanks 
to 
the profound concern from President Suharto, the relationship 
between China and Indonesia has developed soundly, so is the 
relations between the two armed forces. 
  Vice Chairman Liu pointed out that no basic interest 
differences had ever existed between the two countries. There 
is only friendship between China and Indonesia. 
  As both being big Asian countries, he said, China and 
Indonesia should strengthen the friendly cooperation which is 
not only beneficial to the two countries, but will also bring 
positive impact on peace and stability in this region and the 
world. 
  Vice Chairman Liu said China is willing to develop 
cooperative and mutual trust relations with the Southeast Asian 
countries. China sincerely wishes that permanent peace and 
stability will exist in the Asian and Pacific region. 
  After making a brief introduction on China's economic 
construction, Vice Chairman Liu pointed out that the tasks for 
China's economic construction are arduous, therefore, the 
expenditure on national defence construction is very limited. 
He stressed that China's policy on national defence is 
defensive. The Chinese Liberation Army is only for defence. It 
will never invade others. 
  During the meeting, Indonesian Armed Forces 
Commander-in-Chief General Feisal Tanjung was present. 
  Present on the occasion on the Chinese side were Lieutenant 
General Xu Huizi, deputy chief of General Staff of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army, and Lieutenant General Tao Bojun, 
deputy commander of the Guangzhou Military Command.
