  [Text] Beijing, Jan 18 (XINHUA) -- China will continue to 
provide assistance within its capability to Cambodia for use in 
its restoration and reconstruction, reiterated President Jiang 
Zemin here today when he met with distinguished guests from 
Cambodia. 
  Jiang Zemin had a 40-minute meeting with a delegation from 
the Kingdom of Cambodia led by First Prime Minister Norodom 
Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen this afternoon at 
the Great Hall of the People. The two sides exchanged views on 
Sino-Cambodian relations and other issues. 
  On behalf of the Cambodian Government, Ranariddh thanked 
China for its aid to Cambodia during its transitional period and 
for its reconstruction. 
  Jiang Zemin said: The visit by the two prime ministers soon 
after its inauguration shows that the Government of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia attaches great importance to its friendly and 
cooperative relations with China. The visit, a great event in 
bilateral relations, will promote mutual understanding and 
friendship and further advance friendship and cooperation 
between the two countries in various fields. 
  Ranariddh said that his delegation held fruitful talks with 
Premier Li Peng yesterday, and that he believed the visit would 
further consolidate and improve Sino-Cambodian relations. 
  Jiang said: In 1993, Cambodia underwent an enormous change 
of historical significance: After more than 20 years of war, 
the country has now entered a new period of peaceful 
reconstruction. This change not only reflected the Cambodian 
people's common will but also was in line with the major trend 
of peace and development in the region. The Chinese Government 
sincerely hopes that the Cambodian Government will cherish the 
hard-won peace, further advance the process of national 
reconciliation, and mobilize all the Cambodian people to build 
their country. 
  Ranariddh said: Cambodia has now entered a new period of 
national unity. Although facing difficulties, Cambodians are 
optimistic about their future. Under the leadership of King 
Sihanouk, they will build Cambodia into a country of 
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and prosperity. 
  Jiang Zemin asked the two prime ministers to relay his best 
wishes and heartfelt regards to King Sihanouk and the queen. He 
said: King Sihanouk is the beloved leader of the Cambodian 
people and respected friend of the Chinese people, and he has 
made indelible contributions to Cambodia's independence. 
  Wang Wenyuan, vice chairman of the Jiusan Society, was 
present at the meeting. 
  Earlier today the Cambodian guests laid a wreath at the 
Monument to the People's Heroes and paid their respects to the 
remains of Chairman Mao Zedong. They also visited the Xuehua 
Electronics Group and the Beijing shirt mill. They are 
scheduled to visit Hainan Province tomorrow.

from Jan. 11-15 by the Vietnamese and Chinese experts to review 
the implementation of the provisional agreement on settling 
matters in the border area between the two countries. 
  At the meeting, the two sides stressed the need to seriously 
honour the provisional agreement which was signed (by Vietnam 
and China) on Nov. 7, 1991, control the border area basing on 
the status quo at the time of signing the above-said agreement 
without any artificial actions made in order to change the 
border situation, promote the opening of the official border 
gates agreed by the two sides and try to restore order and law

negotiations to settle them properly and at the same time report 
them to their respective governments.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Some 120 
Chinese-made motor vehicles will soon appear on the streets of 
Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, as police and official 
vehicles. 
  The "Happiness" brand motor vehicles were made by Yichu 
Company, a joint venture established ten years ago by the Chia 
Tai group of Thailand and Shanghai. 
  It is the first time for 20 years that Thailand will approve 
such imports, according to company officials. Thai laws 
prohibit import of assembled motor vehicles. 
  The vehicles were bought by the Chia Tai group, which will 
present them to the Thai imperial house. 
  It will be a great chance for promotion, said Li Jingai, 
deputy general manager of Yichu. 
  Yichu produced 238,000 motor vehicles last year, which were 
all sold, and reported a sales volume of 1.5 billion yuan. 
  It will produce about 280,000 vehicles this year, with a 
sales volume of some two billion yuan, a top company official 
said.

Abdur Rahman Biswar met a visiting eight-member delegation of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Wen Jiabao, alternate 
member of the Polit-bureau of the Central Committee of CPC, this 
afternoon at the presidential house. 
  During the meeting, the Bangladesh president spoke highly of 
the traditional friendship between the two countries. 
  He said China is now concentrating on the economic 
development and has made great achievements in all areas. The 
Bangladesh people are happy to see what the Chinese people have 
achieved. 
  Talking about the foreign policy of his country, the 
president stressed that Bangladesh follows the policy of "making 
friendship with all and non-hostile against anyone". Bangladesh 
advocates peaceful coexistence among all countries, he added. 
  In his speech, Wen described the traditional friendship 
between the two countries as a time-tested one. 
  Wen briefed the Bangladesh president on achievements of the 
opening and reform drive in China that was launched 15 years ago. 
  He said that China's efforts to continue its reform and 
opening policy and establish a socialist market economy are 
compatible to the country's specific conditions and have won 
support from all the Chinese people. 
  It is China's unchangeable basic state policy to center on 
the reform and opening drive and economic construction, he added. 
  Earlier in the afternoon, the delegation held formal talks 
with the delegation of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party 
(BNP) headed by its General Secretary Abdus Salam Talukder. 
  The BNP general secretary said the strengthening of friendly 
exchanges between the two parties in the recent few years have 
paved the way for a new, broad prospect in future, which is 
helpful for further developing the friendly relationship between 
the two countries. 
  Wen hoped that the two parties will further promote mutual 
understanding and friendship and cooperate in a wider scope. 
  This morning, the CPC delegation laid a wreath in front of 
the Bangladesh monument to national martyrs and visited an 
export processing zone in the suburb of Dhaka. 
  The CPC delegation arrived in Dhaka on Thursday [13 January] 
at the invitation of the BNP. Bangladesh is the last leg of the 
delegation's three-country trip. The other two are Singapore 
and India.

  [Text] Dhaka, January 15 (XINHUA) -- A visiting delegation 
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by Wen Jiabao, 
alternative member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau, paid a visit to a rural women's cooperative 35 km north 
of Dhaka on Saturday [15 January] morning. 
  Accompanied by officials from the Bangladesh Rural 
Development Bureau (BRDB) and Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh 
Zhang Xujiang, the CPC delegation visited the cooperative known 
as the Digirchala Women's Cooperative Society. 
  The cooperative, which used to be a village with 200 
households, is one of the 4,000 such bodies organized by the 
BRDB throughout the country. 
  During the trip, the Chinese visitors were warmly received 
by 
a group of women from the cooperative. 
  According to the women villagers, after setting up the 
cooperative in 1984, they have no longer merely depended on 
their husbands to support the families. 
  Since then, they have been engaged in raising poultry, 
cattle 
and goats as well as fishery, tailoring and handicraft-making, 
they said. 
  Talking with the women villagers, Wen said that he was very 
happy to visit the cooperative and was very impressed about 
their hard efforts and achievements. 
  Wen, who is also a member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat, expressed his hopes that the rural economy in 
Bangladesh will be further developed through the efforts of the 
women's cooperatives. 
  The CPC group arrived here on Wednesday at the invitation of 
the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

Qichen, vice-premier and foreign minister of the People's 
Republic of China, who arrived here last Saturday [15 January] 
for a goodwill visit to Kenya. 
  President arap Moi expressed welcome to Qian Qichen, saying 
that Qian's visit will further promote development of the 
friendly relations and cooperation between Kenya [words

  Qian Qichen conveyed greetings to President arap Moi from 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. He said the 
Chinese president is expecting President arap Moi's visit to 
China. 
  During the meeting both sides expressed satisfaction over

President arap Moi and the Kenyan Government in promoting 
Sino-Kenyan relations, maintaining regional peace and stability

  Qian said that there are potentialities for cooperation 
between China and Kenya though conditions in the two countries 
are not all same. He said that China is willing to make joint 
efforts to constantly strengthen and develop friendship and 
cooperation between China and Kenya. 
  Arap Moi said that the friendship between the Kenyan and

conflicts in Somalia and maintaining regional peace. 
  Qian said that Africa is facing new difficulties and 
challenge. He said that China is following a policy of reform

on economic development. Despite all kinds of pressure from the 
outside, China has constantly taken economic construction as its 
central task in national development. 
  Qian appreciated the efforts made by Kenya in upholding 
national unity, developing national economy and maintaining 
regional peace and stability. He wished Kenya success. 
  President arap Moi appreciated the great changes in China's 
national construction resulting from the Chinese Government's 
policy of reform and opening to the outside world. He indicated 
that Kenya will make further efforts to develop the country by 
relying on its own efforts.

  [Text] Nairobi, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Kenyan 
Vice-President George Saitoti said here today that Kenya is very 
grateful to China for its aid to Kenya and outstanding 
commitment to Africa. 
  Saitoti made the remarks while meeting visiting Chinese 
Vice- 
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who paid a courtesy 
call on the Kenyan vice-president. 
  Saitoti noted that Kenya and China have shared a good 
relationship for 30 years, adding that "your country, although a 
developing country, has been able to render substantial 
assistance to our country. We Kenyan people consider Chinese 
the very true friend of Kenya." 
  He cited Arap Moi International Sports Complex built by the 
Chinese Government as an example of China's aid to Kenya, saying 
that the Kenyan Government is very much pleased with the 
assistance provided by the Chinese Government in education, 
health and other fields. 
  Kenya, he said, is going through a fundamental economic 
reform. He expressed the hope that more Chinese businessmen 
would invest in Kenya "either through joint venture or direct 
investment." 
  Meanwhile, the Kenyan vice-president said that there are 
thousands of Somali and Sudanese refugees in his country, which 
have posed heavy burden on Kenya in social and economic 
respects. He appealed to the international community as well as 
China to continue the efforts to bring peace to Somalia and the 
Sudan. 
  In response, Qian Qichen said the Chinese Government is 
satisfied with the development of the relations between China 
and Kenya, hailing the importance the Kenyan Government has 
attached to the relations between the two countries and peoples. 
  "We also appreciate your adherence to the one China policy," 
said the Chinese vice-premier. 
  "Kenya is a very important country in East Africa," Qian 
said. He voiced his appreciation to the Kenyan Government, 
especially President Daniel arap Moi, for the important role 
they have played in promoting the peace in Somalia and the Sudan. 
  On the trade relations between the two countries, Qian said 
the Chinese Government is willing to strengthen economic 
cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Co-existence. 
  Moreover, Qian expected that his visit will further promote 
the relations between the two countries. 
  The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here 
on 
Saturday [15 January] and this is his second visit to Kenya. He 
is leaving here tomorrow for Madagascar.

  [Text] Nairobi, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Kenyan Minister for 
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Stephen Musyoka 
and his visiting Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen held talks here 
today on the cooperative relations between China and Kenya and 
some issues of common concern. 
  Musyoka said the relations between the two countries are 
very 
good, adding that Kenya is attaching importance to cooperation 
between the two countries and this is in the interests of the 
peoples of the two countries. 
  He said the Chinese people are a great people and have got 
experience in constructing their country, noting that the Kenyan 
people should learn from them. 
  Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said Kenya 
and 
China have been supporting each other in safeguarding national 
independence and sovereignty and in developing national economy. 
  He said China treasures the friendship between the two 
countries. He said the two governments have shared common and 
similar views on some international affairs and regional issues, 
adding that it is encouraging to see that the Sino-Kenyan 
cooperation is developing in political, economic and cultural 
areas. 
  The two governments, Qian said, should encourage 
entrepreneurs of the two countries to make direct contact so as 
to seek chances for cooperation. 
  Musyoka briefed the Chinese vice-premier on the efforts the 
Kenyan Government has made in seeking peaceful solution to the 
Somali crisis and the Sudanese problem, saying that Kenya will 
continue to play a positive role in achieving peace and 
stability in the region. 
  Qian praised Kenya for its policies of non-alignment, 
thinking hghly of the friendship with its neighbors and actively 
promoting peace and cooperation in the region. 
  On the issue of South Africa, Qian said, the Chinese 
Government highly appraises the arduous efforts the African 
National Congress led by Nelson Mandela and some other black 
political forces have made in the struggle for racial equality 
and political settlement of the problems in South Africa. 
  He spoke highly of some important measures taken by South 
African president F.W. De Klerk and urged all parties in the 
country to implement the agreements already reached to ensure 
the general elections scheduled for April 27. 
  He added that as a permanent member of the United Nations 
Security Council, China will join in the international community 
to continue its commitment to the political settlement of the 
issues in South Africa.

  [Text] Nairobi, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today 
that "the world community should attach importance to Africa. 
Africa should not be neglected or marginalized." 
  Qian made the statement at a press conference held here 
today 
at the end of his visit to Kenya. 
  He said, "though Africa faces many difficulties, it also has 
its own strong points. Africa is not hopeless its future is 
bright." 
  On his current East Africa trip, he said he has come to see 
developments in the region by himself and promote bilateral 
relations between China and the countries he visits. 
  On the major problem facing African countries, Qian said 
African countries are not able to concentrate their efforts to 
develop economy, adding many problems cannot be solved without 
real development of economy. 
  He said Africa is under great political and economic 
pressures from the outside world. Under such circumstances 
there are turmoil and unrest in some African countries. 
"Without stability, it is hard for them to develop economy," he 
pointed out. 
  On the democratic process in South Africa, Qian expressed 
his 
hope that the planned non-racial general election on April 27 
will take place on schedule and a new democratic non-racial 
South Africa will be established. "China is willing to develop 
relations with a new South Africa in various fields on the basis 
of the principles of peaceful coexistence," Qian said. 
  As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
China and South Africa, Qian said South Africa should follow 
international regulations. "It should not have diplomatic 
relations with China and China's Taiwan province at the same 
time." 
  On the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and 
Lesotho, Qian said this has once again demonstrated there is 
only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of 
the Chinese territory, the government of the People's Republic 
of China is the sole legal government of China, and the attempt 
of the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, 
one Taiwan" has no popular support and will never succeed.

<F P=106> [By Chu Meng-yao (2612 1125 6674): "Beijing Readjusts Pace </F>
of Development To Maintain Stability; Central and Local 
Authorities Disagree About Faster or Lower Speed"] 
  [Text] Faced with the repercussions on mainland society 
caused by the series of reform measures which have "come out of 
the cage," the senior level of the CPC has once again stressed 
the importance of "stability." The relevant department has 
already tuned down its propaganda on economic development this 
year, and this kind of change has once again led to 
disagreements between the central and local authorities. 
  According to an authoritative and informed source in 
Beijing, 
since New Year's Day, the development principle publicized by 
the CPC has already been changed from the "six-character 
principle" of "sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, 
jiankang, 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660]" development at the 
end of last year, to the amended "16-character principle" of 
"grasping opportunity, deepening reform, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, cujin 
fazhan, baochi wending, 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 
7245, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 2170 4489 1353]." 
  According to information, the "16-character principle" is 
thorough and encompassing. It talks about reform on the one 
hand, and development on the other, and it talks about 
opportunity on the one hand, and stability on the other. 
Compared with the "six- character principle," it is thorough 
and concrete, more mature, less biased, and less extreme. The 
"six-character principle" emphasizes "rapid" development which 
is realized by "healthy" development. The 16-character 
instruction stresses "reform" and is eventually to be realized 
by the two characters of "stability," and its implication is 
clear without explanation. 
  The central leadership's rationale is that reform needs a 
relaxed environment, and that if the strings of economic 
operations are overstretched, this is not helpful to deepening 
reform. Reform has to be promoted, a certain development speed 
has to be maintained, inflation has to be checked, and social 
stability has to be maintained. The question of how to adjust 
relations among these four things is certainly a major topic . 
  Jiang Zemin's speech to the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th 
CPC Central Committee, carried by newspapers in Beijing 
yesterday, once again talked about "properly handling the 
relations between reform and development." In his speech he 
said that it is necessary to create a more relaxed environment 
for reform, and that the old ways of extensive operations, which 
is characterized by the blind pursuit of output value and 
expansion of the scale of investment, cannot be followed again. 
  In his New Year speech, Premier Li Peng lowered the 
development speed target to 8-9 percent, and repeatedly stressed 
the importance of stability; this in fact fixed the tone for 
"cooling down the temperature" this year. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has talked about the economic 
situation on many occasions and has always reminded local 
officials "not to act too hastily," not to compare speed, and 
not to blindly make investments and randomly launch projects. 
He has always been critical of the "craze for development 
zones" and "craze for real estate," and he does not agree with 
the "extraordinary" and "high- speed" proposals. 
  Li Lanqing, another vice premier, said recently when 
inspecting Zhejiang and Shanghai: "A new series of important 
reform measures will be announced this year, and we must pay 
special attention to maintaining social stability, check the 
upsurge of prices, and control the scale of investment in fixed 
assets to reduce risks and create a good external environment 
for expediting reform. The inflation problem must receive 
special attention." 
  On 16 January, the government's RENMIN RIBAO carried on the 
front page with a major headline a commentator's article, 
entitled: "Prevent Blind Development of Real Estate." The 
article criticized some localities, departments, and units who 
are presently authorizing projects unduly without observing the 
relevant state regulations, and some even acted in their own 
ways and blindly launched projects: "the craze for real estate 
has reemerged." It is alleged that the spirit of the article 
came mainly from Zhongnanhai. 
  However, what is clearly opposite to the attitude of the 
central leadership is that local officials have never ceased 
calling for "vigorous work and rapid growth." Shanghai leaders 
have said on many occasions that to Shanghai, low-speed 
development equates to no development and that Shanghai must 
grasp the opportunity granted to it by history and utilize 
various conditions to expedite its own development itself. 
  The front page of BEIJING RIBAO on 12 January carried, with 
a 
major headline, a speech by Chen Xitong, the party secretary of 
Beijing Municipality. The speech was entitled "Boldly 
Emancipating the Mind." He said that to establish a new system, 
it is necessary to "boldly charge forward, to blaze a new trail, 
and to take risks"; and to continue emancipating the minds, it 
is also necessary to "boldly charge forward, to blaze a new 
trail, and to take risks." 
  Chen Xitong said that only by emancipating the mind can new 
ways of thinking be found and bold measures be taken. If one 
fears the wolves in front and the tigers behind, like a woman 
with bound feet who dares not do this and that, doing minor 
things but not big things, then one cannot walk at a big pace. 
  Chen Xitong urged his subordinates to "stretch your arms and 
work vigorously, get started, and run quickly," to expedite 
reform and opening up.

<F P=106> [By Yueh Feng (1417 7364): "Words of Complaint Uttered at </F>
the National Economic Work Conference"] 
  [Text] The open discontent among representatives at the 
National Economic Work Conference shows that acute 
contradictions exist between local and central authorities. The 
rhetoric that "the whole country is a game of chess," which was 
stressed in the past, can no longer be heard. The dissenting 
tendency of the local-lord economy, as well as the structural 
imbalance caused by the unbalanced developments in various 
localities, are potential troubles in future economy. 
<H5>  Suggestions From "Varying Opinions" </H5>
  Seven, eight, nine, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15... 
  Is this a game of figures or what? 
  These are not ordinary figures; they are supposed to be the 
economic growth rates on the mainland in 1994. 
  Why are there so many figures? They represent the different 
opinions on economic growth held by various quarters of 
Communist China: The Political Bureau says it should be 10 
percent; a majority of members [as published] say it cannot be 
lower than 10 percent; the State Council's preliminary plan is 
that it should be 8-9 percent; the State Planning Commission's 
report says it should be 13 percent, and if the problem of power 
can be solved, the growth rate can be fixed at 14-15 percent; 
the State Council's Economic and Trade Commission suggests a 9 
percent growth; the State Commission for Economic Restructuring 
suggests an 8 percent growth; the report by the economics 
development under the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee holds that it should be 7-8 percent.... 
  The above-mentioned are the estimates by the relevant 
central 
departments, whereas provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions have their own policies, and they struggle hard for the 
best growth rates according to their own "national situation." 
Among 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, one 
province and one municipality suggest that their own growth 
rates should be higher than 15 percent, while 17 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions such as Guangdong, 
Jiangsu, and Shanghai suggest that their own growth rates should 
be higher than 12 percent, whereas other 10 provinces and 
autonomous regions suggest that their own growth rates should be 
higher than 10 percent. 
  Through these suggestions from "varying opinions," we can 
see 
that up to now, the CPC authorities still have no decision on 
the economic growth rate for 1994. 
<H5>  "Macroeconomic Regulation and Control" Ends </H5>
  The National Economic Work Conference, which was held from 1 
to 4 December and presided over by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, made 
an assessment of the financial and economic conditions for the 
economic development in the new year. For the first time the 
conference made public the internal structure of the economic 
development on the mainland, as well as changes, and those are 
things which the outside world had been guessing and assessing. 
However, the figures are incomplete and sometimes contradictory. 
  What is noteworthy is that Jiang Zemin disclosed at the 
conference that the pace of reform in 1994 will be very big. He 
said that it will be a year in which an unprecedented number of 
reform measures will be announced compared with the past 10 
years or so, and he used the slogan of "sustained, healthy, 
rapid, and good" economic development. This means that Zhu 
Rongji's measures to carry out "macroeconomic regulation and 
control" have come to a halt, and what follows would be a new 
round of "great leap forward." 
  Since July 1993 when Zhu Rongji decisively implemented a 
series of reform measures, the over-heated economy on the 
mainland has cooled down, and the very chaotic financial market 
has returned to normal. Under this condition, the CPC 
authorities cannot wait to accelerate the economic train, and 
the "theory of opportunity" holds sway. 
  In fact, under the current system, after more than 10 years 
of reform, the mainland's economy has not been able to jump out 
of the strange cycle whereby "when it is let go, it becomes 
chaotic; when it becomes chaotic, it is tightened up; when it is 
tightened up, it dies." Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic regulation 
and control policy lasted for only a few months, and this has 
surprised economists, whose observations hold that there has to 
be one or two years of "recuperation" before the economy on the 
mainland can embark upon the road of healthy development. 
<H3>  Many Provinces and Municipalities Are Experiencing Seriously 
Unbalanced Economic Developments </H3>
  However, the current macroeconomic regulation and control 
has 
caused great losses to those who have vested interests. 
Utilizing their privileges, they engaged in real estate and 
stock market speculation with all their money, and they reaped 
huge profits. When the regulation and control was suddenly 
implemented, they lost their means to make money, and some even 
faced the danger of bankruptcy. Some commentators pointed out 
that Zhu Rongji could not get to the bureaucrat-businessmen, who 
know many tricks, but it is surprising to see the regulation and 
control becoming ineffective in just a few months. 
  But we want to return to our topic. Are there any 
conditions for the mainland's economy to grow rapidly? As the 
saying goes, "a skyscraper has to start on the ground floor." 
The development structure on the mainland has already had a 
problem of serious imbalance, and at the economic work 
conference the commissions and offices under the State Council, 
the Auditing Administration, and the General Administration of 
Customs released some information and figures which showed an 
alarming situation. The information revealed that in 12 
provinces and autonomous regions the structure and proportion of 
economic development showed a serious unbalance, and that in 16 
provinces and autonomous regions the total economic returns on 
production did not reach the state's target. 
<H3>  The External Flow of Funds Reached 150 Billion Yuan in 10 
Months </H3>
  Other worrisome figures include: 
  --In 1992 the debt chain among enterprises was 110 billion 
yuan. In the first quarter of 1993 it was 42 billion yuan, in 
the second quarter of 1993 it was 35 billion yuan, and in the 
third quarter of 1993 it was 60 billion yuan. 
  --In 1992 the external flow of funds was 30 billion yuan. 
In 1993, up to October, it exceeded 150 billion yuan; at the 
end of October, the state's foreign exchange reserve was $33 
billion, and disposable foreign exchange was $20 billion. 
  --The state received less revenue, and in 1992 the decrease 
was 33 percent. In 1993, from the first to third quarter, the 
decrease was 38.5 percent. 
  --Regarding the goods and materials which were smuggled in 
or 
imported unlawfully in 1992, it amounted to $20 billion based on 
a preliminary estimate. In 1993, from the first to third 
quarter, it amounted to $30 billion, and about 55 percent of the 
imported cars were smuggled in. This year, the unfavorable 
balance between import and export will exceed $12 billion. 
<H5>  Finished Products in Stock Amounted to 148 Billion Yuan </H5>
  In addition, the conference also revealed for the first time 
in concrete terms the alarming losses of enterprises on the 
mainland: 
  --At the end of October 1993, the machines and equipment and 
whole sets of industrial facilities which ceased working across 
the country were valued at 250 billion yuan. Abandoned and idle 
factory floors totalled 6.5 million square meters, some 16 
million idle and unnecessary workers loitered in factories, and 
over 26 million workers could be laid off for streamlining 
purpose. 
  --The finished and semifinished products in warehouses 
across 
the country were valued at more than 180 billion yuan, while 
light industrial and finished or semifinished handicraft 
products were valued at 68 billion yuan. 
  --The normal utilization rate of imported machines and 
facilities was 62 percent, and economic returns was only about 
70 percent.

<H3>  The 16-Character "Sincere Remark" Raises a Great Deal of 
Opinions </H3>
  The economic work conference this time also exhibited 
another 
unusual phenomenon, that is, in the beginning of the conference, 
the persons in charge of various localities remained silent. 
Obviously, it was some sort of silent protest against the 
central leadership by the "local economic lords." 
  After detecting this kind of subtle emotion, Jiang Zemin, Li 
Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Zou Jiahua came out personally to soothe 
them, stressing that they should "talk freely about whatever is 
on their minds, offer whatever opinions they have, make whatever 
suggestions they like, and air whatever grievances they harbor." 
  This 16-character "sincere remark" really worked wonders, 
and 
it suddenly aroused the enthusiasm of the representatives to 
talk, hence complaints, discontents, opinions, suggestions, and 
examinations were poured into the conference. The CPC Central 
Committee General Office and the State Council General Office 
made a "general summation," which summarized the contents into 
20 points in the newsletters they later issued, and the title 
was "Some of the Opinions and Suggestions Made by 
Representatives at the Central Leadership Work Conference." 
These 20 points are: 
  Local Authorities Make 20 Points Accusing the Central 
Leadership of a Series of Mistakes 
  1. When central leading comrades inspect localities, they 
give instructions and suggestions, without giving concrete 
teachings. 
  2. In actual work, localities find it difficult to 
thoroughly understand and grasp the policies and regulations 
announced by the central leadership. 
  3. The instructions by the central leadership, central 
leaders, central inspection teams, central on-the-spot teams, 
and central work teams are not clear, often leading to conflicts. 
  4. Regarding economic work, the direction in which reform is 
to be carried out and the scope of the opening up, the central 
leadership still does not have a set of principles and policies 
which are scientific, relatively complete, comparatively 
systematic, and in accordance with the nation's situation. 
  5. Some central leaders have failed to promptly solve 
problems arising from economic development, reform, and opening 
up. They are not mentally prepared for the problems which are 
likely to arise. 
<H5>  "The Central Leadership Has a Bigger Responsibility" </H5>
  6. Central leaders are seemingly complacent with the 
achievements and progress in economic construction, reform, and 
opening up. They have not made summations promptly and some 
problems have emerged as a result -- the over-heated phenomenon 
of the economy became very obvious as early as November 1992. 
  7. Some comrades in the central leadership and some central 
departments put undue emphasis on vigorously creating conditions 
for importing foreign funds, without paying attention to whether 
those funds have arrived on time or not, or to the facilities 
set up by those funds, or to the technology used by 
foreign-funded firms, or to the distribution of foreign-funded 
firms (only 18.2 percent of foreign funds agreed upon by 
contracts and agreements have arrived on time). 
  8. For a long time the central leadership has no overall 
planning for the development of communications, transportation, 
railways, roads, ports, power, energy, and water resources, as 
well as for coordinated economic development. There are 
problems being discovered every year, but the main problems are 
not put on the agenda for solution. 
<H3>  Loss of Control Over Investment in Capital Construction Is 
Approved by the Central Leadership </H3>
  11. The problem of IOU's in the rural areas has not been 
solved since 1989, and the rural problem has become more acute, 
the main reason being that the polices announced by the central 
leadership have not be actually implemented. 
  12. Local protectionism is very serious in the regions which 
have rapid economic development and good economic foundations 
and conditions. The central leadership has not corrected it 
promptly, and this is not helpful to regional cooperation. 
  13. The scale of capital construction is large, and the 
amount of investment is large, leading to loss of control. Many 
loans are approved by the central leadership, or reported by 
local authorities to the central leadership, which then gives 
approval. 
  14. The rise of living indexes in most areas stays above 15 
percent, causing conflicts between the people and government. 
Solving the inflation problem relies on the timely 
macroregulation and control by the central leadership. 
  15. Localities think that macroregulation and control by the 
central leadership is necessary but a bit late, and that the 
scope of macroregulation and control is not clear, causing 
ambiguities in local economic reforms. 
  16. The power and scope of legislation delegated by the 
central leadership to localities, are not clear. The central 
leadership must maintain long continuity of policies and 
systems, so as to benefit industrial development in localities. 
<H5>  Many Units and Enterprises Are in a State of Anarchy </H5>
  17. The two leading groups -- party and government -- in a 
locality often cannot coordinate well in leading the work in 
economic construction, reform, and opening up. The central 
leadership should give clear policy guidance. 
  18. There is a serious shortage of funds for scientific and 
technological development, and the number of scientists and 
technician who quit or change jobs every year exceeds the number 
of new recruits in the science and technology contingent; 
although the central leadership understands the seriousness of 
the situation, it does not have concrete measures to solve the 
problem. 
  19. Localities, enterprises, and nonproductive units 
continue to issue shares and bonds, the central leadership 
should formulate a legal system and a set of regulations to 
exercise control. 
  20. Quite a large number of the cadres in local party and 
government units, and the cadres in state-owned enterprises, 
face streamlining and cutbacks in personnel, however, no proper 
arrangements have been made based on a standardized policy. As 
a result, serious anarchy and passive emotion emerged in units 
and enterprises. 
  Judging from the "summation" of the above-mentioned speeches 
by the representatives, acute contradictions exist between the 
local and central authorities. The rhetoric that "the whole 
country is a game of chess," which was stressed in the past, can 
no longer be heard, and the dissenting tendency of the 
local-lord economy, as well as the structural imbalance caused 
by the unbalanced developments in various localities, have 
already laid down potential trouble in economic development in 
the future.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Prevent Blind Property and Real </F>
Estate Development"] 
  [Text] Strengthening and improving macroregulation and 
control, vigorously adjusting the economic structure, and 
maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy means that while we must maintain a reasonable 
scale of fixed-assets investment, we must continue with strict 
controls to keep the scale from growing too rapidly, and we must 
improve the investment mix. However, capital construction 
across the country remains large in scale. Departments and 
units in some places have exceeded the boundary of their 
authority in approval matters and have flouted the relevant 
state decrees. Some have gone their own way, launching projects 
in a blind fashion, with the result that the "property fad" is 
rearing its head again, creating a very negative impact on 
national economic development and efforts to curb inflation. 
This we must view with great seriousness. Preventing blind 
development in property and real estate will be the focus of a 
reduction in the scale of fixed-assets investment and an 
improvement of the investment mix this year. We expect to see 
greater and better efforts in this regard, which will produce 
results early this year. 
  Property and real estate is a new industry in our country. 
It has to develop healthily. The healthy development of the 
property and real estate industry is marked by a reasonable 
proportion of investment in other industries and should be 
commensurate with the supply capacity and market demand for 
capital and building materials. Based on our national 
situation, fixed-assets investment must focus on infrastructural 
facilities and industries such as agriculture, transport, 
communications, and energy in order to break the constraints of 
"bottlenecks" created by the relative backwardness of these 
industries on national economic development. At the same time, 
we must support the development of key capital and 
technology-intensive industries, promote upgrading the 
production structure, and enhance the competitiveness of 
products in international markets. If large amounts of social 
capital flow into the property and real estate industry and it 
is allowed to develop blindly, the development of infrastructure 
and industries and the revitalization of key manufacturing 
industries will be seriously affected, and eventually the 
progress of our country's modernization will be hampered. 
  To maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of 
the national economy, we must prevent blind expansion in the 
property and real estate industry. First of all, measures must 
be adopted to put a tight lid on the building of luxury hotels, 
office buildings, luxury villas, holiday resorts, and high-class 
amusement facilities. These building projects require 
large-scale investment, and, moreover, demand for them has grown 
soft. Vying and competing with each other, blind development 
and building is bound to result in serious wastage. Second, 
strengthen investment management. Property and real estate 
investment must be incorporated in fixed- assets investment and 
credit plans and must not go beyond these plans. Planning and 
management departments should reject property projects which are 
not incorporated and banks should refuse them loans. Third, 
strengthen the management of development and construction. 
Regardless of size, property and real estate developments must 
meet the requirements of urban planning and must be handled 
according to capital construction procedures. Land must be used 
with extreme care and reason, and scrutiny and approval must be 
done according to the relevant land use rules and regulations. 
Fourth, conscientiously enforce regulations on levying 
value-added tax on property and real estate and regulating the 
property market. 
  To facilitate the healthy development of the property and 
real estate industry, it is necessary to correctly adjust the 
investment mix in the property and real estate industry. 
Solving housing problem for urban residents, especially 
families with special difficulties, and renovating dilapidated 
houses should be the key tasks in property and real estate 
development. These should be pursued in a down-to-earth manner 
and in accordance with the relevant state decrees, and thus we 
will render some practical services for the masses. We should 
go as far as our ability permits but pursue the job to the 
utmost of our ability; and we should pursue reform of the urban 
residential housing system under the state's centralized 
planning to achieve a home ownership scheme.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangqing: "Solid Economic Environment Will Sustain </F>
Growth"] 
  [Text] China's economy will maintain sustained and rapid 
growth this year thanks to its solid economic environment. 
Owing to 15 years of economic reforms, China has witnessed 
significant economic growth that has laid a solid base for the 
further development of the country's economy. 
  As the world's most populous country, China owns a huge 
domestic market. With incomes rising, the domestic market has 
strongly stimulated the country's economy. 
  In 1992, the Chinese put 32.7 per cent of their total income 
into banks. And last year the figure was even higher. 
  The high savings ratio has enabled banks to lend to projects 
in the country's infrastructure projects. 
  To reform the existing economic structure, China will pour a 
large amount of investment into its infrastructure and basic 
industries. 
  With improvement in the nation's economy, foreigners have 
become more interested in investing in China. 
  They are bringing with them capital, resources, science and 
technology, and management expertise. 
  Foreign funds have become a vital ingredient to the 
country's 
rapid growth. 
  China now has a large pool of high level managerial, 
scientific and educational personnel who are working to build up 
the country. 
  With the country's rapid economic and scientific 
development, 
the fear of native talent leaving for overseas opportunities has 
diminished. 
  After a decade of market reforms and enterprise 
restructuring, large and medium-sized State-owned firms will 
play a more important role in the country's booming economy. 
  The co-existence of State-owned enterprises, foreign-funded 
companies and private firms has also laid a sound basis for the 
country's rapid economic growth. 
  Although great achievements have been made during the past 
decade, agriculture is still one of China's weakest sectors. 
  Yet the future is bright for one of the country's primary 
industries. 
  The government should emphasize agriculture while 
establishing the market-oriented system. 
  Laws and regulations on farm production should be put into 
effect and perfected to ensure reform is effective in the 
countryside. 
  And more money should be channeled into agriculture. 
Likewise, rural industries should be encouraged to expand 
production and improve efficiency. 
  Last year China registered the world's highest economic 
growth rate--13 per cent. 
  However, the overheated economy overshadowed several sectors 
last year. Over-investment in real estate and development zones 
caused a disorder in the country's economy. 
  Since last June, the central government has adopted an 
austerity package to control growth. 
  The measure has been effective in stopping wild speculation 
and the extending of risky loans. Financial and economic order 
has also been improved. 
  The austerity measure has enabled China to enjoy a "soft 
landing" rather than a sudden brake. 
  The government plans a 9 per cent economic growth this year 
and hopes to keep prices from rising more than 10 per cent. 
  To achieve this goal, the country should speed up reforms in 
the investment structure. The scale of capital investment 
should be controlled. 
  The industrial structure and production scale need to be 
regulated to improve product quality. 
  Quality and marketable products should be developed and 
distributed. 
  Commercial departments should be encouraged to tap the 
potential of rural markets to boost sales of industrial products. 
  And production, marketing, storage and transportation of 
agricultural produce and by-products should be strengthened. 
  It is important for the government to control price hikes of 
daily necessities to safeguard sustained, healthy and rapid 
economic growth. 
  The government should be cautious when it increases employee 
wages so as to avoid inflation that may result from rising 
incomes. 
  Beside maintaining strong momentum of economic development, 
efficiency of enterprises should be highlighted. 
  The country should speed up turning the traditional planned 
economic system into a market one. 
  Enterprises should base decisions on market factors. 
  As living conditions of the Chinese people greatly improve 
and consuming habits of common people have changed, it is 
imperative to study the market so as to maintain the balance 
between supply and demand.

<F P=106> [Article by the Modern Enterprise System Investigation and </F>
Study Group: "Establish a Modern Enterprise System That Is in 
Keeping With the Socialist Market Economic Structure"] 
  [Text] I. The Modern Enterprise System Is the 
Foundation of the Socialist Market Economic Structure 
  1. Enterprises are the market's basic economic units 
and are the main body of competition. Establishing the status 
of enterprises as the main body is an essential question in the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure. 
While erecting a macroscopic framework for the market economic 
structure, we must reshape the foundation for the market 
economic structure and establish a modern enterprise system that 
is in keeping with the socialist market economic structure. 
  2. Enterprise reform has always been central to the 
entire economic structure reform. Over the past 15 years, 
enterprise reform has basically proceeded in keeping with the 
idea of separating ownership and the right of management, 
expanding the self-managing power of enterprises, reforming the 
forms of management, orienting enterprises to the market, and 
invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
The fact that the Regulations on Changing the Management 
Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People 
was put into practice has further ensured that enterprises have 
self-management power and has driven the reform of other 
aspects. The Regulations on the Supervision of the Assets of 
State-Owned Enterprises to be introduced soon will define 
property rights and responsibilities, ensure the supervisory 
function, and straighten out the property rights relationships, 
laying the groundwork for enterprises to enter the market. 
  3. Following the deep-going development of China's economic 
structure reform, the underlying causes of the inadequate 
vitality of state-owned enterprises has further been exposed, 
the main ones being the undefined property rights relationships, 
the irrationality of the organizational system, and the fact 
that the management system is unscientific. Therefore, 
the further deepening of enterprise reform necessitates 
the tackling of deep-seated contradictions, a change from policy 
readjustment, whose main contents are power delegation and the 
concession of interests, to focussing on innovations in the 
enterprise system, exploring an effective method of combining 
public ownership and market economy, further liberating and 
developing productive forces, and consolidating and perfecting 
the socialist system. 
  4. The modern enterprise system is the product of market 
economy and large-scale socialized production. It is a fruit of 
civilization created by men in the course of practice and is the 
common wealth of mankind. It is necessary to absorb and use the 
beneficial experiences of developed countries around the world 
in light of China's reality and establish a Chinese-style modern 
enterprise system that conforms to China's national conditions 
and that is in keeping with international practice. 
  5. The modern enterprise system China is going to 
establish is a new type of enterprise system that meets the 
requirements of socialist market economy, that takes the 
standardized and complete legal entity system [qi ye fa ren zhi 
0120 2814 3127 0086 0455] as the mainstay, and that takes the 
limited liability system as the core. Its basic 
characteristics are: Government administration and enterprise 
management are separated, property rights relationships are 
clearly defined, the ownership of the state-owned assets of 
enterprises is held by the state, and enterprises have corporate 
property rights and are independent legal entities that operate 
independently and assume sole responsibility for profits and 
losses. Enterprises, as legal entities, possess all rights over 
the assets formed by investments from various sources, including 
the State, and become legal entities that enjoy rights and 
shoulder responsibilities under civil law. They assume 
responsibility to investors for maintaining and increasing the 
value of assets. The investors, as owners, enjoy rights and 
interests commensurate with their shares of capital investment 
in enterprises and assume limited liabilities. Enterprises 
organize production and operations in keeping with market needs 
and aim at improving labor productivity and economic returns, 
and the government does not directly interfere with their 
managerial activities. Enterprises are to formulate rules, 
establish a scientific and standardized leadership structure and 
organizational and management system, and coordinate the 
relationships between the owners, managers, and staff and 
workers, thus forming a management mechanism that integrates 
encouragement and regulation. Enterprises operate in accordance 
with the law, have taxes levied on them according to 
regulations, accept government supervision, and meet the state's 
macroscopic regulation and control. 
  6. In establishing a modern enterprise system, it is 
necessary to adhere to the status of the public-owned economy as 
the mainstay and to the leading role of the state-owned 
economy and allow the simultaneous development of all 
economic sectors. Large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises are the pillars of China's economy and focusing on 
pursuing the modern enterprise system in these enterprises is a 
positive exploration and is of great significance to promoting 
the deepening of reform and to establishing a socialist market 
economic structure. Enterprise reform whose contents are to 
establish a modern enterprise system will continue to be central 
to establishing a socialist market economic structure. 
  II. Straighten Out the Property Rights Relationships 
and Perfect the Legal Entity System 
  7. In order to establish a modern enterprise system, it is 
necessary to perfect China's legal entity system. Under the 
traditional planned economic structure, state-owned enterprises, 
as the subsidiaries of state administrative organizations, did 
not have the status of independent legal persons. The state was 
the sole investor and competition was out of the question. 
Although the state has, in the course of practicing the planned 
commodity economy, established the legal entity system in the 
form of law, it is an incomplete legal entity system. Although 
nominally state- owned enterprises have the status of legal 
persons, they have no independent property rights which 
are indispensable to legal persons and they have difficulty 
establishing a property restricting mechanism. In these 
circumstances, they only assume responsibility for profits but 
not for losses, and the state still assumes unlimited liability 
for enterprises and enterprises are still not real independent 
legal persons. 
  8. The state-owned assets of enterprises are owned by 
the whole people, that is, by the state. The State Council 
exercises the right of ownership of the assets on behalf of the 
state. To state- owned enterprises, the essence of the legal 
entity system is to confirm that the state possesses ownership 
of the property and that enterprises possess independent legal 
property rights and accordingly enjoy rights and shoulder 
responsibilities under civil law. Confirming their legal 
property rights will continue to change enterprises from having 
someone assume responsibility to having the capability of 
assuming responsibility and achieve the integration of their 
civil rights capacity and the capacity for action, forming in 
the market thousands of legal entities that assume sole 
responsibility for profits and losses. 
  9. In order to confirm the legal property rights, it is 
necessary to straighten out property rights relationships and 
separate the ownership of investors from the property 
rights of legal persons. Under some conditions, the ownership of 
investors is reflected in their possession of stock rights, that 
is, as shareholders, they enjoy such rights as profiting from 
the assets, choosing managers, participating in the making of 
major policy decisions, and transferring stock rights. 
Investors cannot manipulate the part of a legal person's 
property that belongs to themselves. They can only exercise 
their rights as shareholders to influence the behavior of the 
enterprise, but cannot directly interfere with the managerial 
activities of the enterprise. The legal property rights 
are reflected in the fact that enterprises enjoy the rights of 
occupying, using, profiting from, and disposing of the property 
of legal persons and assume responsibility for their own 
managerial activities with independent property. The 
ownership and legal property rights of investors have been 
confirmed by law and are protected by law and are inviolable. 
  10. For state-owned enterprises, confirming the legal 
property rights will not change the state's status as the owner 
and the only change is the mode by which the state manages 
state-owned assets, that is, a change from the management of 
assets in physical form to the management of assets in value 
form. What is important is that both the value increases of and 
returns on the state-owned assets of enterprises belong to the 
state. The state assumes responsibility for the business risks 
of enterprises limited to only the amount of its capital 
investment. Moreover, by holding state-owned stock rights, the 
state can expand the scope of control and readjustment of 
state-owned assets, that is, control a larger amount of capital 
with a certain proportion of capital. It can also achieve the 
rational flow of state-owned assets and the optimum allocation 
of resources through the exchange of property rights, this being 
conducive to the structural readjustment of the stock of 
state-owned assets and to maintaining and increasing their value. 
  11. When enterprises possess the legal property rights, we 
should ensure that they assume sole responsibility for profits 
and losses by establishing the capital fund system and the 
assets management responsibility system. We should encourage 
enterprises to manipulate, utilize, and handle their own assets, 
and to vitalize the stock of assets and achieve an effective 
increase in value. In this way we should put an end to the 
inseparability of government and enterprises functions and lay a 
groundwork for enterprises to get rid of the status of 
subsidiaries of government administrative institutions. 
  12. We should straighten out the property rights 
relationships and perfect the legal entity system, creating 
conditions for the effective integration of public ownership and 
market economy. On the one hand, the state possesses 
ownership and thus ensures the nature of the public ownership of 
property. On the other hand, by establishing legal 
property rights, enterprises will become real commodity 
producers and managers that operate independently and that 
assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. This 
has shaped a diversified economic main body that meets the 
requirements for the operation of the market economic structure, 
is conducive to bringing into play the fundamental role of 
market economy in resource allocation under the state's 
macroscopic regulation and control, and enables state-owned 
assets to operate effectively under market economic conditions 
and to have their value maintained and increased during their 
flow. Following the flowing and reorganization of property 
rights, all sorts of ownerships intermingle and economic units 
whose assets are owned by a mixture of parties will gradually 
increase. As far as the whole country is concerned, different 
regions and different trades and industries can differ in the 
role of public ownership as the mainstay in their national 
economy. The role of public ownership as the mainstay is mainly 
embodied in such aspects as the dominant position of public 
assets in aggregate social assets, the public-owned economy's 
control over the lifeblood of the national economy, and its 
influence on and guiding role in economic development. 
  III. The Organizational System of Modern 
Enterprises 
  13. In keeping with the requirements of market economy, the 
organizational patterns of modern enterprises should not be 
delineated by the nature of their ownership, but should be 
delineated in accordance with the forms of composition of their 
assets and the legal responsibilities they assume. They are 
generally categorized as sole proprietorship, partnership, and 
corporation internationally. The first two are enterprises of 
natural persons in which the investors assume unlimited 
liability, whereas the corporation is a corporate enterprise 
which mainly includes the limited liability company and the 
limited liability stock company in which the investor assumes 
limited liability commensurate with his amount of capital 
investment. In China, in addition to the above forms of 
organization, there is the company funded solely by the state, 
the state-owned state-run enterprise, and the cooperative stock 
enterprise. The corporation is an important form in the 
organization of modern enterprises and has effectively separated 
the ownership of investors from the property rights of the legal 
person and has such characteristics as having wide sources of 
funds pooling, limited investment risk, and a scientific 
organizational system. It is typical and representative of the 
organizational patterns of modern enterprises. 
  14. Corporations have already formed a complete 
organizational system in the development of market economy. The 
most obvious characteristic is that through the 
corporation's authority institution, decisionmaking and 
management institution, and supervisory institution, the owners, 
managers, and producers form mutually restricting relationships, 
whereby they are all independent and their rights and 
responsibilities are clearly defined. Moreover, this can be 
established and achieved through the law and the articles of 
incorporation. This organizational system both gives the 
managers full independent rights and conscientiously safeguards 
the rights and interests of the owners while being able to bring 
the initiative of the producers into play at the same time. 
  15. We can generally consider the organizational composition 
of a corporation as follows: 
  -- The meeting of shareholders is the institution of 
supreme authority of a company. It has the power to choose 
and dismiss the members of the board of directors and the board 
of supervisors, formulate and amend the articles of 
incorporation, and examine and approve the company's major 
matters, including its fiscal budget and actual budget, 
investments, and profit distribution. 
  -- The board of directors is the managing and 
policymaking institution of a company. Its functions are 
to execute the resolutions adopted at the meeting of 
shareholders, make policy decisions about production and 
management for the company, and appoint and dismiss the 
company's general manager. Its members comprise representatives 
of shareholders and representatives of other quarters. 
The chairman of the board is elected by the board of 
directors and is generally the legal representative of the 
company. The board of directors makes policy decisions 
collectively. Each director has one vote, and decisions are 
approved by a simple majority. Members of the board of 
directors have to sign their votes for the record and assume 
responsibility for them. This is good for policy decisions to 
be democratic and scientific and examines the directors' 
capability for making policy decisions at the same time. 
  The company general manager is in charge of the 
company's daily operational and managerial activities and takes 
on overall leadership of the company's production and 
management. He discharges his functions in accordance with 
the articles of incorporation and as authorized by the board of 
directors and is responsible to the board of directors. 
The board of directors invites the general manager to 
serve rather than having him appointed by the higher 
authorities. The personnel and salary relationships of 
directors and managers are separated from the state's 
administrative system. 
  -- The board of supervisors is the company's 
supervisory institution. It comprises shareholders and 
representatives of staff and workers according to certain 
proportions and is responsible to the meeting of shareholders. 
The board of supervisors supervises, in accordance with law and 
with the articles of incorporation, the activities of the board 
of directors and managers in the course of their discharging 
their functions and prevents them from abusing their powers. 
The board of supervisors has the right to examine and check the 
company's financial status, safeguarding the company's interests 
and the legitimacy of the company's business activities. The 
board of supervisors can put forward proposals concerning the 
appointment and dismissal of the directors and managers and 
about their reward and punishment. In order to ensure 
independence of supervision, the supervisors must not assume 
managerial or supervisory posts with the company. 
  16. There can be some flexibility in the organizational 
pattern of companies. Considering the convenience of the 
structural convergence and operation of enterprises funded 
solely by the state we can use another kind of organizational 
structure, that is, setting up the board of supervisors outside 
the company and above the board of directors. The board of 
supervisors comprises representatives selected by government 
supervisory departments; authoritative economic, financial, 
legal, and technical experts appointed by government supervisory 
departments; and representatives of staff and workers according 
to certain proportions. The chairman of the board of 
supervisors is appointed by government organizations. The 
functions of the board of supervisors are: To appoint and 
dismiss the members of the board of directors and the general 
manager and make decisions about rewards and punishments; 
supervise the company's management and the maintenance and 
increase of its assets; and examine the enterprise's financial 
report and major proposals concerning investment, financing, and 
profit distribution without exercising the enterprise's right to 
make policies concerning management. Using this pattern is 
favorable to enterprises converging with the Regulations on the 
Supervision and Management of the Assets of State-Owned 
Enterprises and is favorable to staff and workers participating 
in the management of the enterprise. 
  Moreover, it is favorable to the reform of government 
departments in the future. Furthermore, we can generally 
combine the board of directors and the group of managers (their 
numbers should not be too large), that is, the board of 
directors is the managing group of the company and the chairman 
of the board acts also as the general manager and vice chairmen 
act as vice general managers. This method is favorable to 
enterprises converging with the factory director (manager) 
responsibility system as provided for by the Enterprise Law and 
protects the incentive of the factory directors (managers) of 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
  The majority of enterprises that have not practiced the 
corporate system should continue to stick to and perfect the 
factory director (manager) responsibility system. 
  17. In establishing a Chinese-style modern enterprise 
system, 
it is necessary to bring into play the role of the 
enterprise's party committee as the political core and 
ensure that the policies and principles of supervising the party 
and state are implemented. It is necessary to improve the 
structure of the leading group of the enterprise's party 
committee and increase the proportion of party members in the 
administrative leadership. Party and government leaders can 
take over each other's posts alternately, and they can assume 
party and government posts at the same time if they meet the 
requirements. The institution establishment and personnel 
allocation of the enterprise's party committee should proceed in 
such a way that they are competent and highly efficient and that 
the enterprise can make independent decisions. The party 
committee of an enterprise should pay good attention to 
fostering the party and spiritual civilization and pay good 
attention to ensuring supervision while rallying around the 
enterprise's central task. As for an enterprise practicing the 
corporate system, its party committee leaders can join the board 
of directors and the board of supervisors through legal 
procedures and thus participate in making policy decisions 
concerning the enterprise's major issues. 
  18. Instituting democratic management by staff and 
workers is one of the characteristics of the modern enterprise 
system. It is necessary to enhance the sense of 
responsibility of staff and workers as masters of their own 
affairs and bring into play their initiative and creativity. In 
state-owned and state-run enterprises and companies funded 
solely by the state it is necessary to bring into play the role 
of the representative assembly of staff and workers and the role 
of trade unions and strengthen democratic management. In 
enterprises that practice the corporate system, their trade 
unions communicate the opinions and demands of their staff and 
workers to the board of directors and the board of supervisors 
and safeguard the legitimate rights of staff and workers. 
Representatives of staff and workers should be organized and 
recommended for joining the board of supervisors to participate 
in the supervision of enterprise operations and management. 
<H5>  IV. The Modern Enterprise Management System </H5>
  19. A scientific enterprise management system is an 
important 
part of the modern enterprise system. Proceeding from 
overcoming the weaknesses in China's existing enterprise 
management system and improving enterprises' economic returns, 
we should establish a modern enterprise management system 
with the emphasis on reforming enterprises' structural 
establishment and their labor use system, wage system, and 
financial and accounting systems, and institute a strict 
responsibility system. 
  20. The structural establishment should be decided by 
enterprises themselves in keeping with the characteristics of 
production and management and with the needs of market 
competition and in line with the principles of clearly defining 
functions, rationalizing the structure, using competent 
personnel, and keeping rights commensurate with 
responsibilities. It is necessary to emphatically stress 
management systems, including development, quality, business and 
sales, finance, and information, and improve the decisionmaking 
expertise, enterprise quality, and economic returns. Large 
enterprises and enterprise groups can gradually form the 
management patterns of investment centers, profit centers, and 
cost centers. 
  21. Establish a modern enterprise labor employment 
system. Reform the method of the state's directly managing 
labor employment and change the employer from the state to the 
enterprise. Enterprises enjoy the right to employ their 
own labor independently according to law and laborers have the 
right to choose their own careers independently according to 
law. The employment contract is the basic form of 
establishing and readjusting labor relationships. The labor 
relationship between an enterprise and a laborer is established 
when the two parties sign the employment contract of their own 
accord and the contract is the basis for safeguarding their 
legitimate rights and interests. Eliminate the identity 
boundaries between staff and workers and between cadres and 
workers within an enterprise, between different forms of 
employment, and between enterprises employing different forms of 
ownership. It is necessary to establish and perfect the social 
security system and the labor force market as soon as possible 
and form an employment mechanism for an employing unit and a 
laborer to choose each other and rationally flow to each 
other. At present, it is necessary to continue to proceed 
with the reform of the labor system whose main body is the 
all-personnel labor contract system and make good arrangements 
for the allocation of the surplus staff and workers of 
enterprises in keeping with the principles that enterprises 
mainly make the arrangements on their own while the state helps 
in the process and that the basic livelihood of staff and 
workers be guaranteed. 
  22. Establish a modern enterprise wage system. 
The orientation of reform is to achieve enterprises' 
independent distribution in the complete sense, namely that with 
well-defined enterprise property rights and a sound 
self-regulating mechanism and on the premise that the growth 
rate of total wages is lower than the rate of increase of 
enterprises' economic returns and that the average wage increase 
rate of staff and workers is lower than the rate of increase of 
their labor productivity, enterprises enjoy the full independent 
right to distribute wages and the state does not directly 
interfere with their wage distribution, but legislates for, 
guides, and regulates and controls it on the macro scale. 
The supply-demand situation in the labor power market 
plays an essential role in determining wage levels. Wage 
increases are usually determined through collective 
consultation. The incomes of managers, the maintenance 
and increase of the value of assets, and the profits of 
enterprises are linked with one another; and the incomes of 
staff and workers are determined according to their skills and 
to their actual contributions in terms of labor so as to 
implement the principle of "to each according to his work" and 
to bring into full play the stimulating role of wages. At 
present, it is necessary to further improve the method of 
linking total wages with economic returns and combine all kinds 
of allowances, bonuses, and other fringe benefits into wages so 
that staff and workers receive their wages in a physical form 
and in a standardized way. 
  23. Establish a modern enterprise financial and 
accounting system. We should conscientiously implement the 
"Accounting Rules for Enterprises" and establish an enterprise 
financial and accounting system that is in keeping with 
international practice. We should change the practice of 
determining the financial and accounting systems of enterprises 
in keeping with their different forms of ownership, 
organizational patterns, and forms of management. Strengthen 
enterprises' internal financial management and perfect their 
auditing system. We should form an auditing supervisory 
mechanism for enterprises through their internal auditing 
institutions and through social auditing forces. We should 
abandon the concept of "state-run enterprises keeping within 
budgets," which was formed under the conditions of unified state 
control over income and expenditure, and change the status of 
state- owned enterprises as units that set fiscal budgets. 
  24. We should build up the contingent of staff and workers 
and elevate enterprise culture and improve the quality of 
enterprises in an all-round way. We should foster fine 
professional ethics and a spirit of making sacrifices among 
staff and workers and foster a spirit of cooperation in unity, 
loving their professions and their factories, observing the law, 
being faithful to their word, and being ready for new 
explorations and innovations. 
<H5>  V. Steps for Establishing a Modern Enterprise System </H5>
  25. Establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous 
task and necessitates experimentation and the accumulation of 
experience. We will gradually establish it in the approximately 
seven years before the year 2000. 
  In establishing a modern enterprise system, the focus 
is to change the management mechanism of state-owned 
enterprises. At the present time, it is necessary to continue 
to conscientiously implement the Enterprise Law and the 
Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial 
Enterprises Owned by the Whole People, change government 
functions in earnest, give 100 percent of various independent 
rights to enterprises, conscientiously put into practice the 
Regulations on the Supervision and Management of State- Owned 
Assets, and carry out the responsibility of maintaining and 
increasing the value of state-owned assets. We should 
quicken the readjustment of the organizational structure of 
enterprises and gradually form a mechanism of competition. We 
should resolutely prevent the unwarranted pooling of funds and 
the arbitrary requisition of donations from enterprises, reduce 
the burden of enterprises in their support of social 
undertakings, and create fine external conditions for them to 
enter the market and participate in fair competition. 
  26. We should pursue the modern enterprise system in light 
of 
the actual situation of China's enterprises and adopt a variety 
of forms and treat specific cases differently. 
  -- As for enterprises engaging in special industries and 
dealing in special products having to do with national security, 
national defense, and sophisticated technology, we must continue 
to retain their state ownership and put them under direct state 
control and management. If some of them are fitted for the 
corporate system, we should restructure them in keeping with the 
structure of companies owned solely by the state. However, 
where possible we should not have one company monopolizing the 
whole trade or industry. 
  -- Large and medium-sized enterprises having the necessary 
conditions can be restructured in keeping with the structure of 
ordinary companies and absorb nonstate funds. 
  -- We should vigorously and steadily develop a number of 
large enterprise groups which are transregional and embrace 
several trades and that have public ownership as their mainstay 
and are linked by assets, and bring into play their important 
role in promoting structural readjustment, raising returns 
through economies of scale, accelerating the development of new 
technologies and new products, and enhancing competitiveness in 
the international market. 
  -- Small state-owned enterprises should also be standardized 
in keeping with the modern enterprise system. Some can be 
changed into limited liability companies; some can be changed to 
the partnership system in the form of stock sharing; some can be 
contracted out and leased for private management without 
changing their state ownership; and others can be be sold by 
auction, transferring their property rights. In the long run, 
the majority of small state-owned enterprises should gradually 
transfer their property rights to collectives or individuals, 
and the state will achieve a capital funds shift, divert the 
incomes from such sales to industries that urgently need 
developing, and use them in structural readjustment, allocating 
personnel, and supporting the establishment of a social security 
system. 
  -- Urban and rural collective enterprises should be changed 
into partnership enterprises, enterprises employing partnership 
in the form of stock sharing, and limited liability companies on 
the basis of defining the sources of their assets and defining 
their property rights relationships and in keeping with their 
different situations. A few whose scale is large and whose 
returns are good and which conform to the industrial policy can 
be changed into limited liability stock companies or enterprise 
groups. 
  27. The corporation is an effective organizational pattern 
of 
the modern enterprise system. Reorganizing some of the large 
and medium-sized enterprises from the current "factory system" 
into the "corporate system" is a great reform in China's 
enterprise system and is of great significance in changing the 
management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, enhancing their 
competitiveness in the market, and bringing into better play 
their leading role. 
  In reorganizing enterprises into the corporate system, we 
should follow these three principles: 1) Reorganization should 
proceed in accordance with the law. After the Company Law is 
promulgated, relevant departments should formulate regulations 
on company reorganization or methods for standardization and 
make good preparations before reorganization. 2) Conditional 
reorganization. For enterprises reorganizing into the corporate 
system, they must conduct feasibility studies, set up a rational 
stock rights structure, strictly assess and audit their assets, 
formulate the articles of incorporation, and so forth. It is 
necessary to prevent those enterprises that do not need 
reorganization and that do not have the necessary conditions 
from rigidly reorganizing into the corporate system and from 
simply changing their company names. 3) Through 
experimentation, company reorganization should proceed in 
accordance with their different types and in different periods 
and in groups. We should first experiment with enterprises 
whose profits are comparatively good, whose burdens are 
comparatively light, and whose leading groups are of 
comparatively good quality. When we have obtained experience, we 
should gradually promote it. We should prevent reorganizing them 
at the same time. 
  28. As for the reorganization of enterprises into the 
corporate system, most enterprises should choose the form of the 
limited liability company. The limited liability company 
has the characteristics of raising small amounts of funds, being 
easy to operate, being easy to change over, and entailing low 
reorganization costs. We can, in the first place, reorganize 
into limited liability companies those enterprises that conform 
to the state's industrial policy, that occupy an important place 
in their own areas or trades, that produce comparatively good 
economic returns, and that have practiced joint operations. A 
small number of limited liability companies which have made 
profits for three consecutive years and which meet the 
requirements can change into limited liability stock companies. 
As for enterprises directly reorganizing into limited liability 
stock companies or changing from the directional pooling of 
funds to having their shares traded on the market, we should 
strictly examine their qualifications and comply with 
examination and approval procedures in such a way as to be 
responsible to public investors. The number of listed limited 
liability stock companies is only extremely small and we should 
focus on changing them from medium-sized enterprises into large 
enterprises that act as the state's pillar industries. 
  29. Except for special trades or industries, 
state-owned enterprises generally should be reorganized into 
limited liability companies in which many shareholders hold 
shares so as to be conducive to the standardization of their 
operation. Ways of achieving this include: Scattering 
stock rights among different investing units and encouraging 
legal persons to hold each others' shares; changing creditors' 
rights to stock rights with the consent of the creditors and the 
debtors; attracting foreign investors to buy stocks and 
improving the structure of stock ownership; and attracting all 
kinds of funds from society to buy shares, including the funds 
set up for staff and workers within enterprises. 
  30. Clear and dispose of the historical debts of 
state-owned enterprises incurred as a result of policies so that 
they can participate in market competition equally. The 
reasons for the historical debts of enterprises are complicated, 
and some debts have been left over as a result of policy 
adjustment during the changeover from the old economic structure 
to the new, while others have been caused by the improper 
management and operation of enterprises. We should cope with 
them in light of different situations. Debts arising from 
enterprises' expanding business and developing production are 
normal. During enterprises' entry into the market, the 
historical debts incurred as a result of the state's policies 
should be disposed of where the financial capability allows. 
For example, the state's capital funds were increased when the 
"giving of loans instead of appropriations" was changed to 
"investing instead of giving loans" between 1983 and 1985. As 
for the loan losses caused by irresistible objective reasons and 
the policy mistakes of higher authorities, enterprises should 
have their periods of repayment extended without the imposition 
of interest if they are already making efforts and are in a 
position to repay the debts. Some should be allowed to repay 
debts later with interest calculated. Others should have 
interest suspended. Where bad debts exist, they can be written 
off as bank losses after they have been seriously examined by 
the deposit banks and with the approval of relevant departments. 
As for debts incurred as a result of improper management, 
enterprises must repay them themselves. Those which have been 
making losses for a long time and whose assets cannot cover 
their debts and the curbing of whose losses is hopelessly 
impossible should be made bankrupt according to law. 
  31. In pursuing a modern enterprise system, we badly need 
large numbers of operational and management personnel that both 
possess specialized knowledge and modern management experience 
and are innovative and can usher in new prospects. This is an 
important factor in the success or failure of the modern 
enterprise system. As modern entrepreneurs, operational and 
management personnel should become professionals with the 
guarantee of credit and prestige. 
  It is necessary to vigorously train a contingent of 
entrepreneurs and gradually form a management system that 
meets the needs of market economy from personnel selection to 
appraisal to dismissal. 
  32. We should be fully aware of the formidability and 
complexity of establishing a modern enterprise system. For 
company reorganization, the main responsibility of government 
supervisory departments is to study overall preparations and 
measures, formulate relevant policies and regulations, promote 
experimentation, sum up experiences, give guidance, actively 
encourage and steadily proceed with the establishment, practice 
no formalism, and ensure the success rate of reorganization. 
<H3>  IV. Quicken Matching Reforms and Improve Enterprises' 
External Environment (Extracts [as published]) </H3>
  33. When establishing a modern enterprise system, we must 
conduct matching comprehensive reforms in the macroeconomic 
management system, the market system, the social security 
system, and so forth. 
  34. We should reform government organizations, streamline 
the 
administrative structure, and change government functions as 
soon as possible, and change from the direct management of 
economic activities to their indirect regulation and control. 
  35. We should establish a system for the macroscopic 
regulation and control of socialist market economy. 
  -- The state is to set forth the goal and direction for 
economic development, formulate industrial policies, and guide 
the direction of enterprises' investment. 
  -- It should standardize the tax system on the basis of 
practicing the revenue-sharing system. 
  -- It should transform specialized banks into 
enterprise-style commercial banks and introduce the mechanism of 
competition, creating a fine environment for enterprises to pool 
funds. 
  36. We should conscientiously implement the Regulations on 
the Supervision and Management of State-Owned Assets and 
establish a new state-assets management system that both 
guarantees the maintenance and increase of the value of 
state-owned assets and promotes enterprises' operating with high 
efficiency and full vitality. The State Council exercises the 
functions of the owner of state-owned assets on behalf of the 
state. Where possible, we should directly consign to groups of 
companies and large enterprises the rights over state-owned 
assets so as to change them into holding companies. We should 
establish state-owned assets management companies mainly for 
medium-sized and small enterprises and they should manage state- 
owned assets in value form. 
  37. Vigorously foster the market and establish a 
complete market system. First, straighten price 
relationships. Second, standardize the operational and exchange 
regulations and procedures of various types of markets and the 
quality standards of commodities by means of laws and 
regulations and establish corresponding organizations for the 
management, coordination, and supervision of these markets. 
Third, we should foster and perfect the equity exchange market, 
the capital goods market, and the labor force market as soon as 
possible and promote the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system. 
  38. It is necessary to establish, as soon as possible, a 
social security system that covers all staff and workers in 
cities and towns, that integrates basic insurance and 
supplementary insurance, whose capital is rationally shared by 
the state, the enterprise, and the individual, and whose 
management is socialized, creating conditions for enterprise 
reform and for the free flow of labor. 
  39. We should establish and perfect all kinds of 
intermediary 
organizations and establish links between enterprises and the 
market and between enterprises and the state. First, we should 
set up nongovernmental accountants' offices, lawyers' offices, 
auditors' offices, assets assessment organizations, personnel 
exchange centers, and so forth. Second, we should establish and 
perfect all kinds of associations or societies and social groups 
representing different interests, coordinate the development of 
their trades through set channels and forms, and communicate the 
needs of different interest strata to the government. Third, we 
should establish and perfect relevant organizations that serve 
enterprises and the government such as employment agencies and 
arbitration organizations. 
  40. It is necessary to formulate and perfect laws regarding 
relevant aspects: First, laws regarding the main body of the 
market such as company laws, banking laws, and labor laws. 
Second, laws regarding market order such as an improper 
competition act, a negotiable instruments act, and a securities 
act. Third, laws regarding macroscopic regulation and control 
such as a budget act, tax laws, and a state-owned assets 
supervision act. Fourth, laws regarding social security such as 
a social security act and a minimum wage act. Fifth, economic 
penalty laws.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- XINHUA reporter 
recently interviewed a responsible person of the State General 
Administration of Taxation and asked him some questions about 
the value-added tax. The responsible person said: With the 
State Council's approval, we have begun collection of the 
value-added tax at production, wholesale, and retail stages. 
The tax, with a uniform basic rate of 17 percent, is levied 
only on the increased portion of the value at each stage. Some 
people are worried that the collection of the value-added tax 
will cause commodity price increases. Some enterprises construe 
it as adding the 17-percent tax to the original selling price of 
any commodity. Others think that the tax is collected on the 
total value of a commodity both during its production and during 
its marketing. None of these interpretations is correct. 
  The responsible person said: The collection of the 
value-added tax will not cause price increases. It is because 
the new tax is a conversion from the old product tax, 
value-added tax and business tax; and it is only a change in the 
mode of tax collection. During the conversion, we have not 
increased the total tax burden. So, it should not cause any 
changes in retail prices. Then, why do we generally collect the 
value-added tax at the commodity production and wholesale 
stages? The value-added tax is a common practice in foreign 
countries, and it is much better than our old tax system of 
collecting product taxes, value-added taxes, and business taxes 
separately. First, the new tax rate is simpler, with a basic 
tax rate of 17 percent and a preferential tax rate of 13 
percent. In the old system, the value-added tax had 12 
different rates, the business tax had four different rates, and 
the product tax had several dozen different rates, making the 
collection a very complex process. Next, the new procedures for 
paying the value-added tax require a special invoice which 
indicates all the value-taxes paid for the product earlier so 
that they will be deducted from current payment and thus avoid 
the old problem of double taxation. The separation of tax from 
calculated price makes the tax amount clear at a glance. 
Besides, the value-added tax is conducive to specialized 
production. 
  The responsible person said: Some enterprises construe the 
tax not included in the calculated prices as adding a 17-percent 
tax to original selling price. This is a misinterpretation. 
For a long time, China had practiced a tax-inclusive pricing 
system in marketing commodities. So, the tax was included in 
the selling prices of most commodities in the past. For 
instance, if a commodity had a price tag of 100 yuan, its actual 
price was 85.5 yuan and there was a tax of 14.5 yuan; but the 
tax of 14.5 yuan was not separately indicated. The new 
value-added tax system, unlike the old practice, requires 
separate indication of commodity price and tax. In this way, 
the price of a commodity at present actually consists two parts 
before it reaches the retailer. Moreover, in selling a product, 
the enterprise must make out a special value- added tax invoice 
showing both the price of product and the tax amount. Take the 
above-mentioned 100-yuan commodity, for instance. Its actual 
price is 85.5 yuan, and the tax is 14.5 yuan. The tax amount is 
17 percent of 85.5 yuan. So, it is evidently wrong to construe 
the tax not included in the calculated prices as adding a 
17-percent tax to the original selling price. 
  Then, why is it wrong to say that the value-added tax is 
collected on the total value at both the production and 
marketing stages? Because according to the regulations, the 
value-added tax is levied on only the increased portion of the 
value of a product, and the previously-paid value-added tax for 
the product may be deducted. This is greatly different from the 
old practice of collecting product tax according to selling 
price. For instance, a garment factory pays 100 yuan plus a tax 
of 17 yuan for material before making a garment. After the 
garment is completed, the factory sells it for 150 yuan. The 
value-added tax at this stage should be: 150 x 17 percent - 17 = 
8.5 yuan. The formula may also be: (150-100) x 17 percent = 8.5 
yuan. It is very clear that the value-added tax does not mean 
collection of 17 percent of tax on the total value at both the 
production and the marketing stages. The tax is levied only on 
the increased portion of the value. The two interpretations are 
greatly different from each other. Of course, I must make it 
clear that we adhered to the principle of no change in total tax 
burden in designing the value-added tax reform. The uniform tax 
rate may reduce the tax burden of most enterprises, but will 
perhaps increase the tax burden on a small number of enterprises 
because their products carried less tax in the past. The 
increased tax burden of enterprises can be compensated for by 
the lower income tax rate and the abolition of the "two funds." 
Besides, enterprises should offset the increased burden by 
improving management and product quality and by lowering costs. 
They should not solve the problem by raising prices. 
  The responsible person said: It merits our attention that 
some enterprises at present deliberately drive up prices while 
the new tax system has just begun and some people still lack 
sufficient knowledge of it. Such unreasonable price increases 
must be resolutely stopped.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Shi Mingshen (2457 2494 1957): "What </F>
Does the Reunification of the Renminbi Foreign Exchange Rates 
Mean?"] 
  [Text] On 1 January the People's Bank of China published 
the renminbi's new exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, which 
was 8.7 yuan to $1. Beginning from this day, the renminbi's 
foreign exchange rates were reunified. The enterprises and 
residents would have to purchase foreign exchange from the banks 
at the unified rates. Thus, the situation of having both 
official list rates and the swapping rates ended. 
  The ultimate objective of reunifying the renminbi foreign 
exchange rates is to realize free exchange of the currency. 
According to the experiences of other countries, there should at 
least be three conditions for the free exchange of a country's 
currency. First, an ample reserve of foreign exchange; second, 
devaluation or depreciation of the country's currency to a 
reasonable level and establishment of a foreign exchange market 
with banks as the main body; and third, an increase in the 
nation's economic strength. Reunification of the renminbi 
foreign exchange rates and promoting reform of the foreign 
exchange system are both aimed at creating better conditions for 
advancing toward this objective. 
  Beginning this year, the system of retaining and handing in 
foreign exchange will be abolished and be replaced by a system 
of banks selling and converting foreign exchange. This means 
that conditions have been relaxed for the enterprises in using 
foreign exchange. In the past, a part of the foreign exchange 
earned by the enterprises should be turned over to the state, 
and for each portion of foreign exchange they wanted to retain, 
they had to ask for the approval of the higher authorities level 
by level. In order to import raw materials, the enterprises had 
to shuttle between various responsible departments, foreign 
exchange administrative departments, and banks. After 
reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, it is easy 
for the enterprises to convert their foreign exchange income 
into renminbi at the day's rates and decide how to use the 
foreign exchange. When they want to use foreign exchange, they 
can make the exchange with the renminbi by providing effective 
certificates to the banks, so long as the use of foreign 
exchange does not violate the state's industrial policy. This 
is conducive to mobilizing the initiative of enterprises in 
exporting their products to earn foreign exchange and increasing 
the competitiveness of Chinese products in international markets. 
  The important measure of the Chinese Government on 
reunification of the renminbi's foreign exchange rates is also 
well-received by foreign businessmen. Under the dual exchange 
rates system, when the registered capital of a foreign firm in 
China was $1 million, it was equal to more than 5.7 million yuan 
according to the official list price. But when they earned a 
profit of more than 5.7 million yuan and wanted to remit it 
outside the border, it could only be converted into $650,000 
according to the swap market price. Because of the two 
different exchange rates for the incoming and outgoing 
currencies, the profit of foreign firms was reduced. After 
reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, the 
convertible amount of renminbi for the same amount of foreign 
exchange will increase and the foreign investors will have more 
profits. Naturally, their enthusiasm in reinvestment will be 
further kindled. After reunification of the renminbi exchange 
rates, export and foreign funds will increase and there will be 
a steady flow of foreign exchange to our country. This will lay 
a reliable foundation for the smooth progress of reform of the 
foreign exchange structure. 
  What should be pointed out is that the abolishment of the 
dual exchange rates system indicates a stronger purchase power 
of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. As a result, 
the prices of some trades concerning foreign affairs or foreign 
nationals, such as hotels and civil aviation companies, which 
originally used the renminbi's foreign exchange coupons to 
settle their accounts, should be appropriately readjusted. For 
example, according to the new system, an air ticket for a flight 
from Beijing to Shanghai now costs 900 yuan (or $103 when 
converted into the dollar), which was 590 yuan of the foreign 
exchange coupon in the past. 
  The common people, individually, are showing greater 
concerns 
for the possibility of a big rise in commodity prices after the 
renminbi's exchange rates are reunified. Apparently, because of 
the lower value of the renminbi after reunification of its 
exchange rates, commodity prices will go up. But after a 
careful analysis, we will find out that the reunification of the 
renminbi's exchange rates will only slightly affect the 
commodity prices. First, the original rate of $1 to 5.8 yuan 
could hardly be found in real practice. In the market, most 
import goods were purchased in accordance with the swapping 
rate. Some even cost higher than the current reunified rate 
(that is, $1 to 9 or 10 yuan). Second, beginning from 31 
December, customs duties for some import commodities have been 
reduced. For example, those for refrigerators, microwave 
stoves, video game machines, recording tapes, and color 
television sets have been reduced from 100 to 50 percent. Thus, 
the costs for importing these products by enterprises have been 
relevantly reduced. Moreover, the readjustment of prices of 
hotels and air tickets for foreign nationals will mainly affect 
people outside rather than the great majority of domestic 
residents. 
  This year the state has put forth various measures for 
promoting reform of the foreign exchange structure. In the 
course of the new structure replacing the old, there still may 
be unexpected problems and difficulties. But we can be sure 
that by reunifying the exchange rate, disorder, speculation, and 
unfairness under the dual exchange rates system will be 
eliminated and conditions for fair competition will be created 
for the enterprises. This is conducive to promoting the 
marketization, standardization, and internationalization of the 
Chinese economy.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Technology Exports Rise 13 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] China's exports of machinery and electronics jumped 
by 13 percent to $22.5 billion last year, according to 
statistics from the General Administration of Customs. 
  Machinery and electronics are now China's second largest 
source of hard currency, after textiles. 
  Machinery and electronics products accounted for 24.5 
percent 
of all exports last year, compared with 6.1 percent in 1986. 
  Although the 13 percent growth rate is impressive, Chinese 
officials are still not satisfied: From 1986 to 1992, machinery 
and electronics exports grew by an average of 42 percent each 
year. 
  A senior official with the State Economic and Trade 
Commission attributed last year's slower growth to the brisk 
domestic market, which dampened producers' enthusiasm for 
exports. 
  The rising costs of raw materials and energy also reduced 
exporters' competitive edge against other countries. 
  Promoting exports of machinery and electronics is a priority 
of the government. 
  The government hopes to increase such exports to $30 billion 
by 1995, the official said. The figure is expected to reach $60 
billion by the turn of the century, making machinery and 
electronics the country's No. 1 source of hard currency. 
  In 15 years, planners hope exports will amount to $150 
billion. 
  To reach this ambitious goal, the official said, the 
machinery and electronics industries should develop some 
mainstay export products, such as factory machinery, ships and 
automobiles. 
  Besides traditional export markets, Chinese manufacturers 
should also explore new markets in Latin America, the Middle 
East and Africa. 
  The official with the State Economic and Trade Commission 
said the government will use financial incentives to help 
stimulate future exports of machinery and electronics. 
  Banks and financial institutions will provide more long-term 
loans under preferential terms to support the export of factory 
machinery, aircraft and ships. 
  Establishment of a national import and export bank may also 
improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports. 
  The country's Chamber of Imports and Exports of Machinery 
and 
Electronics Products intends to play a bigger role in 
maintaining export orders. 
  Domestic exporters, meanwhile, are encouraged to use foreign 
manufacturers' technology, designs, brands and marketing 
networks.

<F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Official Calls For More Light Industry </F>
Exports"] 
  [Text] China's light industry should boost exports and 
attract more foreign capital, technology and talented people 
during 1994. 
  Exports should increase by 15 per cent, according to 
projections unveiled yesterday by Yu Zhen, Chairwoman of the 
China National Light Industry Council, at a national working 
conference in Shenzhen. 
  Yu told the conference that China's expected re-entry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will present 
both opportunities and challenges for the country's light 
industry. 
  The chairwoman called for exports of light industrial 
products to reach $34.5 billion in 1994, a 15 per cent hike over 
last year. The industry's exports in 1993 are estimated at $30 
billion, a 15 per cent increase over the previous year. 
  Yu also urged her colleagues to strive for 15 per cent 
growth 
in light industrial output value this year. Her goal is to top 
506 billion yuan ($58.16 billion), compared with 43 billion yuan 
($50 billion) in 1993. 
  "Quality is the key to establish the reputation of China's 
light industry in both domestic and world markets," Yu said. 
  She vowed that more than 90 per cent of durable goods would 
meet international standards. 
  Yu also predicted that light industry would develop more 
than 
800 kinds of new products. 
  Light industry is one of China's pillar industries. Its 
output currently generates a third of the country's total 
industrial output, and its export value accounts for another 
third of the nation's total. 
  The products from light industry cover 44 sectors, including 
processed foods, beverages, detergents, electronic appliances, 
bicycles, watches, paper and decorative materials. 
  China has become the world's leading producer of more than 
10 
products including bicycles, china, watches, washing machines, 
beer and refrigerators, Yu noted. 
  She said light industry will continue to transfer the 
management system of enterprises to a more flexible one. 
  She said 31 light industry enterprises are now listed on the 
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and more enterprises will 
soon be listed. 
  Yu forecast that light industry would reduce debt-plagued 
enterprises by five per cent this year. 
  She said low profits are a main problem of China's light 
industry. Last year, the number of money losing enterprises 
increased by more than 20 per cent over the previous year. 
Their losses jumped by the same percentage. 
  Yu said during 1994 light industry will focus on the 
co-operation in key sectors with more of the world's major 
companies. 
  Yu said 1994 looks to he a promising year for China's 
economy. Its growth will help light industry's rapid development. 
  Economists predict the gross national product (GNP) will 
increase by 9 per cent in 1994 with a 15 per cent rise in the 
light industry products sector. 
  During the year, the retail value of consumption products 
will jump 19 per cent and the export value is expected to climb 
a solid 10 per cent. 
  Products generated by light industry will see a steadily 
growing market this year, Yu predicted.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan: "Chemical Sector Wants 8 Percent Boost in </F>
Production"] 
  [Text] The chemical industry's biggest task in 1994 is to 
boost production and increase exports, according to the Ministry 
of the Chemical Industry. 
  A ministry official yesterday said the chemical industry 
will 
pursue 8 per cent growth this year. That will bring its annual 
production value to 190 billion yuan ($21.84 billion). 
  Last year, total production in the chemical sector was worth 
178.79 billion yuan ($20.55 billion), an increase of 7.2 per 
cent over the previous year. 
  Chemical product exports should experience a 16 per cent 
rise 
over 1993, the official said. 
  However, the export growth rate set for this year is lower 
than that in 1993. 
  In the January-November period last year, China's chemical 
sector saw its imports hit $11.02 billion, up 1.6 per cent while 
its exports reached $9.97 billion, representing a record growth 
of 27.3 per cent. 
  Among exports, the ratio of finished products to unfinished 
products increased last year, indicating China's chemical 
industry has made progress in variety and quality of goods, as 
well as advances of its technologies. 
  In the past, raw chemical materials amounted to a large 
share 
of exports due to China's low technical level, the official said. 
  Meanwhile the chemical industry this year will continue its 
opening drive in a bid to attract more foreign investment and 
establish more foreign-funded ventures in coastal areas, the 
official said. 
  But the spokesman warned that last year's problems of funds 
shortages and price hikes for raw materials energy resources and 
transportation may continue to restrain this years production. 
  Due to price hikes, the chemical industry suffered a 
production cost rise of more than 7.3 billion yuan ($844.8 
million) last year. That figure was 1.7 fold the industry's 
total profits in 1992.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Electronics Fledglings May Grow Into </F>
Titans"] 
  [Text] Could China turn out a Sony or a Matsushita? 
  Although many people are sceptical, the Ministry of 
Electronics Industry is determined to foster some electronics 
giants in this country. 
  This will be an arduous task, but an urgent one as well. 
  Currently, most of the country's 18,000 electronics 
factories 
will suffer from their weak competitiveness and many of them 
will be closed," said Lin Yuanfang, deputy director of the 
ministry's Department of Economic Operation and Structural 
Reform. 
  The value of China's electronics production last year 
exceeded 130 billion yuan ($14.94 billion). However, the figure 
is only 26 percent of Matsushita's annual revenue. 
  China has set up more than 200 electric groups, but they are 
still fledglings. None can be called a giant. 
  Shanghai Audio and Video Ltd Co, organized by the city's 
four 
television makers, is now the country's largest electronics firm. 
  But is annual revenue last year, about 3.5 billion yuan 
($402 
million), is just 0.7 percent of Matsushita's sales. 
  One important reason that no large enterprises have emerged 
in this country is that investment in the industry has been so 
scanty, said Shao Huiwen, deputy director of the ministry's 
Department of Overall Planning. 
  During the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-90), the 
government injected only 7.1 billion yuan ($816 million) into 
the industry for technical renovation and capital construction, 
less than 1 percent of the government's total investment in the 
economy. 
  The government promised 13 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) for 
the industry during the 1991-95 period, but that still lags far 
behind demand, Shao said. 
  The amount is less than what many big-name foreign companies 
spend each year on developing new products. 
  To make matters worse, such meagre investment must be 
divided 
among many projects around the country. Thus, Shao said, no 
project will get enough capital for renovation and expansion. 
  To improve China's competitiveness in the world, the 
ministry 
has proposed setting up some large electronics groups in the 
country. 
  "We hope that these biggies would help rationalize the 
distribution of resources and steer the development of the whole 
industry," said Lin Yuanfang. 
  As the first step, the ministry plans next year to set up 
several electronics groups each with annual revenue exceeding 5 
billion yuan ($575 million). 
  By the year 2000, there will be three to five big names in 
China with annual revenue surpassing 30 billion yuan ($3.4 
billion) each. 
  The ministry will also select some promising enterprises 
and, 
through preferential treatment, help them expand into large 
groups. 
  A detailed programme on how to generate China's Sony or 
Matsushita will be disclosed very soon.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- China is opening 
more onshore oil projects for international bidding in a bold 
drive for expanded cooperation with foreign partners. 
  Wang Tao, president of China National Petroleum Corp. 
(CNPC), 
unveiled the second round of international bidding here today. 
  The first round for exploring oil and gas in the Tarim Basin 
in China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ended last 
year. An initial petroleum contract has been signed between the 
CNPC and the Exxon and the Japan Oil Company group. More 
commercial negotiations are under way. 
  Wang said the projects now open to foreign bidding fall into 
two categories -- risk exploration and enhanced oil recovery 
projects. Registration will begin on February 15, 1994. 
  In the first category, 26 exploration blocks in China's nine 
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of 
Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, 
Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin are inviting foreign bids. 
  According to Wang, oil resources in these blocks with a 
total 
area of 216,000 square kilometers are estimated at 6.2 billion 
tons and natural gas resources at 800 billion cubic meters. 
  "This indicates a good prospect for exploration," Wang said. 
  He added that most blocks are located near industrial and 
agricultural centers with convenient transportation 
infrastructures, which will surely facilitate operations there. 
  Wang assured that international conventions and formulas for 
product-sharing will be adopted in this round of bidding as in 
the previous one. Foreign companies will be solely responsible 
for all exploration risks in the contract blocks. 
  Commercial discoveries will be jointly developed by Chinese 
and foreign partners while post-tax profits will be shared in 
accordance with the terms and conditions set in the contracts. 
  Wang said the second category covers enhanced oil recovery 
projects in 11 developed blocks scattered in the eight mature 
oil fields of Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu, 
Zhongyuan and Jilin. 
  Total oil-bearing area in the blocks is 190.2 square 
kilometers with oil reserves of 380 million tons in place. The 
recovery factor in these blocks varies from 18.3 to 85.3 percent 
of the recoverable reserves, Wang told the conference. 
  Located within developed fields, with reliable resources, 
complete infrastructures and guaranteed logistic support, these 
projects are expected to be quick to produce results. 
  In the projects, foreign companies will shoulder risks 
alone, 
or together with the Chinese side, for pilot tests. The two 
sides will be joint operators after stimulation methods are 
chosen and share the incremental increases in oil following tax 
payment. 
  Wang said foreign companies are free to forward their 
tenders 
individually or to bid through the formation of consortiums. 
  The registered foreign companies will start data review, 
purchase data packages and make field trips from March 1 to 
August 1, 1994. The bidding is scheduled to end on August 30, 
1994, followed by bid evaluation. 
  Wang said China is looking for overseas cooperation in 
downstream utilization of oil and gas, construction of 
long-distance oil and gas pipelines and manufacturing of special 
petroleum equipment as well as engineering and technical 
services. 
  It will also seek foreign partners to explore and develop 
oil 
and gas resources outside China, Wang added.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 16 (XINHUA) -- More and more 
foreign consumer goods, helped by lively advertising, are coming 
into China's shops, with a surge expected in the run-up to the 
spring festival, a traditional Chinese holiday. 
  Most urban residents have been aware of the flood of foreign 
brands, from color televisions to motorcycles, from garments to 
cosmetics, and from drinks to small buttons. 
  Economists here believe that with the drive of opening wider 
to the outside world and a hefty rise of foreign investments in 
the country, it is an inevitable outcome that more foreign 
manufacturers try to get into markets in China, and consumer 
goods must lead the way. 
  But, they said, most of the foreign brands which entered 
Chinese markets were through the numerous joint ventures in the 
country, while the Chinese Government has lifted the margin for 
imports over the past years. 
  Various kinds of foreign-made goods are now being sold in 
the 
large department stores and modernized shopping centers, and a 
few special shops have been set up to sell the foreign products. 
  Take for instance the Quanyechang Market, a large retail 
sales center in Tianjin built 60 years ago. Among 350,000 kinds 
of goods on sale in the center in 1993, 8.4 percent were 
overseas-made, with a total turnover of 25 million yuan. 
  Even in a small shop with only a dozen employees, reporters 
were told that about 50 percent of the goods sold were from 
foreign-funded companies. 
  It is a common practice that most of the products of these 
joint ventures, sold with foreign trade marks on the domestic 
market, contain some parts imported from their parent firms 
abroad. 
  The Tianjin No. 1 Light Industry Bureau has organized 96 
such 
joint ventures with the aid of U.S. and German companies, whose 
annual turnover reached 1.2 billion yuan in 1993. 
  An official of the industry bureau said that as long as 
these 
ventures can keep balance in their foreign exchange, there is no 
problem for their products to enter China's market. 
  The lowered import duties and restructured foreign exchange 
system will encourage more foreign dealers to compete in the 
domestic market, he said. 
  Also, he added, with a sturdy rise in their living 
standards, 
consumers in urban districts have begun to turn to high-quality 
products. 
  To meet the increasing demand for foreign brands, a 
newly-built Quanyechang Market building here will be put into 
operation in September, mainly to sell imported goods or 
products made by joint ventures. 
  When completed, its annual turnover is expected to reach one 
billion yuan.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS) -- The President of the 
People's Construction Bank of China, Mr. Zhou Daojiong, said 
that the bank would finish its shift into a commercial bank this 
year when policy-oriented loans for state key items and the 
discount business would switch to the newly founded state 
development bank. 
  With alterations in the management mechanism, the 
construction bank will see a lot of changes in its business and 
this will be effected in two main parts. First, its direct 
undertaking of policy-oriented business and discount business 
will be handled in a way of being entrusted by the state 
development bank. Second, the new management mechanism employed 
by the construction bank will observe the pattern of a 
commercial bank featuring responsibility for its own management, 
risks, for its own profit and loss as well as self discipline. 
  The bank will undertake medium- and long-term credit 
business 
with no change in its name or status as an independent legal 
person while the ranking of the staffing remains unchanged. 
  As of late last year the bank registered total general 
deposits of RMB 372.2 billion [renminbi] while the balance of 
various loans was put at RMB 32.9 billion. 
  Following the establishment of a representative office in 
London, the bank last year also set up such offices in Tokyo, 
Seoul, Hong Kong and Singapore while preparations for a branch 
in New York is now underway.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "More Aid for Rural Industry"] </F>
  [Text] The China Agribusiness Development Trust &amp; 
Investment Corp (Cadtic) is expected to introduce $100 million 
in foreign capital for rural firms this year. 
  Zhai Xinhua, general manager of the corporation, said Cadtic 
will strive to gain its goal by drumming up more loans from the 
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other international 
financial institutions. 
  This year got off to a good start when the Asian Development 
Bank agreed to lend the corporation $50 million to support 
township enterprises, he said. 
  Zhai noted that his firm had been under the jurisdiction of 
the State Planning Commission until this month, when the central 
government placed it directly under the authority of the 
Ministry of Agriculture. Government officials had pointed out 
that the decision was a formal attempt to financially back the 
ministry's rural work. 
  Backed by the State Planning Commission, the non-banking 
financial corporation has involved itself in the development of 
township industries, foreign trade and securities as well as 
real estate. Its profits last year surpassed 100 million yuan 
($11.5 million). 
  Zhai said that this year his firm is expected to raise at 
least 300 million yuan ($34.5 million) to help set up a 
development fund for township enterprises. 
  Because township enterprises are considered a major force in 
promoting the rural economy and in absorbing the huge surplus of 
rural workers, he said, they need steady financial support from 
the ministry, which administers rural areas. 
  Apart from introducing foreign loans to help rural 
industries 
update their manufacturing technology, Cadtic also plans to 
issue shares on the country's securities swap markets this year 
to raise money for the development fund. 
  Zhai noted that since Cadtic has gained experience in 
various 
financial fields, it can now help other companies under the 
ministry settle their accounts. 
  He suggested that all of the ministry's companies co-operate 
with each other by setting up an industrial group this year to 
contribute collectively to the rural economy. 
  Since it is already listed on the securities exchanges in 
Shanghai and Shenzhen, trading in Cadtic shares is expected to 
hit 13.5 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) this year, up 500 million 
yuan ($57.5 million) from last year. 
  Cadtic expects its profits this year to surpass those of 
last 
year -- which it would not disclose -- by more than 100 million 
yuan ($11.5 million). 
  While fostering development of its traditional businesses, 
Cadtic also plans to widen its scope. 
  Zhai said the corporation projects 1994 export earnings of 
$40 million, $28 million more than last year. 
  By diversifying, the corporation's gross assets are expected 
to expand by 1995 to 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion), up 20.5 
billion yuan ($2.35 billion) from 1993.

"Grain Shock and Related Issues"] 
  [Text] Dear brother: 
  Since this autumn, grain prices in some areas of the 
mainland 
have fluctuated. First, rice prices in coastal areas went up 
and, in the meantime, rice prices in China's major producing 
regions, such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, also rose in 
succession. In December, shock waves of grain price hikes in 
southern China spread to the north and influenced prices of 
other varieties of grain, such as wheat, corn, and edible oil. 
  During the 15 years of reform and opening up, panic buying 
in 
a small number of localities, triggered by the fluctuation of 
some commodity prices, was not an unusual occurrence. But 
because this time the problem was with grain, a special 
commodity, the shock it caused to the people was naturally much 
bigger. Moreover, this disturbance affected an extensive area. 
It quickly sparked the concern of the entire society and grain 
prices became a hot topic. Those who had shown a relatively 
high degree of tolerance toward increases of some commodity 
prices due to price reform, also found it hard to keep cool this 
time. The State Council was very concerned about grain prices. 
In late December, the State Council held a special work meeting 
and decided on a number of measures to keep grain prices under 
control. It made some stipulations, such as setting a ceiling 
on retail prices. The promulgation of these relevant measures 
quickly reversed the situation. The grain shock, which had 
lasted several months while constantly spreading far and wide, 
was gradually appeased. This also indicates that the country 
has sufficient grain reserve and is able to roll back grain 
prices to a rational level. 
  Nevertheless, how did this shock begin? Information supplied 
by the Ministry of Agriculture indicates that 1993 was a 
fruitful year for agriculture. With the exception of reduced 
cotton output, total grain output reached a record high and new 
grain purchased by the state and put into storage was roughly 
the same as last year. 
  What is the reason for these big increases in grain prices 
in 
a year of bumper grain harvests? 
  The authorities here believe that the fluctuations in grain 
prices at present are not a problem of grain production. An 
in-depth and cool-headed analysis is necessary on this issue. 
It is right to say that the supply of agricultural products in 
various localities on the mainland is sufficient, but prices of 
agricultural products are relatively low. Cheap grain harms the 
peasants. In these years, peasants in major producing regions 
find grain cultivation less and less lucrative, or even lose 
money growing grain. Since reform began 15 years ago, grain 
prices have been adjusted a number of times, but because prices 
of agricultural industrial products have been rising too fast in 
the meantime, the scissors difference between industrial and 
agricultural prices did not narrow, but has widened. In recent 
years, the growth rate of peasants' income has been visibly 
lower than that of the urban population. In this context, the 
peasants' wish to increase grain prices to some extent is 
completely understandable. 
  But while peasants waited for price increases and hesitated 
to sell their grain too early lest they lost money, consumers, 
for fear of big price hikes next year, wanted to buy more grain 
and put it aside. Grain dealers, who deal between the producers 
and consumers, and state-run grain enterprises, in their 
capacity as the main channels of state-managed grain 
circulation, were naturally very aware of such a mentality among 
producers and consumers. Both wanted sales prices of grain to 
go up so that state-run grain enterprises could make up for 
losses they had suffered over the years as a result of the state 
subsidy policy to some extent, and individual grain dealers 
would have a chance to make more profits. Furthermore, some 
circulation channels at the moment are not very smooth. As a 
result, grain prices spiralled upwards. 
  The above-mentioned circumstances were the inherent causes 
of 
the grain price hikes. Here, one can easily recognize that 
although some elements were not entirely irrational, these price 
fluctuations are very abnormal and the main cause is 
psychological. Certain erroneous beliefs are worthy of 
attention. At present, problems are largely found in the 
circulation field. If grain prices are too low, this is not 
conducive to grain production, so they should be raised to an 
appropriate degree and step by step. But fluctuations that are 
too fast and too drastic will pose a disadvantage to both 
producers and consumers and may cause shocks to other commodity 
prices. They are also very negative for the implementation of 
many of the reform measures that are about to emerge. The idea 
held by some people that "price hikes are harmless" is wrong. 
Grain is a commodity, but a special commodity. If grain is not 
brought into the market system, there is no future for grain 
production. In the process of moving toward a market system, we 
should explore special methods for managing this special 
commodity and establish special means of regulation and control. 
The mainland has a population of 1.2 billion and food is still 
first things first. Even the slightest problem in this respect 
may jeopardize social stability and undermine the overall 
interests of reform. Therefore, some men of insight here 
believe that the fluctuation in grain prices this time is not 
necessarily an entirely negative event: It is a reminder to 
relevant quarters that in the course of establishing a socialist 
market economy, grain, as a special commodity, should be managed 
with special methods. It goes without saying that we must never 
backtrack. The only way out is to deepen the reform. 
  The grain shock not only provides a topic for people working 
in the grain production and circulation fields to ponder, but 
also sets a serious question for people in all circles on the 
mainland: Are we prepared for this big switch toward a market 
economy? Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and State Council 
have time and again advised cadres at all levels and the general 
public to be fully prepared for a market economy. A market 
economy is a stormy ocean and we lack the necessary knowledge 
and competence to sail on this ocean. When this great vessel of 
ours embarks on its voyage toward the ocean of the market 
economy, all the crew, sailors, and passengers must be prepared 
and learn to sum up experience in practice. Only in this way 
can we reach our destination in triumph. Practicing a market 
economy does not cancel the need to strengthen management, still 
less does it warrant a laissez-faire attitude. We must conduct 
well the necessary macroregulation and control in accordance 
with the laws of the market. This is a topic which is derived 
from the grain shock that is being discussed by people here. I 
have talked about it briefly in the hope that it will throw some 
light on your understanding of the situation on the mainland.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Farm Levies Cut By $1.2b"] </F>
  [Text] Chinese farmers are able to heave a sigh of relief 
this year as the government has removed a collective financial 
burden of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) from their shoulders 
since last year. 
  An official from the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday 
that each of the 900 million farmers in the country now pays 11 
yuan ($1.3) less than before for various financial charges and 
public duties imposed by government departments at various 
levels. 
  Li Xiangang, official with the department of rural 
co-operative economy under the Ministry of Agriculture said, 
"That is a direct result of a series of measures taken by the 
central government last year to reduce burdens on farmers." 
  In an interview yesterday, Li said the information came from 
a just-completed nationwide inspection made by his team on the 
implementation of the central government's policy. 
  Prompted by increasing complaints and discontent in the 
country's rural areas about the growing levies, which required 
cash payment or labour contributions from farmers, the central 
government has since last year cancelled 43 non-agricultural 
public duties and abolished 37 charges borne by rural residents. 
  Those decades-old duties, previously imposed by different 
ministries and departments under the central government, 
included a variety of communal projects, such as training of 
militia, rural public security, housing land charges, rural film 
and TV relay services, rodent control, subsidies for rural 
doctors, and the construction and development of social welfare 
projects and facilities. 
  All these projects demanded farmers to offer either labour 
or 
money, resulting in excessive burdens on farmers and disruption 
of normal agricultural production, the official said. 
  The State Council had earlier stipulated that a farmer 
should 
not have to pay more than 5 per cent of his annual income as 
taxes or duties to the central and local governments. 
  But a survey early last year showed that farmers in 
one-third 
of the country's provinces municipalities and regions had been 
forced to cough up 10 per cent or more of their annual income 
for special assessments. 
  The complaints from farmers about these improper practices 
flooded into the central government as they were too heavy for 
farmers to bear. 
  The State Council set up a special inspection team last 
September with members from five ministries to conduct a survey 
of more than 2,000 rural households in 18 provinces. 
  Now more than a half of China's provinces, municipalities 
and 
regions have issued decrees or regulations, or set up 
supervision, auditing and budget systems, to control the 
imposing of these burdens on farmers, he added. 
  But he pointed out the central government's policies have 
not 
been well carried out in some areas and some cases of excessive 
levies still exist.

<F P=106> [By Correspondent Wang Kelin (3769 0344 2651): "Strengthen </F>
the United Front Work During the New Period and Serve the 
Capital's Stability and Development"] 
  [Text] The two-day Beijing Municipal united front work 
conference ended yesterday. Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, gave an important speech at the 
conference. He emphatically pointed out: Party committees at 
all levels should pay great attention to united front work, 
further enhance the concept on united front and never slightly 
slacken our leadership over united front work. It is necessary 
to unite with nonparty personages in various sectors to jointly 
build our country and unite with as many people as we can. If we 
fail to have this consciousness, that means we are practicing 
closed-doorism and will be unable to vigorously develop our 
undertakings. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: At present, a considerable number 
of leading cadres have failed to fully understand the importance 
of united front work and believed that united front work was 
"important in the past, but not now," and that it is "all right 
to have it or do without it and to slacken or tighten efforts in 
it." These are all wrong. United front work is our "magic 
weapon" in the past and it is still so today. During the 
democratic revolution period, our party was fairly weak and 
small. We would be unable to win victory in the revolution if 
we did not have the people's support and have so many people to 
rally with us. At that time, united front work was a matter of 
life and death and the people had a fuller understanding of it. 
However, along with the victory in revolution, our strength 
became stronger; we were in control of the political power; and 
some comrades began to pay less attention to united front work. 
This is very one-sided. Actually, during the period of 
accelerating reform, opening up and economic development, we 
need united front work and the new situation has also put 
forward higher demands on united front work. The united front 
is playing an important role in guaranteeing social stability 
and economic construction, and its tasks are not lightened but 
aggravated. 
  Chen Xitong called on party committees at all levels to 
further enhance their understanding of the united front's 
strategic status, strengthen the party's leadership over united 
front work and include it on the agenda. We should pay 
attention to making friends with people outside the party, do a 
better job in implementing the system of multi-party cooperation 
and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, 
formulate specific measures and open more channels for 
democratic parties and people from various circles to 
participate in the discussion of political affairs and give 
democratic supervision; pay attention to absorbing people 
outside the party to participate in the work of government 
departments; support and help democratic parties to train 
successors and solve some practical problems of democratic 
parties and representative personages outside the party. 
Meanwhile, we should realistically strengthen the building of 
ranks of united front work cadres and of united front work 
organs. 
  In his speech, Chen Xitong further stressed: To successfully 
carry out united front work, we must deeply conduct 
investigations and studies because only on this basis can we be 
able to develop and blaze new trial in a better manner. To 
judge the success or failure in united front work, we should see 
whether we can unite with all the strength that can be united, 
whether we can mobilize all positive factors and whether we have 
made contributions to safeguarding stability and unity in the 
country and the capital and realizing the goal of enabling 
Beijing Municipality to become well-off three years ahead of 
schedule. 
  At the conference, Shen Rendao, vice chairman of the 
municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political 
consultative Conference [CPPCC] and director of the United Front 
Work Department of the municipal party committee, delivered a 
work report, entitled: "Clearly Understand the New Situation, 
Form a New Climate, and Make New Contributions To Realizing the 
Goal of Achieving Stability and Development in the Capital and 
Enabling It To Become Well-Off Three Years Ahead of Schedule," 
and made specific plans for implementing the guidelines of the 
national united front work conference and further strengthening 
the municipality's united front work. 
  Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, presided over the conference and gave a summing-up 
speech. He said: This conference is quite successful and the 
participants have conscientiously implemented the guidelines of 
the standing committee meeting of the municipal party committee. 
Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as a guidance, unceasingly enhance our 
understanding of the importance, strategic meaning, 
inevitability and necessity of united front work are the 
preconditions for successfully carrying out united front work 
under the new situation. At present, the united front is facing 
the new situation, new circumstances and new problems, and at 
the same time, it is also facing very good opportunities. The 
establishment of the socialist market economic system has opened 
up a vast world for united front work and has instilled positive 
factors into it. The broad masses of cadres on the united 
front should have a sense of urgency, seize the opportunity, 
put forward new ideas and create new experiences. 
  Li Zhijian demanded: After the conference, party committees 
at all levels should propose specific opinions in line with the 
reality of their own units; do practical things for the people 
outside the party and exert efforts to solve their practical 
problems; strengthen the building of united front work 
departments and urge united front work cadres to strengthen 
study, unceasingly raise their own quality and further create a 
new situation in the united front work of Beijing Municipality. 
  Wang Daming, chairman of the municipal CPPCC Committee, gave 
a speech on doing a better job in united front work. 
  Wang Tong, Yang Shichao, Qiang Wei, Tie Ying, Lu Yucheng, He 
Luli, Chen Dabai, Li Bokang and Zhu Zupu, and other leaders 
attended the conference.

  [Text] Beijing, January 16 (XINHUA) -- Beijing completed 
25 major infrastructure projects in 1993, involving a record 6.7 
billion yuan in investment, according to a meeting on urban 
construction. 
  Ten highway projects, including one to the capital airport 
and an expressway from Beijing to Shijiazhuang, capital of 
neighboring Hebei Province, added some 200 km to the city's road 
length and the length of expressways ranks first among Chinese 
cities. 
  Now, its more than 100 flyovers account for 70 percent of 
the 
country's total. Among them 22 were built last year. 
  Meanwhile, many projects which help improve citizens' daily 
life were completed in 1993, such as the second pipeline 
carrying natural gas from the Huabei oil field to Beijing and 
the upgrading of the Beijing coking factory, which will enable 
it to supply more coal gas. 
  Telecommunications also experienced robust growth. After 
182,000 more households gained private telephones last year 
Beijing vaulted to the top of the list of cities in this 
category. 
  Meanwhile, the environment has been greatly improved, with 
541 more hectares greened in 1993. 
  The city introduced 500 million U.S. dollars from companies 
in Hong Kong to undertake 18 infrastructure projects last year, 
including two highways and a museum of marine science. It also 
received 300 million U.S. dollars in loans from nine foreign 
governments and international financial organizations for 
infrastructure construction. 
  It is reported that this year Beijing is to inject 12.4 
billion yuan, mostly in the form of overseas investment, into 23 
infrastructure projects. And about seven billion yuan of this 
will go to highway projects.

  [Text] Beijing, January 16 (XINHUA) -- The scale of 
foreign-funded projects in China's capital of Beijing has 
expanded greatly since last year due to strong investment from 
more international big firms.

6.28 billion U.S. dollars flowed into Beijing last year, 
exceeding the total number in previous 14 years. 
  Meanwhile, the average foreign investment for per project

some 1.8 million U.S. dollars, 2.5 times that in 1992. 
  According to official sources, bringing investment into 
Beijing last year were more than 20 international giant 
companies, including the U.S.-based General Electric Inc., the 
ABB Traction Company of Sweden, Mitsui Bussam Co. Ltd of Japan 
and the Sun Base International (Holdings) of Hong Kong. 
  Li Ka Shing, chairman of the board of the Cheung Kong 
(Holdings) Ltd. Of Hong Kong, who signed a contract with Beijing 
firms a few days ago, said that improved investment environment 
and high- efficiency are the main factors attracting him. 
  In addition to the city's infrastructure, most of the 
foreign 
funds have gone to the property sector. 
  Official sources said that this year, the municipal 
government will pour some 35.5 billion yuan into the 
construction of the city's infrastructure, 31 percent more than 
in 1993.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Though "popular 
books" and sexually explicit materials are demanding a part of 
the Chinese capital's book market, classical literary works have 
remained high on the best seller list of Beijing, a recent poll 
shows. 
  The poll, conducted by the Beijing Institute of Social 
Psychology, shows that classical works like The Dream of 
Red , Besieged City, Family, 
Jane Eyre, and Gone With the Wind are 
still the favorite books of Beijing readers. 
  The poll received replies from 720 Beijing citizens, among 
whom are factory workers, government employees, students, 
teachers, researchers and company employees. Of them, 89.7 
percent received high school and university educations. 
  The poll shows that Qian Zhongshu, Liang Shiqiu and Lu Xun 
are the preferred writers for younger readers, followed by San 
Mao of Taiwan, Wang Shuo, the native Beijing writer, and Liang 
Yusheng and Jin Yong, both writers of Gongfu novels. 
  Beijing's middle-aged and older readers, however, like Lao 
She, Ba Jin and Lu Xun the most, followed by Ding Ling, Bing Xin 
and Zhou Zuoren. All of them are native writers. 
  The poll also sought out people's attitudes towards the 
increasing descriptions of sex in newly published literary books. 
  The poll found that nearly half of the Beijing readers hold 
a 
noncommittal attitude -- "not good, not bad" -- toward lengthy 
sex descriptions, while one-third of the readers marked it as "a 
bad thing," and 18 percent as "a good thing." 
  Among those against sex descriptions, 32.6 percent said that 
it is pandering to bad tastes, 30.2 percent said it does not 
conform to the Chinese way of expression, and 11.2 percent said 
it will lead to precocity in love affairs and even sexual 
assaults. 
  Among the surveyed readers in favor of more sex descriptions 
gave different reasons, 33.3 percent saying sex is a normal 
human need, another 20.5 percent saying sex is one of the 
beautiful things in human life, and 5.3 percent saying sex can 
make people forget unpleasant things. 
  When asked of the relations between their purchasing 
behavior 
and the purpose of their reading, 44.6 percent of the readers 
said they buy books according to their interest, and 34.7 
percent said their first consideration is practical use, while 
only 3.6 percent said they select books according to popularity. 
  Whereas popularity has for a time seemed to become the sole 
standard for publishers in making choices, organizers of the 
poll said their investigation is aimed at providing a more 
realistic guide for the publishers.

  [Summary] The provincial department for foreign economic 
relations and trade has noticeably strengthened the vitality of 
enterprises thanks to deepening reform and accelerating the 
reform of the enterprise managerial mechanism. 
  The statistical figures showed that in 1993, the province's 
import and export volume reached $2.345 billion, an increase of 
10.82 percent over 1992; and the increase rates of the export 
volumes of the ordinary trade, the enterprises involving foreign 
capital, and the barter trade were higher than the national 
average levels. Simultaneously, the province made rapid headway 
in the domestic trade, started to manage its export trade, and 
noticeably accelerated the pace of economic construction. 
However, the gap between the export volume of Hebei and those 
of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang whose ports opened to the 
outside world almost at the same time as ours was widened.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, the 
largest port city of north China, made strides in the use of 
foreign investment over the past year. 
  Information from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation reveals that in 1993 alone, the 
municipality approved the establishment of 3,538 foreign-funded 
projects, involving an agreed use of 2.256 billion U.S. dollars, 
both figures representing big increases compared with 
corresponding figures of the previous year. 
  According to local officials, more than half of the 
foreign-funded projects approved for establishment are located 
in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, the 
bonded area of Tianjin Port, and the Tianjin Industrial 
Development Zone of New Technology. A total of 1.18 billion 
U.S. dollars of the promised foreign investment went for the 
service trade. 
  To draw more overseas investors, local governments at 
various 
levels of the municipality worked hard in the past year to 
provide quality services, simplified approval procedures, and 
sponsored investment promotion events of various kinds, said the 
officials. 
  Thirteen well-known international consortia and 
transnational 
companies decided to invest money and expand their businesses in 
this north China port city last year, and 30 other international 
consortia and transnational firms continue to send personnel to 
investigate the actual situation of Tianjin in preparation for 
future investment, the officials disclosed. 
  So far, 1,100 foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin have 
begun official operation or have started economic activities. 
Last year, operational foreign-funded firms were reported to 
have completed 14 billion yuan in output value, making up 27.8 
percent of the municipality's total, and created 3.11 billion 
yuan in profits and taxes.

  [Text] Berlin, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Visiting top Chinese 
legislator Qiao Shi and Mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen today 
expressed the hope that the friendly ties between China and 
Berlin will further grow. 
  Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
Standing Committee, said at a meeting here this morning with 
Diepgen that Berlin has established good ties with the Chinese 
cities of Shanghai and Beijing. Efforts should be further made 
by the two sides to promote such cooperation, he added. 
  Diepgen said Berlin is willing to make full use of its 
advantages to expand its cooperation with China. 
  The mayor told Qiao that he is scheduled to visit China in 
April this year. 
  Qiao said the forthcoming visit by Diepgen will give new 
impetus to the ties between Berlin and the Chinese cities. 
  Germany is China's largest trading partner in Europe. 
Bilateral trade amounted to 6.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 
and last year it further increased to reach over nine billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to China last November 
enabled bilateral ties to enter a new stage. 
  Both Qiao and Diepgen expressed their confidence in the 
growth of ties between the two countries. 
  Qiao expressed the hope that foreign companies will invest 
in 
the infrastructure in China's central and western parts, which 
are less developed than the coastal areas, so as to facilitate 
their balanced economic development.

  [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese and German 
legislators both agreed today to further the ties of their 
parliaments. 
  The agreement came in talks between Qiao Shi, visiting 
chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing 
Committee, and his German counterpart Rita Suessmuth here this 
morning. 
  Qiao expressed his satisfaction with the growth of bilateral 
relations since the two countries established diplomatic ties. 
  He said recent years have witnessed rapid progress in 
bilateral ties, not only in economic trade, but also in culture, 
science, technology and education. 
  Bilateral ties have progressed to a new stage especially 
after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China last year, 
Qiao said. 
  Qiao noted the growing relationship between China's NPC and 
the German Federal Assembly, explaining how two German 
vice-presidents visited China in the past and he is now the 
first NPC chairman to visit Germany. 
  He expressed the belief that his visit will achieve 
successful results. 
  During the talks, Qiao formally invited Suessmuth to visit 
China at a time convenient to her. 
  Qiao also gave a full account of China's reforms and opening 
to the outside world, its economic construction and its legal 
system. 
  He said over the past 15 years, China's economy has 
developed 
rapidly and people's living standards have improved greatly. 
  The Chinese people can express their views freely, he 
stressed. 
  Extending her warm welcome to Qiao, Suessmuth spoke highly 
of 
China's economic growth and progress in safeguarding its 
stability. 
  Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC standing committee, 
participated in the talks.

<F P=106> ["CHINA DAILY Commentary": "Forging Closer Ties"] </F>
  [Text] National People's Congress [NPC] Chairman Qiao Shi 
set off yesterday on a trip to Western Europe, the first by an 
NPC Chairman since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. 
  He is visiting Germany, Switzerland and Austria to forge 
closer ties. 
  China's bilateral relations with these three countries have 
improved and expanded steadily in the last few years. This is 
because all four realize that developing good relations on the 
basis of "seeking common ground while setting aside differences" 
is in everyone's interests. 
  In the last two years high-level visits between the three 
countries and China have become ever more frequent, enhancing 
mutual understanding and boosting trade and economic ties. 
  In 1993, both Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky 
and 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl came to China accompanied by large 
groups of businessmen. 
  They carried home not only the warm friendship of the 
Chinese 
people but also enormous economic benefits in the form of new 
contracts of co-operation. 
  All the world now knows of the extremely rapid growth of 
China's economy in recent years, driven by the policies of 
reform and opening to the outside world. Great efforts are 
being made to switch China on to the track of the socialist 
market economy. And the developments so far have laid a solid 
foundation for further and faster expansion. 
  China's market has vast potential, and opportunities of 
economic co-operation with foreign countries are increasing. 
  As China focuses on economic construction, it naturally 
wants 
to encourage a peaceful and stable international environment. 
It is ready to establish and maintain normal and friendly 
relations with all other countries so long as they adhere to the 
commitments they have made to China. 
  At the beginning of 1993, Germany decided to ban the sale of 
arms to Taiwan, an integral part of Chinese territory. There is 
no doubt the increasingly close relations between Germany and 
China had much to do with this wise and correct decision. For 
to help to arm Taiwan is nothing short of interference in 
China's internal affairs. 
  Last Wednesday, China and France issued a joint communique, 
pledging to restore their traditional friendly relations and 
cooperation. 
  This was made possible only by the French Government's vow 
to 
authorize no firms to participate in arming Taiwan. 
  China is seeking friends all over the world but never at the 
expense of principle. Any country that claims truly to treasure 
friendship with China should consider if its deeds and words are 
consistent. 
  The three countries on Qiao's itinerary each have their own 
distinctive features and strong points. They and China will 
benefit from stronger trade, economic and cultural ties. 
  Qiao's visit will mark another milestone in relations 
between 
each of them and China. Let us wish him a happy journey and 
complete success.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Yong: "Sino-French Ties Enter A New Era"] </F>
  [Text] The normalization of Sino-French relations last 
week will yield economic benefits for both countries, a Chinese 
trade official said. 
  "We welcome French enterprises to compete in China on a fair 
footing," Tong Jiemin, deputy director general for European 
affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation, told Business Weekly. 
  Tong pointed to the "vast potential" of bilateral 
collaboration in such fields as nuclear power, transportation, 
telecommunications, chemicals and agriculture. 
  He added that prospects are good for joint development 
between medium- and small-sized enterprises in both countries. 
  Tong's remarks followed last week's Sino-French joint 
communique restoring traditionally friendly relations on the 
basis of the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic 
relations. 
  "Our two economies complement each other very well and their 
cooperation had its heyday in the late 1980s," Tong said. 
  But such ties suffered a severe setback when France decided 
to sell weapons to Taiwan. 
  Now the French Government has vowed "not to authorize any 
French enterprises to participate in arming Taiwan." 
  Last week's joint communique said French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur will visit China soon. 
  Tong said France became China's fourth largest trading 
partner in the European Union (European Community) last year, 
when bilateral trade in the first 11 months increased to $2.47 
billion. 
  At the same time China's trade with Western Europe hit $24.1 
billion, up 50.5 percent over 1992. 
  China imported $13.9 billion worth of goods, up 46.2 
percent, 
suffering a deficit of more than $3 billion. 
  Tong said Western Europe, in the wide sense of including the 
five Nordic countries, Austria and Switzerland, had surpassed 
the United States as China's third largest overseas trading 
partner, behind Hong Kong (and Macao) and Japan. 
  Germany, Italy, Britain and France rank among China's top 10 
trading partners. 
  Germany took the lead as its trade with China from January 
to 
November last year soared 64.3 percent to $8.3 billion. China's 
imports grew 63 percent to $5 billion and exports surged 66.3 
percent to $3.3 billion. 
  Germany's lead in trade with China was cemented last year 
when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China and clinched export 
contracts worth several billion deutchmarks, including contracts 
for the Guangzhou Subway Project. 
  "Western Europe, as a whole, is a big and well-integrated 
market, which has a sound prospect for cooperating with China," 
Tong said. 
  From 1978 to June 1993 Western European countries committed 
$5.7 billion to 2,146 projects in China. About $2.25 billion of 
the pledged investment has been used. 
  During the past 15 years, Western Europe has promised to 
provide China with $11.7 billion in loans, or more than 
one-third of the $31.4 billion foreign governments have loaned 
to China. 
  Tong said $10.9 billion had been promised in contracts by 
Western European companies, of which $10 billion has been used.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by XINHUA reporter Shen Xiaoquan (3088 1321 </F>
3123): "A New Page in Sino-Franco Relations"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Chinese and French 
Governments issued a joint communique on 12 January declaring 
that the two countries should restore their traditional friendly 
and cooperative relations on the basis of the principle on which 
they established diplomatic ties. In the communique, the 
Chinese Government restated its consistent position on the 
Taiwan issue, and the French Government recognized that the PRC 
Government is the sole legitimate government of China, that 
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and it 
undertook not to approve in the future arms sales to Taiwan by 
French enterprises. It was announced in the communique that 
French Prime Minister Balladur will pay a formal visit to China 
in the near future. The joint communique indicated that 
Sino-Franco relations have begun to be restored after a 
difficult period. 
  As all know, in November 1992, the former French Socialist 
Party government, in ignoring the Chinese Government's strong 
opposition and principled and stern representations, approved 
the sale of 60 Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft to Taiwan. This 
action undermined the foundation of the friendly relations 
between China and France and resulted in a serious retrogression 
in bilateral relations. 
  In March 1993, the new French government headed by Prime 
Minister Balladur took office. In April, French business 
circles appealed through the press to the new government to take 
action to relax Sino-Franco relations, which had deadlocked, and 
they stressed that the French side "should take the first 
political step." Later, former French President Giscard 
d'Estang, former Prime Minister Chirac, and other French 
political leaders called for improving relations with China. 
French Foreign Minister Juppe separately issued a statement at 
the end of 1993 and early this year in which he expressed the 
hope of "restoring relations of greater trust with China at an 
early date." 
  China responded positively to France's gesture. Prime 
Minister Balladur sent special envoy Friedmann to visit Beijing 
in July and December of last year for consultations on restoring 
Sino-Franco relations. On 12 January, the two sides issued a 
joint communique declaring that China and France have restored 
their traditional friendly and cooperative relations. It can be 
said that this indicated that Sino-Franco relations have come 
out of their low ebb and that a new chapter has been opened in 
their relations. 
  The improvement in Sino-Franco relations was made possible 
due to various factors. 
  First, tense Sino-Franco relations do not conform to 
France's 
long-term interests. Sino-Franco economic and trade cooperation 
is mainly in the nuclear power industry, transportation, energy 
industry, and other technical projects. According to statistics 
provided by the French side, as of this date, the amount in 
contracts that the French side has lost totals 6 billion francs. 
Some people have estimated that if Sino-Franco relations 
continued to deteriorate, its losses would reach 30 billion 
francs. French business circles have suffered seriously, and 
therefore their call to improve Sino-Franco relations had been 
the loudest. 
  The East Asia region currently is the most economically 
vigorous region in the world. In particular, since it adopted 
the policy of reform and opening up, China's economy has grown 
rapidly and in a sustained manner, drawing worldwide attention. 
Asia's prosperity and the West's economic recession have formed 
a sharp contrast. Currently, Western countries, including the 
United States, have set their eyes on Asia and are attempting to 
seek markets there. Among EC member states, Germany has led the 
way. In the first half of 1993 alone, Germany doubled the 
amount of the sophisticated technological goods that it exported 
to China. The tense Sino- Franco political relations have 
directly affected France's exports of technological goods to 
China. 
  Second, China's international status has kept on increasing. 
Both China and France are permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, and both of them possess nuclear weapons; therefore, in 
the current turbulent and unstable international situation, the 
two countries must hold consultations more often and have closer 
cooperation to make contributions to maintaining world peace and 
stability. The Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle in November 
was both a shock and a push to France. France, which has always 
embraced an independent foreign policy, felt that it needed to 
coordinate with China on such major international issues as 
banning nuclear testing and arms control. 
  This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of 
Sino-Franco diplomatic relations. In 1964, because of the 
personal concern of General de Gaulle, Chairman Mao Zedong, and 
Premier Zhou Enlai, China and France established diplomatic 
ties, making France the first major Western country to establish 
diplomatic relations with PRC and winning wide international 
praise. The achievements of the development of Sino-Franco 
relations over the last 30 years were hard-won. Cooperation 
between the two countries has a solid foundation; China's market 
potential is huge, and France has an advantage in technological 
goods -- the two countries' economies are highly complementary 
to each other. We believe that as long as the two countries 
strictly abide by the principle on which they established their 
diplomatic ties and the principle laid down in the joint 
communique, Sino-Franco relations will gradually improve and 
will develop.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Sustained Momentum With UK Is Sought"] </F>
  [Text] China hopes to maintain the momentum of trade it 
has developed with Britain over the past two years, a senior 
Chinese trade official said last week. 
  But Tong Jiemin, deputy director general for European 
affairs 
at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, 
suggested that Britain's undesired stance over the Hong Kong 
issue could have a crippling effect. 
  "Bilateral economic and trade relations can hardly escape 
damage from an uncooperative and unfriendly Britain," Tong said. 
  "That is what China won't like to see." 
  International analysts have expressed fears that Britain 
could follow the example of France, whose trade with China was 
set back by political skirmishes. 
  Tong declined to make any comment on this speculation. 
  Instead, he stressed that trade between China and Britain 
has 
grown over the past two years. 
  "We welcome large British enterprises, financial groups and 
multi-nationals to come and compete on the Chinese market," he 
said. 
  Tong suggested that British firms consider investing in 
energy, natural resources, infrastructure and other technical- 
and capital- intensive projects. 
  He stressed that Britain has been an important trading 
partner of China, and that each can help meet the other's needs. 
  China mainly buys equipment systems, machinery, metals, 
minerals and petrochemical products from Britain while selling 
mostly textiles and garments, ferrous metals and 
light-industrial appliances. 
  Chinese customs figures show that Sino-British trade in the 
first 11 months of 1993 reached $3 billion, up 85.6 percent over 
the corresponding period in 1992. 
  In that time, China's exports grew by 109 percent to $1.63 
billion, while imports increased 63.7 percent to $1.37 billion.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter in London: "China Plans Large-Scale </F>
Capital Raising, and 20 Enterprises Are To List on Hong Kong 
Stock Market in 1994"] 
  [Text] London, 16 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Professor Liu Hongru, 
chairman of China's Securities Supervision and Administration 
Committee, said here that 20 state-owned enterprises would list 
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this year, and some would also 
have secondary listings on the New York and London exchanges. A 
small number of these enterprises would have their primary 
listings in New York. In addition, feasibility studies on 
listing shares of some state-owned enterprises on the London 
Stock Exchange or in southeast Asian markets, such as Singapore, 
are also being conducted. 
  At a promotion hosted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, 
Professor Liu Hongru revealed that in 1994, China's securities 
business will undergo its greatest changes. This year, over 100 
companies will list their shares on the stock exchange, raising 
a total of 5.5 billion yuan. 
  He said that the two existing stock exchanges in China are 
located in Shenzhen and Shanghai, both of which are in the 
southern part of the country. This limits their capacity. The 
authorities are now considering the establishment of another 
stock exchange in the north of the country. 
  As for the future prospects of the securities markets in 
Shanghai and Hong Kong, Liu said that there are many differences 
between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a financial center 
in which international investors had great confidence. After 
1997, the "one country, two systems" policy will enable Hong 
Kong to maintain its current status. China attaches great 
importance to Hong Kong's bridging role. 
  Professor Liu Hongru is visiting Britain at the invitation 
of 
the British Government. During his visit, he will meet with 
British officials from the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the 
Department of Trade and Industry, and the stock exchange. He 
said that China should learn from Britain's finance industry. 
  When asked whether the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's 
political arrangements would affect Sino-British economic and 
trade cooperation and the performances of H-shares in Hong Kong, 
he said that the number of Chinese enterprises listed on the 
Hong Kong Stock Exchange would increase from nine to 20 this 
year, and the Hang Seng Index had topped 10,000 points. These 
facts gave the answer. 
  Liu Hongru also talked about China's macro-control measures. 
He said that in 1994, measures to prohibit real estate 
companies from listing on stock exchanges would be relaxed, but 
only those engaged in renovating old urban areas and 
constructing houses for ordinary residents would be allowed to 
list. Companies engaged in real estate speculation would still 
be forbidden to list. 
  At present, six state-owned Chinese enterprises are listed 
on 
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and another three are arranging 
listings. Lee Yik-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong Joint 
Exchange, said that the three Chinese enterprises would be 
listed in February or March.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter From Britain" by staff reporter Li Wenzheng </F>
(2621 2429 2398): "British Conservative Government Again 
Shocked by Scandal"] 
  [Text] London (RENMIN RIBAO)--With the arrival of the new 
year, more scandals in British political circles have been 
brought to light, and several government ministers have been 
forced to take the blame and resign. As a result, the 
reputation of the Conservative government is going downhill, and 
the position of Prime Minister John Major is becoming more 
precarious each day. 
  At the beginning of this year, British society was shocked 
by 
a scandal where Environment Minister Tim Yeo had an illegitimate 
child. Because this minister had always been an advocate of 
John Major's new idea of "back to basics," the mass media raised 
the issue: If it attached great importance to "traditional 
values," the Conservative Party should not act against family 
and individual moral standards either. Facing a public outcry 
for Yeo's resignation, Prime Minister John Major claimed that 
"the illegitimate child" issue was a private matter for Yeo and 
that it was up to him to decide whether he should resign from 
office. John Major's remarks aroused greater resentment among 
the public. As a result, Yeo's constituency demanded that he 
resign immediately, while criticism from the media also 
intensified. 
  The forced resignation of Tim Yeo was followed by another 
scandal. Secretary to the Cabinet Alan Duncan went so far as to 
buy a council house illegally for 50 percent less than the 
market price, thus earning a profit of nearly 200,000 pounds. 
Then, on 10 January, the Earl of Caithness, the minister of 
state for transport, announced his resignation. It was 
disclosed that the cause of his resignation was the suicide of 
his wife, who could not bear the minister's extra-marital 
affairs. 
  If we say that the disgraceful series above only impaired 
the 
reputation of individuals, then another scandal revealed by 
major British newspapers the other day could do great harm to 
the image of the Conservative Party as a whole. 
  According to a 250-page report released by the relevant 
auditing department in London, Westminster City Council, which 
is claimed to be the "flagship" council of the Conservative 
Party in Greater London (and which includes major commercial and 
tourist areas in London proper), had misappropriated up to 21.25 
million pounds of public funds to canvass for the Conservative 
Party. This incident immediately gave rise to a public uproar, 
and some people believe that "the Conservative Party is corrupt 
and that they have abandoned basic traditional values." 
  In recent years, Britain has been plagued by a worsening 
economic recession and drastic increases in unemployment and 
crime rates, and complaints are heard everywhere. People from 
Britain's political and economic circles have always blamed the 
leaders of the Conservative Party for "their lack of creativity" 
as well as their inability to shoulder the heavy duty of leading 
Britain. Under such circumstances, in order to establish a new 
image for and restore the prestige of the Conservative Party, 
John Major raised the slogan of "back to basics" at the party's 
annual conference in October 1993. The essence of his slogan was 
to implement basic economic policies, including maintaining a 
low inflation rate, advocating free markets, and supporting the 
development of enterprises; attaching greater importance to 
basic social values, such as exercising self restraint, 
respecting the law, and showing concern for others; and to 
restoring the traditional values of "being honest and upright in 
one's way, and being particular about one's manners." For a 
time, the public cherished the hope that Major's slogan could 
inject a certain vigor into British society, which has been 
dejected and apathetic for many years. That is why public 
resentment is soaring after the moral scandals inside the 
government were exposed, and people have deemed the Major 
administration a "hypocritical" government. It is clear that 
the accusations made in political circles and the media have 
already gone beyond the moral standards of individuals and have 
touched upon the credibility and reputation of the leaders of 
the Conservative Party. 
  The results of the latest opinion polls show clearly that 
the 
Conservative Party has fallen behind the Labor Party by 25 
percentage points, with an approval rate of a mere 26 percent. 
People generally believe that the unceasing scandals in the 
Conservative Party have made the Major administration, which 
already suffers low prestige among the public, to further lose 
the trust of the British public. It is probable that the Major 
administration will choose to reshuffle the cabinet at an early 
date; otherwise, it will surely suffer losses in the local 
council elections and the European Parliament elections 
scheduled for this May and June. By then, the problems may be 
so serious that one or two resignations by ministers will be to 
no avail.

<F P=106> ["Letter from Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Britain </F>
Should Not Attempt To Extend Its Colonial Rule"] 
  [Text] Dear Brother: 
  The Sino-British talks on the 1994/1995 election issue have 
become totally bankrupt because of the British side's deliberate 
sabotage. This was an outcome the Chinese side did not wish to 
see. However, just like a popular saying goes: "The rain must 
fall from the sky, and one's own mother must remarry." There 
are things in the world that are independent of people's good 
wishes, and cannot be changed. 
  The many tricks the British side has played since China set 
out the demand to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong are 
still fresh in people's memories! In the talks between the 
Chinese and British Governments on settling the Hong Kong issue, 
the British side continuously set out all sorts of ideas that 
ran counter to its promise, and the most famous ones were 
"exchanging sovereignty for the right to rule," and the demand 
on the Chinese side to refrain from stationing the PLA in Hong 
Kong, and so forth. All this naturally met solemn rejection 
from China. The talks lasted 22 rounds and two years, and 
eventually the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed. 
  China hoped that the British side would abide by the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration like its Chinese counterpart 
during the transition period, but now it seems that the true 
nature of the colonialists will never change. Whenever there 
are some changes in the world situation, they will do everything 
they can to essentially prolong their rule in Hong Kong. Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten has dished up his "constitutional 
reform package" under the pretext that it would give "democracy" 
to Hong Kong residents. However, he forget that the very title 
and power of Hong Kong governor is none other than a symbol of 
colonialism. Would it not be the greatest joke on earth for a 
Hong Kong governor to give democracy to people of the colony?! 
Only if he removes himself from office first. No wonder some 
public opinion in Hong Kong hit the nail on the head by saying: 
There is no democracy to speak of in a colony. Should there be 
democracy, it would not be a colony. 
  Therefore, it is not difficult to explain why Chris Patten 
was in a hurry to change the existing system and pursue his 
so-called "constitutional reform" as soon as he arrived in Hong 
Kong. His objective was obvious enough, namely, to make 
arrangements for those people who could act on the order of 
their British masters in the three-tier framework. The funnier 
thing was that this Hong Kong governor should have forced such a 
body on the SAR [Special Administration Region] Government after 
1997. Again, he forgot that this body of his, namely, the 
Legislative Council, the Executive Council, and the two 
municipal councils, are all components in the constitutional 
framework of the British Hong Kong Authorities. Naturally, they 
must be disbanded with the termination of British rights in 
administration and control over Hong Kong on 30 June 1997. That 
will be the inevitable outcome of China restoring its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Britain terminating its rule over 
Hong Kong. By then, Hong Kong's three-tier framework will be 
reorganized according to the stipulation in the Basic Law and 
the National People's Congress decision. That is the Chinese 
Government's solemn position, and it is not at all vague! 
  Some British politicians like Chris Patten have continued 
their colonialist daydreaming. Regretfully, it is the end of 
the 20th century, not the 19th Century, and the sun of "Great 
Britain" has long set. The Chinese Government is no longer the 
government of the late Qing Dynasty. China has joined the ranks 
of world powers. It is precisely to redress national shame and 
to end the ugliest phenomena of colonial rule in modern history 
that China recovers Hong Kong. The world's peace-loving people 
support the Chinese Government's position. It is in vain for 
Chris Patten and his ilk to attempt to maintain their rule on 
the last colony no matter what tricks they play. 
  Deng Xiaoping has longed foreseen how the British Hong Kong 
Government would act, and set out five issues that "the Chinese 
side does not hope to see surface" during the transition period, 
of which the fourth point was that it was hoped that the British 
Hong Kong Government would refrain from organizing a body on its 
own and force it on the Hong Kong SAR Government in the future. 
We should like to advise the British Hong Kong Government to 
return to the track of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
Basic Law, the Sino-British understanding and agreement on the 
Hong Kong issue, and stop doing foolish things. The only way 
out is to cooperate in sincerity to ensure Hong Kong's 
prosperity, stability, and steady transition. 
  In actual fact, the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong 
residents do not agree to the ways of British politicians 
including Chris Patten. Even some figures with vision in 
British political circles and British entrepreneurs and 
businessmen have criticized those politicians, saying that those 
politicians were not thinking of Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability, but of dusting their political cloaks with gold, and 
dressing themselves as "heroes." They do not know that such 
"heroes" are actually laughingstocks. 
  You also know that it was the British side who first set 
out the "through train" issue. However, because the British 
side has set up hurdles one after another and it tabled part of 
the "constitutional reform package" in the Hong Kong Legislative 
Council when no Sino-British agreement had been reached, it 
thoroughly soured the talks. That being the case, the 
convergence of the constitutional system will be impossible, and 
there will be no "through train" for the three-tier framework. 
The stable transition of Hong Kong Government will be affected 
and the responsibility totally rests with the British side. 
  Britain has ruled Hong Kong for some 150 years, and seized 
tremendous wealth from the island. Thus Hong Kong is where the 
great interest of Britain lies. That being the case, some 
British politicians are becoming somewhat muddleheaded, and 
believe that the merits of Hong Kong's prosperity today should 
go to them, which really is taking the merits that belong to 
Heaven as their own. Hong Kong's prosperity relies on the 
diligence and hard work of Hong Kong residents through all the 
generations, and the all-out support of all the Chinese people 
in the hinterland, especially in the dozen or so years since 
reform and opening up began. The economies of the two places 
are mutually beneficial, and are so close that they cannot be 
separated. China has already promised that it will continue to 
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. China has always 
been good to its word! If the British side is able to 
cooperate, that is fine, and we can ensure that its interests in 
Hong Kong will remain intact. Should it be otherwise, China 
will have confidence and ability, too, to maintain Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability. 
  China will not change its mind in recovering its sovereignty 
over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. Neither will China change its 
mind in implementing the Basic Law, "one country, two system," 
and "Hong Kong residents ruling Hong Kong" after that date. By 
then, all things incompatible with the Basic Law will have to be 
overthrown, and British colonialism will disappear from Hong 
Kong. This is a historical inevitability!

  [Excerpts] The provincial government held a meeting for 
all its 1994 members in Fuzhou yesterday. Among those present 
at the meeting were all the members of the provincial 
government, officials from all the prefectural governments, 
mayors of cities directly under provincial government 
jurisdiction, people in charge of relevant government 
departments, some people in charge of universities and colleges, 
as well as people in charge of the provincial armed police 
corps, the provincial frontier guard corps, and the provincial 
fire brigade. 
  The main topics of this meeting were to sum up government 
work in 1993, to arrange government work in 1994, and to propose 
measures to ensure the fulfillment of the reform and development 
objectives and tasks. Provincial CPC secretary and Governor Jia 
Qinglin made a speech entitled: "Working in Full Cooperation, 
Carrying Out Hard Struggle, and Ensuring the Smooth Fulfillment 
of Reform and Development." 
  He said: Last year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, people throughout the 
province made great achievements in seizing the opportunity to 
deepen reform and expedite development. The province achieved 
82.5 billion yuan in GNP, an increase of 25.4 percent over the 
previous year, quadrupling the target seven years ahead of 
schedule. Gross agricultural output value amounted to 32 
billion yuan, an increase of 8.9 percent. Gross output value of 
townships and towns amounted to 101.3 billion yuan. Gross 
industrial output value amounted to 135 billion yuan. Marked 
achievements were made in the construction of basic facilities, 
with 13 key projects put into operation or basically completed. 
The people's standard of living improved. The per capita 
income of the people in cities and towns amounted to 2,600 yuan 
and peasants' per capita net income amounted to 1,150 yuan. 
Fifteen practical programs the provincial party committee and 
government carried out for the people's benefit were basically 
completed. 
  Jia Qinglin pointed out that in last year's government work, 
there were still some aspects which were not up to our 
expectations. Agriculture was still weak as the foundation, 
farmland was reduced by 100,000 mu, there was a serious lack of 
funds for key construction projects, state-owned enterprises 
were seriously short of circulating funds, transportation and 
communications were overloaded, energy was in short supply, 
market prices increased by a wide margin and topped the 10 
percent rate originally set, and there were still many problems 
in maintaining safety in production and social order. Further 
efforts are still necessary for a clean and diligent 
administration. All levels of government should pay full 
attention to these and overcome and resolve them. 
  On government work in 1994, Jia Qinglin said that this year 
was an important year for speeding up reform and development. 
The objective of the province's economic work is to enable GNP 
to reach 91 billion yuan or to bring about a GNP increase of 
more than 1 billion yuan over 1993; to invest 22.5 billion yuan 
in state-owned fixed assets, an increase 21 percent; investment 
in basic facilities construction will amount to 12.8 billion 
yuan; foreign capital and total exports will amount to $7 
billion; and foreign capital actually used will amount to $3.5 
billion, an increase of 16.7 percent; revenue will amount to 
10.8 billion yuan, an increase of 11 percent; commodity price 
rises will be controlled to below 10 percent; the per capita 
income of the people in cities and towns will amount to 2,712 
yuan; peasants' per capita net income will amount to 1,300 yuan; 
and the natural population growth rate will be kept under 12.59 
percent [figure as heard]. 
  To fulfill these targets, Jia Qinglin requested governments 
at all levels pay close attention to six aspects which have an 
important bearing on the overall situation. 
  The first is to maintain the sustained, speedy, and healthy 
development of the national economy; the second is to properly 
organize the implementation all reforms; the third is to give 
prominence to structural optimization, strengthen management, 
and improve efficiency; the fourth is to develop all social 
undertakings; the fifth is to maintain social stability; and the 
sixth is to strengthen the self-improvement of governments at 
all levels. 
  Jia Qinglin added: An important feature of this year's 
reform is that, in aiming to establish a new structure, reform 
will be introduced to state-owned enterprises, the financial and 
monetary system, the planning system, the investment system, the 
foreign trade system, the state-owned asset management system, 
and the social insurance system. The industrial structural 
adjustment should be focused on strengthening agriculture as the 
foundation, the construction of basic facilities and basic 
industries; transforming processing industries; and developing 
tertiary industries. The agricultural structural adjustment 
should be carried out under market guidance, based on stable 
grain production, aimed at reaping a good harvest, and focused 
on cultivating high- quality and high-yield agriculture as well 
as secondary and tertiary industries. Agriculture, forestry, 
animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries should be 
developed comprehensively. [passage omitted] 
  Enterprises and departments should boldly accept the 
challenges of reform and the market economy, constantly improve 
their management, and strengthen their competitiveness. 
  Jia Qinglin pointed out: At present leading cadres at all 
levels should pay attention to major issues affecting reform and 
overall development, go to the grass-roots level, build ties 
with the masses, carry out investigations, and help resolve 
problems. Leading cadres and institutions should take the lead 
in observing discipline and practicing a clean administration 
and self-control. Leaders at all levels should concentrate their 
efforts on doing something practical for the masses to win their 
trust and support.

  [Text] Last year taxation departments at all levels 
throughout the province registered 11.585 billion yuan in tax 
collections, the highest record in taxation history. Last year 
Fujian's gross industrial output value increased by 48 percent 
over the previous year; industrial growth at the township level 
and above was estimated 33 percent; industrial and commercial 
taxation increased by 51.2 percent over the previous year; last 
year's circulating tax increased by 53.7 over the previous year; 
other taxes increased by 39.5 over the previous year. All this 
shows that the speedy economic growth has increased revenue from 
circulating taxes. 
  Last year, taxes collected from three-capital enterprises 
amounted to 1.334 billion yuan, an increase of 86.9 percent over 
the previous year; other types of economic tax collections

  [Text] Nanjing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province is promoting the market mechanism to spur its economic 
growth. 
  Located in the Chang Jiang river delta, the province took 
the 
lead in the country in introducing the market mechanism. 
  Economists here agree that the rise of 18 percent in the 
gross product last year was the result of the adoption of such a 
mechanism. 
  According to statistics, between 90 percent and 95 percent 
of 
local economic operations are under market regulation, and more 
and more enterprises are becoming independent corporations. 
  With a flourishing processing industry, Jiangsu had set up 
4,600 markets for farm and sideline products, and industrial 
goods by the end of last year. 
  These markets now offer 95 percent of the production 
materials and equipment for the various economic entities in the 
province. 
  A survey shows that Jiangsu has 589 share-holding companies 
and 495 companies with responsibility for their own profits or 
losses. 
  More than 5,000 small enterprises have been leased out and 
545 merged into other, more efficient, organizations. 
  One tenth of the 100,000 rural industrial enterprises in the 
province employ the share-holding system, and 110 rural 
industrial enterprise groups have been formed. 
  Last year saw the industrial output value of rural 
industrial 
enterprises account for two-thirds of the province's total. 
  In addition, Jiangsu's improved investment conditions have 
drawn a surge of interest from overseas business people. 
  At present, the province has more than 10,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises with contractual investment totalling 18 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  More than 400 enterprise groups in the province are being 
encouraged to employ share-holding systems this year in a bid to 
compete better in the market.

  [Text] According to information and statistics on economic 
and social development released at a news briefing given by the 
provincial government this morning, Jiangxi kept a strong 
momentum of overall rapid economic growth in 1993. The 
province's gross domestic product [GDP] totaled 68.6 billion 
yuan, an increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year if 
calculated by comparable prices. As far as this is concerned, 
primary industry increased by 4.5 percent, secondary industry 
increased by 31.2 percent, and tertiary industry increased by 
12.5 percent. The province's per- capita GDP is expected to 
reach 1,742 yuan, a net increase of 307 yuan over the previous 
year. This growth was the highest annual growth since the 
introduction of reform and opening up. The province's 
comprehensive economic strength has obviously increased. 
  The province's economic development trend over the past year 
bears the following characteristics: 
  1. The rural economy has been flourishing, and the basis of 
agriculture has been further intensified. Agricultural 
production increased comprehensively, and the optimization 
process of the agricultural structure continues. The total 
grain output overdid the target set in the beginning of the year 
despite a decrease in growing area and serious natural 
disasters. The output of industrial crops increased by a wide 
margin, with the outputs of cotton, oil-bearing crops, silkworm 
cocoons, tea, and flue-cured tobacco all hitting all time highs. 
Non-agricultural production sectors developed rapidly in rural 
areas, with township and town enterprises enjoying a 92.2 
percent growth in their gross output value and emerging as the 
greatest growing sector of the economy in the province. 
  2. Industrial production grew rapidly, and both industrial 
production and its economic efficiency improved remarkably. The 
industrial growth pattern has gradually changed from the 
investment- pulled mode into the investment- and 
consumption-pulled mode. Light and heavy industries were 
tending to develop side by side in a more harmonious manner, 
collective-run and foreign-funded industrial enterprises kept 
booming, while large and medium-sized industrial enterprises 
played the role as an economic mainstay, and state-owned 
industrial enterprises enjoyed steady growth. 
  3. The province's performance has been prominent in project 
construction, with the construction of infrastructure further 
intensified. While a moderate investment scale was maintained, 
the investment structure has been further optimized. The 
remarkable increase in investment was mostly translated into an 
tremendous increase in investment in infrastructure. Smooth 
progress was made in key construction projects. Both the 10 key 
infrastructure projects and 18 key equipment updating and 
technological transformation projects which were to be completed 
by the end of the year as planned in the beginning of the year 
were all completed as scheduled. 
  4. The income of urban and rural residents continued to 
increase. The peasants' per-capita net annual income is expected 
to reach 870 yuan or more, an increase of 13.3 percent over the 
previous year. With the inflation factor taken into account, the 
actual increase will be 4.6 percent, the widest annual increase 
margin since the introduction of reform and opening up in the 
province. The staff and workers' average wage income was 2,500 
yuan, an increase of 16.1 percent. The urban residents' 
per-capita income to be spent as living expenditure increased by 
26.8 percent, or about 10 percent if with the inflation factor 
taken into account, the highest growth per year since reform and 
opening up. 
  5. The market was brisk and prosperous. The province's total 
volume of retail sales increased by 21.2 percent over the 
previous year, or actually about 10 percent if with the 
inflation factor is taken into account. The growth trend of the 
retail market showed a pattern of increasingly sharp increase, 
with the whole year's increase margin recorded at 3.4 percentage 
point above that for the first half of the year. The margin of 
price increase on the capital goods market was being narrowed, 
while the shortage in supply was being eased, and the end of the 
year saw ample supply. 
  6. The banking situation was stable, with the increase in 
the 
balance of deposits always higher than the increase in the 
balance of loans, and the financial revenue increasing pretty 
rapidly. The province's financial revenue totaled 6.56 billion 
yuan, an increase of 1.54 billion yuan or 30.8 percent over the 
previous year, the highest annual growth ever achieved by the 
province. The province's financial revenue overdid its 
financial expenditure in the year. 
  7. The reform was being intensified and the extent of 
opening 
up to the outside world was constantly being increased in the 
year. The foreign investment funds utilized in the year 
increased by 72 percent over the previous year. 
  The above information shows that in 1993 the province's 
economy developed in a wholesome manner and along a good trend. 
  The province did come across some difficulties and problems 
in the process of economic development. First, flood and 
waterlogging caused great losses; second, the margin of price 
increase was too wide for a while; third, bottlenecks that 
restrain economic growth have not been eased; and fourth, some 
enterprises are still facing great difficulties in business 
operation.

  [Text] In his speech at the provincial security work 
conference that was held on the morning of 15 January, Jiang 
Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed 
out: We should accurately estimate the current social order; 
correctly handle the relationship of reform, development, and 
stability; and realistically achieve the work regarding the 
political stability of society. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: The provincial political and economic 
situation and the social order of the province were good in the 
past year. The overall situation of the province was stable. 
However, at the time of fully affirming the security work 
achievements and the good main stream of the social order, we 
should face up to the existing problems and never lower our 
guard against the grim situation of social order. We should 
persist in the dialectical viewpoints of seeking truth from 
facts and dividing one into two and comprehensively and 
accurately analyze and judge the current situation of social 
order. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Reform, development, and 
stability are the main tasks at present and in the foreseeable 
future. Reform is motivation. Development is a central link. 
Stability is conditions. They are unified with and supplement 
one another. The current tasks for reform and development are 
extremely heavy, so do the tasks for stability. Thus, the 
leading cadres at various levels, particularly the top and 
second top leaders, should conscientiously implement the 
regulations that all achievements would be negated when social 
order is not good and conscientiously undertake the political 
responsibility for safeguarding stability. To be concerned with 
the political trends, we should study the work relating to 
stability. We should pay attention to the work relating to 
political and social stability just as what we have paid 
attention to the economic work. We should grasp the security 
work and the overall management of social order just as what we 
have grasped the work regarding to reform and opening up, 
consistently and firmly attend to the social stability work, and 
ensure the peacefulness of the localities. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: The security work and the overall 
management of social order must not be suspended but should only 
be developed, and must not be weakened but should be 
strengthened. We should exert great efforts to strengthen the 
security work; and comprehensively promote the overall 
management of social order. In line with the requirements for 
safeguarding political and social stability, we should 
strengthen the struggle of the concealed front in the political 
sphere and deal blows to hostile forces. The economic front 
should eliminate economic disputes and deal blows to economic 
criminal activities. The social front should mediate the 
disputes between the people and accurately handle the internal 
contradictions between the people. The public security front 
should sternly deal blows to criminal offenders, strengthen the 
management of social order, and achieve the overall improvement 
of social order. To ensure the overall improvement of social 
order, we should persist in the principle of paying equal 
attention to dealing blows to and guarding against criminal 
activities and the principle of treating a disease by looking 
into both its root cause and symptoms with the focus on 
eliminating the root cause and comprehensively carry out the 
principles of [words indistinct]. The organs especially in 
charge of the work in this regard should persist in the mass 
line and emphatically [words indistinct]. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The party and government leaders 
at various levels should fully understand the importance and 
urgency of strengthening the construction of the security front, 
realistically regard it as a great matter, and conscientiously 
attend to it. In regard to the issue of strengthening the 
construction of the security worker contingents, we should first 
strengthen the construction of the leading bodies of the 
security departments. Only when the officers are strictly 
disciplined will the police be sternly administered. We should 
exert efforts to upgrade the political quality and professional 
abilities of the cadres and policemen and to have each and every 
comrade on the security front be competent for his jobs. 
  To strengthen the construction of the security front, we 
should conscientiously implement the principle of sternly 
administering the police. The units with serious problems 
should be determined to conduct consolidation. The personnel 
who are neither qualified nor suitable to work at the security 
front should timely be readjusted. Criminals should sternly be 
punished according to laws. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: Strengthening the party's leadership 
over the security work is an important principle that the party 
has consistently persisted in as well as a fundamental guarantee 
for achieving the security work. In line with the requirements 
of the central authorities and the province, the localities 
should sign letters of responsibility with those at the next 
lower levels. Through implementation of this measure, we should 
have the principal leading comrades at various levels across the 
province better take on the political responsibility for 
guaranteeing the local peacefulness. In line with the principle 
that whoever takes charge of the work should assume 
responsibility for the fulfillment of the assigned tasks, all 
localities and units should watch over their own doors and well 
manage their own personnel. The principal responsible persons 
of the localities with problems should be called to accounts. 
We should realistically solve the real problems within the 
security departments. The general principle governing the input 
to the security departments is to take the economic development 
[words indistinct]. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the provincial government, also made a 
speech at the conference. 
  Approaching from the angle of the government work, he set 
forth specific opinions on how to strengthen the security work. 
  He said: The 1994 reform measures are more concentrated and 
dynamic than those in the past 14 years. Therefore, the 
security front is confronted with the extremely arduous tasks. 
We would rather overestimate than underestimate the unstable 
factors. That is, we must never on any account ignore the 
unstable factors. The governments at various levels should 
further strengthen the understanding about the importance of 
safeguarding social stability, pay high attention to and support 
the security work, and try every possible means to ensure the 
allocation of the funds for the security work. We should 
strengthen the construction of the security workers contingents 
and cultivate a rank of security workers who have good ideas and 
work style, be faithful to the party and the people, and [words 
indistinct]; whom the party and the government trust and the 
people love; and who have combat effectiveness so as to ensure 
that the construction of the spiritual and material 
civilizations will continuously rank the province among the best 
in the whole country. 
  Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, chaired the conference.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest economic center, expects 1994 to be another year of 
"rapid and healthy economic development," officials said. 
  Shanghai will have an increase of 12 percent in its gross 
domestic product (GDP) this year, lower than 1992 and 1993 but 
higher than the national average and, according to Hua Jianmin, 
director of the Municipal Planning Commission. The city's 
average annual growth rate in the 1980s was 7.4 percent. 
  The industrial sector, which accounts for some 60 percent of 
the municipality's GDP, will try for a growth rate of 15 
percent, Xu Zhiyi, director of the Municipal Economic Commission 
said. 
  He said that the industrial sector would emphasize the 
development of automobiles, telecommunications, power stations, 
computers and household electric appliances. Some 18 projects 
with an investment of more than 200 million yuan or an output 
value of more than one billion yuan each were designated as key 
projects. 
  The growth rate in foreign trade is expected to surpass last 
year's 12 percent. Sha Ling, vice-mayor in charge of foreign 
trade, said that foreign trade should become the impetus of the 
economic restructuring and the sustained, healthy and rapid 
development of the economy of Shanghai. 
  In 1994, Shanghai will invest more than 20 billion yuan in 
the service industries, more than the total for the primary and 
secondary industries. The service industries are expected to 
yield 40 percent of Shanghai's GDP. 
  Pudong New Area, one of the largest development areas in 
China, is expected to produce more than 25 billion yuan of GDP 
this year, an increase of 30 percent over last year, according 
to Zhao Qizheng, head of the Area Management Commission. 
  The area will also produce 1.25 billion U.S. dollars worth 
of 
exports, an increase of 25 percent over last year. Both targets 
are double those of the municipality's average. 
  In addition, the commodity retail sales volume will surpass 
83 billion yuan, an increase of more than 27 percent. 
  Some economists are worried that bottle-neck problems, 
mainly 
in capital and raw materials, might hamper the economic 
development of Shanghai to some extent. 
  But the listed targets will be realized if there are no 
major 
changes in the macro economic environment, most economists said.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 16 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai 
financial sector has been pouring nearly half a billion yuan and 
10 million U.S. dollars to boost the construction of four major 
projects in the Pudong new zone. 
  Construction of the four key projects for the Pudong's 
industry and commerce, with a total investment of over one 
billion yuan, has already started. 
  Of the large sum, 115 million yuan and 10.2 million U.S. 
dollars loaned to a Sino-Japanese joint venture with an annual 
production of 400,000 rotatory air-conditioner compressors came 
from the Pudong branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of 
China. 
  Another 50 million yuan loans for rebuilding a new and 
high-tech project of textile processing were provided by the 
Shanghai branch of the Bank of Communications. 
  When completed, the project is expected to add to a new 
profit of nearly 100 million yuan.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 15 (CNS) -- Deputy Secretary of 
the Shanghai municipal party committee, Mr. Chen Liangyu, who is 
in charge of organizational and personnel affairs, recently 
revealed that the municipality had now set its goals for 
personnel training beyond the end of this century. 
  According to Mr. Chen, this personnel-training project 
includes 100 high-level party and government leaders, 800 to 
1,000 high-level management personnel and a large batch of 
internationally well-known experts of various kinds. 
  The deputy secretary held that the key to realizing this 
goal 
was the further freeing of people's thinking, the converting of 
their ideas and the selection and promotion of cadres in a bold 
way. The city authorities will create the conditions for these 
people to bring their talents into full play and for them to 
gain experience in various posts at both higher and lower levels.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 14 (XINHUA) -- A feasibility 
study on opening a deep waterway at the mouth of the Chang Jiang 
River, China's longest, has been completed, according to experts 
attending an assessment seminar held by the Ministry of 
Communications. 
  The experts agree that the present 7-meter-deep waterway at 
the river mouth has greatly restricted the economic growth of 
Shanghai, the Chang Jiang River delta and the Chang Jiang River 
Valley. Therefore, an upgrading project has become an imminent 
task. 
  According to the study, a 12.5-meter-deep waterway will be 
developed. In six years, 50,000-ton vessels will be able to go 
freely into and out of the Chang Jiang River, whereas at 
present, the river mouth is accessible only to 20,000-ton 
vessels. 
  The upgrading program will help Shanghai play a pivotal role 
in international container transport and on the other hand 
promote the economic growth of Shanghai and the whole Chang 
Jiang River Delta, experts say. 
  The study was conducted chiefly by the Shanghai Waterway 
Bureau and the Nanjing Hydraulic Design Institute.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 14 (XINHUA) -- In east China's 
Zhejiang Province 37 new cities and 189 towns have emerged 
during the past five years, with as many as counties and 
villages disappearing. 
  So far, there are 29 cities and 889 towns in the province's 
100,000 sq km landspace, concentrated in the southern and 
northern sectors. 
  For example, Wenling County has set up 21 towns, ranking 
first in the province. These towns, taking advantage of 
neighboring on Wenzhou, which was a pioneer in introducing the 
market economy, have shifted into the specialized ones involving 
the industries of clothing and household electric appliance. 
  It is also reported that the province has injected an 
average 
of 10 billion yuan annually to improve the infrastructure of 
these towns. 
  Experts attribute the increase in the number of cities and 
towns to the brisk growth of township enterprises there. 
  So far, six million farmers have flocked to find employment 
in over 500,000 township enterprises. 
  For example, in Shangyu city, a former county town, the 
output value from township enterprises accounts for four-fifths 
of the industrial output total, far surpassing that of 
agriculture. And as a result, it was promoted to a city in 1992. 
  Meanwhile, the province boasts more than 4,300 flourishing 
commodities markets, which are briskly promoting the industries 
of finance, communications and services. 
  Among them, Yiwu is the most outstanding. A poor county ten 
years ago, it has poured hundreds of millions of yuan into 
infrastructure projects, like an airport, railway station and 
power facility, greatly upgrading the investment environment.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Eastern Zhejiang 
province has made great progress in reforming the management 
system of state-owned enterprises, according to the provincial 
commission for restructuring the economic system. 
  To date, some 1,300 of the 5,000-plus state-owned 
enterprises 
in the province have been incorporated into limited liability 
company or joint stock companies. 
  Over the past year, the number of enterprises which adopted 
the corporate system has been increasing rapidly. By the end of 
last year, the province had approved 126 enterprises to become 
joint stock companies which met the prescribed standards, with a 
registered capital of more than 8.1 billion yuan. Of the 
enterprises, six have been listed on the stock exchanges in 
Shanghai and Shenzhen and another five will be listed soon. Two 
of them have floated stocks, which will be listed in Shanghai 
and Shenzhen. 
  At present, there are 1,064 limited liability companies in 
the province, 40 of which were converted from former state-owned 
enterprises. 
  In addition, 262 state-owned enterprises have been merged, 
310 auctioned and 11 declared bankrupt over the past few years. 
  The aim of defining the property rights is to enable 
enterprises to meet the requirements of the modern enterprise 
system instead of to privatize them, an official of the system 
restructuring commission said. 
  He said that township enterprises, which produce 60 percent 
of the province's total output, will try the joint stock 
companies this year.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Most economic 
indexes of Zhejiang Province, one of the most developed areas of 
China, were ten percentage points higher in 1993 than the 
nation's average, according to provincial Governor Wan Xueyuan. 
  Addressing a provincial economic conference which opened 
here 
Tuesday [11 January], Wan said that Zhejiang's gross domestic 
product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- is 
expected to total 164.5 billion yuan last year, up 25 percent 
over 1992. 
  He also released other figures illustrating Zhejiang's 
impressive economic growth in 1993: industrial output value is 
projected to shoot up 52.5 percent to 392.8 billion yuan; retail 
sales are expected to climb 33 percent to 75.9 billion yuan; 
exports are projected to jump nearly 20 percent to 4.44 billion 
U.S. dollars; and revenue is expected to soar almost 39 percent 
to 16.6 billion yuan. 
  The governor said that the GDP of Zhejiang, with a 
population 
of 43 million, has risen at an annual rate of 12 percent since 
1980. 
  Local officials and economists attending the conference 
agreed that Zhejiang's rapid economic growth stems primarily 
from the expanding a market economy in line with specific 
conditions in the province. 
  Conference delegates will discuss measures to step up the 
reforms and accelerate economic growth in the new year, with 
emphasis on enhancing the consciousness of opening up and 
expanding an open economy. 
  Governor Wan said higher consciousness of opening to the 
outside world makes it imperative to break away from what he 
called the idea of a "small-scale peasant economy," and to 
effect fundamental changes in the way of thinking and work 
styles. 
  According to Wan, the BOT (build, operate and transfer) 
method -- which means that a facility is built and operated by 
an overseas company before transferring it to Chinese 
authorities after a given period -- should be adopted in using 
foreign funds to undertake major infrastructure construction 
projects.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Agricultural 
income in Guangdong Province, south China, edged slightly higher 
in 1993 over the previous year despite serious adverse natural 
elements. 
  Statistics from the provincial government show that last 
year 
the province's agricultural output totaled 68.3 billion yuan 
(about 7.85 billion U.S. dollars), up by three percent over the 
previous year. 
  Farmers' per capita income hit 1,600 yuan, up by ten percent 
in real terms. 
  Last year, the province was hit by successive natural 
adversities such as cold waves, hail, storms and typhoons, with 
direct losses totaling 12.2 billion yuan. 
  Government officials attribute the increase to the 
dissemination of improved grain varieties and cash crops, and a 
better development of livestock and some poultry. 
  In addition, the province has been putting great emphasis on 
fostering agricultural bases for the production of fine grains, 
vegetables and fruits.

  [Text] The enlarged Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth 
Henan Provincial CPC Committee was convened in Zhengzhou between 
24 and 27 December, 1993. It was attended by 46 provincial 
party committee members and eight alternate members. Some 160 
comrades in charge of the provincial departments concerned also 
attended the enlarged plenary session as nonvoting delegates. 
  Provincial party committee leaders, including, [provincial 
Secretary] Li Changchun; [provincial Governor] Ma Zhongchen; Ren 
Keli; Song Zhaosu; [provincial military district Political 
commissar] Wu Guangxian; Zheng Zengmao; Zhang Dexian; Fan 
Qinchen; and Zhang Wenbin, attended the enlarged plenary session. 
  The comrades attending the enlarged plenary session 
conscientiously studied The CPC Central Committee Decision on 
Several Questions on Building a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure, which was adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, as well as an important speech by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin, and vowed to implement the spirit of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
quicken the pace of Henan's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. 
  The enlarged plenary session also deliberated on and adopted 
The Henan Provincial CPC Committee Opinions on Implementing The 
CPC Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building 
a Socialist Market Economic Structure. 
  Comrade Li Changchun delivered a work report entitled: 
Conscientiously Implement the Spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Open Up New Vistas 
for Reform, Opening up, and Modernization Building in which he 
summed up Henan's work in 1993 and mapped out comprehensive 
arrangements for 1994. 
  The enlarged plenary session stated: The Henan Provincial 
CPC Committee Opinions on Implementing The CPC Central Committee 
Decision on Several Questions on Building a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure has conscientiously implemented the spirit of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; 
adhered to the party's basic line; mapped out a guiding ideology 
and a basic principle for expeditiously building a socialist 
market economic structure and pushing ahead with economic 
development and social progress in Henan; and laid down a series 
of important principles and measures, thereby being an important 
document guiding Henan's economic structural reform. 
Conscientiously implementing and carrying out the CPC Central 
Committee decision, as well as the Henan Provincial CPC 
Committee opinions, is of crucial significance to promoting 
Henan's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization cause. 
  The enlarged plenary session fully affirmed the Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee Work Report, saying: In 1993, Henan 
has comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, as well as the spirit of a series of 
important speeches made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his 
south China tour, and made marked achievements in respect of 
reform, opening up, and modernization building. The Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee has now mapped out a clear-cut guiding 
ideology for Henan's work in 1994. The goals and tasks laid down 
by the Henan Provincial CPC Committee for the year 1994 fully 
tally with the realities in Henan. Moreover, the Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee has also worked out practicable 
concrete measures to this end. Thus, party committees and 
governments at all levels in Henan should now strive to carry 
them out. 
  The enlarged plenary session pointed out: At present, Henan, 
being at a crucial juncture of reform, opening up, and 
modernization building, is shouldering the historical mission of 
building a socialist market economic structure and attaining the 
second-stage strategic goal set for Henan's national economic 
and social development. In order to attain such a goal as 
building a socialist market economic structure, it is imperative 
to adhere to the principle of keeping the public ownership 
system as the mainstay and allowing other economic factors to 
evolve at the same time; continually shift operative mechanisms 
of state-owned enterprises; establish a modern enterprise system 
commensurate with a market economy; build an open market system 
by energetically building an essential production elements 
market; further institutional reform; transform government 
functions; establish a provincial-level economic regulation and 
control system known for strong indirect regulation and control 
measures; establish and perfect an income distribution system in 
accordance with the principle of distribution according to work 
and with the emphasis on work efficiency and fairness; and 
establish and perfect a multilevel social security system 
catering to the needs of both the old and the unemployed. At 
present, in order to comprehensively further reform and make 
major breakthroughs in all fields, it is necessary to devote 
more energies to establishing a modern enterprise system, a 
market system, and a social security system; transforming 
government functions; placing rural economic growth within the 
orbit of a market economy; as well as to other key reforms. We 
must make specific work arrangements; adopt feasible measures; 
and strive to achieve tangible results in all fields. Moreover, 
it is necessary to seize each and every excellent opportunity to 
vigorously expand opening up to the outside world and raise 
opening up to a higher level, larger scope, and in an in-depth 
manner. 
  The enlarged plenary session noted: Building a socialist 
market economic structure is definitely an onerous, grand, and 
lofty undertaking. Thus, party committees and governments at 
all levels should make overall arrangements and carry out work 
in accordance with the party's basic theory and basic line; 
concentrate more efforts on in-depth reforms; judge reforms 
outcome using the three beneficials criterion; make constant 
efforts to emancipate the mind; seek truth from facts; boldly 
draw upon experiences of all countries in the world, including 
developed capitalist countries, in respect of conducting 
socialized big production in accordance with the law of market; 
resist old traditions and outdated concepts which have proved 
not to conform with a market economy; heighten vigilance against 
both the right and left deviations, but mainly the left; be 
brave in exploring new ways, trying out new measures, and 
implementing new systems; strive to maintain social stability; 
make reform, opening up, economic growth, and social stability 
promote and unify one another; respect the pioneering spirit of 
the masses and show concern for their immediate interests; guide 
the broad masses of the people to correctly view the reform and 
actively support it; bring into full play creativity among the 
masses; and strive to turn reform measures into actual actions 
on the part of the broad masses of the people. 
  The enlarged plenary session held: Party committees at all 
levels in Henan should earnestly strengthen leadership and 
coordinate with one another in all fields. The departments 
concerned at all levels in Henan should also take the overall 
situation into account and cooperate with one another in an 
unreserved manner with a view to securing a smooth reform 
process. Successfully carrying out work in 1994 is of great 
significance to grasping the excellent opportunities, 
accelerating reform and development, and attaining Henan's 
second-stage strategic goal by the end of the 1990's. As we are 
confronted with hopes, difficulties, opportunities, and 
challenges at the moment, we should develop a strong sense of 
historical responsibility and a strong sense of epochal urgency; 
firmly bear in mind that poverty is not socialism and 
development is the last word [fazhan cai shi ying daoli 4099 
1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810]; adhere to the guiding ideology 
of grasping the excellent opportunities to speed up development; 
continually adhere to the new train of thought of promoting 
development by virtue of in-depth reforms and expanded opening 
up; continually adhere to the ideological line of emancipating 
the mind and seeking truth from facts; focus on ideological 
transformation, this being a key link; judge reform's outcome 
using the three beneficials criterion; comprehensively promote 
socialist modernization building; unswervingly uphold the 
principle of firmly and simultaneously grasping two key work 
aspects; place all types of work under the guidance of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
well as the party's basic line; take the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision as a program of 
action; strive to attain the strategic goal of raising Henan's 
GNP to a level higher than the country's average and lowering 
Henan's population growth rate to a level lower than the 
country's average; continually grasp the excellent 
opportunities, deepen reform, expand opening up, and accelerate 
development; take a real step forward in building a socialist 
market economic structure; and strive to achieve phenomenal 
success in accelerating technological transformation, improving 
economic efficiency, and optimizing economic structure to step 
up party building and spiritual civilization, deepen the ongoing 
anticorruption struggle, consolidate social and political 
stability, and bring about a faster and healthier national 
economic growth in Henan. 
  The enlarged plenary session stressed: In order to build a 
socialist market economic structure and expedite modernization 
building, it is necessary to step up party building and improve 
party leadership. Improved competence on the part of party 
organizations at all levels in Henan in respect of guiding 
economic work and overall reform is the key to accomplishing the 
historical tasks of reform and development. Therefore, it is 
necessary to improve the overall quality of the broad masses of 
party members and cadres; arm the broad masses of party members 
and cadres across Henan with the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; gear their thinking and efforts to 
developing a socialist market economy; enhance their resolution 
and consciousness in implementing and carrying out the party's 
basic line and developing a socialist market economy; adapt them 
to the new situation of reform and development; boldly select 
and promote, in accordance with the principle of laying stress 
on both moral integrity and professional competence as well as 
the principle of cadres' four transformations, to leading posts 
cadres who have proven to be dedicated to the party's cause, 
adhered to the line of reform and opening up, and scored 
noticeable achievements in work; build party organizations at 
all levels into staunch leading nuclei and strongholds; improve 
work style; go deep among the masses and carry out 
investigations and study in the forefront of reform and opening 
up; boldly carry out explorations; work in a down-to-earth 
manner; and creatively fulfill all reform and construction tasks. 
  The enlarged plenary session urged the broad masses of party 
members, cadres, and people in Henan to rally more closely round 
the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core; 
vigorously press ahead with reform; work hard; carry out 
pioneering work; go all out to build a prosperous Henan; 
energetically build a socialist market economic structure; bring 
about a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic growth; 
and promote overall social progress in Henan as well.

  [Text] The provincial government yesterday morning held a 
news conference to release information about infrastructure 
construction of the province in 1993. Last year, the province 
conscientiously implemented the guideline laid down by the 
central authorities on intensifying macroeconomic regulation and 
control. All the projects under construction were sorted out 
and rearranged in order of priority, and resources and funds 
were pooled together to support selected key projects. 
  In 1993, all the fixed asset investment projects completed 
by 
enterprises in the province involved a total value of 25.3 
billion yuan, an increase of 33.8 percent over the previous 
year. Of this investment value, capital construction 
investments shared 13.5 billion yuan, an increase of 36.6 
percent; and technological transformation and equipment updating 
projects shared 8 billion yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent. It 
is expected that the investment value of completed local-run 
investment projects will have reached 15.6 billion yuan by 
year's end, accounting for 61.8 percent of the total investment 
value. 
  As far as the power industry is concerned, the year 1993 
witnessed the province's largest ever scale of projects under 
construction and the highest ever amount of investment funds 
involved. The value of completed investments in the power 
industry totaled 1.56 billion yuan, total installed power 
generating capacity increased by 505,000 kilowatt-hours, thus 
raising the province's total installed power generating capacity 
to 8,135,000 kilowatt- hours and ranking the province seventh in 
the country. 
  The province also made great progress in expanding its 
communication facilities. By the end of last year, the 
province's total length of highways open to traffic amounted to 
45,000 km, and the per-unit-area distribution of highways was 
26.48 km per square km, ranking the province eighth among other 
provinces in the country. The province's total length of local 
railroads open to traffic was 1,710 km, ranking the province 
first in the country. Smooth progress has been made in the 
construction of the Zhengzhou- Kaifeng-Luoyang expressway 
project, the leading one of the province's 10 key projects 
designated by the provincial government as part of its plan to 
expedite the process of reform and opening up. A section of 
this highway--the northern part of the Kaifeng- Zhengzhou 
section--has been completed and is about to be officially opened 
to traffic. Meanwhile, 79.2 percent of the earthwork to build 
the roadbed of the Zhengzhou-Xinzheng expressway has been 
completed. The Huang He bridge at Sanmenxia which links Henan 
and Shanxi provinces was already opened to traffic by the end of 
last year. 
  The province also made breakthroughs in water conservancy 
capital construction. With regard to the two major projects to 
divert the water of the Huang He to Yuzhai in Xinshan and to 
Dafeng, more than 20 million cubic meters of earth digging work 
was completed last year as part of the main canal construction, 
and 85 related sub- projects were completed. Now the basic 
requirements have been fulfilled to enable the two projects to 
be put into primary operation by the end of the 1990's. The 
Huai He harnessing project has been progressing smoothly; by the 
end of last year 20 related projects had been launched, and the 
annual investment plans for all these projects were completed. 
  In 1993, the province made major progress in the development 
of postal and telecommunication services. A total of 447,000 
local telephone lines and 10,490 long-distance direct-dial 
telephone lines were newly installed. Meanwhile, the 
Beijing-Zhengzhou-Guangzhou optical fiber cable laying project 
has been completed and put into operation, 2,000 km of local 
second-class trunk-line optical fiber cable has been laid, and 
266 km of microwave telecommunication line has been put into 
use. Telephone service at and above the prefectural and city 
level in this province is now operated on a program controlled 
basis. Cities above the county level now enjoy automatically 
connecting telephone service, and the central town of most 
counties enjoys long-distance direct-dialing telephone service. 
In addition, mobile phone and telephone paging services have 
been developing very rapidly. And a high-tech modern postal and 
telecommunication service network with a large capacity is in 
the making in the province.

  [Text] Bai Meiqing, vice minister of the Ministry of 
Internal Trade and concurrently director of the State Grain 
Reserve Administration, came to Changsha City on 9 January to 
inspect how the city controlled grain and oil prices. 
  Accompanied by Vice Governor Zhou Shichang as well as 
provincial and Changsha City grain bureau leaders, Vice Minister 
Bai Meiqing went to grain shops in Wuyi Zhonglu, Renminlu, and 
Taipingjie, where he carefully checked the price tags as well as 
the grain and oil quality and asked about grain and oil sales. 
  To implement instructions of the State Council, 400.5 
million 
kg of grain has been dumped onto the markets throughout the 
province to control grain prices. Grain departments have been 
active in transporting grain and in ensuring variety, quality, 
quantity, prices, and service. Since the period before the New 
Year, all grain departments have openly sold their grain with 
price tags, thus speedily reducing grain and oil prices 
throughout the province.

  [Text] Through several years of efforts, Hunan has made 
major headway in family planning, and a marked change has taken 
place in four aspects. 
  First, the masses' concept about birth has changed and their 
concept about family planning has improved. In particular, 
because the masses have attained a better understanding of the 
reform and opening up policy, and few and optimal births as well 
as late marriage have become a habit among young people in some 
localities. According to statistics from the provincial 
statistical bureau, married couples of child-bearing age who 
only wish to have one or two children for the rest of their life 
account for 77 percent. In 1992 the one-child rate was 67.9 
percent of the children born in that year. 
  Second, the province's excessive population growth has been 
effectively controlled. In 1992 it was reduced by nine per 
thousand compared with 1987, the family planning rate increased 
by 21.7 percent, and the multiple-birth rate dropped by 
approximately 13.3 percent. The two children and multiple-birth 
rates have been basically changed. 
  Third, family planning work standards have improved. Most 
localities in the province pay attention to family planning. 
  Fourth, the province's population growth rate is approaching 
the country's advanced level. In 1992 the province's family 
planning ranked in the forefront of two digit localities in the 
country's provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. 
According to an estimate, in 1993 the province could fulfill 
the state's population control program.

  [Text] Changsha, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The Zhuzhou 
smeltery in central China's Hunan Province exported 62 million 
U.S. dollars worth of lead and zinc in 1993, more than any other 
smeltery in China. 
  A smeltery official said that the Zhuzhou-based factory is 
the only Chinese enterprise listed in the London Metal Exchange 
for the trading of lead and zinc. 
  The smeltery is preparing to launch a multinational company 
in an effort to broaden its market in other countries. 
  The smeltery's production of copper, lead and zinc has risen 
at an annual rate of 10,000 tons since 1991, topping 200,000 
tons for the first time in 1993, he said. 
  Also since 1991, the smeltery has scored an annual increase 
of 15 percent in earnings from sales and an annual rise of 20 
percent in profits and taxes. 
  In 1993 the smeltery earned 1.25 billion yuan (about 14.4 
million U.S. dollars) from sales, and generated 170 million yuan 
in profits and taxes, the official said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Looking Forward To a Good Beginning in </F>
Cross-Strait Relations This Year"] 
  [Text] The Third Session of the First Council of the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] of 
the Chinese mainland concluded in Beijing last Thursday. The 
session was called at the beginning of the year and was a good 
opportunity to summarize cross-strait nongovernment exchanges, 
as well as to review prospects for cross-strait relations. 
  The year 1993 was one in which great developments were made 
in cross-strait relations. Cross-strait nongovernment exchanges 
expanded, there was an unprecedented amount of Taiwanese 
investment in the mainland both in scope and type, and 
cross-strait bilateral trade continued to grow drastically. The 
cross-strait high-ranking nongovernment "Wang-Ku talks" were 
held for the first time, and ARATS-SEF [Straits Exchange 
Foundation] routine talks were held in Taipei for the first time. 
  The mainland authorities issued a White Paper on "The Taiwan 
Issue and China's Reunification" in 1993, which states to the 
world the Chinese mainland's position, principle, and policies 
on the Taiwan issue in a comprehensive and systematic way so 
that the world may have a clearer picture of the issue. 
  The rapid development in cross-strait relations has internal 
impetus, namely China's reform and opening up, the elevation of 
its position in the world, and the cultural tradition and 
flesh-and- blood ties shared by people on the two shores. In 
modern history, Taiwan was ceded to Japan for over half a 
century, and has been separated from the Chinese mainland since 
1949. Since the beginning of the 1980's the economic 
development and ties between the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong 
have become increasingly closer. Thus a new opportunity for the 
reinvigoration of the Chinese nation has surfaced. 
  Before Chiang Ching-kuo passed away, he lifted the ban on 
Taiwan people going to the Chinese mainland to visit relatives. 
That was a practical measure with great vision, and has played 
a great role in promoting the relaxation and gradual development 
of cross-strait relations characterized by long-termed 
confrontation. Changes have gradually taken place in Taiwan's 
situation with the end of the Chiang era. The Kuomintang 
second-generation leaders who are now in office are 
characterized by fewer ties with the mainland, but with weaker 
anticommunist sentiments. On the one hand, they have handled 
cross-strait relations with a comparatively practical attitude, 
and gradually relaxed restrictions on Taiwan businessmen 
investing in the mainland. On the other hand, however, they 
have the consciousness of being content to retain sovereignty 
over a part of the country, and always want to give prominence 
to a "political body on an equal footing" in cross-strait 
exchanges, while doing their best to embody "one China, one 
Taiwan" in ties with foreign countries. The surfacing of the 
monster "vacationing foreign affairs" [du jia wai jiao 3256 0250 
1120 0094] is one example. 
  It is precisely such an erroneous mentality of being content 
to retain sovereignty over a part of China that has resulted in 
unfavorable effects on cross-strait relations today. The 
repatriation of hijackers from mainland China should never have 
been difficult to achieve, and could have been entirely resolved 
through full negotiations between ARATS and SEF in the spirit of 
the Jinmen Accord. But the Taiwan Authorities decisionmaking 
tier is bent on giving prominence to the political and legal 
nature of this routine issue, thus making the issue exceed the 
nongovernment scope of ARATS and SEF. Consequently, the matter 
remains unsolved. It is universally known where the crux of the 
problem lies. 
  While dealing with cross-strait political issue, ARATS 
Chairman Mr. Wang Daohan said that this issue called for both 
mainland and Taiwan Authorities to send negotiators. That was a 
sensible and reasonable attitude. Because both ARATS and SEF 
are nongovernment organizations authorized by relevant Taiwan 
and mainland authorities, and were founded to resolve specific 
issues in cross- strait ties, the ARATS-SEF routine and 
functional talks should be free of political intervention. 
However, will Taipei be courageous enough to send men to 
conduct talks with the mainland on political issues? 
  The cross-strait economic and cultural exchange will 
continue 
to expand, the talks between ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei and 
his SEF counterpart Mr. Chiao Jen-ho may make arrangements for 
the second Wang-Ku meeting, which is the hope and interest of 
compatriots in both Taiwan and mainland China. Taipei suddenly 
spread the news yesterday that the Tang-Chiao talks would be 
postponed. That is not a rational and practical attitude. We 
hope that Taipei's decisionmakers will be good to their word and 
let the Tang-Chiao talks be conducted as scheduled so that 
cross-strait relations may enjoy a good beginning this year.

<F P=106> ["Year-ender roundup" by XINHUA reporter Liu Shizhong (0491 </F>
0670 1813): "Review of Taiwan Economic Conditions in 1993 Shows 
There Has Been Progress as Well as Hidden Worries"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- Under an overall 
international economic recession in 1993, Taiwan's economy 
experienced an uneasy year: Taiwan repeatedly lowered its 
economic growth targets, and the willingness to invest within 
the island continued to remain low. Meanwhile, rapid increases 
in cross-Strait economic exchanges have considerably enhanced 
Taiwan's economic progress. Consequently, while maintaining a 
medium-growth rate, Taiwan has been moving toward economic 
recovery. 
  According to an estimation by Taiwan's "Economics Ministry," 
with a total output value of more than $10,000 per capita, 
Taiwan's economic growth rate in 1993 was 6.08 percent, which 
fell short of its original growth target of 7.00 percent. Due 
to a recession in western countries in the first half of 1993, 
there was almost no increase in Taiwan's industrial production, 
exports, and export orders. The balance of Taiwan's foreign 
exchange accounts, its currency supply, its stock price indices, 
and the exchange rates for the New Taiwan dollar have dropped 
considerably. In the second half of 1993, after the Taiwan 
authorities drastically curtailed its Six- Year Economic 
Construction Plan and formulated the Economic Invigoration 
Program, and with various internal and external factors exerting 
a comprehensive impact on the island, Taiwan's economic 
conditions have improved somewhat. 
  Over the past year Taiwan's foreign trade gradually slowed 
as 
its principal economic component. Its exports to Europe and the 
United States have decreased. Its trade deficit with Japan have 
continued to worsen, with expected trade deficits with Japan for 
the entire year totalling over $13 billion. According to 
statistics, as of 20 November Taiwan's total imports and exports 
were $68.7 billion and $57.6 billion respectively, registering 
corresponding growth rates of 8.3 percent and 4.2 percent. Its 
foreign trade surplus was $940 million [figures as printed], 
down $2.23 billion over the same period in 1992. 
  That Taiwan was able to maintain a medium economic growth 
rate of about 6 percent has an inseparable connection with the 
rapid increase in cross-Strait economic exchanges. According to 
Taiwan's statistics, cross-Strait transshipping trade from 
January to September 1993 totalled $6.39 billion, and the value 
for the entire year is expected to surpass $9 billion. 
According to statistics, after the value on cross-Strait trade 
with the PRC was deducted, Taiwan's foreign trade grew only 0.7 
percent in 1993. Additionally, as a result of economic progress 
in the PRC, Taiwanese businessmen have rapidly increased their 
investments on the mainland. According to a survey by the 
Zhonghua [Chung-hua] Institute for Economic Research, for every 
U.S. dollar invested by Taiwanese businessmen in the PRC, Taiwan 
will be able to increase its exports by $2. Taiwan's "Economic 
Affairs Minister" Jiang Bingkun [Chiang Ping- kun] admitted: 
The development of cross-Strait economic relations and trade 
has become the driving force for Taiwan's economic progress. 
  Furthermore, economic transformation has gradually spread. 
Following the expansion of island-wide demand in recent years, 
Taiwan has accelerated its industrial restructuring. On the one 
hand, contributions by the services industry to the total output 
value will further increase; they are expected to reach 56 
percent, higher than that of the manufacturing industry. On the 
other hand, the number of labor-intensive industries has further 
declined, whereas the number of capital and technology-intensive 
industries has risen steadily. Small enterprises have been 
developing into large ones. Large enterprises and giant 
financial groups have been playing more and more important roles 
during Taiwan's economic progress. Following changes in 
industrial organizations, the markets of many manufacturing 
industries -- including vehicle, engines, computer software and 
hardware devices, and the paper making industry -- have 
gradually fallen under the control of a small number of giant 
firms. According to a survey, 300 large enterprise groups 
control some 20 percent of Taiwan's nongovernmental economic 
resources, a quarter of which are in the hands of five family 
groups including Wang Yongqing, Gu Zhenfu, Cai Wanlin, Wu 
Dongjin, and Xu Youxiang. The annual transactional value of the 
five family groups amounts to 6,000 billion Taiwan dollars, or 
more than 10 percent of Taiwan's annual total output. 
  Though Taiwan has begun to transform its economy from 
catering to exports to fulfilling internal demand, the 
willingness to invest within the island is still low. The 
investment environment has not improved because of the 
following: old production systems have not been withdrawn; new 
production systems have not been established; and problems 
include difficulties in obtaining land, increases in labor 
wages, higher environmental protection requirements, and adverse 
impacts from political factors. Small and medium enterprises 
have continued to move out. Taiwan lacks a powerful internal 
force to enhance economic progress. The "Economic Invigoration 
Program" aimed at spurring the nongovernmental sector's 
enthusiasm to invest has failed to obtain its expected target. 
The number of newly-registered companies has been declining 
every month since May 1993. 
  There are hidden worries about whether Taiwan can still 
achieve economic progress in 1994. Factors which will propel 
Taiwan's economy to recover to some extent include official 
efforts towards "economic invigoration," the launching of large 
investment projects already formulated by some giant financial 
groups, and the ongoing rapid development in cross-Strait 
economic relations and trade exchanges; but the economy will not 
develop rapidly. Restraining factors which will hinder Taiwan's 
economic progress are the restricting international economic 
recession and the Taiwanese authorities' financial difficulties 
in 1994, due to which the rate of increase in public investment 
within the island will decline; private consumption, after 
rising for several consecutive years, may also decline in 1994.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Eastern Jiangsu 
Province approved more than 1,800 Taiwan-funded enterprises in 
1993, involving two billion U.S. dollars in contracted Taiwan 
investment. 
  To date, 3,400 Taiwan-funded enterprises, involving 1.48 
billion U.S. dollars in Taiwan funds, have been established in 
the province, which registers the largest gross domestic product 
in China. 
  Of the enterprises, projects related to high technology and 
basic industry have been increasing rapidly. Real estate, 
retail sales, the entertainment industry and services industry 
have also become investment focuses of investors from Taiwan. 
  There are now more than 100 Taiwan-funded enterprises each 
with an investment of more than 10 million U.S. dollars in 
Jiangsu. 
  Development zones for Taiwan investors have been set aside 
in 
Nanjing, the capital of the province, Suzhou, Nantong and 
Lianyungang. 
  The unique geographical situation, well-balanced industrial 
framework and continuously improving investment environment 
attracted them, many Taiwan businessmen said. 
  The province expects more financial groups and major 
enterprises this year and hopes to cooperate with them 
particularly in construction of basic industries and 
infrastructures, including iron and steel plants, power plants 
and road and port construction, local officials said.

  [Text] Xiamen, January 13 (XINHUA) -- A boom of contacts in 
posts and telecommunications between Fujian Province's Xiamen 
and Taiwan has brought the two places closer in people-to-people 
exchanges. 
  Telephone calls to Taiwan jumped from some 80,000 per month 
early last year to more than 120,000 by the year-end. 
Altogether, 1.305 million calls to Taiwan were made in 1993, up 
41 percent over the 1992 figure, according to Li Zhenqun, 
director of the Xiamen Posts and Telecommunications Bureau. 
  He said 1.18 million articles of mail were shipped to Taiwan 
last year, an increase of 37.8 percent compared with 1992. It 
takes only three days for mail to reach the other side, he added. 
  Xiamen was the first mainland city to open posts and 
telecommunications contacts with Taiwan, in 1984. 
  The official attributed the increase in communication to the 
booming business being done by Taiwan businessmen with the 
Chinese mainland and the growing numbers of visits by Taiwanese 
to their ancestral homes on the mainland. 
  He also gave credit to the fact that more and more people in 
Xiamen are acquiring telephones at home, which makes calls 
easier.

  [Text] A delegation representing the mainland Chinese press 
met with ROC [Republic of China] senior statesman Ku Chen-fu 
yesterday and invited him to visit the mainland. 
  Ku reportedly said the ROC was "flexible" in allowing such a 
visit, but did not formally accept. 
  The presence of the delegation, on a 10 day visit to the 
island, was made possible by an understanding brokered by Ku and 
his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan during their breakthrough 
talks in Singapore last April. 
  A reciprocal visit to the mainland by members of the Taiwan 
media is scheduled for March. 
  The delegation yesterday met with heads of the semi-official 
Central News Agency yesterday in an exchange of impressions on 
the differences between mainland news organizations and those in 
Taiwan. They expressed surprise at the large number of 
publications and news agencies operating here and were 
particularly interested in the financial situation of the 
independent press. 
  The delegation is led by Nan Zhenjong, vice-president of the 
Xinhua news bureau in Beijing and, one of the first high ranking 
members of the Chinese Communist Party to visit here.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 17 (CNA) -- Scientists from Taiwan and 
Mainland China met at a seminar on technology and industrial 
goods which opened Monday [17 January] at the Taipei 
International Convention Center. 
  Lin Chuei-chou, president of the Industrial Technology 
Research Institute (ITRI), said at the opening ceremony that 
scholars and experts from both sides of the Taiwan Strait could 
use the meeting as a basis for more contacts and exchanges. 
  The two-day seminar is sponsored by the ITRI, China Steel 
Corp. and COMMERCIAL TIMES newspaper and will focus on steel, 
materials and intellectual property rights. 
  A 24-member mainland delegation, headed by Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, arrived in Taiwan 
Sunday to participate in the seminar. 
  Besides members of the academy, the delegation also included 
officials of leading steel companies in the mainland. 
  Zhou said upon his arrival that he hoped cross-strait 
sci-tech exchanges would cover not just basic, applied and 
industrial science, but nuclear science as well. 
  The head of the mainland's highest research institute also 
said he was happy to see cross-strait exchanges have increased 
in the past few years. 
  Zhou revealed that 10 Taiwan scientists will board a 
mainland 
research ship in April to conduct research in the South China 
Sea. 
  He also noted that Taiwan has more experience with nuclear- 
generated electricity, and he believed the mainland could learn 
from the experience. 
  During their stay in Taiwan, Zhou's group will also visit 
academic facilities in Taiwan.

<F P=106> [By station reporter Huang Mei-ping; from the "Hookup" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Huang Yen-chao, director of the International Trade 
Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will leave for 
the United States on 17 January as the head a delegation to take 
part in the talks between the Republic of China [ROC] and the 
United States on variable tariff reductions [on U.S. exports to 
Taiwan]. 
  Before his departure, Director Huang said: According to 
information from ROC units abroad, some U.S. congressmen are 
doing everything they can to reinstate the Super 301 provision. 
While Japan is the main target, the time is not favorable for 
our side for the negotiations because this is the time when the 
U.S. Congress and U.S. manufacturers are exerting pressure on 
the U.S. Government. Because of this, as well as the fact that 
only 40 or so industrial goods meet the terms of tariff 
reduction, as pointed out by the units concerned, I can (?see) 
that the negotiations will be very difficult. 
  According to Huang, (?agricultural and industrial) 
departments do not have the so-called second optional plan. But 
if the U.S. side insists on discussing the issue of the range of 
variable tariff reductions, industrial departments should be 
psychologically prepared to discuss this issue with the U.S. 
side although they may not have to promise a specific range of 
reduction. The U.S. side has indicated time and again that the 
results of the negotiations will have a bearing on the timing of 
the formal ROC-U.S. negotiations on tariff reductions. 
  As for whether or not the two sides will renegotiate a 
variable tariff reduction prior to bilateral formal negotiations 
on tariff reductions if the upcoming negotiations cannot satisfy 
the two sides, Director Huang indicated that this is not very 
likely because both the ROC and the United States intend to hold 
formal negotiations on tariff reductions in February. 
  Huang also disclosed that of the list of 699 products which 
the United States demands have their tariffs be reduced 
flexibly, the percentage of tariff reductions for 31 industrial 
goods has already met the U.S. requirements, and so there will 
only be 668 products for which variable tariff reductions will 
be discussed. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] Extended measures aimed at removing the Republic of 
China's name from a list of countries threatened with sanctions 
by the United States over intellectual property rights (IPR) 
were issued yesterday by officials meeting at the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs. 
  Government bodies involved in the IPR issue were requested 
to 
draft explanatory notes detailing their responses and efforts 
thus far for presentation to U.S. officials and private bodies 
as the government here seeks to consolidate gains from recent 
legislation. 
  The ROC [Republic of China] last April was first placed on a 
"priority watch list" of 16 nations ordered to step up measures 
against IPR violations or face retaliation under the United 
States Trade Representative's package of sanctions known as 
Super 301. 
  Taiwan and Thailand were the only nations retained on the 
list when it was revised last August. 
  On January 3, the USTR's office requested reports from those 
two nations prior to a further reassessment. 
  The officials, representing the MOEA [Ministry of Economic 
Affairs], the Ministry of Justice, The Legislative Yuan, and 
Ministry of the Interior met yesterday for the 14th session of 
the inter-ministerial task force on IPR. The task force meets 
about every two months on issues regarding enforcement of 
international copyright law. 
  Concrete progress on IPR issues was reviewed, including full 
passage by the legislature of the Cable Television Law last 
November and the finalization of amendments to the Intellectual 
Property law in December, which combined to significantly 
strengthen enforcement of international statutes. 
  Still before the legislature is a bill on recordings which 
will further clarify regulations on the production, purchase and 
rental and audio and video tapes. 
  Other measures include the planned establishment of a 
special 
intellectual property rights bureau under the MOEA. 
  The MOEA last night said present efforts of the 
inter-ministerial group were focused in the categories of 
legislation, prosecution under the law, and spot checks on shops 
and entertainment establishments and strengthening customs 
enforcement. Those measures have been aided by cooperation with 
the U.S. government and private groups including the 
International Anti-counterfeiting Coalition, Inc.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- Economics Minister P.K. 
Chiang Wednesday [19 January] called on government agencies to 
help smooth Taiwan's admission into the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). 
  WTO will be inaugurated in January 1995 to replace the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Taiwan submitted 
its application for GATT membership in 1990. 
  Taiwan must complete all preparatory work and map out a 
solid 
strategy for admission by the end of October, Chiang said during 
a report to the ruling Kuomintang's policy-making central 
Standing Committee. 
  In his report, Chiang said concerned government agencies 
should review existing trade and economic practices, determine 
which are not compatible with GATT rules and make proper 
adjustments. 
  In the mean time, the government must accelerate its plans 
to 
open Taiwan to foreign services and crystalize its economic and 
trade systems. 
  Chiang said that GATT or WTO membership would inevitably 
harm 
the interests of certain sectors and communication between the 
parties concerned is a must. 
  "A remedy, including even subsidies, should be considered 
for 
those hard hit," Chiang said.

  [Text] Harbin, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Heilongjiang Province has maintained a steady growth in its 
border trade with Russia and other members of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States (CIS) since 1987. 
  The province recorded a record of 2.6 billion Swiss 
francs-worth of border trade with Russia last year, up 30 
percent from the previous year and almost eight times the figure 
for 1987, according to Cai Kaifu, chief of the provincial border 
trade administrative bureau. 
  The province, sharing a 3,05-km border with Russia, enjoys a 
roaring trade with that country. 
  Seizing the opportunities created by China's opening and 
reforms, the province has quickened its steps in promoting its 
border trade. 
  It has hosted four annual provincial trade fairs since 1990, 
which have drawn business people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, 
Eastern European countries, Russia and other members of the CIS. 
  The province has so far opened 21 border cities. 
  With its easy access to Russia and other neighboring 
countries, the province has attracted more than 6,000 
enterprises from over 100 cities in China. They have set up 
trade offices and export products to Russia. 
  The province now exports more than 4,000 varieties of goods 
to Russia, whereas only a dozen kinds of exports were available 
in 1987. 
  Motor vehicles, airplanes and mechanical products take up 80 
percent of the province's total imports. Meanwhile, exports of 
grain, edible oil and canned food in 1993 were twice the 
previous year's figures, but there was a slight drop in exports 
of garments and shoes. 
  Economic co-operation with the CIS involved one billion 
Swiss 
francs last year, three times the previous year's figure. 
  So far, more than 5,000 border trade companies of the 
province have co-operation partners all over the CIS.

<F P=106> ["Speech by Jiang Zemin to the Third Plenary Session of the </F>
14th CPC Central Committee on 14 November 1993"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jan (XINHUA) -- Comrades: 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
will come to an end today. This is a successful session of 
historical significance. The "Decision of the CPC Central 
Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted at the session 
specifies -- in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress -- the goals and 
basic principles for restructuring the economy set by the 14th 
CPC National Congress, further expands those goals and 
principles in some areas, and formulates the overall plan for 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. 
This is our program of action ao restructure the economy in the 
nineties. It will surely exert a major and far-reaching impact 
on China's reform, opening, and socialist modernization drive. 
  I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to bring 
up some points with regard to the current situation, the 
implementation of the "decision," and ways to build up the party 
and exercise effective party leadership. 
<H5>  I. On the Current Situation </H5>
  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
speeches in early 1992 and the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, we have opened up a new situation in work in 
all sectors over the past year. The economy is growing 
vigorously, fresh progress has been made in implementing 
measures of reform and opening up aimed at establishing a 
socialist market economic system, and new achievements have been 
scored in all other undertakings. Today, the country enjoys 
economic development, political stability, national unity, and 
social progress. The overall situation is decidedly good. 
  This year, the economy has maintained its momentum of fast 
growth on top of the breakneck growth recorded in 1992. The 
gross national product grew by 13.3 percent in the first three 
quarters. It is expected that this high growth rate will be 
maintained for the whole year. Industrial production by 
enterprises at the village level or higher is expected to grow 
by about 21 percent. A comparatively good harvest has been 
reported in the agricultural sector. As for some prominent 
contradictions and problems that have emerged in the course of 
the breakneck economic growth, the CPC Central Committee and 
State Council have taken a slew of measures to solve them. 
Particularly the measures we have taken since June to strengthen 
and improve macroeconomic regulation and control and to rectify 
order in the banking and other economic sectors have -- thanks 
to the common efforts of all quarters over the past few months 
-- have yielded positive results. The situation in the banking 
sector is stabilizing. The overheated development in real 
estate and development zones as well as the excessive growth in 
investment have been brought under control. The construction of 
key state projects has picked up speed and inflation has, more 
or less, been brought under control. Prices in the foreign 
exchange swap market have decreased and have basically returned 
to normal. By and large, no IOU's were issued in procuring 
agricultural and sideline products harvested in the summer; 
funds for autumn-harvested crops have been allocated. Prices of 
major capital goods including steel products have come down 
again. The situation in terms of state revenues and 
expenditures has improved somewhat. Income has continued to 
increase in both urban and rural areas. The economy as a whole 
is developing in a sound manner. Facts have borne out that the 
measures taken by the CPC Central Committee and State Council to 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control are 
absolutely correct and necessary. Judging from the current 
trends, we will still be able to maintain a rather fast economic 
growth rate and bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. 
  Reform and opening up have picked up pace noticeably this 
year. Many major reform measures are either being carried out or 
will soon be promulgated. This year, we have seized the 
opportunity and taken big steps in implementing price reforms by 
freeing the prices of many industrial capital goods. Over 90 
percent of the counties (cities) have lifted price controls over 
grain procurement and procurement and selling prices. The 
degree of the application of market prices has, on the whole, 
risen continuously. Opening up to the outside world has 
continued to develop both in scope and in depth, and there has 
been a new upsurge in foreign investment in China. One of the 
main characteristics for strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control is the idea of solving the 
contradictions and problems in the march forward by deepening 
reforms and by employing mostly economic and legal means 
supplemented, certainly, with the necessary administrative 
means. Practice has shown that this approach is successful. 
This has provided us with valuable experience, showing us that 
the fundamental way to solve the deep-seated problems in 
economic and social development lies in deepening reform. 
  The present social and political situation in the country 
is also good. This year has seen the transition from the old 
leading bodies to the new, following the smooth change of terms 
in people's congresses, governments, and committees for the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the 
central as well as local levels, and the convening of national 
congresses, one after another, for mass organizations such as 
the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, 
and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. New progress has 
been made in building a socialist democracy and legal system 
with the formulation of some major laws and regulations. 
Propaganda and ideological work have been strengthened. The 
central authorities have paid attention to promoting clean 
administration and the anticorruption struggle, with the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Council 
having made specific arrangements which are currently being 
implemented in earnest by various localities and departments. 
Even closer ties have been forged between the party and the 
masses following the investigation and handling of some serious 
and major cases and the checking of some malpractice. The 
social and economic order has been maintained, thanks to the 
further strengthening of the comprehensive management of public 
security, the prompt defeat of domestic and foreign hostile 
forces' plots to create disturbances, and the proper handling of 
some emergencies. 
  Generally speaking, developments and changes in the 
international situation also are favorable to us. The world 
will likely enjoy a relatively long period of peace following 
the end of the confrontation between the East and the West. The 
further improvement of our nation's relations with neighboring 
countries, in particular, is conducive to creating peaceful 
surroundings and an international environment favorable to 
economic construction. A worldwide economic structural 
readjustment would help us attract foreign investment and 
technology. The Asia-Pacific region's growing influence on the 
world also is favorable to us. 
  In short, the present domestic and international situation 
is 
comparatively favorable, and we really are facing a great 
opportunity for reform and development. There are not many 
historical opportunities like this. We must seize the favorable 
opportunity; quicken the pace of reform, opening up to the 
outside world, and modernization; and further enhance our 
composite national strength. It was based exactly on this 
consideration that the Central Committee Political Bureau had 
suggested that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee make a decision on the issue of establishing a 
socialist market economic system, seek a common understanding 
and uniform steps throughout the party, vigorously deepen 
reform, and promote economic development. We believe that our 
nation's reform, opening up to the outside world, and 
modernization will take on a new aspect after this plenary 
session. 
<H3>  II. Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the 
"Decision" </H3>
  Since the 14th CPC National Congress determined the goal of 
establishing a socialist market economic system, comrades from 
different quarters have hoped for a further step forward in 
formulating a more complete and systematic argument on the 
socialist market economic system to facilitate the better 
organization and advancement of the reform of the economic 
structure. We all noticed that while market mechanisms are 
playing an increasingly important role in our economic life, the 
sluggishness of reform in certain fields has adversely affected 
the establishment of a new system and the healthy development of 
the national economy. We have made breakthroughs and 
accumulated experience in reforms in various fields over the 
past decade or so, and we also have conditions ready for 
bringing about the overall advancement of the reform. We now 
need to formulate an overall plan and to stress standardization 
in our system and policies. Although the basic framework 
outlined by the decision of this plenary session for the 
socialist market economic system still needs to be examined and 
continuously improved in practice, its existence can enhance our 
ability to anticipate the kind of guidance needed for the reform 
work and make the reform even more fruitful. 
  The "decision" is rich and all-embracing in its contents, 
with all 50 of its articles being of great significance. Here I 
would like to present a few opinions on implementing the 
guidelines of the "decision": 
  1. Correctly handle the relations between reform 
and development. With fairly favorable conditions at home 
and abroad and with China's great potential for economic 
development, it is possible to maintain a comparatively high 
growth rate for a long period. It is necessary for us to focus 
on economic development, seize the current favorable 
opportunities, and concentrate our efforts on improving the 
economic situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is absolutely correct 
when he says that "development is the last word" and "the final 
resolution of the problems lies in developing the economy." We 
should follow the guiding spirit of the plenary meeting and 
waste no time in introducing various already-prepared reform 
measures so as to create a favorable structure and conditions 
for the economy. In arranging economic work, it is necessary to 
pay attention to creating a pliable environment for reform. New 
thinking is also needed for development, which should truly be 
directed at focusing on economic performance rather than on the 
same old road of extensive management which indiscriminately 
seeks greater output value and expands the extent of investment. 
The state can become rich and strong and the people's 
livelihood can be improved only when production is improved and 
more wealth is created. The experience of many years tell us 
that we should pay attention to two major things at all times: 
strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the 
national economy, and improving state-owned large- and 
medium-sized enterprises. As for agricultural problems, the CPC 
Central Committee has already convened a meeting and formulated 
general and specific policies. It is imperative to 
conscientiously organize people to carry out these policies to 
ensure the stable development of agriculture and the overall 
rural economy. From now time, more efforts should be made to 
improve state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises. The 
reinvigoration of China's economy depends mainly on state-owned 
large- and medium- sized enterprises. Many problems now facing 
us can be solved by deepening reforms. The reform of 
state-owned large- and medium- sized enterprises is a key and 
difficult point in China's efforts to reform its economic 
structure. The "decision" has been a big step forward in the 
thinking about reforming enterprises because it has 
distinctively pointed out the problems of building a modern 
enterprise system. The "decision" summarizes the basic 
characteristics of the modern enterprise system and points out 
the orientation for the reform of enterprises. It is imperative 
to thoroughly deepen the reform of enterprises in accordance 
with the requirements of the "decision" so as to truly improve 
state-owned enterprises and to enable it to play a guiding and 
backbone role in economic development. This is not only an 
important economic issue which affects the development of the 
national economy as a whole but also an important political 
issue which affects the destiny of socialism. We should work 
hard to resolve this issue. 
  2. Correctly handle the relations between 
strengthening macrocontrol and developing the role of the 
market. A socialist market economy is integrated with the 
basic system of socialism. The establishment of a socialist 
market economy seeks to enable the market to play a fundamental 
role in the allocation of resources, under the state's 
macrocontrol. The macrocontrol of the state and the role of the 
market mechanism, both of which are essential requirements of 
the socialist market economic structure, are integrated, 
mutually supplementary, and mutually promoting. To change the 
traditional planned economic system, it is necessary to 
emphasize the importance of fully permitting the market's 
fundamental role in allocating resources. If we fail to do so, 
there will be no socialist market economy. But, we should also 
see the negative aspects of spontaneity, rashness, and 
sluggishness existing in the market. Such weaknesses and 
inadequacies need to be amended and overcome by the state's 
macroguidance and -control of market activities. In today's 
world, there is not a single country whose economy is not under 
the government's control. Being a socialist country, China 
should do a good job and have better conditions for doing so in 
macroeconomic regulation and control. The current problems are: 
The market is not completely permitted to play its role in many 
respects, and there exist the phenomena of unbridled development 
and a chaotic economic order in the market. We should actively 
cultivate and develop the market system, continue to carry out 
the reform of the price and commodity circulation system, 
develop the factors of production market, and improve and 
strengthen the control, management, and supervision of the 
market. Practices in 1993 also show that to establish a 
socialist market economic structure, it is necessary to work 
hard both in giving full play to the role of market mechanisms 
and in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. The 
key points of the work for each period may be different. 
According to various actual conditions, sometimes more emphasis 
will be placed on the role of the market and sometimes on the 
macrocontrol by the state. But, while emphasizing one aspect, we 
must not neglect or pay no attention to the other side. 
  3. We must give equal emphasis to two fronts and do 
well in both. In the course of implementing reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive, we must consistently 
persist in the principle of giving equal emphasis to two fronts 
and doing well in both. Having learned a profound lesson in 
this regard, we must never repeat the mistake of emphasizing one 
to the neglect of the other. 
  At a time when everyone is focusing on promoting reform and 
opening up and developing the economy, we must not overlook the 
promotion of spiritual civilization. Emphasizing the principles 
and tasks of promoting socialist spiritual civilization, the 
"decision" sets out some requirements, particularly in pointing 
out that under a socialist market economy, we should actively 
propagate the need to persist in a correct outlook on life and a 
civilized, healthy style of life and work to promote public and 
professional ethics. All these remarks have specific aims. It 
is a fact of life that money worship, extreme individualism, 
decadent life-styles, and other social evils are spreading, some 
of which have developed to quite a serious extent. We must take 
resolute steps to combat them. We must unequivocally encourage 
what is right, overcome what is evil, and promote in the whole 
society a good social climate that is eminently healthy, 
progressive, and positive. We must carry forward our fine 
national culture and traditions, learn from the fruits of all 
advanced foreign civilizations and, however, never mistake their 
dregs for their best parts. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong spoke this famous dictum: "The 
unification of the state, the unity of the people, and the 
solidarity of the nationalities in the country -- these are the 
fundamental guarantees of the success of our cause." Without 
political unity and stability, we will not be able to accomplish 
anything. Generally speaking, the situation today is good. We 
must be prepared for danger in times of peace and never lower 
our guard or become careless. We must strengthen judicial, 
procuratorial, and public security work and improve all facets 
of public security, strengthen the legal system, step up law 
enforcement, and punish according to the law all sorts of 
crimes. We must correctly handle the contradictions within the 
people and promptly remove all destabilizing factors to 
consolidate the political situation characterized by stability 
and unity. We must conscientiously carry out the party's 
policies on nationalities and religion and extensively carry out 
education featuring Marxist views on nationalities and religion. 
  Continued efforts should be made to carry out the fight 
against corruption. Building a clean government and combating 
corruption constitute essential conditions for the establishment 
of the socialist market economic structure. These also have a 
great bearing on the destiny of the ongoing reform and on the 
destiny of the party and the country. The Central Committee's 
line, principles, and policies for the anticorruption struggle 
are clear and specific, and they enjoy the heartfelt support of 
the vast ranks of cadres and people. The focal points of this 
struggle are leading party and government organs, 
law-enforcement departments, and economic administrative 
departments, as well as the investigation and prosecution of 
major cases. Party members, high- and middle- ranking cadres in 
particular, must heighten their awareness and set a good example 
by being honest and observing discipline. As for those corrupt 
elements, we must punish them in accordance with state laws and 
party discipline, no matter who they are. We must not tolerate 
or abet their wrongdoing. The fight against corruption is a 
long-term and arduous task and should be carried out with 
unremitting effort. We must see to it that the targets set by 
the Central Committee for the different periods of this struggle 
are attained. 
  4. Fully mobilize all positive factors and bring 
the initiatives of all sides into play. Whether in the 
past revolutionary war or during the current reform, opening, 
and modernization construction, only by closely relying on the 
broad mass of cadres and the masses, by fully bringing into play 
the initiatives of all sides, and by pooling the wisdom and 
efforts of everyone can we expect to achieve success. We have 
always stressed the need to bring into play the initiatives of 
both the central government and local governments. The 
"decision," by giving full consideration to our country's actual 
conditions and to work in localities, formulated the direction 
and principles of the reforms of the fiscal, taxation, and 
financial systems. The purpose of employing a tax-sharing 
system, of a rational division of jurisdiction between the 
central and local governments, and of determining the 
revenue-expense ratio between the central and local governments 
in a rational manner is to straighten out the economic 
relationship and to standardize economic activities. 
Strengthening the central bank's regulatory and supervisory 
functions over the currency, separating policy-related financing 
from commercial financing, and attaining a unified exchange rate 
constitute a major reform of the financial system which involves 
readjusting the relationship between the interests of the 
central government and those of localities. A reform of fiscal, 
taxation, and financial structures is required to develop a 
socialist market economy, which is not only compatible with 
accepted international practices but which also takes into 
account China's characteristics and reality. By so doing, it 
will be conducive to giving play to the initiatives of the 
central government and that of localities, to doing an even 
better job of economic construction, and to attaining 
coordinated socioeconomic development. When dealing with the 
relationship between the central government and localities, the 
central government should give consideration to localities' 
difficulties. As for localities, they should establish the 
concept of the national interest. Whereas the national interest 
should take care of local interests, local interests should 
subordinate themselves to the national interest. The fact that 
a consensus over the reform plan for fiscal, taxation, and 
financial structures has been reached through discussion and 
coordination shows that everyone has taken the national interest 
into consideration and that everyone upholds the concept of the 
national interest. We should fully understand the far-reaching 
significance of the reform, and with one heart and one mind and 
with joint efforts, we should accomplish the reform tasks. 
  Our country is a vast country. Economic development in 
various regions is rather imbalanced. Because there are 
historical reasons for the regional imbalances, it will take 
time to narrow these gaps. The policy and principles of the 
party and the state are to bring two initiatives into play: the 
initiative of the economically developed regions and that of the 
less developed regions. Our basic principle in this respect is 
clear. It is advisable for economically developed regions to 
fully make use of their own advantageous conditions and existing 
foundation to achieve even faster development, to rapidly raise 
the economy to new heights, to help promote development in 
less-developed regions, and to make an even greater contribution 
to the country's modernization undertaking. To gradually 
realize the goal of common prosperity, the state has adopted 
policies to vigorously support economic development in 
less-developed regions of central and western China. With the 
deepening of reform and the expansion of reform, regions in 
central and western China have gradually improved their 
conditions for developing the economy. Through their own 
efforts and with the state's support, it is completely possible 
that they can gradually accelerate the pace of development by 
fully bringing into play their advantages, including natural 
resources and other advantages. 
  When dealing with the relationship between the state, 
enterprises, and staff members and workers, it is necessary to 
bring initiatives into play. Within the enterprises, it is 
necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of the party 
organization, of management personnel, and of all staff members 
and workers. Among the people, it is necessary to bring into 
play the initiatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and 
people from various circles. It is necessary to enhance national 
unity and to bring into play the initiatives of all 
nationalities in the nation. We should develop the enthusiasm 
of trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's 
federations, and other mass organizations, as well as democratic 
parties. Mobilizing the initiatives of the broad mass of cadres 
and the masses depends on deepening reform and perfecting 
various systems; and it is also necessary to rely on ideological 
and political work to exploit our political advantages. 
  All in all, our principle is to give full play to the 
initiatives of all sides, to mobilize all positive factors, to 
turn negative factors into positive ones, and to devote all our 
energy to the great undertaking of socialist modernization 
construction. By so doing, our reform, opening, and economic 
construction will be provided with the broadest and deepest mass 
foundation and will keep on developing with great vigor. 
<H3>  III. On Strengthening Party Building and the Leadership of 
the Party </H3>
  Establishing a socialist market economic structure and 
accelerating the pace of modernization are great historical 
tasks in the new period. To lead this unprecedented pioneering 
work and to achieve success, our party must effectively 
strengthen its own ideology, organization, and work style. 
  1. It is necessary to strengthen the party's 
ideological construction and to arm the whole party with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. A party, a nation and a country, 
especially a big party like ours and a country composed of 
people of 56 different nationalities with a population of more 
than 1 billion, must have correct theoretical guidance and 
powerful spiritual support. Now we are in the midst of a 
profound social change in the course of reform, opening up, and 
modernization, and great changes are taking place in social 
relations and the social and economic outlooks. To assume the 
historical responsibility for leading this great change, our 
party must have correct theoretical guidance and powerful 
spiritual support. Otherwise, the whole party and the whole 
country cannot have strong rallying power, will lack unity as 
did the old China, and cannot have great strength. Ideological 
construction is the foundation for improving our organization 
and work style. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics has brought forward and 
developed Mao Zedong Thought, and it is contemporary Marxism in 
China [dang dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yu -- 3981 0108 0022 
0948 4104 7456 0344 0674 0031 5030]. We must use this theory to 
arm the whole party, the whole Army, and people of all 
nationalities of our country. The party Central Committee has 
made a decision about studying the third volume of the "Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping," and so comrades of the whole party, 
especially leading cadres at and above the county level, must 
conscientiously study it in light of actual conditions. We 
should carry forward the Marxist study style of combining theory 
with practice, seriously study the original works, have a good 
grasp of their essence, and implement the guidelines in line 
with the actual situation of various departments and localities. 
You comrades here are members and alternate members of the CPC 
Central Committee and responsible comrades of the party, 
government, Army, and masses organizations, and so you must take 
the lead in studying well the book to increase your political, 
ideological, and leadership quality and to enhance your 
consciousness of firmly implementing the party's basic line. 
This is a matter of fundamental importance to successfully 
promote reform, opening up and the modernization drive. 
  2. It is necessary to strengthen the building of the 
party organizationally. The strength of the party lies in 
the unity of the party and in good organization and strict 
discipline. To strengthen the party's organizational 
construction, we have to do many things. Here I only want to 
stress three points. First, it is imperative to firmly 
implement the party's principle of democratic centralism. Only 
by adhering to the principle of democratic centralism can we 
unify our understanding and steps. Party organizations at 
various levels must consciously place the interests of the party 
and state at the top spot; their local interests must be 
subordinated to the interests of the whole; their immediate 
interests must be subordinated to long- term interests; and they 
must take the overall situation into consideration, guarantee 
the implementation of various principles and policies of the 
party Central Committee, and maintain a high degree of unity 
politically, organizationally, and in their actions. The 
practices of not carrying out orders and not banning things 
which should be banned are extremely unfavorable to our cause 
and will not be tolerated by party discipline. Second, it is 
necessary to enhance the building of the party's grassroots 
organizations. Party's grassroots organizations are the party's 
foundation. Only with a solid foundation can the entire party 
be assured of having powerful fighting strength, can it 
withstand the test of any upheavals. Implementing the 
"decision" requires the joint efforts of all levels of party 
organizations. Grass-roots party organizations are also 
required to carry out hard and meticulous work and help 
translate the party's decision into the action of the masses. 
It is necessary to make great determination to build the 
party's grassroots organizations into a fighting force that will 
unite and lead the masses to realize the party's goals. Third, 
it is necessary to enhance the building of all levels of leading 
bodies. The key lies in following the principle of making the 
contingent of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age, 
better educated, and professionally more competent, and in 
selecting and promoting cadres who meet the requirements of 
being able and having political integrity. To help our party 
organizations retain vigor and vitality, it is necessary to 
promote those cadres, particularly young and middle-aged cadres, 
who are loyal to the cause of the party, who vigorously promote 
reform, opening, and modernization construction, to all levels 
of leading posts. 
  3. Enhance investigation and study; improve work style 
and way of thinking. Time is advancing. The situation is 
evolving. New situations and new problems keep coming up. All 
levels of leading organs and leading cadres should strive to 
improve leadership styles and methods so as to keep up with the 
pace of the times. It is necessary to treat this matter from 
the high plane of improving the quality of leadership and 
governing [zhi zheng 1013 2398]. With so much work to do, all 
levels of party's leading cadres, senior-level cadres in 
particular, should comprehensively implement the guidelines set 
forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and the decision adopted 
at the present plenary session, improve their ability to master 
the overall situation, and arrange work in all respects. Since 
next year will be a very important year to promote reform and 
the tasks will be very arduous and demanding, we must properly 
handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability, and strive to maintain a stable political environment 
and a sound economic environment. All levels of leaders should 
not only know well their advantageous conditions and seize 
opportunities for development, but also forsee well 
contradictions and difficulties in the course of progress and do 
a good job in a down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to 
correctly grasp and handle well major theoretical and practical 
problems, to persist in materialist dialectics, avoid 
one-sidedness and metaphysics, remove interference, and always 
and unwaveringly adhere to party's basic line. We should go 
deep down to the front line of reform and construction; conduct 
serious investigation and study; discover problems in a timely 
manner; proceed from reality; work creatively; constantly sum up 
experiences; and be good at utilizing experiences created by the 
masses to guide their progress. The CPC Central Committee has 
on many occasions called on all levels of leading cadres to step 
up investigation and study. It will be impossible to perform 
well a leader's duty if he or she makes light of investigation 
and study, if he or she does not understand well their work, if 
he or she is blind to reality. If we can squeeze a little bit 
more time for studying, cut back time spent on socializing, do a 
little more investigation and study, refrain from acting 
subjectively, do more concrete things, and stop making empty 
speeches, then we will be able to greatly raise our leadership 
level. 
  Comrades! 
  Our country is now in a very important historical period. 
The burden on our shoulders is onerous. We carry enormous 
responsibilities. We should, in a spirit of bearing a high 
sense of responsibility toward the party, the state, and the 
Chinese nation, always and steadfastly follow Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and party's basic line; hold fast to the central 
task of the economic construction; unwaveringly develop a 
socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, and 
socialist spiritual civilization; emancipate the mind; seek 
truth from facts; work with one heart and one mind; display a 
pioneering and enterprising spirit; rely on our own efforts; 
build an enterprise through arduous effort; and strive to build 
our country into a rich, strong, democratic, civilized, and 
modern socialist country!

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji will resign from his post 
as governor of the People's Bank of China at the next meeting of 
the National People's Congress in March, according to sources in 
the banking industry. Mr Zhu, who took over as head of the 
central bank on July 2 last year, is expected to be succeeded by 
People's Bank Deputy Governor Zhu Xiaohua. Bank sources said 
the Vice-Premier was only appointed bank governor as an 
emergency measure after the failure of the incumbent Li Guixian 
to deal with the financial crisis which hit China in the first 
half of 1993. 
  It was "perfectly normal" that Mr Zhu should give up the 
post 
and appoint a specialist full time head for the central bank 
once the crisis had passed, they said. "Zhu Rongji as 
Vice-Premier has a very broad range of responsibilities 
concerning overall economic policy but being the governor of the 
People's Bank is a very demanding job requiring a lot of 
energy," a source said. "It is impossible for one man to do 
both jobs for a long period of time, the demands are too great," 
he added. "The governor should be a specialist who can take on 
the responsibility of managing the financial sector while Zhu 
Rongji concentrates on the important task of directing overall 
economic reform and development," he said. 
  Another reason given for the Vice Premier's imminent 
retirement from the People's Bank is that the Government is 
determined to give the country's central bank at least the 
appearance of independence. A key element in the financial 
reforms to be implemented this year is making the People's Bank 
more autonomous from the central Government and as one source 
pointed out, "You cannot have an independent central bank which 
is governed by the Vice-Premier." 
  The man expected to take over as governor of the bank, Zhu 
Xiaohua, is a former deputy head of the Shanghai People's Bank 
who worked closely with Mr Zhu while he was mayor of Shanghai in 
the late 1980s. He is widely admired both within the People's 
Bank and the foreign banking community in China, as a highly 
skilled and competent financial official who could carry out the 
difficult and complex reforms which will have to be undertaken 
if the institution is to become a genuine central bank as 
recognised in the West. Zhu Xiaohua was appointed Deputy 
Governor of the People's Bank after Zhu Rongji was made Vice 
Premier in 1991 and became the economic czar's most trusted 
adviser after he took over as head of the central bank last year. 
  With Zhu Xiaohua as governor of the People's Bank, sources 
said, the Vice-Premier would feel comfortable the central bank 
was being managed in accordance with his own economic policies. 
But while Zhu Xiaohua is the Vice-Premier's choice as 
successor, it is by no means certain the rest of the state 
council will agree to his appointment. It is understood Zhu 
Rongji still has a lot of lobbying to do before his man is 
confirmed as the new governor of the People's Bank.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and Sharon Fung] </F>
  [Text] Overseas fund management companies will soon gain 
access to the mainland market through sweeping reforms 
establishing domestic trade in unit trusts. 
  The move will free mainland investors to buy and sell both 
foreign and local-invested unit trusts and mutual funds for the 
first time and allow domestic companies to offer their own funds 
to mainland buyers. 
  As a result of market liberalisation, Chinese fund 
management 
companies will also be permitted to list on the country's two 
stock markets, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to Chinese 
sources. 
  The People's Bank of China has approved the listing of six 
newly established fund-management companies and endorsed more to 
be traded over the counter throughout the country. 
  "As a reform package was recently approved by the central 
authorities, China is set to introduce an institutional 
investment system," a Chinese economist said on Saturday. 
  "And through the introduction of Western-style instruments, 
along with the existing reforms in banking, fiscal and 
securities regulations, China is expected to fully embrace a 
capitalist-style financial market in the next few years." 
  The companies so far approved to list in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen are Shanghai Jianye Fund Management, Baoding Fund 
Management, Jinlong Fund Management, Shenzhen Lantian Fund 
Management, Tianji Fund Management and Yangguang Fund Management. 
  However, Beijing was not in haste to lure foreign funds 
until 
it had initiated related regulations, the source said. 
  He said regulations on Administration of Investment Funds 
were now under deliberation by the central bank, a cabinet-level 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, and the Finance 
Ministry. 
  The regulations will then be submitted to the State Council 
for final endorsement. 
  Chinese sources said Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was 
an 
enthusiastic supporter of the reforms. 
  Zhu, China's financial troubleshooter, was quoted as saying 
that it was healthier to introduce an institutional investment 
system than to encourage individual investors. 
  Paul Pong Po-lam, managing director of Pegasus Fund 
Management, said approval for investment funds to list on the 
mainland's stock exchange will encourage the industry's 
development in the country. 
  He said that China was now in need of cash for its huge 
infrastructural developments throughout the country. 
  "Raising money by funds is the most convenient form of 
financing," Pong said. 
  As a result of 14 years of economic reforms, disposable 
incomes have increased and people are now looking for 
alternative investment opportunities. 
  Tim Greaton of Credit Lyonnais said the present environment 
in China was qualified for investment funds as economic reforms 
had pushed the country towards a more Western-style market 
economy. 
  However, he doubted if the listing of investment funds in 
China would really be noticed overseas. 
  "I don't think that foreign funds are really conscious of 
the 
development of China local funds or the recent approval for 
their listing," he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong's post-1997 administration now stands to 
inherit close to $200 billion [Hong Kong (HK) dollars], not 
including vast foreign cash reserves that support the HK dollar 
or proceeds from the sale of land along the airport railway, 
according to new projections from Hong Kong and Beijing. 
  China's man in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, told 
Hong Kong Fujian businessmen that the special administrative 
region's (SAR) share of land sales, lodged in the Land Fund, 
could reach $100 billion by the changeover. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod predicted in his 
March 
Budget that fiscal reserves - excluding the SAR Land Fund - to 
be handed over on June 30, 1997, would be $78 billion. However, 
latest estimates suggest Sir Hamish will finish the year with a 
huge surplus, possibly close to $20 billion, instead of the 
modest deficit of $3.36 billion he had budgeted for. If the 
healthy trend continues and the administration draws nothing 
from the reserves, $100 billion could be accumulated by 1997. 
  And if Mr Lu is correct the SAR kitty will be doubled by the 
$100 billion from the Land Fund. 
  The territory's Exchange Fund, used to protect the value of 
the HK dollar, was already $287 billion at the end of 1992, 
making Hong Kong the 10th biggest holder of foreign currency 
reserves in the world. 
  Extra land income resulting from a booming economy is 
believed to be a key factor in inflating Mr Lu's expectations 
from the Land Fund, although he did not elaborate on his 
projections. The strong property market has seen land prices 
breaking records in the last year. 
  Proceeds from property development along the proposed 
airport 
railway projects have not been included in these forecasts as 
China and Britain have yet to agree on the financing of the 
railway plan. 
  Despite the growing risk of slippage of the airport projects 
beyond the target opening date of mid-1997, Hong Kong officials 
remain noncommittal on whether the government will use the 
windfall surplus to substantially increase the capital injection 
into the infrastructure plan. 
  Mr Lu, the Director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, repeated that there was a need to keep 
a healthy financial position for the post-1997 government. 
  In October, the Land Fund announced that the balance of the 
fund only stood at $44.3 billion for the year ending March 31, 
1993. Mr Lu told the businessmen that although in the past it 
was estimated the Land Fund would accumulate about $70 billion, 
now it looked possible that it would reach $100 billion. The 
director revealed the figure while explaining China's rationale 
in handling the airport financing plan. "We have to act 
responsibly on behalf of the SAR government and it is the SAR 
government's duty to lay a solid financial basis for the SAR so 
that Hong Kong will have a comfortable financial position," said 
Mr Lu. "For the good of Hong Kong people, we certainly cannot 
further compromise (on the airport projects)." 
  To ensure that Hong Kong will enjoy a better financial 
basis, 
the Chinese side has requested the British side leave $25 
billion in the kitty by 1997 and make sure that Government 
borrowings do not exceed $5 billion, according to Mr Lu. These 
requirements are already written down in the airport memorandum.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The development 
zone in Nantong city, Jiangsu Province, is attracting large 
foreign corporations. 
  According to Qian Zhongyi, chairman of the zone's 
Administration Committee, the zone had become home to 130 
foreign-funded enterprises with a combined investment totalling 
400 million U.S. dollars by the end of last year. It is now 
holding talks with overseas business people on the setting up of 
30 more projects. 
  In addition, an increasing number of foreign-funded 
enterprises have reinvested in the zone. 
  Located on the northern part of the estuary of the Chang 
Jiang River, China's longest, the five-sq-km Nantong development 
zone is fully occupied by foreign-funded projects, and is being 
expanded. 
  Qian noted that 95 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises 
are profitable. Their per capita gross profits rank fifth among 
development zones in China's 14 open coastal cities. 
  Qian predicted that foreign investment will surge ahead this 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan Affairs 
Offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council today 
invited officials engaged in Taiwan affairs to a forum on 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. They discussed at length the great theoretical 
and practical significance of Comrade Xiaoping's scientific 
concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" 
and held that all-level leaders and cadres should study further 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought for solving the Taiwan question 
to improve work related to Taiwan and promote the motherland's 
reunification. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the Chinese People's 
Political 
Consultation Conference National Committee and director of the 
Taiwan Affairs Offices, chaired the forum. He said: "One 
country, two systems" is a concrete application of 
Marxism-Leninism based on China's realities and the special 
features of the times; it is a product of the party's 
ideological line of seeking truth from facts, as well as an 
important component of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thought, we have scored remarkable achievements in Taiwan 
affairs in recent years. The party Central Committee has 
attached great importance to work related to Taiwan, of which 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin has taken a personal charge. 
Under the new circumstances, we should continue to diligently 
study and implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of "peaceful 
reunification and one country, two systems," adhere to the 
principle of one China, steadfastly safeguard national 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose "two Chinas," 
"one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan's independence" in any form. 
  Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations 
Across 
the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], said: The aim of ARATS, which is to 
promote exchanges and relations between the two sides of the 
strait, is a concrete form of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of 
"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." In view 
of the imminent arrival of the 21st century, the two sides 
should increase economic cooperation, seek to complement and 
benefit each other, and promote peaceful reunification. Comrade 
Luo Changqing, who had worked for a long time at the side of the 
late premier Zhou Enlai, related his personal experiences in 
discussing gains from studying Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping. He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
concept of "one country, two systems" is an inheritance and 
development of the guidelines for Taiwan affairs laid down by 
Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other revolutionaries of the 
older generation, as well as the basic principle guiding the 
party's work related to Taiwan. Comrade Yang Side, who has been 
engaged in work related to Taiwan for many years, said: The 
concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" 
is bold in vision, judicious in policy orientation, substantive 
in content, and innovative in practice. This concept has helped 
us successfully resolve the Hong Kong and Macao questions, and 
will certainly guide us in finally settling the Taiwan question 
and realizing the motherland's reunification. Comrade Cai 
Zimin, chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League 
Central Committee, said: The people of Taiwan are imbued with 
the glorious patriotic tradition, and they have never reneged 
their affection for the motherland. "One country, two systems" 
takes into consideration the realities on the two sides of the 
strait and conforms with the Taiwan compatriots' aspiration to 
be the masters of their own country. This concept has received 
the understanding, support, and endorsement of more and more 
Taiwan compatriots. Advocates of "two Chinas" or "one China, 
one Taiwan" inside and outside the island are doomed to fail. 
  Sun Xiaoyu, Tang Shubei, Li Qingzhou, Guo Pingtan, and other 
officials of relevant departments attended the forum.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The growth of 
enterprises depends on strict internal management to ensure the 
quality of products, said Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua during a 
two-day inspection tour in Tianjin, a port city in north China. 
  While inspecting a steel-tube company, Zou stressed that in 
addition to appropriate external conditions, enterprises should 
take it as an essential point to expand the market share of 
their products on the basis of fine quality, scheduled delivery 
and good post-sales services. 
  At Tianjin port yesterday, Zou boarded the vessel "Zhenhe," 
China's first fourth-generation container ship, which was 
heading for Europe. 
  He remarked that the vessel's virgin sail indicated that 
China had become one of the countries leading the world in 
container transport, and the port was to become one of the best 
starting points in the "Eurasian bridge." 
  Port officials said that the vessel, equipped with 
state-of-the-art satellite navigation, telecommunications, and 
alarm and unmanned operation systems, is the most up-to-date 
container vessel in the world.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, a top 
Chinese leader, said the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure requires "standardization and perfect legal 
guarantee." 
  In an interview carried in the latest issue of the 
fortnightly magazine, CHINA'S TALENTS, Qiao, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said 
that China has to explore ways to shift from a planned economy 
to a market economy and to introduce a corresponding legal 
system. 
  Since 1979 the NPC and its Standing Committee have adopted 
promulgated 200 laws and regulations, he said, adding that a 
number of important laws will be enacted in the near future. 
  The enforcement of these laws have guided, standardized and 
guaranteed the creation of a market economy, he noted. 
  Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, stressed that the NPC and its Standing Committee must 
act promptly to formulate laws to standardize market behavior, 
protect the order of a market economy, and improve 
macro-economic control and social guarantee. 
  "The enactment of laws in these areas is essential to the 
establishment and perfection of a socialist market economy," the 
leader said. 
  Qiao also stressed the importance of using laws to guide, 
promote and guarantee the smooth progress of the reforms, and to 
provide a legal basis for the growth of a market economy. 
  Meanwhile, laws, decrees and regulations short of the need 
of 
the market economy must be either revised or abolished in time, 
he said. 
  He said that in formulating laws concerning the market 
economy, it was imperative to follow the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and act in the spirit of 
the party's 14th National Congress and in accordance with 
China's Constitution. 
  While formulating such laws, he said, "we must proceed from 
the reality in China, and make an extensive study and draw on 
the experience of the rest of the world." 
  All new laws must be made to facilitate the expansion of 
China's economy, and stability and unity throughout the country, 
he stressed. 
  "Since a market economy is an open one geared up with the 
global market, Chinese laws governing the market economy must be 
compatible with relevant laws in other countries and 
internationally accepted practices," he pointed out. 
  That approach will not only quicken the pace of China's 
economic legislation, but also enable China to adapt to the 
world economy and to participate in global economic competition, 
he added. 
  Qiao Shi also noted that only by taking educational, 
administrative, legal and other measures can successes be scored 
in the anti-corruption campaign. 
  Over the past few years, the NPC and its Standing Committee 
have enacted a series of new laws to crack down on embezzlement, 
bribery, smuggling, prostitution, and drug trafficking and 
abuse, he said. 
  The leader also stressed the importance of formulating and 
perfecting laws regarding the building of a clean government by 
studying characteristics and circumstances in combating 
corruption under a socialist market economy. 
  In conclusion, he expressed the belief that the 
establishment 
of a legal system governing the market economy will certainly 
help prevent corruption most effectively.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123)] </F>
  [Text] Tianjin, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- While inspecting grain 
work in Tianjin, Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee, State Councillor, and minister of the 
State Economic Restructuring Commission, pointed out the need to 
seize the opportunities at hand, carry out vigorous exploration, 
embark on bold reform, and establish a new grain system under 
the socialist market economy as soon as possible. 
  From 27 to 28 December, accompanied by leading comrades from 
the Tianjin municipal CPC Committee and Tianjin municipal 
government, Li Tieying and his party inspected the Puji River 
Course Grain Depot, Number One Flour Plant, North Station Grain 
and Edible Oil Store, a trade fair market; and heard briefings 
on grain work from the personnel of relevant departments in 
Tianjin. They also held a meeting with Gao Dezhan, secretary of 
the Tianjin municipal CPC Committee, Tianjin Mayor Zhang 
Lichang, and other comrades. 
  Li Tieying touched on the issue of recent price increases 
for 
grain and edible oil in some regions. He said that the recent 
fluctuation in the price of grain has provided food for thought. 
The fluctuation occurred on the heels of several consecutive 
years of harvests, at a time when localities reported ample 
grain reserves. This has something to do with the structural 
problem, the attitude toward grain work, circulation of hearsay 
in society, people's psychology, and the inability to adapt to 
the demands of a market economy. The fluctuation has taught us 
a lesson. Of course, we will sum up the lesson of the market 
fluctuation. We will not revert to the old system of issuing 
ration cards and grain coupons; we will instead seek a way out 
through reform. We should know that now is the best time to 
establish a new grain system. There are three reasons: First, 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
delineated a grand blueprint for the socialist market economy 
system, second, there is a relatively relaxed external 
environment, and we have an ample stock of grain, third, the 
recent market fluctuation has provided us with a real chance to 
study a grain system. 
  Li Tieying said that the grain price affects the stability 
of 
the entire market, public mood, and social stability. 
Therefore, all levels of government should attach high 
importance to the grain market and grain work and do a good job 
of the macrocontrol of grain in a timely manner. It is quite 
normal that the lifting of the control on grain prices will lead 
to some price fluctuations as well as to the readjustment of the 
production and marketing of grain because of changes in the 
supply and demand for grain. However, grain prices must not be 
allowed to rise excessively, and driving up prices is not 
allowed. To protect the interests of farmers, grain departments 
should buy up grain from farmers when the price tumbles on the 
grain market. To bring about a fall in the price, to protect 
the interests of consumers, and to reassure the mood of the 
general public, grain departments should intervene and sell off 
grain when the grain price rises excessively. 
  Li Tieying stressed that the liberalization of the grain 
price does not mean that a new grain system has already been 
established. He said it is necessary to seize the opportunity of 
having grain in storage and step up studying and formulating a 
complete and enduring grain system for China which will benefit 
farmers and consumers. He said that such a grain system should 
include the following: a grain production structure, a grain 
procurement and marketing structure, a grain price structure, a 
grain import-export structure, a macrocontrol and safeguard 
system, and a grain industry system which takes into account 
China's reality and meets the demands of a socialist market 
economy. Li Tieying particularly stressed the need to establish 
and improve a grain reserve system and a regulation fund system, 
pointing out that only with abundant storage for grain and an 
abundant storage fund can we expect to flexibly and freely 
regulate and control the market and establish a grain system 
that will promote production, guarantee supply, make the market 
thrive, stabilize prices, and reassure the public. 
  Li Tieying gave high credit to Tianjin's timely adoption of 
forceful measures to stabilize the grain market. He called on 
localities to act according to the State Council's unified 
arrangement and to immediately increase the grain supply so as 
to help stabilize commodity prices, enable the masses to have a 
peaceful and joyous new year and Spring Festival, and create a 
favorable social and economic environment for the smooth 
introduction of various reform measures next year. 
  Also accompanying Li Tieying during the inspection were Wan 
Baorui, vice agricultural minister; Ma Kai and Wang Shiyuan, 
vice ministers of the State Economic Restructuring Commission; 
and comrades from relevant departments including those from the 
Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Planning Commission, and 
the Ministry of Finance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and </F>
Economic Cooperation by staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) from 
the "Minister's Hotline" column; place and date not given: "On 
the End-of-Year Trade Deficit--an Interview With Wu Yi, Minister 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: The "Minister's Hotline" 
column has run for nearly one year, and it concludes with this 
interview. During the past year or so, we have received many 
letters from our readers and have invited 19 ministerial leading 
cadres to give their views on some flash-point economic issues 
which the readers have raised. We would like to take this 
opportunity to express our sincere thanks to the leaders and 
vast numbers of readers who have shown their concerns for and 
have supported this column. Although this column has ended, we 
still welcome our readers to write to us and raise questions. 
We will continue to answer them in various forms. 
  [Gong Wen] According to the figures provided by customs, a 
trade deficit has appeared in China's imports and exports this 
year, something has rarely happened in recent years. From 
January to November, the total volume of import and export trade 
was $164.2 billion, of which exports totaled $78.25 billion and 
imports totaled $85.95 billion, an increase of 6.2 and 27.8 
percent respectively over the same period last year. The export 
growth rate was 21.6 percentage points lower than the rate of 
import growth, with a deficit of $7.7 billion on our side. 
Would you, Minister Wu, please tell us about the main reasons 
for this deficit? 
  [Wu Yi] In my opinion, there are three main reasons: First, 
increasing demand in the domestic market. China's national 
economy grew by 12.8 percent last year, and the trend of rapid 
development has been maintained this year. It is estimated that 
this year's growth rate will reach 13 percent. This has brought 
about increases in domestic demand; in particularly, we have 
seen a rapid increase in demand for the means of production. 
The shortage of commodities for bulk exports has been a rare 
phenomenon in the past many years. Negative growth has been 
registered since the beginning of this year in the exports of 
ordinary commodities, which are important sources of state 
foreign exchange earnings. From January to November, the growth 
rate of these exports decreased by 0.6 percent over the same 
period of last year (calculated in terms of comparable items). 
  Second, the role of the market has become much broader. 
China has made an important policy decision about the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure and has 
given full play to the basic roles of the market in the 
allocation of resources under state macroeconomic regulation and 
control. At present, because price control has been relaxed 
further, the prices of approximately 90 percent of industrial 
consumer goods, 70 percent of the ex-factory prices of capital 
goods, and 85 percent of the procurement prices of agricultural 
products are decided by the market. Because of the weak prices 
in the international market and the shortage of commodity 
resources in the domestic market, prices have been rising to a 
certain extent, and the law of value has been playing a major 
role. For this reason, a decrease in the export of domestic 
commodities has appeared again. Because China has further 
relaxed control over imports, foreign commodities are entering 
the Chinese market at a considerably high growth rate. Last 
year's import volume increased by 26.4 percent compared with the 
previous year, and, from January to November this year, it 
continued to increase by 27.8 percent compared with the same 
period of last year. This fully shows that China is a large 
market with great potential. China's market is open. 
  Moreover, because of the increase in foreign exchange swap 
prices, the shortage of funds, and insufficient transportation 
facilities, foreign trade departments are working under dual 
pressures from commodity providers and foreign buyers. The 
former are trying to increase prices, while the latter are 
seeking to force prices down. In addition, as the enterprises 
engaging in foreign economic cooperation and trade are in the 
period of changing operational mechanism, with the insufficient 
macroeconomic regulation and control measures and incomplete 
implementation of the export policies and measures, the foreign 
trade and export business have been directly affected. These 
reasons are also behind the deficit. 
  [Gong] It has been learned that deficits have appeared in 
bilateral trade between China and some countries this year. For 
example, the trade deficit with Japan reached $5.48 billion in 
the first 10 months of the year, making up 77.3 percent of the 
total deficit in China's foreign trade during the same period. 
Would you please tell us how you view this problem and what 
measures should be adopted to resolve the problem? 
  [Wu] In my opinion, it is difficult to avoid having a 
deficit 
in bilateral trade. The issue is that both sides should take a 
positive and pragmatic attitude and adopt flexible methods to 
solve the problem so that it does not become an obstacle to the 
development of bilateral economic and trade relations and so 
that the deficit may not be used as a pretext for exerting 
pressure on the other side. China's basic foreign trade policy 
is to ensure equality and mutual benefit and maintain a basic 
balance between imports and exports. At present, in the face of 
the unsatisfactory export situation, we will adopt a method of 
expanding exports rather than reducing imports to achieve the 
basic balance. We export so that we can import the advanced 
technologies and equipment needed by our modernization drive and 
those materials that are in short supply in our domestic market. 
It is estimated that our import volume will reach $450 billion 
over the next five years. 
  As everyone knows, approximately 80 percent of China's 
foreign exchange comes from foreign trade and exports. If the 
deficit situation caused by slow export is not improved, China's 
foreign exchange earnings will certainly decrease, and its 
import trade will also be affected. Therefore, only on the 
basis of continuous and rapid growth of exports and by 
increasing foreign exchange earnings can the current trend of 
high-rate import growth be preserved. We hope that our trading 
partners will increase their imports of Chinese commodities so 
that bilateral trade can develop harmoniously. At the same 
time, we also hope that our trade partners with whom there is 
the problem of imbalanced trade will resolve the trade deficit 
issue on the basis of equality and mutual benefit so that the 
trade deficit does not affect the development of bilateral trade 
and economic relations. 
  [Gong] May we ask Minister Wu to predict the situation of 
China's import and export trade next year? 
  [Wu] We are resolving the trade deficit issue primarily 
through expanding exports. Therefore, we will concentrate our 
energy next year on work in the following fields of export trade. 
  First, to intensify reform of the structure of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation. Beginning in 1994, a system of 
"unification of foreign exchange rates" will be adopted, and a 
unified foreign exchange settlement system will be implemented 
in all enterprises engaging in foreign trade business and the 
export trade. At the same time, a unitary and well-managed 
floating exchange rate system for the renminbi based on market 
supply and demand will be established, and the task for foreign 
trade enterprises to turn their foreign exchange earnings over 
to the state with or without compensation will be abolished, so 
that an environment of fair competition can be created for the 
enterprises. Under effective macroeconomic regulation and 
control, control over the operation of import and export 
commodities will be further relaxed (currently approximately 
2,000 productive enterprises and 100 scientific research 
institutes have already been granted independent import and 
export powers). Legislative work will be strengthened so that 
the cohesion of foreign trade policy and a good operational 
order can be maintained. 
  Second, to enhance the enterprises' sense of earning foreign 
exchange through export and to correctly handle the relations 
between mainly developing a business and the development of a 
diversified economy, between foreign exchange earned through 
export and economic returns, and between independent operation 
and conscientiously maintaining the operational order. All 
departments in charge should give the green light to the 
enterprises for expanding exports and provide them with 
high-quality service. 
  Third, to make great efforts to open up new fields and 
increase exports while consolidating and developing existing 
markets. At present, China has already established economic and 
trade relations with more than 220 countries and regions. An 
initial pluralized market pattern has formed. We still have to 
make greater efforts, however, especially in striving for an 
early return to the status of a GATT signatory state and in 
creating conditions for expanding exports. 
  Moreover, in order to "win by quality," we must continue to 
"fight against sham commodities" next year. We must cooperate 
with the scientific research, production, commodity inspection, 
and customs departments and rely on science and technology, 
policy, and management to greatly increase the quality of our 
export commodities. In border and regional trade, those 
practices that harm the prestige of China's export commodities 
and enterprises should be severely punished according to the law. 
  Judging from China's foreign trade development in the first 
11 months of this year, it is estimated that the total export 
volume for the entire year will exceed $92 billion, and the 
total import volume will reach more than $100 billion. 
Calculated on the basis that the growth rate of import and 
export trade is a bit higher than that of the national economy, 
the total volume of China's foreign trade and the import and 
export volume will reach $200 billion, which will mean a new and 
higher stage, of which imports and exports will each reach $100 
billion. In foreign trade and import and export activities, 
there will possibly be less restrictive factors next year than 
there were this year. The growth in foreign trade, especially 
the increase in the state's foreign exchange earnings, and the 
increase of the state's ability in international payment will be 
conducive to the comprehensive development of China's foreign 
trade and economic cooperation. 
  But what merits our attention is that the growth rate for 
our 
export trade next year has been set at 8.7 percent, which is 
lower than the GNP's growth rate--9 percent. That is why I have 
said that we must make continuous efforts and strive to make the 
growth rate of export trade same as or a bit higher than GNP 
growth rate. 
  [Gong] Some people have asked even though a deficit has 
appeared in China's foreign trade, the number of antidumping 
complaints against China's export goods has nevertheless 
continued to increase. What on earth has actually happened? 
Will this affect China's export trade? 
  [Wu] At present, some countries are faced with economic 
depression, stagnation in domestic industrial production, and a 
situation in which imports can hardly be controlled by the 
original tariff barriers. This, compounded with a lack of 
understanding about China's socialist market economic structure, 
has led these countries to adopt some discriminatory measures 
against Chinese products and regard the antidumping measure as a 
way to prevent foreign commodities from entering their domestic 
markets. We do not like to see this phenomenon. Some countries 
still regard our country as a country with a planned economy 
which still practices the old method of substitute states. This 
is unwarranted today. 
  We are in favor of promoting exports in accordance with 
standard international trade practices. China is a developing 
country. It does not have the economic strength necessary to 
dump its commodities overseas. Because of the relatively cheap 
labor and low production costs in our country, the prices of our 
export commodities are relatively low. We hope that the 
governments and industrial and commercial circles of the 
relevant countries will take a realistic attitude toward the 
selling prices of China's export commodities.

Regulations Governing the Selection and Assessment of Accounting 
Personnel Stationed in Counseling Offices Abroad"--promulgated 
by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5 
October 1993"] 
  [Text] The regulations are drawn up with a view to 
strengthening the financial management and bookkeeping 
operations in economic counseling offices, commercial counseling 
offices, and economic and commercial representative offices 
(economic [commercial] counseling offices for short hereafter) 
abroad, enhancing their level of management, specifying the 
responsibility scope of their accounting personnel, and ensuring 
that all accounting personnel sent to economic (commercial) 
counseling offices abroad are well qualified for their jobs and 
can fulfill their work tasks satisfactorily. 
<H5>  I. Selection of Accounting Personnel </H5>
  1. Principles governing selection. 
  A) All economic (commercial) counseling offices involved in 
foreign economic aid programs and enjoying diplomatic funding 
should select and detail professional accounting personnel who 
have certain work experience in the accounting field. All 
economic (commercial) counseling offices enjoying diplomatic 
funding only should detail professional or part-time accounting 
personnel (i.e. concurrent posts taken by personnel of other 
professions or by people outside the authorized personnel quota) 
according to their own conditions. 
  B) Professional accounting personnel should be familiar 
with, and have a good mastery of, the financial accounting 
system as well as the financial system in Chinese embassies 
(consulates) and acquire knowledge of the financial accounting 
operation of foreign contracted labor services. Part-time 
accounting personnel should have a good mastery of the financial 
accounting system of Chinese embassies (consulates). 
  C) Professional accounting personnel should be selected from 
among the professional financial accounting personnel in 
relevant units and departments, such as the Financial Accounting 
Department, the Administrative Department, and multifaceted 
companies [cheng tao gong si 2052 1152 0361 0674] under this 
ministry; part-time accounting personnel should have the 
educational qualifications of technical secondary school, high 
school, or above. 
  2. Selection methods. 
  A) Candidates selected by the Personnel Department in 
accordance with the above principle will be assigned to the 
financial sections of the Administration Department and 
multifaceted companies to become familiar with relevant 
financial accounting operations. They should take an exam on 
accounting operations according to relevant stipulations and the 
Personnel Department will be notified of their exam results. 
All those passing the exam can immediately go through the 
necessary exit formalities, while those who fail the exam should 
not be sent abroad as accounting personnel. 
  B) All professional accounting personnel who have worked as 
accounting personnel in economic (commercial) counseling offices 
and are competent can be exempted from taking the exam. The 
Financial Accounting Department will sponsor irregular training 
courses on the financial accounting operations of economic 
(commercial) counseling offices. Those who can obtain the 
completion certificate from the training course are also exempt 
from taking the exam when sent abroad. 
<H5>  II. Tasks of Accounting Personnel </H5>
  1. Observe, publicize, and implement relevant policies, 
decrees and orders, stipulations, and financial and economic 
disciplines of the state. 
  2. In accordance with the stipulations of the financial 
accounting system concerning foreign economic aid, manage the 
funds and properties of foreign economic aid programs; take 
charge of the settlement of local costs and contract purchase 
price of projects under the economic aid contracted 
responsibility system; and keep, work out, and submit accounts 
of economic activities already incurred in a timely fashion. 
  3. In line with the stipulations of the financial accounting 
system of Chinese embassies (consulates), manage the diplomatic 
funds and properties of economic (commercial) counseling 
offices; and keep, work out, and submit accounts of economic 
activities already incurred in a timely fashion. 
  4. Supervise and check the financial revenue and expenditure 
of projects under the economic aid contracted responsibility 
system and find out and reflect problems to higher levels in a 
timely manner. 
  5. Acquire knowledge about the overseas-based financial 
accounting operations in representative offices, contracted 
projects, labor cooperations, and joint ventures of various 
international economic and technical cooperative companies; 
provide them with relevant information about the country in 
which they function; relay and supervise the implementation of 
relevant internal documents and systems; and give assistance to 
work in this aspect. 
  6. Conduct frequent investigations into and studies of the 
financial accounting system, foreign exchange management, 
taxation rules, operation of banking institutions, and financial 
markets in the resident country, and send investigation and 
research data back to the relevant departments at home without 
delay. 
  7. Take good care of accounting records. An accounting 
archive should be set up in line with relevant stipulations to 
classify, codify, and bind accounting vouchers, books, and 
various fiscal statements; specify the period for safe custody; 
and assign special people to take charge of records management. 
  8. Do a good job in the handover of accounts. Before 
their departure from economic (commercial) counseling offices 
due to job transfer, accounting personnel should go through 
handing over procedures with their successors in the resident 
county. A handover inventory should be signed by the two 
parties concerned and an overseer of the handover. It is 
imperative to make a detailed inventory of fixed assets, reserve 
materials, and cash in the treasury and ensure that there is 
neither discrepancy between accounts and actual resources nor 
disagreement between accounts. As regards temporary credit and 
debit, detailed account statements should be worked out by unit 
or by an individual and handed over with the proper endorsement 
of the units and individuals concerned. A "Statement on the 
Balance of Bank Deposits" should be prepared to ensure the 
accuracy of the deposited amount. 
<H3>  III. Supervision, Examination, and Leadership Over 
Accounting Work </H3>
  1. Relevant departments, including the Financial Accounting 
Department, the Administration Department, and multifaceted 
companies, should organize, in a planned way, accounting work 
inspection groups and call meetings on overseas-based accounting 
work every year; check and give guidance to the financial 
accounting work of relevant economic (commercial) counseling 
offices; and hold lectures and tuitions on relevant financial 
accounting operations to help accounting personnel deal with 
certain problems and enhance the level of financial accounting 
work. 
  2. As regards those economic (commercial) counseling offices 
which are plagued by a relatively larger number of problems, the 
ministry's Financial Accounting Department should work with the 
relevant departments, organize a special work group, conduct a 
comprehensive examination of the situation, and help solve 
existing problems. The work group can also make suggestions to 
the Personnel Department on the dismissal of truly incompetent 
accounting personnel working in economic (commercial) counseling 
offices. 
  3. Leading comrades of all economic (commercial) counseling 
offices stationed abroad should strengthen their leadership over 
the financial accounting work of their own offices, take the 
lead in observing financial and economic discipline, support 
financial accounting personnel to handle matters impartially, 
and conduct regular supervision and examinations on the 
financial accounting work of their own offices. 
  4. Accounting personnel who are on holiday back home should 
go and report their work to the ministry's Financial Accounting 
Department and the financial sections of the Administration 
Department and multifaceted companies at a prearranged time. 
Meanwhile, the Financial Accounting Department and the financial 
sections of the Administration Department and multifaceted 
companies will brief the accounting personnel on newly 
promulgated financial accounting systems and offer explanations 
and answers to relevant questions. 
<H5>  IV. Supplementary provisions </H5>
  These Regulations shall come into force on 1 June 1990.

  [Text] Recently, many localities have sought approval for 
projects which use foreign funds to import waste metals for 
processing and reexport. In light of the fact that such 
projects do not fall under the domain in which the state 
encourages foreign investment, the wide area covered by the 
projects, and their complicated nature and in order to properly 
guide the flow of foreign capital so that it can help national 
economic development, such projects must be subject to strict 
scrutiny before approval can be granted, and management must be 
strengthened. Henceforth, it will not be suitable to grant any 
more approvals for the establishment of joint-venture and 
cooperative projects that involve the simple dismantling of 
metals and determine which are useful for reexport or for the 
establishment of foreign-funded enterprises (solely owned 
enterprises) that engage in the processing of waste metals. 
Various economic and trade commissions (offices and bureaus) 
should maintain strict standards in the examination and approval 
work.

`Explanation' of `Circular on Adding Share Transfer Clauses to 
Contracts on U.S. Investment in China'"--(Promulgated by the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5 October 
1993)"] 
  [Text] This ministry has already issued the "Circular on 
Adding 'Share Transfer' Clauses to Contracts on U.S. Investment 
in China." The answers to some questions are as follows: 
  1. The standard clauses on "share transfer" (in Chinese and 
English) issued together with the circular were formulated, 
after negotiations, by the Treaty and Law Department of the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the U.S. 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) on the basis of 
the Sino-U.S. Investment and Guarantee Agreement signed in 1980. 
Such standard clauses can be included into contracts for 
Sino-U.S. joint ventures or cooperative enterprises. 
  2. According to the agreement, if a U.S. investor has 
insured a certain investment project in China with OPIC, and if 
OPIC has paid indemnity to the investor in case a political risk 
occurs, the Chinese Government will acknowledge the rights and 
obligations included in the investment contract of the U.S. 
investor will be automatically transferred to OPIC; that is, 
OPIC will have the right to demand indemnity instead of the 
investor. However, it is not necessary to write this in 
contracts for Sino-U.S. joint ventures or cooperative 
enterprises. 
  3. These "share transfer clauses" are only applicable to 
investment projects insured with OPIC. Such a transfer need not 
have the agreement of the Chinese side in a joint venture. Nor 
is it necessary for examination and approval organs to approve. 
This seems to be contradictory to Article 23 of "Provisions for 
the Implementation of the Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law," but 
it conforms with the legal principles of China; that is, if an 
international treaty (including bilateral and multilateral) 
involving a contract is concluded or joined in China, but it 
contains stipulations different from those of the laws in China, 
the provisions of the treaty are applicable. 
  4. If any other problem emerges in the course of 
implementation, please report in good time to the (Treaty and 
Law Department) of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
and Trade. [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and 
Trade [Dated] 2 November 1989

<F P=106> ["Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Circular </F>
on "Legal Issues Cropping Up in the Course of Running 
Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures"--promulgated by the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5 October 1993] 
  [Text] Since the promulgation and implementation of the 
"Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law and its regulations for 
implementation, China has approved 3,986 Sino-foreign joint 
ventures (up to the end of September 1987). The following 
circular on several legal issues which often crop up in the 
course of running Sino-foreign joint ventures in various 
localities is now issued: 
  1. Concerning replacement of approval certificates. 
  Sino-foreign joint ventures, in the course of carrying out 
contracts, often have to change the addresses of the joint 
ventures, the parties in the joint ventures, the total amount of 
investment, the business scope, the formation of the boards of 
directors and changes in the chairmen and vice chairmen of these 
boards, and changes involving the contents of approved 
agreements, contracts, rules, and approval certificates which 
have already been issued. Article 17 of the "Regulations for 
Implementing the Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law" stipulates: 
"Agreements, contracts, and rules for joint ventures come into 
effect on approval by examination and approval organs and the 
same holds true in the case of alterations." Therefore, all 
changes in the major contents of agreements, contracts, and 
rules for joint ventures should be approved by the original 
organs for examination and approval. Upon approval, new 
approval certificates will be issued with the same serial 
numbers as the original approval certificates and the old 
approval certificates will be taken back. Changes in 
registration will be made against the approval certificates at 
the original registration organs. 
  2. Concerning the issue of not allowing general managers or 
deputy general managers of Sino-foreign joint ventures to take 
up concurrent posts as general managers or deputy general 
managers of other economic organizations. 
  Article 40 of the "Regulations for the Implementation of 
Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law" stipulates: "General managers 
or deputy general managers will not take up concurrent posts as 
general managers or deputy general managers of other economic 
organizations and will not take part in commercial competition 
for other economic organizations against the joint ventures." 
At present, the general managers of the foreign sides of some 
Sino-foreign joint ventures have concurrent posts as general 
managers or other posts in enterprises outside the bordera. 
This violates the laws in China and should be stopped. The 
"other economic organizations" stated in the provision include 
both economic organizations at home and abroad. 
  3. Concerning the limits of authority for examination and 
approval of increasing investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures. 
  If an approved Sino-foreign joint venture wants to increase 
investment because of the needs in production, operation, and so 
on, and if the sum of the amount of investment to be increased 
and the amount of the original investment exceeds the limits of 
authority for examination and approval of the original organ of 
examination and approval and the expanded part is within the 
same project, the newly signed agreement on increasing 
investment should, together with the originally approved 
documents, be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and Trade for examination and approval. 
  The abovementioned matters regarding approved Sino-foreign 
joint ventures and foreign trade enterprises should be handled 
according to the abovementioned principles. [Signed] Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [Dated] 17 December 1987

"Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Announces a 
Circular Formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and Trade on the Strict Examination, Approval, and 
Issuance of Import and Export Licenses to Foreign-Invested 
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Based on the relevant State Council regulations and 
in order to further improve and strengthen the management of 
applications for import and export licenses filed by 
foreign-funded enterprises, the relevant regulations have been 
clarified as follows: 
  1. When examining and approving the establishment of 
foreign-funded enterprises and compensatory trade projects, 
matters relating to the licenses for importing raw materials and 
spare parts and for exporting products, including the increase 
or decrease in the number of the originally approved licenses 
due to the expansion of operational domains by enterprises and 
goods requiring one-time export licenses should be reported in 
the form of official documents by the economic and trade bureaus 
of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and 
cities listed separately for development to the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], which will 
examine them and give official replies in the form of ministry 
documents. 
  2. Within the number of licenses permitted by the official 
replies from MOFERT, if the products produced by the enterprises 
themselves meet the stipulations of the replies, the 
license-issuing departments should issue licenses according to 
the reply documents. No license should be issued to an 
enterprise which does not have the MOFERT document or a letter 
permitting a license. Various license-issuing units should 
observe strict examination and inspection. 
  3. It is hereby reiterated that foreign-funded enterprises 
are not permitted to purchase products for export without 
authorization, and, if such a situation is discovered, it will 
be handled as an illegal operation. If an enterprise needs to 
purchase products for export in order to strike a balance 
between foreign exchange income and expenditures, it should go 
through the reporting and approval formalities according to the 
relevant regulations of the country.

Formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and

  [Text] In recent years, the number of enterprises filing 
applications for utilizing foreign capital to run 
tire-retreading projects has increased, and a very large 
quantity of old tires are awaiting permission to be imported. 
According to preliminary statistics provided by a relevant 
department, there are 515 within-plan enterprises at fixed 
locations throughout the country specializing in retreading 
tires, and they can retread 5.74 million tires every year. They 
produced approximately 2.1 million retreads in 1986, only 
utilizing 37 percent of the capacity. The country can currently 
produce 17.62 million sets of new tires every year, while the 
actual need is only 15 million sets, so supply is greater than 
demand. 
  In light of the above-mentioned situation, we are asking the 
various departments to please observe strict rules. Except for 
the enterprises that export all the retreads, from now on, 
generally approval should not be granted to the establishment of 
Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises and cooperative projects 
engaging in tire retreading, and jointly run enterprises that 
current exist should not be granted approval to expand their 
scales of operation and capacity. If a project is truly 
designed to achieve technological transformation, approval 
should be granted after the project has been reported to the 
relevant economic, trade, and commercial departments for 
examination and their approval has been secured.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China is considering 
the possibilities of allowing more overseas insurance companies 
to set up branches in coastal areas and special economic zones, 
official sources disclosed here today. 
  Under the plan, which has yet to be ratified by the State 
Council, overseas firms would be permitted to operate 
foreign-related insurance business in China. But they can only 
settle their accounts in foreign currencies. 
  The move represents China's bid to meet the challenge of 
restoring the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as 
well as an endeavor to broaden international cooperation in the 
areas of insurance, a relatively weak sector in the country. 
  However, China will be cautious about the step. It would be 
a gradual process, the sources said, adding that conditions are 
not yet ripe for a large-scale opening up. 
  Some restrictions are expected with regard to branches to be 
established in China, the sources said, without giving further 
details. 
  Experts here said that opening up China's insurance sector 
will not only boost the country's insurance business, but help 
garner more foreign funds. 
  With a population of about 1.2 billion, China is a huge 
insurance market in the eyes of many foreign investors. In 
fact, more than 30 foreign insurance companies have set up 
representative offices and agencies in China so far, the 
majority of which are offering consulting services or acting as 
agents. 
  Over the years, the People's Insurance Company of China 
(PICC), China's flag-carrier in this field, has established good 
business ties with insurance firms in almost all countries and 
regions, according to Shi Guoqing, deputy general manager of 
PICC's International Department. 
  In line with the basic principle of "equality and mutual 
benefit" embodied in GATT, China will be given the opportunity 
of entering the international insurance market, while opening up 
its own. 
  PICC, which monopolises more than 90 percent of the 
country's 
total insurance business, is currently accelerating the pace for 
developing overseas insurance business. 
  China-funded insurance agencies are now scattered in Hong 
Kong, Macao, Singapore, Britain, the U.S., Germany and 
Luxembourg. They can conduct businesses such as property 
insurance, life insurance, re-insurance and in the fields of 
investment and securities. 
  The number of such agencies has risen to 71. A total of 
1,000 employees are working in the agencies, which witnessed a 
general insurance premium income of about 230 million U.S. 
dollars last year. 
  The Hong Kong Chinese Insurance Group Company (CIG), which 
was opened last year, has captured about 20 percent of the total 
business in Hong Kong insurance market. The Hong Kong Minan 
Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CIG, ranked first in the same 
trade in Hong Kong for its large premium income. 
  China-funded insurance companies in Macao also hold as much 
as 40 percent of the market. 
  As mentioned by Shi Guoqing, beside successfully organizing 
the CIG and European China Holdings Company last year, China 
will take a bolder step to set up regional management companies 
in Southeast Asia and in North America in the near future. 
  Then the country will try to knit a world-wide insurance 
network, so as to make China's insurance business more 
competitive on the world market. 
  Shi Guoqing said that there was a broad prospect for China 
to 
develop overseas insurance business, as the world market is a 
sizable one. Statistics show that the world's yearly premium 
income is about 1,400 billion U.S. dollars. 
  In the meantime, the PICC has also done well in developing 
foreign-related insurance business, which has contributed a lot 
to foreign trade, and improving the investment environment. 
  Last year, premium income for foreign-related insurance 
business achieved more than 700 million U.S. dollars, up 30 
percent over the previous year. 
  PICC has now opened 80-plus insurance items for 
foreign-related business, which include off-shore petroleum 
drilling, satellite-launching and construction of nuclear power 
plants.

  [Text] Xining, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The number of 
foreign-funded enterprises in China had come to 150,000 by the 
end of 1993, with the total contract foreign investment topping 
200 billion U.S. dollars. 
  This was revealed during a recent visit to Xining by Liu 
Zhicheng, vice-president of the China Association of Enterprises 
Using Foreign Investment. 
  China's foreign-funded enterprises already in operation have 
reached 50,000 nationwide and created an export trade volume of 
16 billion U.S. dollars-worth from January to September last 
year, accounting for 26 percent of the country's total. 
  Liu said a marked increase occurred in the number of 
investing countries and regions. 
  Among the investors from 117 countries and regions, those 
from Hong Kong and Macao are still holding the first place in 
number and the amount of investment. 
  Investment in China from Taiwan, the United States, Japan 
and 
Singapore have also seen a rapid growth last year. 
  In 1993, more foreign investment was poured into the 
interior 
areas than the coastal regions of the country for the first 
time, mainly due to the operation of the Eurasian Continental 
Bridge which can greatly reduce transport distance, time and 
costs from Asia to Europe, compared with marine transport. 
  The range of overseas investment has also been expanded from 
the solely manufacturing industry to such fields as real 
estate, finance, insurance, accounting and infrastructure 
constructions. 
  Along with the booming of enterprises with foreign 
investment, associations of these enterprises have been 
established in most provinces and regions in China, with the aim 
of providing services to and protect the interests of the 
foreign-funded firms and to play the role of a bridge between 
them and local governments.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS)--Since the establishment 
of an insurance system for unemployed people in 1986, China has 
distributed relief funds to 1.2 million such people, most of 
whom have now found jobs, an official of the Ministry of Labour 
said at a national work meeting of the People's Insurance 
Company of China held here today. 
  According to statistics by the Ministry of Labour, the 
number 
of unemployed receiving unemployment relief between January and 
October last year were more than 700,000, more than the total 
for the previous seven years after the establishment of the 
unemployment insurance system. 
  The official of the Ministry of Labour said that the reason 
for this increase in numbers last year was due to the widening 
of the range of people receiving such relief and the increasing 
number of people leaving their former employment. 
  Up until now, 70.4 million workers from 470,000 state-owned 
entities have taken part in the unemployment insurance scheme as 
have also workers in collectively owned enterprises in some 
places. 
  According to the scheme on reform of social insurance worked 
out by relevant departments, unemployment insurance will 
gradually cover all kinds of labourers in cities and towns in 
the country. At present, the unemployment insurance funds and 
the insurance mechanism for the unemployed must be brought into 
full utilization and the activities of job-training, 
job-introduction and the issuance of relief for production must 
be carried out in an active way. The basic rights and interests 
of workers must be guaranteed in the process of reform.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA correspondent Zhang Jinsheng (1728 </F>
6930 0524): "1994 is a Crucial Year for China's Reform"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- China's reform of its 
economic system will face many climaxes in 1994. It will be a 
crucial year for China to comprehensively promote the economic 
reform system and to make major breakthroughs in this regard. 
If we consider reform in the 1980's mainly as dismantling the 
old system -- or "demolishing old houses" -- then the main task 
in the next-phase of reform will be establishing a new system, 
or "constructing new buildings." Our current reform has begun 
to deepen, shifting our focus from single items to comprehensive 
and coordinated projects. We have shifted our attention to 
establishing totally new economic relations in an all-round 
manner rather than focusing on obtaining benefits from 
relatively independent reform measures. Deepened reform dictates 
that we have to wage arduous struggles to overcome tough 
problems. 
  What are the major reform tasks facing us in 1994? According 
to the State Economic Restructuring Commission, after a long 
period of deliberation, study, and estimation, China will deepen 
reform in various fields in 1994 and will make breakthroughs in 
this regard. A series of reform programs includes macroeconomic 
reform in taxation, finance, investment, the foreign trade 
system, the enterprise system, social security, the housing 
system, the public servant system, the system of salaries for 
administrative organs and institutions, and prices. There are 
two important points in the many reform tasks: 1) Proceeding 
from changing operating mechanisms in state enterprises, we 
should strive to renovate the enterprise system, and should 
actively explore and seek effective ways to establish a modern 
enterprise system. 2) We should accelerate reform in taxation, 
finance, and the planning and investment systems, and we should 
make key progress in formulating macro-regulatory and 
controlling devices which are compatible with the requirements 
of a market economy. While focusing our efforts on these two 
main points, we should also make concerted efforts and speed up 
the establishment of a market system with essential-factor 
markets as the main form; we should expand and intensify reform 
in the social security and housing system; we should accelerate 
the pace of reform in the management of foreign trade and 
foreign exchanges; and we should actively deepen rural reform. 
  By accomplishing these arduous reform missions, we aim to 
fulfill the following three objectives: 
  -- We aim to establish a modern enterprise system whereby 
the 
requirements of a market economy are fulfilled, property rights 
are specified, rights and duties are defined, government and 
enterprises are separated, and scientific administrative methods 
are enforced. 
  -- While specifically developing essential-factor markets, 
we 
aim to enhance a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market 
system. 
  -- We aim to explore and establish positive and effective 
state macroregulatory and controlling systems and policies, and 
to formulate a set of statistical indicators for the national 
economy and a system of laws and regulations so as to regulate 
the total social demand and supply to remain basically balanced, 
and to optimize the economic structure in an effort to guide the 
national economy to progress in a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
manner. 
  To accomplish these reform missions and fulfill the 
formulated reform objectives, experts from various sectors held 
that we must persistently implement the reform strategies in an 
all-round and coordinated manner. We should not only carry out 
reform as a coordinating component of the entire comprehensive 
design, but should also consider the arrangement of every reform 
measure in conjunction with the overall picture. China's reform 
has entered a phase where we should tackle formidable problems. 
Therefore, while implementing the strategies in an all-round 
and coordinated manner, we should also seize opportunities in 
reform and make major breakthroughs in various crucial links. 
We should make special efforts to carry out certain reforms 
which have crucial effects on transforming old systems into new 
ones, which have a relatively major impact on the overall 
situation, and which have certain adequate conditions. 
Additionally, we should strive to make greater efforts in this 
regard so as to achieve some breakthroughs. We should create 
conditions for those reforms which lack adequate conditions 
temporarily, and should actively enhance these conditions. 
Otherwise we will most probably miss the strategic moment and 
unnecessarily extend the transitional period of establishing a 
new economic system, thereby eventually increasing the risks and 
costs for reform. Responsible comrades of the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission sharply pointed out that extensive 
reform in 1994 is a complex and arduous systematic project. The 
reform will be deep and extensive, involving the readjustment of 
powers and interests in various sectors. To accomplish these 
reform missions, on the one hand we should have confidence in a 
definite victory and should be determined and unwavering so as 
to be definitely victorious at the first fight. On the other 
hand, we should also be adequately prepared psychologically for 
probable difficulties, should uphold scientific designs, should 
carefully conduct operations, and should promptly summarize 
experiences so as to avoid major mistakes. 
  While analyzing favorable conditions for reforming the 
economic system in 1994, economists held that, first, the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has further 
specified the direction and objectives of reform; theories on 
reform have been continually improved. Consequently, a 
favorable political environment has been formed. Second, after 
15 years of reform and opening up, China has accumulated 
abundant reform experience which enables hundreds of millions of 
people to conscientiously join in the great course of reform. 
Reform has become more acceptable in people's concepts, 
resulting in a more favorable social environment and receptive 
public opinion. A gradual rise in the people's living standards 
and their strong urge to seek new systems and new issues have 
strengthened their enduring capacity for reform, thereby 
resulting in a relatively favorable psychological reception. 
After undergoing economic construction for several years and 
rapid economic progress for the past two consecutive years, 
China has considerably increased its comprehensive national 
strength and has accumulated a certain level of material goods. 
A strong domestic demand for investments and a steady but 
rising demand for consumer goods have provided a relatively 
strong "driving force for internal demand" for reform. All 
these factors have contributed to a conducive economic 
environment. 
  We are in a new historic era of reform. The establishment of 
a socialist market economy, an unprecedented great event in the 
history of mankind, requires that we properly perform this task 
with unprecedented courage. That is why we said the year 1994 
will be a glorious year for China's reform and opening up, and 
will also be a year for China to make more leaps and bounds in 
its economy.

<F P=106> ["Year-end Economic Commentary" by Wu Jincai (0702 6930 </F>
2088): "Market-Orientation -- New Challenge for State-Owned 
Enterprises in the New Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- At the end of the year, 
large- and medium-sized enterprises are faced with the severe 
test of how to gear themselves towards the market in 1994. In 
the coming year, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises 
can occupy a favorable position in the overall economic 
situation only by continuing their efforts to gear towards the 
market and to readjust the industrial structure and product mix 
in accordance with the market's needs . 
  The year 1993 witnessed strong growth in China's industry 
and 
economy. But problems in economic performance did not show a 
marked turn for the better. Where do the problems stem from? 
Many personages in economic circles believe the fundamental 
reason for the low economic performance of China's many 
"quick-profit" enterprises lies in the enterprises themselves. 
Take enterprise funds as an example. An outstanding problem is 
long-term expansion of fixed asset investment, which results in 
excessive input for enlarged reproduction taking the place of 
the need for simple reproduction. Since 1993 -- the second half 
of the year in particular -- China's banks have done a great 
deal of work and have achieved marked results in providing funds 
on a priority basis to meet the needs of key large- and 
medium-sized enterprises in production. But an excessive fixed 
asset investment scale, over-rapid growth rates in industrial 
production, and decreasing product sales rates are still 
fundamental reasons for the shortage of funds for enterprises. 
This thorny problem, which continually troubled us in the 
1980's, is still worthy of our concern. Judging from some 
circumstances in 1993, phenomena began to arise again -- such as 
some enterprises failing to organize production in accordance 
with market demand, having no ready markets to sell their 
products, having poor transportation conditions to ship 
products, and defaulting on commodity payments -- which caused 
enterprises to overspend their three kinds of funds [funds 
occupied by ready commodities of state-owned enterprises, funds 
on commodities which have been shipped from factories, and funds 
from receivable and prepaid accounts], therefore stifling the 
circulation of large amounts of funds. In some localities, 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises experienced 
increasing losses. They used bank loans for other purposes; they 
found it difficult to replenish their circulating funds. Such 
overt and covert losses also caused losses in funds. 
  When we analyze the situation of enterprises on the basis of 
these causes, we cannot help reexamining the old issue that our 
enterprises must speed up the restructuring of their industrial 
operations as well as their product mix. This is because 
shortages of working funds caused by piling up of unsold goods 
has been a longstanding problem, the solution of which lies in 
studying market changes; in readjusting the product mix and 
output according to market needs; and in carrying out projects 
to curb production, reduce stockpiles, and promote sales. In 
this sense, it is still strongly realistic for us to stress 
every year, every month, and even every day that our enterprises 
must work hard to achieve higher economic returns through 
improving their management and operations. According to 
personnel within financial circles, under the credit policy of 
"giving preferential treatment to five types of business, 
tightening funds for five other types of business, and never 
lending money to eight types of operations," they will continue 
to ensure that working funds and funds for upgrading technology 
will be available for those profitable enterprises producing 
marketable goods. We must use financial pressures to force 
unprofitable enterprises to speed up dealing with their losses. 
  Deficits by state enterprises are a problem which has never 
been effectively resolved, and it is obstructing normal economic 
operations. The national economy as a whole cannot possibly be 
revitalized unless the burdens created by growing deficits and 
by increasingly larger numbers of unprofitable enterprises can 
be cast off. Statistics show the deficits incurred by the 
nation's industrial enterprises which conduct business 
accounting independently totalled 44.157 billion yuan in 1992, 
and the problem was even worse for industrial enterprises whose 
accounting was part of the state budget. People certainly will 
pay closer attention to this problem in 1994. The experiences 
gained by some formerly deficit-ridden enterprises show that to 
deal with this problem, enterprises must find their own ways to 
gain market access through reform. 
  In terms of the principle for developing a socialist market 
economy, the problem of unprofitable enterprises must be 
resolved through competition in the market where poorly operated 
businesses will be replaced by efficiently managed businesses, 
and resources in society will be rationally distributed. 
However, in real economic life many state enterprises are still 
alive and insolvent enterprises still manage to function only 
because they have local government protection and "blood 
transfusions" from banks. This being the case, we must find a 
way out for these enterprises, beginning with distributing 
resources rationally through the market. Under the market 
economic system, all enterprises must go through a test in which 
the poorly operated businesses will be edged out by their 
efficiently operated counterparts. Deficit-ridden enterprises 
in particular must rely on themselves to upgrade their 
technology, improve their management, and develop popular goods 
which the market needs. Those enterprises unable to reverse 
their deficit status will no longer have government protection, 
and they should no longer be kept alive with "blood 
transfusions" from the government or from banks. 
  While the magnitude of problems encountered by state 
enterprises is unprecedented, the strategic role played by state 
enterprises cannot be shaken owing to China's economic 
realities. During the course of building a new, socialist 
market economic system, the need to build a modern, 
scientifically managed enterprise system -- which is in line 
with requirements of the market economy, which clearly outlines 
property rights and responsibilities, and which separates 
enterprise operations from government control -- has been placed 
on the agenda; enterprises must make new moves toward operating 
themselves autonomously, assuming sole responsibility for 
profits and losses, seeking development on their own, and 
exercising self-restraint. Next year China will introduce a 
series of measures governing reforms in planning, investment, 
banking, financial operations, foreign trade, and social 
security. These measures will create an environment favorable 
for large and medium-sized state enterprises to improve their 
operations. This will be a new starting point for state 
enterprises to move toward a market economy. How to adapt 
themselves to market mechanisms and generate profits and wealth 
from various angles and at all levels will be a new challenge 
for large and medium-sized state enterprise during 1994.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS)--The Bank of China, a 
professional bank specializing in foreign exchange in China, 
will gradually shift from being a state-owned professional bank 
into a state-operated commercial bank centering on the building 
up of an internal management system employing self-discipline. 
This was made public by chairman of the board of directors of 
the bank, Mr. Wang Qiren, at a meeting of heads of branches of 
the bank across the country. 
  Mr. Wang gave details of the reform including first, the 
establishment of an internal management mechanism for capital in 
renminbi featuring unified regulation and control as well as 
clear classification of responsibility. The aim is to set up a 
sound capital management mechanism. 
  Second, the practice of ratio of assets to liabilities and 
risk management of assets will be carried out within a specific 
scope of loan volume. Application of capital will be subject to 
capital source which will also govern the time limit for assets 
and liabilities, a sound interest rate structure, the bettering 
of assets, and diversification of risk. An auditing system will 
be worked out and improved, thereby formulating an effective 
self-discipline mechanism. 
  Third, policy-oriented finance must be separated from 
commerce-oriented finance while attention will be paid to the 
good coordination of business operation in the course of the 
change in the system as well as when a policy-oriented bank is 
set up. This is aimed at avoiding any adverse effects on 
economic development resulting from some operations deviating 
from the reform process. Economic results and risk must be given 
serious consideration when policy-oriented credit business is 
undertaken. 
  Fourth, a certain amount of credit allocated from within the 
system will be used for the purchase of national treasury bonds 
and for financial debt held by the policy-oriented bank while at 
the same time it will also be put into the money market.

<F P=106> [Report from the "Opinion" page on an interview with Lin </F>
Yifu, an economist with the State Council Development and 
Research Centre, by CHINA DAILY reporter Fu Jian; place and date 
not given: "Fair Competition the Only Way To Ensure Efficiency"] 
  [Text] Having been in existence for more than 10 years, 
China's enterprise reforms still need to be improved. 
  Today's enterprise system--consisting mainly of shareholding 
corporations--is seen as a good way to invigorate enterprises 
and reform most of the country's large and medium-sized 
State-owned enterprises. 
  But according to Lin Yifu, an economist with the Development 
and Research Centre of the State Council, a modern corporate 
system is not enough to ensure enterprise inefficiency. 
  "Fair competition is the most important factor in improving 
enterprise efficiency, no matter what system is adopted," Lin 
said in an interview with China Daily. 
  "Many shareholding corporations in developed countries run 
badly or even go bankrupt, while many State-owned enterprises, 
such as Singapore Airlines and the Regie Nationale des Usines 
Renault, are well operated," Lin said. 
  In both shareholding corporations and these State-owned 
enterprises, management and ownership is separate. 
<H5>  Profits </H5>
  Managers of shareholding corporations, who receive salaries 
but not stock bonuses, might be more concerned with increasing 
their own income than earning more profits for shareholders. 
Managers of State-owned enterprises might have a similar 
intention. 
  Some of them might even sacrifice enterprise benefits for 
higher personal incomes. 
  It is also impossible for shareholders (or the State) to 
closely monitor managers daily. 
  This problem can only be solved through market competition, 
Lin said. 
  Market competition will force managers to be faithful and 
diligent, lest they lose money. 
  Owners of poorly run enterprises (shareholders or the State) 
will fire managers and appoint more competent people. 
  For Chinese enterprises, competition has not been fair, Lin 
said, since reforms on prices, interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates have lagged behind enterprise reform. These 
levers are still controlled by the State as well. 
  Thus enterprises are still heavily affected by set prices 
and 
government interference in the market place. 
  China began enterprise reform so as to give enterprises more 
decision-making power and a larger share of profits. The 
measures were efficient in the short term, but in the long-term 
they do not address the heart of the problem. 
  Currently about two-thirds of State-owned enterprises are 
running at a loss. 
  What's more serious, State-owned firms have lost money 
because of high salaries and welfare payments to managers and 
employees. 
  The government has had difficulty in stopping this not only 
because of enterprises' enlarged power, but also because of a 
lack of self-restraint and appropriate supervision mechanisms, 
Lin said. 
  Even if enterprises are transformed into shareholding 
corporations, these practices may continue if firms are still 
kept afloat by the State and not forced to deal with the threat 
of bankruptcy. 
  Moreover, State-owned assets may still be siphoned off 
unless 
firms are forced to deal with market forces. 
  To force enterprises to exercise self-restraint and become 
more efficient, they must be left to survive on their own in the 
market economy, Lin said. 
  Furthermore he said, reforms in finance, taxation and the 
banking system should be carried out. 
  Since the Party's Third Plenary Session of the 14th National 
Congress last October, such reforms have been strengthened. 
  And it is expected huge steps will be made in these reforms 
this year. 
<H5>  Labour </H5>
  Since China is short of capital but has an abundant labour 
force, labour-intensive light industries can survive and develop 
more easily than heavy industry. 
  So Lin said that the government should put less control on 
prices to guarantee funds needed for development. 
  The development of light industries can also accumulate 
funds 
to help develop heavy industry. 
  Thus, China should put more emphasis on the development of 
light industry and cut the number of firms in heavy industry, 
Lin said. 
  As for existing heavy industrial enterprises, large- and 
medium-sized ones that are vital to the country's economy should 
be maintained while small ones can be sold or leased to 
individuals, or merged with other enterprises. 
  The enterprises that are kept--many of which are incapable 
of 
surviving on their own--should be supported by the State. 
  To prevent additional losses, a responsibility system could 
be adopted, Lin said. 
  Firms should be given a certain amount of leeway, but if 
their losses are too great the State should fine or fire the 
managers. 
  Enterprises with good performances should be rewarded and 
allowed to retain their profits. 
  With the development of light industry and the service 
sector, the demand for heavy industry commodities will increase. 
The country's capital will become more abundant and enterprises 
will be able to become autonomous and survive without government 
support.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sun Shangqing, head of the State Council </F>
Development Research Center, by staff reporter Xiao Rui (5618 
3843): "Anti-Inflation Measures Should Be an Important Aspect of 
the Macroeconomic Policies for 1994"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At an 
interview with our staff reporter, Sun Shangqing, head of the 
State Council Development Research Center, pointed out: The 
year 1994 will be critical for China's economic development, 
reform, and opening up. In order to ensure the smooth 
implementation of a number of important reform proposals and 
sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 
4958 1816 6643 1696 1660] development of the economy, the 
macroeconomic policies should focus on countering inflation. 
  As an economic expert in close contact with decisionmakers, 
Sun Shangqing studied national economic performance and trends 
toward the end of 1992 and recommended that the macroeconomic 
management for 1993 should focus on preventing economic 
overheating. This assessment later commanded much attention 
from various quarters. 
  Sun Shangqing believed that China's economy has entered a 
stage of rapid growth. The growth rate in 1994 will remain 
high, and any attempt to keep the growth rate unnaturally low 
will cause major fluctuations that will undermine national 
economic development. Considering that growth in 1994 will be 
based on the high rates of 1992 and 1993, it is appropriate to 
set the target growth rate at 9 percent. 
  He said: We have a weak economic base. Speedy development 
is bound to create tension in various economic relationships and 
put a strain on energy, communication, important raw materials, 
currency, and financial expenditures. Under such circumstances, 
the important reform measures to be promulgated this year will 
probably all cause some shocks and lead to instability in the 
economy. Therefore, one should be both optimistic and cautious 
when analyzing the economic situation. It is necessary to fully 
consider the risks in the course of reform and prepare for 
possible trouble. 
  Sun Shangqing pointed out: The most critical risk is 
probably inflation. China's economy is still quite vulnerable, 
as is the mentality of the general public. Development is 
unbalanced in different localities, and there are major 
discrepancies when it comes to personal incomes. We should be 
soberly aware of these facts and should not overestimate the 
society's threshold of tolerance for inflation. In 1993, the 
general retail price index went up 13 percent, and the cost of 
living in 35 large and medium cities increased by 20 percent. 
This "tailspin [qiao wei 5062 1442]" has constituted a great 
source of pressure this year. Therefore, special precautions 
should be taken against a possible increase in the inflation 
rate caused by the persistently large investment in fixed 
assets, the unification of exchange rates, and the price hikes 
of some energy and agricultural products, and efforts must be 
made to keep the inflation rate under 10 percent and prevent 
stagflation. 
  Sun Shangqing maintained that what is important for 1994 is 
to properly handle the relationship between reform and 
development and that between speed and efficiency. 
Macroeconomic policies must be directed to specific issues, and 
the central bank must effectively control the money supply. The 
management of the national economy must achieve the following 
two changes: 
  First, the quota supply system that used to be based on rare 
resources should be changed, and the predominance of 
supply-based management should be converted to demand-based 
management. On a microeconomic scale, production should be 
arranged according to market demand; on the macroeconomic scale, 
it is necessary to keep a close watch on overall demand trends 
and the demand structure. 
  Second, attention should be given to the improvement of 
economic efficiency. It is necessary to seek the qualitative 
improvement and quantitative growth of the national economy in 
the context of optimized economic structure and overcome the 
tendency to place excessive emphasis on speed.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Learn From Persons of Outstanding </F>
Ability, Protect Persons of Outstanding Ability"] 
  [Text] The deeds of Comrade Chen Wensong, former Dalian 
Shipyard director are heartbreaking and reveal the brilliant 
features of a contemporary entrepreneur who was a Communist. 
  As a Communist, Chen Wensong always bore in mind the lofty 
responsibility and mission on his shoulders. He said: "I am 
primarily a party member, then a director." His strong 
enterprising spirit, selfless devotion, style of being upright 
and honest, and his broad vision of attaching importance to 
solidarity and taking the overall situation into consideration 
were precisely the embodiment of a high-level party spirit. 
Chen Wensong's sterling character and fine style are in the 
same strain as the numerous heroes and models in our party 
history. 
  As a contemporary intelligent entrepreneur, Chen Wensong had 
his own characteristics of the times which differed from those 
of past heroes and models. Facing new problems and new tests, 
he did not flinch and nor did he waver. He courageously met 
them face on and learned the art of swimming in the sea of the 
market economy, while improving his talent in the practice of 
reform and opening up. His strategic eye stood high and saw far 
and his superb and wise decisionmaking and managerial abilities 
enabled him to successfully lead the enterprise out of the 
valley and, furthermore, dash toward the world market, 
eventually joining the advanced ranks in the world shipbuilding 
industry. Every one of our cadres who are party members should 
follow the example of Chen Wensong and inherit the party's fine 
traditions, while continuously absorbing the rain and dew of the 
times to continuously renovate themselves and always stand at 
the forefront of the times. 
  From a secular angle, Chen Wensong was very poor, did not 
have rich properties, nor had he been given the senior 
professional title to which he was entirely entitled and nor 
could he have enjoyed more warmth and happiness in his family 
reunion; nevertheless, from the concept of life value, he was 
very rich -- he possessed a cause he cherished and had 
undeniable successes; he had won the party's trust as well as 
mass support and devotion and the spiritual heritage he has left 
people is invaluable. 
  Here, we should like to strongly appeal to the many Chen 
Wensongs striving at the forefront of economic construction: 
For the cause of the party and the people, for your enterprises 
as well as your families, please prize your own health and 
lives, for your health and lives do not belong to yourselves 
alone. We should like to strongly appeal to the various 
relevant leading organizations: Do please prize and do your 
best to protect the Chen Wensongs who are going all out to work 
for the party and the people with selfless devotion!

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese researchers 
have found a new way to raise the survival rate of trees planted 
on the Loess Plateau. 
  By retaining water or rainfall storage, the survival rate of 
trees in semi-arid areas has been raised to about 90 percent 
from 30 percent. 
  The new method, developed by researchers from Beijing 
Forestry University after five years' study, consists of 
collecting and storage of rainfall and maintaining soil 
moisture, is able to double or even triple the water available 
for trees in arid or semi-arid areas. 
  Arid and semi-arid land accounts for 52.5 percent of China's 
total territory, and the average tree survival rates were four 
percent and 30 percent in arid and semi-arid areas respectively.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wu Shuqing, Beijing University president; </F>
Zhou Shulian, researcher at the Industrial Economics Institute 
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; and Fan Hengshan, 
deputy director of the State Commission for Restructuring 
Economy General Planning Department by staff reporters Liu Zhida 
(0491 1807 6671), Fu Weihai (0265 1218 3189), and Chen Pingao 
(7115 0756 7559): "Development Is the Last Word"] 
  [Text] [GUANGMING RIBAO (GR)] The year 1993 is now over. 
Looking back on China's economic development in 1993 when 
macroeconomic control was strengthened, we can see the economic 
situation in the first half was different from that of the 
second half. How can we assess the overall economic situation 
in 1993? 
  [Zhou] In the first half of 1993, every field of the 
national 
economy grew rapidly, the GNP was 13.9 percent up over the same 
period last year, industrial production registered sustained and 
rapid growth, there was a good harvest of summer crops, the 
domestic market was brisk, and the residents' income went up 
fairly rapidly. 
  But this period also witnessed some problems, including an 
excessive investment scale and an irrational investment pattern, 
excessive money supply, chaotic financial order, greater 
financial difficulties, declining state foreign exchange 
reserves, acute structural contradictions, and great price 
fluctuations. All these indicators pointed to "economic 
overheating." It was to solve these problems that the party 
Central Committee and the State Council proposed strengthening 
macroeconomic control in a timely manner. 
  [GR] Some people have said that we should not be afraid of 
an 
"overheated economy." What do you think of that? 
  [Zhou] In my view, the statement is rather too sweeping. We 
should make specific analysis of the extent, nature, causes, and 
consequences of the "overheated economy" in question. It is 
incorrect not to strive for quicker economic development out of 
fear of "economic overheating." But if the economic overheating 
is so serious as to affect economic growth, we can no longer say 
we should not be afraid of it. We must pay special attention to 
this problem at the current stage when the old and new economic 
systems stand side by side and the old system is still 
functioning. 
  [Wu] In the first half of 1993, China basically followed the 
beaten path of increasing investment to develop the economy. 
Again, some people who were eager to accelerate economic 
development ended up bringing about a bubble economy. The high 
speed obtained this way was not the high speed for which Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping hoped. 
  [Fan] In my view, in the first half of 1993, reform 
coincided 
with development in a number of special fields. They were 
seemingly going full steam ahead but, behind the exciting 
phenomena, lurked undesirable problems which were more exposed 
in March and June. In general, what should have been 
accelerated was not and what should not have been, was. For 
instance, many localities were busy building provincial- or 
county-level markets but the important market for essential 
factors of production grew rather slowly. Most of the markets 
built with government assistance were almost deserted and some 
undertakings were overly expanded irrespective of actual 
conditions. For instance, government departments, enterprises, 
institutions, and individuals entered the property market at the 
same time when there was neither a fully-fledged market, 
effective management, nor transaction regulations. Take the 
futures market as another example. Comparatively standard 
futures markets did not exist in capitalist countries until 
their market economy had developed considerably but futures 
markets were opened in many places in China when we began to set 
up a market economy and when most people were completely in the 
dark concerning "futures." A survey shows that there are 
hundreds of futures exchanges or futures exchange centers across 
the country. 
  [GR] Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said during his south China 
tour, "In a big developing country like China, a quicker rate of 
economic growth is not always attained in a calm and steady 
environment. We must strive for a stable and coordinated 
economic development but stability and coordination is relative, 
not absolute. Development is, after all, the last word." Under 
the situation mentioned above, how should we interpret the 
statement that "development is the last word"? 
  [Zhou] As far as I can remember, when we were drawing up the 
"Eighth Five-year Plan," some people maintained that we should 
be content with 6 percent economic growth. It was after hearing 
this viewpoint that Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the statement 
that "development is the last word." In my view, Comrade 
Xiaoping actually gave us an important law governing economic 
development. That is a developing country usually experiences 
every few years a period of particularly rapid development in 
its efforts to achieve modernization. In the process of 
economic development, we are not likely to always enjoy a calm 
and stable environment as fluctuations are inevitable. Some 
comrades, however, defended the tendency to place undue emphasis 
on speed by quoting the statement, believing they could strive 
for a high growth rate at any cost. This was not what Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping meant. While speaking about the economic growth 
rate, Comrade Deng Xiaoping usually stressed the need to improve 
economic efficiency. For instance, he once said, "To develop 
China's economy, we should try hard to bring about a period of 
particularly rapid development every few years. Naturally we 
should not encourage an unrealistically high growth rate. 
Instead, we should get down to earth to work and should be 
particular about efficiency. We should strive for a steady and 
coordinated development of the economy." This reveals that 
Comrade Xiaoping regards efficiency as a precondition for 
high-speed development. Where the relationship between stability 
and development is concerned, stability is relative, development 
is absolute and is the last word. However, this does not mean 
that we can afford to ignore stability and coordination. There 
would be no smooth economic development if the economic 
structure were out of balance and there were drastic economic 
fluctuations. 
  [Wu] To build socialism, we must first liberate and develop 
the productive forces. If the cake is very small, how can we 
achieve common prosperity. Poverty is not socialism, nor is 
slow development. Development is the last word. The Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee set the party's 
basic line for the new period. I believe that the decision to 
focus on economic development, to uphold the four cardinal 
principles, and to persist in reform and opening up to the 
outside world all share the purpose of developing the economy. 
It is safe to say that "development as the last word" 
constitutes the core of the party's basic line. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, in fact, stated a very profound principle in the 
common language used by Chinese people. 
  However, the statement does not mean we can go ahead at the 
fastest speed possible irrespective of actual conditions because 
we cannot achieve economic development in one or two years. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping approached the problem from the high 
plane of a certain historical period. To develop the economy, 
we should not only increase the gross amount and the growth rate 
but also elevate the quality of the national economy to a new 
level in the following stage. Otherwise, we will not be able to 
catch up with others if we are inferior to them in terms of the 
quality of the national economy despite our high economic growth 
rate. 
  [GR] In that case, development is not a matter involving 
only 
the growth rate. Can we understand development this way? 
  [Fan] Naturally, development cannot be separated from the 
growth rate. But what is important is the type of growth rate. 
Strictly speaking, the growth rate itself does not indicate 
anything. What matters is whether the high growth rate is 
accompanied by an optimized economic structure and improved 
efficiency. For instance, the growth rate is 6 percent but it 
goes with a poorer structure and a lower efficiency. In that 
case, the 6 percent growth rate should be considered excessive 
and undesirable. On the contrary, if the economic structure is 
constantly upgraded and the efficiency improved, we should not 
regard a 20 or 30 percent increase as excessive--of course, I am 
talking in extreme terms. In the first half of 1993, the 
economic development was characterized by a high rate of 
investment and of consumption but the high growth rate resulted 
from a high increase in fixed assets investment, in money 
supply, in expenditure, and in imports. To solve the problem, 
the central authorities adopted a series of policies to improve 
macrocontrol, guiding the economic development and reform to a 
standard and healthy path. This was a very correct approach. 
  [Zhou] The policies proved successful several months after 
they were introduced. The excessive industrial growth rate was 
held down; the financial market was brought out of chaos; the 
real estate craze, the rush to set up development areas, and the 
stocks fever were cooled down; the yuan's value against the 
greenback went up immediately; the prices of raw and 
semi-finished materials gradually dropped; and the strain on 
transportation was alleviated. In a word, the overheated 
economy was successfully brought under control. 
  [Wu] On balance, the year 1993 witnessed good economic 
development. Though some problems cropped up, timely measures 
were taken and fairly good results were attained. Again, these 
measures converged with the reform measures decided on by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee for the 
next stage to provide favorable conditions for economic 
development in 1994. If the work is done properly, the economy 
will develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner in 1994. 
  [GR] The new formulation "in a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
manner" has attracted the general public's attention. What 
problems should we address in achieving this? 
  [Wu] The most important thing to do is to develop a new 
principle. In the past, we relied upon extensive management and 
reproduction, increased investment, and large scale construction 
for economic development. We must now replace the old principle 
with a new one, namely, we must rely upon economic restructuring 
and improved management and efficiency for economic development. 
  [Zhou] We must also tackle the problem of poor enterprise 
management. For example, there was an increase in the number of 
fake and shoddy goods, the production costs went up, there were 
more industrial accidents, workers were lax in labor discipline, 
and there were more violations of rules and regulations. The 
enterprise reform was designed to liberate productive forces. 
To turn liberated essential factors of production into actual 
productive forces, we must improve management. For the present, 
we must integrate reform with improvement of management and give 
equal attention to both. 
  [Fan] The central authorities have repeatedly stressed the 
need to keep tabs on the infrastructure and on agriculture. But 
we were only interested in extensive investment in short cycle, 
appropriate technology, and fast efficiency projects. As a 
result, the growth rate climbed, the structure was further 
distorted, and the efficiency stagnated. Over the last few 
years, such a phenomenon has occurred repeatedly. Thus, it is 
correct for the central authorities to call for a "sustained, 
rapid, and healthy" development of the economy. The root cause 
for the above-mentioned failings lies in improper management 
systems and mechanisms. Thus, to achieve a "sustained, rapid, 
and healthy" economic development, it is essential to solve the 
problems concerning the management system and to promote reform. 
In the meantime, it is necessary to exercise scientific and 
pertinent macroeconomic control. In particular, we should 
channel the limited amount of funds to basic industries, large 
and medium-sized state enterprises, and agriculture through 
implementing monetary, currency, and industrial policies. 
  It is also very important to correctly handle the 
relationship between development and opening up. The open 
policy is undoubtedly correct but we have misunderstandings 
about it. For instance, some comrades believe that opening up 
to the outside world is equivalent to setting up development 
zones and granting preferential policies. Consequently, they 
grant preferential policies to foreign businessmen whom they 
hardly know--such a practice easily causes losses of state-owned 
assets. Again, some development areas sold their land to 
foreign businessmen for several thousand yuan per mu and bought 
it back from them at millions of yuan per mu, after the property 
prices were jacked up. 
  [Wu] Such a practice is not allowed even in foreign 
countries. According to the theory of land rent, the increase 
in the land price is not due to the investment, so the added 
value should not go to the property developers. For instance, 
if the state builds a rail line on this piece of land, the land 
price will naturally go up. But the credit should not go to 
investors and the added value should go to the state rather than 
to investors. 
  [Fan] To make opening up a success, what matters is creating 
a favorable investment environment, setting up a sound legal 
system, and introducing mechanisms and systems compatible with 
international practices rather than offering land at low prices, 
granting preferential policies, and offering projects for 
investment. 
  [GR] Would you mind giving a forecast of economic 
development 
in 1994? 
  [Zhou] Many favorable conditions for economic development 
exist in 1994. First, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee has decided to carry out enterprise, monetary, 
taxation, and investment reforms on a fairly large scale in 
1994. This will breathe new life into the economy. Second, the 
rapid growth in 1992 and 1993 has laid a fairly sound material 
foundation for economic development in 1994 and the macrocontrol 
practiced in the latter half of 1993 has eased the strain on 
energy, transportation, and raw and semi-finished materials. 
All this will facilitate fairly rapid economic growth in 1994. 
Third, sufficient capital accumulation will make a fairly rapid 
growth possible. In terms of international comparable items, 
China's annual accumulation rate is over 30 percent and the 
capital output ratio indicates such an accumulation rate will 
help achieve a fairly rapid economic growth. Fourth, there is a 
greater demand for investment and a bigger increase in 
consumption. Some products are being updated and upgraded and 
they will possibly become hot items. Fifth, the policy-related 
environment is more congenial and this will contribute to 
economic growth and economic restructuring. And sixth, the 
economic development cycle shows that the year 1994 will see 
steady economic growth. A 10 percent growth rate is likely. 
  [Wu] In my view, at least two achievements made in the 
macroeconomic control in the latter half of 1993 will have a 
favorable impact on the 1994 economic development. First, the 
funds needed for key construction projects have been guaranteed. 
The amount of funds available for key projects in the last few 
years was not as great as it was in the second half of last year 
and this will ease the restrictions presented by "bottlenecks" 
on economic growth. Second, the funds needed for agricultural 
development have been guaranteed, thus solving fairly well the 
problem of "handing out white slips as IOUs" to peasants. 
  [GR] The year 1994 is crucial for reform and a number of 
reform measures will be introduced. Of all the enterprise, 
financial, monetary, taxation, investment, and planning reforms, 
which will be accelerated simultaneously in 1994? Which is the 
hardest nut to crack? 
  [Wu] Relatively speaking, monetary and taxation reforms are 
easy because thorough preparations were made in 1993. Though 
some localities will get up to little tricks, for example using 
up money stored for next year, increasing the base figure of 
1993 tax revenues, and so on, we will introduce the tax-sharing 
system all the same and find a way to hold the little tricks in 
check. Financial reform is comparatively difficult because 
changing a special bank into a commercial bank involves many 
complicated matters. For instance, if a special bank has a 
large debt to pay, how will this debt be brought forward? When 
a special bank has been changed into a commercial bank, it will 
not provide loans to loss-making enterprises. Will such a 
measure be allowed? The restructuring of the investment set-up 
is closely related to that of the enterprise set-up and the 
latter will become a hard nut to crack in 1994. We have carried 
out enterprise reform for 10 years but have failed to solve the 
problem. Now we have found a solution to the problem--establish 
a modern enterprise system. However, in the process of 
establishing a modern enterprise system, the state-owned assets 
may suffer great losses. The job is tough because while we must 
change special banks into commercial banks, we must prevent 
losses of state-owned assets. 
  [Fan] Enterprise reform is essential to the establishment of 
a new system, so we must work hard to make it a success. The 
enterprise reform began as early as 1980. We carried out 
enterprise reform by first delegating powers to enterprises, 
followed by the introduction of the economic responsibility 
system and the policy of changing from profit delivery to tax 
payment, a policy which was carried out in two phases. In 1987 
we introduced the contract responsibility system and in 1990 we 
proposed changing the way the state-owned enterprises operate. 
In short, we have tried in many ways to enliven the large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises but the results left much 
to be desired. The reason lies in our failure to straighten out 
the relations between management and ownership of enterprises 
and to set up an enterprise system and a mechanism that will 
effectively restrain operators on matters related to management 
and ownership of enterprises and will stimulate them to seek 
profits. It is correct now for us to shift from the policy of 
"relinquishing part of the power and profits to enterprises" to 
the policy of setting up a modern enterprise system. The reform 
in this respect should coordinate with administrative 
restructuring and the change in government functions. 
Nevertheless, even if we have established a modern enterprise 
system, it does not mean that everything will go off without a 
hitch because we will still have to tackle the problem 
concerning management. A good system only serves to provide 
enterprises with favorable conditions for developing themselves 
and the system and favorable conditions will come to nothing if 
operators of enterprises fail to make use of them. Therefore, 
enterprise management is an important issue. 
  [Wu] In 1994 we have another fairly tough task in preventing 
inflation getting out of control. At a meeting of the NPC 
Standing Committee, I said that the people are now concerned 
about three things: One, prices; two, the anticorruption 
campaign; and three, public security. They are indifferent to 
other things no matter what clamor you have made. The 
anticorruption campaign and public security are not our topics 
for today, so I will leave them alone. As far as economic 
matters are concerned, if we allow inflation to go from bad to 
worse, there will be serious consequences. When the inflation 
rate exceeds 20 percent, it will go up very quickly. It will go 
up at a great speed rather than step by step from 20 to 21 and 
then to 22 percent. Therefore, we should keep a close watch 
over the inflation rate and take action whenever something goes 
wrong. We must work hard to keep the inflation rate below 10 
percent. 
  [Zhou] The "Company Law" has just been approved by the Fifth 
Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee. This is a 
major event. With a law to go by, we can step up the reform of 
companies. We must set a clear objective in carrying out trials 
of the modern enterprise system. We must focus on solving 
difficult problems and analyze our experience gained in running 
the pilot cases. In particular, we must make concentrated 
efforts to solve the problem of separating the functions of the 
government from those of the enterprise because this is the most 
difficult problem for economic reform. 
  [Fan] In the future development, we must handle the 
relationship between economic development and economic 
legislation properly and guarantee a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the economy through enforcing the 
relevant laws and regulations. We have enacted many laws but we 
have only formulated a few of them from the prospective of 
development. 
  [Wu] There is one current problem with legislation. Since 
the law is drafted and enacted by the responsible department, 
the responsible department will tend to pass into law what is 
beneficial to it. In 1994, we should try to find out a 
principle for economic legislation that will sever economic 
legislation from the interest of any unit and that will give 
full expression to the objective demands of economic development 
and social interests.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Central China's 
Henan Province has become attractive to overseas businessmen, as 
the number of foreign-funded enterprises approved in 1993 
surpassed the total in the previous 14 years. 
  According to a local official, last year 1,653 
foreign-funded 
enterprises were approved, with a promised investment of 1.55 
billion dollars, up 73 percent and 77 percent over 1992, 
respectively. 
  And ten projects financed with loans of foreign governments 
to the tune of a total of 519 million U.S. dollars started in 
1993. 
  As a result, a batch of medium and large state-owned 
enterprises have made great progress in their restructuring by 
utilizing foreign funds. 
  For example, the newly established Jiaozuo Xinda Chemical 
Company, financed with 10 million U.S. dollars by a chemical 
industry factory in Jiaozuo City and a Hong Kong firm, has 
become the largest ink powder producer in the world. 
  The official said the paid-in investment reached 376 million 
U.S. dollars in 1993, exceeding the total in the previous 14 
years.

  [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China's 78 major 
auto factories last year produced a total of 1.18 million 
vehicles of all kinds, 100,000 more than in 1992. 
  According to latest statistics from the China National 
Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC), the total sales last 
year were 1.17 million units. Of the total output, 225,000 were 
sedan cars, with sales of 223,000. 
  A CNAIC official estimated that China's actual auto output 
last year must have exceeded 1.25 million, if the products of 
small auto factories are counted. 
  China's auto industry developed at a fairly high speed for 
32 
successive months until last June, when it was hit by a slump 
market, with both output and sales falling abruptly. Yet it 
still fulfilled the target of producing 1.1 million vehicles set 
at the beginning of the year. 
  To reinforce the development of the industry, the government 
decided last year to set up an auto department in the Ministry 
of Machinery Industry, and put the administration of the auto 
industry under the ministry. Formerly the CNAIC was responsible 
for administering the country's auto production. 
  A few weeks ago the Ministry of Machinery Industry 
publicized 
its 1994 plan for the auto industry, saying 1.3 million 
automobiles will be produced, of which 350,000 will be sedan 
cars, and the growth rate of the industry will be maintained at 
about 10 percent.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 13 (XINHUA) -- An experimental 
economic development zone in south China's Guangdong Province, 
designed to help the local poor, has reported initial 
achievements just a year after its establishment. 
  Located in Qingyuan City in central Guangdong, the Qingyuan 
Experimental Economic Development Zone last year had a total of 
some 1.6 billion yuan in investment, 48 percent of which was 
investment from overseas. 
  Construction of 42 projects started last year after the 
inauguration of the zone, which covers an area of 9.6 sq [square 
km.] Twenty-nine of the projects became operational the same 
year, producing a total of more than 300 million yuan in 
industrial output value. 
  To date, the zone has provided jobs to more than 1,000 
people 
from the relatively poor counties and towns around the city. 
  This year the zone envisages employing in stages more local 
people from such areas of the province. 
  According to a zone executive, the service industries in the 
zone are gaining increasing development momentum. 
  He said a 28-story building is under construction in the 
zone 
and is expected to be the zone's center of finance, stocks, 
futures and science and technology. A series of high-rise 
buildings, meanwhile, are planned for this year. 
  Experts hold that the zone has, in addition to greatly 
promoting local economies, also set a good example for poor 
areas across the country to shake off poverty in a faster way. 
  The impact and influence of the zone has been felt in a wide 
area of China, with similar zones blueprinted in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as well 
as Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (CNS)--China's coal industry 
last year saw its output of raw coal reaching 1.14 billion 
tonnes, resulting in loss-making of RMB 2 billion less than the 
year before and with 120,000 staff made redundant. [paragraph as 
received] 
  Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Wang Senhao, said at a 
national 
working conference on coal production held here today that the 
output of raw coal in the country last year increased by 25.5 
million tonnes over the year before. State-owned enterprises 
turned out 470 million tonnes of coal, a drop of 12.5 million 
tonnes, resulting in a sales volume of 412 million tonnes, a 
drop of 19.49 million tonnes. The output of local state-owned 
enterprises was 198 million tonnes, down 4.3 million tonnes. 
  The volume of coal transportation made up 40 percent of the 
country's total volume of railway shipments and problems faced 
in shipping coal was one of the major factors accounting for the 
drop in coal production. Owing to the rising of prices, 
collectively-run coal mines and township ones saw their 
production last year accounting for 472 million tonnes, close to 
that produced by state- owned ones. 
  Last year, the coal industry made progress in the drop in 
loss- making and redundancy action with its loss being reduced 
by RMB 2 billion or 30 percent less than the previous year and 
120,000 staff made redundant while another 130,000 transferred 
to other jobs. 
  According to the minister, the industry has in recent years 
made achievements in its industrial adjustment, paying much 
attention to the development of its diversified interests. The 
industry has, besides coal production, business covering power 
generation, chemical industry, construction materials and 
commerce and trade. Its output earned from its diversified 
interests reached RMB 18 billion and its profits tax from this 
sector RMB 900 million, increase of 20 percent and 22 percent 
over the year before.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (CNS)--Coal consumers in China 
have run up a total debt of as much as RMB 19.1 billion, the 
Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Wang Senhao, revealed. He said 
that serious difficulties facing the coal industry last year lay 
in the large amount of debt owed by coal consumers with the 
money in arrears increasing by RMB 3.8 billion over late last 
year. 
  Such debt, according to Mr Wang, resulted in a serious 
shortage of capital required by the coal industry with the 
payroll for coalminers being badly affected. Banks had to help 
pay salaries by giving coal mines loans. 
  The shortage of capital needed by coal mines make them 
unable 
to afford raw and processed materials as well as equipment, all 
of which are of great importance to the safety of coal mine 
work. As important repairs for mine facilities cannot be 
carried out because of lack of money, safety technology required 
by the coal industry had been adversely affected. 
  Statistics show that orders accepted by coal enterprises 
registered a sharp drop last year, making up a mere one-tenth of 
orders received in 1992. Orders for coal mining equipment 
amounted to a mere RMB 93 million for 1994, far lower than the 
RMB 651 million in 1992. Facilities for safety in the coal 
industry cannot be renewed because of the shortage of capital. 
  Should the input into mining production not be forthcoming, 
according to the Vice Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Zhang 
Baoming, the supply of coal will be in jeopardy. 
  These serious problems have been of great concern to the 
State Council which decided to allocate a bank loan of RMB 1.5 
billion to the coal industry to pay salaries to the miners, Mr 
Wang said. The State Council was determined that the People's 
Bank of China and the Economic and Trade Commission would be 
responsible for the settling of the debt in the coal industry 
and a national meeting of heads of branches of the People's Bank 
of China would place it at the top of the agenda for an early 
solution.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- China managed to 
increase its irrigated area by more than 330,000 ha [hectare] in 
1993, according to the latest statistics from the Ministry of 
Water Resources. 
  In the first three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period 
(1991-1995) the country increased its irrigated area by 1.4 
million ha, accounting for 71 percent of the target set for the 
whole period. 
  For various reasons, the country's irrigated area decreased 
year by year during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (1981-1985). 
But the decrease trend was brought under control during the 
following five years. Since 1991 the irrigated area has kept 
increasing. 
  By the end of 1993 the total irrigated area of the country 
had grown to 49.8 million ha from 16 million ha in the early 
1950s, showing an average annual increase rate of 2.6 percent. 
  Experts attributed the increase to the efforts of 
governments 
at various levels and the local people to build new and upgrade 
old water-control projects. 
  So far, one third of the country -- Hebei, Henan, Shandong, 
Anhui, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi and Qinghai Provinces and 
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region -- has fulfilled the 
irrigated area increase targets for the 1991-1995 period.

Houzhi (2621 0624 1807)] 
  [Text] Khartoum, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- In an interview with 
XINHUA reporters today, Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn 
Abu-Salih spoke highly of the friendly relations between Sudan 
and China. 
  Salih stated: Despite a series of changes which have taken 
place in the international situation, Sudanese-Chinese relations 
are still enjoying healthy development. This is a result of 
upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence in their 
foreign policies. 
  Salih added: The forthcoming visit to Sudan by Chinese State 
Council Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will more 
effectively promote the development of friendly relations 
between the two countries. The Sudanese people are proud of 
their friendship with China. 
  He pointed out: Sudanese-Chinese friendly relations have a 
long history. Sudan was among one of the earliest countries to 
support China's participation in the United Nations. The two 
countries established diplomatic relations as early as 1959. He 
added: The Sudanese people will never forget the Chinese 
people's assistance. In the past, China provided Sudan with 
eight loans which played an important role in Sudan's economic 
development. 
  Salih also stressed that China has consistently supported 
the 
stand of the Third World in international affairs and has won 
the respect of the world's public opinion as well as that of the 
Third World.

  [Text] Khartoum, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Sudanese Foreign 
Minister Husayn Abu-Salih stressed here today Chinese-Sudanese 
ties have registered considerable growth in various fields. 
  He described China as a strong supporter of the Third World 
countries in the United Nations. 
  The minister made these remarks in an interview with XINHUA 
before the visit to Sudan by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen . 
  The Sudanese minister said that despite the reforms in both 
countries and changes on the regional and international arenas, 
the ties between the two countries follow a correct course of 
development. 
  This is due to their commitment to the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence in their foreign policies, he said. 
  The minister added that the visit to Sudan of the Chinese 
vice- premier constitutes a strong push to the relations between 
the two countries and is highly appreciated by Sudan. 
  Salih pointed out that Sino-Sudanese relations have a long 
history. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 
1959 and Sudan was one of the first countries backing China's 
admission into the United Nations. 
  In 1993, the two countries signed an economic, technical and 
commercial agreement covering a wider range of bilateral 
cooperation, he added. 
  The minister stressed Sudan will never forget the assistance 
China has rendered in the past. 
  The forthcoming visit to Sudan by the Chinese vice-premier 
will open new spheres for cooperation between the two friendly 
countries, he said. 
  During his stay in Sudan between January 13 and 15, the 
senior Chinese official will meet with a number of Sudan's 
prominent figures, including President of the Republic 'Umar 
Hasan Ahmad al- Bashir, and discuss with Sudanese officials 
bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern. 
He will also visit a number of enterprises initiated by China 
in Sudan.

  [Text] Singapore, January 12 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
judiciary official has said that China and Singapore should 
cooperate in judicial field. 
  This was suggested by Ren Jianxin, the visiting president of 
the Supreme People's Court (SPC) of China, when meeting 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong today. 
  During the meeting, Ren said since cooperations in economic, 
scientific and technological fields between Singapore and China 
are expanding, there will be some cases that have to be resolved. 
  During Ren's meeting with Singapore Chief Justice Yang Pung 
How earlier today, the two sides agreed that China and Singapore 
should increase personnel and information exchanges and, in the 
due course, conclude an judicial agreement so as to defend 
foreign investors' lawful rights and legitimate private 
properties. 
  Goh said the planned judicial cooperation between the two 
countries would play a great role in promoting economic 
cooperation between China and other countries, which, in turn, 
will attract more foreigners to do business and to invest in 
China. 
  Ren and his 8-member delegation arrived here from Indonesia 
on Tuesday for a four-day official visit here at the invitation 
of Yang Pung How. 
  The Chinese SPC president will call on Senior Minister Lee 
Kuan Yew tomorrow.

  [Text] Singapore, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Ren Jianxin, the 
visiting president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) of China, 
said here today that China is continuing the building and reform 
of its legal system. 
  This is being done to safeguard the economic reform in the 
country and defend lawful rights of the foreign investors, Ren 
said when calling on Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew 
this afternoon. 
  Ren and his 8-member delegation arrived here from Indonesia 
on Wednesday [12 January] for an official visit from 11 to 15 
January at the invitation of Singapore's Chief Justice Yang Pung 
How. 
  He told Lee that China and Singapore agreed to sign a 
judicial agreement in a proper time to better protect the lawful 
interests and rights of Singapore investors in China and to 
ensure a smooth development of the economic cooperation between 
the two countries, especially the planned Singapore-Suzhou 
industrial township which is a government-support project. 
  Lee said it was only after 35 years of consistent and great 
efforts that Singapore established its current legal system, and 
it is just understandable that China, with its vast land and 
large population, would need several decades to achieve it. 
  Ren expressed his appreciation to Lee's view and said that 
China is determined to reinforce its legal system with the 
efforts of not only this generation but also the following one.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 13 (AFP)--China dismissed Thursday a 
U.S. State department report on human rights that concluded 
Beijing had made no significant progress in curbing widespread 
abuses. "It is a fact for all to see that since 1949 and since 
the implementation of reforms in China, tremendous progress has 
been made," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. 
  Wu reiterated Beijing's opposition to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's decision to link the renewal of China's most-favoured- 
nation status this year with "significant progress" in its human 
hights record. "Trade is after all trade," Wu said. "We are 
categorically opposed to any linkage of trade with issues 
irrelevant to trade." He also stressed that it was not for 
foreign countries to comment on China's human rights policy. 
"It is the Chinese government and the Chinese people themselves 
who care most about human rights ... and who have the right to 
evaluate human rights in China." 
  Despite its overwhelmingly negative conclusions, the State 
Department draft report praised China for engaging in human 
rights dialogue with the United States and releasing some 
political prisoners. Human rights is expected to be the focus 
of a possible meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that might 
be held at the end of January in Paris, Geneva or New York. The 
issue will also be raised when U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen visits Beijing on January 19 for trade talks with 
Chinese leaders.

Ministry spokesman said here this afternoon that "trade is after 
all trade, we are categorically opposed to linking trade with 
anything irrelevant." 
  He made the remarks at the weekly press conference when

to comment on a recent statement by officials from the U.S. 
State Department that in their view, China has not made 
sufficient progress on human rights issues for the United States 
to extend most-favored-nation trading status. 
  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said that it is the Chinese Government 
and the Chinese people themselves who care the most about human 
rights in China and likewise it is also the Chinese people 
themselves who have the right to evaluate how the human rights 
are in China. 
  He added that it is a fact there for all to see that since 
1949 and since the initiation of reform and opening drive in 
China, tremendous progress has been achieved in the country, a 
fact universally recognized, while pointing out that "trade is 
after all trade, we are opposed to linking trade with anything 
irrelevant."

visit by former U.S. President George Bush, he said that he 
believes that the visit will help enhance mutual understanding.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- China firmly opposes 
any form of official contact between Taiwan and countries having 
diplomatic relations with China, a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said here this afternoon. 
  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said that China never takes exception 
to 
non-governmental contact between Taiwan and countries having 
diplomatic relations with China. 
  "However," Wu said, "The relations between some of those 
countries and Taiwan have recently gone beyond that limit." The 
Chinese Government "firmly opposes any form of official contact 
between Taiwan and those countries having diplomatic relations 
with China," he added. 
  Wu made the statement when commenting on the so-called 
"vacation diplomacy" by the Taiwan authorities as Lien Chan paid 
a visit to some countries having diplomatic relations with China 
in the name of "a private vacation". 
  Wu pointed out that the so-called vacation diplomacy is but 
a 
new trick of "pragmatic and elastic diplomacy" of the Taiwan 
authorities whose aim is still to create "two Chinas" or "one 
China, one Taiwan", which is against the fundamental interests 
of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 13 (AFP)--China issued a strong 
warning Thursday to Singapore and Malaysia for allowing "private 
visits" by Taiwan Premier Lien Chan, saying they had overstepped 
the mark in approved contacts with the Nationalist island. "We 
never take exception to non-governmental contacts between Taiwan 
and countries that have diplomatic relations with China," 
foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. 
  "Recently, however, the relations between some of those 
countries and Taiwan have gone beyond that limit," he said, 
condemning what he described as diplomatic trickery by Taiwan in 
carrying on official contacts with certain countries under the 
guise of private visits. "This so-called `holiday diplomacy' is 
but a new trick of Taiwan's elastic diplomacy," Wu said. 
  Lien visited Malaysia and Singapore at the beginning of this 
month in what was officially defined as a private capacity, 
although he discussed bilateral economic cooperation with both 
his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts, Mahatir Mohamad and 
Goh Chok Tong. Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui is to embark on a 
private visit to Jakarta next month during which he will meet 
President Suharto, newspapers in Taiwan and Indonesia have 
reported. 
  Lien's visits were seen as a political breakthrough for 
Taiwan as foreign governments having diplomatic relations with 
China generally refuse anything that smacks of an official visit 
from Taiwan for fear of angering Beijing. Beijing and Taipei 
both claim to be the legitimate government of all China, and 
Beijing strongly opposes any official contact by any foreign 
governments with Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province. 
However, Taiwan has recently been flexing its economic muscle 
to open doors in Southeast Asia and Lien's recent successes in 
Malaysia and Singapore indicate that the tactic is bearing fruit. 
  Wu also rejected the suggestion that the attendance at last 
year's APEC summit of the chairman of Taiwan's Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, Vincent Siew, contradicted 
China's Taiwan policy. Chinese President Jiang Zemin also 
attended the Seattle summit. "China attended the APEC meeting 
as a soveriegn state while Taiwan was there as a regional 
economy," Wu pointed out. "You cannot confuse bilateral issues 
with APEC."

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 13 (AFP)--Franco-Chinese relations can 
improve gradually if Paris "strictly" respects bilateral pacts, 
the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday, in an allusion to 
France's past arms sales to Taiwan. 
  To end a freeze in relations that was costing French firms 
the opportunity to bid on large contracts in China, France was 
forced to promise Wednesday not to sell the Nationalist island 
any arms in future. China had imposed the freeze after the 
French sold Taiwan jet fighters in 1992. 
  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told his weekly press 
conference that Beijing "has always attached importance" to its 
relationship with France. "In recent years, however, the 
authorisation by the previous French government of the sale of 
arms has inflicted serious damage to Sino-French relations," he 
said. "We believe that as long as the two sides strictly abide 
by the principle underlying the estblishment of diplomatic ties 
and the relevant principles elaborated in the joint communique, 
Sino-French relations will be able gradually to improve and 
develop," Wu said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Sino-French 
relations will be gradually improved and grow steadily as long 
as both sides abide by the principles guiding the establishment 
of diplomatic ties and relevant principles underscored in the 
Sino-French joint communique. 
  Wu Jianmin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this at 
a routine news conference here this afternoon when asked to 
comment on the Sino-French joint communique issued yesterday. 
  He said that the Chinese Government has always attached 
importance to the preservation and development of its relations 
with France. 
  In the past 30 years since the establishment of Sino-French 
diplomatic relations, the spokesman said, fruitful cooperation 
has been conducted in the political, economic and other fields. 
  However, Wu noted, in recent years, the authorization by the 
previous French Government of the sale of arms to Taiwan 
seriously undermined bilateral relations. 
  "As long as both sides abide by the principles guiding the 
establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles 
underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French 
relations will be gradually improved and grow steadily," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jan (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin reiterated that the Chinese Government has 
always attached importance to the preservation and development 
of its relations with France. He emphasized that as long as 
both sides strictly abide by the principles guiding the 
establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles 
underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French 
relations will be gradually improved and grow. 
  Wu Jianmin made these remarks in response to a question at a 
news conference this afternoon. 
  A reporter asked: The governments of China and France issued 
a joint communique on 12 January. Please comment on the 
prospects for developing Sino-French relations. 
  Wu Jianmin said: "In most of the past 30 years since the 
establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations, fruitful 
cooperation has been conducted in the political, economic and 
other fields. However, in recent years, the authorization by 
the previous French Government of the sale of arms to Taiwan 
seriously undermined bilateral relations. We believe that as 
long as both sides strictly abide by the principles guiding the 
establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles 
underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French 
relations will be gradually improved and grow."

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman reiterated here today that the financial 
arrangements for the construction of the new airport in Hong 
Kong should be something for China and Britain to settle through 
consultations in accordance with the provisions of the 
memorandum of understanding on the construction of the project. 
  "This is always the position of the Chinese side," said 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin at a routine news 
conference here this afternoon. 
  He made the remark when responding to a question about the 
British Hong Kong Government having last week asked the 
Legislative Council to make allocation of funds to the 
provisional administration of the airport. 
  "Before agreement is reached between the two sides, 
unilateral actions will do no good to the settlement of the 
financial arrangements," the spokesman said. 
  He revealed that the Chinese and British sides still have 
working contacts within the new airport committee.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 13 KYODO -- China "understands" 
Japan's and Germany's desires to play greater roles in the 
international political arena by joining the U.N. Security 
Council, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday [13 
January]. 
  But the official indicated that the matter will be a long 
process. 
  "The reform of the Security Council is a relatively 
complicated issue which includes ratifying the U.N. Charter, and 
several procedural problems," spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a 
weekly briefing. 
  "Solving these problems is not a question of one or two 
countries expressing their opinion, but needs the full and ample 
deliberation of all the delegates to the United Nations. Only 
then can we strive for a method acceptable to everyone," he said. 
  Wu did not elaborate on China's position in the matter, only 
saying that China understands the two countries' hope "of making 
greater contributions to peace and development in the world." 
  During a two-day visit to Beijing last weekend, Japanese 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata briefed Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen on the establishment of a working group for the 
reform of the Security Council. 
  At that time the Chinese side made no response, a Japanese 
Foreign Ministry official said.

Chen Yonghong (7115 3057 4767): "To Be on Good Terms With 
Neighboring Countries and Establish Peaceful Order at Home -- 
China's Diplomatic Main Theme"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec (XINHUA) -- Soon after Chairman Li 
Ruihuan of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] ended his trip to South Asia, Pakistan's 
Premier Benazir Bhutto paid a visit to China. This not only 
reflects the close relationship between China and Pakistan, but 
also demonstrates to a great extent a key goal of China's 
foreign policy in 1993 -- attaching great importance to 
bordering areas, being on good terms with neighboring countries, 
and establishing peaceful order at home. 
  This year witnessed remarkably frequent exchanges of visits 
by the leaders of China and its neighboring countries. Among 
more than 30 heads and government leaders of foreign states who 
visited China this year, more than 10 are from Asian countries, 
with most of them from closely neighboring countries. Meanwhile, 
high-ranking Chinese leaders visited 10 neighboring countries. 
Visits to neighboring countries by new Chinese party and 
government leaders after assuming their positions prove that 
China attaches great importance to its relations with 
neighboring countries. 
  South and Southeast Asia became hot spots this year in 
China's diplomatic drive. Chairman Qiao Shi's trip to five 
ASEAN countries represents the first visit ever to ASEAN 
countries by a Chinese parliamentary leader. Meanwhile, heads 
or government leaders of five ASEAN countries visited China one 
after another, as did the ASEAN secretary general. Such 
high-level exchanges push ties between China and ASEAN countries 
to a closer, firmer, and riper stage. It stands to reason that 
this year is termed the "ASEAN year" in China's diplomatic 
efforts. 
  Chairman Li Ruihuan's trip to three South Asian countries 
marks the first visit ever by a CPPCC leader. In addition, the 
chairman of the Vietnamese Communist Party paid a visit to 
Beijing -- the first time ever since 1995. The premiers of 
India and Laos as well as the King of Nepal also came to China. 
  Meanwhile, Hu Jintao and Liu Huaqing, respectively, led a 
Chinese government delegation to visit friendly country Korea 
and our largest neighboring country, Russia. Leaders of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, including the president of 
Kazakhstan, also came to visit one after another. The Chinese 
Government's diplomatic agenda also shows that China attaches 
great importance to Mongolia and the five Central Asian 
countries. 
  Since Japan's new cabinet was formed, it has confirmed on 
many occasions that it will work hard to develop friendly 
relations between Japan and China. Following a visit by its 
minister of finance, an important member of Japan's cabinet will 
come to visit in the near future. Under new circumstances, the 
relations between China and Japan will develop in a sustained 
and stable manner. 
  Undoubtedly, close contacts not only help deepen mutual 
trust 
and good-neighborly ties between China and its neighboring 
countries, but also provide new momentum to expand their mutual 
economic ties and trade as well as scientific and technological 
cooperation. This will positively influence the promotion of 
peace, stability, and development in the region. Many leaders 
of neighboring countries said clearly that the "theory of the 
China threat" is absolutely unfounded, and that China's 
development and the expansion of cooperation with China conform 
to the common interests of the region. 
  Meanwhile, negotiations between China and some neighboring 
countries on pending border issues have achieved marked 
progress. Following positive results achieved at negotiations on 
Sino- Vietnamese borders, China and India signed an agreement on 
maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas under 
actual control. This is the first agreement reached by the two 
countries since 1981, when talks on border lines began, marking 
a substantial step forward in two countries' efforts to solve 
the border issues. Besides, China has achieved new progress in 
talks on arms reduction in border areas and strengthening trust 
in military issues with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and 
Tajikistan. 
  By unswervingly adhering to an independent foreign policy of 
peace, China has entered its best era in terms of relations with 
its neighbors. Without doubt, this is extremely important for 
today's China in accelerating its modernization drive.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Li Hubing] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, January 12 (XINHUA) -- America's European 
allies are happy with the results of the recently concluded NATO 
summit. Manfred Woerner, NATO's secretary general, described 
the meeting as "historical and a big step forward toward the 
next century." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton's current visit to Europe, his 
first since taking office, has attracted as much public 
attention as the summit itself. 
  The reason may be that people are eager to know: what 
changes will occur in the transatlantic security alliance now 
that the Cold War has ended? 
  The statements made by Clinton in Brussels demonstrate that 
the U.S.-European relationship remains generally harmonious. 
They share common views on many important issues concerning 
NATO's future and Europe's new security arrangements. 
  During the summit, the 16 NATO leaders agreed that the 
Western military alliance remains at the center of European 
security. 
  They endorsed the concept of building multinational task 
forces involving NATO and non-NATO nations -- the common joint 
task forces (CJTF) -- intended to make NATO more flexible in 
dealing with regional conflicts both inside and outside Europe. 
  Within this framework, NATO will provide military resources 
to European allies, if necessary. 
  The leaders also adopted proposals for establishing 
partnerships with former Warsaw pact countries. 
  Some former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland, Hungary, 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are eager to join NATO. But 
the proposal adopted, known as the "partnership for peace" plan, 
falls short of offering these countries either a timetable for 
membership or security guarantees. The NATO leaders instead 
have characterized NATO expansion as "an evolutionary process." 
  The summit was, however, dominated by a more urgent issue -- 
the war in Bosnia. 
  The leaders reaffirmed that NATO is ready to carry out air 
strikes in parts of Bosnia to break the Serb strangulation of 
Sarajevo if the United Nations requests such action. 
  They believe that if NATO continues to do nothing in Bosnia, 
its credibility would be seriously damaged. 
  In any case, the summit was a great success for the alliance 
and the consensus reached on almost all issues demonstrates 
transatlantic unity. 
  However, it must also be noted that the summit reflects a 
change in this relationship, having to do with reshaping 
European defence burdens in the post-Cold War period. In this 
prospect, the European allies will have to assume a greater 
burden. 
  It is clear that the "partnership for peace" plan and the 
concept of establishing the CJTF, which indeed will usher in "a 
new period" for NATO, also means that the United States will do 
less for European defense and security, and Europe will have to 
rely largely on itself. 
  Regardless of any commitments on Clinton's part, the 
Europeans know very well that the U.S. will not treat issues of 
European security the same it did during the Cold War. 
  The U.S. will not easily allow its 100,000 troops deployed 
in 
Europe to become involved in European conflicts. In the 
Yugoslav crisis, for example, the U.S. has argued that the 
conflict there is "a European problem." 
  It may be assumed that if the same conflict erupted during 
the Cold War years, the U.S. would not have remained a bystander. 
  With the end of the Cold War, NATO is entering a new era, 
and 
it is impossible for the transatlantic relationship to remain 
unchanged. Both the U.S. and its European allies are well aware 
of this, but are reluctant to point it out.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (CNS)--China continued to 
extend its economic assistance to developing countries in Asia, 
Africa, Latin America and the South Pacific region in 1993. A 
total of 272 items of foreign aid were carried out by China in 
72 countries last year with their accomplishment described as 
sound. 
  The foreign aid covered 77 complete sets of items and 113 
joint- ventured items involving technological cooperation. 
Eighty-two items were considerered preparatory for construction 
while 16 items were completed. Foreign aid items undertaken in 
Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Cameroon and 
Ethiopia, including construction of bridges, railways, a water 
supply project and an agricultural items, showed sound economic 
and social results. Nineteen new items covering a cement 
factory, a hospital, a highway, an acupuncture and moxibustion 
center, and a housing item started last year in such countries 
as Peru, Sudan, Burundi, Tunisia, Namibia and Mauritius. 
  China employed various patterns in its foreign aid including 
a combination of foreign assistance and cooperation of mutual 
interest in order to push forward direct cooperation between 
China's enterprises and those of the countries receiving 
assistance. A total of 45 items were carried out in 24 
countries assisted by using such a pattern. The number of 
contracts signed for such items between the parties concerned 
was put at 12. 
  China also offered some 50 batches of material aid to some 
developing countries in 1993 while at the same time striking 
cooperation with United Nations agencies involving cooperative 
activities between developing countries, offering them help.

<F P=106> ["Yearend special article" by ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE </F>
correspondent Zhao Haiyan (6392 3189 3601)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Relations 
between China and ASEAN countries this year have moved ahead on 
all fronts; in particular, bilateral economic cooperation and 
trade have been upgraded so rapidly and developed so steadily 
that they have become a mainstay cooperation between the two 
sides. 
  Analysts summed up cooperation between China and ASEAN this 
year as follows: 
  One, steady growth in trade and investment volume. 
  Data shows that trade and investment volume between China 
and 
ASEAN this year continued to grow at a rate of 30 percent. Trade 
between Singapore and China alone hit $4 billion. ASEAN 
countries such as Singapore and Malaysia now rank as China's 
most important trading partners. 
  Investment by ASEAN businessmen in China topped $2 billion, 
while China has undertaken engineering projects, developed labor 
cooperation, and opened 100 joint ventures in ASEAN countries. 
  Two, cooperation has become wider in scope and deeper. 
Against the background of extensive cooperation, regional 
cooperation is becoming a trend. 
  Economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN 
countries extended to entertainment, retail, manufacturing, 
petroleum, chemical, metallurgical industries and financial 
business. Cooperation has been strengthened in wholesale land 
development and infrastructural projects. Banks from ASEAN 
countries closely followed their businessmen into China and 
injected vitality into bilateral economic cooperation and trade. 
  Linglong [3781 3891] Incorporation of Malaysia, which made 
its entry into China only this October, has expressed interest 
in the development of China's coal-powered electric plants and 
highways. Apart from an industrial garden in Suzhou, Singapore 
has participated in the wholesale land development in Yintan 
City, Jiangxi Province. The Philippines are also involved for 
the first time in wholesale land development in Shishi City, 
Fujian Province. 
  Cooperation centering on the "Lancang Jiang-Mekong River 
Economic Circle" between Yunnan of China and South East Asian 
countries, such as Thailand, is in full swing, prompting 
regional cooperation between China and ASEAN countries. More 
wishes for cooperation have been witnessed between Thailand and 
Sichuan, the Philippines and Indonesia and Fujian, and Singapore 
and Jiangsu and Shandong. 
  Three, the appearance of joint-investments, a new form of 
investment. 
  This year, economic cooperation and trade between China and 
ASEAN countries changed from the "isolated duels and solo 
fighting" pattern, into joint investment. There are 
Thai-Singapore joint-venture investments in South East Asia and 
south China; Indonesia and other countries play a part in the 
joint-investment in a Thai-China satellite joint venture. Talks 
are underway between Germany and Singapore for joint development 
in Shandong and Wuxi; France is interested in joining 
Singapore's Suzhou Industrial Garden project. Joint investment 
integrates capital and technology in a better way and 
strengthens investment spending and, therefore, boosts its 
effect. 
  Four, officials' active attitude, encouragement, and 
guidance 
for bilateral economic cooperation and trade. 
  There were frequent visits between Chinese and ASEAN state 
leaders this year. Many of them accompanied by business people, 
signalling a strong wish from both parties to strengthen 
economic cooperation and trade. It was as if each visiting 
state leader was playing the role of the "best salesman." 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, Philippine President 
Ramos, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, and concerned 
Thai officials all stated, in public, their full support to 
their businessmen in pursuing cooperation with China, suggested 
learning the Chinese language, laid the groundwork for 
telecommunications, and urged Chinese businesses to enter the 
ASEAN market. Chinese government officials also stated, more 
than once, their support for Chinese firms to invest in ASEAN 
countries and moves to make it convenient for ASEAN business 
interests to develop in China. 
  Several things merit special mention: The first official 
ASEAN delegation visited China for talks on economic, trade, and 
technological matters; Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was 
invited to sit at a conference of ASEAN foreign ministers; ASEAN 
officially agreed to set up a special committee to coordinate 
and promote economic cooperation and trade between China and 
ASEAN countries. Without a doubt all these positive moves have 
increased business confidence and will certainly have a positive 
impact on bilateral economic cooperation and trade. 
  Five, mutual promotion and common prosperity are the 
consensus between the two sides. 
  China and ASEAN countries share the wish for cooperation, 
preserving differences, and seeking common grounds so that the 
entire region will prosper. Hartarto, Indonesian coordinating 
minister for industrial and trade affairs, once stated that the 
countries should reinforce each other economically to achieve 
common prosperity. He said that Indonesia is determined to 
become a newly industrialized nation in 25 years. Aside from 
its own efforts, it needs cooperation with other countries. An 
editorial in Singapore "LIANHE ZAOBAO" [United Morning Post] 
pointed out that the Singapore Industrial Garden project in 
China is a significant turning point for Singapore in its effort 
to internationalize its economy, while China has for its part 
consistently upheld the approach of developing economic 
cooperation and trade with ASEAN countries in a mutually 
beneficial manner. 
  Concerned experts believe steady economic cooperation and 
trade between China and ASEAN countries will continue next year 
and feature new elements. Cooperation between Chinese private 
enterprises and their ASEAN counterparts will become an 
important means of economic cooperation and trade between China 
and ASEAN countries.

  [Text] Moscow, January 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin began their 
first round of talks in the Kremlin today. 
  Clinton, who arrived in Moscow at about 01:00 (Moscow time) 
early this morning for a three-day official visit, said at an 
official ceremony for the meeting that his visit aims to 
continue building "new partnership with new Russia." 
  Yeltsin, in turn, said he hoped the U.S. President's visit 
may further bilateral relations. 
  The ceremony, which took place at the St. George Hall of the 
Grand Kremlin Palace at about 09:00 this morning, started by a 
rendition of the national anthems of the two countries. 
  The U.S. President came to the Kremlin from the five-star 
"Radisson-Slavyanskaya" hotel near the Moskva River, where he is 
staying while in Moscow. 
  According to his visiting program for today, Clinton was to 
sit down for the first round of talks with Yeltsin at about 
09:20 A.M.. At 10:30 A.M., Yeltsin will take Clinton on a brief 
tour of the Kremlin. At 11:15 A.M., they will continue their 
talks joined by accompanying officials. 
  In the afternoon, Clinton will depart from the Kremlin for 
the Danilovskiy Monastery to meet Aleksiy 11, patriarch of the 
Russian Orthodox Church.

  [Text] Moscow, January 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin resumed here this 
morning their talks in a "broader format," soon after they made 
a short tour of the Kremlin. 
  Earlier, the two leaders held their first round of talks in 
a 
"narrow format" at the Green Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. 
  Reliable sources told reporters that Clinton and Yeltsin 
discussed results of the December elections in Russia, political 
and economic reforms in the country and issues of world security 
and nuclear non-proliferation. 
  In addition, the two sides stressed the importance of 
Ukraine's readiness to sign, together with Russia and the United 
States, an agreement withdrawing nuclear weapons from its 
territory. The accord will be signed in Moscow on Friday [14 
January] by leaders of the three nations. 
  Clinton and Yeltsin also discussed the radar station problem

  [Text] Moscow, January 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin ended their second 
round of talks here this morning, which focused on economic 
cooperation. 
  The talks, scheduled for 70 minutes, lasted more than 90 
minutes, said Oleg Lobov, Russian National Security Council 
secretary. 
  He said the talks included discussions of economic 
cooperation between Russia and the United States, as well as 
U.S. assistance for Russia's economic reforms, including how to 
build closer ties between Russia and international lending 
organizations such as the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  Yeltsin spoke to Clinton of "positive shifts" in the process 
of reform, and said that they will not slow down. 
  Clinton said the United States would provide "maximum 
support" for the reform process, particularly in the social 
sphere. 
  The two presidents will meet again Friday [14 January] 
morning after the planned tripartite summit with Ukrainian 
leader Leonid Kravchuk, during which a historical agreement "to 
make the world a safer place with fewer nuclear weapons" is due 
to be signed by the leaders of the three countries. 
  Kravchuk will arrive in Moscow this afternoon, and is 
expected to sign an agreement on Friday to remove the 176 
nuclear missiles and 1,500 nuclear warheads which were deployed 
on ukranian territory by the former Soviet Union. 
  In the first round of talks this morning, which lasted one 
hour, the two leaders focused on the political and economic 
situation in Russia, said Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian 
presidential spokesman. 
  Clinton introduced the "partnership for peace" proposal to 
Yeltsin, said Kostikov, who added that the concept is still 
little known in Russia. 
  The problem of possible NATO expansion was also discussed 
during the initial talks.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the 
British side will withdraw its partial constitutional package 
and return to the negotiating table, a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman told a weekly press conference this afternoon. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said this when asked to comment 
on 
the report that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten might table the 
second portion of the constitutional package before the 
Legislative Council of Hong Kong in March. "We hope that the 
British side withdraws its partial constitutional package that 
has been submitted to the Legislative Council and return to the 
negotiating table in view of maintaining Sino-British 
cooperation and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong 
Kong," the spokesman said. 
  If the British side does not withdraw the partial 
constitutional package and goes on to submit the second portion 
of the package to the Legislative Council, he added, it will 
only demonstrate that the British side has set its mind on not 
returning to the negotiating table. 
  "The British side should bear all the consequences arising 
from this," he said. 
  China has reiterated that in a time when no agreements have 
been reached between the two sides, any legislation passed by 
the Legislative Council concerning the 1994/1995 election will 
not be accepted, he noted, adding that any institute or 
organization established according to that legislation will last 
only till June 30, 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The British Hong 
Kong Government should observe the memorandum of understanding 
on the new airport in Hong Kong, a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman told a weekly press conference this afternoon. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said this while responding to a 
question on Sino-British talks on the financial arrangements for 
the new airport in Hong Kong. 
  "The key matter regarding the financial arrangements for the 
construction of the new airport in Hong Kong is whether or not 
to observe the memorandum of understanding on the new airport," 
Wu said. 
  In compliance with the relevant provisions of the 
memorandum, 
the Chinese side has already put forward a whole set of 
proposals for settling the debt burden of the future Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, increasing the cost-effectiveness 
of the airport project and intensifying necessary supervisory 
mechanism, Wu said. 
  He added that China now hopes to see a favorable response 
from the British side. 
  "However, some leading officials of the British Hong Kong 
Government recently made remarks in public attacking the Chinese 
side on this issue," he said. 
  "This only points to the lack of sincerity for negotiations 
on the part of the British side. Therefore, should the talks be 
reopened, the British side ought to show its sincerity first."

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 20 KYODO -- China has agreed to 
cooperate with the United States on alleged "prison exports" in 
an apparent appeasement to U.S. demands for improvement on human 
rights issues. 
  The Thursday [20 January] announcement, made by visiting 
U.S. 
Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, comes four months before 
the U.S. must decide whether China has made enough progress in 
human rights to warrant a renewal of their most favored nation 
(MFN) trading status. 
  "Our governments have agreed on measures to ensure more 
effective prevention of the export of goods made with prison 
labor," Bentsen told an audience of Chinese social scientists. 
"China has also agreed to permit inspections of five prisons 
alleged to be producing goods for exports."

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Visiting U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said here today that the 
reopening of the Sino-American Joint Economic Committee is 
significant. 
  In a public speech delivered this afternoon at the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences, Bentsen said that one of the 
important missions on his trip to China is to co-chair the first 
meeting of the committee since 1987. 
  He said that a revitalized committee could provide an 
opportunity for both governments to discuss economic issues and 
help narrow the differences between the two countries. 
  The treasury secretary said that he was encouraged by 
China's 
recent efforts to reform the tax system, central bank and the 
financial system as well as the foreign exchange system. 
  He said that the reforms would put in place the tools for 
more effective management of China's rapidly growing economy and 
an expanded role for the market, and will assist in China's 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  According to Chinese officials, the Joint Economic Committee 
will hold its eighth meeting tomorrow, at which the two sides 
will brief each other on the economic development in each 
country and exchange views on bilateral issues.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that China and the United States should 
have more contacts and exchanges at different levels, build up 
mutual trust and make joint efforts to push bilateral relations 
gradually onto the normal track. 
  Jiang made the remark during a meeting with U.S. Secretary 
of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. 
  Bentsen is the first U.S. cabinet member to visit China 
since 
the presidents of the two countries met in Seattle last November. 
  Jiang, welcoming Bentsen, said that he hoped that the 
treasury secretary's visit would increase bilateral 
mutual-understanding. 
  Bentsen noted that both the United States and China are big 
countries and they share a huge trade volume. 
  The United States hopes to promote its economic and trade 
cooperation with China, said Bentsen. 
  He told Jiang that President Clinton was much impressed with 
his meeting with Jiang in Seattle and the U.S. President 
"appreciated the wise counsel you offered during the meeting." 
  Jiang said that he had a very successful talk with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton during the Seattle meeting and they had 
reached a common understanding, which is that the relationship 
between China and the United States is very important. 
  He said that the Seattle meeting created a new start for the 
development of bilateral relations and he hoped that such a 
momentum would be maintained. 
  The Chinese president said that both China and the United 
States should seize the current opportunity and create more 
contacts and exchanges at different levels, build up mutual 
trust, and make joint efforts to push Sino-U.S. relations 
gradually onto the normal track of development. 
  Sino-U.S. trade and economic ties are a very important part 
of bilateral relations, Jiang said, and China is focusing on the 
construction of modernization while the United States is also 
facing a task of vitalizing its economy, and the two economies 
are strongly complementary. 
  Therefore, he said, expanding exchanges and cooperation 
between the two sides in the fields of economy, trade, science 
and technology are in line with the practical interests of the 
two peoples. 
  China will quicken its pace in reform, opening-up and the 
establishment of the socialist market economy in 1994, Jiang 
said, and this has created new opportunities for further 
development of trade and economic ties between China and the 
United States. 
  Jiang expressed the hope that the treasury secretary would 
gain a better knowledge of China's economic development and its 
potential through the current visit. 
  Earlier this afternoon, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji met 
with Bentsen and his party and hosted a luncheon in their honor 
in the Great Hall of the People. In a candid and friendly [tan 
shuai you hao 0982 3764 0646 1170] atmosphere, they exchanged 
views on development of bilateral economic relations and trade.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sino-American Trade Tends Toward </F>
Normalization"] 
  [Text] Sino-American relations have shown signs of 
progress since Clinton met Jiang Zemin in Seattle in last 
November. Treasury Secretary Bentsen was assigned by Clinton to 
visit Beijing, which was a vigorous step to promote the 
normalization of Sino-American relations. 
  As everyone knows, the Sino-American Joint Economic 
Commission was suspended by the U.S. side after 1989. The last 
session was held in 1987, and the commission has been suspended 
for seven years. The Sino-American Joint Economic Commission is 
a very important organization for economic cooperation, which 
gives an impetus to technological cooperation between the two 
countries through intergovernmental planning, coordination, and 
promotion. For example, in the past, cooperative plans in such 
fields as metallurgy, telecommunications, electronics, 
machinery, and building materials were signed in the Joint 
Economic Commission. Moreover, both sides briefed the other 
party on economic development strategies, monetary strategy, and 
foreign investment policies to allow Chinese and U.S. 
businessmen to make complementary investment and open up new 
investment fields, thus leading to huge growth in the volume of 
bilateral trade. The convening of the Joint Economic Commission 
also helped both sides understand impediments to economic and 
trade cooperation and to remove some obsolete legislation and 
administrative measures, thus leading to vigorous growth in 
trade. 
  China and the United States are different in terms of their 
social systems, as well as in politics, culture, and history. 
If they are sensible enough to lay these differences aside and 
work according to the laws of economics, they can achieve what 
both sides want. Closer cooperation will not only benefit a 
certain party but both sides. Today, sensible figures in the 
United States have already noticed that U.S. economic interests 
are a top priority, while human rights diplomacy only comes 
second, and what is primary should be distinguished from what is 
secondary. It is not difficult for both sides to cooperate with 
each other as long as efforts are made to "seek common ground 
while reserving differences." 
  Bentsen is influential in Congress, and he is also an 
important cabinet member of the Clinton administration. He has 
visited China to hold a dialogue with Chinese leaders and to 
have a concrete understanding of the real situation of China. 
His visit is favorable to the healthy development of 
Sino-American relations. Therefore, Premier Li Peng said when 
meeting with Bentsen, "China and the United States should seize 
the opportunity to do something in a down-to-earth manner to 
facilitate, as soon as possible, the normal development of our 
bilateral relations." 
  Solid work refers to the Sino-American Joint Economic 
Commission co-chaired by Bentsen and the Chinese finance 
minister, in which both sides will study methods to expand 
economic cooperation and trade. The Chinese side is very much 
interested in introducing advanced technology and equipment from 
the United States and is also willing to open up its market, 
whereas the United States expects China to reduce tariffs and 
open its service sector to give U.S. businessmen more investment 
opportunities. Bentsen said: "The fact that President Clinton 
assigned me to visit China indicates that the United States 
attaches importance to the development of U.S.-Chinese relations 
and wishes to seek a way to further develop Sino-American 
relations, particularly economic and trade relations." Hence, 
in the next three days, it will be most important to know what 
issues the Economic Commission will discuss and what results 
they will achieve. The Chinese side is ready for cooperation, 
and the U.S. side has also indicated that "the United States 
should take part in the economic development process of Asia, 
and of China in particular." An attitude of positive 
cooperation between China and the United States will help, in a 
frank and sincere way, remove some obsolete and artificially 
imposed obstacles, expand the volume of bilateral trade, and 
reach a consensus. 
  Both Chinese and U.S. politicians acknowledge that a strong 
and prosperous China is advantageous to the United States and to 
the world as well. 
  This is not a formalistic gesture but an accurate analysis 
of 
current political and economic developments in the world. The 
outside world once tried to hasten the process of 
"democratization" and economic privatization of the former 
Soviet Union, hoping that a country with a planned economy could 
change into a capitalist country within a short period of time. 
Consequently, this gave rise to the "bombardment of the 
parliament" and such "democratic freaks" as Zhirinovsky and led 
to economic collapse, which is unfavorable to development of the 
global economy and to stability and security of Europe. 
  However, only in Asia has a situation of political stability 
and rapid economic growth emerged, and China has become a major 
factor in Asia's economic development. China's economic 
development is beneficial to Asia as well as to the world. As 
huge amounts of U.S. capital come to the East, U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Bentsen's visit to China will accelerate the process 
of opening up the China market to U.S. investors, which will 
also bring about greater development in economic and trade 
cooperation between China and the United States.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193) and Zhu Baihua </F>
(2612 4101 2901)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- The eighth session of 
the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee met in Beijing this 
morning. It was the first meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint 
Economic Committee since its activities were suspended in 1988. 
A joint statement was issued at the end of the meeting. 
  According to Chinese officials who took part in the meeting, 
the successful convocation of the meeting was of positive 
significance in narrowing the differences in economic 
cooperation between the two countries, opening up broad 
prospects for economic cooperation, and improving and developing 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The Joint Economic Committee was established on the 
agreement 
between Deng Xiaoping and then U.S. President Carter during 
Deng's visit to the United States in January 1979. The 
committee, as a center of Sino-U.S. economic exchange and 
cooperation, aims to coordinate and supervise the orderly 
development of economic relations between the two countries. 
  It convened seven sessions from 1980 to 1987. The resumed 
session today was convened upon the proposal of the U.S. side. 
  Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and the head of U.S. 
delegation and Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen cochaired the 
meeting. 
  After reviewing the Sino-U.S. relations in economic 
cooperation, Liu Zhongli said: China and the United States 
share broad mutual interests. The two countries are strongly 
supplementary to each other in economy, trade, and many other 
fields. The potential is great and the prospects are broad for 
developing mutually beneficial cooperation. 
  Bentsen said: The United States welcomed the progress China 
has achieved in its market-oriented economic reforms. An open 
and vigorous Chinese economy will not only promote the 
prosperity and stability of Asia, but provide important 
opportunities for American businesses and help create jobs for 
Americans as well. 
  The two sides exchanged views on such issues as China's 
reentry into GATT, the MFN issue, and the implementation of the 
three memorandums of understanding with regard to intellectual 
property rights, prison products, and market access, as well as 
the issue of multilateral development organizations. 
  During the session, delegates of both sides delivered 
speeches on special topics such as finance and taxation, 
banking, foreign trade, and external investment. The speakers 
on the Chinese side included Liu Jibin, vice finance minister; 
Chen Yuan, vice governor of the People's Bank of China; and Gu 
Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  During the session, the two sides also agreed that the ninth 
session of the joint economic committee would be held next year 
in Washington D.C.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- The eighth session of 
the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee took place in Beijing 
today. The meeting issued a joint statement here today. The 
full text follows: 
  1. At the invitation of Chinese Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli, U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen paid an official visit 
to China January 19-22, 1994. During his visit, Secretary 
Bentsen and Minister Liu co- chaired the eighth session of the 
Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee which met on January 21, 
1994. Secretary Bentsen also met with President Jiang Zemin, 
Premier Li Peng, and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. The Joint Economic 
Committee [JEC], in its new formulation, is designed to provide 
an integrated framework for addressing economic issues of mutual 
interest between the United States and the People's Republic of 
China. 
  2. In a cordial and frank discussion, the two ministers 
agreed that the committee would meet annually, alternating 
between the United States and China. The discussions under this 
framework are aimed at promoting three shared objectives: 
  -- Continued growth in trade and investment ties which have 
vast potential for benefiting both economies; 
  -- China's successful implementation of market oriented 
economic reform and integration into the world economy; and 
  -- Improvement of the legal and regulatory system so as to 
increase transparency and promote deeper economic ties. 
  3. To advance the dialogue on particular issues of immediate 
interest, secretary Bentsen and minister Liu agreed to establish 
initial working groups at the sub-cabinet level in three 
important areas: 
  -- Monetary and banking issues 
  -- Exchange system reform 
  -- Investment and economic cooperation 
  The ministers agreed that the working groups should meet at 
six month intervals, or as necessary, in order to report 
progress to the annual meetings of the JEC. The co-chairs 
agreed to designate officials to coordinate the technical 
assistance being provided under the auspices of the working 
groups. 
  4. On behalf of President Clinton, Secretary Bentsen stated 
that the United States supports a strong, stable, prosperous, 
and modernizing China. Moreover, the United States commends 
China's recent decisions to move forward with market-oriented 
reforms of its monetary and banking system, tax system, and 
foreign exchange system. The secretary offered to intensify the 
program of technical support for reform, drawing on the 
expertise of U.S. Government agencies: 
  -- The Treasury Department, including: The Internal Revenue 
Service, U.S. Customs Service, the office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency, 
  -- The Securities and Exchanges Commission; and 
  -- The Federal Reserve Board. 
  Secretary Bentsen also announced that Chairman of the 
Federal 
Reserve Board Alan Greenspan has offered to travel to China this 
year to discuss monetary issues in the reform process. 
  5. Secretary Bentsen welcomed China's decision to unify its 
exchange rates and improve importers' access to foreign 
exchanges as important steps on the road to GATT accession and 
to full convertibility. The United States expressed its staunch 
support for China's achievement of contracting partner status on 
the basis of the memorandum of understanding on market access 
signed by the two countries. 
  6. Secretary Bentsen highlighted the U.S. interests in 
supporting China's efforts to develop and reform its domestic 
capital markets, including improving opportunities for the 
participation of foreign financial institutions. 
  7. Secretary Bentsen also commended recent efforts made by 
China to implement the memorandum of understanding on market 
access signed by the two countries. Secretary Bentsen welcomed 
the recent conclusion of an agreement on textile trade and 
China's agreement to start services negotiations in February. 
At the same time, secretary Bentsen noted that many barriers 
persist and stressed the importance of further liberalization of 
China's trade regime. Secretary Bentsen also emphasized the need 
for China to open its services markets and improve enforcement 
of intellectual property protection. 
  8. Minister Liu Zhongli noted that the United States is the 
most developed economy in the world in terms of its economic 
strength and technological attainments, and the healthy growth 
of its economy has a significant bearing on the overall world 
economy. Minister Liu Zhongli indicated great interest in 
President Clinton's deficit reduction package and welcomed the 
resulting improvement in the U.S. economic activity. 
  9. Minister Liu Zhongli welcomed Secretary Bentsen's offer 
to provide and expand U.S. technical assistance for China's 
reforms, and appreciated the United States' continued staunch 
support for China's attainment of GATT contracting party status. 
Minister Liu also hoped that the U.S. would remove obstacles to 
the growth in trade with China and further relax restrictions on 
high technology exports to China. 
  10. Minister Liu outlined the recent reforms in China's 
foreign exchange system, including the unification of the dual 
exchange rate system at a single exchange rate responsive to 
market forces and the elimination of the requirement for 
official approval of most foreign exchange transactions on the 
current account. Minister Liu also indicated that China 
intended to achieve, over time, convertibility of the renminbi. 
  11. Minister Liu indicated that China will, on an 
experimental basis, allow foreign financial institutions to 
engage in renminbi denominated business and will further expand 
the geographic areas open to foreign financial institutions to 
some additional major cities. 
  12. Minister Liu stated that China has made earnest efforts 
to implement the existing memoranda of understanding [MOU] 
signed by the two governments. He expressed the hope that both 
sides will continue friendly negotiations on the unresolved 
issues in the process of implementation of the MOUs. 
  13. Secretary Bentsen and Minister Liu noted the keen 
interest of both countries in regional cooperation aimed at 
promoting sustained growth, improved economic relations, and 
further economic cooperation. Secretary Bentsen invited 
Minister Liu to attend the APEC finance ministers' meetings to 
be held early this year. Minister Liu accepted the secretary's 
invitation. Both leaders indicated their strong support for 
APEC related activities and hope that the finance ministers' 
meetings will promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific 
region.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 21 (AFP)--A group of illegal migrants 
who have just been repatriated from the United States to the 
southeast Chinese province of Fujian will probably have to pay a 
fine of 5,000 yuan (575 dollars) before being allowed to return 
home, a provincial government spokesman said Friday [21 
January]. The 118 migrants arrived in Xiamen by plane on 
Tuesday, after a flight from California, in one of the biggest 
recent repatriations of Chinese from the United States. 
  The official, in a telephone interview, said the group 
comprised persons who genuinely wanted to emigrate, and 
organisers who were involved in smuggling them to the United 
States. "The organisers will be sent to jail, and the sentence 
will be life imprisonment if they have committed atrocities," 
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "In 
principle, people who are victims of people smugglers have to 
pay a fine" of 5,000 yuan, "but do not have to go into a 
re-education camp" he said. 
  Reeducation camps are used for people who repeatedly try to 
emigrate without authorisation. In a similar case last year, 
659 Chinese repatriated to Fujian from the United States were 
sent to a re-education camp, a punishment that can be applied 
without trial and for a term of up to three years. Chinese 
sometimes pay up to 60,000 dollars for the clandestine trip to 
the United States, although the journey often ends in tragedy. 
Last June, eight Chinese died when they leapt from a boat laden 
with 300 illegal migrants as it approached New York.

  [Text] While it was rumored that pro-democracy activist 
Wang Juntao would soon be released, it was also recently rumored 
in Beijing that the authorities were considering releasing Bao 
Tong on parole, who was the political secretary for former CPC 
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. 
  According to sources, after CPC General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin 
met with U.S. President Clinton last November and after former 
U.S. President Bush recently visited Beijing, the CPC 
authorities discussed the release-on-parole of Wang Juntao and 
Bao Tong in order to show their attention to human rights and 
their intention of improving relations with the United States. 
It was said that most people agreed that Bao Tong should be 
released first on parole, because Bao was sentenced to only 
seven years' imprisonment and his prison term would expire in 
less than three years. Moreover, Bao Tong is quite old and he 
was a member inside the establishment (or inside the party). He 
would not do or say anything unfavorable to the authorities 
after being released. However, former President Bush and 
incumbent U.S. President Clinton did not mention the release of 
Bao Tong, so the Beijing authorities have not decided whom they 
will release first, but the result of the discussion was only 
that one of them would be released. 
  Reportedly, when meeting with Jiang Zemin in Seattle last 
November, Clinton hinted that if the CPC authorities did not 
take concrete action to improve China's human rights conditions, 
it would be difficult to extend China's most-favored-nation 
status next June. During Bush's recent visit to Beijing, Bush 
once again brought this message to the mainland authorities in 
moderate words. 
  The CPC top authorities have decided to release a certain 
prisoner as an expression of goodwill to the United States.

"Modernization Requires the `Hard-Boned' Spirit"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- Thirty years ago, the 
Sixth Company of a Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA] unit 
enjoyed great honor in the armed forces and was honored by the 
National Defense Ministry as "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" because 
of its steadfast combat readiness, strong militancy, toughened 
military skills, and strict military and administrative 
discipline. In 1985 after it was named by the Central Military 
Commission as the "Heroic Hard-Boned Sixth Company," the company 
became the only company in PLA history to have received the 
highest honor for two times. Over the past several decades, 
this heroic company has continued to perform new meritorious 
services in safeguarding the motherland and socialist 
construction; its "hard-boned" spirit has taken root, blossomed, 
and borne fruits throughout the armed forces; and many Sixth 
Company-typed companies have come to the fore one after another. 
  The CPC Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission 
always speak highly of the Hard-Boned Sixth Company and its 
"hard- boned" spirit. Addressing an enlarged meeting of the 
military commission in 1977, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: 
"As far as companies are concerned, they are doing the right 
thing to emulate the Hard-Boned Sixth Company because the 
company's work style should not be the work style of one company 
alone. All companies, and even cadres at all levels, should 
study hard and train hard like the Sixth Company, and should 
have the political awareness of the company." While inspecting 
the company in 1991, Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed that great 
efforts should be made to promote the "hard- boned" spirit, 
saying that "hard-boned" spirit means never bow before any 
adversity, but dare to fight and be brave to sacrifice to seize 
victories. 
  The "hard-boned" spirit is a fine tradition and a precious 
spiritual wealth of our armed forces. During the war years, it 
was this spirit our troops counted on to fight strenuously, 
march forward courageously, and win one victory after another. 
After New China was founded, it was again this spirit our armed 
forces have counted on in building themselves into modern and 
regular armed forces as well as in taking an active part in 
socialist construction and accomplishing missions of combating 
emergencies, providing relief, and rescuing people in distress. 
Because of their great contributions to China's economic 
revitalization and economic take- off, they have become 
important forces in socialist modernization. 
  The "hard-boned" spirit is also the Chinese nation's 
traditional spirit needed by people on all fronts of socialist 
modernization. Especially today when China has entered the stage 
of tackling key problems of reforming the economic system, 
deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, and 
gradually building a socialist market economic system, many new 
problems have to be resolved, and many hardships have to be 
surmounted. This requires our cadres and masses to emulate and 
foster the "hard-boned" spirit, defy all hardships, wage 
persistent and strenuous struggles, and move forward 
courageously until victory has been won. 
  To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must 
strive 
to arm our minds with scientific theory. Only when we are armed 
with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought can we have a firm and 
correct political bearing and a strong spiritual support. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics has inherited and developed Mao Zedong 
Thought. If we earnestly study the third volume of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and have a firm grip of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we 
will have a firm conviction and be able to uphold the party's 
basic line without wavering under all circumstances. 
  To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must work 
hard to master the knowledge and abilities which modernization 
needs. Our modernization drive is an extraordinarily formidable 
and complex mission which cannot be accomplished with courage 
and zeal alone. It also requires real abilities and close 
integration of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude. 
Comrades of all trades and professions must seize the time to 
study specialized knowledge and make constant efforts to improve 
their professionalism so that they can contribute their wisdom 
and talents to socialist modernization. 
  To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must take 
the interests of the whole into account and fight in unity. The 
key reason why we have been able to win in revolution and 
construction lies in the fact that our party and our people are 
a united whole. No matter how mighty it may seem, our personal 
strength and the strength of a small group are tiny, and only 
when our strength converges and pools together can it become an 
indomitable force. During the course of reform, opening up, and 
modernization, we must submit our personal, partial, and local 
interests to collective interests and the interests of the whole 
so that our party and the people of the country can become more 
united, and so that our strength as a whole will be even 
stronger. 
  The "hard-boned" spirit has strong characteristics of the 
time. While this spirit was needed in the past and is needed 
today, it will be needed in the future forever. In the future 
when our country's socialist modernization has developed with 
great vitality and when the people's living standards keep 
improving, the "hard- boned" spirit will continue to be the 
spiritual pillar supporting us to combat hardships and move 
forward, and it will continue to shine and go down from one 
generation to another when we are accomplishing our great cause.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Shuzheng (1728 2579 2398): "Good </F>
Example for Entrepreneurs--Notes on Deeds of Chen Wensong, 
Director of Dalian Shipyard"] 
  [Text] On 1 October 1992, Chen Wensong, the famous 
49-year-old shipbuilding expert and Dalian Shipyard director, 
passed away, leaving behind his utter devotion to the 
motherland's shipbuilding industry and the workers and staffers 
who had worked together with him day and night. As a communist, 
he realized his faith through his actions. Just as he wrote in 
a "self-appraisal": "The fact that I am appointed director of a 
shipyard with 10,000 workers and staffers proves the party's 
trust in me and only by working hard, heart and soul, will it be 
possible for me to live up to the party's expectations." 
<H6>  I. </H6>
  In the summer of 1985, Chen Wensong was promoted from deputy 
chief engineer to deputy director in charge of operations and 
soon after that he was appointed deputy director in charge of 
routine affairs. At that time, the enterprise had contracted 
debts of over 100 million yuan because of a foreign 
businessman's bankruptcy which caused him to cancel an order for 
a vessel the yard was building and there were few domestic 
orders for vessels for civilian. With production tasks inside 
the shipyard basically canceled the enterprise had landed in an 
operations "trough." 
  At a meeting of the shipyard's decisionmaking team, Chen 
Wensong stated: "We should compete in the world market!" 
Unfortunately, the wave of shipowners going bankrupt affected 
half the shipyards in the world, and Dalian Shipyard had no 
scope to exercise its ability in opening the world market. 
Nevertheless, a strange phenomenon surfaced: Many foreign 
shipowners visited Dalian Shipyard making inquiries about prices 
and placing orders for vessels; in 1986 alone, the management 
received some 230 foreign visitors in that category. Some 
people in the shipyard could no longer maintain their calm and 
were in favor of accepting the shipbuilding orders. 
  At a meeting of the shipyard leading body, Chen Wensong 
soberly analyzed the prices offered by those foreign shipowners 
as well as shipbuilding trends and cost, then flatly said: "No! 
We cannot accept these orders! This strange phenomenon is 
actually a trick being played by some speculators to take 
advantage of the recession in the world shipbuilding industry by 
suppressing prices to speculate in vessels. Should we accept a 
large number of shipbuilding orders, that would be like drinking 
poison to quench a thirst." Chen Wensong's proposal was 
accepted. The shipyard decided: Shipbuilding activities should 
be temporarily axed and ship repair services and nonshipbuilding 
activities expanded, while waiting for opportunities to accept 
shipbuilding orders. 
  Through two years of hard struggles the shipyard's output 
value for ship repair services soared, ranking top in the trade 
across China; its diversified operations entered the large 
equipment arena in the petrol chemical, metallurgical, and 
energy resource industries, with such pillar products as large 
steel structural parts such as boilers and steel-making 
converters taking shape. In 1985, the most difficult year for 
the enterprise, Dalian Shipyard still made a profit of 780,000 
yuan and, in 1986, the profit was 14 million yuan. 
  In 1988, there was a turn for the better in the world vessel 
market; for many shipyards it was like enjoying a great rainfall 
after a long drought, while accepting shipbuilding orders for 
export in batches. Through a detailed and meticulous market 
survey, Chen Wensong believed that the trend for vessel prices 
to go up would continue; prices for equipment and raw materials 
would continue to climb; and the time for accepting shipbuilding 
orders in batches was just not mature. 
  Soon, vessel prices on the world vessel market rose by a 
wide 
margin. At this point, Chen Wensong made a suggestion to the 
shipyard leading body: "Seize the opportunity, accept 
shipbuilding orders as quickly as possible and go all out to 
expand the proportion of shipbuilding." Soon, the shipyard 
signed contracts to build two vessels for export, one with a 
tonnage of 75,000 and the other 45,000, with an export 
transaction volume of $118 million. 
  In 1991, when the Gulf war came to an end, the prospects for 
the world ocean shipping business industry remained hazy and 
many shipyards were wavering and waiting to see. By that time, 
Chen Wensong had already been promoted to shipyard director; he 
had long been sending men to find out about the market 
conditions and came to the conclusion that a thriving situation 
in the world ocean shipping business was at hand. He took the 
lead in signing a contract to build a 60,000-ton oil tanker for 
the domestic market, creating a record in vessel prices on the 
home market; he was commended by the All-China Shipbuilding 
Industry General Company for the good beginning he had achieved 
for shipbuilding at home. After that, Director Chen seized the 
opportunity of the further rise in prices on the shipbuilding 
market and accepted a series of shipbuilding contracts for seven 
vessels with a total tonnage of 340,000, thus the shipyard's 
order books were full until 1994. 
  The success of Chen Wensong and leading members of other 
factories in the shipyard in their decisionmaking brought 
vitality to the enterprise. 
  Chen Wensong believed that to have a place in the world 
shipbuilding market, it was imperative to accelerate the process 
of the enterprise entering the world advanced ranks in 
shipbuilding. This 1965 straight-A graduate from Shanghai 
Jiaotong University, specializing in shipbuilding electrical 
engineering, had a solid theoretical foundation and a very high 
managerial level. He had command of three foreign languages and 
paid attention to studying science, technology, advanced 
managerial experiences of capitalist countries; had mastery of 
vessel design, manufacturing, and the financial affairs of a 
large shipyard and also the knowledge and skill to conduct talks 
about commerce and trade; and had gradually become an expert in 
shipbuilding electrical engineering, vessel design as well as a 
fine entrepreneur running a modern shipyard, who was renowned at 
home and abroad. 
  Today, the international shipbuilding industry is rapidly 
advancing toward the large and high-grade direction. Chen 
Wensong led the enterprise in keeping track of modern 
shipbuilding technology, making proposals and participating in 
the implementation of some important technological 
transformation projects. In the past, the No.3 dock in the old 
area could only manufacture vessel up to a tonnage of 30,000; 
through transforming the dock, production, and installing cranes 
weighing 1,600 tons, it was able to turn out large vessels with 
tonnages of up to 80,000. Chen Wensong's efforts can be seen in 
the completion and perfection of the production capability of 
the shipyard's new area with the building of a dock with a 
tonnage capacity of 100,000; with the importation and 
installation of a crane with a capacity of 580 tonnes, the 
largest of its kind in China and with the building of another 
shipbuilding dock with a tonnage capacity of 200,000 still under 
construction. 
  Chen Wensong worked hard in arduous exploration to shorten 
the shipbuilding period. When building the No. 3 vessel with a 
tonnage of 35,000, he persisted in keeping track of the 
production department's monthly plan and the workshop schedules, 
promptly harmonizing and resolving problems surfacing in 
production. As a result, the production period was 214 days 
shorter than that of the No. 2 vessel of the same type; the 
period of being anchored at the dock's berth was 103 days 
shorter than No.2 vessel; the date of delivering the vessel was 
5 months and 21 days ahead of the contracted date; and five 
vessels in the same batch were all delivered ahead of schedule, 
with the realization of the operational goal of turning out two 
additional vessels within a year. 
<H6>  II. </H6>
  In the summer of 1990, the relevant state department decided 
that Dalian Shipyard should be split into two, with the 
establishment of a new enterprise--Dalian New shipyard. When 
the old shipyard was split, a number of technological backbone 
and important equipment was also transferred along with some 
workshops and land. The enterprise faced great difficulties in 
production and sentiments of fearing difficulties surfaced among 
workers and staffers in the old shipyard. 
  It was true that the pressure on Director Chen's shoulder 
was 
greater than on anybody else. However, he had a staunch party 
spirit, a concept of the overall situation, and felt quite at 
ease. At an assembly for cadres of the whole shipyard, he 
mobilized them, saying: "In viewing a matter, we must proceed 
from the overall situation of the country. Cadres who are party 
members should pay attention to party spirit and show 
consideration for the overall situation. What we should do 
today is to create conditions and formulate measures to do a 
better job of building the old shipyard. At the same time, we 
should support the new shipyard in carrying out large-scale 
production as soon as possible. 
  Soon, the old shipyard set out the production strategy of 
"renting land outside the shipyard, while tapping the potential 
inside the shipyard." In addition, it formulated the blueprint 
for construction characterized by "a three-step process to 
revitalize the old shipyard." They transferred 60 percent of 
movable fittings to enterprises in townships and towns for 
production, thus resolving the shortage of workshops and space 
in the shipyard. With the founding of the new application 
workshop, electronic computer center, and shipbuilding research 
center, solutions were found, in turn, to the shortages of 
equipment, technological forces, and scientific research 
organizations. 
  In the wake of the split, Chen Wensong paid special 
attention 
to the matter of style to do a good job of handling relations 
with fraternal shipyards. In July 1991, a crack appeared in the 
outer casing of a diesel engine on a vessel for export; the 
diesel engine manufacturing plant sought help from the shipyard 
to repair it. Chen Wensong immediately ordered the relevant 
leading members to send the shipyard's best welders to take 
charge of it without setting out any condition. In addition, 
the overtime differentials and bonuses for the welders in 
question were all taken care of by the shipyard itself. After 
20 days of hard work, the shipyard workers fulfilled the task 
and the engine was repaired; consequently the good reputation of 
China shipbuilding products was maintained. 
  Dalian Shipyard has always possessed the fine tradition of 
party-government solidarity. After Chen Wensong took over the 
director's office, he placed very strict requirements on himself 
in every aspect and at all times. In a 1992 Director's Work 
Summary, he wrote: "The solidarity between the leading members 
of the party committee, the administration, and the workers' 
trades unions is the prerequisite for the healthy development of 
the shipyard's situation, with its work continuously improving. 
In our shipyard, the chief responsible persons of the party 
committee and the committee, administration, and workers' trades 
unions are able to unite as one." At the routine meeting for 
the shipyard directors, over which Chen Wensong presided, he 
always invited the participation of the leading members of the 
party committee and the workers' trades unions to jointly 
discuss the shipyard's major affairs. 
  Chen Wensong had been chief architect, chief supervisor in 
manufacturing, team leader for vessel delivery, and chief 
overseer on site, with many of the vessels being awarded 
national gold or silver prizes. Some of his theses on building 
modern berths and dockyards, as well as new shipbuilding 
technology, attracted the attention of ocean shipping and 
academic circles as well as top-echelon state leadership. Time 
and again he provided opportunities for others to be assessed 
for senior professional titles. However, the title of 
"national-level middle-aged and young expert with conspicuous 
contributions" was specially approved for him by the relevant 
state department, on the report submitted by the shipyard and 
city leadership without his knowledge when he was on his death 
bed. 
  Chen Wensong's home was very simple, displaying no 
high-grade 
furniture or electric home appliances. Aside from a color TV 
set, there was no camera, recorder, audio or video recorder. 
  Nevertheless, he left a very precious spiritual wealth. 
  Chen Wensong was a famous "Three-Seven cadre"; he started 
work at 0700, called it a day at 1900 and, for many years, he 
would accept only a monthly seven-yuan bonus. 
  With the exception of occasions involving foreign affairs, 
Chen Wensong was always in his overalls and safety hat, placing 
himself among the workers. He persisted in the shipyard's 
system of cadres participating in manual labor; when he was a 
workshop cadre, his record of manual labor exceeded 100 days 
each year; when he became an office cadre, his record of manual 
labor exceeded 25 days a year; and when he become a cadre at 
factory-level, his record of manual labor was not less than 20 
days. 
  All the waiters at the Beijing China Shipbuilding Industry 
General Company guest house knew that Director Chen was the 
"most important guest" with the least requirements; he would 
never pick a better room so long as there was a bed for him to 
sleep on. Once, Chen Wensong went to Guangzhou for talks and 
the shipowner made arrangements for him to stay at the White 
Swan Hotel; however, he would not stay there but was bent on 
booking into a small hotel and "a room for three" at that. With 
tears in his eyes, Wang Anguo, the shipyard operational 
department head, recalled: "On that occasion, the shipyard 
accepted an order worth 100 million yuan but Director Chen would 
not think of the expense of a hotel single room!" 
  In recent years, the shipyard authorities built a number of 
residential buildings for staffers and workers, while providing 
a thousand or so households with gas tanks. Wang Xuejin, an 
electrical workshop worker said: "I have two children, one big 
boy and one big girl, and our living quarters seemed a bit 
crowded; somehow Director Chen heard about our situation and 
allotted me a large three-bedroom unit. Only recently I found 
out that Director Chen had a big boy and a big girl, too, in 
addition to his two old parents; however, his housing conditions 
were poorer than mine, a common worker." 
<H6>  III. </H6>
  An extraordinarily big storm attacked the Liaodong 
Peninsula. 
  At around 2000 on 1 September 1992, Chen Wensong had just 
completed his report to the relevant leading member of the 
Ministry of Personnel and returned home. He got a telephone 
call from the shipyard saying that water had flooded No. 207 
warehouse in the Xianglujiao new area. 
  Director Chen waded in the flooded warehouse, carrying sand 
bags to block the water while directing people and trucks to 
hurriedly move equipment and raw materials away. At this 
particular moment, he felt pains in his chest and trembled all 
over; beads of sweat ran down his brow and face. 
  At dawn, the rush to deal with the emergency was over. 
Director Chen drove his car straight from the No. 207 warehouse 
to the shipyard area to inspect every berth, warehouse, and 
workshop along the waterfront that stretched 10 li. In the 
storm he strove, together with the workers and staffers 
accompanying him, giving orders while pushing a "great crane" 
that had been swept away by the waves to a safe zone. When the 
sun rose, he went to the office and began a new day's work 
  Back in early April 1992, Chen Wensong felt a dull pain in 
the left side of his abdomen. He went to the hospital for a 
checkup and it was found that there was a lump, 2 by 2.8 mm, 
between his liver and stomach. The doctor suggested an 
operation for further examination. At that time, Luo Yumin, 
deputy director and concurrently the shipyard's chief engineer 
was hospitalized for emergency treatment of metastasis cancer; 
on the eve of "1 May," a vessel was to be launched and another 
was to be delivered so Director Chen was really too busy! Thus, 
the checkup was put off. 
  By July, he often felt dizzy, thus he asked a doctor from 
the 
factory hospital to give him an infusion [shu ye 6551 3210]. He 
persisted in his work. 
  It was a holiday on 15 July. Engineer Liu Shande, the 
shipyard technology section chief was looking for Director Chen 
for a chat. He could not find him anywhere around his residence 
and, in the end, he went to the director's office and found the 
director reading documents while having his infusion. 
  By 3 September, his case had actually grown very serious but 
Chen Wensong had already been working almost continuously for 48 
hours. This tough guy eventually collapsed. 
  The related state department, and the provincial as well as 
city leadership gave instructions to do everything possible to 
save Chen Wensong's life. However, the experts and professors 
who made the diagnosis report on Director Chen's case were 
shocked: The lump which had not been properly defined in the 
past had now developed into a rare case of choriocarcinoma and 
had expanded to such internal organs as the stomach, liver, and 
lungs. 
  On his deathbed, Chen Wensong expressed a communist's 
sentiments to the party organization: "My thanks to the party 
and government leadership at various levels for their concern 
for me during this period. Should the treatment fail, I will 
have no complaints whatsoever. I will leave everything to do 
with my family to the organization's arrangements; I personally 
require nothing. I hope that everyone will do a good job from 
now on; the leading body should unite as one to do a good job of 
the shipyard. I have not done enough work at the shipyard, and 
I want very much to go on working...."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Huang Jibing: "Tang Helps Those Who </F>
`Learned' the Hard Way"] 
  [Text] When Tang Chaoming was 20, he held the highest 
position among the "educated youth" who were moved in 1974 from 
Sichuan Province to neighbouring Yunnan to help build China's 
largest rubber and coffee plantations. 
  Twenty years later, at 40, Tang is general manager of the 
only firm in Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, which strives to employ 
former "educated youth." 
  And the firm markets Yunnan's products in Sichuan. 
  "My life has been closely linked to the red soil in Yunnan 
-- 
first as a worker producing its products and then as its 
`salesman'," said Tang, a soft-spoken, heavy set man. 
  In 1971, at the height of the "Cultural Revolution" 
(1966-76) 
Sichuan sent 40,000 high school graduates to build Yunnan's 
plantations. 
  The drive was in response to Chairman Mao Zedong's call for 
educated youth to work in rural and less developed areas and to 
receive re-education from the peasants. 
  "We felt proud of being chosen to work in Yunnan following 
Chairman Mao's call," said Tang. "But we never expected the 
hardships we encountered there." 
  After a day's train ride and four days' walk, Tang and the 
other 18 year-olds reached a farm run by the Yunnan Provincial 
Wasteland Reclamation Bureau. 
  The farm was surrounded by rugged mountains and almost 
completely cut off from the outside world. 
  The students felled trees to build shelters and reclaimed 
wasteland to plant crops to feed themselves. The rules were 
strict: No one was permitted to leave the farm without 
permission. 
  "Because of the harsh living conditions, many of us wept 
when 
we arrived," Tang recalled. "I was also shocked by the 
wilderness, but determined to do all I could." Shortly after he 
arrived, Tang was appointed a section director. He quickly 
became popular because he was among the hardest workers and was 
always ready to help the weak. 
  Tang rose to become deputy director of the reclamation 
bureau 
in 1974, taking charge of the branch's planting of coffee shrubs 
and rubber trees. 
  "When cold weather came, we used our coats and quilts to 
cover the rubber and coffee trees to save them from damage," 
Tang said. 
  With the notion that man could triumph over nature, Tang and 
his colleagues had no inkling that some of the hilly areas where 
they laboured were unsuitable for growing coffee and rubber. 
  Worse, like most Chinese at the time, they had no conception 
of the market and reasonable production costs. 
  The stuff the "educated youth" produced was often stockpiled 
because their costs were too high. 
  "For example," Tang said, "it cost 8,000 yuan ($1,400) for 
us 
to make one ton of rubber, while it cost 2,000 yuan ($350) less 
to import a ton from Malaysia." 
  After eight years and the failure of some of their ventures, 
the "educated youth" became disillusioned and wanted to return 
to Sichuan. 
  "I also was disillusioned and I quit," Tang said. 
  He found a job in the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry 
Department of Sichuan Province. But he did not like the dull 
routine and resigned after four years. 
  He and three former "educated youth" founded a photo studio. 
From there, they set up a firm distributing home decoration 
materials. 
  In 1991 a group of former "educated youth" held a photo 
exhibition in Chengdu to mark the 20th anniversary of their 
arrival in Yunnan. 
  Most "educated youth" living in the area attended. Many were 
so moved they cried. Some returned daily, hoping to see friends 
they once knew. 
  Encouraged by the people he met at the exhibition, Tang 
dissolved his firm and raised 2 million yuan ($351,000) with 
some former "educated youth" to launch the shareholding Chengdu 
Chuandian Industrial and Trade Corporation in January, 1992. 
  Chuandian stands for Sichuan and Yunnan. 
  "By connecting the two provinces, we hope to continue to 
contribute to the Yunnan plantations where we devoted the best 
years of our lives," Tang explained. 
  They became more fervent about their goal after a survey by 
the United Nations Development Programme declared that coffee 
beans grown in Yunnan were better than beans from Colombia, 
South America. 
  They were further encouraged by news that the United Nations 
had invested nearly $10 million to help Yunnan import coffee 
packaging and production equipment from Europe. 
  What Tang's former work camp and now Yunnan's largest coffee 
producer needed was access to a larger market. 
  This was where Tang and his colleagues at the Chengdu 
Chuandian Industrial and Trade Corporation could help. 
  For nearly two years, Tang's firm has spent huge sums of 
money advertising Yunnan coffee in Sichuan's media. Tang and 
his colleagues also have taken advantage of their status as 
former "educated youth" and rallied the support of their former 
compatriots who now hold important positions in different 
sectors in Sichuan. 
  "Because of their special feelings for Yunnan, many former 
'educated youth' are willing to help its coffee find a place in 
the Sichuan marketplace," Tang said. 
  Their efforts have paid off. Yunnan coffee broke into the 
market in 1992 and was purchased by 30 large hotels and shopping 
centres in Chengdu. Tang's firm alone sold over 40 million yuan 
($6 million) worth of Yunnan coffee. 
  Last year, most large hotels and shopping centres in Chengdu 
and some other cities in Sichuan sold Yunnan coffee. Sales at 
Tang's firm alone registered more than 80 million yuan ($14 
million). 
  Tang ascribes much of the success to the firm's employees. 
  "As former `educated youth,' we work hard and can bear 
hardships," Tang said. "And, we co-operate with each other." 
  Because Tang's firm is the only Chengdu company which 
promotes its allegiance with "educated youth," some of them have 
applied to the firm for assistance when they've lost jobs or 
suffered setbacks in business. 
  Tang has done his best to help them, said Chen Dawen, an 
employee of the firm. 
  Last year, a Yunnan Province girl wrote Tang's company 
saying 
she had been born 17 years ago to an "educated youth" who was 
forced to abandon her when she returned to Chengdu. 
  The girl asked Tang to locate her mother. 
  Tang's firm not only found the girl's mother, now a teacher 
at Sichuan University. When it discovered the mother was too 
poor to move her daughter to Sichuan Province, it spent 40,000 
yuan ($7,000) for relocation expenses. 
  "The `educated youth' paid a heavy price in the past, Tang 
said. "As their former leader, I'm duty-bound to help them 
today."

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter He Jiazheng (0149 0502 2973), </F>
Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu Zhenying 
(0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- The state of the 
"shopping baskets" of urban and rural residents is a matter of 
great concern to the party and government. Yesterday morning, 
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and 
president of the state, visited the Science Town market in 
Haidian district, the Haizhong farm trade market, and the 
Wangfujing department store to acquaint himself with the state 
of market supplies and commodity prices prior to the Spring 
Festival. Jiang Zemin said: Fuel, rice, cooking oil, salt, soy 
sauce, vinegar, and tea are the seven daily necessities for 
people. A small "shopping basket" affects thousands of 
households, as well as social stability. Neither reform nor 
development can be separated from stability. All matters that 
affect people's basic lives and vital interests are of prime 
importance. Party committees and governments at all levels, as 
well as all work departments, must place these matters at the 
top of their agendas and devote great efforts and close 
attention to solving them with a deep sense of responsibility. 
No oversight or negligence of duty is permitted in handling 
such matters. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin; Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing 
Municipal Party Committee; and Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan arrived in 
the Science Town non-staple food market in a minibus before 0900 
[0100 GMT]. Located in Zhongguan village, the market primarily 
supplies and serves district residents from the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences and institutions of higher learning. Walking 
alongside shoppers, Jiang Zemin made inquiries to find out about 
commodity supplies, prices, varieties, and sales. He 
solicitously inquired about meat prices at the meat products 
counter. After finding out the prices of various meat products, 
he still showed some concern and asked: Were the prices lowered 
because of our visit today? The shop assistant told Jiang 
Zemin: We have used the same sales prices in recent days. At 
the general merchandise counter, Jiang Zemin made detailed 
inquiries about the shop assistant's working and living 
conditions, and the shop's business hours. He said: Workers 
and staff members at institutions of higher learning are busy in 
the daytime; we must ensure that they can buy food after work. 
At the entrance to a shop, Jiang Zemin shook hands with the 
shop's responsible individual and advised the latter: You must 
provide a good service to intellectuals and customers. 
  After leaving the Science Town market, Jiang Zemin went to 
the nearby Haizhong farm trade market. The owners of more than 
400 individual stalls in the building came from Shandong, Anhui, 
Henan, Hebei, and other provinces. These self-employed business 
operators from the countryside were pleasantly surprised by the 
general secretary's arrival at their counters. At a vegetable 
stall, Jiang Zemin asked about the prices of ginger, eggplant, 
French beans, chilis, and other vegetables and was advised of 
the stall's daily income. The owner, Zhao Xingfan, is a peasant 
from Baoding, Hebei Province. After finding out, to her 
surprise, that the customer who was making inquiries was the 
general secretary, the sincere and honest village woman said 
excitedly: General Secretary, it was very nice of you to have 
taken the trouble to come here. As he walked from one counter 
to another and proceeded from the first floor to the second, 
Jiang Zemin was greatly delighted by the brisk business and the 
wide selection of agricultural and sideline products at the 
market. At a meat counter Jiang Zemin specifically asked the 
owner whether the meats had been quarantined. He said 
emphatically: We must implement a strict quarantine system for 
all foods because consumers' health and safety are at stake. At 
another counter, Jiang Zemin struck up a conversation with a 
customer who was buying goods there. The customer was a female 
teacher from the No. 3 Zhongguan village primary school. Jiang 
Zemin asked: Is it convenient to buy goods here? After 
receiving a positive reply, he nodded in contentment and told 
the leading Beijing municipal comrades around him: Brisk 
business at country markets has enriched urban and rural 
markets; this is very important. Meanwhile, we must run 
state-owned shops efficiently and let them truly play their role 
in bringing prices under control, stabilizing the market, and 
ensuring supplies. 
  At approximately 1000 [0200 GMT], Jiang Zemin arrived at 
the Wangfujing department store in downtown Beijing. Offering a 
wide array of goods, the department store was crowded with 
customers prior to the holidays. When he saw some high-class 
and brand-name garments in the clothing section, Jiang Zemin 
asked a shop assistant: Do the garments sell well? The shop 
assistant replied: More and more people are buying high-class 
commodities because their living standards have improved. In 
the footwear and headgear section, Jiang Zemin struck up a 
cordial conversation with a young couple from the Huabei 
oilfield and asked them if they could afford the prices. Upon 
learning they were newlyweds, Jiang Zemin joyously congratulated 
them. 
  Shortly afterward, Jiang Zemin held informal discussions on 
market prices and supplies with responsible individuals and shop 
assistants from the Department Store (Group) Limited Company, 
shop assistants from the Xidan market and Chongwenmen vegetable 
market, comrades from the Andeli Neighborhood Committee in 
Dongcheng district and the Fengsheng Neighborhood Committee in 
Xicheng district, and price supervisors from Beijing 
Municipality, in order to directly hear their opinions. 
Participants in the discussions said: Fifteen years of reform 
and opening up have brought about very brisk commodity markets; 
people no longer have to worry about rationed supplies. On the 
other hand, commodity prices have undergone some changes during 
the process of socialist market economic development. The broad 
masses of people understand this situation. Recent substantial 
increases in grain and cooking oil prices, however, have indeed 
affected people's lives, especially the lives of retired workers 
and staff members. 
  After hearing their remarks, Jiang Zemin said: An ancient 
Chinese saying goes: "Food is the people's primary concern." 
We should never underestimate the importance of residents' 
"shopping baskets" because they have a direct bearing on overall 
economic and social stability. The goal of our party and 
government is to serve the people. Therefore, our leading 
organs at all levels and the broad masses of cadres must always 
show concern for the people's livelihood, serve the people's 
interests in real earnest, conscientiously eliminate 
inconveniences and difficulties for the people, and provide them 
with adequate supplies. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: Properly handling price-related 
work is of paramount importance. This is the general principle: 
We should always maintain commodity prices at levels that are 
affordable to urban and rural residents, as well as to people 
throughout society. This will help improve people's lives and 
benefit economic development and social stability. He said: 
Consumers in some areas scrambled to buy grain, cooking oil, 
and home electrical appliances for a time after late November in 
1993. This was not caused by inadequate supplies or an 
imbalance between supply and demand; rather, it mainly resulted 
from a lack of experience in effectively regulating and 
controlling prices after grain and cooking oil prices were 
freed, and from price rises introduced by people who were 
seeking their own individual interests. Moreover, we did not 
sufficiently understand some reform measures that had been put 
into effect. The party Central Committee and the State Council 
placed great importance on this problem and promptly introduced 
many measures to stabilize the market, bring prices under 
control, and tighten regulation and control. The market is now 
moving toward a stable state and has essentially resumed normal 
operations. 
  In his remarks, Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the work carried 
out by neighborhood committees and stated: Neighborhood 
committees are important bridges that bring the government and 
people closer together. They can help the party and government 
solve many problems and difficulties encountered by residents, 
defuse many contradictions among the people, and play a 
tremendous role in enhancing people's unity and promoting social 
stability. These vividly epitomize the superiority of the 
socialist system. In keeping with the new situation, we must 
greatly strengthen the work carried out by neighborhood 
committees; we should by no means weaken it. 
  To ensure market supplies, Jiang Zemin urged leading cadres 
at all levels to go down to the grass roots and continue to 
devote great efforts to the "shopping basket" project. 
Departments in charge of industry and commerce, commodity 
prices, technical supervision, and market administration at all 
levels should strengthen management; sternly deal with and 
punish people who commit such illegal acts as seizing the 
opportunity to drive up prices, disrupting market order, selling 
fake and inferior products, seeking huge profits illegally, and 
entrapping people; and achieve better results in stabilizing the 
market. He said: The Spring Festival is approaching. All 
localities and departments must take practical and effective 
measures to take care of people, especially those in 
poverty-stricken areas, and make proper arrangements for 
supplies during the holidays so that people across the country 
will joyously celebrate the traditional festival. 
  In closing, Jiang Zemin expressed his thanks for and 
conveyed 
his greetings on behalf of the party Central Committee and the 
State Council to workers and staff members who were working hard 
on the commercial and trade front. 
  Accompanying Comrade Jiang Zemin during his investigations 
and studies were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of the State 
Planning Commission, and Hu Guangbao, deputy director of the CPC 
Central Committee General Office.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Laixi (3769 0171 0823)] </F>
  [Text] Harbin, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, member of the 
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], emphatically pointed 
out during his inspection of Heilongjiang Province: Spring 
Festival is a traditional holiday to which Chinese people attach 
great importance. Prior to the festival, cadres at all levels 
should visit the masses, particularly the enterprises and 
families with difficulties, hold heart-to-heart talks with them, 
provide warm services to them, do practical things to help the 
poor, and help them spend a nice Chinese New Year. 
  During the 4-7 January inspection, Li Ruihuan was 
accompanied 
by Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang provincial party 
committee; Shao Qihui, governor of Heilongjiang Province; and 
Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the Heilongjiang provincial CPPCC 
committee. He inspected large state-owned enterprises, 
institutions of higher education, and scientific research 
institutes, and sought their opinions. He heard a report on the 
work of the provincial party committee and fully affirmed the 
achievements of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government in leading the broad masses of cadres and 
the people in seriously implementing the guidelines of the 14th 
Party Congress and the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as in overcoming 
difficulties, promoting economic development, and maintaining 
social stability. 
  On the present work, Li Ruihuan said: We must see that 
China's present situation is very good. All localities are 
displaying great momentum in undertaking construction and 
seeking development and are maintaining a fairly high growth 
rate. Living standards have generally and remarkably improved. 
At the same time, we must also soberly realize that owing to 
various reasons, living standards for some people have not 
rapidly improved, and they are even having some difficulties. 
Under no circumstances should we forget them. We want to take 
greater steps to accelerate development, but in the final 
analysis, our purpose is to improve living standards. For this 
reason, we must consider the interests of people from all walks 
of life in the course of development. In particular, we must 
ensure that the masses will encounter no serious difficulties in 
basic everyday life. 
  Li Ruihuan said: While most people will no doubt benefit 
from the reforms, not every individual is entitled to benefit at 
the same time and to the same degree. If a reform measure 
changes the pattern of the masses' interests, we must undertake 
careful study and use every caution before promulgating it for 
implementation. After it is promulgated for implementation, we 
must closely follow changes in the situation and undertake 
necessary readjustments or supplementary work in good time. We 
should carefully observe the masses' feelings, seriously listen 
to their opinions, and strive to help them overcome 
difficulties. This is the way to conform to the fundamental 
purpose of our Communist Party and ensure the smooth process of 
reform and opening up. 
  He emphasized: Spring Festival is also known as "year's 
barrier." It is our duty to help the masses with difficulties 
pass the "barrier." Cadres at all levels should know who among 
the masses needs help, visit their homes and talk to them, and 
seek their criticism and suggestions, even if the criticism is 
not pleasant to hear. We should "send charcoal in snowy 
weather" and do all we can to help the masses solve practical 
problems. We should properly reduce other expenditures and use 
the money saved to meet the needs in this regard. 
  During the inspection, Li Ruihuan met with the responsible 
comrades of the CPPCC committees of Heilongjiang Province and 
Harbin City and exchanged views with them on how to strengthen 
democracy and the CPPCC organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by Shen Zurun (3088 4371 3387), Ni Zhimin (0242 1807 </F>
2404), and Wang Wanqing (3069 8001 7230): "Seek Advice from 
Practical Work, Break Down the Barriers Obstructing Reform -- 
Stories About Comrade Zhu Rongji's Inspection in Anhui"] 
  [Text] It was the year-end and midwinter. As the sons and 
daughters of the Chang Jiang-Hai He areas marched into the new 
year with high morale, Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier, 
came to Anhui to inspect and investigate how the province was 
preparing for certain major reforms the state is soon to launch. 
Over a period of several days, Vice Premier Zhu and his 
entourage, in the company of Anhui Provincial Party Committee 
Secretary Lu Rongjing and Governor Fu Xishou, braved chilly 
winds and snow to visit some grass-roots units and rural 
households and discuss reform and development with the cadres 
and masses. 
  Conduct on-the-spot checks of grain prices. 
  As the saying goes, "food is of paramount importance to the 
people." People in urban and rural areas are ill at ease with 
the recent increases in grain prices. Vice Premier Zhu's 
concern for the masses could be observed from the fact that, as 
soon as he arrived in Anhui, the first question he asked was: 
"What is the price of grain in Anhui?" When told that the 
provincial party committee and government had taken timely 
measures to stabilize grain prices, he praised Anhui for having 
set a good example for the whole country. To check that 
measures for holding down grain prices had really been 
implemented, he sampled two grain stores in Hefei. 
  When he visited the Wangdacheng village grain station in 
suburban Hefei, the station manager told Vice Premier Zhu that 
his station still could make a small profit because he bought 
hybrid rice at 0.64 yuan a jin and sold it at 0.68 yuan. The 
vice premier asked with concern: "Do you need state subsidies 
then?" The manager replied firmly: "Not a penny from the 
state." Vice Premier Zhu nodded with approval, and said: "I 
think that when a business is properly run, and when it is 
willing to concede some profit, grain prices will not rise 
dramatically and the people will be satisfied." 
  It was getting dark and the provincial leaders asked Vice 
Premier Zhu to return to his residence to rest. But Vice 
Premier Zhu insisted on visiting another grain store. So he and 
some aides came to a grain store on Jinzai Road and chatted with 
the workers who were about to go home. 
  "How much does your grain cost?" "For nonglutinous, 
long-grain rice it is 0.78 yuan per jin; and for hybrid rice, 
0.75 yuan per jin." "What was the price before June?" "It was 
0.56 yuan per jin." "Why has the increase been so steep?" "I 
can't help it, the prices I had to pay were high." "It seems 
that when there are too many middlemen, the high service charge 
they collect jacks up grain prices." Vice Premier Zhu 
continued: "The current increase in grain prices is abnormal. 
It was jacked up by middlemen. Our food departments must play 
a major role at this time and take the initiative in regulating 
the market." A municipal leader immediately instructed the 
leader of the food bureau: "Provincial and municipal 
authorities have made a ruling. You should put up a notice 
tomorrow stating that the price of each jin of grain is 0.70 
yuan, not 0.75 yuan." "You can rest assured, Vice Premier Zhu, 
that we will hold down the prices." All the onlookers applauded. 
  Conduct on-the-spot checks on tax officers. 
  Taxes are the country's financial pillars. To understand the 
preparations being made for the implementation of the new 
taxation system, Vice Premier Zhu made a surprise visit to a 
taxation office under the city taxation sub bureau while 
visiting Anqing. Tax officers did not expect Vice Premier Zhu's 
visit. They were surprised but pleased, and gathered around him. 
  In a round of applause, Vice Premier Zhu greeted everybody 
and asked: "The new taxation system will start on 1 January. 
Do you all understand the system?" The officers answered 
together: "We basically understand it because training classes 
have been held." "Then let me just test you. The first question 
is: Will the consumption tax cause price rises?" The officers 
immediately replied: "No, no. This question was discussed on 
yesterday's television program." Governor Fu Xishou, who 
accompanied the vice premier's visit, smiled and said: "No 
wonder you are all confident of your answer." "Let me ask you 
another question. The past practice of collecting product tax, 
business tax, and value-added tax is being changed. Now a 
single value-added tax will be collected. Do you understood 
this?" A young graduate from the Shanghai Jiaotong University 
said confidently: "Yes." "Those of you who are university 
graduates please raise your hands." Many hands were raised 
immediately. Vice Premier Zhu was pleased and said: "You are 
young and possess high educational qualifications. It seems you 
have studied the new taxation system rather well. I feel 
relieved about that knowing the new taxation law goes into 
effect on 1 January." 
  Vice Premier Zhu asked a woman chief at the city taxation 
bureau: "The new taxation system will be implemented soon. Have 
preparations been completed?" "Basically there is no problem. 
We have just received 7,000 receipt books, which will be 
distributed soon to the officers in charge of the task." "Can 
you distinguish counterfeit receipts from genuine receipts?" An 
officer immediately replied: "The new receipt is water-marked 
and can be distinguished from a fake one the moment it is placed 
under a fluorescent lamp." "Is there any difficulty when 
separate organizations and personnel are introduced for separate 
state and local taxation tasks next year?" "We will abide by 
organization and distribution." "It is rational to separate 
backbone services." "Subordinates should obey their superiors." 
Vice Premier Zhu nodded satisfactorily. Before leaving, he 
joked: "My salary next year will all depend on you all then." 
A round of applause immediately broke out in the room. 
  Seeking proposals personally. 
  Investigation and study is one way to formulate plans. 
During his stay in Anhui, Vice Premier Zhu held discussion 
meetings wherever he went to hear the ideas and suggestions of 
grass-roots cadres and masses on reform measures. On the 
afternoon of 20 December, the usual silence of the Langxie Study 
on the Langxie Hill was broken and the atmosphere in the meeting 
room became lively. Vice Premier Zhu made a special trip to 
attend a discussion meeting in Chuzhou city, the "granary" of 
eastern Anhui. He sought plans and ideas from city and county 
cadres on the issues of grain purchases and sales as well as 
reform of the taxation system. 
  Provincial party secretary Lu Rongjing, who presided over 
the meeting, said: "Vice Premier Zhu's main purpose in 
undertaking day and night schedules during his current visit to 
Anhui is to hear directly your opinions on the grain issue. 
Please feel free to voice your opinions." 
  As soon as the provincial party secretary stopped speaking, 
city and county leaders vied to voice their opinions. They 
spoke on Chuzhou city's grain production, achievements, and 
difficulties, and forwarded their proposals. When Vice Premier 
Zhu heard the city had purchased all its wheat and 91 percent of 
its grain for this year, he smiled and said: "The crux of 
whether grain prices can be held down lies in whether state-run 
food departments have controlled grain supplies. We can only 
control and stabilize the market once we have controlled 80 
percent of grain supplies. How can state-run food departments 
control grain supplies? Closing the market does not seem to be 
a good way. I think purchasing should be done mainly by state 
grain enterprises. Individual proprietors may also purchase, 
but the purchase price must be within a range determined by the 
state. The government will intervene and adopt measures to 
check that prices exceed state standards. We must not allow 
grain prices to rise. Of course, state purchase prices must be 
reasonable, and the state should not purchase grain once it 
controls the majority of supplies. What do you think of this 
method? Will it work?" "Yes, yes." When the manager of the 
city's grain, oil, and food company reported that the company 
had been formed out of the city food bureau, Vice Premier Zhu 
asked for details of the company's operations. He said: "There 
is no choice but to reform the grain system. Is it possible to 
divide food departments into two parts, with one part involved 
in purchasing, processing, and wholeselling, while the other 
part does sales? Otherwise, grain will not be procured and 
sales will not be properly managed. The burdens for food 
departments will then be increasingly heavier. Yesterday, I saw 
two grain shops in Hefei city. The city has allowed the village 
to run one of them, the operation of which has been separated 
from state-owned food departments. It has thrived very well 
without any losses. The prices of grain have also been held 
very low. The other state-run grain shop is doing its own 
purchases in counties and selling its hybrid rice at 0.75 yuan 
per jin. When asked to lower the price to 0.70 yuan per jin, it 
said this was impossible as it would incur a loss and require 
subsidies. This must be changed." "This method is good." Vice 
Premier Zhu's thoughts received unanimous consent. 
  Frank discussion pushed the meeting to a climax. Vice 
Premier Zhu asked many questions and participants put forward 
their ideas and proposals in a steady stream. Occasionally, 
Vice Premier Zhu jotted a note or nodded in agreement. "All 
your opinions are very good. We must safeguard the peasants' 
enthusiasm for grain production while taking the capability of 
urban residents and peasants in grain-poor regions into 
consideration. After hearing comments from you comrades, we 
have now got a basic idea of the situation. I hope you will 
continue to come up with some feasible methods." "Thank you for 
your trust, Vice Premier Zhu." 
  The discussion meeting went on for nearly two hours, almost 
without people realizing it. Vice Premier Zhu did not show any 
fatigue, and he then allowed the Chuzhou city taxation bureau 
chief to sit at the main table....

  [Text] From 19 to 20 January, accompanied by provincial 
leaders Cheng Weigao, Chen Liyou, and Li Zhanshu, Zou Jiahua, 
vice premier of the State Council, inspected Jingtang Harbor in 
Tangshan city, Tangshan Iron and Steel Company, Douhe Power 
Plant, and Jidong Cement Plant. 
  According to the information released by Reporter (Shu 
Shouchun) on the evening of 20 January, while staying at 
Jingtang Harbor, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua inspected, along the 
wide newly built road, the construction situation of the harbor 
development area, listened to the report on planning and 
development situation of the harbor, and inquired about the 
detailed situation in building traffic, water supply, power 
supply, and communications facilities of the harbor as well as 
existing problems. 
  Vice Governor Chen Liyou introduced: Although Jingtang 
Harbor and Tianjin's Qinhuangdao Harbor may complement each 
other, while they cannot replace each other in functions. 
Through various forms, including the transfer of property 
right, Jingtang Harbor will cooperate with Beijing and Shanxi to 
build itself to meet the demands of economic development and 
opening up of the hinterland areas. At the same time, the 
harbor will take advantage of its large expense of sea beaches 
within the development area to absorb foreign investment and 
develop the near-the-harbor industry in order to build itself 
into a multi-functional harbor which combines industry with 
foreign trade. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua agreed to this idea on building the 
harbor and exhorted the harbor to develop the near-the-harbor 
industry within the development area in order to make full use 
of the harbor. 
  During the inspection tour, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also 
listened to the report on economic development of Tangshan city 
and construction of the harbor. He pointed out: Since the 
restoration of construction after being hit by earthquakes, 
Tangshan city has witnessed a very rapid progress in developing 
the economy, and thus there will be bright prospects for the 
development of the harbor. First, Tangshan city has such 
hinterland areas as Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia. Second, 
the city has vast land resources which is exempt the city from 
taking over land for construction and from relocating the 
people. Third, combining the harbor with the development area 
is conducive to developing the near-the-harbor industry. In 
addition, the cooperation with Beijing is very important. Among 
the several major cities around Bo Hai, only Beijing has no sea 
outlet. Now, Beijing has chosen Tangshan Harbor is of great 
significance to both Beijing and Tangshan. At present, the 
harbor has already have the condition for attracting goods from 
inland areas. We hope that Jingtang Harbor will successfully 
radiate itself to inland areas, select its own points of 
radiation, and strive to achieve success in building the 
near-the-harbor industry. 
  Also accompanied Zou Jiahua on his inspection tour were 
Zhang 
Kezhi, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Ye Qing 
and Chen Yaobang, vice ministers of the State Planning 
Commission; Xu Penghang, vice minister of State Economic and 
Trade Commission; Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry; Liu 
Qi, minister of metallurgical industry; Liu E, vice minister of 
communications; Sun Yongfu, vice minister of railways; and Zha 
Keming, vice minister of power industry.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wu Hengquan (0702 1854 2938) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- A proposal was advanced 
at today's National Conference of Public Security Heads in 
Beijing for the major tasks of the 1994 public security work: 
Give full play to the function and role of the public security 
organs as the organs of dictatorship; resolutely crack down on 
hostile forces and various criminal activities; deepen reform; 
improve service; practice strict management; promote 
comprehensive management of social order with vigor; strenuously 
maintain political and social stability; and make due 
contribution to the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system. 
  At the meeting, Public Security Minister Tao Siju conveyed 
central leading cadres' important instructions on enhancing work 
on public security and politics and law. Vice Public Security 
Minister Tian Qiyu delivered a report on the situation 
confronting the current public security work and on future tasks. 
  Last year, thanks to the efforts of all, various levels of 
public security organs accomplished well their duty of 
maintaining stability, of cracking down on enemies, of punishing 
criminals, and of protecting the people. In January-November 
period last year, the nation's public security organs cracked 
over 1.04 million of various criminal cases; recovered 4.8 
billion yuan worth of money and goods; scored remarkable results 
from extensively launching the drive to crack down on criminal 
gangs, on hunting down fugitives, and on solving major cases; 
successfully investigated into and handled a large number of 
major economic fraudulent cases; and helped the state prevent 
economic losses worth $130 million, or 400 million yuan. 
  In analyzing the current situation of social order, 
participants at the meeting were of the view that the social 
order at present is normal and that the normal social order has 
produced a reassuring effect on reform, opening, and on 
developing the economy. However, the number of criminal cases 
still shows a rising trend, particularly the number of major and 
serious cases. Social order in some regions is not good; 
criminals run rampant; and the masses lack a sense of security. 
  Participants at the meeting called for continuously 
upholding 
the policy of "severe crackdown on crimes" and for continuously 
exerting utmost efforts to stem the rising momentum of criminal 
cases. They called for concentrating efforts on "cracking major 
cases, cracking down on criminal gangs, hunting down fugitives, 
working out measures suited to local conditions, launching 
special campaigns, and carrying out special management over 
social order. As in regions where the security problem is 
serious, it is necessary to organize forces and to carry out 
unified action with the main efforts concentrated on cracking 
down on homicides, robberies, thefts, and organized crimes. In 
addition, special attention should be paid to cracking down on 
evil forces in cities and rural areas and to resolutely crack 
down on fraudulent economic activities of a criminal nature. 
  Participants at the meeting pointed out the current need to 
stress raising crime-investigation and crime-cracking levels; to 
crack more criminal cases; to crack major cases; to strictly 
enforce the law; to severely and quickly punish criminal 
elements by fully employing existing legal weapons; to 
resolutely rectify acts of imposing fines instead of meting out 
prison terms, of bending the law for the benefit of relatives or 
friends, and of downplaying the seriousness of cases. 
  Participants at the meeting were also of the view that since 
this year will witness the introduction of the most reform 
measures over the past decade, there will be some issues that 
will impact social stability. Properly handling various matters 
arising out of the contradictions among the people is a major 
and pressing theme for public security organs under the new 
situation to correctly handle the problems of contradictions 
among the people. It is necessary for public security organs to 
do a good job of explaining state policy among the people in 
active coordination with relevant departments, help timely solve 
problems brought out by the masses that should and can be 
solved, and help them reduce contradictions. At the same time it 
is necessary to resolutely crack down on hostile elements bent 
on beating, smashing, and robbing, as well as those instigating 
contradictions among the people. 
  Tian Qiyu said it is necessary to get actively involved in 
comprehensive management of social order; to enhance various 
preventive measures; to strengthen building of public security 
stations, in particular those in rural areas; to establish 
healthy grassroots organizations involved in protecting social 
order and to make sure that these organizations fulfill their 
role of protecting social order. Tian Qiyu called for an active 
studying and exploration of methods to control transient 
population. He proposed reorganizing, consolidating, and 
strengthening crime-prevention and social order management teams 
and to bring into play their important roles of maintaining 
social order. It is necessary to vigorously launch the "small 
security zone" activities, to do a good job in assisting and 
educating persons who have been released from prison after 
serving their terms and persons who have been released from 
reform-through-labor institutions; and to actively explore new 
ways to enhance security in enterprises under the new situation. 
More and effective efforts should be made in the work of 
eliminating evil phenomena in society. 
  Tian Qiyu stressed the need to further carry out the 
anticorruption struggle. He said that at present, particular 
attention should be paid to enhancing education among all the 
public security cadres and personnel on the purpose of the 
anticorruption struggle, on moral standards, on the mass line, 
on enhancing the mass concept, on firmly establishing the idea 
of doing all for the people and of relying on the people while 
forging closer ties between the police and the people. Finally, 
he called for continuing on-the-job training activities in a 
down-to-earth manner and for striving to raise the professional 
and law enforcement levels of the broad mass of public security 
cadres and personnel.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China's supervisory 
bodies handled 15,800 legal and disciplinary cases in the first 
11 months last year out of the 22,200-odd cases filed for 
investigation, a senior Chinese official said today. 
  Disciplinary sanctions were taken against 17,000-odd 
government employees, of which 32 were department-level 
officials, 378 county- level officials, said Cao Qingze, 
minister of supervision. 
  Exactly 1,031 of them were handed to the judicial sector for 
further investigation and prosecution, Cao said as he was 
reporting his work today at the annual inspection conference of 
delegates to the National People's Congress, China's supreme 
legislative body. 
  He said the supervisory bodies have been focusing in 1993 on 
corruption cases -- involving officials and other employees in 
Communist Party organizations, government bodies, executive law- 
enforcing branches and economic management sectors. 
  The corruption cases usually embraced the abuse of power, 
taking bribes, graft, smuggling and moral degeneration. 
  He said that after a year of hard work, corruptive practices 
had been kept "within certain limits", which he believed should 
"play an important role" in maintaining China's political 
stability and safeguarding its reform and opening to the world. 
  China's anti-corruption drive is going the right way, he 
said. "Better results will be achieved provided that it is 
persistent," he added. 
  The central government cancelled 143 illegal fees and 
charges 
imposed on citizens last year, said the minister, adding that 
"active measures" have been enforced to ban officials from 
making personal trips abroad at government expense. 
  Moreover, Cao said, government officials above county-level 
have been asked to collectively check their own corruptive 
practices, if any. 
  Most of the problems checked out have been handled according 
to the state laws and decrees; others are being investigated 
under the supervision of the ministry, Cao said. 
  The minister promised that all supervisory bodies in the 
country will continue to further the anti-corruption drive, in 
line with decisions made by the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China.

<F P=106> [XINHUA report: "Local Public Security Organs Launch Winter </F>
Offensive Against Crime"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Public security organs 
in various localities have achieved significant phased successes 
in an in-depth and resolute crackdown on specific crimes in the 
"winter offensive," with the theme of "cracking major cases and 
seizing escaped criminals." 
  This winter campaign concentrating on specific crimes was 
launched by public security organs in various localities in 
accordance with the Public Security Ministry's guideline to "do 
a good job in security work during the New Year and Spring 
Festival season and ensure that the broad masses can spend an 
untroubled and harmonious holiday" in light of their respective 
local situation. 
  It has been learned that, since the resolute crackdown 
began, 
through varied forms of cracking down and exercising control, 
Beijing Municipality, Shanghai Municipality, and Hubei Province 
alone have cracked 7,638 various security and criminal cases, 
have arrested 6,472 criminal offenders of all kinds, have 
smashed 781 criminal syndicates, and have seized ill-gotten 
money and goods worth more than 1.6 million yuan. The general 
public's sense of security has been greatly enhanced as a result. 
  The public security organs in various localities quickly 
went 
into action, put in a large amount of manpower, and cracked a 
great number of cases that had caused serious damages, made very 
bad impressions, and incurred the greatest popular indignation. 
Beginning on 12 November last year, the public security bureau 
of Xian City, Shaanxi Province, carried out consecutive 
operations for over 10 days in a row and smashed a syndicate of 
14 criminals, headed by Liu Qiang [0491 1730] and Liu Dongwei 
[0491 2639 0251], who had been robbing taxi drivers with knives. 
The public security bureau of Anshan City, Liaoning Province, 
cracked two unusually large cases within 10 days. In one case 
of robbery and homicide, there were hardly any clues left at the 
scene, but all the detectives took great pains and managed to 
bring the two criminals who were guilty of robbery and murder to 
justice. This bureau also solved an extremely large case of 
stolen gold and prevented state losses of nearly 200,000 yuan. 
The Shanghai Municipal public security bureau solved a heinous 
case of robbery and homicide which had remained unsolved for 
three years by catching the arch-criminals Wang Xiaolong [3769 
1420 7893] and Zhao Guofa [6392 0948 4099].

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Public Security Reports </F>
Rise in Crime in 1993"] 
  [Text] Chinese police uncovered more than 1.5 million 
criminal cases last year, 6.2 percent more than in 1992 a senior 
public security official said yesterday. 
  And the number of serious criminal cases -- including murder 
and drug trafficking -- rose 23.4 percent over 1992. 
  The 19,000 drug trafficking cases was a 32 percent rise over 
1992. 
  And police seized more than 27,000 drug traffickers along 
with 3,500 kilograms of opium and 4,200 kilograms of heroin, 
said Bai Jingfu, Deputy Minister of Public Security. 
  Bai said that the rate of criminal offences has reached 20 
per 10,000 people in China. 
  Although the figure is low compared to other countries, the 
government will continue to crack down on criminal offences, he 
said. 
  Since 1982, the crime rate has risen an average of 6 percent 
per year. 
  Bai made these remarks yesterday in a report to the National 
People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing. 
  More than 200 NPC deputies from Beijing gathered at the 
Great 
Hall of the People yesterday to hear ministry work reports. 
  In the next 10 days, the group will be preparing for the 
Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, scheduled for March 10. 
  In the fight against crime last year police handled 15,000 
cases involving the kidnapping and trafficking of women and 
children, the deputy minister said. 
  The police also recovered stolen money and goods valued at 
more than 4.08 billion yuan ($469 million) during the first 11 
months last year, double the amount secured in the whole of 1992. 
  According to Bai, robbery and theft accounted for 80 percent 
of last year's criminal offences. 
  Last year, more than 300,000 robberies and 150,000 thefts 
were filed up 20 percent and 21.6 percent over the figures in 
1992. 
  Bai also said more offenders last year were involved in 
gangs 
or used violence. 
  During the first 11 months of last year, Chinese police 
caught more than 780,000 gang members and handled 185,000 
gang-related cases. The figures were up 55.5 percent and 49.7 
percent respectively over 1992, he said. 
  The deputy minister noted that gang activities have been a 
problem for a long time in China's suburbs and countryside. 
  In terms of violent crimes, more than 32,000 people were 
murdered and more than 80,000 people were injured, up 7.8 
percent and 8.6 percent respectively over 1992.

<F P=106> [Report by XINHUA reporter Ge Jindong (5556 6855 2639) and </F>
staff reporter Fu Xu (0265 2485): "Inner Mongolia's Armed 
Police Corps Helps Promote Border Trade, Local Tourism"] 
  [Text] Hohhot, 9 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO) -- The armed border 
police of Inner Mongolia, who fight on the 4,000 km frontier in 
northern China, have displayed the spirit of plain living and 
hard struggle and have brought about gratifying changes to the 
building of grassroots units. 
  The officers and men of Inner Mongolia's armed border police 
fight and live on the Gobi grassland and in desert forests, 
where the environment is harsh and the climate is miserable year 
in and year out. They shoulder very difficult border defense 
tasks. According to the requirements of public security and 
frontier defense work on the building of Army units under the 
new circumstances, the frontier corps party committee made 
strenuous efforts in grassroots building, improved the working 
and living conditions of officers and men, and helped bring the 
building of the force and its professionalism to a new height. 
  This frontier corps has also been working hard to serve the 
autonomous region's economic construction. Over the past three 
years, they have reformed some means and methods of management 
that are out of pace with the situation and impede the economic 
development of the border region and have simplified the 
procedures for the granting of entry/exit permits and border 
inspection. They have brought into full play the advantages of 
border defense and have taken advantage of their contacts with 
the border defense departments of Russia and Mongolia to build 
connections for the development of border trade, tourism, 
investment, and exploitation between localities. Statistics 
have shown that, during those three years, the border inspection 
stations had over 900 meetings and talks with parties in Russia 
and Mongolia and quite successfully accomplished the tasks 
assigned by the governments at various levels and the relevant 
departments, for which they were praised by local party 
committees and governments.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- The ZHONGGUO JIAO YU BAO 
[China Education Journal] reported that Hunan's Xintian County 
has never owed its teachers any pay and that all funds due them 
have been paid in full all these years. 
  Xintian County takes three measures to guarantee the payment 
of teachers' salaries. First, educational funds are budgeted at 
the beginning of a fiscal year with appropriate annual 
increments according to needs, making very sure that funds for 
personnel are adequate. Second, when money is tight, top 
priority is given to teachers' salaries. Because Xintian County 
derives its revenue from flue-cured tobacco, all funds will have 
to go to the procurement of tobacco leaves in the first half of 
the year, and revenues will only be collected in the second half 
of the year when peasants sell their crops. As such, the county 
has established the following priorities for paying salaries: 
middle and primary school teachers first, grass-roots cadres 
next, and units directly under the county government last. 
Third, individual villages and towns having difficulties will 
receive the personal attention of the secretary and the county 
head. 
  Because they have been affected by the financial and 
taxation 
reform, the county's revenues will be reduced sharply this year. 
What happens to teachers' salaries? After study, the county has 
found its way out of the situation by dividing the educational 
funds into three parts -- funds for organ and school personnel, 
projects, and funds -- with separate management.

<F P=106> [By Quinton Chan] </F>
  [Text] The bell rings...children in designer blue uniforms 
rush to their parents, waiting by the sleek Mercedes-Benz, Lexus 
and Toyotas in the school car park. 
  But this is no mainland-based international school -- it is 
China's first school for the wealthy. Located in Conghua, a 
small county 90 kilometres from Guangzhou, Guangdong province, 
the Hero's China Primary School marks the wealth of the state 
after 14 years of the open-door policy and economic reforms. 
  "The setting up of the school has followed the change in 
society," school spokesman Chen Haihong said. "It's just like 
the emergence of five-star hotels in the city...inevitable." 
And this is a "five-star" school. Costing 100 million yuan 
(about HK$88.5 million), its facilities are beyond anything most 
mainland Chinese can imagine. 
  Its 4.5-square-kilometre campus compares with anything in 
Hong Kong, and includes a football pitch and stands, an 
international- standard swimming pool, two tennis courts, 
several basketball courts, a health club, a computer laboratory, 
a language centre...even a mini zoo. Teachers, students and 
ancillary staff live in a well-furnished three-storey hostel 
nearby. 
  The tuition fee for the whole primary education is 300,000 
yuan -- equal to the life wages of a worker earning about 500 
yuan a month. But the fees can be refunded after students 
finish their course, according to the school's spokeswoman, Yang 
Shaomei. "It is a new concept," she said. "We take the money 
for investment and then we can return money to parents." 
  Launched in September last year, the first private school in 
the country is owned by the Guangzhou Power Station and two 
private firms, Zhong Luan Enterprise and Lingnan Training 
Centre. With 750 students, the school raised more than the 100 
million yuan construction cost. 
  Most of the parents were senior officials, big businessmen 
or 
managers of large corporations, Mr. Chen said. "We are not a 
noble school since there is no noble class in China," he said. 
  A businessman with a nine-year-old son studying at the 
school 
said: "It is worth paying such a large amount to let my child 
study here. It is a very nice school. I hope my son can become 
a university graduate in the future and help my business to 
succeed." 
  Even children are discovering they are lucky to have a place 
at such an impressive educational facility. "I am very lucky, 
my family is rich," 12-year-old Li Chikang said. "Other 
children are not so lucky, they have to study in schools which 
have poorer facilities." 
  But the abundant facilities and pleasant environment do not 
mean students have an easy school life -- the primary course is 
tougher than in any other school in the country. Students have 
to take English lessons shortly after joining the school, 
whereas in other schools in China foreign languages are not 
taught until secondary level. 
  "As many of the parents are businessmen, our objective is to 
train their children to be the elite, and hope they can succeed 
them," Ms. Yang said. "It also fits our name -- Hero's China. 
In that sense, students have to develop a sense of belonging, 
awareness, independence and responsibility in the boarding 
school." 
  Those on the five-day residential course also learn 
independence, although there are 25 "family" teachers and 38 
nannies to take care of their daily needs. "Students have to 
clean their room, we won't help them," teacher Wang Oiwang said. 
  "Most of them have not done housework because they have been 
pampered since childhood. When they first arrive some even 
cried because they missed home. But they are happy now."

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765): "More Than 100 </F>
Mainland Newspapers Increases Pages and Issues From New Year's 
Day While Facing More Intense Competition"] 
  [Text] Beginning on New Year's Day 1994, another tide of 
increasing pages and issues swept across mainland newspapers. 
From Beijing to all localities, many newspapers increased the 
number of pages in each issue or increased the number of issues 
each month. A total of 150 newspapers all over the country took 
this action at the same time. 
  A few years ago, dozens of newspapers simultaneously 
increased the number of pages, and the action attracted 
extensive attention. Last year, another 130 newspapers joined 
the action to increase pages, and this was widely discussed by 
people. This time, as of New Year's Day, at least 150 
newspapers increased the number of pages or issues. In Beijing 
alone, 46 newspaper joined this round of expansion, which is the 
third such round. 
  In the new year, RENMIN RIBAO will be expanded to 12 pages 
each day, GONGREN RIBAO has expanded its Sunday issue to eight 
pages, FAZHI SHIBAO has been expanded to eight pages from four, 
BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO was changed into a daily, BEIJING WANBAO 
expanded to 16 pages, JINRONG SHIBAO expanded from four pages to 
eight pages, SHENZHEN SHANGBAO expanded to 12 pages, and 
CHANGJIANG RIBAO expanded to 12 pages after becoming an 8-page 
daily last year.... 
  What has prompted the newspapers to increase their pages? 
Market competition caused such changes. 
  At the end of 1991, a total of 1,543 newspapers were openly 
published. At the end of 1993, this had increased to 2,030. 
That is, a new newspaper was published every one and a half 
days last year. As education in China remains rather backward, 
there are still a considerable number of illiterates, and the 
number of newspaper readers is still limited, there are in fact 
too many newspapers in mainland China. This inevitably 
intensifies competition among the newspapers. As a result, 
competition exists in terms of quality, price, distribution, 
personnel, advertising, and business operations. By means of 
increasing pages, newspapers may offer more information and 
carry more advertisements. So this has become the major means 
of competition to attract readers. Therefore, newspapers have 
now become thicker with each issue, and some weeklies have 
become dailies. There is more substantial content, and the 
layouts have also become more attractive. 
  While increasing the number of pages and issues, many 
newspapers also complete printing and distribution earlier, and 
they have diversified their distribution channels in order to 
occupy a larger share of the market and to bring more 
convenience to their readers. More and more newspapers now bear 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, do not rely on 
government financial support, and do not depend on institutional 
subscribers using public funds to subscribe to newspapers. At 
present, more than 700 newspapers in the whole country have 
adopted laser composition and printing technology, and the 
newspaper advertising business is also developing rapidly. Last 
year, more than 10 newspapers earned over 100 million yuan in 
advertising income. 
  The newspaper management organ in the CPC Central Propaganda 
Department has pointed out some noticeable problems amid the 
rapid development of the press: Some newspapers have tried to 
seek a greater "market effect" by publishing "weekend editions" 
and increasing the number of pages, but they did not consider 
the social effects of publishing pictures and stories which were 
vulgar and in bad taste in order to attract readers. Some 
newspapers even reprinted materials from the overseas press in 
violation of the state's relevant regulations, thus causing a 
disorderly situation in the press. The concerned authorities 
have noticed these problems. 
  Of course, the increase in newspaper pages has inevitably 
led 
to higher prices. One year ago, 400 yuan a year could be used 
to subscribe to four to five newspapers, but the same amount can 
now be used to subscribe to only two newspapers. This year, 
newspaper prices will increase by 100 percent in the most 
extreme cases. Some experts predict that overall newspaper 
circulation will decrease sharply.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Chinese Women Enjoy Equal Say"] </F>
  [Text] A recent survey has found that most Chinese women 
now have equal standing with their husbands on family affairs. 
  This marks a substantial improvement in the status of women 
since the founding of New China in 1949. However, there still 
exists a profound imbalance between rural and urban women, 
researchers from the Institute of Population Studies reported at 
an international conference in Beijing last week. 
  The two-year survey was financed by the United Nations' 
Population Fund and conducted by social scientists under the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The study involved 11,200 
couples living in rural and urban areas in 10 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions. 
  The report stated that urban women and those in wealthier 
regions have marched further down the road to equality than 
their rural sisters. 
  Family income is increasingly under the control of women in 
urban areas, but the opposite is true in the countryside. 
  About 76 per cent of the urban couples manage their family 
incomes together. But women lead men by 6 per cent if one 
family member is overseeing the budget. 
  Rural couples who share responsibility account 81 per cent. 
But 4 per cent more men than women manage the income if only 
one person oversees finances. 
  Urban husbands and wives usually discuss major spending 
outlays together. The rate varies from 52 per cent to 67 per 
cent in buying products like washing machines or refrigerators. 
  However, on occasions when one side makes the decision, the 
person tends to be the husband. 
  The proportion of rural couples discussing expenditures 
ranged between 57 per cent and 73 per cent when buying farm 
animals or building a house. 
  Nearly 80 per cent of the couples in cities and 83 per cent 
in the countryside discuss whether to have a child. 
  The data seems to suggest the impending attainment of 
equality between Chinese women and men, the researchers said. 
<H5>  Optimistic </H5>
  However, since many sample families were located in the 
economically advanced regions, the results may be a little too 
optimistic, said Sha Jicai, head of the research group. 
  China has long been a male-dominated society. 
  According to centuries-old Confucian doctrines, women should 
unequivocally obey their husbands. 
  The researchers said their survey finds that modern women 
have far more lights and influence concerning their families 
than women during their mother's generation. 
  But the traditional roles of men and women are very much a 
part of their way of thinking. 
  Most parents expect their sons to receive better education 
and attend school longer than their daughters. 
  Nearly 73 per cent of women in cities and 81 per cent in the 
rural areas believe that wives should sacrifice for their 
husbands' success. 
  The survey found that men's average monthly income is 45 
yuan 
($5.20) higher than women's in cities where 80 per cent women 
earn between 100 and 300 yuan ($11.60-$34.50) monthly. 
Researchers said this might give men a slight advantage in 
family affairs. 
  The average urban male receives 10.75 years of education, 
almost a year longer than females. In the countryside, the gap 
is 1.15 years. 
  The research group conducted one-on-one interviews with 
5,500 
urban couples and 5,700 rural couples. These randomly sampled 
couples were scattered throughout the country. 
  Conditions were strictly dictated for the surveys. Spouses 
had to live together and wives had to be between the ages of 20 
and 54. All participants answered standardized questionnaires. 
  Questions concerned women's educations, marriages, incomes, 
jobs, family decision-making, childbirth and birth control, as 
well as their attitudes toward these issues.

  [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China and Germany 
should set their eyes on the 21st century and handle their 
mutual ties with a strategic point of view. 
  These remarks were made by Qiao Shi, chairman of China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, in an 
interview with a local correspondent, Babara Scheer, from the 
"Deutsche Welle" (the Voice of Germany) here this evening. 
  He said China and Germany have no fundamental conflict of 
interest, but shared many identical or similar views on 
international issues. 
  Their mutually supplementary economies have laid a good 
basis 
for bilateral cooperation, he said 
  Over the past few years, Qiao said due to the concerted 
efforts, bilateral ties have appeared a good momentum for 
development. 
  Political relations between the two countries have been 
growing closer and economic ties and trade progressing, he said. 
  During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's China visit last 
November, he said the two sides signed a series of agreements, 
contracts and letters of intent in the fields of politics, 
economy, science and technology and culture. 
  This demonstrates that the Sino-German ties have entered a 
new stage of the all-round development. 
  Qiao said China always places great importance on developing 
its ties with Germany and hopes for strengthening such 
cooperation in political, economic and other areas. 
  He said China is also willing to develop its long-term and 
stable relations with Germany according to the principles of 
seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual 
respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, 
equality and mutual benefit. 
  "We hope that Germany will play greater roles in 
international affairs with a view to maintaining the world peace 
and development. 
  "To conduct friendly cooperation between a reforming and 
opening up China and a unified and peace-loving Germany is not 
only in the interests of the two peoples, but also an important 
contribution to the world peace and development," he added. 
  Answering a question on what kind of hope that he will place 
on his current visit to Germany, Qiao said "I hope my visit will 
help deepen our mutual understanding, expand exchanges and 
strengthen cooperation so as to newly promote such ties." 
  At the correspondent's request, Qiao briefed him on the 
latest development of China's culture, economy and politics. 
  He said China will continue to deepen its reform and open 
the 
door wider, focusing on its economic construction as its major 
task. 
  Qiao stressed that China's policy of reform and opening up 
will remain unchanged because it has won a country-wide support 
and the people have got benefits from it.

  [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese legislator 
Qiao Shi today conferred with German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel on bilateral ties and international issues of common 
interest. 
  Qiao stressed that China and Germany, both important 
countries, should make contributions to the world. 
  He said China's reform is deepening. While acting strictly 
in accordance with its national conditions, China should also 
learn from experiences of various countries. 
  Qiao expressed his hope that Kinkel will make greater 
contributions to boosting bilateral ties. 
  He also appreciated Germany's consistent stand on "one 
China" 
policy. 
  Kinkel said the political relations between the two 
countries 
have been good, especially after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
visit to China. 
  China has always supported Germany's unification while the 
latter is also in favor of the stand on "one China", he said. 
  The German foreign minister noted that China is a country 
with vast territories and populous population, which is also a 
permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations. 
"It will play great roles in political field," he said. 
  Kinkel said as an industrialized country, Germany is 
interested in China with the highest economic growth rate in the 
globe. 
  He reaffirmed Germany's support for the restoration of 
China's status as a contracting party to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Qiao Shi thanked for Germany's support. 
  Qiao also met and had a friendly conversation with Hermann 
Otto Solms, chairman of the Parliamentary group of the Free 
Democratic Party here this afternoon. 
  Solms said all parties of the German Federal Assembly are 
pleased with Qiao's visit to Germany, hoping that the ties 
between the two governments, peoples and parliaments will be 
continuously strengthened.

  [Text] Bonn, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Both China and Germany 
should not only perceive with the 1990s of this century, but 
also look towards the next century in developing bilateral ties, 
a senior Chinese leader said here today. 
  Meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl here Thursday [20 
January] afternoon, Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, stressed 
that China should develop its relations with Germany from a 
strategic point of view. 
  "We desire to develop our long-term and stable friendly 
relations with Germany based on the principles of seeking common 
ground while reserving differences, mutual respect and trust, 
peace and mutual benefit," Qiao said. 
  Kohl said Germany and China share special ties, they can 
closely cooperate not only in economy, but also in other areas. 
  He said as China has a time-honored culture, bilateral 
cooperation can also be extended to science and technology. 
  "There is much that I am willing to do in this regard," Kohl 
said. 
  Both Qiao and Kohl shared a common view that a series of 
agreements signed between the two countries during Kohl's visit 
to China last November will be fully implemented. 
  Kohl said: "What we have promised will be surely abided by." 
  He stressed, "China has always supported Germany's 
reunification while Germany supported China's reunification in 
the past and will continue to do so in the future." 
  During the meeting, Qiao briefed Kohl on China's domestic 
situation and reforms. 
  "We hope for an early resumption of China's status as a 
signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT)", which will make China's economic relations with 
countries all over the world to take onto the normal way," Qiao 
said.

  [Text] Bonn, January 20 (XINHUA) -- A top Chinese 
legislator denied today the allegation that a great number of 
the Han nationality have moved to live in Tibet and that Tibet's 
national customs and religious belief have been abolished. 
  Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National People's 
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, made these remarks at a 
meeting here with Hans Sterken, chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the German Federal Assembly. 
  He said there are a total of 56 nationalities in China. 
Those minority nationalities are practicing national autonomy 
according to their own actual conditions. 
  Qiao added that Tibet has for many years exercised national 
autonomy. 
  For a long time, it had a population of only one million and 
now its population rises to two million-odd of which 96 percent 
belong to Tibet nationalities. "So there does not exist such a 
problem that a great number of the Han nationality have 
emigrated to Tibet," he said. 
  On China's labor force, Qiao said it is inevitable and 
reasonable that during the socialist transitional period, there 
exists the flow of labor force. 
  He expressed the belief that such kind of situation will be 
eased after many enterprises run by townships and villages in 
the rural areas have sprung up. 
  During the meeting Qiao also exchanged views with Sterken on 
international situation and bilateral ties, reaffirming that 
China's foreign policy is consistent. 
  Today Qiao also met on the separate occasions with 
Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the parliamentary group of the 
Social Democratic Party, and Ludwig Glos, first vice-chairman of 
the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union -- the 
Christian Social Union.

of Sino-British Relations Will Unavoidably Affect Economic 
Interests"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu indicated that Guangzhou's 
large-scale construction projects will be open for tender by 
foreign companies on the basis of the principle of fairness. 
However, the authorities will also take into consideration the 
political background of the relevant foreign companies, and 
those which attempt to impair the interests of our country will 
not be welcome. 
  Li Ziliu noted at a public occasion in Macao that after 
China 
and France have resumed normal diplomatic relations, French 
companies can join the others in tendering for all construction 
projects in Guangzhou on the basis of mutual benefits and 
equality. However, French companies missed many opportunities 
during the initial stage of Guangzhou's subway construction. 
Now, they are mainly engaged in software projects. 
  Li Ziliu added: Generally speaking, Guangzhou is mainly 
concerned with the real strength of the companies concerned when 
assessing their tenders. However, "if Sino-British relations 
continue to deteriorate, the economic interests of both sides 
will unavoidably suffer losses," he indicated.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 21 (AFP)--China urged foreign 
reporters in Hong Kong on Friday [21 January] not to show a 
controversial British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) documentary about 
the life of Chairman Mao Zedong at their club on Monday. But 
the board of governors of the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) 
said they would go ahead with Monday's screening of "Mao Zedong: 
The Last Emperor" -- and also ignore an unusual Hong Kong 
government request that they secure a permit for the 
members-only event. 
  FCC Vice President Carl Goldstein said China's demand was 
presented to the board by two officials of the foreign affairs 
department of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, 
Beijing's de facto consulate in the British colony. "We have 
come to express our hope -- that is, to make a request that the 
FCC takes measures to stop the showing of this film," Goldstein 
quoted one of the officials as saying. "It villifies and 
slanders our late chairman and hurts the feelings of the Chinese 
people." 
  FCC President Philip Bowring responded that the club's 
decision to organize the screening was not a judgement of the 
documentary's accuracy. Goldstein added that XINHUA was welcome 
to send a representative to the screening to give China's 
opinion. The officials took note of the offer but were 
otherwise non-committal, he said. 
  On Wednesday, the Hong Kong Government's Television and 
Entertainment Licensing Authority got involved, telling the FCC 
by fax that it must get a permit before the showing. It has 
never before made such a demand for FCC film or video 
screenings, and Goldstein said the club would send a letter back 
saying the requirement would be ignored. 
  Ironically, the authority's demand came the same week 
Governor Chris Patten told a US press rights group, the Freedom 
Forum, that his administration would fight "uphill and down 
dale" for press freedoms ahead of Hong Kong's return to China in 
1997. 
  Last month Beijing unsuccessfully put diplomatic pressure on 
London to block the original British telecast of the 
documentary, produced on the centenary of his birth, which 
alleged that in his later years he consorted with young women. 
Sino-British relations are already at a low point over Patten's 
decision to press ahead with electoral reforms aimed at 
extending local democracy ahead of 1997. 
  Hong Kong's biggest television station, Television 
Broadcasts 
Ltd., has acquired rights to the documentary, but has yet to say 
when it will air it. The video was already shown to about 50 
local democracy activists at a private screening last weekend, 
with permission from the television authority.

<F P=106> [By Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten left Hong Kong last night for 
London, taking a parting swipe at China's conduct in the row 
over the territory's political and economic future. Intending 
to conduct strategy talks in London with British Prime Minister 
John Major and senior cabinet ministers, Mr Patten reiterated a 
stern warning to China not to mix politics and economics. 
  He intimated China might have more to lose than Britain if 
it 
did so. "China has pretty well a two-to-one trade surplus with 
the United Kingdom," Mr Patten said. "China has attempted to 
join the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), an 
application which has the United Kingdom's and, of course, the 
Hong Kong Government's enthusiastic support. And countries 
which join Gatt don't behave in the sort of way that has been 
suggested by one or two Chinese officials." 
  Since the Sino-British negotiations broke down, Mr Patten's 
relations with Beijing have been strained and acrimonious. 
  Britain has now embarked on unilateral constitutional reform 
in Hong Kong, but he stressed that the door to negotiations on 
the contentious issues surrounding the final elections under 
British rule was still open. With the first part of his 
constitutional reform package now before the legislature Mr 
Patten has made it clear the remainder will not be introduced 
until after that bill is approved. The bill needs to be 
approved by the end of the month, leaving the way clear for the 
remainder of the constitutional reform package to be introduced 
in March. 
  Mr Patten will seek cabinet backing to take this course of 
action when he meets senior ministers in London on Monday. "I 
don't think you should expect any dramatic announcements," he 
said. "The position is one I think the community well 
understands. We want to go on talking to Chinese officials 
about the three outstanding contentious issues (surrounding the 
1995 Legislative Council elections). "We're happy to go on 
talking until that moment when we have to begin legislating on 
the remaining matters which have to be resolved for the 1995 
elections. We hope that the talks can be resumed, and if that's 
not the case we will have to try with the Legislative Council to 
put in place arrangements which are acceptable to Hong Kong," Mr 
Patten said. 
  Today, he will begin his strategy talks with the British 
Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, and the minister 
responsible for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad.

<F P=106> [By Sue Green] </F>
  [Text] Fleet Street dubbed them the two generals: the 
tall, tough northerner who strode about London coatless in the 
cold, masterminding Labour's doomed election campaign, and the 
Tory campaign chief who won the war but lost the battle, failing 
to keep his own seat as his party regained power. 
  Now, in a twist of fate, those two men are on the same side, 
pushing the Hong Kong democracy barrow. 
  The Labour man, Dr Jack Cunningham, a scientist-turned 
politician, is Britain's shadow foreign secretary, in Beijing 
this week to tell China his party won't be taking its side 
against the British Government. 
  And the man he is lining up with, whose roof he slept under 
in Hong Kong, is none other than his old campaign foe, now the 
territory's Governor, Chris Patten. 
  "Someone asked me a very funny question at dinner the other 
night," says Dr Cunningham in his broad Geordie [northeastern] 
accent. "If Labour had won the election but I'd lost my seat 
would I be Governor of Hong Kong?" 
  He doesn't know the answer. And, strictly speaking, he 
cannot say for sure whether Labour will keep the present 
government's Hong Kong policy--and its choice of Governor--if it 
wins the British election due before 1997. But he thinks it 
unwise to dump either, and unlikely: "It's difficult to 
conceive of wiping the slate clean and starting again, 
especially if it's 1996," Dr Cunningham says. "A Labour 
Government in the future is not something I can make 
declarations about now but, speaking personally, my commitment 
is to these proposals and it is difficult to conceive of 
circumstances in which we would throw the whole lot out. And, 
for my own part, I don't think it would be sensible for us to 
come in and remove the Governor, put someone else in." 
  Dr Cunningham says a member of Mr Patten's family was amazed 
to hear him saying nice things about the Governor in a 
television interview: "I said yes, you wouldn't have seen me 
doing that two years ago." But two years is a long time in 
politics and Dr Cunningham, who represents Copeland in Cumbria 
and has been a member of parliament for 23 of his 54 years, is 
well accustomed to a system in which your former foes become 
your hosts. He and Mr Patten previously crossed swords when Mr 
Patten was environment secretary and he was Labour's spokesman. 
He sees their present roles as a curious twist of history. 
  He is quick to dismiss the notion that Mr Patten's high Hong 
Kong profile may be aimed at furthering his political future 
back home. He says a total breakdown of the China-Britain talks 
on Hong Kong, withdrawal of Mr Patten's reform package, 
undermining both him and Prime Minister John Major--perhaps 
fatally wounding the government-- would not be a good result for 
Labour. "The outcome of that is a Labour Government that has to 
resolve this problem and I don't think you can do that just by 
taking China's side," he says. 
  In fact, contrary to speculation that Chinese Embassy 
lobbying of MPs in London may be weakening support for Mr 
Patten's reforms, Dr Cunningham has made it clear to China he 
will not be backing it against the Tories. Asked if he had been 
lobbied in London, where he has met Chinese Ambassador Ma Yuzhen 
and Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, he said: "Not overtly," 
then added, "no, that's not quite true." China's view during 
those talks was that the Patten plan should be withdrawn. "I 
think they hoped we would come to that point of view but we did 
not and we have not and nothing that happened in Peking 
(Beijing) would lead me to recommend that course of action to my 
colleagues in London. "I regard the proposals as very modest. 
It is a bit difficult to concede that this is some huge gulf 
that cannot be bridged." 
  So, what achievements from his three days in Beijing, his 
first visit, does he have to report at today's shadow Cabinet 
meeting? Dr Cunningham says he learned a lot (references to his 
meetings with "Mr Rongji" at his Friday press conference showed 
there was definite scope to expand his knowledge of China) but 
says he did not know before he went why the Sino-British talks 
broke down; and he still does not know. 
  Those he met in China included Vice-President Li Lanqing, 
Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and director of the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping. He has asked them to explain, 
in writing just how the Patten plan conflicts with the Basic Law 
and what amendments they want. "I just wanted to try to get a 
clearer understanding of the Chinese reasons for this stand over 
Hong Kong, the breakdown, and to make sure the Chinese were 
absolutely clear about my position and that of the British 
Labour Party, and to establish good personal relationships and 
contacts." 
  As a long-time politician, strategist, and media performer, 
Dr Cunningham could hardly be dubbed a straight talker. But he 
is willing to be blunt where it seems due. Like Mr Patten, he 
sees a conflict in the Chinese position: President Jiang Zemin 
says trade and politics should remain separate, yet China is 
dragging the airport issue into its political negotiations over 
Hong Kong. 
  To allow this standoff to lead to a series of protracted 
economic and trade disputes would be "pretty silly" he says. 
The end result? "A series of self-inflicted wounds." And while 
he says it is never too late to take up the issue of Hong Kong 
democratic rights, he concedes that should have been done years 
ago. 
  But to be fair, it was not just that British Governments did 
not take the initiative--the incentive to do so in Hong Kong was 
also lacking: "There's little doubt the approach of 1997 was 
the single biggest stimulus," he says. 
  It is not certain Dr Cunningham would become Foreign 
Secretary in a future Labour Government. He was given the 
shadow post despite coming just 12th out of 18 in the shadow 
cabinet poll. But he is a strong supporter of the Labour Leader 
John Smith and obviously has hopes of getting the job "if I was 
lucky enough to," he says. 
  If his entry in Who's Who is any sort of litmus test, Dr 
Cunningham has at least one qualification for taking a key role 
in the resolution of Hong Kong's future: Along with fly 
fishing, fell walking, and folk music, his hobbies include 
"listening to other people's opinions".

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Person Who Undermines Cooperation Must </F>
Bear Blame"] 
  [Text] Chris Patten's mood may be worse during his current 
trip to Britain for consultations, because the situation has 
changed, the international environment has become unfavorable to 
him, and so has the domestic situation in Britain. British 
business circles are no longer concerned about whether his 
constitutional reform package will be passed by the Legislative 
Council, and they have noted that his unilateral legislation was 
an erroneous action. His countrymen asked him to make it plain 
how the trade interests of British business would be harmed and 
whether British-Chinese relations would turn for the better 
after the talks on the Hong Kong issue broke down. 
  Therefore, this time, Patten was in no mood to put on 
"political shows" by appearing on British television or 
arranging interviews with British newspapers; instead, he 
hastily consulted some "China hands" about countermeasures, and 
tried to cope with the huge pressures from the British business 
community. He discussed ways to deal with the Chinese with 
former foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, and discussed how to 
handle the deadlocked situation after the breakdown of talks 
with Ambassador McLaren and Foreign Minister Goodlad. 
  When he was appointed Hong Kong governor and was on his way 
to take office in Hong Kong, he vowed to maintain good relations 
with China in front of some British businessmen who supported 
his appointment. He said that he would build up trust with his 
Chinese counterparts and would be able to solve many issues by 
just dialing the phone. He meant that as Britain had appointed 
such an able Hong Kong governor, British businessmen would gain 
favor everywhere in their China trade. 
  However, all people have seen that he behaved in an 
extremely 
irresponsible way by challenging the established agreements 
between China and Britain, refusing to make things converge with 
the Basic Law, and recklessly bringing part of the controversial 
constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council before 
an agreement had been reached, and all this was unnecessary. 
Patten ruined all of the progress that had been made in the 
past and caused the breakdown of the talks without regard to the 
interests of the residents of Hong Kong and the interests of 
British businessmen. He simply made a mess of the situation and 
broke the promises he made when he took office. 
  Therefore, at a hearing in the British Parliament, David 
Howell and other Conservative MP's questioned him about whether 
he had expected the strong reaction of the Chinese side, what 
had caused the current deadlock in Sino-British relations, and 
whether Patten formulated China policy and had forced the 
British Government to adopt it, or, would he, as Hong Kong 
governor, obey the British Government. Patten still stubbornly 
fought with his back to the wall. He did not dare to speak 
clearly, and just said that "the British Government supports my 
constitutional reform package." It seems that his superiors are 
only able to support a subordinate and do not have the power to 
correct what the subordinate has done. Such an arrogant attitude 
will only arouse strong criticism from the British business 
community. 
  At the hearing, Patten still tried to conceal faults and 
gloss over wrongs and to deceive the British public. He said 
that he did not know about any agreement between China and 
Britain in 1990 at all, because when he consulted Percy Craddock 
about constitutional reforms, Craddock did not tell him that an 
agreement had been reached on electoral arrangements, so he did 
not have to worry about that. All people in Hong Kong have long 
known about the seven letters exchanged between the Chinese and 
British foreign ministers, and Chinese officials also told him 
that the seven letters represented an agreement, but he still 
declared in a session of the Legislation Council's that he 
"would not recognize any secret agreements" and "would not 
create any more secret agreements." The deadlocked situation 
was created by him deliberately, and he is trying to shirk all 
his responsibilities. 
  Now, Western countries, including the United States, Japan, 
Germany, and France, are all vying with each other to march into 
the Chinese market. Will Britain still allow Patten to continue 
his blunders and harm British-Chinese relations? 
  Even the Labor Party's Allan Rogers also said that the 
Conservative cabinet should bear the responsibility for the 
worsening of British-Chinese relations. 
  The parliamentary hearing enabled British voters to clearly 
see who has caused the worsening of British-Chinese relations. 
It is Chris Patten who should bear responsibility for the 
current situation. John Major is now bogged down in a 
predicament, and does not want to be blamed for the worsening of 
British-Chinese relations. Therefore, on the one hand, the 
Conservative Party summoned Patten to give a testimony; on the 
other hand, it has again dispatched McLaren back to Beijing to 
deal the deadlocked situation left to him by Christopher Hum and 
to sound out China's reaction. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin explicitly 
replied to the British side: The Chinese side hopes that the 
British side will withdraw the partial constitutional reform 
package that has been submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative 
Council for deliberation and returns to the negotiating table. 
"If the British side refuses to withdraw it and brings the 
second part of the constitutional reform package to the 
Legislative Council for deliberation, then this will further 
show that the British side is determined not to return to the 
negotiating table, and that the British side will thus have to 
bear responsibility for all consequences." "The Chinese side 
will not accept any legislative decision on the 1994-95 
elections made by the Legislative Council, and all institutions 
formed according to such decisions will only be able to function 
up until 30 June 1997." 
  The position of the Chinese side is firm, and the British 
side should carefully weigh up the consequent gains and losses, 
restrain Patten's confrontational policy, and remove obstacles 
to Sino- British cooperation.

"Who Is Harming Hong Kong's Freedom of the Press?"] 
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten made a speech on a public 
occasion the day before yesterday and talked a lot about 
so-called freedom of the press. He urged Hong Kong's media not 
to exercise "self-censorship," to bravely stand up and "strive 
to uphold a free press after 1997," and not to allow Hong Kong's 
freedom of the press and "the regional oasis to be infringed 
upon." To people in journalism circles, there is nothing new 
about this provocative speech, because recently Chris Patten and 
high-ranking officials of the Hong Kong Government have 
redoubled their "concern" for the media of Hong Kong and have 
constantly repeated such views together with some strange inside 
stories. Journalism circles have heard them for some time. 
<H3>  Exerting Pressure on the Media With the Theory of 
"Self-Examination" </H3>
  Although Chris Patten did not begin his life as a 
journalist, 
he seems to have a special liking for journalism. Evidently, 
the idea of "self-censorship" has come from his so-called 
"observation" of the media. During recent meetings with guests 
and in interviews, Chris Patten has often elaborated on his own 
initiative on the idea of "self-censorship." He holds that all 
media in Hong Kong have knelt before Beijing, and, therefore, 
the Hong Kong Government should deliver the media from its 
extreme misery and would "tramp over hill and dale" to defend 
the freedom of the press. In an interview by a reporter from a 
certain Hong Kong newspaper on 4 January, Chris Patten said that 
the Hong Kong Government "will not abuse the existing 
regulations and laws to hamper freedom of speech or freedom of 
the press," but will "study laws which may be abused and revise 
them." He implied that existing laws will be further relaxed. 
Chris Patten said encouragingly: "If the Journalists 
Association and other organizations make proposals, I am willing 
to take an active part in the debate." 
  With the governor leading the way, high-ranking officials 
have followed closely. A column disclosed that, by order of the 
governor, newly appointed Chief Secretary Anson Chan selectively 
feted people in charge of some newspapers at the beginning of 
this month. At the banquet, Mrs. Chan asked the chief editors 
if they felt any pressure from the Chinese side. "Is 
self-censorship very serious?" This implied that 
"self-examination" was the reason why chief editors did not 
support Chris Patten's proposals on constitutional reform. 
Unexpectedly, such "instructive remarks" caused resentment 
among the chief editors. They held that newspapers regarded 
serving their readers as their purpose and that there was no 
such thing as "self-examination." The column said that the 
chief editors expressed their resentment to her and greatly 
embarrassed her. 
  Chris Patten has always thought nothing of the Chinese 
newspapers in Hong Kong. Moreover, most Chinese newspapers in 
Hong Kong take a critical attitude toward Chris Patten on the 
constitutional issue. This has increased the governor's aversion 
to the Hong Kong media. Whenever there is any important 
information, Chris Patten is more willing to provide it to the 
media of his own country. The chief secretary meant to help the 
governor "pay attention to the so-called issue of 
`self-censorship.'" It turned out that the conversation was 
disagreeable and ended in embarrassment. 
  It is really difficult to explain why Chris Patten and high- 
ranking officials in the Hong Kong Government have shown their 
"concern" for freedom of the press in Hong Kong so frequently. 
It is as if the media were being seriously repressed and they 
were the only people who could relieve the media of their 
sufferings. This kind of unaccountable "attention" has caused 
uneasiness even among the media, which has seldom taken a 
critical attitude toward the British Hong Kong Government. 
According to a commentary carried by a Hong Kong newspaper, 
Chris Patten "often tells the British press that everyone in 
journalism circles in Hong Kong exercises self- discipline, and 
all the media have carried out self-examination and have 
automatically knelt down to Beijing." If one reads British 
newspapers, one can often come across this kind of article. 
After reading such articles, readers who have no idea about the 
situation may believe that journalists in Hong Kong keep their 
mouths shut and are out of the game. Such an image does great 
harm to journalism in Hong Kong. 
  This side stubbornly wants the media to admit to exercising 
"self-censorship" and the other side has already taken 
corresponding action. This is good coordination indeed. 
Recently, the so-called "Publishers Association," whose 
membership mainly consists of foreigners and which does not have 
much influence on journalism circles, issued a "Code of Conduct 
for Publishers" to some media organizations and asked them to 
jointly sign the code. It is said that one of the main contents 
of the code is to set up a "Publishers' Code of Conduct 
Committee," similar to the "press council," which would be in 
charge of criticizing, guiding, and assessing the contents of 
publications in Hong Kong. Keen observers have pointed out 
that, outwardly, the committee does not have the legal right of 
censorship, but in reality, the influence of public opinion on 
journalism circles is used to exert pressure. It is known 
through hearsay that a certain female member of the Legislative 
Council is promoting this work from behind the scenes. I 
remember that someone made a proposal to establish a press 
council in the past, but his proposal met with strong opposition 
among the majority of journalists. At present, the abnormal 
move by this organization, which is against the will of the 
majority of journalists, is echoing the governor's 
"self-censorship" theory in such a way that it has raised 
doubts. This is clearly a measure to restrict the press. Why 
should the label of "defending the freedom of the press" be 
stuck to it! 
  According to reports, this move has been positively 
responded 
to by an "enthusiastic" media organization which is favored by 
the governor. Recently, the organization published a quarterly, 
which regularly comments on various newspapers. Its contents 
included "a search for some contributed articles which have been 
modified, examined, or rejected, and the disclosure of inside 
stories behind this `information.'" The modification, 
examination, acceptance, and rejection of contributed articles 
are entirely normal procedures in the internal operations of 
press organs and are the normal duties of journalists at 
different levels. If people have to worry that even such 
operations and performance of their duties will be scrutinized, 
disclosed, and castigated in "black and white," what freedom of 
the press can people talk about! 
  At the same time, the British Hong Kong Government has also 
made full use of the electronic media and has professed on many 
occasions that it will revise the relevant restrictions on 
foreign corporations's purchase of Hong Kong media and will 
issue more satellite television licenses to western media in 
order to build Hong Kong into the so-called "satellite 
broadcasting center of Asia" and further internationalize the 
media in Hong Kong. 
<H5>  The Aim Is To Sow Discord and Split the People of Hong Kong </H5>
  We all know that Hong Kong is a pluralistic commercial 
society and that market orientation is, after all, an important 
factor for the media to consider. The media has the right to 
select what should or should not be published or broadcast. 
This should be part of the freedom of the press. What is 
difficult to understand is that the British Hong Kong 
authorities, which repeatedly talk about the freedom of the 
press, do not match their words with their deeds, thinking one 
way and behaving in another. Some changes in stock ownership 
took place in an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, which 
in the past was regarded as the mouthpiece of the British Hong 
Kong Government. Chris Patten paid great attention to this 
change! This is a distortion of the freedom of the press rather 
than defending the freedom of the press! 
  Another example is that, last year, a reporter from a Hong 
Kong radio station was discriminated against by Mike Hanson, the 
Hong Kong governor's information coordinator, during an 
interview in the United States. The reporter argued strongly on 
just grounds. Mike Hanson went so far as to say threateningly 
that if the reporter did not behave properly, he would not be 
accredited by the Hong Kong Government in future news coverage. 
The radio station lodged a complaint with the governor and the 
matter ended up with nothing definite. Do people not often see 
incidents of wanton attacks and accusations, including by Chris 
Patten, or threats and lures with promises of gain, toward media 
which dare to take a critical attitude on Chris Patten? Is it 
not ridiculous for people who treat the media in this way to 
talk about defending freedom of the press! 
  Besides, resorting to the method of stealthily substituting 
one thing for another and doing scissors-and-paste work, the 
British BBC edited and broadcast "Mao Zedong, the Last Emperor," 
which slandered Mao Zedong. Such a trick did not conform to 
journalistic ethics and seriously hurt the feelings of the 
Chinese people. It was only right for the Chinese Government to 
lodge a protest. Television stations in Hong Kong did not 
broadcast the film. It can be said that they made a wise 
decision. However, Chris Patten, some members of the 
Legislative Council, and a few so-called personalities of the 
democratic movement who oppose the Chinese Government were 
greatly disappointed. They openly or secretly exerted pressure 
on the television stations. Chris Patten even publicly incited 
people and said he was waiting to see "whether or not it will be 
broadcast." In this way, he exerted pressure on the media. Some 
people even wanted to hold demonstrations because of this. Does 
it mean that Hong Kong has no freedom of the press if a 
television program made in a despicable way is not shown? On 
the other hand, only a small proportion of the dirty scandals 
made public by the media in foreign countries about the British 
royal family and cabinet members, who behave like thieves and 
whores, are published or broadcast by the media in Hong Kong. 
Has Hong Kong not lost all of its freedom of the press 
according to their logic? Why is it necessary for Chris Patten 
to "defend" it at all today! 
  The British Hong Kong authorities, which regard themselves 
as 
the apologists of freedom, have also linked freedom of the press 
with 1997, implying that there will not be freedom of the press 
in Hong Kong after 1997. Such incitation is even more 
ridiculous. Ensuring freedom of speech and freedom of the press 
in Hong Kong is an important factor for Hong Kong in practicing 
one country, two systems after 1997. This is clearly stated in 
Article 27 of the Basic Law. How come Chris Patten, who claims 
to have read the Basic Law more often than the Bible, is 
ignorant of this? 
  British colonial rule has always included stringent controls 
over the media. If one reads modern history about British 
colonies, one will find that it is full of the despicable 
records of notorious Britain. When were people under colonial 
rule given true "freedom of the press?" At present, Chris 
Patten has changed his normal behavior and has started showing 
"concern" for the freedom of the press. However, such 
performances has caused aversion and resentment among people of 
insight in journalism circles. They are worried that amid cries 
of "the wolves are coming," freedom of the press in Hong Kong is 
being infringed upon and trampled on by thieves crying "stop 
thief." Talking about "self-censorship," trying to "making 
comments on" the press, or relaxing relevant policies are 
nothing but attempts to coerce with the remnant powers of the 
colonial rule to continue and strengthen controls over the 
media. On the other hand, they are attempts to sow discords, to 
bring about splits and confrontations among the people of Hong 
Kong, to sow discord between the media and the Chinese side, and 
to fan feelings of confrontation. The prerequisite of all this 
is to shake and damage the objective and neutral position of the 
media. It is not difficult to see clearly whether Chris Patten 
is defending or damaging freedom of the press in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Chang Shao-wei (1728 </F>
1421 1218): "Lu Ping Warns That if Chris Patten Tables Second 
Part of Constitutional Reform Package, Sino-British Talks Will 
Break Down Completely"] 
  [Text] Today, Lu Ping, director of the State Council's 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has said that if Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten brings the second part of his 
constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council, this 
will cause the Sino-British talks to break down completely. 
  He also blamed Patten for violating the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the airport project and delaying the airport's 
construction. 
  Lu Ping arrived in Shenzhen today and joined members of the 
economic group of the Preliminary Working Committee in 
inspecting traffic conditions at the border point in Shenzhen. 
When answering reporters' questions, Lu Ping said that if Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten discusses with the British Government 
when to bring the second part of the constitutional reform 
package to the Legislative Council, this would cause talks to 
break down completely and the talks would never be reopened. 
  On the airport issue, he said that Patten had blamed the 
Chinese side for delaying the settlement of the airport issue; 
in fact, the British side should bear all the blame for such a 
delay. As long as the British side returns to the path of the 
Memorandum of Understanding at an early date, the airport issue 
will be solved instantly. Now, the problem is that Patten has 
completely violated the Memorandum of Understanding on the 
airport project, so the blame for the delay can only be put on 
the British side.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Beijing Decides on Its Policy Toward </F>
Taiwan: Not Anxious To Seek Reunification"] 
  [Text] After a comprehensive assessment of Taiwan's 
political situation, the mainland has decided on its policy 
toward Taiwan, and has defined the following three principles -- 
insisting on one China, denying international political space to 
Taiwan, and refusing to make the commitment of not using force 
against Taiwan. Under these three principles the mainland's 
overall policy toward Taiwan this year will be -- holding it 
back economically, pushing it down militarily, and restricting 
its space internationally. As to reunification, the mainland 
can take its time. When the economy on the mainland is 
developed or even surpasses that of Taiwan in 30 to 40 years, 
that will be the right time for a trial of strength. 
  The mainland's new policy toward Taiwan was discussed and 
determined at the national meeting of directors of Taiwan 
affairs offices held in Xiamen in December. At the meeting, 
participants summed up the year's work toward Taiwan performed 
by the Office for Taiwan Affairs and its affiliated departments 
and studied the work for further pushing forward the development 
of relations across the Taiwan Strait. Qian Qichen, deputy head 
of Taiwan Working Group of the CPC Central Committee and vice 
premier of the State Council, and Wang Zhaoguo, director of the 
Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, delivered important speeches 
at the meeting. Their speeches, together with mainland's 
assessment of the Taiwan situation and the work orientation 
toward Taiwan in the new year, were collated into a document and 
transmitted to the Taiwan affairs offices in various localities 
level by level. 
  The document covers several issues, including Taiwan's 
political situation, Taiwan's foreign activities, the assessment 
of the situation across the strait, the work toward Taiwan, and 
so on. In the area of Taiwan's political situation, the 
mainland holds that since last year, political developments in 
Taiwan have added some unfavorable factors to the reunification 
of the motherland. This development is manifested in: 1) the 
Taiwanization of the Kuomintang [KMT]; 2) the consolidation of 
Li Teng-hui's position; 3) the development of the strength of 
the KMT, the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP], the New Party, 
personalities of no party affiliation, and so on; and 4) the 
increase of the DPP's strength. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: The future situation across the 
strait is highly variable along with the completion of the KMT's 
Taiwanization process and the fulfillment of its reform program 
at this stage. Originally, the CPC placed the hope of achieving 
the cause of reunification on the Taiwan authorities, but this 
should be changed now. We must place more hopes on the Taiwan 
people rather than on the Taiwan authorities. 
  In the analysis of Taiwan's foreign activities, the CPC must 
stick to the stand regarding Taiwan's international space for 
survival. That is, it is permissible for Taiwan to engage in 
economic activities, but Taiwan must be completely excluded from 
any political activities. In assessing Taiwan's attempt to 
reenter the UN last year, the document stated that "the CPC won 
the struggle against Taiwan's entry into the UN," which 
indicated that the CPC had a good grasp of Taiwan's strategy in 
its analyses. Taiwan intended to rope the Central and South 
American countries in with money. Actually, it did not exert 
good effects, nor did it yield remarkable results, as some 
countries accepted its money on one hand and revealed its doing 
to the mainland on the other. 
  The document mentioned that the talk between the CPC's 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in 
Seattle last November meant that the Sino-U.S. relationship had 
come out of the blind alley since the 4 June Incident, which 
would have a bearing on the mainland's future work toward 
Taiwan. Jiang Zemin told Mr. Clinton that China insists on the 
stand of one China, and that Taiwan cannot act as a political 
entity, only as an economic entity. The document stressed: The 
CPC will definitely insist that "there is only one China in the 
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China" as stated in 
the White Paper on Taiwan. 
  According to the comprehensive analysis of the document, 
although the situation in Taiwan this year is more complicated 
than last year, and the CPC is particularly worried about the 
adoption of the direct polls for presidential election and the 
voting law for the people, still there are some favorable 
factors to the development of relations across the strait as a 
whole. These are: The economic growth on the mainland gathered 
pace, the CPC's foreign environment took a turn for the better, 
there were louder and louder voices for "peaceful contacts" 
between the island and the mainland, Taiwan's attitude toward 
the "three exchanges" was a bit relaxed, and the "Ku-Wang talks" 
were a success. 
  Besides, Wang Zhaoguo pointed out at the meeting of the 
Taiwan affairs office directors: It is necessary to further 
step up preparations in various aspects regarding the work 
toward Taiwan in the new year, particularly the work toward the 
mainstream faction headed by Li Teng-hui. We will absolutely 
make no concessions on the issue of the three principles -- 
insisting on one China, denying international political space to 
Taiwan, and refusing give up the use of force. At present, the 
conditions of immediately working for political contacts and 
"three exchanges" between the two sides of the strait do not 
exist. Therefore, what can be done is to hold Taiwan up 
economically, improve the mainland's investment climate for 
Taiwan investors, make practical preparations for the "three 
exchanges," and hold routine discussions to implement the 
"Ku-Wang talks." Meanwhile, it is necessary to push Taiwan down 
economically while restricting its space internationally.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- The threat to the 
Republic of China [ROC]'s security is unabated, although 
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are 
warming, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said in a recent 
interview with the London-based JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY. 
  "The Chinese Communists are aggressively building up their 
arsenals and have never renounced their intent on the use of 
force against Taiwan," Chien said in an interview carried in the 
weekly's Jan. 22 issue released Thursday [20 January]. 
  Beijing's unwillingness to renounce military action against 
Taiwan provides the rationale for Taipei's continued need of a 
strong deterrent capability, Chien noted. 
  He also pointed out that Beijing's constant suppression of 
the ROC's international activities and its attempt to stop the 
world community from selling defensive weapons to Taiwan have 
pushed many Taiwan residents to lean more and more towards a 
total break in relations with the mainland. 
  "The Chinese Communist regime has since its inception gone 
all out to suppress and squeeze US out of the international 
community," Chien said. "Ever since we declared our intention to 
participate in the United Nations, Beijing has become even more 
adamant in its attempts to downgrade our status and evade 
reality." 
  Chien stressed that the ROC Government will dedicate all its 
efforts to expand room for diplomatic maneuver and build up 
friendly support in the international community. 
  "We will also, in coordination with our mainland policy, 
urge 
the Chinese Communists to squarely face the objective fact that 
the nation is divided and ruled by two different governments, 
and that we must support each other in the international arena 
while working together for reunification," Chien noted. 
  Prior to national reunification, Chien said, the basic 
rights 
of the 20.8 million ROC citizens should not be ignored. 
  He said the ROC has launched a campaign to end its long 
stretch of international isolation. Key elements of this drive 
include efforts to gain membership to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, the United Nations and the ASEAN regional 
forum. 
  Chien further pointed out that Beijing's staunch opposition 
to the political reforms package brought out by Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten clearly shows that the Chinese Communists 
will not allow Hong Kong people to enjoy full political freedom 
after 1997. 
  "Therefore we firmly believe that Beijing's `One Country, 
Two 
Systems' policy towards Hong Kong should never be carried out 
here, nor should such a policy ever be taken as the model for 
China's reunification," Chien added.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan investors are 
welcome to explore the insurance market in Mainland China, a 
senior mainland insurance executive said here Thursday [20 
January]. 
  Li Yumin, president of Mainland China's insurance 
association, made the remark upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek 
International Airport. Li led a 20-member delegation to Taiwan 
for a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait insurance cooperation. 
  The mainland's insurance market is expected to be 
liberalized 
after Mainland China becomes a member of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Li noted, adding that prospects for 
the mainland insurance industry are good. 
  At present, there are no Taiwan investments in the 
mainland's 
insurance industry, while more than 30 foreign insurance 
companies have established representative offices in Mainland 
China, he pointed out. 
  Li, also chairman of the People's Insurance Company of 
China, 
and his 20-member mainland delegation will attend the 
cross-strait insurance forum January 22-25 at the Grand Hyatt 
Taipei. 
  The three-day forum will be the second of its kind. The 
first was held in Beijing and Shanghai in September 1992. 
[separate sessions were held in those cities] 
  Sponsored by the National Insurance Institute, the forum 
will 
focus on insurance rules and regulations, future trends, and the 
division of social and business insurance.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- French arms sales to 
Taiwan help ensure the security of the Asia-Pacific region, 
former French Defense Minister Pierre Joke said in Taipei 
Wednesday [19 January]. 
  Joke, currently president of the Revenue Court of France, 
said previous decisions to sell arms to Taiwan were natural and 
necessary decisions. 
  The French Government approved the sale of Lafayette-class 
frigates and Mirage fighter planes to Taiwan during Joke's 
service as defense minister. 
  Joke noted that when the French Government approved the arms 
deal, it knew that it would be a long-term cooperation project. 
  Joke also said that when the Francois Mitterrand government 
was weighing the possibilities of selling arms to Taiwan, he 
submitted a report to Mitterrand based on his experience in the 
Air Force. 
  He explained that the arms sale would not just include one 
purchase, but also follow-up purchases and parts maintenance, 
which require long-term cooperation. 
  He said that there is still plenty of room for Taipei-Paris 
cooperation, especially in culture and trade. 
  Joke arrived here last Saturday. He will leave on Friday. 
  During his weeklong visit in Taiwan, Joke met with Vice 
Premier Hsu Li-teh, presidents of the Control and Legislative 
Yuans, and other officials. He also visited the National Palace 
Museum.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Planners of China's 
reform programs said today that the government plans to limit 
this year's inflation to 10 percent in striving to ensure 
success of the economic restructuring. 
  Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of the State Commission for 
Economic Systems Restructuring, told a press conference that to 
achieve the purpose, the government will work hard to maintain a 
balance between China's total supply and demand and bring the 
money supply under control. 
  New price reform measures, commensurate to the financial 
capabilities of both the state and the people, will be published 
at an "opportune date," said Wang, who was attending the press 
conference with fellow Vice-Ministers Liu Zhifeng and Hong Hu. 
  The three officials insisted that on no account will this 
year's reforms in banking and taxation affect actual prices as 
they are only meant to rationalize the banking and taxation 
systems. 
  XINHUA has learned that the principle for the reforms, as 
described by the three vice-ministers, is one of "seizing the 
current opportunity to advance the reforms and accelerating 
development while ensuring stability." 
  They said that reform measures for 1994 are greater in 
number 
and more extensive than for any previous year. "The deeper and 
more extensively the reforms develop, the greater will be their 
repercussions and the difficulty in executing them," they told 
Chinese and foreign reporters at the press conference. 
  This calls for correctly handling the relations of reforms, 
development and stability and summing up experiences in good 
time, so that reform plans can be improved in times of 
necessity, they said. 
  Meanwhile, they said, what is also needed is boldness in 
exploring ways for pushing the reforms forward to ensure each 
one's success. 
  The officials spoke specifically on the urban housing reform 
in the wake of a State Council order to prohibit selling of 
publicly- owned housing at excessively low prices. 
  Recently, state-owned enterprises and institutions in some 
places rushed to sell their own housing as a fringe benefit for 
their staff. 
  "The State Council is finalizing the plan and will publish a 
decision on the housing reform for nationwide application," said 
Liu Zhifeng, a top official in charge of the housing reform. 
  "The State Council prohibition is meant to ensure success of 
the housing reform instead of halting it and help the government 
raise enough money for building new housing for the people," he 
added. 
  Work is under way to formulate reform-related laws and 
government decrees, according to these officials. 
  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is 
expected to publish a securities law in 1994. A draft of the 
law is being passed around among China's legislators, officials 
and experts for opinions and criticisms. 
  The State Council will soon publish a set of regulations on 
China's futures trading and is putting the final touches on a 
draft of the "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned 
Property and Assets." 
  Consultations are going on between the State Economic 
Systems 
Restructuring Commission and the State Economic and Trade 
Commission to choose 100 large-sized state-owned enterprises to 
experiment with modern enterprise management. 
  Meanwhile, 13 cities have been chosen to try out what is 
called "comprehensive reforms." These are Changzhou, Chongqing, 
Anshan, Yanji, Quanzhou, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Ningbo, 
Chengdu, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Harbin.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (CNS) -- China, being at a 
stage of rapid economic growth, is suffering from inflationary 
pressures now, the Vice Minister of the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, Mr. Wang Shiyuan, said in reply to a 
number of sensitive questions raised at a press conference held 
today. He noted, however, that the government had done much 
work on the prevention of inflation and many measures had been 
adopted to achieve this end. It is expected that the price rise 
for this year as a whole will be kept under 10 percent. 
  Mr. Wang said that the inflationary pressures at present 
mainly came from several fields. First, the adjustment of 
prices for production means in the past consecutive years and 
the continuous great scale of investment caused the rise in 
costs which in turn led to inflation. Second, a price rise of 
13 percent last year made a high start for the expected 
inflation during this year and adverse effects resulting from 
that inflation will appear this year. Third, a unified exchange 
rate for the renminbi and price reform to be carried out at a 
suitable time during the year will cause a price hike. Fourth, 
an excessive supply of money for maintain continuous economic 
growth last year will also lead to a price rise this year. 
  Mr. Wang said that the government was aware of the potential 
inflationary pressures and made the curbing of inflation and the 
maintenance of economic growth at a rapid, continuous and 
healthy pace for this year its priority. 
  The key to the controlling of inflation, according to Mr. 
Wang lay in the balance between general supply and demand, in 
the keeping control of economic growth to a suitable rate and 
control on the scale of investment.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and Chan Po-chung] </F>
  [Text] China's robust economy and sweeping reforms are set 
to suffer a setback after a decision to reimpose price limits 
and suspend some reform measures that could lead to price rises. 
The decision was made recently by the State Council, China's 
cabinet, in a bid to ensure a stable environment for the overall 
reforms this year. It also underlined the leadership's concern 
that mounting inflation that might lead to unrest. 
  An eight-point package demands that local authorities and 
regional price departments step up control and administration of 
prices while strictly implementing the central authorities' 
policy of setting price ceilings, Chinese sources told The 
Hongkong Standard yesterday. 
  The package, decided by a national emergency meeting on 
price 
controls following price rises for grain and staple foods late 
last month, stipulates that: 
  Price increases for railway transport and electricity by 
localities should not be higher than those previously set by the 
State Council. Scheduled reform measures that may send prices 
up should be suspended. Subsidies on certain products set by 
the central government should not be reduced. 
  A price limit should be reimposed by regional governments 
and 
local departments on some daily necessities, staple foods and 
major products if prices soar to levels that consumers cannot 
stand. 
  Protection prices for grain purchasing set by the local 
government should not be lower than those set by central 
government. 
  Administration of fees for education, medical services and 
other government services should be strengthened. 
  A price information network and a price recording system 
should be set up, and regular price reviews should be conducted 
by local price departments and results be reported to the State 
Council. 
  Efforts must be made by regional governments and relevant 
departments to ensure a stable market during the Lunar New Year 
and create a favourable environment for deepening reforms. 
  The moves appear to roll back many of the sweeping reforms 
worked out last year following the Communist Party's decision to 
embrace a capitalistic market economy. Local analysts expressed 
concern about Beijing's decision but said the impact on Hong 
Kong would be limited. 
  K.L. Wong, an economist at Sun Hung Kai Research, said the 
move would affect regions in different ways. "The decision is 
quite important to the people in northern China because they 
have suffered most from inflation." 
  Benjamin Chan, senior economist at the Bank of East China, 
did not think the moves were major setbacks, saying they were 
necessary to stabilise prices. The economists agreed that the 
impact of the move on Hong Kong business would be limited. 
  State-run media and senior Chinese officials have recently 
joined a growing chorus in expressing fears that the current 
economic reforms may lead to spiralling inflation and social 
unrest. Premier Li Peng warned that rapid strides in price 
reform would cause instability and the fast pace of freeing 
controls in 1994 would continue only as long as consumers could 
bear the inevitable inflation. The government reimposed 
controls on the price of grain and other staple foods in late 
December, after watching them soar 30 to 40 per cent in a month. 
  Top Chinese economic officials promised yesterday to push 
inflation below 10 per cent this year, despite mounting 
inflationary pressure. But they warned regional authorities of 
the possibility of social instability as a side-effect of 
China's economic reforms. 
  Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin has called for reasonable 
pricing in the consumer market because it affects people's 
living standards and social stability, the China Daily reports 
in today's issue.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- The beginning of the new 
year has turned a new leaf for China's economic development. 
This new year will be a year in which the nation's reform and 
opening up endeavors and economic construction will gather speed 
on the basis of the experiences and brilliant successes gained 
and achieved in the past 15 years. 
  Media at home and abroad commonly maintain that China's 
economic reform and development will both gather speed and will 
be successful, provided that the country proceeds carefully and 
practically, taking advantage of its economic and political 
stability. 
  How can China's economic reform and development proceed 
faster? The nation's economic development in 1993 shows a new 
economic system must be established through reform and a new 
course should be set for development, and that these are two 
mutually dependent requirements. This is due to the fact that 
only by building a new economic system through reform can 
productive forces be significantly liberated and a sustained, 
fast, and healthy national economic development be ensured. The 
entire macroeconomic development shows that, compared with 1992, 
the nation's economy in 1993 grew approximately 13 percent, 
industrial output grew 19.5 percent, and investment in fixed 
assets grew 47 percent. Such high rates of economic growth did 
not give rise to any major problems specifically because reform 
has enabled us to control the economic "express train" by means 
of macroeconomic regulation and control, and consequently our 
enterprises' production and operations have become more vital 
and our country's overall economic strength has grown. Last 
year's macroeconomic regulation and control replaced the 
previous practice of simply relying on administrative measures 
with a combination of economic, administrative, and legal 
measures, emphasizing economic measures. Moreover, as result of 
replacing direct regulation and control with indirect regulation 
and control, the nation has achieved results totally different 
from those of the past: The chaos in the monetary and 
distribution spheres were brought under control, fast economic 
growth was maintained, and dramatic economic ups and downs were 
avoided. 
  When viewed from another perspective, however, the major 
economic problems in 1993 are also problems that need to be 
resolved through reform. For example, 37.3 percent of state 
enterprises were operating in the red and their losses seriously 
restrained the growth in the returns of state businesses; and 
excessive investment in fixed assets and irrational investment 
seriously upset supply and demand. The solution to these 
problems lies in stronger reform measures, gradual establishment 
of a modern system for enterprise operations, pushing 
enterprises to take part in market competition, and fully 
restructuring the current investment pattern. Economic 
authority maintains: The current opportunity is one of 
development and reform, and if we disregard the opportunity of 
reform, we will lose the opportunity of development; there will 
hardly be development without carrying out reform; there will 
not be fast growth without accelerating reform; and reforms 
during the new period must target those deep-rooted problems 
obstructing fast and healthy economic development. 
  According to relevant state authorities, with an 
approximately nine percent economic growth this year, the nation 
will still have "sustained, fast, and healthy" economic growth. 
Although this figure is smaller than that of last year, it is 
still quite high when compared with the economic situations of 
most countries. Economic experts assert that the principle of 
maintaining "sustained, fast, and healthy" growth has the 
following profound meanings: The real nature of socialism is to 
liberate and develop productive forces, achieve common 
prosperity, and speed up the process of liberating productive 
forces, which are the core of socialist construction; China's 
fast growth should not be tentative or short- termed, but should 
be fast and sustained; and the development must be healthy, 
meaning that it is in line with law, it is subjected to 
macroscopic regulation and control, and it is supported by law. 
The reform over the past 15 years proves that whenever a place 
has been successful in reform, it also enjoys fast growth. 
China's fast economic growth over the past two years is the 
result the nation has achieved while speeding up reform and 
opening wider to the outside world after Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
gave his important speech in southern China and after the 
convocation of the 14th national party congress. 
  The current situation of reform is very good because the 
opportunity for reform is there and the goals have been clearly 
defined. However, the tasks of reform are also formidable. 
Under the situation where reform and development are both 
gathering speed, we should be aware that we cannot afford to 
carry out reform by suspending development. Fast growth is the 
result of reform, and only through reform can we master the 
"high tech" -- namely the new system -- for controlling the 
national economy during fast economic operations. We must learn 
the skills of speeding up reform under the circumstances when 
the economic development is fast and changes in the economic 
sector are fairly complex. The year 1994 is critical for 
China's reform and economic development and it should be a year 
in which China will be successful in these two areas.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch:" "Dual Speeding Up and Seeking </F>
Stability and Preventing Turmoil -- The Two Points of View in 
Response to Reform"] 
  [Text] Two different voices can be heard when China's 
economic reforms in 1994 are about to take a new step: One 
favors the "dual speeding up" of reform and development, while 
the other urges reform to pay equal attention to stability in 
order to prevent social turmoil. 
  A commentator's article released yesterday by the official 
XINHUA News Agency entitled "Parallel Progress in Reform and 
Development" stressed that the current reform situation is good, 
the objectives are clear and the opportunity is rare, while 
admitting that reform is facing a very difficult job. Faced 
with the new situation of "dual speeding up" in reform and 
development, we should have the following understanding: Learn 
how to speed up reforms under a more rapid pace of economic 
development and more complicated economic relations. The year 
1994 will be the most important for China's reform and economic 
development and should be a year of "double harvests" 
  The article says that the general view inside and outside 
China is that China's economy is facing a "dual speeding up" 
situation in which China must speed up both reform and 
development. If the opportunity offered by the current 
stability in the political and economic arenas is well 
exploited, then, with painstaking and practical work, China's 
economy shall reap a "double harvest" in which both reform and 
development will have made great strides. 
  The article pointed out: To achieve the "double harvest" 
objective, we must -- as we surely will if we take a look at 
national economic development in 1993 -- understand this: 
Reform must create new structures, and development must take a 
new path; the two are symbiotic. Only through reform and 
creating a new economic structure can the productive forces be 
released to any significant extent and can we ensure the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy [as published] development of the 
national economy. In terms of the economy at the macro level, 
GDP grew approximately 13 percent last year, industrial 
production grew 19.5 percent, and fixed-asset investment was up 
47 percent from the previous year. Even though it was operating 
at such a high speed, the economy was not disrupted by any major 
problems precisely because reform had been deepened. As a 
result, enterprises' production and operating power increased 
and combined national power entered a new dimension. 
  On the other hand, the official JINGJI XINXI BAO [Economic 
Information] pointed out in a front-page commentator's article 
that the current audacious reforms might result in social 
turmoil and sternly warned that the authorities must strike a 
balance between reform and stability. 
  The article says: "Without stability, we have nothing, and 
without a stable social environment we can achieve nothing." 
  The article says: The current reform effort signals that 
Beijing is abandoning the socialist planned economy that it has 
practised for the last 40 years and represents the deepest probe 
yet into the market economy, bringing with it "a redistribution 
of power and interests." 
  The article stressed: "If enterprises pay wages or can only 
pay them by raising loans, then there is a problem in the 
distribution of interests, which, if handled improperly, may 
cause trouble." 
  The article daringly touched on the "taboo" subject of the 
end of the "Deng Xiaoping Era." 
  The article said that any problems in the process of 
transferring power from 89-year old Deng Xiaoping to leaders of 
a younger generation will plunge the world's most populous 
country into disaster.

  [Text] A national conference on financial work was held 
here 12-15 January. Zhu Rongji, vice premier and governor of 
the People's Bank of China, gave an important speech at the 
closing session. He fully affirmed the achievements in 
financial work last year. Setting forth this year's guidelines 
for financial work, he forwarded a three-point demand on the 
vast number of cadres and workers in the financial system. 
  Zhu Rongji said: The CPC Central Committee and State Council 
decided last June to strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control of the national economy through 
rectification of financial order. Acting in accordance with the 
CPC Central Committee and State Council plan, the vast numbers 
of cadres and workers in the financial system firmly observed 
the "three agreed rules" in rectifying financial order, strictly 
enforcing financial discipline, pushing forward financial 
reform, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, 
thereby swiftly reversing the chaotic financial situation. 
Afterward, they promptly studied and analyzed the new 
development and problems in the national economy. In line with 
the demand to "stop dishonest practices and promote healthy 
trends," they exercised the right amount of macroeconomic 
regulation and control and firmly and decisively adjusted the 
direction in the use of funds. As a result, over 99 percent of 
the state's key projects have obtained the necessary funds; 
there have been no IOU's in purchasing agricultural produce; the 
strained situation in the working capital of major production 
enterprises and foreign trade firms has been essentially eased; 
and the excessive fluctuation in the development of the national 
economy has been avoided effectively avoided. At the same time, 
the over-issue of money has been curtailed; the total volume of 
money supply for the year has been controlled within the 
predetermined target; the market exchange rate has been 
consistently stable; and the state foreign exchange reserves 
have increased. Facts have demonstrated that the vast numbers 
of cadres and workers in the financial system are a contingent 
capable of standing the test, and they are trustworthy and able 
to fight. Zhu Rongji expressed appreciation and extended 
regards to them on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: Some problems popped up in our 
economic work during the first half of 1993. Through the 
strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, we have 
ameliorated these problems to some extent; however, we have not 
fundamentally addressed the profound problems. We have not set 
up a risk mechanism to restrain investment in fixed assets, and 
the inflationary pressure could build up at any time. The State 
Council has established guidelines for this year's financial 
work as follows: continuing the rectification of financial 
order, steadily promoting financial reform, strictly controlling 
total credit supply, and earnestly strengthening financial 
supervision and management. 
  He said: We made great achievements in rectifying financial 
order last year. However, this does not mean the task of 
rectifying financial order has been accomplished. Rectifying 
financial order will be an arduous long-term task for the 
financial system and it must be persistently carried out without 
relaxing our efforts. 
  Zhu Rongji called for continuous implementation of the 
"three 
agreed rules" set forth at the national conference on financial 
work last July. At the same time, he forwarded three additional 
demands on the vast numbers of financial cadres and workers: 
  1. Strictly control the total credit supply. The key to 
controlling the total credit supply is in limiting loans 
extended by banks at all levels to finance investment in fixed 
assets. Beginning this year, loans for key projects in 
infrastructure and basic industries will be arranged in a 
unified manner by the newly established state development bank; 
all other banks shall not use funds earmarked for non-fixed 
assets projects, particularly funds to be used as working 
capital, to finance investment in fixed assets. Banks at all 
levels shall not provide any loans to any unauthorized projects, 
projects beyond the total credit line, or components of an 
unauthorized project; the planned total credit line must not be 
exceeded even by one yuan. Investigation will be conducted to 
trace the responsibility of those who resort to illegitimate 
means to break the total credit line. 
  2. Once their policy-oriented businesses are divested, 
specialized banks shall begin their transition toward commercial 
banks. They shall make bold moves this year to explore and 
pioneer. In consideration of the fact that state-owned 
enterprises are currently in the process of changing their 
operating mechanism, specialized banks shall first implement a 
funding system based on the ratio of the enterprises' assets and 
liability within the limit of their credit line and then 
gradually establish a mechanism for self-restraint and 
risk-taking to assume responsibility for their own management 
decisions and profits and losses. In coordination with the 
enforcement of the "Bankruptcy Law," they shall make good use of 
the reserves for doubtful and bad loans, which have been 
increased this year. 
  3. Branches of the People's Bank of China at all levels 
shall earnestly change their functions and play a leading role 
in supervising and managing regional financial activities. 
Branches and sub-branches shall truly concentrate their 
energies on stabilizing currency and supervising and managing 
financial activities. At present, they shall make particular 
efforts to prevent the resurge of unauthorized fund raising 
activities by stopping every unauthorized one. Only by 
controlling unauthorized loans and fund-raising activities can 
we limit investment in fixed assets and reduce the inflationary 
pressure. 
  Zhu Rongji urged the vast numbers of financial cadres and 
workers to strengthen the building of their ranks by earnestly 
studying the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and actively, correctly, and comprehensively grasp and 
implement Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. He urged them to earnestly implement 
Comrade Xiaoping's instruction, "operate the bank the way a bank 
should be operated" and refrain from operating the bank like a 
"currency issuance company" or a "safe," still less making the 
bank a locked "safe." 
  Zhu Rongji concluded by urging all financial workers to 
unite, pluck up their spirits, and in accordance with the 
demands of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, accomplish in an all-around way every financial task. 
He urged them to make persistent efforts to carry out the 
struggle against corruption and, under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, 
successfully handle the relationship between development and 
stability to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
of the national economy. 
  Zhou Zhengqing, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, 
delivered a work report at the beginning of the conference.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China will continue 
to keep a firm grip on the total credit supply this year to ease 
the inflationary pressure that has been building up over the 
past few months. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also the central bank 
governor, told a national financial work conference which closed 
Saturday [15 January] in Beijing that all the banks must observe 
the "rules and discipline" enforced since July 1993 and control 
the credit line as planned. 
  He said that every bank must limit its lending to fixed 
assets investment projects and loans for major projects in 
infrastructure and basic industries will be arranged in a 
unified manner by the new state development bank. 
  Zhu said that banks will not provide loans to unauthorized 
projects or projects beyond the credit line. 
  "The planned total credit line must not be exceeded even by 
one yuan," the vice-premier stressed. 
  Zhu said that the macroeconomic control measures adopted by 
the central government are "appropriate", helping avert an 
excessive fluctuation of the national economy. 
  He said the over 99 percent of the key national projects 
have 
got the necessary funds; there have been no IOU's in purchasing 
agricultural produce; and the strained situation in the working 
capital of major production enterprises and foreign-funded firms 
has been eased. 
  At the same time, Zhu said, the over-issue of money has been 
curtailed; money supply has been controlled within bounds; the 
market exchange rate has been stable; and the state foreign 
exchange reserves have increased. 
  However, Zhu said that the macroeconomic control measures 
have eased some of the problems only to some extent and problems 
in the deeper part of the economy remain unsolved. 
  "We are still far from setting up a risk mechanism to 
effectively restrain investment in fixed assets and the 
inflationary pressure is likely to build up at any time." Zhu 
said. 
  He warned banks against inter-bank lending in violation of 
banking rules, raising interest rate without authorization or in 
disguise or running economic entities. 
  The central bank governor asked the specialized state banks 
to take a big pioneering step this year in their transition to 
commercial banks. 
  He said that the branches of the People's Bank of China 
should concentrate their efforts on stabilizing the currency and 
supervising operations of financial bodies. 
  The bank governor called for particular attention to the 
current task of preventing a resurgence of unauthorized lending 
and raising of funds, saying that only by so doing, is it 
possible to ease the inflationary pressure.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, Standing 
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC] 
Standing Committee, said recently: The establishment of a 
socialist economic structure is a great pioneering undertaking, 
and the establishment and development of a socialist market 
economic structure requires standardization and perfect legal 
guarantees. 
  In an interview with this year's No. 2 issue of the 
fortnightly magazine ZHONGHUA YINGCAI [CHINA'S TALENTS], Qiao 
Shi said: There is no precedent in the world for a smooth 
transition from a planned to a market economy, no ready formula 
for establishing the legal system of a socialist market economy. 
Therefore, China has to explore this on its own. Since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was 
convened, the NPC and its Standing Committee have adopted more 
than 200 sets of laws and decisions concerning the law. 
Following the First Session of the Eighth NPC, 13 sets of laws 
and 11 decisions concerning the law have been adopted. A number 
of important laws will be enacted this year. The enactment and 
enforcement of these laws have guided, standardized, guaranteed, 
and regulated the creation of a socialist market economic 
structure. However, because the legislation for the socialist 
market economy covers extensive areas, there are numerous laws 
that need to be enacted. We must pay close attention to 
planning in our legislation. Judging from the present 
situation, the NPC and its Standing Committee must act promptly 
to formulate laws designed to standardize norms for the market, 
keep the market orderly, perfect macroeconomic control and 
regulation, and improve social security. The enactment of laws 
in these areas is essential to the establishment and perfection 
of a socialist market economy, which requires standardization 
and perfect legal guarantees. We should accelerate the pace of 
economic legislation and update the backward legal system in the 
spirit of reform so that people can be aware of legal and 
illegal behavior under the conditions of a market economy, and 
can use laws to guide, promote, and guarantee the smooth 
progress of reform and to provide a legal basis for the growth 
of the market economy. Meanwhile, we should revise or abolish 
in time laws and regulations which are incompatible with the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure so as 
to ensure the consistency and coordination of the legal system 
of the market economy. 
  In discussing outstanding problems in the current 
legislative 
work, Qiao Shi said: In formulating laws concerning the 
socialist market economy, it is imperative to follow the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to act in 
the spirit of the party's 14th National Congress and in 
accordance with China's Constitution. We must be bold in 
exploration and practice, and we must imbue ourselves with the 
spirit of reform in handling and resolving problems and 
difficulties in the course of legislation. First of all, we must 
maintain legislation in pace with the progress of reform and 
opening up. In accelerating the pace of economic legislation, 
we must have a thorough grasp of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
guideline that it is better to have than not to have laws and to 
expedite than to proceed slowly with the enactment of laws. To 
avoid legislation lagging behind reform, it is necessary to 
promptly formulate laws concerning matters that should be 
promoted or abolished. Second, we must subordinate local 
interests to the overall interests of the state. The growth of 
a market economy will inevitably break the traditional pattern 
of separating administrative powers. Therefore, in drafting 
laws, it is necessary to bear in mind the overall situation of 
safeguarding the fundamental interests of the state and its 
people, and to avoid undue emphasis on local interests and 
powers. Third, we must proceed from the reality in China and 
boldly study and draw on the experience of other countries. 
Fourth, we must improve the legislation of local people's 
congresses and promptly formulate local laws and regulations 
concerning the market economy. Fifth, experts should play a 
more important role in lawmaking. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said 
long ago that we must have more experts specializing in various 
fields to take part in making laws. This idea is important. 
From now on, whenever any department wants to draft a law, it 
must seek the support of experts in related fields to do the 
job. When we do so, not only can we pool the views of all 
quarters, broaden our vision with collective wisdom, and 
accelerate the legislative process, but we can also speed up the 
process of training legislative, judicial, and law enforcement 
personnel. Sixth, while speeding up the legislative process, we 
must also pay attention to improving the quality of laws. When 
a law is being made, we must thoroughly study the legal 
principles and repeatedly assess the feasibility of their 
application. While the articles are being drafted, every effort 
must be made to make them clear, specific, and applicable. We 
must also pay attention to the compatibility between laws and 
draw up supporting regulations. After laws have been enacted, 
some laws need guidelines for implementation, and others must be 
interpreted. Meanwhile, the inspection and supervision over the 
implementation of those laws must be intensified so that they 
can effectively safeguard and promote the development of our 
socialist market economy. 
  Qiao Shi pointed out: Drawing up laws concerning the 
socialist market economy is something new for us. While we must 
consider China's actual situation when we draw up laws and 
regulations, we must also broadly study and borrow other 
countries' legislative experiences and learn about those that 
are useful to China. All the laws must be conducive to 
developing the economy and safeguarding China's stability and 
unity. While we must consider China's actual situation when we 
make a law, this does not mean that we can ignore foreign 
experiences. We must dare to assimilate that in foreign laws 
which is good and useful to us. We should also learn from their 
mistakes. We may directly transplant those articles that we can 
use, and then reinforce [chong shi 0339 1395] and improve them 
during their application. Because the market economy is an 
open, worldwide economy, our laws relevant to the market economy 
must be compatible with certain foreign laws. This 
compatibility not only can speed up our process of creating 
market economic laws but can also link our economy with the 
world economy and enable us to compete in the world. 
  Stressing that laws must be strictly enforced in order to 
fight corruption, Qiao Shi pointed out: The problem of fighting 
corruption must be solved comprehensively. The problem cannot 
be effectively solved unless it is tackled with educational, 
administrative, legal, and various other measures. Over the 
years, the NPC and its Standing Committee have drawn up many 
laws specifying how corruption, bribery, smuggling, 
prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, drug trafficking, and 
other types of lawless behavior should be censured, and these 
laws are the legal basis for cracking down on economic crimes 
and punishing the corrupt elements. The problem now is that 
these laws have not been effectively enforced. Because laws are 
not obeyed -- or not strictly obeyed -- lawless conduct is not 
punished, and in certain places laws are replaced by verbal 
rulings or are repressed by wielders of power and crimes are 
even committed by law enforcement elements, certain lawless 
elements are not censured and acts of corruption have not been 
curbed effectively. Such phenomena must be corrected. To 
intensify legislation, law enforcement, and to censure 
corruption according to the law, the laws and regulations that 
have been drawn up must be firmly followed, everybody must be 
treated equally before the law, and no organizations or 
individuals may have the special privilege of placing themselves 
above the law. The NPC and its Standing Committee must intensify 
their inspection and supervision of the implementation of laws 
and must make every effort to correct the situation in which 
laws are not effectively enforced. Meanwhile, we must also 
seriously study the characteristics and the ways of fighting 
corruption when the country is adopting a socialist market 
economy, and we must continue to formulate or improve our laws 
and regulations relevant to administrative ethics so that there 
will be legal basis for censuring corruption more effectively. 
  Qiao Shi stressed: To intensify the anticorrutpion struggle, 
the party and the state must also improve their supervisory 
functions. Socialist market economic operations certainly will 
give rise to readjustments of administrative authority over the 
economy between central and local authorities and among various 
departments, and we must devise effective mechanisms for 
controlling and supervising this authority. While establishing 
our socialist market economic system, we must have effective 
control and supervision over authority. Uncontrolled power is 
apt to generate corruption. During the course of the building of 
our socialist market economic system, we must also intensify our 
control and supervision over authority. We must set up a 
powerful supervisory system by organically combining the 
supervision by the party, state organs, organs of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, and the masses as 
well as by the media. The establishment and the perfection of 
the legal system governing our socialist market economy 
certainly will be fundamental measures helpful for guarding 
against the generation of corrupt phenomena.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch:" "The Central Authorities Urge Opening </F>
Up New Markets; The State Council Decides To Establish an Import 
and Export Credit Bank"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (TA KUNG PAO) -- A central leader 
recently pointed out that China will continue to implement the 
strategy of market diversification and emphasis on quality in a 
bid to open up new markets. 
  This leader said: Over the past two years, China has made 
certain achievements in implementing the strategy of market 
diversification in the field of international economic relations 
and trade. On the whole, however, our trade is still confined 
to a small number of developed countries and regions. While 
preserving and developing existing markets, we must strive to 
open up new markets to ensure a bigger market area and leeway 
while spreading out risk for China's opening up and the 
development of its international economic relations and trade. 
  It is necessary to continue the effort to improve the 
product 
mix. Eight years ago, we proposed accomplishing two changes in 
the product mix, specifically, the move from the dominance of 
primary products to that of manufactured products and the change 
from primary processing of manufactured products to deep 
processing of manufactured products. The first change has been 
realized, but there is still a long way to go to reach the 
second. We must make energetic efforts to develop 
export-oriented machinery, electrical products, and packaging 
plants that are highly competitive on the international market, 
are processed on a deep level, have high added value, and 
demonstrate good export potential. The State Council has 
decided to establish an import and export credit bank, through 
which the state will give special support to the export of those 
items in terms of credit funds. It is also possible to consider 
using methods such as offshore financing to support the export 
of capital goods. 
  It is necessary to carry forward the principle of 
emphasizing 
quality. This year, efforts shall continue to be concentrated 
on punishing the manufacturers and sellers of sham and shoddy 
commodities. The quality factor should be viewed as reflecting 
our national reputation and the quality of the people and as 
connected to the image of our socialist system and reform and 
opening up. All departments related to scientific research and 
development, production, foreign trade, customs, and commodity 
inspection shall cooperate fully with each other, shall make 
substantial efforts to strengthen quality control and 
supervision, and shall strive to make marked improvements in the 
quality of export commodities this year.

<F P=106> [Article by special commentator Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 </F>
5478), chief economist of State Statistics Bureau: "Let 
Enterprise Bankruptcy Become a Mechanism"] 
  [Text] Since last year, aiming at the acute contradictions 
and problems arising from rapid economic development, the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council have taken timely 
measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control; so far, positive results have been scored, and the 
overall situation is changing in a good direction. But at the 
same time, some problems and contradictions in economic life 
have emerged in another area, which is mainly manifested in the 
rising contradiction caused by market restraints. Problems such 
as operating under capacity, sluggish sales, increasing stocks 
and debts, and decreasing returns have once again plagued 
enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, while the 
number of enterprises where production has stopped or who are 
operating at half capacity has markedly increased. 
  Judged superficially, these new problems, which have emerged 
during economic operations, are mainly attributable to the 
marked shrinkage of the supply of capital in society, and to the 
fact that enterprises are far from being able to fund 
themselves; on the other hand, the "two-way squeeze" resulting 
in a rapid increase in imports and the contraction of 
medium-term demand has intensified the difficult situation in 
which enterprises produce and operate. However, judged from a 
deeper angle, at a time when the macro environment is becoming 
easier, the repeated occurrence of big increases in losses 
incurred by enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, is 
attributable to the fact that enterprises have not yet formed a 
bankruptcy mechanism which gets rid of poor performers and 
allows only the fittest to survive, and this is the crux. 
Because the process of structural adjustment of assets in stock 
is rather slow, resource allocation cannot be promptly 
optimized, and the result is that the state has to support both 
loss-making and profitable enterprises, leading to the 
irrational situation in which bad enterprises tie down good 
enterprises and both good and bad enterprises compete for 
limited resources. This kind of mechanism, which allows both 
bad and good enterprises to survive, will inevitably cause a 
conflict in which resources in society are always in short 
supply and problems in the market are always acute. So long as 
this kind of mechanism exists, it is difficult to cast off the 
currently existing condition in which state-owned enterprises 
lack adequate vitality and a large number of them are making 
losses. If we merely increase the money supply in order to solve 
the conflicts, what follows will be price increase, and 
eventually we will have to strictly control the total quantity 
in order to eliminate the problem of inflation. Therefore, 
forming a mechanism as soon as possible which allows enterprises 
to go bankrupt is an indispensable link in reducing restraints 
on the market and resources. Otherwise, if the cause of the 
illness is not removed, inflation and debt chains will take 
their turn to enter and leave the stage, and this will 
inevitably affect the stable development of the economy and 
could even cause us lose the opportunity for development. 
  Judging from the current situation, although the Enterprise 
Bankruptcy Law has been implemented for five years, it has often 
been difficult to shut down enterprises. There are many reasons 
for the failure to form a mechanism allowing enterprises to go 
bankrupt. Among the main obstacles, one is restraints due to 
traditional concepts. Due to a lack of proper understanding of 
the need to allow good state-owned enterprises to survive and 
bad ones to disappear, as well as the need to form a bankruptcy 
mechanism, in practice, a whole set of policies and measures 
protecting backwardness and allowing both good and bad 
enterprises to exist has been implemented, and this has 
insulated state-owned enterprises from the bankruptcy mechanism. 
  Second, restraints from the old system. On the one hand, the 
ownership of enterprises is ambiguous; superficially they are 
owned by the whole people, but actually no one is responsible 
for them, and the operators of enterprises can hardly promptly 
handle the assets of enterprises according to objective needs, 
bad enterprises cannot be sold, and good enterprises cannot be 
purchased, and this inevitably affects enterprise bankruptcy. 
On the other hand, there are barriers between higher and lower 
levels, between regions, and between ownership systems, everyone 
has a say in deciding whether a state-owned enterprise should 
live or die, and they refuse to allow it to change its ancillary 
relations easily. In addition, inequalities in taxation and 
pricing policies often lead to a situation where state-owned 
enterprises shoulder many burdens of a state policy nature, and 
there are no common bench marks for enterprises which are not 
subject to the restraints of the state's mandatory policies, and 
this has made it impossible for enterprises' returns to really 
reflect good or bad operational conditions in enterprises. 
  Third, restraints from social security. For a long time, we 
have not admitted the existence of an unemployment problem under 
socialist conditions, therefore, we have not established a 
series of social security systems, such as unemployment 
insurance, old age insurance, and medical insurance. As a 
result, burdens in these areas have to be shouldered mainly by 
enterprises themselves. It is often very difficult to solve 
this kind of problem, which is caused by history. At present, 
the country is still not in a comfortable financial condition, 
and, for a short period to come, cannot completely shoulder the 
social security obligations if enterprises go bankrupt. 
  Fourth, restraints from the production structure. At 
present, among enterprises which really have to go bankrupt 
according to the law of our country, many are producing excess 
products, and their ability to change production capacity is 
low. For example, although many military enterprises need 
readjustment, their production capacity cannot be easily 
transformed into a capacity which is badly needed in society, 
therefore, there is no way they can go bankrupt. In addition, 
the overdevelopment of the processing industry is another 
problem, because many enterprises are duplicating low-standard 
construction; in fact, their assets have lost value in society, 
and, after going bankrupt, they cannot spare effective 
resources. On the contrary, society has to spend a portion of 
new resources to protect them. Since the input-output process 
has low returns, it is better to keep them rather than to close 
them. 
  Fifth, restraints from the legal system. Enterprise 
bankruptcy involves transferring assets and debts, but, at 
present, the asset assessment and transaction order and the debt 
settlement order are not standardized, and sound protection by 
the legal system is not in place. Therefore, it is still 
difficult to perform various tasks relating to enterprise 
bankruptcy in a prompt and orderly fashion. 
  To conclude, at present, there are many factors restraining 
the bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises, but the most 
important ones are obstacles in terms of concepts and systems. 
Therefore, to form a mechanism as soon as possible which allows 
enterprises to go bankrupt, we must proceed from reform and 
realize and perfect it during reform. 
  First, we must change the functions of government as soon as 
possible and realize the running of society by the government. 
Only when we can grasp the building of a social security system 
and a reemployment mechanism, remove various unequal policies 
and conditions as soon as possible, and return the duties and 
functions of running society from enterprises to the government 
so as to allow state-owned enterprises to unload their burdens, 
can we then make it possible for enterprise to go bankrupt. 
  Second, we must firmly grasp innovation in the enterprise 
system to make it suit the needs of the market economy. To 
establish a modern enterprise system and practice 
corporatization, the crux is to straighten out property rights 
relations and cast off a situation where the government is not 
separated from enterprises, and only by doing so can we really 
form a mechanism allowing enterprises to go bankrupt. 
  Third, we must build an assets transaction market as soon as 
possible and create conditions for the flow of enterprise assets 
after they go bankrupt. When enterprises go bankrupt, there has 
to be an assets transaction market as protection, for it would 
be difficult to effectively promote enterprise bankruptcy if 
only the government's actions are relied on; we must also use 
the strength of market and rely on market rules to carry out 
fair competition and transactions to enable bankruptcy to become 
a natural phenomenon. For this reason, we must step up work in 
formulating standardized market transaction regulations to 
safeguard orderly transaction behavior, protect legal interests, 
and crack down on illegal phenomena. 
  Fourth, we must properly direct public opinion, publicize 
the 
objective necessity of enterprise bankruptcy through the mass 
media, and change the influence of traditional concepts. A 
correct direction for public opinion is the "catalyst" for 
correct psychological expectations and behavioral norms, and 
doing this job well is helpful to the smooth promulgation of 
various reform measures. 
  Fifth, we must adhere to the principle of active and steady 
work and solidly promote an enterprise bankruptcy system. 
Because the direct reason for enterprise bankruptcy in our 
country at this time when the system is changing track is very 
different from the reasons for enterprise bankruptcy under the 
conditions of a typical market economy, therefore, bankruptcy 
has to embody the principle of the market economy on one hand, 
and suit China's conditions on the other hand, and we must 
operate prudently when handling bankruptcy, design 
scientifically, and reduce various negative effects to the 
minimum. We can study whether we can build an early warning 
system for bankruptcy, and by so doing we may, on the one hand, 
cause bankruptcy pressures on enterprises so they will build 
self- restraining mechanisms and quicken their pace toward the 
market, and, on the other hand, enable the state to have a 
general idea of the quantity of losses which have been incurred 
by enterprises over the years and which have to be handled by 
way of bankruptcy to provide scientific data for macroregulation 
and control on the restrained release of the negative effects to 
society of enterprise bankruptcy.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (CNS)--China is to change its 
state-owned enterprises into state-operated solely-funded 
limited companies in a bid to establish a new state-owned 
enterprise system. 
  The state-owned solely-funded limited company pattern will 
be 
a new organizational pattern in China's company system. As 
enterprises of public ownership are now being involved in the 
trial practice of the shareholding system, the restructuring of 
state- operated enterprises into state-owned solely-funded 
companies will change state-owned enterprises into legal persons 
observing the basic principle and the management system employed 
by companies. 
  Following restructuring, the solely-funded limited companies 
will have certain fundamental characteristics including first, 
the independence of such enterprises of the sources of their 
capital and their being a legal person with their registered 
capital enabling them to enjoy their civil rights and 
shouldering their civil responsibilities. Second, the state is 
the only source of capital for a particular enterprise and it 
holds limited liability for the company to the extent defined by 
the amount of capital it offers. Third, management bodies 
involving state-owned assets have to base their trust on the 
board of directors which should be authorized to manage the 
company's assets and act in the interests of the company.

<F P=106> [By ZHONGGUO SHUIWU BAO [CHINA TAXATION JOURNAL] reporter </F>
Wang Yongli (3769 3057 7787): "The First Week After the New 
Taxation System Was Put Into Effect"] 
  [Text] The new taxation system has been implemented for a 
week. Has the work of levying tax on enterprises and tax 
payment returned to normal? Are commodity price fluctuations 
caused by the taxation reform? Bearing these questions in mind, 
this reporter visited Beijing Municipal Administration of 
Taxation in the tax- levying period. 
<H5>  Speaking a Few Words on Consumption Tax Again </H5>
  In the current taxation reform, we adopt the turnover 
taxation system with value-added tax at its core, which is a 
relatively standard one in the international community. 
Value-added tax reduces the occurrence of repetitive levies and 
embodies the general international principles of being 
impartial, neutral, universal, and simplified. Since a basic 
tax rate of 17 percent and a low tax rate of 13 percent are set 
in the value-added tax, all kinds of enterprises are subject to 
this levy and have to pay 17 (or 13) percent in accordance with 
the regulations. The value-added tax covers the whole process 
of commodity production and circulation, simplifies the taxation 
system, brings about a fair share of tax burdens, and is 
conducive to converging with the international market. However, 
in the process of implementing a value-added tax, the tax burden 
on commodities, which is also heavily taxed in the international 
community, markedly drops. In the current taxation reform, we 
apply the method of implementing a consumption tax to carry out 
special readjustment. Some people think that the "Provisional 
Regulations on PRC Consumption Tax" are precisely equivalent to 
the special consumption tax of the past. Hence, small 
fluctuations were stirred up several days ago. 
  On 5 January, invited by this reporter, Sun Zhiqiang, 
director of Beijing Municipal Administration of Taxation, spoke 
a few words on consumption tax again. Director Sun said that 
consumption tax should be grasped from four aspects: 1. A 
consumption tax, which derives from product tax and value-added 
tax in the former taxation system, is the conversion of the old 
taxation system into the new taxation system. In the past, 
prices with a consumption tax levied contained product or 
value-added taxes, and the proportion was high. As far as the 
new value-added tax implemented at this time is concerned, taxes 
levied on these commodities drop and will be collected by the 
State through levy of a consumption tax; this is a change in the 
internal structure of our taxation system. The levy of 
consumption tax does not increase the overall tax burden of 
these commodities, therefore, the consumption tax does not 
directly affect commodity prices. 2. As far as the scope of 
levying and collecting a consumption tax is concerned, it 
embodies the principle of "imposing a ban on something through 
levying taxes." For example, this principle applies to 
commodities other than daily necessities, such as valuable 
jewelry and cars; some commodities which are not suitable for 
over-consumption, such as cigarettes, liquor, and firecrackers; 
and some commodities which are resources in nature and which 
cannot be regenerated, such as gasoline and diesel fuel. 3. 
There are 11 categories of items on which the consumption tax is 
levied, which will not affect daily lives of the masses. 4. 
Carrying out special readjustment through levying a consumption 
tax on certain commodities is the usual practice of most of the 
countries in the world. 
<H3>  Value-Added Tax Is An Important Link in the Chain of 
Economic Life </H3>
  As far as large-scale and open specialized trades in society 
are concerned, production, circulation, and consumption form an 
interlinked chain. The new value-added tax reforms ends, once 
and for all, the old taxation system, and it is also an 
interlink which strengthens the chain of economic life. What 
counts is to help all taxpayers understand and master the 
system. Following the promulgation of the "Provisional 
Regulations on PRC Value-Added Tax" on 13 December, all cadres 
of the taxation sector were urgently mobilized to use the 
fastest way in the shortest period of time to convey this 
"Regulation" to tens of millions of taxpayers, and to explain 
and sell value-added tax special vouchers to be used by 
enterprises from 1 January. In the following 10 days or so, 
taxation cadres tried very hard to explain the new measures to 
the people. 
  On 5 and 6 January, which was in the tax-levying period, 
this 
reporter visited the Cuiwei Road Taxation Office under Haiding 
District Taxation Sub-Bureau, the No.1 and No. 3 Taxation 
Offices under the Chaoyang District Taxation Sub-Bureau, and 
taxation sub- offices dealing with cases involving foreign 
investors. In the Cuiwei Road Taxation Office, a comrade from 
the Rongjie Technological Development Company of the Haiding 
District Maintenance Station of Metal Structures asked, "Our 
unit in-charge pays sales tax, what tax should we pay?" Liu 
Jianxin, an official especially dealing with the case, asked in 
reply, "Is your enterprise's accounting work done 
independently?" The comrade replied, "Yes." Liu Jianxin said, 
"Then, you should pay the value- added tax." The taxpayer said, 
"What we produce is non-standard pressure containers, and 
processed materials must be supplied by senior units, but there 
is no special voucher and we are not able to cast accounts." 
Liu Jianxin said, "Your internal operating mechanism should be 
readjusted." The taxpayer said, "Our earnings also come from 
running training classes and doing maintenance work." Liu 
Jianxin said, "A sales tax is levied on income earned from 
training classes whereas a value-added tax is levied on income 
earned from maintenance work, they are accounted and taxed 
separately..." According to this reporter's calculation, more 
than half an hour was spent on this case. 
  At the No.3 Taxation Office under Chaoyang District Taxation 
Sub-Bureau, a comrade of Zhongxin Motor Company asked, "We have 
kept over 100 cars in stock, now customers want to buy them, 
what kind of vouchers should we issue?" Jia Yongxuan, head of 
the administrative group, replied, "You should issue special 
value-added tax vouchers." The taxpayer asked, "How are they 
issued?" Jia Yongxuan answered, "You should first calculate the 
cars' import prices, profits, and taxes, then divide them into 
different categories and calculate the prices with taxes 
deducted and the amount of the new value-added tax, and fill in 
special vouchers separately." Since the taxpayer still did not 
understand, Jia Yongxuan unfolded two sheets of paper, wrote 
down the calculations and explained in detail to the taxpayer at 
the same time. It was only when the two sheets of blank paper 
were fully filled with calculations that the taxpayer said, "I 
get it." For a long time in the past, taxes were included in 
calculated prices, but now taxes are not included in the 
calculated prices. This sudden conversion, together with the 
task of breaking down enterprise stocks into prices and taxes 
and enabling taxpayers to properly use value-added tax vouchers, 
is the very beginning of the normal operation of the new 
taxation system as well as the point of convergence between the 
new taxation system and economic life. This is complicated and 
delicate work, and only when taxpayers study it for a certain 
period of them can they grasp it. 
<H3>  Problems of Understanding and Operation Must Be Solved As 
Soon As Possible </H3>
  Since the new taxation system has been introduced for only a 
short time, some enterprises do not have a clear understanding 
of the concept of deducting the new value-added tax from prices. 
For example, the enterprise in the first link of production 
issues a correct special voucher, but the enterprise in the 
second link of trade makes a mistake when calculating the retail 
price, that is, it adds the purchase price to the tax amount 
levied in the previous link and multiplies it by the difference 
between the two prices, thus increasing the commodity's retail 
price. Moreover, some enterprises simply add a proportion of 
the amount of sales tax to the original prices which have 
already included taxes, thus leading to an extremely large rate 
of price rise. These are problems of understanding and 
operation, which can be solved through constant training and 
propaganda.

<F P=106> ["Special topic": "Economic Forecasts for China 1994"; </F>
first paragraph is TANGTAI editor's note] 
  [Text] In December, the CPC convened a national economic 
work conference at which some forecasts and arrangements for 
next year were made. The formal annual economic plan will only 
be made public after it has been passed by the NPC in March of 
next year. However, from the research of CPC think-tanks, we 
can gain an understanding of some of the ideas of the 
authorities in respect to the economy next year. 
<H3>  "An Analysis of 1994 Macroeconomic Trends" by Liang Yan 
[4731 6056] </H3>
  The direction of the economy in 1994 will be determined by 
the orientation of the regulatory and control policies adopted 
by the central government. In the first half of 1993, the speed 
of growth in national GNP (gross national product) reached 13.9 
percent. Seen from the current economic operational situation, 
it will be very unlikely that it will be possible to bring 
annual growth in GNP back down to below 10 percent by relying 
solely on the existing regulatory and control strengths. Thus, 
the annual growth in GNP for 1993 will very likely be between 9 
and 12 percent. 
  1. The expectations and actions of the central 
government. 
  The various central research institutions have put forward 
four possibilities for GNP growth next year. 
  1. First possibility: GNP growth will be less than 9 
percent. 
  When the central government is deciding the orientation of 
its 1994 macroeconomic policies, it will be mainly considering 
the two following factors: 1) The level of economic growth in 
the second half of 1993; 2) The growth in the level of prices. 
  If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 falls back to 
below 7 percent (the possibility of this is very small), the 
central government will place price levels in a secondary 
position, and will implement a relaxed monetary policy, so that 
the GNP growth in 1994 will recover to 9 percent. This is 
because the fall in GNP growth to 7 percent will mean a higher 
price has to be paid for the retrenchment policies, and nobody 
wants to see that. If price level increases follow GNP growth 
back below 10 percent it is certain that we will see a relaxed 
monetary policy in 1994. 
  Second possibility: GNP growth will be 9 percent. 
  If the GNP growth in the last half of 1993 falls back to 
between 7 and 10 percent, and if growth in price levels 
continues to hover around 15 percent, it is possible that the 
central government will take as its major concern clamping down 
on inflation, and will continue to implement a tight monetary 
policy for a time, at least until price level growth returns to 
below 10 percent. In this way, the GNP growth in 1994 will 
hover around 9 percent. Of course, the central government would 
not be happy with this situation. 
  Third possibility: GNP growth will be 10-12 
percent. 
  If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 is between 10 
and 12 percent, and price increases fall back to below 10 
percent, this will be an economic operational situation which 
will be quite pleasing to the central government. This is 
because, in such a situation, there will be little difficulty 
for the central government to make policy choices. This will 
result in the central government maintaining a tight monetary 
policy in 1994. The degree of tightness will be reduced but it 
will not be completely given up. As long as the GNP growth rate 
is lower than 12 percent, but higher than 10 percent, the tight 
money policy will assist in restraining the sprouts of economic 
overheating as necessary, and can also guard against an economic 
landslide. 
  Fourth possibility: GNP growth will be above 12 
percent. 
  If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 is maintained 
at 
or above 12 percent, and the level of price increases is higher 
than 10 percent, then in 1994 the tight monetary policy of the 
last half of 1993 will be maintained and the degree of tightness 
may even be increased. 
  Looking comprehensively at the various factors, the economic 
regulatory and control policies adopted by the central 
government in 1994 will depend of the operational results of the 
economy in the last half of 1993. However, the aim of 
maintaining GNP growth at 10 percent in 1994 will not be 
difficult. The key question is what measures need to be adopted 
to curb inflation, so that it can be controlled at below 10 
percent. 
  2. The expectations and actions of local 
governments. 
  The local governments represent the interests of the 
regional 
economic entities. Thus, there are often clashes with the 
overall interests represented by the central authorities. 
However, the local governments are also very important 
intermediate links in the implementation of the central 
government's targets, and the effectiveness of the central 
government's policies is to a large degree determined by the 
matching policies of the local authorities. Seen from the 
current situation, it is impossible for local policies to fully 
implement central macroeconomic regulation and control policies. 
It may well occur that they, to a greater or lesser extent, 
water down the central policies when implementing them in the 
localities. This is because there is mutual vying between 
provinces and regions in terms of economic growth, and this has 
become a major factor in promoting economic overheating. 
  In addition, because of the imbalance between the economic 
development of various regions, they all have full reason to try 
to accelerate the economic development of their own regions. The 
local governments in various regions are worried that if they 
completely implement the central retrenchment policies, it will 
result in their locality suffering harm. In the first half of 
1993, while the speed of GNP growth in some coastal provinces 
exceeded 20 percent, in some other provinces, GNP growth was 
only about 3 percent. The situation across the country was that 
the growth in coastal areas was higher than that in the central 
areas, and in turn that in the central areas was higher than 
that in the western areas. This disparity basically reflected 
the levels of economic development in the respective areas. 
  The high speed of economic growth in the last two years 
involved the role played by a certain amount of mutual vying 
between provinces. This was particularly so in respect of the 
leading provinces, whose speed of economic growth exerted a very 
great psychological pressure on other provinces. 
  Economic operations in 1994 will still be carried out under 
the impetus of the mutual vying between various levels of local 
government. The central government's tight monetary policies 
have already realized certain results. However, the policies 
and activity modes of local governments cannot be changed and it 
is very likely that those who have been affected most by the 
tight monetary policies are the hinterland provinces. First, 
the funds of coastal provinces do not have the feedback problem, 
and it is possible that for there to be continuous development 
in those areas. The process by which a small amount of the 
funds of hinterland provinces are fed back from coastal 
provinces also means that the costs of the original engineering 
projects will increase. Under the current tight monetary 
policies, feed-back funds will for a time experience difficulty 
in finding a profitable project. This will result in the 
use-efficiency of the funds of the hinterland provinces being 
greatly affected. Second, the funds which have been fed back 
from the coastal areas and invested in projects may, in a 
situation where there are no guarantees of continuing funds, 
turn into dead funds. For these two reasons achieving the 
feed-back of funds is extremely difficult. 
  The goals and activity modes of local governments means that 
economic operation will maintain a growth of about 10 percent. 
This is because the tight monetary policies of the central 
government have not yet been implemented to the degree where 
they completely bring under control the activities of mutual 
vying between local governments. At the same time, the 
differences in the economic development levels of various 
regions are becoming increasingly great and in the process of 
microeconomic regulation under the tight monetary policies, the 
mutual vying among local governments will push the Chinese 
economy to a fairly high level of growth. 
  3. The expectations and actions of enterprises. 
  The tightening up policies which were initiated in the last 
half of 1993 resulted in newly commenced projects being 
partially controlled, and the prices of building materials 
falling back to lower levels. These tightening up measures 
checked the scale of production of enterprises, and the market 
saw a contraction. However, the capacity of enterprises to 
absorb the costs of raw and semifinished materials was improved. 
In looking at whether or not the economic results of 
enterprises can be improved, we have to look at which of these 
influences is the strongest. If the former is stronger than the 
latter, the enterprise results will see a decline. In the 
opposite case, the results will see an improvement. 
  Actually, the current microeconomic regulatory policies 
deliver a message to enterprises, and that is that in 1994 the 
economy will still grow at quite a high speed. However, in a 
situation where financial order sees an improvement, it may well 
be of greater benefit to the development of production by 
industrial enterprises, as funds will flow toward industrial 
production. However, in a situation where the pressure on the 
scale of investment is not great, enterprises have an optimistic 
attitude towards economic growth in 1994. In addition, over the 
last year, consumption by social groups has seen a trend of 
strong growth, and consumption by the people has seen a steady 
rise. Thus, economic development in 1994 may well see stable 
high-speed growth prompted by the optimistic activities of 
enterprises. 
<H3>  "Analysis and Forecasting of Grain Supply and Demand" by 
Cheng Cheng [4453 0701] </H3>
  1. Forecast of grain supply in 1994. 
  1. Forecast of the country's output. 
  According to forecasts by the Ministry of Agriculture this 
year (1993), there will be increased agricultural production in 
most areas of the country. Total grain production is likely to 
reach 438.86 million tonnes. In 1994, output may reach 451.79 
million tonnes, which will be a record figure. 
  The increased grain production in 1993 has been realized in 
a 
situation where area planted has seen a continual reduction. 
(Following reductions in the previous 2 years, there has been a 
further reduction of 11 million mu this year) It is estimated 
that 1994 will see a slight increase in the area planted, and 
the total may reach 1.66-1.68 billion mu. 
  2. Forecast of imports next year. 
  In the past, it was generally the case that over 10 million 
tonnes of grain was imported annually. Now that prices have 
been freed and each region can operate as it wishes, it is 
estimated that 1994 imports will be 13 million tonnes. 
Converted to unprocessed grain, this will be equivalent to 
about 15.03 million tonnes. 
  2. Forecast of grain demand in 1994. 
  1. Forecast of food grain demand. 
  In 1992, per-capita grain consumption in China was 235 
kilograms. It is estimated that in 1994, this figure will fall 
to 233 kilograms. If, in 1994, the national population reaches 
1.20 billion, the total volume of food grain consumed throughout 
the country will be 15.93 million tonnes. 
  2. Forecast of fodder grain demand. 
  In 1992 the per-capita consumption volume of fodder grain 
was 
about 63 kilograms. It is estimated that in 1994, the 
per-capita fodder grain demand might reach 67 kilograms. The 
national demand for fodder, converted to unprocessed grain, will 
total about 93.22 million tonnes. 
  3. Forecast of demand for industrial-use grain. 
  It is predicted that in 1994, demand for industrial-use 
grain 
(including industrial-use grain utilized in foodstuffs, 
non-staple foodstuffs and non-food products), converted into 
unprocessed grain, will total about 14.15 million tonnes. 
  4. Forecast of demand for seed grain. 
  It is predicted that the demand for seed grain throughout 
the 
country in 1994 will be 19.15 billion tonnes. 
  5. Forecast of export volume. 
  From January to August, China exported 7.79 million tonnes 
of 
grain, an increase of 560,000 tonnes on the same period last 
year. The volume of grain imports was 4.51 million tonnes, a 
reduction of 4.59 million tonnes as compared with the same 
period last year. With this one increase and one decrease, over 
the period January to August, the net exports increased by 5.15 
million tonnes. It is estimated that the net import of food 
grain in 1994 could reach 7 million tonnes, while 1994 exports 
could reach 12 million tonnes. 
  Totaling the above-noted items and adding the 3 million 
tonnes of grain wasted or spoiled annually, the total demand for 
grain will be 462.92 million tonnes, of which domestic demand 
will total 452.92 tonnes. 
  3. Analysis of China's grain supply and demand in 
1994. 
  On the basis of the calculations above, 1994 should see 
demand exceeding production, and we will have to make use of 
stores and imported grain to fill the shortfall. Thus, the 
general trend of the market price of grain next year will be 
upwards. In particular, because the market looks good for 
paddy, corn and wheat, their prices will rise to varying degrees. 
<H3>  "Inflation Rate in 1994 Will be Between 7 and 10 Percent" by 
Jiang Zhuowen [3068 0340 2429] </H3>
  There are many factors which will affect the trend of prices 
in 1994. Of these many factors, a number of factors such as the 
scale of investment, macroeconomic policies, interest rates for 
deposits and the price reforms will have a major influence on 
prices in 1994. 
  Investment. The value of actual investment 
completed in 1992 was 758.9 billion yuan, an increase of 37.6 
percent. This year, the plans kept the figure to 800 billion 
yuan, an increase of 5.5 percent. However, excluding price rise 
factors, there will be an increase of between 34 and 40 percent. 
By July, as the strengthened effects of macroeconomic 
regulation and control had begun to see results, the cut back of 
fixed assets saw a reduction in newly commenced projects, a 
decline in commodity housing investment and a reduction in the 
growth of investment in local projects. However, the various 
key state construction projects, especially those which 
increased supply and alleviated bottlenecks, were not affected. 
  From this we can see that while the increase in fixed assets 
investment this year may be lower than the growth in 1992, it 
will not be much lower, and it is likely that a growth rate of 
about 30 percent will be maintained. That is, investment will 
be 940 to 980 billion yuan. It may also occur that the 
investment will break the 1 trillion yuan mark. If this year's 
growth rate is maintained next year, it will have a definite 
effect on the overall annual price trend. 
  The regulatory and control power of the macroeconomic 
policies. Because of the deepening of reform and opening 
up, the establishment of a market economy structure and 
particularly because of the initial establishment of China's 
commodity market and the initial establishment of an economic 
operational mechanism, macroeconomic regulation and control has 
already seen initial results. 
  As to how to carry out regulation and control during the 
next 
step, the central authorities have decided to carefully handle 
the regulatory and control power, so as to avoid great economic 
fluctuations. The characteristic of the operation of these 
macroeconomic regulatory and control measures is "restricted 
braking, so as to achieve a soft landing." Thus, it is 
predicted that in spring next year, the regulatory and control 
powers may be gradually relaxed. 
  Interest rates. The raising of savings deposit 
interest rates by the People's Bank of China on two occasions, 
15 May and 11 July, had the dual effects of increasing deposits 
and controlling people's inflationary expectations. However, 
the sizes of the increases and the rapid pace of their concrete 
implementation are worthy of study. The great increase of 2.18 
percent in the interest rate on 15 May saw a lively response by 
urban and rural residents, and in May and June the people 
increased their deposits by 54 billion yuan. This was 18.2 
billion yuan more than the increase during the same period of 
the previous year. It should be possible to complete the issue 
of state bonds in coordination with administrative measures. 
Seen from the situation at present, if the current interest 
rate level is maintained until the first half of next year, it 
will be beneficial to the reduction of the money supply, and it 
will ensure that prices see a quite low growth rate. 
  Price reform. Considering things from the current 
controlling of inflation and the controlling of inflationary 
expectations, the State Council has decided to implement no 
further price reform measures in the second half of this year, 
and related plans have been postponed till an appropriate time 
in future. The choice of an appropriate time to implement price 
reforms is a very important issue. The reason price reforms saw 
results during the period of economic improvement and 
rectification was because at that time the overall level of 
prices was quite low. Thus, even if the price reforms took big 
steps, it did not induce inflationary expectations among the 
people. The current postponement of the implementation of price 
reform measures is intended to restrain inflation. 
  Although the investment, interest rate and macroeconomic 
policies and the price reforms will play basic roles in respect 
of the price situation next year, we also need to pay attention 
to exports, imports, exchange rates and the economic situation 
around the world. 
  Exchange rates. Generally, it can be said that 
the price of renminbi on the foreign exchange market will 
continue to be stable. This is because on the one hand, 
international pressure is great. Various Western countries 
widely believe that China promotes imports by keeping the value 
of its currency low, so as to offset the disadvantageous effects 
of the large increase in imports following its readmission to 
GATT. If the renminbi is devalued by a great amount however, it 
will have a negative effect on the efforts to be readmitted to 
GATT. On the other hand, the policy-making level in China has 
already recognized that relying purely on a low exchange value 
of renminbi to promote exports is not only of limited 
effectiveness in promoting exports, but can also increase the 
prices of domestic imported products, and give rise to domestic 
inflation. This will have a negative effect on China's efforts 
to control inflation. Thus, a stable exchange rate is the basic 
trend. 
  Next year, there will be a decline in the growth of the 
scale 
of investment, interest rates will be maintained at current 
levels, macroeconomic policies will continue to increase the 
degree of macroeconomic regulatory and control, price reforms 
will continue to be deferred, there will continue to be a 
favorable balance of trade and the exchange rate will be stable 
or will see a slight decline. In addition, there will be the 
effects of "cockiness factors" [qiao wei yin su 5062 1442 0936 
4790]. Thus, next year, the level of prices will see an overall 
fallback. Over the year, there will be a low rate of economic 
growth of between 2 and 5 percent. 
  Next year, the scale of investment will maintain a growth 
rate of 30 percent, while at an appropriate time in the first 
half of 1994, interest rates and macroeconomic policies will be 
gradually readjusted. Price reforms will also be revived and 
they will be tightly grasped and completed. In terms of foreign 
trade, there will be a small favorable balance or an overall 
balance. The exchange rate will be basically stable or will see 
a slight decline. This will be beneficial to macroeconomic 
readjustment and the maintenance of an appropriate speed of 
growth. It will also be beneficial to absorbing the effects of 
cockiness factors. Next year, the basic trend of prices will be 
a stable increase of between 7 and 10 percent. 
<H3>  "Steel Output in 1994 to Top 90 Million Tonnes" by Wang Li 
[3769 0500] </H3>
  In the first half of 1993, China's steel output reached 
43.43 
million tonnes, in which the output of steel products reached 
38.5 million tonnes. These figures were respectively 12.5 
percent and 21.23 percent up on the same period in the previous 
year. Calculating on this basis, the total annual production for 
1993 will reach 87.5 million tonnes. This shows that China's 
iron and steel industry has great prospects. 
  In 1994, if the national economy continues to grow at a 
speed 
of 9 percent, there will be a corresponding increase in the 
consumption of steel products, and the output of steel products 
will continue to grow on the basis of this year's production. 
There appears no doubt that steel output will top 90 million 
tonnes next year. Following the disintegration of the former 
Soviet Union, China's steel output may leap to the number two 
position in the world next year. Although next year the steel 
products market will continue to see a situation where supply 
cannot meet demand, it is predicted that the supply-demand 
contradiction will be less intense than that this year. 
  The reason the steel enterprises will see such growth is 
that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan and during the first 2 
years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, a great volume of technical 
transformation funds have been invested, and production capacity 
has been raised. Thus, next year steel output will continue to 
see sustained growth. What will constrain it will be raw 
materials such as iron ore and scrap steel and the transport 
facilities. Apart from having to adopt necessary policies and 
encourage increased production of iron ore domestically, there 
is also a need to appropriately increase the imports of iron 
ore, scrap steel, and steel blanks. 
  To sum up, as there will still be a supply-demand gap, we 
can 
look forward to another upward movement in the market. In 1994, 
the demand for steel products will grow by 10-13 percent. As to 
resources, domestic production may increase by 12 to 15 percent 
and to some degree it will be necessary to rely on imports. 
  In terms of trading in iron and steel, there will be a 
decline in the import of steel products. This will show itself 
in the second half of this year. According to relevant 
statistics, in the first half of this year, 11.16 million tonnes 
of steel products were imported, a growth of 3.6 times as 
compared with the same period in the previous year. However, in 
the second half of the year, the volume of steel products 
imported has seen a decline. It is estimated that over the full 
year, about 15 million tonnes will have been imported. In 1994, 
even if China joins GATT, the volume of imported steel products 
certainly will not be higher than this year, and will very 
likely be about 10 million tonnes. 
<H3>  "Renminbi To Devalue by 15 Percent in 1994" by Jia Changlu 
[6328 7022 6424] </H3>
  During the period while the renminbi is making the 
transition to free convertibility, there exists the risk that 
inflation will be induced. The exchange rate lever will become 
an important means by which to regulate domestic and external 
economic relationships. 
  In 1993, because of the strengthening of psychological 
expectations and speculation in foreign exchange, strong market- 
driven fluctuations occurred in the swap exchange rates. Over 7 
months, the swap exchange rates for the renminbi saw three major 
fluctuations, on each occasion exceeding 20 percent. This means 
that the renminbi has already been successively devalued from 
the posted exchange rates, to where even the swap exchange rate 
is, through these fluctuations, moving downward. 
  China's economic relations with the outside world have 
already greatly expanded and fluctuations in international 
prices directly affect the domestic economy. If the renminbi is 
not freely convertible, a great amount of international 
inflation will flow into the country, but it will not be 
possible for domestic inflation to be transferred out into the 
international sphere. If there is no futures market for 
renminbi, the major risks and damage resultant from exchange 
rate fluctuations will have to be borne entirely by enterprises. 
During the period while the renminbi is making the transition 
to free convertibility, there exists the risk that inflation 
will be induced. There will be an increasingly close 
relationship between Chinese residents and foreign exchange, and 
the exchange rate lever will become an important means by which 
to regulate domestic and external economic relationships. On 
the basis of this situation, in 1994 the renminbi will 
experience the following trends: 
  To what degree will the renminbi devalue in 1994? The posted 
exchange rates are determined on the basis of export foreign 
exchange costs, while the swap exchange rates are decided by the 
import situation and the foreign exchange management system. In 
1994 and for several years hence, renminbi exchange rates will 
see a trend of devaluation. The reasons for this are: 
  -- The domestic economy will see sustained high-speed growth 
and GNP will grow at over 10 percent annually. 
  --Inflation will be sustained at quite a high level, with 
the 
retail price index seeing an annual growth of 10-15 percent. 
  --Exports will grow annually at over 20 percent, while 
imports will grow even more swiftly. Thus, a trade deficit will 
appear. 
  --Foreign exchange management will be gradually relaxed and 
even if it is not relaxed, actual loss of control will become 
increasingly serious. 
  At the same time, the fluctuations in the swap exchange 
rates 
will be frequent and these will mainly arise through speculation 
in foreign exchange. If the state engages in effective 
intervention through foreign exchange purchases and sales, these 
fluctuations may be reduced. If the state uses the highest 
price limit to carry out control, it will result in the 
expansion of the foreign exchange black market. 
  Initial estimates indicate that in 1994, swap exchange rates 
will see a drop of about 15 percent. This will exceed the 
domestic price rises and economic growth. In subsequent years 
we will see a devaluing of between 10 and 15 percent annually. 
This is deduced on the basis of historical experiences. Over 
the last 15 years, the renminbi exchange rate as calculated on 
the basis of the posted price has fallen from $1 being 
equivalent to 1.7 yuan to where it is valued at 5.8 yuan, a fall 
in value of 240 percent, or an average annual fall of 10 
percent. According to the swap exchange rates, it has fallen in 
value to 10.8 yuan, a drop of 535 percent, or an average annual 
devaluation of 15 percent. Also, the overall level of domestic 
prices has risen 150 percent. That is to say, the value of the 
renminbi externally has fallen at a rate which is twice as great 
as the decline in the domestic value, and in future this trend 
will continue. 
  Is the swap exchange rate stable? 
  The exchange rate falling back in July 1993 was mainly the 
product of the implementation of state economic regulatory and 
control measures, which changed psychological expectations and 
resulted in companies selling off large quantities of foreign 
exchange. The reason it did not break through the 8.5 yuan base 
line was the limitations imposed by the foreign exchange costs 
of exports. If the value of the renminbi climbed further, it 
would affect exports and promote imports. At present, the rate 
is stable at about 9 yuan. This is the result of a balance 
between the two forces. In the first half of the year, the 
trade deficit reached $3.5 billion, while foreign exchange 
reserves fell to $6 billion. Proceeding from the requirement to 
achieve a balance of international payments, the renminbi should 
not be allowed to devalue excessively. 
  However, as the domestic economic retrenchment whereby banks 
only accept funds and do not provide credit has been in place 
for over four months, the renminbi is extremely tight, and it 
will naturally not lose much value. The current stability is 
only temporary. The domestic tight monetary policies cannot be 
sustained for too long a time, and they will probably begin to 
see gradual relaxation by the end of the year. Also the demand 
for foreign exchange to fund imports has not been reduced. 
Thus, it is predicted that by the beginning of 1994, there will 
be a further fall in the renminbi swap foreign exchange rate. 
<H3>  "The Risks of Merging Exchange Prices Next Year" by Jia 
Changlu [6328 7022 6424] </H3>
  The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
decided that beginning next year, the exchange prices of the 
renminbi would be gradually unified. At present, for renminbi 
there are "three prices for the one currency." There is the 
"official price" (where $1 converts to 5.68 yuan). There is 
also the "swap price" (where $1 converts to 8.7 yuan) and 
further the "black market price" (where $1 converts to 9 yuan). 
The situation is extremely chaotic and this has obstructed the 
normal development of international trade and investment. 
  Can the dual-track exchange rate be unified? 
  Another significance of the devaluing of the posted exchange 
rate is that under conditions where the swap exchange rate is 
stable and the differential between the two exchange rates is 
quite small, achieving the unification of the dual exchange 
rates, scrapping foreign exchange quotas and changing quota 
management into spot exchange management so as to realize a 
unified exchange rate, is one of the things which China has 
promised to GATT as a condition for its readmission. This must 
be achieved in the next few years. The end of 1993 is the best 
opportunity for the merger of the dual exchange rates. The 
price differential of the two tracks will be small, the 
scrapping of quota prices will cause little disturbance and if 
there is a desire to purchase quotas, the amount the state 
financial administration will have to pay out will be small. 
However, it should be noted that there exists quotas for 10 
billion in foreign exchange, and that to purchase these will 
still require a large volume of renminbi. At the end of 1992, 
the posted exchange rate was 5.8 yuan, while the swap rate was 7 
yuan. The quota price however was only 1.2 yuan. If they first 
devalued the posted exchange rate to 6.8 yuan and then purchased 
all of the outstanding quota on the basis of $1 of foreign 
exchange quota converting to 0.2 yuan, the cost would have been 
the lowest. Unfortunately, the reforms were too slow and the 
opportunity was missed. The end of 1993 also provides an 
opportunity. If the posted exchange rate is devalued to 8 yuan, 
and quota are purchased at a quota price where $1 converts to 
0.5 yuan, then it will be possible to achieve the unifying of 
the two tracks at the 8 yuan level. This could still be 
regarded as a good move. If, for fear of being unable to 
guarantee foreign exchange income or in order to pander to the 
interests of particular departments, this merger is again 
deferred, a greater price will have to be paid in future. 
  The risk of implementing free convertibility of 
renminbi. 
  Implementing a unified floating exchange rate does not mean 
that the renminbi will be freely convertible. It will only be 
basically freely convertible in the trade sphere. There will 
still be strict restrictions on individuals and foreign 
investors. The next step however will be to completely abolish 
foreign exchange controls and allow free convertibility in 
respect of foreign exchange. It is estimated that this will be 
achieved in 3 to 5 years. However, the risks are very great. 
If just 20 percent of the people's savings deposits of 1.2 
trillion yuan were converted into foreign exchange, then 240 
billion yuan would be converted into $20 billion. If we work on 
the basis of a ratio of one to twelve, this conversion would 
consume all of China's foreign exchange reserves. An even 
greater problem is that the banks just do not have so much 
renminbi to expend. If people become nervous, at any time a 
bank run might occur. Then, if consumer goods are in 
insufficient supply, foreign exchange will become the target of 
panic purchasing. Thus, as renminbi heads toward free 
convertibility, there is a need to be extremely careful. 
<H3>  "Investment To Exceed 140 Billion [figure as published] Yuan 
in 1994" by Lu Dacheng [7120 6671 2052] </H3>
  Next year, the total value of fixed investment throughout 
the 
country will exceed 1.4 trillion yuan, a 24 percent growth on 
1993. This high speed of growth will be achieved on the basis of 
the 45 percent growth seen in 1993 as compared with 1992. 
  The statistics of the State Planning Commission show that in 
1993 the total fixed asset investment in society will be over 
1.14 trillion yuan, a 45.1 percent increase over the previous 
year. In this, whole-people investment will grow 50 percent, 
collective investment will increase 59 percent and individual 
investment will grow by 8 percent. This trend of investment 
inflation led to the implementation of macroeconomic regulatory 
and control policies in the middle of this year. 
  The characteristics of fixed asset investment in 1993 can be 
summed up in the following points: 
  1. There has been high-speed growth in investment in 
state-owned enterprises and, in the first half of the year, this 
reached 70 percent. Collective enterprises saw even greater 
growth, with investment in the first half of the year growing 
105 percent. 
  2. Local project investment has been higher than central 
investment, with the proportion of local investment seeing 
straight- line growth. 
  3. Investment clearly moved towards the southeast coastal 
areas. The growth there was over 30 percent higher than growth 
in the central and western regions. 
  4. The investment structure has not been rational. Apart 
from transport and communications, the proportions of investment 
in bottleneck sectors declined. Also, the proportion of 
productive, constructive investment declined, but commodity 
housing saw a very high rate of growth. 
  5. Investment performance has been poor and there has been a 
decline in the fixed asset creation rate. 
  6. The rate of funds provision has not been ideal. The 
annual investment plan arranged by the state only provided 44.79 
billion yuan. However, the actual needs of construction on the 
basis of rational engineering were 49.8 billion, meaning a 
shortfall of 5 billion yuan, a figure representing 11.2 percent 
of the estimate. Although retrenchment policies have been 
implemented, due to the inertia of growth and other promotional 
factors, China's investment demand is still growing and 
expanding at a quite high rate. According to forecasts, total 
social fixed assets investment in 1994 will exceed 1.4 trillion 
yuan, and actually reach 1.417 trillion yuan, a growth of 24.3 
percent. Of this, whole-people investment will see a growth of 
25.5 percent, collective investment will see a growth of 27.3 
percent and individual investment will see a growth of 12.2 
percent. 
  The reasons for the growth of investment in 1994 can be 
summed up as follows: 
  Policy-nature reasons include: 
  1. In order to reduce the economic development disparities 
between the eastern, central and western regions, next year the 
state will support the development of the central and western 
regions and, to a certain degree, will increase the support it 
provides for the development of these regions. 
  2. In order to increase the vigor of old medium-size and 
large state-owned enterprises, the state will continue to 
increase investment in them. 
  Economic-nature reasons include: 
  1. The macroeconomic regulation and control measures 
implemented this year have brought about a soft landing for the 
economy in the second half of the year. This has laid a 
foundation for quite swift economic development next year. 
  2. This year, many investment projects have already been 
commenced and a large amount of funds have already been put into 
them. They cannot really be abandoned half way. 
  3. Prospects look good for the drawing in of foreign funds 
in 1994 and there will need to be corresponding renminbi 
investment. 
<H3>  "State-Run Enterprises to Undergo Major Reorganization in 
1994" by Jia Changlu [6378 7022 6424] </H3>
  The third plenary session decided to increase the pace of 
reform of state-run enterprises. China's state-run enterprises 
face a major challenge and 1994 will be a crucial year for them. 
  An intense clash. 
  The stage of changeover from the old track to the new will 
see some overlapping and a series of clashes. Next year, in 
their production operations, state-run enterprises will keep one 
eye on the market and will be guided by market signals and will 
organize production on the basis of marginal patterns. They 
will keep the other eye fixed on the government. They will put 
efforts into completing the government targets and in this 
respect will have to diverge from the laws of margins. In 
resource deployment, they will have to consider economic 
rationality, but will not be able to violate their loyalty to 
the upper levels. Economic operations will have to be in accord 
with lateral market relations, but will also have to be 
coordinated with vertical administrative relations. The 
enterprises will have to face the market and take responsibility 
for operations and their own profits and losses, and will also 
have to bear all kinds of social, administrative and policy 
tasks. In this way, they will lose most of their autonomy in 
operations and their right to assume responsibility for profits 
and losses. The limits of enterprise property rights are hazy. 
Sometimes, ownership rights are expanded and this eats into the 
rights and interests of the operators. At other times, 
ownership rights are reduced, and this produces an outflow of 
state-owned assets and a flood of short-term activities by 
enterprises. The operational rules for property rights are not 
unified and administrative rights and economic rights are 
overlapping and entangled. In the market, bureaucratic 
practices prevail while in the bureaucracy, market practices 
prevail. The two systems are locked together in confrontation 
and it is thus difficult for state-owned enterprises to achieve 
efficiency. 
  Thus, the reform of state-owned enterprises next year must 
follow two principles. First, the noneconomic factors of 
state-owned property rights must be given up. This principle 
can be realized through the reform of government organs and 
functional transformation. This will allow the separation of 
economic rights and administrative rights and the separation of 
economic functions and administrative functions. The second is 
to promote the structuralization of property rights. If there 
is a desire to form an economic environment in which there is 
exchange at equal value and effective competition, then it is 
necessary for there to exist many competitive property rights 
entities, not ownership entities. 
  The three major trends in 1994. 
  On the basis of the above analysis, next year the 
development 
of state-owned enterprises will see three major trends: First, 
the trend of separate streams. The majority of small and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and some of the large 
enterprises which are not suited to the implementation of a 
state ownership system will be "transferred down" to collectives 
or individuals through leasing or contracting, and they will 
gradually be transformed into shareholding operations. Various 
enterprises, which because of their serious losses and the fact 
that they have long been unable to make enough money to cover 
liabilities, will have difficulty avoiding the fate of 
bankruptcy and elimination. Second, the trend of hybridization. 
Not only will there be crossholdings among state- owned 
property rights entities, but there will also be mutual 
shareholdings among different types of property rights entities. 
Jointly, they will establish enterprise groups and, through 
pooling funds and technology with foreign businesses, they will 
bring into play the superiorities of "hybridization." Third, a 
competitive orientation. The state will control the property 
rights of large enterprises which affect the national economy 
and the people's livelihood, but the enterprises will have full 
operational autonomy. The enterprises of different natures will 
compete equally and state- owned enterprises will bring their 
own superiorities into play through competition, and will guide 
the healthy development of the market economy. 
  Thus, next year there will be a high tide of internal 
autonomy in China's state-owned enterprises.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Fang Yuan (2455 0337): "Zhu Rongji Has </F>
Decided To Lay Down His Heavy Burden in March, and There Will Be 
Keen Competition for the Post of Central Bank President"] 
  [Excerpt] As disclosed by a source in Beijing, China's 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has decided to resign the post he took 
up concurrently as president of the People's Bank of China at 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, 
which will be held in March this year. His successor will 
probably be Yin Jieyan, who currently holds the position of 
director of the State Administration of Exchange Control. In 
view of the ghastly signs of price rises and an overheated 
economy which have emerged in the mainland's economic situation 
recently, the national monetary conference, which ended a short 
time ago, decided to slow down the pace of monetary reform and 
to continue to practice macroeconomic regulation and control 
policies. 
  It has been disclosed that the news about Zhu Rongji's 
intended resignation as president of the central bank came from 
Zhu himself when he attended a national monetary work meeting 
last month. It was reported that, in his speech, Zhu Rongji 
indicated that the responsibility that he shouldered in 
macroeconomic management work was so heavy that he was unable to 
simultaneously attend to the work of the central bank. Given 
the intense rivalry between the two most promising vice 
presidents -- Zhou Zhengqing and Dai Xianglong -- the post of 
central bank president may finally fall on the "dark horse" -- 
Yin Jieyan, the current director of the State Administration of 
Exchange Control. As disclosed, Yin has worked in the central 
bank for a long time and, as early as 1985 when Chen Muhua was 
president of the bank, he was secretary general of the bank's 
board of directors. Since last year, particularly since the 
unification of exchange rates this year, Yin has performed 
outstanding work in stabilizing the renminbi's exchange rate. 
He is worthy of being called an experienced banking official 
with expertise in modern banking. Hence, he is most probably 
the candidate who will be selected by the central authorities 
for this post. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Zhao Jiangping (6392 3068 1627) of the Policy </F>
and Regulation Department of the State Administration of 
Exchange Control: "Foreign Exchange Control System and Foreign 
Exchange Market"; from "XINHUA Mail Box"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec (XINHUA) -- "We should reform the 
foreign exchange control system, set up a market-based 
manageable floating exchange rate system, and an integrated and 
standardized foreign exchange market. The Renmini should 
gradually become a convertible currency." This idea was put 
forward in the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some 
Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure." It represents an important decision by the 
CPC Central Committee to resolve key issues in our reform of the 
foreign exchange control system, after comprehensively and 
systematically analyzing and summing up the history and present 
conditions of China's foreign exchange control. It will play an 
active role in pushing forward the drive to improve and develop 
foreign exchange control. 
  China has achieved fairly rapid economic growth since the 
reform and opening up; but the overall economic level is low. 
To fully utilize limited foreign exchange resources, it is 
still necessary for the state to exert various degrees of 
control. The main purpose is to ensure an increase in foreign 
exchange and its reasonable usage, and to facilitate a basic 
balance in China's foreign exchange income and expenses as well 
as international account income and expenses so as to ensure the 
opening up policy; economic ties and trade with foreign 
countries; and to create conditions for the final goal of making 
the Reminbi a convertible currency. 
  China's current foreign exchange control system was 
established and developed during the course of deepening reform 
of the economic structure. It has played a fairly active role 
in promoting China's economic ties and trade with foreign 
countries. But during the course of building a socialist 
economic structure, problems existing in the current foreign 
exchange system began to crop up. Such problems need to be 
gradually improved through various concrete measures. 
  1. To change the coexistence of the official rate and market 
rate of the Renminbi. The official rate is adjusted and 
announced by the State Administration of Exchange Control in 
accordance with China's economic development and the condition 
of its foreign trade in particular, in overall consideration of 
commodity price levels at home, international income and 
expenses, and the fluctuation of major foreign currencies on the 
international financial market. The official rate is mainly 
applied to part of the foreign exchange income and expenses of 
the central authorities, part of non-trade foreign exchange 
income and expenses, as well as the settlement of some 
international accounts. The market rate is regulated and 
decided by the demand-and-supply rule of the market. Under 
normal conditions, the government will not interfere in the 
fluctuation of the exchange rate. The market rate has played an 
important role in regulating China's foreign exchange funds. 
  The system affording the coexistence of the renminbi's 
official and market exchange rates took shape under special 
historical circumstances, it is an expression of China's price 
system and distribution system in the distribution of foreign 
exchange at the present stage, and it is a transient phenomenon 
appearing during the course of economic reform. As a system 
governing exchange rates during a special period, this system 
has played its part in promoting the development of China's 
economic relations and trade with foreign countries, but it has 
also some harmful effects. The renminbi's two different 
exchange rates and the two different ways of settling accounts 
that this phenomenon has created are neither favorable for the 
efficient use of the nation's foreign exchange resources nor for 
reestablishing China's lawful status in GATT. Thus, the 
mechanisms causing the coexistence of two different exchange 
rates must be replaced by a well-managed and market-based 
floating exchange rate system. 
  2. The current market which regulates foreign exchange must 
be restructured and a foreign exchange market with uniform 
standards to follow should be established. 
  China started to regulate foreign exchange in October 1980, 
and the scope of regulation has been expanding over the past 
decade or so. From regulating foreign exchange held by Chinese 
and foreign enterprises, the scope of business has now expanded 
to regulating foreign exchange held by individuals. The 
regulated prices are determined by supply and demand in the 
regulated foreign exchange markets. [sentence as received] 
There are now more than 100 foreign exchange regulatory centers 
and 18 foreign exchange open markets. These markets have been 
playing positive roles in adjusting a foreign exchange surplus 
or shortage, alleviating problems caused by a foreign exchange 
shortage, accelerating the circulation of foreign exchange, and 
making more efficient use of foreign exchange. 
  However, because the regulatory markets in various parts of 
the country are established according to administrative 
demarcation, their establishment has given rise to problems 
which hinder the development of China's foreign exchange markets 
and which restrict them from demonstrating their functions -- 
problems such as regional barriers, the inefficient lateral 
circulation of foreign exchange, unequal and unstable foreign 
exchange rates, and restricted market development. Thus, 
establishing a foreign exchange market with uniform standards to 
follow is an important aspect in restructuring the foreign 
exchange control system. 
  3. To attain the goal of having the renminbi be exchangeable 
for foreign currencies is a long-term development target that 
China has set for reforming its foreign exchange control system 
and banking systems, but this reform will take time. 
  The ultimate goal that China has set for reforming its 
foreign exchange control system and the scientifically conceived 
plan for the process is to make the renminbi a convertible 
currency step by step. Attaining this goal is an objective 
demand set for China to reform its foreign exchange control 
system so that the nation can open wider to the outside world 
and establish a socialist market economic system. But the level 
of China's development shows that we still cannot meet certain 
basic requirements needed for the renminbi's convertibility, and 
so we still need time to create the necessary conditions to 
attain this objective through real reforms. For example, we must 
reform the current foreign exchange system to improve the 
mechanisms governing the operation of the foreign exchange 
market; we must improve the mechanisms for setting the 
renminbi's exchange rates through establishing a market-based 
and well-managed system which governs floating exchange rates; 
and the state must increase its foreign exchange reserves 
through improving its ability to increase foreign exchange 
revenues and conserving foreign exchange spending. As China's 
overall national strength becomes greater, becomes more capable 
of establishing foreign contacts, and enjoys higher economic 
status in the world, the process which seeks the renminbi's 
convertibility also will accelerate.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China onshore oil 
production this year is projected to be 140 million tons and 
that of natural gas 16 billion cubic meters, China's top oil 
official said today. 
  These figures, released by Wang Tao, president of the China 
National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), at a national oil work 
conference here today, are both higher than the government-set 
output targets. 
  This is an effort to match the development of the oil 
industry to the demand of the country's rapid economic growth, 
Wang told the conference. 
  He described the situation of the oil industry as "good", 
although it falls short of demand and has become one of the 
bottlenecks of the national economy. 
  China produced 139 million tons of crude and 15.9 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas, thanks to strengthened exploration 
and development of oil fields. However, the ever-expanding 
demand has pushed China onto the verge of becoming a "net oil 
importer." 
  Wang called for intensive exploration for additional 
resources to prepare China for the next century. China expects 
to extract 200 million tons of oil and gas in oil equivalent by 
the year 2000, according to an ambitious plan. 
  To this end, China has embarked on a strategy of stabilizing 
the production in the eastern part of China and developing 
reserves in the western part. 
  The eastern part of China, which includes such important oil 
fields as Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, is China's main oil 
producer. 
  CNPC will invest billions of yuan in a bid to maintain the 
production level in the eastern part of the country. New 
technology and management will be adopted in the Daqing oilfield 
in order to keep its annual oil output well above 55 million 
tons up to the turn of the century. 
  The western part of China, especially the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region, is regarded as a key alternative. Its crude 
output for the first time topped 10 million tons for the first 
time [as received] in 1993. 
  This year the figure is expected to rise to 11.9 million 
tons, Wang said. Exploration will be carried out both 
intensively and extensively, he added. 
  CNPC is striving to strike a balance between oil output and 
new recoverable reserves and between capital input and output, 
according to Wang. As the government eases off restrictions on 
oil prices, the industry has wiped out red inks. However, Wang 
warned against high cost and low efficiency in oil production. 
  Wang welcomed the participation in oil exploration and 
development by other sectors, enterprises, localities, people 
from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, overseas Chinese and foreign 
investors. 
  CNPC has announced the second round of international bidding 
for risk exploration in 26 blocks and 11 projects to enhance oil 
recovery in the existing oilfields. 
  Preparatory work for the third round bidding is to start 
soon 
and more blocks in southwestern and western China are expected 
to open to foreign bidders. 
  Wang admitted that China's oil will not be able to meet the 
demand by the year 2000. He said crude import will depend on 
economic growth but China still needs to sell some oil abroad 
for foreign currency, technology and equipment.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China's machinery 
industry yielded 35.2 billion yuan in profits and taxes last 
year, 30 percent up from 1992, XINHUA learned from a national 
machinery industry working meeting which opened here today. 
  The output of engineering machinery, automobiles, electrical 
appliances, heavy-duty mine machinery, copiers, cameras and 
meters increased remarkably while that of agricultural machinery 
and basic mechanical parts declined. 
  A lot of complete equipment was made for key national 
projects last year and more technology-intensive machinery was 
manufactured. 
  The meeting revealed that China is now making a program to 
promote the development of the mechanical industry. By 2010, 
the machinery industry will be the mainstay industry of the 
national economy, with a total output value of 3,000 billion 
yuan, one third of the total of the country's industry. 
  To meet the target, the program proposes several measures: 
build a national unified machinery product market; aid some 
highly- efficient enterprises to take the lead; readjust the 
capital structure by introducing joint-stock system; encourage 
the cooperation and merging among enterprises; support the large 
and medium state-run enterprises to conduct scientific and 
technological research. 
  According to the program, five enterprises with sales volume 
of 10 billion yuan and 20 with five billion yuan will crop up in 
the country by the end of this century; the qualities of some 
mechanical products will reach the world advanced levels.

<F P=106> [Article by Mo Xinyuan (5459 2450 0337): "Deepen Enterprise </F>
Reforms, Increase Efforts Structural Adjustment"] 
  [Text] "We are here to seek a remedy for our rescue 
operations," said delegates to a national conference on the 
textile industry at the Jinxi Guesthouse in Beijing. The remedy 
prescribed by Wu Wenying, chairman of the China Textile 
Federation, on the basis of several days of serious and lively 
discussion at the conference was: Take the initiative to adjust 
and deepen reforms. 
  Textiles is one of our country's oldest traditional 
industries as well as one which moved toward the market early. 
The abolition of clothing coupons in 1983 was a turning point. 
To the majority of consumers, it marked the end once and for 
all of an era of insufficient clothing. To the textile 
industry, it marked the entry of a period of adjustment and 
improvement. "Watering flowers with water pumps used previously 
for large fields"--from this we can imagine the difficulty of 
the adjustment. Due to specific historical reasons in the 
transition from the old to a new system, the adjustment and 
improvement of the industry did not unfold smoothly. This, plus 
excessive burdens on traditional enterprises, led to years of 
increasing costs for a textile industry which was once was a 
great "money earner," and years of falling annual profits and 
taxes. Some industries, such as cotton spinning, have been 
losing money since 1991, that is, for the last three years. 
  The year 1993 was extremely difficult for the textile 
industry. Nationwide, 12 million textile workers worked 
unceasingly, recovering 9.45 billion out of 11.7 billion yuan in 
profit reductions, but still failed to halt the trend of sliding 
economic efficiency. A quarter of national production capacity 
lay idle or semi-inactive, and 2 million workers had no work or 
were waiting for employment. But the year was not totally grim. 
The textile industry in Shanghai adjusted to market demand, 
increased its efforts at industrial adjustment, and achieved 
notable results, giving delegates a glimmer of hope of 
revitalizing the textile industry in these difficult times. 
  Last year, big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao 
took the initiative in adjusting their production structures and 
cutting primary processing capacity. Jiangsu Province has 
quickened the pace of switching primary processing capacity in 
cotton spinning from the south of the province to the northern 
cotton-producing region. Through switching production lines and 
developing tertiary industry, Shanghai Municipality cut its 
cotton spinning production capacity by 230,000 spindles and its 
work force by 110,000. The development of differential land 
rents in the last year reaped 740 million yuan. Meanwhile, many 
enterprises were approved as joint- stock companies, 
shareholding companies with group shareholders, and shareholding 
cooperative firms; there were active efforts to build a modern 
corporate system, strengthen firms' operational powers, and 
quicken the pace of upgrading the industry. 
  "Experience from localities proves that adjustment must be 
unified with reform for any breakthroughs in thinking and 
seizing the initiative." Wu Wenying put forward this line of 
thinking and work focuses for this year's textile reforms: One, 
the textile industry is a competitive industry. From a 
long-term view, enterprises owned exclusively by the state can 
only be a minority, while most state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises must proceed in the direction of 
diversified ownership and change traditional large-scale 
production and small-scale operations. Two, state-owned textile 
enterprises can be reorganized as limited companies or 
shareholding cooperative enterprises, or they can be contracted 
out, leased, or rented to collectives or individuals for 
operations. Three, actively encourage and promote state-owned 
enterprises to reorganize, integrate, or switch to other 
industries in structural innovation, and support successfully 
performing enterprises' efforts to develop large capital-linked 
business conglomerates engaged in cross-regional, inter-trade, 
and diversified production and operations in order to promote 
structural adjustment and strengthen competitiveness in 
international markets. 
  "Do things according to market laws"--with this loud slogan 
adjustment in the textile industry has entered a new year.

publish a new policy for its automotive industry, according to 
He Guangyuan, minister of the machinery industry. 
  He, who is attending the on-going national machinery 
industry 
working conference, said the development of the auto industry is 
directly related to the development of all the country's 
industries, involving roads, communications, education, 
construction and many other fields. He is convinced that 
implementing the new policy will exert significant influence on 
and bring changes to the full range of socio-economic life. 
  According to the ministry's latest statistics, last year 
China produced 1.28 million autos of all kinds, up 20 percent 
from the previous year, of which 234,000 were sedan cars; 
motorcycle output stood at three million, making China the 
world's second largest motorcycle producer after Japan. 
  He said that in the coming few years, major attention will 
be 
paid to the construction and remolding of existing auto 
projects, and the ministry will not approve any new projects 
assembling complete vehicles. 
  Major attention will also be directed to the development of 
key parts for cars, economical cars, special chassis for large, 
medium- sized and small buses, special cargo vehicles, new car 
engines and motorcycle engines. 
  Sources said that in the past 40 years China put only about 
34 billion yuan into the auto industry, and the money has been 
widely divided for an overabundance of local projects. At 
present the one million automotive output capacity is 
distributed across more than 100 auto plants, while the three 
million motorcycles were produced by over 100 plants. 
  At the end of last year China had 1.2 million sedan cars, of 
which 70 percent are imported overseas products. 
  In the late 1980s, China shifted the direction of auto 
development to cars and car parts and defined eight major car 
construction projects. If the planned investment of more than 
22 billion yuan is accomplished at the scheduled time, the eight 
enterprises will be able to produce 780,000 cars in 1997, which 
can basically meet domestic vehicle demands. 
  In the coming years China will also pay attention to the 
development of economical cars to meet the demands of well-to-do 
individuals and families.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese State 
Council has approved the investment of 41.7 billion yuan in 
railway construction this year. 
  Han Zhubin, minister of railways, told a working meeting 
here 
today that due to insufficient funds, the ministry's initial 
plan is to invest 29 billion yuan in capital construction, of 
which 26.65 billion yuan will go to large and medium-sized 
projects, and 2.35 billion yuan to smaller projects. 
  Han said that this year tracks will be laid on 2,100 km of 
new lines, with 234 km operational; 1,335 km of multiple tracks 
will be laid, with 1,293 km operational; and 194 km of rail 
lines will be electrified. 
  Last year China's railway construction used investments of 
22.5 billion yuan, 12 billion yuan more than in the previous 
year. Tracks were laid on 1,437 km of new lines and 1,073 km of 
multiple- track lines. 
  To fill in the gap between available funds and actual demand 
for capital construction, the ministry of railways will further 
expand its use of overseas funds. 
  A preliminary agreement has been reached with the World Bank 
on using its seventh railway construction loans, totalling about 
550 million U.S. dollars; and a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars 
will be taken for the first time from the Asian Development Bank 
for building the Beijing-Kowloon Railway. 
  The ministry is also negotiating with the Japanese 
Government 
on projects to use the fourth group of Japanese yen loans. 
Sources said that the yen loans -- equivalent to over two 
billion U.S. dollars -- will be used for key railway 
construction projects.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Rail Sector Tries Out Bold Corporate </F>
Reform"] 
  [Text] China's railway sector will take "substantive 
steps" in 1994 to establish a modern enterprise system, Railways 
Minister Han Zhubin announced at a national conference that 
opened yesterday in Beijing. 
  The reform will allow 12 railway bureaus across China to 
have 
more say in planning, finance, employment and wages. 
  The decision was based partly on the success of an 
experiment 
carried out at the Jinan Railway Bureau in Shandong Province 
last year. 
  Apart from the railway bureaus, the industrial, construction 
and material firms in the railway system will take bigger 
strides in changing their operating styles, Han said. 
  Moreover, bolder corporate reform will be tried in a limited 
number of railway sub-bureaus, such as the Fuzhou Railway 
Sub-bureau in Fujian Province--mainly by converting them into 
solely-owned or limited liability companies. 
  The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company even plans to turn 
itself into a shareholding firm and perhaps issue stocks 
publicly within the year. 
  The minister also offered to open up Chinese railways wider 
to the outside world now that international capital is eager to 
enter the Chinese railway construction market. 
  The first step will be issuing railway stocks and bonds in 
overseas monetary markets to attract foreign investors to 
railway projects in China. 
  This year the ministry will encourage experts from home and 
aboard to study opening-up tactics and present specific 
co-operation projects. 
  "If we want to speed up rail development, we must actively 
break into the market at both home and abroad," Han told the 
meeting. 
  It is necessary to do away with old taboos, because joining 
the market is the only way to ease the bottlenecks in the 
railway system, which is the State's pillar infrastructure he 
added. 
  In line with this initiative, railway transport units will 
earmark the bulk of their freight cars for shipping key 
materials, such as coal and disaster relief supplies, while the 
remainder will be used for commercial transport under contracted 
freight rates. 
  To meet market demand, the ministry is ready to form a batch 
of specialized firms dealing in container and large-scale cargo 
transport, insurance, telecommunications and tourism. 
  The ministry will initially raise 29 billion yuan ($3.3 
billion) of investment for this year's capital construction, a 
growth of 6.5 billion yuan ($747 million) over last year. 
  The fresh input is to result in 2,100 kilometres of new 
lines, the double tracking of 1,335 kilometres of existing lines 
and electrification of another 194 kilometres. 
  The record-high figures suggested another high tide of 
railway construction this year. 
  The majority of the planned investment will flow into seven 
major railway projects.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- China is expected to 
build 18,000 kilometers of new highways this year, it was 
announced today -- part of a high-gear program for more 
transport facilities. 
  Also in the program is the construction of 59 sea port 
berths 
with an increased handling capacity of more than 30 million tons. 
  These were among projects announced here by Huang Zhendong, 
minister of communications. Speaking at a national working 
meeting, he said that this year China will remold 370 km of 
inland navigation canals and construct 19 river berths to 
increase handling capacity by over three million tons. 
  Huang said that buses and coaches will this year carry 9.3 
billion passengers on the highways. Road cargo volume will 
reach 8.55 billion tons; passengers going by ship are predicted 
to total 320 million, and ship cargo is expected to reach 1.1 
billion tons. 
  The handling volume of major coastal ports will be 630 
million tons to 660 million tons, Huang added. 
  By the end of 1993 the total length of China's operating 
highways had reached 1.075 million km, an increase of 18,000 km 
over the previous year; of which 1,145 km are expressways, an 
increase of 493 km. 
  In addition, last year 19 deep-water berths were built in 
coastal ports, four more than the planned number. A number of 
key projects, such as Qingdao port, Nantong port and Lianyungang 
port, have started operating. 
  Huang said that in the past year international cooperation 
in 
the field of transport had been further strengthened, and 
agreements have been signed with nine countries on land 
transportation, ocean shipping or regional communications 
cooperation. 
  This year the ministry will continue to encourage the 
establishment of foreign-funded land and water transportation 
enterprises, as well as automobile service enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Zhu Yuli, president 
of Aviation Industry of China, announced here today that in the 
coming 10 to 15 years China will implement the "take-off plan" 
for bringing an all-round boom to the country's aviation 
industry. 
  According to the plan, by the year 2000 China will be able 
to 
design and produce its own advanced fighter planes for the 
People's Liberation Army; in the field of civil aircraft, the 
Yun-7, Yun-8 and Yun-12 series will be further improved, the 
target of designing and producing large passenger planes will be 
reached, and the civil aircraft industry will be gradually 
formed. 
  Zhu said that by the end of this century, China's aviation 
industry will gradually construct a complete research and 
production system for advanced helicopters, and be able to 
design and produce turbojet engines for military planes. 
  Zhu said that last year China produced 256 planes of all 
kinds, up 24 percent from the previous year; the output of 
engines increased 27 percent, while the output of missiles 
increased 53.9 percent. 
  Last year the foreign trade volume of the aviation 
industries 
of China exceeded one billion U.S. dollars, including exports of 
870 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
Central Postal Office in Beijing recently announced that an air 
mail service company, which will operate relatively 
independently and which will assume sole responsibility for its 
profits and losses, will be established. In the near future, 
China's postal departments will possess their own airplanes and 
will substantially improve their services, putting an end to the 
past situation of having no express delivery. 
  Since the 1950's, China's postal departments have primarily 
relied on railroad and aviation services to deliver mail. 
Because the volume of mail has risen sharply in recent years -- 
an overall increase of 20 percent annually and an increase in 
express delivery of 71.7 percent and even 100 percent in some 
regions -- the railroad and aviation services can no longer meet 
the demand. Of all complaints received by the express delivery 
postal departments, more than 80 percent were related to losses 
incurred in economy and credibility because of the late delivery 
of mail. In the past, when China had no express delivery 
services, it took an average of 5 to 7 days to deliver a letter 
from one province to another. For a remote province, it could 
take more than 10 days. The postal services have failed to 
correspond with the rapid development of the national economy. 
  At present, the postal departments have to pay airlines a 
considerable amount in freight charges to transport air mail 
items. As this operational system faces many contradictions and 
problems, it cannot meet the increasing needs. The postal 
departments should be capable of carrying out independent 
operations as soon as possible. On one hand, the postal 
departments should consult with the aviation departments and 
continue postal services through the airlines. On the other, 
they should set up an independent postal aviation company in 
order to increase social efficiency. 
  Preparations for the establishment of the new air mail 
service company are going smoothly in various aspects. It is 
being said that the preparatory work for the company has entered 
a new stage.

  [Text] Yichang, January 15 (XINHUA) -- Tenders for the 
building of the principal part of the gigantic water control dam 
at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang -- 
the first-phase digging on the left bank -- were opened here 
this afternoon. 
  This was the first opening of tenders for the construction 
of 
principal parts of the Three Gorges water control dam, which is 
expected to take 17 years to finish. 
  The first-phase digging on the left bank of the Chang Jiang 
consists of three parts -- the first-phase digging for a 
permanent ship lock and the course linking the upper and middle 
reaches, the first-stage digging for a ship lift and a temporary 
ship lock, and the first-phase digging for the workshops and 
dikes of the no. 1 through to no. 6 hydroelectric stations at 
the Three Gorges. 
  Eight large Chinese engineering enterprises or company 
groups 
participated in the tendering and competed for the rights to 
undertake the digging according to conditions set by the China 
Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation when 
calling for the tenders. 
  To guarantee fairness and objectivity, and also to ensure 
that the best engineering enterprises are selected, the China 
International Engineering Consultancy Company has been entrusted 
by the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development 
Corporation to be fully responsible for the assessment of all 
the tenderers this time. 
  It is understood that the assessment will be completed 
before 
the traditional Spring Festival, which falls on February 10. 
The company or group to be awarded the tender is to be decided 
by then.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- China's coastal 
provinces and municipalities are working out plans to further 
tap marine resources. 
  Jiangsu Province has decided to develop marine 
bioengineering 
and set up three marine economic development zones in its 
coastal cities of Lianyungang, Yancheng and Nantong. 
  Liaoning Province will focus on the development of offshore 
oil and sea farms, and Zhejiang Province is to make full use of 
its islands and harbors to develop maritime industry and fishing. 
  China has a 32,000-km coastline, 17,700 sq km of polders and 
24.8 billion tons of continental shelf oil reserves. Its 
territorial waters are as large as one third of the country's 
territory. 
  Until 1979, when China began its national reform, China's 
development of marine resource was limited to fishing and sea 
salt processing. 
  But the past few years have seen an overall development of 
sea resources. Marine product breeding, offshore oil 
exploitation, tourism and marine science are booming. 
  Statistics show that the output value of the national marine 
economy reached 75.5 billion yuan in 1992 and more than 90 
billion yuan last year. 
  The aquatic breeding sea area has been expanded to more than 
500,000 ha, with an annual production output amounting to 2.4 
million tons, ranking first in the world. 
  A number of provinces, including Shandong and Jiangsu, have 
set up hundreds of aquatic product breeding farms. 
  The exploitation of offshore oil and natural gas is in full 
swing. 
  China has concluded 92 contracts on oil co-operation with 55 
companies in 15 countries. These contracts involve 3.6 billion 
U.S. Dollars. 
  As a result of building and improving tourism facilities, 
China's more than 5,000 islands have attracted 9.16 million 
visitors a year, with the annual income from tourism surpassing 
10 billion yuan. 
  China's sea areas abound in tidal and wave energy, as well 
as 
minerals. 
  While making use of these resources, the country has set up 
a 
number of ocean science and technology development zones in 
Qingdao, Dalian and Tianjin to develop high-tech products. 
  A survey shows that coastal areas have built about 300 
deepwater berths forming large port groups along Bohai bay, the 
Chang Jiang estuary and the south China coastal area. 
  At present, China's coastal ports handle 600 million tons of 
cargo a year, and its gross tonnage of ocean-going merchant 
shipping ranks eighth in the world. 
  The past 15 years have seen the country set up five special 
economic zones, a dozen bonded zones and a number of economic 
and technology development zones in its coastal areas. 
  According to the survey, the coastal area, accounting for 13 
percent of the country's total territory, produces more than 60 
percent of the gross national product. 
  At present, the pearl, Chang Jiang and southern Fujian river 
deltas, and the area around the Bohai Sea present a prosperous 
scene of economic development.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (CNS)--China had a good harvest 
last year in spite of many difficulties with the total grain 
output reaching 450 billion kilograms, the cotton output four 
billion kilograms, edible oil 16 million tonnes and meat 37 
million tonnes thanks to people's efforts, better policies and 
fine weather, State Councillor Mr. Chen Junsheng said. 
  China's Minister of Agriculture Mr. Liu Jiang, speaking at a 
national agricultural work meeting, said that this year's goal 
for agriculture and the rural economy was to raise the income of 
farmers steadily and guarantee the supply of agricultural 
products, causing an all-round development of the rural economy 
with the aim of achieving a five percent increase in the per 
capita income of farmers and a grain output of more than 450 
billion kilograms and increases of 850 million kilograms for 
cotton and one million tonnes of edible oil. These goals 
indicate the government's desire to develop the agricultural 
sector and its determination to better the living standards of 
farmers despite many difficulties. 
  Many difficulties have been encountered in raising the 
output 
of grain and cotton because of lower profits and inflation 
affecting production means, resulting in a dampening of farmers' 
enthusiasm for growing these crops. The Minister of Agriculture 
said that China's agriculture lacks a stable basis with the area 
of land under grain cultivation last year down by seven million 
mu over the previous year. The government would, he said, call 
on the relevant departments to see to it that an area of more 
than 1.6 billion mu under crop cultivation is maintained the 
special loans were set aside for 500 counties to support their 
cultivation of grain. 
  Cotton output was down last year resulting in a price hike 
in 
cotton and harmed the textile industry. The government has 
therefore set the area of land under cotton cultivation this 
year at 90 million mu and has decided to raise the purchase 
price of cotton considerably besides arranging loans to 150 
counties for the production of high-quality cotton. 
  The output of meat, poultry, eggs, milk, aquatic products, 
fruit and vegetables, which are important to people's daily 
lives all increased greatly last year and importance is place on 
this year's production as well. Mr. Chen called for a big 
increase of these products, saying that the outer suburbs of the 
country's main cities should increase their areas for vegetable 
cultivation to guarantee supply and keep prices stable.

<F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhou Hongyang (0719 3126 </F>
3152) and XINHUA reporter Lin Hongmei (2651 4767 2734)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- A national meeting on 
comprehensive agricultural development was held in Beijing 
today. The meeting relayed Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's opinion, 
which called on all localities to do practical work and 
earnestly implement the principles on rural work for 
comprehensive agricultural development as outlined by the 
central authorities. At the meeting, State Councillor Chen 
Junsheng stressed: This is a crucial year for China's efforts 
in deepening reform. The State Council has successively 
introduced a series of reform measures such as the establishment 
of taxation, financial, investment, and foreign trade systems. 
This is an important step in establishing the socialist market 
economic system. Furthermore, as comprehensive agricultural 
development is directly linked to reform, this effort is vital 
for ensuring a smooth reform process. Therefore, in 
comprehensive agricultural development, we should focus our 
tasks closely on the overall reform situation and strive to 
produce more grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and vegetables, as 
well as to stabilize and enrich market supplies so as to create 
a better material base for the smooth implementation of reform 
measures. 
  It is understood that investing in large-scale comprehensive 
agricultural development projects is a measure of the state's 
macroeconomic control of agricultural development and a strategy 
for achieving ultimate agricultural modernization under the new 
historical condition. Since reform and opening up, China has 
made breakthroughs in traditional agricultural production 
patterns. We have achieved production efficiency through 
systematic and progressive utilization of resources as well as 
through comprehensive investment and administration, thereby 
creating a new avenue for comprehensive agricultural 
development. In five years of comprehensive agricultural 
development through garden-style farmland cultivation, 
mechanized farming, and the introduction of fine varieties and a 
series of support services, food production increased greatly in 
five provinces in the Huanghe-Huaihe-Haihe Plain, the great 
Northeast Plain, southern Hunan, the Changjiang- Hanjiang Plain, 
central and southern Jiangxi, and project zones in Hainan 
Province. According to statistics, the nationwide increase in 
food production from 1988 to 1992 through comprehensive 
agricultural development included 17.16 billion kg of grain, 
5.04 million dan of cotton [one dan equals to 50 kg], 700,000 
tons of edible oil, and 620,000 tons of meat. Spurred by state 
development projects, Anhui, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, and Henan 
also took the initiative to develop over three million mu of 
"local projects" and "peasants' projects," which greatly 
improved production conditions and increased peasants' income. 
In regions where development projects were undertaken, per 
capita income generally increased by about 200 yuan following 
development. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: We should further understand the 
significance of comprehensive agricultural development, achieve 
the major goal of improving basic conditions for agricultural 
production, and make deeper and wider use of agricultural 
resources. We should effectively improve basic production 
conditions so as to increase the comprehensive production 
capacity for major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, 
edible oil, and meat. We should combine the goals of maintaining 
steady growth for major agricultural products and increasing 
peasants' income. We should establish the efficiency concept 
and attach great importance to the task of helping peasants 
increase their income. 
  As for the next phase of comprehensive agricultural 
development, Chen Junsheng called for vigorous measures to 
increase grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat production; 
effective development of pastoral regions and utilization of 
farmland straw; increase beef and mutton production; and 
large-scale development of selected wastelands. He said: We 
should gradually shift our future investment to the central and 
western regions. 
  Chen Junsheng stressed: We should increase our capital 
investment in comprehensive agricultural development in the 
future. We should use the majority of excess special 
agricultural and forestry taxes collected for comprehensive 
agricultural development. The central government should 
gradually increase its investment as the central financial 
situation improves. We should use more World Bank loans. Bank 
loans for agricultural production should be gradually increased 
yearly on the basis of previous loans. Agricultural banks should 
only increase their input, and not cancel or reduce their loan 
targets for comprehensive agricultural development because of 
bank reform. He asked all localities to mobilize the peasants 
to increase their investment in comprehensive agricultural 
development, utilize excess labor force, and embark on farmland 
capital construction. Meanwhile, governments at all levels 
should adopt scientific, standard management methods for 
development projects, realistically upgrade development 
efficiency, and strive to push comprehensive agricultural 
development to a new stage.

<F P=106> [By Lu Yu-shan (7627 6276 2619): "Zhu Rongji's Position and </F>
`Praising Deng While Degrading Mao'"] 
  [Text] People are always in a holiday mood as the end of 
the Chinese New Year draws near. However, CPC leaders cannot 
prepare for their New Year holidays with ease. They are 
immersed in coping with various changes brought about by the 
reform measures which came into force on 1 January, including 
problems in the new taxation system, the agricultural issue, and 
the price issue. At present, the most pressing problem lies in 
agriculture. 
  Recently, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also in charge of 
agriculture, stressed the need to ensure peasants' livelihood 
while stabilizing grain prices in order to prevent trouble among 
them. The serious attention of the authorities reflects the 
worrisome situation in the countryside. However, the 
authorities did not make public the real situation in the 
countryside. 
  According to reliable official sources, in 1993 the areas 
sown with major crops decreased by the largest margin in the 
last few years. In particular, the area sown with wheat, rice, 
and corn decreased by 2.64 million hectares. Although it is 
expected that the gross grain output remained at the same level, 
if the factor of population growth is also considered, then the 
per capita grain output decreased. In addition, the area sown 
with cotton decreased by 1.38 million hectares and the cotton 
output decreased by about 10 million dan. The area sown with 
oil-bearing crops decreased by 420,000 hectares and the output 
also decreased by about 30 percent. 
  This inevitably led to a decline in peasants' income and 
brought about instability in the countryside. In addition, this 
also caused a sharp increase in grain prices. The central 
authorities are deeply worried about this situation. They think 
that grain prices will increase by at least 10 percent in 1994. 
China always has to import wheat to meet domestic needs, and 
the wheat import in 1994 will have to increase. Moreover, as 
the central government has changed the allocation system into 
the agent system for imported grain, with import subsidies being 
terminated, plus the unification of the foreign exchange system, 
it is expected that the wheat price will inevitably increase 
substantially. On the other hand, as the international corn and 
soya bean prices are increasing, exports will grow. However, 
rice output decreased by a big margin. In some localities it 
was difficult to purchase rice from peasants. Some localities 
even dispatched military troops for forced grain purchases. 
  Another fact that the authorities did not tell the public 
was 
that China's current area sown with grain crops has decreased to 
the warning level, or even below it. The Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery recently delivered a report 
to the central authorities saying that the area of farmland sown 
with grain crops in China must be kept at a level higher than 
1.65 billion mu. However, the area of farmland for growing grain 
crops decreased sharply in the last two years. In 1992, it 
decreased by 24 million mu to 1.66 billion mu, and in 1993 it 
further decreased to 1.62 billion mu, which was lower than the 
warning level. 
  As peasants are uneasy and found it hard to maintain their 
livelihood, the tide of migrant laborers has appeared earlier 
than in previous years. Peasants in poor areas have begun to 
pour into cities, but they did this after Chinese New Year in 
previous years. According to the official information, as early 
as last November four or five streams of migrant laborers 
gradually took form in the country, and they separately flowed 
to Guangdong, Beijing-Tianjin, Shanghai, Harbin, and cities 
along the Chang Jiang. It is expected that the number of 
migrant laborers will exceed 50 million people, and those from 
Sichuan alone will be nearly 10 million people. The spread of 
the "Sichuan troops" all over the country indeed worries the 
authorities. 
  The authorities can only adopt two countermeasures. First, 
opening the state granaries to keep the grain prices stable. 
Normally, the Chinese Government stores grain for the nation's 
consumption in six months, so there is sufficient grain in 
stock. It is not difficult to tide over the demand peak period 
around the Chinese New Year. However, China will have to 
quicken grain imports in the following months of this year. 
Another measure is to print more bank notes to purchase grain 
from peasants. In October 1993 the amount of newly printed bank 
notes exceeded the major mark of 100 billion yuan. As the State 
Council was determined to solve the IOU problem, it allocated 30 
billion yuan to local governments. However, the local 
governments said that the funds were still insufficient and 
required the central authorities to increase the allocations. 
Finally, the central authorities could not but allocate another 
50 billion yuan to ensure that the first 30 billion yuan could 
be delivered to the hands of peasants. It seemed that while the 
IOU problem was resolved or mitigated, fuel would have been 
added to inflation. 
  All such unstable factors forced the central authorities to 
seek various countermeasures. The pressure on Zhu Rongji, who 
is also in charge of agriculture, was even greater. Recently it 
was rumored that his status might have become worrisome (for 
example, the "macrocontrol" for which he bears the main 
responsibility has quietly come to an end), and the outside 
world is now wondering if he is in a predicament. However, 
informed sources said that Zhu Rongji's position was still 
rather firm and had not been shaken or changed. Although he may 
withdraw from the office of governor of the People's Bank of 
China (and may be succeeded by Dai Xianglong, currently first 
vice governor of the bank), this is in fact an arrangement made 
long ago. When Zhu Rongji took the banks' governorship, it was 
known among the insiders that this was only a transitional step, 
because the situation at that time required Zhu's authority for 
adopting some urgent and stern measures. 
  In addition, Zhu Rongji continued to take charge of the 
economic work without change. Although Li Peng frequently 
appeared on public occasions in the last few months, Zhu Rongji 
was still one of the principal officials deciding the economic 
reform policies in 1994. Otherwise, he would not have said that 
macrocontrol was not contradictory to Deng Xiaoping's idea about 
accelerating development. The economic officials also gave 
tacit consent to the option of alternately tightening and 
loosening control, because the disorder would appear if control 
is too loose and the economy would be stifled if control is too 
tight. However, such policy was different from the previous 
retrenchment policy. Instead, it was just a means of more 
flexibly alternating "tight control" and "loose control." 
  Another issue that is now worrying the central authorities 
is 
the confusion in people's minds and the tendency to independent 
administration among the local authorities. Therefore, in the 
activities of commemorating the 100th anniversary of Mao 
Zedong's birth last month, the authorities again stressed the 
values advocated by Mao. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, negating 
Mao is equal to negating the party, so they must adhere to this 
even if the sky is falling down. However, at the same time 
there was a "criticizing-Mao campaign," which was not officially 
called this. That was the large-scale study of Volume 3 of Deng 
Xiaoping's works promoted by the authorities. 
  In fact, in the study of Volume 3 of Deng's works, the 
authorities concerned relayed Deng Xiaoping's recent 
instructions on foreign, economic, and political affairs. Deng 
stressed that China has entered the era of peaceful 
construction, so there should be no life-and-death struggle 
between China and the international community. Instead, it is 
an era of interdependence. China's economic construction has 
included a variety of operation forms and management systems, 
and is no longer in a "large monolithic mode." To put it more 
plainly, China now needs to replace Mao's theories about "taking 
class struggle as the key link," about "preparing against the 
unavoidable world war," and about the planned economy, with 
Deng's ideas that "keeping stability is an overwhelming task" 
and his theory about "building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics." 
  Therefore, the current activities of "praising Mao" only 
served the purpose of consolidating the legitimacy of the CPC's 
rule, and the criticism of Mao also served the same purpose, 
that is, consolidating the CPC's ruling position through 
correcting Mao's mistakes.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government has set a target of keeping its total acreage of 
cultivated land at over 1.83 billion mu (120 million ha) at the 
end of this century. 
  To meet this target China has to bring down its average 
annual loss of farmland below 2.5 million mu in the remaining 
seven years of the century, according to a senior official with 
the State Land Administration. 
  In an interview with XINHUA today the official said that 
China has seen a sharp reduction of cultivated land in recent 
years, due to the overheated boom in real estate development and 
economic zones. 
  According to an estimate, China's cultivated land accounts 
for 13.2 percent of the country's total land area. The per 
capita land area under cultivation stands at 1.8 mu, or 41 
percent of the world's average per capita figure. 
  The official noted that China has had a net loss of four 
million mu of cultivated land annually since 1991. 
  However, thanks to vigorous measures taken by the 
government, 
particularly after the nationwide delimitation of the protection 
areas for farmland in 1993 in line with the state's agriculture 
law, China has made headway in checking the loss of cultivated 
land. 
  According to incomplete statistics, 27 of the mainland's 30 
administrative divisions have started delimitation of protected 
areas under cultivation. 
  In the pace-setting provinces of Zhejiang, Hubei and Hebei 
the farmland acreage under protection accounts for 96 percent, 
60 percent and 62 percent, respectively, of their total 
cultivated land areas. 
  Within the protection areas no encroachment of any kind is 
allowed except with special permission, said the official. 
  As a result, random occupation and exploitation of 
cultivated 
land has been effectively curbed, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by staff correspondent Jiang Xia (3068 1115): "A </F>
`Hot Spot' From Beginning to End -- Roundup on Development of 
Agriculture and Rural Economy"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 was almost the year of agriculture 
and the rural economy. From cashing peasants' IOU's early in 
the year to the unveiling of a series of State Council grain 
production and sales polices, from the much publicized effort to 
reduce peasants' burdens to the convocation of the Central Rural 
Work Conference to the year-end fluctuations in grain and oil 
prices -- all of these attracted the attention of the whole 
society. It is no exaggeration to say that agricultural and 
rural economic development ran through 1993 as "hot spots." 
<H5>  Agriculture: High Yield, High Quality, Faster Pace </H5>
  Agricultural production reaped bumper harvests again with 
the 
annual grain output hitting 456.4 billion kg, breaking the 
all-time high by 10.2 billion kg. Total output of oil bearing 
crops reached 17.61 tonnes, 1.2 million tonnes more than the 
previous record. Though the total sown area under grains 
decreased slightly, average output per mu rose by eight kg. 
Major agriculture and sideline products continued to grow, 
except cotton and sugar crops, which dropped in output. Total 
output of meat, eggs, dairy, and aquatic products is expected to 
rise by more than 5.5 percent, 6.4 percent, 7 percent, and 10 
percent respectively on the previous year, assuring the whole 
country of a rich supply of food. Most encouragingly, 
agricultural production has met market demands, stepped up 
efforts in structural adjustment, and taken new steps in the 
direction of high yield, high quality, and high efficiency. In 
response to falling prices of early crops like long grains due 
to a slow market and stockpiles, and rising prices for 
under-supplied quality grains, soybeans, and mixed cereals, 
localities all stepped up efforts to adjust their crop mix. 
Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that national 
grain farmland shrank by 26 million mu in 1993, down 5.5 percent 
from the previous year. In particular, the area of early long 
grains, inferior in rice quality, was cut by over 12 million mu, 
down 9.5 percent from the previous year. Soybeans acreage and 
other mixed cereals increased by over 34 million mu, up 20 
percent. Quality crop acreage extended to some 100 million mu, 
accounting for over 30 percent of all rice paddies. Quality 
wheat acreage grew by over 3 million mu to some 16 million mu. 
Meanwhile, there has been faster development in well-known, 
special, quality, new, and rare breeds in the breeding industry. 
<H3>  Township and Town Enterprises: Parallel Growth and Strong 
Momentum in East, Middle, West Regions; Good Momentum </H3>
  Township and town enterprises continued to maintain a strong 
growth momentum and parallel growth in economic efficiency. 
Total income from realized operations and sales last year is 
expected to be 2.6 trillion yuan [figure as published], total 
profits and taxes of 255 billion yuan, and total output value of 
2.9 trillion yuan, a 40-percent increase on the same period a 
year earlier for all three items. 
  Foreign exchange earnings from exports grew by leaps and 
bounds. The total delivered export value was 190 billion yuan, 
up 60 percent from the previous year and accounting for about 45 
percent of the total value of the country's exported commodities. 
  Firms continued to expand in scale. There were some 400 
township and town enterprises in 1993 whose annual output value 
topped 100 million or above, 300 had sales over 100 million yuan 
or above, and close to 100 delivered exports of 100 million yuan 
or above. 
  Numbers employed rose considerably. There are about 112 
million workers in township and town enterprises, 6 million more 
than in the previous year. Over 60 percent of the net increase 
in peasants' per-capita net income came from township and town 
enterprises, 29 billion yuan was used to support various rural 
projects, and 13 billion yuan was provided in agricultural 
development funds in a scheme to encourage the subsidization and 
development of prefectural agriculture by industry, respectively 
up 50 percent and 20 percent on the previous year. 
  One important characteristic of last year's development in 
township and town enterprises was a new situation in the 
economically developed eastern region, where scale, standards, 
quality, and economic efficiency all rose. In the middle and 
western regions, the development pace quickened. Statistics 
from the Ministry of Agriculture show that in 1993, rural 
surplus labor absorbed by township and town enterprises in the 
central and western regions in 1993 accounted for 60 percent of 
the new jobs provided by all of the country's township and town 
enterprises, the total output value of township and town 
enterprises in the central and western regions grew by about 400 
billion yuan, about 40 percent of the net growth in national 
output and up over 60 percent on the previous year, higher than 
the average national growth rate of 10 percentage points. 
Meanwhile, total output value, income from operations and 
sales, total profits and taxes, and the total number of workers 
in township and town enterprises in the central and western 
regions all saw a rise on the previous year in their share of 
township and town enterprises nationally. This was a remarkable 
achievement. 
<H5>  Rural Reforms: More Explicit Market Orientation </H5>
  The main characteristic of rural reforms last year was an 
enhanced role for market mechanisms and a further deepening of 
marketization. At present, apart from a few items, such as 
cotton and tobacco leaves, operations and prices of all other 
agricultural products have been deregulated, chief among which 
was basically the national deregulation of grain purchase and 
sale prices. Reform in the grain purchase and sale price 
system, the main agricultural product of the national economy 
and the people's livelihood, had gone through years of 
exploration, suffered many reversals, and had come to be seen as 
the last bastion of the planned economy and the hardest one to 
conquer. The important progress of last year's deregulation of 
grain prices, therefore, will undoubtedly provide the peasants' 
efforts to tailor production to market demands with greater room 
for maneuver. 
  The cooperative shares system has come a long way in rural 
areas. About 10 percent of township and town enterprises around 
the country are pursuing the cooperative shares or joint-stock 
system, with a considerable increase in the number of business 
conglomerates, there being nearly 100 of them nationally. Areas 
and counties experiencing a more extensive range of the share 
cooperation system have appeared in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and 
Shandong, offering much new experience. 
  A series of new policies unveiled by the central rural 
conference was aimed at deepening reforms, such as extending the 
duration of land contracts, permitting paid transfers, and 
buying in shares of land contracts, and reforms in the urban 
residence status system are playing a role in optimal resource 
allocation in rural areas. 
<H3>  There Are Still Hidden Problems: We Cannot Afford To Grow 
Complacent </H3>
  Early in 1993, many worried about agriculture. But by the 
end of the year, the situation was such that people were 
relieved, which was a hard-won achievement: Leadership over 
agriculture and rural work from the central to the local level 
was strengthened, a series of policies and measures aimed at 
protecting agriculture were unveiled, policies were enforced, 
peasants' burden reduced, and practical production problems 
solved. The weather helped too: There was basically fine 
weather throughout last year, with no major climatic disasters 
during key growth periods, which ensured bumper harvests. 
  There are still hidden problems behind the favorable 
developments in agriculture and the rural economy in 1993, and 
some deep contradictions gradually emerged. In 1992, peasants' 
net per- capita income grew by 5.9 percent, a sign of recovery. 
In 1993, the increase in peasants' income, after factoring in 
price increases, again slowed to 2 percent from the previous 
year, a far cry from the 12 percent per-capita increase in 
income for urban residents, which widened the gap between them. 
Agriculture, especially grain and cotton production, suffered 
from low efficiency, which remained a headache for agriculture 
and a main cause of the peasants' slow income growth. 
  Pressure on employment in rural areas is increasing. There 
is a surplus labor force of 100 million in rural areas, to which 
another 13 million is added each year, while there are only 
limited ways to channel this surplus labor force. Township and 
town enterprises are also absorbing this labor force at an 
increasingly slower rate. 
  Methods of regulation and control available to the state are 
far from enough, such as insufficient inputs to agriculture, 
capital drain, occupation of farmland, and unperfected 
macroregulatory control, information, and guidance systems for 
the demand and supply of agricultural products. 
  In 1994, reforms in the economic structure are entering a 
stage of attack on all fronts and are taking on key problems, 
and the reform and development of agriculture and the rural 
economy is facing more complicated external circumstances and 
unprecedented opportunities and challenges! 
  We hope that rural areas will forever remain "hot spots!"

<F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F>
(6392 6647 1987)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Thanks to efforts 
exerted by leading authorities and the hundreds of millions of 
peasants in the country, China's agricultural and rural economy 
continued to grow in 1993. According to information recently 
released by the State Statistics Bureau, even though the 
nation's total sown acreage in 1993 was smaller than that of a 
year before, the nation's total grain output in 1993 reached 
456.4 billion kg, topping the previous record by 10.2 billion 
kg, and the average per-mu yield increased by eight kg. The 
substantial per-unit increase was unusual in recent years. 
  Last year, to provide stronger leadership over agriculture 
and rural affairs, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council called a series of meetings to promulgate grain 
production and marketing policies, to promote grain sales, to 
examine development of township and town enterprises in central 
and western China, and to review the situation of cotton 
production and rural affairs. They also put forth many effective 
measures for encouraging grain and cotton production, reducing 
peasants' burdens, and making sure "IOU's" were not issued in 
lieu of cash payments for agricultural purchases. Following the 
central authorities' guidelines, all local governments strove to 
do everything possible to reduce peasants' burdens; to increase 
agricultural investment in terms of capital, supplies, and 
technical expertise; and to strengthen the role of agriculture 
as the foundation of the national economy. Their efforts as 
well as the good weather facilitated the bumper harvests and the 
sustained economic growth in rural areas. 
  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, except for the 
output of cotton and sugar, which registered a decline, the 
output of all other agricultural goods and nonstaple foods 
continued to increase last year: The total output of 
oil-bearing crops reached 17.61 million tonnes, topping the 
previous record by 1.2 million tonnes; and people's greater 
demands for nonstaple foods were ensured with the increased 
supply of meat, dairy goods, eggs, and acquatic products, the 
total output of which were expected to top that of the year 
before by 5.5, 6.4, 7.0, and 10.0 percent respectively. As the 
pillar of the rural economy, township and town enterprises, in 
addition to maintaining their strong developmental momentum, 
registered growth in both output and returns last year. It is 
expected that the sales of the nation's township and town 
enterprises would reach 2.6 trillion [wan yi 8001 0310] yuan, 
the total profit taxes they paid reached 255 billion yuan, and 
the total output reached 2.9 trillion yuan last year, or a 40 
percent growth from those of the year before in all three cases. 
What is even more eye-catching is the fact that the total value 
of export goods which township and town enterprises had 
delivered reached 190 billion yuan, topping that of the year 
before by 60 percent, or approximately 45 percent of the goods 
which the nation purchased for export. Owing to the boom in all 
rural sectors and broader channels for peasants' production, 
peasants' net per capita income last year was expected to reach 
880 yuan. Allowing for inflation, the increase will be about 
two percent over that of the year before. 
  The features of agricultural production in various parts of 
the country last year were greater efforts for restructuring the 
agricultural pattern to accommodate market needs, as well as the 
noticeable high output of products of good quality and high 
returns. Last year was the first year in which all sectors of 
the nation's agricultural production moved toward the market, 
and the hundreds of millions of peasants planned their 
production according to market needs instead of following the 
state's mandatory plans as before. In addition to expanding the 
acreage for economic crops, peasants in various parts of the 
country also readjusted the varieties of cereal crops, and 
expanded the acreage of crops which yielded higher returns and 
had promising market prospects. According to the Ministry of 
Agriculture, in 1993 the acreage of early nonglutinous rice of 
poor quality was downsized by more than 12 million mu and the 
acreage of rice of good quality was expanded to more than 100 
million mu, or over 30 percent of the total rice acreage; the 
acreage of quality wheat was expanded to more than 16 million 
mu, or over three million mu more than the year before; and the 
acreage of soybean and other minor miscellaneous cereal crops 
was expanded by 20 percent, exceeding 34 million mu. Meanwhile, 
the breeding of well-known, special, quality, new, and rare 
products developed quickly. 
  An official of the Ministry of Agriculture said that certain 
factors, which should not be ignored, are still obstructing 
China's agricultural and economic development. The most 
conspicuous problems are: Low returns from agricultural 
production, especially grain and cotton production, widening gap 
between yields from industrial and agricultural goods, and 
sluggish increase in peasants' income; incompatibility between 
the development and popularization of agricultural techniques on 
the one hand and the requirement for faster agricultural growth 
on the other; growing needs for jobs as a result of the annual 
increase of over 10 million able-bodied individuals in rural 
areas; and the state's imperfect macroeconomic regulation and 
control over agriculture, undeveloped rural systems of economic 
information, and the lack of a fast and efficient market 
guidance for agricultural production. To expedite development 
of the market economy in rural areas, the vast number of cadres 
and masses are now looking for solutions to these problems while 
deepening reform.
