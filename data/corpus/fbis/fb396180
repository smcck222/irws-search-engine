<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Ma Ling (7456 3781): "China Maps </F>
Out a Plan To Reform the Residential Household Registration 
System"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--According to the 
department concerned, the China mainland's residential household 
registration system will be reformed. In this connection, a 
plan has been drafted and submitted to the State Council, and it 
is expected to be officially approved and implemented this year. 
  The existing residential household system is the 
"double-track structure" which has been practiced for several 
decades. In fact it is a system under which rural household 
status is distinguished from nonrural household status by the 
criterion of whether one enjoys the privilege of being supplied 
with commodity grain or not. This form of division has made it 
extremely difficult for a household with rural resident status 
to transfer to the nonrural category. A peasant can hardly have 
his rural resident status changed even if he has been working in 
a town for several decades. So he is not entitled to the 
privileges and treatment of other urban residents with nonrural 
resident status. 
  How is China going to do away with the constraints that the 
existing residential household registration system imposes on 
social evolution and social stability, in the wake of rapid 
economic development? This question has aroused debate within 
academic circles over the past few years, the focus being placed 
on whether cities should open their doors wide to peasants and 
residents of small towns. One view holds that in the wake of 
urbanization and industrialization, it is necessary to provide a 
fair environment to enable people to travel and choose 
occupations freely. This can speed up the development process 
on the one hand and, on the other, alleviate the uncomfortable 
feeling on the part of peasants who do not have a sense of 
belonging to the cities where they are living. Another view 
holds that once the 800 million Chinese peasants are allowed to 
move freely, it will inevitably cause a great urban population 
explosion much more dreadful than what has already taken place 
in Mexico city. 
  Since there are grounds for both views, the authorities 
concerned, after rather long study, have finally adopted a 
compromise that incorporates a gradual, progressive reform. 
Under this program, the existing "double-track" residential 
household registration system will be replaced by a new 
registration system based on three population control 
categories, namely, permanent residential household, temporary 
residential household, and dependent residential household; the 
conventional mode of identity verification by the residential 
household registration book will be replaced by the identity 
certifying system with the resident identity card as the 
principal proof of identity; rural and nonrural categories will 
be distinguished by domicile and occupation; and any 
transference of residential household registration will be based 
on consideration of the housing and living conditions of the 
city concerned and subject to policy regulation and control. 
  Some attempts to reform the conventional residential 
household registration system have been made earlier in many 
localities, even in some counties in the suburbs of Beijing. 
Some localities have begun selling urban household registration 
quotas to peasants, some localities have introduced a "blue seal 
household registration quota" system specially designed for 
immigrants of the investment category, while some others have 
introduced a "green card" system, and so on. All these 
practices have been endorsed by the Beijing authorities.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- A large number of 
Chinese cities are approaching international standards in terms 
of urban construction, which has resulted in huge enhancement of 
the state's overall municipal functions. 
  In 1993 alone, China completed investment of 44.7 billion 
yuan on fixed assets in municipal construction, an increase of 
57.9 percent over the previous year, according to Hou Jie, 
minister of construction. 
  Across the country, large and medium-sized cities have 
doubled capacities for supplying water and gas to citizens, 
achieving average daily supplies of 6 million tons of water and 
1.6 million cubic meters of gas. 
  The country's daily urban sewage disposal capacity has 
increased to 800,000 tons, two times the 1992 figure. Also, an 
additional 30,000 kilometers of road were built in 1993. 
  Many big and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, 
Guangzhou and Shenyang are collecting funds specially for 
boosting the construction of public facilities. 
  At present, a number of huge municipal works have been 
completed nationwide, including the Beijing airport expressway, 
the huge Shanghai Yangpu river bridge and the sewage disposal 
project of the Suzhou river as well as water, power and gas 
projects scattered among the capital cities of Hefei, 
Shijiazhuang, Dalian, Qingdao, Ningpo and Xiamen. 
  According to the minister, China also achieved marked 
results 
in utilizing foreign capital for urban construction. Some 73 
cities nationwide had received loans totaling 2.595 billion U.S. 
dollars from 16 countries and international financial 
organizations worldwide. 
  These loans helped finance such municipal works as subways, 
overpasses and garbage disposal systems. 
  The minister said that in 1993, China invested a total of 
306 
billion yuan in urban housing construction, up 78.2 percent over 
the 1992 figure, and completed a record 200 million sq m [square 
meters] of floor space. 
  Up to now, 172 cities nationwide have expanded their average 
per capita living space to above 8 sq m. The nationwide housing 
shortage has been eased to a great extent, according to the 
minister.

<F P=106> ["Earnestly Study the `Decision' of the Third Plenary </F>
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee" column by Liu 
Zhifeng, vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring 
Economy: "Speed Up Residential Housing Reform in Towns and 
Cities, Promote Development of Residential Housing Construction"] 
  [Text] For many years past, the party and the government 
have allocated large amounts of funds for urban housing 
construction but this has still failed to meet the basic housing 
needs of urban residents. A major reason is that there were 
many problems with the old housing system. It is now necessary 
to quicken the reform of the urban housing system, increase the 
input to the construction of residential housing, bring about a 
benign cycle in the circulation of funds for housing 
construction, accelerate house construction, and raise the 
housing conditions for the urban residents to a comparatively 
wealthy level by the year 2000. This will: Help reduce the 
social burdens borne by the enterprises and institutions and 
promote the transformation of the enterprise management 
mechanisms and the establishment of a modern enterprise system. 
This is also of great significance in promoting the: 
Development of the real estate and other relevant industries; 
adjustment of the economic structure; sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy; and in promoting 
social fairness and checking irregularities in the field of 
housing distribution. 
<H3>  I. Major Progress Has Been Made in Our Country's Housing 
Reform </H3>
  In 1980, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward a general housing 
reform concept which included the sale of public housing, the 
adjustment of rents, and measures to encourage individuals to 
buy and build houses. According to this idea, the reform of the 
urban housing system in our country has been continuously making 
progress through explorations and summing up experience in 
practice. In particular, since the Second National Work 
Conference on Reform of the Urban Housing System in October 
1992, major progress has been made in our country's housing 
reform, which has advanced from the stage of pilot schemes in a 
small number of cities and on a small scale to the new stage of 
comprehensive and across-the-board reforms and the overall 
climate for housing reform has taken shape. Some large and 
medium state-owned enterprises took the lead in substantially 
raising rents; selling public housing at cost price; setting up 
housing development companies; separating the functions of 
building, distributing, repairing, and managing houses from the 
functions of the enterprises; and promoting the the three major 
reforms in the enterprises and the transformation of the 
operation mechanisms. At the same time, the system of housing 
funds has also been adopted widely. At present, the system of 
housing funds has been adopted by 104 of the 194 cities at and 
above the prefectural level in the country. The housing 
financial system has also been developed. The local governments 
at all levels and the enterprises and institutions have 
increased their input to housing construction. They attach 
importance to the development of housing projects which are 
affordable and functional. The funds for housing construction 
are raised through a variety of forms and the projects are 
started using various methods of cooperation. This has 
quickened the settlement of the people's housing difficulties 
and has markedly improved the urban residents' living 
conditions. In 1980, the per capita floor area of living 
quarters for urban residents was 3.9 square meters; in 1992, 
this had increased to 7.1 square meters. Most cities have 
offered housing to households which originally had only less 
than 2 square meters per capita of floor space. 
<H5>  II. Basic Framework of New Urban Housing System </H5>
  According to the objective of establishing the socialist 
market economic structure, the State Council's leading group for 
housing reform set out a seven-point guideline for reform of the 
urban housing system and for the new system. 
  1. Changing the original system, under which the state and 
employer institutions bore total responsibility for the 
investment in housing construction, and replacing it with a new 
system whereby the state, institutions, and individuals jointly 
make investments according to a reasonable ratio. That is, the 
state exempts the land use fee for the construction of 
affordable and functional housing projects, the employer 
institutions help the employees set up housing funds, and 
individuals bear the costs of construction. 
  2. Changing the original system whereby employer 
institutions are responsible for building, distributing, 
repairing, and managing residential housing and replacing it 
with a new system under which specialized institutions perform 
such functions in society. 
  3. Changing the system of distributing housing as welfare 
benefit in kind and replacing such welfare benefit with monetary 
wages. 
  4. Establishing an integrated system for the supply of 
affordable and functional housing to households with ordinary 
income as part of the social security program and also a system 
for the supply of commodity houses to households with high 
incomes. 
  5. Adopting the housing funds system across the board. 
  6. Developing the housing financial services, including 
savings for housing construction, individual housing mortgages, 
installment payments, and housing insurance. A housing credit 
system composed of both policy-determined credit and commercial 
credit arrangements should be established. 
  7. Establishing a regular market for housing transactions 
and a market for housing maintenance and management; developing 
institutions which offer housing management, decoration, and 
maintenance services; and improving the related administrative 
and taxation systems. 
  According to the requirement laid down by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on quickening the 
urban housing reform and promoting the process of housing 
commercialization and the development of housing construction, 
we shall strive to basically establish the new urban housing 
system in the 1990's. Localities with favorable conditions 
should take the lead in doing this. 
<H5>  III. Basic Conception for Accelerating Housing Reform </H5>
  Although great achievements have been made in the field of 
housing reform, we still face some prominent problems. In 
particular, since the second half of 1992, the housing reform 
has been facing two major difficulties: 
  First, it is hard to further raise the rents. According to 
the original plan, by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, 
rents for residential housing will cover the three major costs, 
namely, the costs of maintenance and management as well as the 
depreciation charges; by the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, 
rents should reflect the level of the five factors, namely, the 
maintenance charges, the management charges, the depreciation 
charges, the investment returns, and the property taxes. 
However, at present, in the areas where housing reform has been 
carried out, the average level of rents is only around 0.3 yuan 
per square meter, even lower than the 1992 maintenance cost of 
0.75 yuan per square meter. It will be rather difficult to 
attain the planned target (the 1992 level of the three factors 
reached 1.92 yuan per square meter). When considering the action 
of raising rents, many city governments were facing financial 
difficulties with the other local governments and the 
enterprises as well as the inadequate bearing capacity of the 
residents. This made it hard for them to make the decision. 
Other factors making it hard to raise rents include the 
wait-and-see attitude of some local governments which do not 
have a firm determination to advance the reform. 
  Second, the policy of selling houses at the original 
standard 
price has poor adaptability and lacks the dynamic adjustment 
mechanism for the transition to selling houses at a slight 
profit. According to the existing housing reform policy, houses 
may be sold at a standard price or at the market price (the 
standard price includes the cost of the houses proper, the cost 
of requisitioning land, and the cost of resettlement). In 
practice, however, being representative of the state's unified 
policy, the standard price can hardly be suited to the concrete 
conditions of various localities. For example, in the northern 
areas, the walls are thick and there are heating facilities 
inside the houses. That is, the costs of the houses are higher. 
However, being constrained by the conditions of economic 
development, workers' income is not high; on the contrary, the 
walls of the houses in the southern areas are thinner and there 
are no heating facilities, so the costs of the houses are lower 
but workers' incomes there are not low. If the price is fixed 
according to the costs of the houses, it is hard to sell the 
houses in cities where the house costs are high but workers' 
income is low. In addition, the conditions in large and medium 
cities are quite different from those in small cities. 
According to some surveys, in 1992, the housing standard price 
in large and medium cities was 900 yuan per square meter. A new 
two-bedroom apartment unit with a floor space of 56 square 
meters would be sold at more than 50,000 yuan. This is not 
affordable to a worker household with average income. However, 
in some small cities, the house construction costs are lower. 
Being compared with workers' payment ability, the houses may be 
sold at a price a little higher than the standard price but 
because of the policy about the standard price, houses in these 
localities are still sold at the standard price which even 
excludes the costs of land requisition and resident 
resettlement. This is not conducive to the transition to 
slightly profitable prices. Moreover, the objective of the 
housing reform is to eventually realize housing 
commercialization and to form a system of selling houses at 
slightly profitable prices and at market prices. The standard 
price is only a transitional form but the standard prices 
composed of the two factors is static and cannot be gradually 
replaced with slightly profitable prices along with the 
development of the economy. 
  According to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and the current conditions of the 
housing reform, as well as the current financial, enterprise, 
and macroeconomic situations, and in accordance with the 
requirements of establishing a new housing system, the State 
Council's leading group for housing reform set out the 
basic concept for accelerating the reform of the urban 
housing system: While simultaneously selling, renting, and 
building houses, we should focus efforts on selling the existing 
public housing; increase the intensity of the rental reform; 
adopt the housing funds system across the board; speed up the 
construction of affordable and functional houses; formulate 
backup policies; foster markets; accelerate the process of 
housing commercialization and socialization; establish a new 
urban housing system suited to the requirements of the socialist 
market economy at an early date; and strive to raise the housing 
conditions of the urban residents to the level of being 
comparatively well-off by the year 2000. The adoption of such a 
basic concept mainly gives consideration to the following 
issues. 
  1. The housing reform must be quickened. If 
the housing reform is not advanced, a chain of serious problems 
may arise. First, if the housing reform is delayed any longer 
state finances and the enterprises will have to increase the 
subsidies and the cost of the reform will increase. According 
to the calculations, raising the rents to the sum of the five 
factors in 1987 would have required 27 billion yuan in 
subsidies; in 1990, this increased to 41.6 billion yuan; and in 
1992, this sharply increased to 67 billion yuan, increasing by 8 
billion yuan each year. [figures as published] Second, if the 
housing reform is not advanced, the existing public houses will 
still not be the wealth of the state and the enterprises, but 
their "burdens." By the end of 1992, there was a total of 2.7 
billion square meters of public housing. If its value was 350 
yuan per square meter, then the 2 percent losses each year would 
amount to 18.9 billion yuan. In addition, the state and the 
enterprises still had to spend 7-8 billion yuan on maintaining 
and managing these houses. That is to say, the state and the 
enterprises would lose 25.9 to 26.9 billion yuan a year. Third, 
in some cities and localities, because the rents could not be 
raised and the houses could not be sold at the standard price, 
some institutions made their own policies for selling houses. 
Although the quantity of houses being sold was not large, more 
and more localities decided to sell houses. In the course of 
selling houses, the prices were not regularized and the policies 
were not unified, thus institutions and localities vied with 
each other in selling houses at a lower price. This was not 
conducive to the long-term housing development in the same area, 
nor to the healthy advances of the housing reform in the whole 
country. It was also not conducive to the reinforcement and 
improvement of macroeconomic control. Fourth, if the housing 
reform is not quickened, it will not be possible to establish 
the new housing system and this is unfavorable to the expansion 
of housing construction and the improvement of urban residents' 
housing conditions. This will seriously affect the fulfillment 
of the plan to raise the housing conditions of urban residents 
to the level of being comparatively well-off by the year 2000 
and will be unfavorable to the transformation of the enterprise 
operation mechanism and the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system. 
  2. The realistic option for quickening the housing 
reform is to lay stress on selling the existing public houses 
and to simultaneously promote sales, rental, and 
construction. The main means of housing commercialization 
is to raise rents and to sell houses. However, in the last few 
years, the cost of housing maintenance and management and the 
construction costs of new houses have been increasing rapidly. 
The increase rate of rents could not keep pace with the 
increase rate of prices and the effects of rent increases were 
substantially offset by price increases. Moderate rent 
increases can hardly break through the deadlocked situation in 
the housing reform. If stress is laid on selling existing 
public houses this will, first of all, help enliven the housing 
stock, quicken the recovery of the funds, promote housing 
construction, and turn the public housing in stock from a 
"burden" to assets in real terms. If 10 percent of the existing 
2.7 billion square meters of public housing was sold at 350 yuan 
per square meter, 94.5 billion yuan will be recovered. Second, 
this will help increase the intensity of the rental reform. 
After part of the existing public houses are sold, rent 
increases will affect fewer workers and the funds needed for 
subsidizing rents will decrease. This will be conducive to 
substantial rent increases. Third, when house sales and rent 
increases are effected at the same time in a well- coordinated 
reform, the current deadlocked situation in which "rents cannot 
be raised and houses cannot be sold" will be changed. If rents 
cannot be raised, it is certain that nobody will be willing to 
buy houses and houses will thus not sell well or will have to be 
sold at lower prices. In the next few years, if the policies 
for selling houses and raising rents are announced and put into 
practice at the same time, and if the ratio of prices to rents 
is properly adjusted every year to make workers feel that it is 
more worthwhile to buy houses sooner rather than later, then 
house sales will become the breakthrough point of the housing 
reform and will push rents to a higher level. Thus, a favorable 
cycle in which sales promote rent increases and vice versa, will 
take shape. As the state built and distributed houses in a 
unified way, and the monetary wages for workers' housing 
consumption were deducted from the total wage expenditure and 
replaced with the distribution of real houses to workers, the 
public housing in stock cannot be generally regarded as state 
assets. If prices are fixed reasonably, and if there are strict 
rules for secondary housing transactions, then the state asset 
erosion problem will not exist. Fifth, at present, urban 
residents have a strong sense of property rights and also have 
better financial conditions, so the sales of public housing will 
be suited to their wish to purchase and own their own property. 
  3. In order to promote regularized housing sales in 
various localities, it is necessary to readjust the policies for 
house sales. At present, most localities do not sell 
houses at the standard price specified by the housing reform 
policy, and the prices are generally too low. To solve the 
problems in the original house sales policy, the new policy 
should be formulated according to workers' wage levels so that 
prices may be fixed according to their financial capacity and 
can be adjusted according to the differences in the level of 
economic development in all parts of the country. The lowest 
price for house sales should be fixed each year and favorable 
unified policies should be formulated, thus preventing some 
localities from selling public housing at unreasonably low 
prices. It is necessary to establish the dynamic adjustment 
mechanism for the gradual transition from the standard price to 
the slightly profitable prices along with economic development, 
thus encouraging workers to buy houses earlier. In order to 
give expression to policy continuity, the term "standard price" 
in the original housing reform policy should be kept but the 
content of this term should be adjusted. The new standard price 
should be composed of the burden price [fu dan jia 6298 2137 
0116] and the transaction price [di jiao jia 2107 0074 0116]. 
The burden price is determined by the average annual wage 
income of a working couple in a city or an area and the 
transaction price is determined by the amount of housing funds 
and subsidies in the institution. The standard price should be 
gradually replaced with a slightly profitable price and there 
are two adjustment mechanisms: First, with the increases in 
workers' wage income, the burden price determined by the average 
annual wage income of a working couple should be raised 
accordingly; and second, the ratio of the burden price of a new 
house to the average annual wage income of a working couple 
should also be gradually enlarged. It is necessary to unify the 
rules and policies for the discounts in house sales. This 
should include the discount determined by the purchaser's 
working seniority and the discount for lump-sum payment. The 
working- seniority-determined discount should be based on the 
number of years in which the house-purchasing worker did not 
enjoy the housing fund in the past and this is, in fact, a 
compensation for the short payment of monetary wages for housing 
in the past. The discount for lump-sum payment is a 
compensation for the interest losses of the house purchaser and 
this may encourage workers to effect lump-sum payment when 
buying houses. 
  4. Properly carrying out backup reforms. It is 
now necessary to coordinate the formulation and simultaneous 
adoption of the systems for selling public housing, raising 
rents, and setting up housing funds across the board, as well as 
the systems for arranging individual mortgages and installment 
payments. The policies for developing and regularizing the 
markets for housing transactions and for housing maintenance and 
management, as well as the relevant tax policies, should also be 
properly formulated and implemented at the same time. None of 
these things is dispensable. Only thus can urban residents have 
the motivation and the financial capacity for buying houses and 
only thus can their misgivings be removed in the course of 
purchasing houses. 
  The rental reform is always an important part of the reform 
of the housing system. The goal is to raise rents to the level 
equivalent to the sum of the maintenance charges, the management 
charges, and the depreciation charges by the end of the Eighth 
Five- Year Plan and further raise rents to the level equivalent 
to the sum of the five factors, namely, the maintenance charges, 
the management charges, the depreciation charges, the investment 
returns, and the property taxes. In cities and areas where it 
is indeed difficult to achieve this target, the proportion of 
rental expenditure in the overall household expenditure should 
still be raised to a certain level. A reasonable ratio between 
the prices and the rents should be fixed in the rental reform. 
In international practice, the reasonable ratio is about 1:90. 
That is, the sale price of each square meter of floor space 
should be 90 times the monthly rent of the same floor space. At 
present, it is difficult to reach this ratio on the whole. 
However, rationalizing the ratio between the sale price and the 
rent should be a goal for transforming the housing mechanism. 
While formulating their annual housing reform schemes, various 
localities should give consideration to this point and strive to 
gradually achieve the goal. The localities with more favorable 
conditions should achieve this goal as soon as possible. Various 
localities should announce their rental reform programs before 
the year 2000. The number and margin of rental increases should 
be linked to the transition from the standard price to the 
slightly profitable price. In cities and areas with favorable 
conditions, the sum of the rents paid by workers themselves, the 
housing subsidies to workers, and the part of rents covered by 
the housing funds should gradually become closer to, or equal 
to, the rental level determined by the reasonable ratio between 
the sale price and the rent. 
  The housing fund system is favorable to the accumulation, 
turnover, and circulation of the funds for housing construction. 
It is also favorable to the transformation of the enterprise 
operation mechanism. The distribution of housing as a welfare 
benefit in kind can thus be changed into the distribution of 
monetary wages. All administrative institutions and enterprises 
should make regular contributions to the housing funds and 
establish the housing fund system according to the principle of 
"individual savings, institutional subsidies, unified 
management, and use for the purpose earmarked." 
  At present, workers who have bought or will buy houses, 
generally have certain misgivings in their minds. They fear 
that after buying houses, nobody will take care of house 
maintenance. To solve this problem, we must reform the current 
urban housing management system and develop enterprises which 
offer housing maintenance and management services under various 
systems of ownership. Fair competition on an equal footing 
should be encouraged among them and more conveniences should be 
given to the residents. Various localities should actively 
explore ways to establish the market for housing maintenance and 
management and the market for housing transactions. The 
relevant policies and regulations should be improved as soon as 
possible and the housing market brought into the legal system. 
  5. The reform of the housing system should be closely 
linked with housing development. The purpose of the 
housing reform is to provide a good mechanism for housing 
development. It is necessary to build up regular fundraising 
channels for housing construction, expand the financial sources 
for housing construction, increase the accumulation of housing 
funds, and to gradually bring about a favorable cycle for the 
input and output of housing funds. It is necessary to attach 
importance to the construction of affordable and functional 
housing and strive to lower the costs of house construction so 
that the housing needs of workers with ordinary incomes can be 
met more quickly. Favorable policies in the fields of arranging 
construction land, resettlement, planning, project arrangements, 
and taxation should be given to the institutions which construct 
affordable and functional houses for ordinary workers. The 
banking institutions should also give them financial support. 
The funds raised and concentrated in the course of the housing 
reform should mainly be used to build affordable and functional 
houses and the real estate development companies should be 
responsible for building 20 percent of these. It is necessary 
to continue to develop the system of cooperative housing 
construction through pooling funds in order to provide houses 
for people still living in difficult or even dangerous 
conditions more quickly. 
<H3>  IV. Issues That Should Be Noticed At Present in the Course 
of Quickening Housing Reform </H3>
  To quicken the housing reform, it is necessary to exercise 
more effective leadership over the work of housing reform, to 
intensify propaganda related to the reform of the housing 
system, to persistently carry out the principle of making 
separate decisions according to the local conditions under the 
guidance of the unified policies, and to properly arrange 
reductions and exemptions for retired workers and workers with 
low income. At present, it is particularly necessary to pay 
attention to the following two issues: 
  First, the sales of houses at low prices must be 
resolutely checked. Selling public housing is a major 
measure in quickening housing reform. However, at present, some 
local administrative organs, institutions, and enterprises are 
selling public housing at too low prices in violation of the 
State Council's relevant policies. Therefore, the State Council 
General Office issued the "Circular on Checking Sales of Public 
Housing At Low Prices." The circulart demanded that all 
localities and departments suspend the sale of all public 
housing before the promulgation and enforcement of the State 
Council's "Decision on Quickening Reform of Urban Public 
Housing"; screen all public housing which has been sold; and 
effectively and strictly manage the funds from the sale of 
public housing. Selling public housing at low prices is a 
short-term action which only serves the immediate interests and 
does not consider the long-term development. This is 
unfavorable to the efforts to provide houses for people who are 
still living in difficult and uneasy conditions and may give 
rise to new unfairness in social distribution. This is also 
unfavorable to the healthy development of housing reform and 
must be resolutely checked. After the promulgation of the State 
Council's "Decision on Quickening Reform of Urban Public 
Housing," all localities must strictly carry out the State 
Council's unified policies, substantially raise rents, and 
arrange the sale of public housing in a well planned and orderly 
manner on the basis of setting up the housing funds. They 
should also conscientiously carry out reforms in other fields, 
overcome short-sighted behavior and the welfare viewpoint in the 
course of the housing reform, and prevent themselves from making 
unrealistic comparisons and handling the housing reform as a 
welfare measure. The actions of selling houses at low prices in 
a short time, selling houses in violation of the relevant 
policies by increasing favorable terms in a disguised form, and 
using official powers and functions to seek private gains must 
be resolutely checked. 
  Second, the reform of the urban housing system should 
be focused on housing reform in the enterprises. All 
localities should select a number of large and medium 
state-owned enterprises with favorable conditions to take the 
lead to increase the intensity of housing reform and raise the 
rents substantially, thus promoting the sale of houses. This 
should be linked with the transformation of the enterprises 
operation mechanism and the three reforms in the enterprises. 
Houses should no longer be managed by the enterprises but by 
specialized institutions in society. A number of enterprises 
may jointly set up property management companies under the 
joint- stock system, or in other forms, to quicken the process 
of separating the functions of constructing, distributing, 
managing, and maintaining houses from the enterprises. 
  The reform of the urban housing system is an important issue 
which concerns all households and the masses are most interested 
in it. Therefore, it must be successful and must not fail. It 
is hoped that people in all social circles will understand, 
participate in, and support the housing reform and will make 
joint efforts to successfully fulfill this important and arduous 
reform task.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 </F>
0524): "Housing Reform Will Take a Firm Step Forward This Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Housing reform, which has 
been moving forward along with the deepening of other reform 
programs, will achieve a more substantial headway this year. 
  Ever since Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the general 
plan 
for housing reform in the early 1980's -- a plan basing on 
selling public housing, readjusting rents, and encouraging 
people to buy and build houses -- China's urban housing reform 
has been moving forward in an exploratory manner. Since the 
beginning of the 1990's, the nation has made substantial 
progress in housing reform. Although the time for establishing 
a new housing system is ripe, as the people's psychological and 
economic capacity for housing reform has become noticeably 
stronger, housing reform, like all other reforms, has not been 
smooth sailing. 
  According to an analysis made by an authority of the State 
Council Leading Group for Housing Reform, the main problems 
which housing reform has faced over the past two years have been 
difficulties in raising rents and selling housing, and these 
problems have stalled housing reform. First of all, according 
to the original goal set for housing reform, rents collected at 
the end of the eighth five-year plan period should be enough to 
cover housing maintenance, management, and depreciation. 
However, in areas in which housing reform has been launched, 
the average amount of rent collected for each square meter of 
floor space has been only 0.3 yuan, far below the 0.75 yuan 
required to cover maintenance alone. The main reason why rents 
could not be raised was that government, enterprises, and 
workers were unable to cope with the increase either 
economically or psychologically. According to estimates, the 
nation has now 2.7 billion square meters of public housing, if 
the rents for this housing are raised to the target set for the 
end of the eighth five-year plan period, enormous subsidies will 
be needed. This was why the second-step rent increase, which is 
part of the housing reform program in some cities and regions, 
became "stranded." Secondly, because there was neither any 
applicable mechanism nor supporting policy for housing sales, 
sizable housing reform was exceedingly difficult. 
  What should be done to tackle these problems? As we cannot 
stop or scrap the housing reform project, we must increase the 
intensity of reform. Only by so doing can we break the deadlock 
and create a new situation. Housing reform is a link in the 
chain of reform. If housing reform fails to move forward in 
various sectors with great intensity, the failure will seriously 
obstruct China's reform process. Two sets of figures show the 
urgent need in China for housing reform: 1) So that rent 
collected in 1987 could foot the bill for maintenance, 
management, depreciation, interest on investment, and property 
tax, subsidies amounting to only 27 billion yuan were paid by 
various authorities, this became 41.6 billion yuan by 1990, and 
jumped sharply to 67 billion in 1992, increasing by 8 billion 
yuan annually on the average. 2) The nation now has 27 billion 
square meters of public housing. Based on the need to spend 350 
yuan to build of one square meter of housing, annual 
depreciation of 2 percent amounts to 18.9 billion yuan. For the 
maintenance and management of this housing, the state and 
enterprises have to spend 7 to 8 billion yuan each year. This 
is to say that the state and enterprises will lose between 25.9 
and 26.9 billion yuan per year. This shows that if housing 
reform stops, public housing will become a heavy "burden" on the 
state and enterprises, and not an asset. If housing reform is 
delayed, the direct consequence will be increasingly higher 
housing subsidies to be paid by the state and enterprises, as 
well as an increasingly higher cost of reform. We should also 
be aware that if we fail to speed up housing reform and 
establish a new housing system, we can hardly speed up housing 
construction or improve housing conditions for urban residents. 
While this will seriously affect our efforts to achieve the 
goal that all city dwellers have comparatively comfortable 
living quarters by the year 2000, it will also prevent 
enterprises from replacing their operating mechanisms and 
obstruct the work of building a socialist market economic system. 
  As we are confronted with a formidable task in achieving 
noticeable results in improving housing conditions for Chinese 
city dwellers by the end of this century, and meeting the demand 
to build a socialist market economic system, we must take more 
powerful and practical measures to break the deadlock of housing 
reform and blaze a new path with Chinese characteristics. To 
this end, state authorities have come up with a new idea for 
housing reform: While the emphasis will be on selling public 
housing, efforts will also be made to rent out public housing 
units and build new housing units, and to reform the rent 
system, encourage all units to establish public funds for 
housing construction, speed up construction of economic and 
affordable housing units, and draw up supporting policies for 
the development of the housing market so that more commodity 
housing units can be built by the public. 
  The essence of the new idea is to replace the old system, 
under which the investment needed for housing construction had 
to be found by the state and enterprises, with a new system 
under which investment needed for housing construction is 
rationally shared by the state, units concerned, and 
individuals. Moreover, if we put the emphasis on selling public 
housing units, the move will activate the housing inventory, 
speed up the recovery of capital, speed up housing construction, 
and turn public housing from being a "burden" into real cash. 
Estimates show that if only 10 percent of public housing units 
are sold, nearly 100 billion yuan will be recovered. Naturally, 
housing units can only be sold when the state has drawn up the 
necessary supporting policies and measures so that buyers can 
afford short-term, medium-term, or long-term payments; 
otherwise, the expression selling housing units becomes an empty 
phrase. 
  After many years of exploratory reform, fundamental changes 
have started to take place in China's decades-old public housing 
system. This year, as China embarks on "expediting reform as a 
whole and making breakthroughs in key points," big and firm 
strides will certainly be made in housing reform.

  [Text] Kunming, January 18 (XINHUA) -- A Sino-Lao-Myanmar 
[Burmese]-Thai technical meeting on opening to navigation a 
river running through the four countries started here today. 
  The river originates from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Its 
upper reaches are within China where it is called the Lancang 
River, while its lower reaches are called Mekong River, running 
through Laos, Myanmar (the former Burma) and Thailand. 
  Ding Weimin, an official of the Department of Communications 
of Yunnan Provincial Government said at today's opening of the 
meeting that expert groups of the four countries all made 
proposals to their own governments after they made a joint 
survey tour of the river last year, February to May, urging that 
an agreement on opening the river to navigation should be signed 
as soon as possible. 
  During the four-day meeting, representatives from the four 
countries will thoroughly discuss a draft of the agreement. 
  After the meeting, the participants will go to make a 
further 
survey of a section of the river. 
  A source from the meeting said that the results of the 
Sino-Lao- Myanmar-Thai joint survey last year showed that a 
60-ton vessel can negotiate the river all year round and a 
150-ton one can use the river for eight months a year. If the 
river is dredged, 300-ton vessels would be able to use the river 
all the year round.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, January 17 (XINHUA) -- A government 
delegation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China arrived 
here today for a seven-day good-will visit to Malaysia. 
  The eight-member delegation led by Tomur Dawamat, vice 
chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's 
Congress was met at the airport by Daud Taha, deputy minister of 
housing and local government of Malaysia. 
  Dawamat told reporters that his visit is to strengthen 
friendship and understanding between China, including Xinjiang 
and Malaysia and to promote economic ties. 
  He said his visit is at the invitation of Prime Minister 
Mohamed Mahathir who showed a strong interest in Xinjiang during 
his official visit to China in June last year. 
  Dawamat is scheduled to call on the prime minister and the 
supreme head of state Sultan Shah Azlan who also visited 
Xinjiang in 1991. 
  The delegation will later tour the economic planning unit in 
the prime minister's department and industrial enterprises.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mohamed Mahathir met with Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman 
of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's 
Congress, here today, having a one-hour conversation. 
  Dawamat said his visit is intended to enhance relations 
between China and Malaysia and to promote economic ties between 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China and Malaysia. 
  Xinjiang welcomes Malaysians to go there as tourists or 
doing 
business, he said, as the region is rich in natural resources 
and has many Muslims, like Malaysia. 
  Mahathir said friendly relations between Malaysia and China 
have been developing fast. Since his visit to China, there have 
been more personnel exchanges. He hoped that more people from 
Xinjiang will come to Malaysia. One potential area for business 
cooperation may be petroleum, he suggested. 
  Dawamat is heading a Xinjiang delegation on a one-week visit 
to Malaysia. They arrived yesterday.

  [Text] Hanoi, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The Vietnamese 
Communist Party opened its national conference here this 
morning, according to the newspaper TIN TUC BUOI CHIEU. 
  General Secretary Do Muoi gave a report to sum up the work 
over the past two and a half years and set down the tasks for 
the next two and a half years. 
  The report said the achievements have been made mainly in 
three areas, including a very important initial step in 
overcoming the socio-economic crisis, continued political 
stability and expanded foreign ties with other countries. 
  Vietnam began a reform program in 1989, switching from a 
planned economy to a socialist market system. 
  Do Muoi noted that although numerous weakness remained, the 
achievements have created pre-conditions for the 
industrialization and modernization of the country's economy. 
  The report ascribed the achievements to the leadership of 
the 
Communist Party, rejecting the multi-party political system. 
  It also stressed that economic development must be linked 
with social justice, reflecting the reasonable distribution of 
goods and the means of production and fully developing the 
capability of every citizen. 
  The conference is mid-way between the Seventh National 
Conference of the Vietnamese Communist Party held in 1991 and 
the Eighth National Conference in two and a half years time.

  [Text] China's trade conducted across its southwestern 
border will go a long way towards normalising trade ties with 
Vietnam and Laos, according to a Chinese official. Border trade 
with Vietnam and Laos was suspended for some time last year due 
to relations between the countries. "Since trade ties between 
them resumed, the countries' governments -- both at central and 
local levels -- are meeting more frequently on border trade 
policy," said Fan Xiliang, chief of the comprehensive division 
of Yunnan Provincial Economic Relations and Trade for 
Neighbouring Countries Administrative Bureau. "Therefore, the 
outlook for border trade is good," he added. 
  China's southwestern Yunnan province has a 4,000-kilometre 
boundary with Burma, Laos and Vietnam. It takes care of the 
mainland's border trade with those countries. "Trade with all 
three countries is rising. But as our trade with Burma already 
has a higher volume, Vietnam and Laos are likely to grow faster 
in the future," Mr Fan said. More than 80 per cent of Yunnan's 
border trade was with Burma, he said, with Vietnam accounting 
for about 10 per cent and Laos the rest. "China has had good 
links with Burma for ages. The traffic and communication 
systems between the two countries are better developed. That's 
why their border trade volume is so high," he said. 
  Yunnan's border trade stood at 2.27 billion yuan (about HK$2 
billion) in 1992, up 38.4 per cent on the 1.64 million yuan in 
1991. Imports and exports were balanced. Border trade is 
conducted in yuan, as opposed to foreign trade where 
transactions are made in foreign currencies. 
  The mainland has been conducting border trade with the three 
countries since before the establishment of the People's 
Republic. "Since the country adopted its open economy policy, 
great attention has been paid to border trade, which is 
supported and agreed on by the Government," Mr Fan said. 
  Lower tariffs are charged on imports through border trade 
from the three countries, while some cities on the Chinese 
border enjoy some of the benefits granted to coastal cities. 
"We help encourage people to trade higher-end goods. We are 
also working to crack down on both the import and export of 
imitation products," Mr Fan said. Participants in border trade 
are state, collective and private enterprises, including 
hawkers. Approvals from the relevant authorities are needed for 
conducting border trade.

  [Text] New Delhi, January 14 (XINHUA) -- India's chief of 
the Army Staff General B.C. Joshi said there were positive gains 
for both India and China in implementing the historic border 
agreement. 
  In an interview to inter-services newsletter "SAINIK 
SAMACHAR" on the eve of the Army Day here today, General Joshi 
said that though the Sino-Indian border agreement, signed last 
September when Indian Prime Minister Rao visited Beijing, was 
not fully implemented yet, the course that had been set was a 
positive one. 
  Progress achieved in this path would indicate the thrusts 
and 
changes in the mission of the Indian Army, Joshi said. 
  The two dimensions for the Indian Army to defeat external 
and 
internal threats had tended to merge and peace with "our 
neighbors" was a vital aspect in this battle. 
  In an apparent reference to large number of force levels 
which would become available once the reduction in troop and 
weaponry level went underway as stipulated in the agreement, the 
general said the progress of implementation of the agreement 
would indicate how best Army could use this manpower.

  [Text] Tehran, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Iran today ruled out 
the possibility reported by the Western press that the United 
States will carry out military strike against the country before 
1996. 
  Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received], deputy foreign minister 
for 
Euro-American affairs, said in an exclusive interview with 
XINHUA, "We believe that this action will not happen because the 
United States knows us better than other countries." 
  He said that Iran is not a small country like Libya, but it 
is a big nation with an internal unity and abundant resources. 
  He noted that the so-called U.S. war against Iran is merely 
a 
psychological war by writers in Western countries. "You can't 
hear this from any officials." 
  However, since the beginning of last year, the Western media 
have occasionally reported that the United States and Israel 
would launch a war against Iran before 1996 and they would 
strike Iran's nuclear facilities and military bases. 
  According to reports, there are certain Pentagon plans to 
start a war against Islamic Iran. Some Pentagon analysts 
believe that a military confrontation between Iran and the 
United States will be inevitable at some stage. 
  When asked about the Iranian Government's response to the 
possible U.S. military strike on Iran, the deputy foreign 
minister said, "Our government, our Army and our people are 
ready for any kind of actions." 
  Relations between Iran and the United States have been 
strained for 14 years since 1979 when the U.S. Embassy in Tehran 
was seized by Moslems students. 
  Vaezi noted that the United States has kept a hostile 
attitude toward Iran. "We should not have normal relations with 
them unless they change their attitude and give us money back." 
  "This is a prerequisite for normalization of relations 
between Iran and the United States," he added. 
  Meanwhile, Iranian leader Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i late last 
year explicitly ruled out the possibility of negotiations 
between Iran and the United States and renewed his support for 
the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy. 
  Khamene'i also described those Iranians who advocate talks 
with Washington as "naive, coward and ignorant," saying they are 
unfamiliar with political issues and unaware of the dangers such 
negotiations will entail. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in Brussels 
last month that Washington still considered Iran an "outlaw 
nation" involved in terrorism. 
  "And we think that strong action should be taken to deny 
them 
dual-use technology as well as other steps," he added.

  [Text] Tehran, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Iran will have more 
foreign debts this year but it will honor the commitments to 
repayment of its foreign debts, according to a senior Iranian 
official. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today, Iranian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received] said 
that his country's foreign debts will reach 15 billion U.S. 
dollars by the end of this year provided the government will not 
make any repayment. 
  Earlier reports said that the country so far has delayed the 
payment of some 8-9 billion dollars and an additional sum of 6 
billion dollars will mature this year. 
  Vaezi put Iran's foreign debts at about 8.8 billion dollars, 
saying that Germany is Iran's biggest creditor with some 2 
billion dollars, followed by Japan, with 1.5 billion dollars, 
and France, with 250 million dollars. 
  Iranian officials are discussing with foreign countries to 
find a way out for the foreign debts, he said, believing that 
the issue will be solved in the near future. 
  Iran failed to repay its foreign debts last year due to the 
sharp drop in oil prices in the world market following the 
depression of the world economy. 
  However, Governor of Iran's Central Bank Mohammad 'Adeli 
said 
earlier this month that the Central Bank and the government do 
not owe a single penny to any country or company, but the 
Iranian private sectors and commercial banks have foreign debts. 
  He said that his country has only to repay 8 billion dollars 
and the delay of repayment is due to the non-cooperative 
attitude of insurance agencies to cover medium and long-term 
credits. 
  The Iranian Government decided in the budget of 1994 to 
repay 
some 1 billion dollars of foreign debts, but many Iranian 
officials urged the government to allocate more incomes to repay 
foreign debts. 
  Some experts believed that the Iranian Majlis (parliament) 
will raise the figure for government to repay foreign debts as 
the government will reduce its development expenditures because 
of the low oil prices. 
  The government hoped in the new year's budget to get 12.5 
billion dollars with the oil price calculated at 14 dollars per 
barrel, but many officials especially the Majlis deputies 
believed that the country's oil income will not exceed 10 
billion dollars since the present oil price stands below 13 
dollars.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Fu Li </F>
(0265 4539) and XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an all-Army 
literary and art work conference today, Yu Yongbo, member of the 
Central Military Commission [CMC] and director of the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] General Political Department, said 
emphatically: To promote a boom in literary and artistic 
undertakings and to develop such undertakings in the Army under 
the new situation, we must conscientiously carry out Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art under the guidance of 
the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The all-Army literary and art work conference opened in 
Beijing on 10 January. The main items on the conference's 
agenda called for seriously studying and solving new 
circumstances and problems in the Army's literary and art work 
under the conditions of accelerating reform and opening up and 
of establishing a socialist market economic structure, in 
accordance with the set of important directives recently issued 
by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin on the Army's literary and art work, 
and under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics; gaining a clearer 
understanding of the situation; setting clear missions; working 
hard in unity; blazing new trails and putting forward new ideas; 
and promoting the development and flourishing of the Army's 
literature and art. 
  In his speech, Yu Yongbo said: As with other work, the 
Army's literary and art work has yielded substantial 
achievements. The new situation and new tasks, however, have 
created new and even stricter demands on the Army's literary and 
art work. In carrying out literary and art work, the Army 
should follow the correct orientation, accommodate the evolving 
situation, constantly blaze new trails and put forward new 
ideas, render better services for the people and socialism, and 
serve the need of improving the combat effectiveness of military 
troops. 
  Yu Yongbo said: Comrade Xiaoping's thinking on literature 
and art is an important component of the great treasure house of 
his theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
By inheriting Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, he 
set forth many new ideas and theoretical viewpoints on socialist 
literature and art in accordance with the new historic 
conditions and the party's central task. In implementing CMC 
Chairman Jiang Zemin's recent set of directives on the Army's 
literary and art work, the most fundamental task is to promote 
the flourishing and development of the Army's literary and art 
undertakings and to permit large quantities of positive, 
wholesome, and popular outstanding literary and art works to 
occupy the Army's ideological and cultural front in accordance 
with Comrade Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art. To 
promote a literary and artistic boom in the Army, we should 
vigorously publicize the main theme of the times. In 
publicizing the main theme, our Army should set higher standards 
and do a better job so that the theme will become more distinct 
and resounding in our literary and artistic creations, in our 
performances, and even in the entire cultural life of military 
camps. In literature and art, the Army should uphold the spirit 
of the times and give priority to social benefits. 
  Yu Yongbo said: To create a literary and artistic boom in 
the Army, we must strive to promote a boom in creations and 
performances with military themes. Our writers and artists 
should work hard to exploit and record our military themes, be 
they historical or current. To promote a boom in literary and 
art works with military themes, we still need to further 
emancipate our minds, put forward new ideas while carrying on 
our tradition, seek development while drawing upon others' 
experiences, and move forward steadily along the road toward 
incorporating national features in our works. Each year, the 
entire Army should focus on producing a number of high-quality 
works and strive to produce nationally influential and good 
novels, movies, television dramas, plays, and songs and dances. 
  Speaking on Army building, Yu Yongbo said: To create a 
literary and artistic boom in the Army, we should rely on the 
hard work of the vast numbers of literary and art workers and on 
improving the general quality of the literary and art ranks. 
Our literary and art workers should foster a lofty sense of 
responsibility toward society, promote the spirit of dedication, 
unflaggingly engage in artistic pursuits, and persistently go 
into the thick of life. Leaders at all levels should strengthen 
and improve leadership over literary and art work, unify the 
thinking of writers and artists, further cement the literary and 
art ranks, and inspire everyone's enthusiasm. 
  Yu Yongbo also expressed his hope concerning strengthening 
cultural construction in the Army, enriching the cultural life 
of military camps, maintaining the high standard and style of 
cultural life in military camps, and carrying out mass and 
regular recreational activities. 
  More than 160 people attended the conference. They included 
Zhou Ziyu, Du Tiehuan, and Xu Caihou, deputy directors of the 
PLA General Political Department; Tang Tianbiao, assistant 
director of the PLA General Political Department; leaders from 
the political and cultural departments of various units and from 
professional theatrical troupes in the entire Army; veteran 
writers and artists; and young and middle-aged backbone cadres.

XINHUA reporters Xu Dianlong (1776 3013 7893) and Huang Qiusheng 
(7806 4428 3932)] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 22 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Nanjing Military 
Region convened a rally in Hangzhou today to commemorate the 
30th anniversary of the naming of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" 
by the Defense Ministry. Yu Yongbo, member of the Central 
Military Commission [CMC] and director of the General Political 
Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], spoke at the 
rally on behalf of the CMC and the three general departments. 
  Inscriptions by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and Vice Chairmen 
Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen were read at the rally. The three 
leaders' inscriptions are, respectively: "Carry forward the 
hard-boned spirit and promote Army building in an all-round 
way," "Pass on the hard- boned spirit from generation to 
generation," and "Carry forward the tradition of Red Army 
veterans and promote the hard-boned spirit." 
  The "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" is famous throughout the 
services for its steadfast combat readiness, strong militancy, 
toughened military skills, and strict military and 
administrative discipline. On 22 January 1964, the Defense 
Ministry designated it with the honorable title of the 
"Hard-Boned Sixth Company." In 1985, it was again named by the 
CMC the "Heroic Hard-Boned Sixth Company." The company has been 
cited for collective meritorious service, first class, on three 
occasions; collective meritorious service, second class, on 11 
occasions; and collective meritorious service, third class, on 
eight occasions. The company's party branch three times has 
been named an advanced grass-roots party organization in the 
nation and throughout the services. 
  Yu Yongbo congratulated the company on behalf of the CMC and 
the three general departments. He said: The growth and 
progress of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" reflect the 
painstaking care of three generations of our party's leadership 
collectives. Chairman Mao received the delegations of the Sixth 
Company on six occasions. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has a high 
opinion of the company and pointed out: "As far as companies 
are concerned, they are doing the right thing in emulating the 
Hard-Boned Sixth Company because the company's work style should 
not be the work style of one company alone. All companies, and 
even cadres at all levels, should study hard and train hard like 
the Sixth Company and should have the political awareness of the 
company." Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected the company in person 
and called on us to "carry forward the hard- boned spirit and 
promote Army building in an all-round way." He also pointed 
out: The "hard-boned" spirit is the precious spiritual wealth 
of the PLA. This spirit, in a nutshell, means never bowing 
before any adversity but rather daring to fight, to sacrifice, 
and to win. This kind of hard-boned spirit is important in 
times of war; it is also important in times of peace. Comrade 
Jiang Zemin's comments, which sum up the Sixth Company's basic 
spirit and bring to light the profound substance of the 
"hard-boned" spirit, serve to point out a direction for the 
emulation of the Sixth Company in the new situation. 
  Yu Yongbo said: Under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th 
CPC National Congress, the whole party and the whole nation are 
marching with big strides along the path of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
As the solid pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship, 
our Army is entrusted with the sacred mission of safeguarding 
national security and providing a peaceful environment for 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. We must arouse 
our morale and fighting will with the "hard-boned" spirit; be 
loyal to the party, the people, the motherland, and socialism at 
all times; place the interests of the party, state, and people 
above everything else; and make new and greater contributions to 
the party and people. He urged leading cadres at all levels in 
the military to take the lead and set a good example in 
emulating and promoting the "hard-boned" spirit, arm the cadres 
and fighters with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and further enhance 
their awareness and steadfastness in implementing the party's 
basic line. It it necessary to guide the cadres and fighters to 
conscientiously study modern military skills, train hard, 
constantly enhance their awareness, foster a correct outlook on 
life and values, and arm the whole Army with this 
all-conquering, hard-boned spirit. We should, pursuant to the 
requirements in the reissued "Program for the Construction of 
Grass-Roots Army Units," develop in large numbers all-round 
competent companies which are "qualified politically and 
competent militarily, which have a fine work style, which 
maintain strict discipline, and which are assured of adequate 
logistical support." 
  On behalf of the three general departments, Zhou Ziyu, 
deputy 
director of the General Political Department, presented the 
company with a horizontal board with the words "Forever preserve 
and carry forward the hard-boned spirit" inscribed in gold. 
Also present were leaders of the Nanjing Military Region and 
Zhejiang Province including Gu Hui, Fang Zuqi, Li Zemin, and Wan 
Xueyuan, and officers and men of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company."

<F P=106> [By Reporter Wang Rantong (3769 3544 1749) and Special </F>
Correspondent Bao Guojun (0545 0948 0193): "The Autonomous 
Regional Party Committee Holds Ceremonious Meeting To Discuss 
Military Affairs"] 
  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 29 December, the autonomous 
regional party committee held a ceremonious meeting to discuss 
military affairs. Attending the meeting were leaders of the 
regional party, government, and military organizations, 
including Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, 
Geriletu, Yang Enbo, Wuyunqimuge, Diao Congzhou, and Zhou Weide. 
  Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee and 
first 
political commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military District, 
presided over the meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee 
and 
chairman of the region, made a speech at the meeting. He 
stressed: To successfully make the party manage the armed forces 
work, we should foster the overall concept of not forgetting 
national defense while grasping the economy. We should also 
realistically help military units solve practical problems, give 
full play to the role of militia and reserve service forces, and 
actually build the people's armed forces departments into a 
strong first-line headquarters. 
  Comrade Wang Qun also made an important speech at the 
meeting. He first stressed the necessity of fully understanding 
the extremely great significance of making the party manage 
armed forces work under the new situation. Comrade Wang Qun 
demanded: In doing the armed forces work, we should 
conscientiously implement the guiding principle of "taking a 
two-handed approach and being tough with both hands." We should 
not only unfailingly grasp economic construction but also not 
forget to grasp national defense well. We should not only pay 
attention to implementing the tasks on armed forces work, but 
also give full play to the role of militia and reserve service 
in building the "two civilizations" in order to make the 
region's national defense reserve forces more submit to the 
overall situation and more suitable for national defense. 
Comrade Wang Qun pointed out the necessity of studying and 
solving the new circumstances and new problems facing the armed 
forces work. First, we should tackle the problem that the 
people's sense of national defense in peace time has been waned; 
second, we should correctly and appropriately handle the 
relations between inheritance and creation; and third, we should 
strengthen the idea of running armed forces departments 
according to laws. Comrade Wang Qun stressed at conclusion that 
we should truly attend to the implementation of various items of 
armed forces work. First, we should further straighten out the 
guiding ideology for the work and foster the good practice of 
seeking truth and doing concrete work. Second, we should 
overcome the idea of inertia, truly attend to work, and give 
full play to the functions and role of military organs. 
  Attending the meeting were Bayaertu and Feng Yuqiang, deputy 
commanders of the Inner Mongolia Military District; and 
Zhaorigetu and Guan Shuren, deputy political commissars of the 
district. Also attending were responsible comrades of party and 
government organizations of various leagues, cities, banners, 
and counties, and responsible comrades of pertinent departments 
of the region.

  [Text] The provincial party committee held a military work 
meeting yesterday afternoon. 
  Wang Maolin, provincial party committee secretary and 
provincial military district party committee first secretary, 
delivered a speech at the meeting in which he emphatically 
stated that the principle of the party running the Armed Forces 
is essential and fundamental to consolidating and developing the 
People's Armed Forces. Therefore, we should make redoubled 
efforts to strengthen rather than weaken the party leadership 
over the Armed Forces under the new situation of reform and 
opening up. 
  Comrade Wang Maolin said: Since the party should run the 
Armed Forces, we should make every possible endeavor to 
successfully manage the Armed Forces, this being at once a 
traditional CPC system and an important duty of local leaders. 
To this end, it is imperative to enhance a sense of the 
people's militia. I hope that party committees and governments 
at all levels in Hunan will strive to successfully manage the 
Armed Forces and contribute more to province-wide reform, 
opening up, economic construction, and national defense reserve 
forces building. 
  Chen Bangzhu, provincial governor and chairman of the 
provincial armed forces work committee, also delivered a speech 
at the meeting in which he called on party committees and 
governments at all levels in Hunan to fully understand the 
importance of stepping up people's militia and reserve forces 
building under the new situation of building a socialist market 
economic structure; attach great importance to and tackle 
practical problems hindering people's militia and reserve forces 
building; strengthen unity between the Armed Forces and the 
people, between the police forces and the people, as well as 
between the Armed Forces and the police forces; and carry out 
Armed Forces work under CPC leadership in a responsible manner. 
  Major General Pang Weiqiang, provincial party committee 
standing committee member and provincial military district 
commander, delivered a work report at the meeting presided over 
by Major General Deng Hanmin, provincial military district 
political commissar. 
  The meeting was attended by a number of provincial party, 
government and military leaders, including Yang Zhengwu; Liu 
Fusheng [provincial people's congress standing committee 
chairman]; Chu Bo; Hu Biao; Wang Keying; Zhu Miaoquan; Xiao 
Qiuru; He Yaodong; Wang Zhushi; Liu Shiying; and Ma Chongbiao; 
all prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party 
committee secretaries; all military subarea party committee 
first secretaries, and all city mayors, autonomous prefectural 
administrators, and prefectural commissioners who are 
concurrently city, autonomous prefectural, and prefectural Armed 
Forces work committees chairmen.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 19 (AFP)--China will be able to 
manufacture its own combat aircraft and "advanced helicopters" 
by 2000, the president of the Chinese aerospace industry, Zhu 
Yuli, said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  Zhu provided no details about the aircraft, which he said 
were part of an ambitious "takeoff plan" by his industry in the 
coming 10-to-15 years. Western military experts said Zhu may 
have been referring to the Super-7 fighter, which has been on 
the Chinese drawing board for years. It is an updated version 
of the J-7, which itself is a derivation of the Soviet-designed 
MiG-21, they said. The MiG-21 is considered a relatively 
mediocre craft, mainly because of the forward location of the 
air intake, which limits the size of the radar. Russia is 
already a known partner in developing an engine for the Super-7, 
although it is not known whether it will take part in devising a 
new radar for it. 
  China has been showing off a model of the prototype at air 
shows abroad, in a bid to woo a foreign partner. The U.S. firm 
Grumman Corp. put forward a proposal, but scrapped it after the 
Chinese military helped quell pro-democracy protests in Beijing 
in 1989. "Whatever kind of combat plane they have in mind, the 
Chinese have to find a partner, because they don't have the 
technical ability to manufacture a plane of this kind by 
themselves," an expert said. 
  China has also been urging Russia to sell it a production 
line for the high-performance and highly rated MiG-31. 
  Zhu also announced that China "will gradually construct a 
complete research and production system for advanced 
helicopters." Western experts said this was apparently a 
reference to anti-tank helicopters fitted with night sights for 
operations after dark. "However, the Chinese have much to learn 
before they master this technology," one said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Increasing numbers 
of military airports are being expanded or renovated for civil 
use in China to meet the needs of the national economic advance. 
  In the past ten years a total of 31 military airports have 
been expanded and renovated with funds jointly supplied by local 
governments and the military, and are usually jointly managed. 
  Last year alone 11 military airports completed their 
expansion work. 
  The opening of Gonggar airport, a military airport in Lhasa, 
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, to civilian use has

  [Text] The People's Navy has stressed efforts to improve 
the preparatory capabilities of submarine mines while enhancing 
seaborne technical capabilities in wartime. A number of 
professional and technical experts came to the fore during a 
recent submarine mine skill contest. 
  Our country was the earliest to invent and use submarine 
mines. Submarine mine warfare was recorded as early as in 1549. 
Submarine mines have attracted the attention of other 
countries' navies because they can pose threats over an extended 
period, can launch surprise attacks from hiding, and cannot be 
eliminated easily. [video shows a submarine cruising on the sea

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- The General Staff 
Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] issued 
instructions on training of the armed forces in the new year. 
The instructions require all PLA units to guide themselves with 
Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's concept of 
army building in the new period, to keep to the correct 
orientation of military training, and to further increase the 
intensity and depth of training reform so as to improve the 
fighting capabilities of the armed forces as a whole. 
  The General Staff Department calls on leaders at all levels 
in the armed forces to focus their attention on changes in the 
objective situation, the characteristics of modern warfare, the 
actual conditions of our army building, and the new situations 
and characteristics of army building and combat in the new 
period; to conscientiously implement the series instructions 
issued by Jiang Zemin and other leaders of the Central Military 
Commission; and to give more macro-guidance for training. 
Keeping reality and development in mind, all PLA units, 
academies, and schools should quicken their pace of progress, 
deepen their reforms, and strive to explore new ways of 
training. In connection with cadres' in-service training, they 
should conduct training in high technology, suiting such 
training to different trainees at various levels. All military 
academies and schools should focus their attention on the 
developing students' intelligence and improving their abilities. 
They should do a good job of overall planning for optimizing 
the knowledge and ability of cadres at various levels. 
  The General Staff Department stresses: In training 
management, it is necessary to improve training mechanisms, 
rules, and regulations; to formulate policies and measures to 
link actual training achievements with the immediate interests 
of officers and men; to increase the degree of difficulty and 
intensity in training; to improve the basic quality of all PLA 
units and their fighting capabilities; and to explore ways to 
vanquish the enemy with existing weapons and equipment. Efforts 
should be made to step up the coordinated training of the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force and to keep improving their fighting 
capabilities. It is essential to pay attention to both army 
building and management, to raise the efficiency of training, 
and to strengthen and improve ideological and political work in 
this regard to arouse the enthusiasm of officers and men for 
military training.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- Presently, 
compilation and administration of the Glossary of Military 
Thematic Terms [Junyong Zhuti Cipiao 6511 3938 0031 7344 
6101 5903], a basic project for building automated command in 
the whole army [quanjun zhihui zidonghua jianshe 0356 6511 2172 
2264 5261 0520 0553 1696 6080], has made major breakthroughs and 
achieved remarkable results. Today, the All-Army Committee for 
Compilation and Administration of Military Thematic Terms held 
an exhibition in Beijing on the results of the compilation along 
with a report-back demonstration of their practical application. 
Leaders from the three general departments of the PLA [People's 
Liberation Army] and major units of the whole army attended the 
exhibition and watched the demonstration. 
  The Glossary of Military Thematic Terms is a 
modern linguistic tool for checking and searching information. 
This project was listed in 1987 as a key state project 
concerning standards for military use under the "Seventh 
Five-Year Plan." The quality of the principal part of the 
project has attained advanced international levels and has 
successively won special awards for outstanding achievements in 
military scientific research in the whole army and a First Class 
Prize for scientific and technological advancement in military 
standardization awarded by the Commission of Science, 
Technology, and Industry for National Defense. Its 
complementary project and building of a whole series of relevant 
tools have also made significant progress with the completion of 
a Manual for Using the Glossary of Military Thematic 
Terms and a Dictionary of Military Thematic 
Terms as well as the compilation of a 13-part glossary for 
the principal terms in a specialized subject. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Bangdong (1728 6721 2767) and </F>
reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Chinese People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] has achieved phenomenal success in 
promoting military contacts with foreign countries over the past 
one year. In addition to creating a new situation for exchange 
with foreign countries, it has also contributed positively to 
developing Chinese diplomacy and expediting the modernization of 
the Chinese Armed Forces. 
  In 1993, Chinese Armed Forces received over 1,300 members of 
120 military delegations and groups from more than 40 countries, 
and sent more than 60 delegations and groups to visit 36 
countries. During the same year, naval vessels and over 2,300 
officers and men from Russia and three other countries visited 
China, and the Chinese naval vessel, the "Zheng He," visited 
Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. 
  Chinese Armed Forces continued to maintain relatively 
high-level contacts with armed forces in neighboring countries 
last year. The frequent exchange of visits by ranking officers 
has contributed positively to promoting good neighborliness. 
Chinese Armed Forces increased contacts and broadened exchanges 
with armed forces of certain countries with which contacts had 
been infrequent or disrupted. The establishment of contacts 
with the armed forces of countries with which military contacts 
were reestablished not long ago has enhanced mutual 
understanding and friendship. 
  Chinese Armed Forces' specialized technological exchanges 
with foreign armed forces were even more active. Some PLA 
delegations and groups went abroad on study and inspection 
tours, and for advance studies or technical training; and the 
Chinese PLA also received many foreign delegations and 
specialized technology groups. During the specialized 
technological exchanges, Chinese Armed Forces and their foreign 
counterparts shared with one another their experiences about 
military construction and military science and technology, and 
these exchanges have promoted understanding, developed 
cooperation, and helped each other improve. 
  To display Chinese Armed Forces' successes in 
revolutionization, modernization, and regularization, Chinese 
Armed Forces and colleges opened to foreign visitors have been 
making active efforts to improve their reception for foreign 
visitors and they have acted as showcases exhibiting the bearing 
and high morale of the Chinese Armed Forces.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liang Guihe (2733 6311 0735)] </F>
  [Text] Paris, 22 Jan (XINHUA) -- French President 
Mitterrand met with Qian Qichen, the visiting Chinese vice 
premier and foreign minister, at the Elysee Palace this morning. 
The two had a 30-minute talk in an animated, amiable atmosphere. 
  Mitterrand told Qian Qichen: "It is a great pleasure to meet 
you today. I warmly welcome your official visit to France. We 
hope for further contacts between the two countries." 
  Mitterrand said: "Since the sixties, I have visited China 
many times, and met Mr. Deng Xiaoping on three occasions. He 
left a deep impression on me." He added: "China is a giant. I 
have watched closely its changes and developments. The speed of 
your country's growth is marvelous. The Chinese leaders have 
led their people in achieving political and economic development 
in the past 15 years, and I must pay respects to them." 
  On bilateral relations, Mitterrand said: "Previously, the 
development of relations between the two countries had slowed 
down. I am very glad to see the new development of 
Franco-Chinese relations, which will benefit both sides. Now we 
will further improve and develop bilateral relations from this 
starting point." 
  Qian Qichen said: "China and France are countries with long- 
standing cultures and unique spiritual wealth. In the past 
three decades since the establishment of diplomatic relations, 
bilateral ties have expanded considerably. Despite temporary 
difficulties and twists and turns, the two countries have 
generally maintained and developed effective cooperation. 
Recently, the Chinese and French Governments reached an 
agreement on improving bilateral ties, thus turning a new page 
in Sino-French relations which have normalized and will further 
develop. We are very happy about this." 
  Qian reiterated that the Chinese Government attaches 
importance to developing friendly ties of cooperation with 
France. The Chinese Government seeks to continually develop 
lasting and stable relations with France. This will not only be 
conducive to the two countries, but will also contribute to 
peace and stability in the world. 
  Qian said: "China and France are mutually complementary in 
the economic and trade fields; and there is much that the two 
countries can do together. We welcome French companies to 
invest in China and compete fairly. This will boost economic 
and trade relations between the two countries." He added that 
France plays an important role in international affairs, and 
China and France can support each other and cooperate on many 
important international issues. 
  Qian also briefed Mitterrand on China's economic development 
and reforms. 
  At the end of the meeting, Mitterrand invited Qian to 
inscribe in the visitors' book, in which Qian wrote: "May the 
traditional Sino-French friendship grow continually." 
Mitterrand said: "I share the same wish." 
  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and Ambassador to 
France Cai Fangbo were present at the meeting.

  [Text] Paris, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and French Foreign Minister 
Allain Juppe met here today to discuss ways to promote relations 
between the two countries. 
  Both sides described the meeting as "positive and 
constructive" and Qian said China hopes bilateral relations will 
continue to develop steadily. 
  During the meeting, the French foreign minister said that 
"France is pleased to see that the two governments have resumed 
their traditional friendly relations by following the policies 
set by (former French President) General Charles de Gaulle in 
1964." 
  He said Qian's current visit to France demonstrates the 
normalization of relations between the two countries and that 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's forthcoming visit to 
China will be a major milestone in bilateral relations. 
  The French prime minister is expected to arrive in China on 
January 27, marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of 
Sino-French relations. 
  Juppe also expressed satisfaction over the signing earlier 
this month of a joint Sino-French communique on promoting 
bilateral relations, saying that France will adhere to and 
implement the principles set out in the communique. 
  He expressed the hope that French enterprises will be able 
to 
participate in the economic construction of China, and said the 
two countries should strengthen exchanges and cooperation in 
cultural, scientific-technological, and other fields. 
  The Chinese foreign minister said the signing of the joint 
communique, and his meeting with French President Francois 
Mitterrand earlier in the day, show that a new page has been 
turned in bilateral relations after a difficult period. 
  Qian said China agrees with the proposal that the foreign 
ministers of the two countries hold regular political 
consultations, and that his meeting with Juppe served as a good 
beginning to such consultations. 
  The French prime minister's forthcoming visit to China will 
be a major event, and will help bring exchanges between the two 
countries to a new level. 
  Foreign Minister Juppe also accepted Qian's invitation to 
visit China.

  [Text] Paris, January 24 (XINHUA) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur met with Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen here this morning, taking part in a 
45-minute friendly talk with him. 
  Balladur warmly welcomed Qian and said: "We are very glad to 
see that the Sino-French relationship has entered a new era. 
The relationship is based on mutual respect, equality, mutual 
benefit and full confidence. 
  "We should strengthen our consultations on major 
international issues, cooperation in economic trade and 
exchanges in culture and education, so as to further enhance 
Sino-French relations," he added. 
  Qian conveyed Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng's sincere 
greetings and respect to Balladur and said Li is looking forward 
to Balladur's visit to China in the near future. 
  Qian added that Balladur's visit, a major event in 
Sino-French relations, will promote the improvement and 
development of mutual beneficial trade relations between the two 
countries. 
  "We hope to see that French enterprises will enhance 
competitive ability and take their proper share of China's 
market," he added. 
  Qian noted that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the 
establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations. In 1964, the 
two countries set up diplomatic ties under the personal guidance 
of the then French President General Charles de Gaulle, Chinese 
Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. 
  "Under the current international circumstances, as states 
assuming important responsibilities in international affairs, 
China and France should maintain good relations as a factor to 
retain balance and stability in the world," Qian said. 
  Qian spoke highly about Balladur's efforts to improve 
Sino-French relations. 
  He stressed that China has been consistently treasuring its 
relationship with France and agrees to fully improve and enhance 
the traditional and friendly cooperative relations between the 
two countries. "It is beneficial to both of us and the world," 
he added. 
  "As long as the both sides are farsighted, Sino-French ties 
will surely move forward steadily for a long time," he said. 
  During the meeting, Balladur said that on the occasion of 
the 
30th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-French ties, 
the French Government decided to dispatch a major delegation to 
visit China with two aims -- to join the celebration activities 
and to make preparations for Balladur's visit to China. 
  "We hope that both sides will make common efforts to push 
forward Sino-French relations and contribute to peace, stability 
and development of the world," he added. 
  After the meeting, Balladur asked Qian to convey his sincere 
greetings and best wishes to Prime Minister Li Peng.

  [Text] Bern, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Gret Haller, president 
of the National Council of the Swiss Federal Assembly, said here 
today her country is looking forward to the visit of Qiao Shi, 
chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing 
Committee. 
  In an interview with Chinese reporters, Haller spoke highly 
about China's great efforts and achievements in its economic 
development. 
  She reviewed traditional friendship between the Swiss 
Federal 
Assembly and the China's NPC. The relations between the two 
sides have developed steadily since former President of the 
National Council Andre Gautier visited China in 1984. 
  Haller hoped that Qiao's visit to her country will promote 
mutual understanding and friendship between the two sides, and 
wished the visit a success. 
  Switzerland will be the second leg of Qiao's visit to three 
West European nations including Germany and Austria. 
  The purpose of his visit is to further mutual understanding 
and friendship and enhance the friendly ties and cooperation 
between China and the West European countries and their 
parliamentary exchanges in particular. 
  Qiao is currently in Germany. He is the first top Chinese 
legislator to visit Western Europe.

  [Text] Zurich, January 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Congress 
leader Qiao Shi flew into Zurich this afternoon from Munich, 
Germany, on a four-day official and goodwill visit to 
Switzerland. 
  This is the first visit to Switzerland by Qiao, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, at 
the invitation of President Gert Haller of the National Council 
of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. 
  Qiao said in a written speech upon his arrival that China 
and 
Switzerland have had friendly contacts for a long time. 
Switzerland is one of the first Western countries to have 
recognized the People's Republic of China and established 
diplomatic ties with Beijing. 
  China has always respected Switzerland's neutral position 
and 
attaches great importance to developing ties with this European 
nation, he said. 
  Over the past few years, the Chinese leader added, 
cooperation between the two countries has progressed smoothly in 
the fields of politics, economy, science and technology as well 
as culture. 
  "We are very pleased to note that the contacts and 
cooperation between China's NPC and the National Council of 
Switzerland's Federal Assembly have also been further 
developed," he added. 
  Qiao, who is in Europe on a three-nation tour which will 
also 
take him to Austria, said the purpose of his current visit to 
Switzerland is to acquaint himself with Switzerland's 
parliamentary and government leaders as well as friends from all 
walks of life here. 
  He also hoped to increase mutual understanding, deepen 
friendship and expand cooperation through the current visit so 
as to further push forward the friendly ties between the two 
countries and the two parliaments. 
  Qiao and his party were greeted at the airport by Ricardo 
Jagmetti, president of the Council of States of Switzerland, 
Erwin Schurtenberger, Swiss ambassador to China, Xin Futan, 
Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, and Jin Yongjian, Chinese 
permanent representative to the U.N. office at Geneva.

  [Text] Bern, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
said here today that it is possible for China and Switzerland to 
further develop their economic and technological cooperation. 
  Qiao made these remarks when he met with Flavio Cotti, 
Federal Councillor and head of the Federal Department of Foreign 
Affairs. Both sides exchanged their views on international and 
regional issues. 
  Qiao said Switzerland was one of the first Western countries 
to establish diplomatic ties with China. Since then, the two 
countries have enjoyed a good relationship. 
  He also said Switzerland pursues a policy of neutrality and 
non- interference in other countries' internal affairs which he 
said is similar to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence 
that China pursues. Bilateral ties have been based on a solid 
foundation, he added. 
  Qiao noted that since China implemented reform and opening 
to 
the outside world, the relations between the two countries have 
been further boosted. 
  "China has a big potential market, so it's possible for the 
two countries to further their economic and technological 
cooperation, which is beneficial to both sides," he said. 
  Extending his warm welcome to Qiao who is paying his first 
visit to Switzerland as the NPC chairman, Cotti said Qiao's 
visit will help promote the frequent and close dialogues between 
the two countries. 
  Cotti said he was satisfied with the growth of bilateral 
ties, adding that in the economic field, the two countries have 
made achievements which attracted wide attention. 
  "Switzerland is deeply impressed by China's rapid economic 
growth and the progress of its economic construction," he said. 
  Cotti also noted that many Swiss enterprises have invested 
in 
China and said that they will surely play a useful role in 
China's economic construction. 
  He expressed his hope for increasing the number of such 
enterprises while continuing to maintain the quality of 
cooperative projects. 
  He said Switzerland and China also share a very good 
relationship in culture. China's time-honored culture, in 
particular, has been a great influence on Switzerland. 
  Besides, cooperation between the two countries in the United 
Nations, the UNESCO and other international organizations has 
been strengthening all the time, he said. 
  Qiao arrived here from Zurich on Sunday [23 January] 
afternoon.

its reform and open its door wider. 
  Great changes have taken place in China over the past 15 
years, Qiao said during a meeting with Gret Haller, president of 
the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. 
  "We will try our best to attain the second strategic goal 
and 
bring the Chinese people a comparatively comfortable life by the 
end of this century," Qiao told Haller. 
  "Judging from the present situation, we can say that the 
goal 
is bound to be realized," he said. 
  Qiao said China's reform measures for 1993 brought about 
fruitful results, which are well recognized world-wide. 
  To maintain its political stability, he said, China should 
foster the development of its legal system. 
  China should draw up many new laws while some of the 
existing 
laws may need to be revised, he said. The NPC, as the 
legislative body, and its Standing Committee, face arduous tasks 
in this regard. 
  In addition, Qiao said, the central and local governments 
plan to formulate some badly-needed administrative and local 
regulations. 
  Qiao said China's status as a contracting party to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has not been 
resumed yet, but its economic reform in various fields should be 
converged with the commonly used norms and methods in the world. 
  Haller said that as Switzerland and China are far apart 
geographically and differ in culture, the exchanges between the 
two countries' parliaments are more important. 
  Haller, who visited China in 1976, said she very much 
admired 
the tremendous achievements China has made in economic 
development and other fields. 
  Qiao said he hoped that Haller would visit China again.

  [Text] Bern, 24 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the 
Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, held 
talks with Gret Haller, president of the Swiss Federal Assembly 
National Council, this morning. 
  During the talks, Haller said: Switzerland and China are far 
apart geographically and have different cultural backgrounds. 
Therefore, it is very important for their parliaments to conduct 
exchanges. 
  Haller had visited China in 1976. She said: Despite its 
huge population, China has satisfied the needs of its people for 
clothing, food, shelter, and transportation; it has achieved 
fruitful results in social security. She expressed her 
admiration for the tremendous achievements scored by China. 
  Qiao Shi briefed Speaker Haller on China's economic 
development. 
  Qiao Shi said: China's rural economic reform has brought 
tremendous changes to the countryside. Subsequent urban reform 
also promoted fast urban economic development and yielded great 
results. He indicated: It is possible that China will realize, 
ahead of schedule, the strategic objective of economic 
development it aims to achieve by the turn of the century. 
  He said: China will deepen reform nationwide and open wider 
to the outside world. Qiao Shi said emphatically: Only by 
maintaining stability at home and safeguarding peace 
internationally can China develop its economy and its people 
enjoy more political and economic freedoms. To maintain 
political stability, China still needs to strengthen its legal 
system.

  [Text] Bern, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, visiting 
chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing 
Committee, said here today that the friendly and cooperative 
ties between China and Switzerland have broad prospects. 
  At a luncheon given in honor of him by Gret Haller, 
president 
of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, 
Qiao said China and Switzerland have a long history of friendly 
contacts. 
  He said that since diplomatic ties were established between 
the two countries in 1950, bilateral relations have developed 
smoothly in the fields of politics, economy, culture, science 
and technology. 
  Such relations have grown in an all-round way over the past 
few years, Qiao said. The exchange of visits is on the increase 
while bilateral trade has jumped and economic and technological 
cooperation is fruitful. 
  "All these fully show that the friendly and cooperative 
relations between the two countries based on mutual respect, 
equality and mutual benefit have broad prospects," Qiao said. 
  He said China will implement a series of important reforms 
on 
taxation, finance and foreign trade this year. 
  As China's reform and opening up are going deeper, the 
economy will become more vigorous and dynamic, he said, adding 
that this will create more favorable conditions for furthering 
the all-round friendly cooperation between China and Switzerland. 
  Qiao said China's NPC is willing to deepen the mutual 
understanding and friendship between the two nations, expand 
bilateral cooperation and make its due contributions to bringing 
such relations to a new level. 
  He praised Switzerland, as an eternal neutral country and a 
residing place of the European organizations of the United 
Nations, for its unique contributions to promoting international 
cooperation and safeguarding world peace. 
  In her speech, Haller extended her warm welcome to Qiao, 
saying that it is her aspiration that the friendly cooperation 
between the two countries and the two parliaments will be 
further expanded.

  [Text] Bern, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Otto Stich, president 
of the Swiss Confederation, said here today that his country is 
very much interested in further expanding its economic ties with 
China. 
  Meeting with Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National 
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, here this afternoon, 
Stich said China, which has a long history, exerts important 
influence on the world and is playing an important role in the 
United Nations. 
  China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, he 
said, adding that the U.N. role in safeguarding the world peace 
is never like what it is playing now. 
  He said China's role in the international security is of 
great importance to the world peace and security. 
  Stich expressed his satisfaction with the growth of 
Switzerland- China relations and spoke highly of China's rapid 
economic development. 
  He said Switzerland is very much interested in further 
expanding its economic ties with China. "The two countries have 
cooperated well in the UNESCO. We hope such cooperation will be 
extended to other areas," he said. 
  Stich said he welcomed China restoring its status as a 
signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). 
  Qiao expressed thanks for it, saying that this will not only 
benefit China's domestic economic growth, but also help promote 
the convergence with international economy and cooperation and 
the world peace as well. 
  He told Stich that this morning he held talks with his 
German 
[as received] counterpart Gret Haller and met with head of 
Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Flavio Cotti and exchanged 
views with them on bilateral ties and issues of common interest. 
This will play a positive role in increasing mutual 
understanding and promoting the growth of bilateral ties, Qiao 
said. 
  He said after the establishment of diplomatic ties between 
the two countries in 1950, bilateral ties have been normally 
developed. 
  Following the implementation of the policy of China's reform 
and opening up, such ties have been progressing steadily. "We 
are satisfied with the development of bilateral economic ties 
and trade. The exchanges between the two countries in culture, 
science and technology are fruitful," he said. 
  Qiao said Switzerland is a country with high working 
efficiency and one of the highly developed countries in Europe. 
  "It is our hope that bilateral ties will be boosted in 
various fields under the care of the president," he said. 
  "We welcome more Swiss friends including members of the 
Federal Assembly and personages from all walks of life to China 
for visit. China is also willing to know more about Switzerland 
and draw on the latter's successful experiences," he said. 
  Strengthening personnel exchanges between the two sides will 
bring benefits to facilitating mutual understanding. At the 
same time, he said China welcomes more Swiss entrepreneurs to 
China for investment. 
  He said China pays great attention to maintaining its 
domestic stability. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council, it is willing to work together with all developing 
countries and developed countries including Switzerland to 
safeguard the world peace and promote the progress for the 
mankind. 
  "It is our consistent view that maintaining the world peace 
is closely linked with China's economic construction. 
  "So long as the world is peaceful and China is stable and 
united, its economic construction is hopeful," he said.

  [Text] The Ministry of Economic Affairs on 13 January 
assessed our country's 1993 achievements in protecting 
intellectual property rights and found that progress was made 
both in legislative and administrative measures. Minister of 
Economic Affairs P.K. Chiang said that he would offer 
explanations, write U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, and ask 
the United States to drop Taiwan from the Section 301 "priority 
watch list" during this year's review. 
  It is time again for the United States to carry out a review 
of the Section 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade Act. Every 
April, the United States publishes a blacklist of the countries 
which violate intellectual property rights. During an urgent 
situation last year, our country rapidly adopted the eight 
reserved clauses of the ROC- U.S. agreement on the protection of 
intellectual property rights but was still included on the 
"priority watch list." 
  The Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday held a 
interministerial coordination meeting on the protection of 
intellectual property rights and assessed our achievements last 
year in this regard. In 1993, our country adopted a cable 
television law, a trademark law, and a patent law; fulfilled its 
commitments to the "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) signed 
with the United States, and implemented measures to prevent the 
export of counterfeit goods. 
  P.K. Chiang said: "This year, our country will not suffer as 
much reprisal pressure as last year." He will write Kantor and 
ask the United States to remove Taiwan from the reprisal list. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-chiu pointed out after 
the meeting: Our country's measures to protect intellectual 
property rights were quite effective last year. We should 
continue, however, the unfinished legislative work this year in 
honoring the MOU. We have promised to adopt the video recording 
law by January of this year, but the draft law will be submitted 
to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation together with the radio 
and television law. 
  The integrated circuit layout protection law is another bill 
which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation. 
It has been decided that the industrial design law will not be 
separately enacted and will be incorporated into the patent law 
as an article on new design patents. The business secrets law 
is being studied by the Commercial Department [of the Ministry 
of Economic Affairs].

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
Friday [21 January] called on the free countries of the world to 
work together to prevent the revival of tyranny. 
  "We cannot let those countries and people working to rid 
themselves of tyrannical rule fall into slavery again," Lee said 
during an address to the World Freedom Day gathering here. 
  All countries should join hands to promote economic 
development and improve the people's livelihood in an effort to 
eliminate the source of world violence, the president said. 
  For the future of world liberty, the president added, the 
world should confirm the achievements in the Middle East and 
South Africa and condemn regimes which use political power to 
intervene in the democratic movement. The world should urge 
these countries to release political prisoners and encourage 
joint efforts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons, he 
said. 
  More than 500 political leaders from some 40 countries 
around 
the world were present at the gathering, sponsored by the World 
League for Freedom and Democracy and the Asian Pacific League 
for Freedom and Democracy. The organizations were established 
40 years ago with the purpose of promoting world freedom 
following the defection of 14,000 Chinese Communists POWs to 
Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 22 (CNA) -- The private sector is 
ready to respond to the government's call to help reduce 
Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan. 
  Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the Chinese National Association of 
Industry and Commerce, has announced that he will lead a 
254-member delegation to Japan February 27-March 5 to promote 
locally-made products there. It will be the largest Taiwan 
trade delegation ever to have visited Japan. 
  The group, comprising representatives from textile, sports, 
furniture, lighting, and stationery manufacturers, will make 
sales presentations in Tokyo and Osaka. 
  Two Japan-based trade organizations -- the Japan Federation 
of Economic Organizations and the Coordinating Council on 
Japanese-Sino Business of Sales -- will assist the delegation in 
its mission. 
  According to customs statistics, Taiwan's trade deficit with 
Japan was U.S.$14.2 billion last year, up 10.5 percent from 
1992. The imbalance is expected to increase to U.S.$15.5 billion 
this year as Taiwan further integrates itself into the world 
economy. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li, will also head a 
12-member official trade promotion delegation to Japan January 
23- February 3 in the hope of attracting more Japanese 
investment and technology transfers to Taiwan. They will visit 
Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sendai, and Kobe.

<F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 18 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan Tuesday 
[18 January] said ties between Taiwan and Thailand have been 
cordial and will continue to develop. 
  In 1993, he noted, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$1 
billion with Thailand, whose economy has grown substantially in 
the past decade. If the growth continues, Thailand will soon 
join the ranks of newly industrialized countries, he added. 
  Currently, he pointed out, both countries are working on an 
investment guarantee agreement, whose draft proposal was 
exchanged last February. In addition, the two sides are 
expected to sign a pact to avoid double taxation later this 
month. 
  The premier made the remarks while meeting with Marut 
Bunnak, 
speaker of the Thai House of Representatives and president of 
the Thai National Assembly. 
  Marut, leading a 14-member parliamentary delegation, arrived 
in Taipei Monday for a six-day visit. 
  Lien told the Thai speaker that about 50,000 Thai workers 
are 
working in Taiwan, making up the largest group of foreign 
laborers. Thai laborers have made contributions to Taiwan's 
economic development, Lien said. 
  Moreover, he noted, Taiwan investors channeled US$4.4 
billion 
into Thailand as of August 1993 and Taiwan residents made about 
500,000 visits to Thailand each year. 
  This is solid evidence of the close relationship between the 
two countries, he said. 
  The Thai senator [title as received] was accompanied during 
the visit by Director P.Y. Teng of the Foreign Ministry's East 
Asian and Pacific Affairs Department as well as Edmund Y. Liu, 
representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in 
Thailand.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- The Investment Commission 
has proposed relaxed restrictions on foreign and overseas 
Chinese investment in oil refineries, retail sale of petroleum 
products, house construction, real estate agencies and railroad 
transportation, a local newspaper reported Wednesday [19 
January]. 
  The ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS reported that the commission took 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and Organization 
of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regulations into 
consideration before proposing to lift prohibitions and 
limitations on foreign investments in the above fields. 
  Under the proposal, the report said, the ban on foreign 
investment in oil refineries and real estate agencies will be 
lifted. 
  In addition, restrictions on foreign investment in 
residential construction, water and electricity supply, and 
railway transportation will be eased, the report added. 
  Under the proposed changes, however, foreign investment in 
oil refineries will be limited to a 30 percent stake in the 
company. 
  The commission officials also said a ban on foreign 
investment in the railway industry will be lifted sometime in 
the future. 
  The easing of investment restrictions will be in line with 
economic liberalization plans and help develop Taiwan into a 
Asia- Pacific region business operations center, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 21 (CNA) -- The Finance Ministry 
will float NT [New Taiwan]$174 billion (US$6.56 billion) in 
government bonds in fiscal 1995 to effectively control sources 
of finance, a finance official said Friday [21 January]. 
  Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Finance Ministry's 
National 
Treasury Department said that before floating the bonds, his 
department will consult with the Central Bank of China to make 
sure the bonds will be issued on a loose capital market. 
  A loose capital market ensures that the government bonds 
will 
not trigger inflation and can prevent excessive liquidity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Interference From Beijing"] </F>
  [Text] Communist China has not lessened its longstanding 
efforts to isolate Taiwan and cut off the island's sources of 
weaponry supplies because of the steady improvement in economic 
and other civil relations between the two sides. 
  On Wednesday [12 January], mainland China and France 
simultaneously announced a communique in which Paris agreed not 
to authorize any new arms sale to Taiwan in the future. The 
joint communique was reached following a recent round of 
bilateral talks in Beijing. 
  Since late 1992, when France approved the sale of 60 Mirage 
fighter planes to Taiwan, Beijing had persistently pressed Paris 
to cancel the deal, using various retaliatory measures, 
including suspensions of a subway and several other big-ticket 
sales contracts awarded to French companies earlier. 
  Beijing apparently failed to win concession from Paris on 
this point. French Foreign Minister Alain Jupe told a news 
conference in Paris on the same day that the Mirage contract 
with Taiwan will be honored and that spare parts will be 
delivered. 
  The reason Paris acquiesced in Beijing's demand not to allow 
future arms sales to Taiwan is obviously because France wanted 
to do so to restore its relations with the mainland so as to win 
back its lost businesses and to facilitate its development of 
the mainland market. 
  But for all the commercial considerations, it is regrettable 
that the French government has given its consent to the demand 
of Beijing. The mainland has no valid reason to block Taiwan 
from purchasing weapons from abroad. 
  This is especially true in light of the fact that mainland 
China itself has continued to expand its air and navy forces in 
recent years, posing a threat to the security of Taiwan and in 
fact the whole region. 
  Taiwan wants to purchase weapons for only one purpose to 
defend itself against a possible military invasion from the 
mainland. Beijing has been on record that, if necessary it will 
not hesitate to take Taiwan by force. 
  Beijing has never relaxed its efforts to prevent Western 
nations from providing Taiwan with weapons. At the Settle 
summit in November, Communist Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
complained to President Bill Clinton of his predecessor's 
decision to sell 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan and demanded U.S. 
agreement not to allow new sales. In that same month, Beijing 
raised a similar demand with Germany when Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
visited the mainland. 
  Beijing's persistent intervention will make it more 
difficult 
for Taiwan to obtain the supply of high-performance weapons in 
the future. To cope, Taiwan must strengthen its investment in 
the development of military technology to reduce dependence on 
foreign supply. 
  Also on Wednesday, Beijing announced establishment of 
diplomatic relations with Lesotho, an African country which had 
maintained formal links with Taiwan since 1990. Over the years, 
Beijing has not only continued to prevent other nations from 
recognizing Taipei, but also tried all possible means to win 
recognition from nations which have diplomatic ties to this 
government. 
  The reason Beijing consistently does so is to isolate Taiwan 
from the international community and force the name of the 
Republic of China to disappear from the whole world. 
  This Beijing interference has indeed caused difficulties for 
Taiwan's foreign policy in the past but clearly it has not 
succeeded in isolating this island. Taiwan still maintains 
strong relations, in both official and unofficial forms, with 
countries around the world. 
  There is no reason that this will not be the case in the 
future, given Taiwan's continued efforts to develop democracy 
and economy as well as the island's willingness to fulfill its 
international obligations.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] In preparation for our country's accession to 
GATT, there will be a major readjustment in the system of 
guaranteed prices for agricultural products. Beginning in 1996, 
the system of guaranteed rice procurement prices will be 
changed, whereby only the year's first rice crop will be 
procured. Instead of growing a second crop, farmers will be 
encouraged to grow green manure or let the land lay fallow. The 
government will make up the price difference or offer farmers 
subsidies for fallow land. The Council of Agriculture stressed 
that this change in the guaranteed rice procurement price is 
necessary to soften the impact on agriculture of our country's 
accession to GATT. The council also noted that it hopes 
farmers' interests will not be affected by this change. Shen 
Wei-Kuo has filed the following report: 
  [Begin Wei-kuo recording] The Council of Agriculture 
convened a meeting on rice procurement and marketing on 13 
January. (Fu Le-yeh), head of the Agriculture and Food Grain 
Department, noted that beginning in 1996 the present system of 
guaranteed rice procurement prices will be changed, whereby only 
the first rice crop will be procured. As regards the second 
crop, the government will encourage farmers to grow green manure 
to enrich the soil or let the land lay fallow. The government 
will provide a subsidy of NT [New Taiwan] $27,000 yuan for every 
hectare of fallow land. If the farmers want to grow a second 
crop of rice instead of switching to food grain, then the 
government will continue procuring the rice in an appropriate 
manner and help them adapt. [passage omitted] 
  (Fu Le-yeh) stressed that balancing production and 
consumption as well as maintaining self-sufficiency remains the 
government rice policy. The rice acreage will still be 400,000 
hectares, and the annual output target will still be 1.6 million 
metric tons [end recording].

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "The Doors to Open Wider"] </F>
  [Text] China will allow foreign financial institutions to 
engage in renminbi business on an experimental basis, China's 
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli announced yesterday in a joint 
statement following the eighth session of the China-U.S. Joint 
Economic Committee. 
  The committee was reopened yesterday in Beijing for the 
first 
time since 1987. 
  Meanwhile, China also plans to allow foreign financial 
institutions to open branches in more major cities, according to 
the joint statement. 
  Liu also said China intends to make renminbi an 
internationally convertible currency when the time is ripe. As 
the first step toward this goal, China has unified its 
dual-track foreign exchange system. 
  In another development, Chen Yuan, Vice-Governor of the 
People's Bank of China, told the committee China will allow 
another one or two foreign insurance companies to enter the 
domestic market. 
  Currently, the American International Group (AIG) is the 
only 
foreign insurer doing business in China. 
  He said it will take time for China to work out a plan to 
allow foreign financial organizations to conduct renminbi 
business. 
  However, Chen said this year's financial and fiscal reforms 
will help promote the process. 
  In addition, he said other restrictions on foreign banks 
will 
also be relaxed with the unification of the tax system, adding 
identical treatment for both domestic and overseas banks will 
eventually be realized. 
  However, he said the time is still not ripe to open the 
securities market to foreign companies as the market remains 
small in scale and management and regulations have not yet been 
perfected. 
  Chen said with the development of China's securities 
industry 
and the deepening reform of the financial and foreign exchange 
systems, China will gradually open its securities market to 
foreign companies. 
  He said regulations governing the management of foreign 
financial organizations in China have been approved by the State 
Council and are expected to be made public in the near future 
after further revision. 
  Co-chairing the session with Liu, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen highlighted the U.S. interest in supporting 
China's efforts to develop and reform its domestic capital 
markets, including improving opportunities for the participation 
of foreign financial institutions. 
  He said the United States supports a strong, stable, 
prosperous and modern China. 
  Speaking highly of China's recent decisions to move forward 
with market-oriented reforms of its monetary, banking, tax and 
foreign exchange systems, Bentsen said the United States will 
intensify its technical support for these reforms. 
  Meanwhile, he said the United States will continue its 
staunch support for China's efforts to regain contracting party 
status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) on 
the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Market Access 
signed by the two countries. 
  He welcomed China's decision to unify its exchange rates and 
improve importers' access to foreign exchange as important steps 
on the road to Gatt accession and to full convertibility of 
renminbi. 
  The statement said the Chinese finance minister welcomes the 
promise of expanded U.S. technical assistance for China's 
reforms and appreciates the Unites States continued support for 
China's reattainment of Gatt contracting party status. 
  However, Liu also said he hoped the U.S. would remove 
obstacles to trade with China and further relax restrictions on 
high technology exports to China. 
  To advance the bilateral dialogue on particular issues of 
immediate interest, both of them agreed to establish initial 
working groups in three important areas, including monetary and 
banking issues, exchange system reform and investment and 
economic co- operation. 
  The groups should meet at an interval of six months, or as 
necessary, and report progress to the annual meeting of the 
committee.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Liu: "Open Mart Operations To Start in Shanghai"] </F>
  [Text] The People's Bank of China, the nation's central 
bank, will start its open market operations this year in 
Shanghai, according to its Vice-Governor Zhu Xiaohua. 
  Such operations are among the bank's activities designed to 
regulate the money supply. The operations, involving the 
purchase and sale of government securities, can effectively 
expand or contract the supply of money in the banking system. 
This, in turn, alters bank reserves, causing a multiplier 
effect on the supply of credit and, therefore, on economic 
activity in general. 
  The Shanghai Securities Exchange has been selected by the 
People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance to be the 
base on which the issuing, trading and clearing of treasury 
bonds will be established, according to the China Securities 
newspaper. 
  All the 2,600 trading seats in the Shanghai Securities 
Exchange can apply for opening trading of treasury bonds. A 
special trading hall for the treasury bonds has also been 
prepared. 
  Meanwhile, the Shanghai Securities Exchange will soon be 
connected by computer with securities trading centres in 
Guangzhou, Shenyang, Chengdu and Haikou. Thus two-way trading 
between the Shanghai Securities Exchange and these centres can 
be expected. 
  Capital clearing will be conducted through the central 
bank's 
computer system, which links most of the bank's branches across 
the country, and the clearing systems of the Shanghai Securities 
Exchange and the country's major banks, securities companies and 
trust and investment companies. 
  Zhu said the key to the open market operations is setting 
reasonable interest rates for treasury bonds, which should be 
adaptable to changes in the market. 
  He said the treasury bonds must carry interest rates higher 
than that of bank deposits of the same term but lower than that 
of bank loans of the same term. 
  Only then will treasury bonds be attractive to investors, 
while at the same time banks can prevent improper applications 
for loans to buy treasury bonds. 
  Zhu said that with the beginning of the open market 
operations, the central bank will regulate the money supply 
through the purchase and sale of treasury bonds and financial 
bonds in the open market and foreign exchange in foreign 
exchange markets.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of Finance 
will expand at certain places the experiment concerning 
first-class government bond dealers. After submitting an 
application to and obtaining approval from the authorities, 
nonpolicy-nature banks, securities companies, trust and 
investment companies, and other nonbank monetary organizations 
may serve as first-class government bond dealers of the People's 
Republic of China, join the 1994 national group of contract 
dealers of government bonds, and directly sign a contract with 
the Ministry of Finance to deal in government bonds. 
  First-class government bond dealers, as an important medium 
of the government bond market, shoulder certain obligations in 
committing themselves to marketing government bonds and 
promoting the development of the government bond market. At the 
same time, they enjoy the right to and precedence in dealing 
with the central bank in the open government bond market. 
  A responsible person concerned at the Ministry of Finance 
has 
pointed out: To expand the experiment involving first-class 
government bond dealers at selected places is an important 
measure for reforming the government bond market. To promote 
the work actively and properly, the Ministry of Finance, working 
together with the People's Bank of China and the China 
Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, has 
formulated the "Procedures for Managing First-Class Government 
Bond Dealers of the People's Republic of China" and the 
"Procedures for Examining and Affirming First-Class Government 
Bond Dealers." They will jointly examine and approve the 
applications of first-class government bond dealers. Finance 
organizations may, as of today, submit their applications and 
their intention to deal in the first issuing of 1994 government 
bonds to the State Debts Administration of the Ministry of 
Finance.

<F P=106> [By Pan Zhongming: "Managing Currency to be Theme of </F>
Lectures"] 
  [Text] Gaiacorp, a London-based international currency 
management firm will strengthen its presence in China. 
  It will do this by enhancing its cooperation with China's 
financial education department and increasing its investment in 
China's key infrastructure construction this year. 
  Liu Maolin, manager of the firm's Beijing representative 
office, made the announcement over the weekend. 
  Liu said, in the field of financial education, the firm will 
conduct a series of lectures on basic finance and sophisticated 
international currency management. 
  The firm is seeking opportunities for giving these lectures, 
setting up scholarship funds and investing to facilitate the 
education departments in the universities in Beijing. 
  The total investment in this sector will be between 2 and 3 
million yuan ($229,000 and $344,000). 
  The firm also plans to further its involvement in the key 
infrastructure projects of China this year. 
  It will explore co-operative opportunities with the Bank of 
China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and other 
financial and investment firms, domestic and overseas alike, for 
investment in the Three Gorges Project and Shanghai's Pudong New 
Area. 
  Liu said that his firm planned to introduce its 
sophisticated 
and patented techniques in finance to China, but not sell it. 
He said China can learn its technology through "cooperation 
projects." 
  The firm, handling daily transaction of floated currencies 
worth around $2 billion, contends it has the technology to 
predict future trends in 24 different international currencies. 
  To guarantee the success of the firm's plan, a high-profile 
delegation will soon be organized by the firm's headquarters in 
London to visit Beijing. 
  The delegation hopes to make an overall inspection of 
China's 
financial and educational departments.

  [Text] China's southernmost province of Hainan Island has 
retained the mainland's old property tax system to maintain its 
attractiveness for foreign property investors. The move may 
provoke leaders in Beijing as the Chinese Government has 
instructed that the new property gains tax of between 30 percent 
to 60 percent had to come into effect across the country on 
January 1. 
  "At present, the central government has no controls on local 
authorities regarding the implementation of the new tax regime," 
said Thomas Chan, reader in the department of business studies, 
Hong Kong Polytechnic. "But it is just a transitionary stage. 
The government will pressure all local officials to enforce the 
new system, probably after Chinese New Year," he added. 
  Zeng Haorong, mayor of Haikou, the provincial capital, said 
yesterday in Hong Kong: "The province is studying the 
implementation of the new property gains tax. But, before the 
details are finalised, we will continue to impose the old 
property tax even for projects concluded after January 1." He 
gave no information about the timetable of the review, but 
added: "We have to be extremely careful about the introduction 
of the new property gains tax and ensure that foreign investors' 
confidence will not be hit." 
  Property development is one of the largest industries on 
Hainan island, one of China's five special economic zones. 
Hainan has set up more than 140 development zones throughout the 
province. The island was also targeted under last July's 
campaign to clamp down on property speculation in China. The 
property industry was hit hard during the second half of last 
year. 
  Mr Zeng, along with the director of Hainan's Economic Co- 
operation Department, Xiao Ceneng, and the mayor of Sanya, Wang 
Yongchun, attended the inauguration ceremony of the Hainan 
Institute at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
(HKUST).

<F P=106> ["XINHUA Letter Box:": "The Movement and Realignment of </F>
Property Rights"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (XINHUA) -- The movement and 
realignment of property rights is a general term used to 
describe changes in property rights. It is mainly used to 
describe changes in such property rights as arising from 
enterprise mergers, amalgamations, sales, and auctions, as well 
as purchases of shares in enterprises. 
  Since our country introduced the policies of reform and 
opening up, lateral ties among enterprises have developed 
constantly. During the process, some enterprises whose 
liabilities exceed assets, whose production capacities cannot 
satisfy the requirements of the economic scale, and whose 
economic returns are poor have been amalgamated, in an active or 
passive manner, with enterprises generating good economic 
returns. Some enterprises have bought the property rights of 
other enterprises, thus annexing the latter by depriving them of 
their qualifications as legal persons or by changing their 
status as legal entities. Competent departments have begun to 
sell the property rights of some small state-owned industrial 
and commercial enterprises, especially those whose liabilities 
exceed assets, those which approach bankruptcy, those which have 
chronically operated poorly, and those which have suffered 
losses or made meager profits for successive years. Some 
localities have established enterprise auction markets to 
auction off property rights. Some have sold property rights in 
their entirety while others have sold them separately in the 
form of shares. Since the early eighties, Sino-foreign joint 
ventures have mushroomed and the enterprise shareholding system 
has gradually taken shape. There have been mutual purchases of 
shares between state-owned and foreign-funded enterprises, among 
state-owned enterprises, between state-owned enterprises and 
enterprises not under state ownership, and between enterprises 
and individuals. This has resulted in interchanges among various 
principal holders of property rights. Shares and share 
certificates issued by joint stock enterprises have been traded 
openly through listing or over the counter. The movement of 
property rights has been fairly constant. 
  The aforementioned changes in property rights are generally 
termed the movement and realignment of property rights. They 
are the positive results of reform of our country's economic 
structure. According to state provisions, assets must be 
evaluated and the evaluation results must be verified by 
competent departments prior to the movement and realignment of 
property rights.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Fraud Seen in Joint Ventures"] </F>
  [Text] State auditors are calling for tightened scrutiny 
of Sino-foreign joint ventures to curb financial malpractices. 
  A recent investigation of 572 joint ventures in 14 
provinces, 
conducted by the State Auditing Administration, disclosed the 
increasing illegal practices in foreign funding, such as: 
  --A big part of promised foreign investment is not channeled 
into the joint ventures. Of the 572 enterprises' 2.609 billion 
yuan ($300 million) in registered capital that should have been 
provided by foreign investors, only 43 percent was actually 
handed over. 
  --Many investors provided outdated machinery and technology 
to fulfill their contractual investment. What's worse is that 
such investments also can entitle the investor to dividends, 
which will result in long-term harm to the Chinese partners. 
  --Some investors use various means to withdraw their 
investment after the joint ventures have been establisted. Many 
borrow money from the enterprises and some sell raw materials 
and equipment to the joint ventures at prices higher than on the 
international market. 
  --Some joint ventures were set up with loans from Chinese 
banks or money borrowed from Chinese partners. Such 
enterprises, which are actually solely Chinese funded, are 
created to take advantage of the country's preferential policies 
for foreign-funded ventures. 
  "All these problems call for closer attention from high 
levels," said Xu Yudi, director of the State Auditing 
Administration's foreign funds application audit department. 
  "It's time for action," Xu said. 
  He said joint ventures are no doubt playing an ever big role 
in introducting foreign capital and advanced technologies. 
  However, if these illegal practices cannot be rooted out, 
not 
only will joint ventures be unable to introduce foreign capital 
and advanced equipment and technology to China, but they also 
will bring about long-term losses to Chinese interests. 
  "We can't just sit by and see these problems become more and 
more severe," Xu said. 
  He said the State should organize an examination of the 
nation's joint ventures that would involve the departments of 
foreign trade, administration of industry and commerce, customs 
and administration of State properties. 
  Foreign equipment and technology should also be evaluated 
more closely to stop such subterfuge, he said. 
  Xu said the intensified monitoring of joint ventures would 
not affect foreign investors' interests since an improved 
investment environment and management will help protect their 
legal rights. 
  With some joint ventures, a major problem is tax evasion. 
For example, an audit last year of 109 large joint ventures 
showed they owed the State 27.82 million yuan ($3.2 million) in 
back taxes and other overdue charges.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "More Loans For Foreign Ventures"] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of China, the country's major foreign 
exchange bank, pledges that it will continue to lend a helping 
hands to support foreign-funded ventures. 
  More credit is expected to be extended to foreign-funded 
ventures in 1994, said Liang Jin'e, deputy general manager of 
the bank's first credit department. 
  But Liang declined to specify how much the total credit will 
amount to. The bank last year supplied $4.3 billion in foreign 
exchange to foreign-funded ventures, 28 percent more than in 
1992. 
  It also granted 42.5 billion yuan ($4.88 billion) in loans 
denominated in renminbi, a rise of 34.4 percent from 1992. 
  Last year's total credit amount and the rate of increase 
were 
records for the bank. 
  While promising active support for foreign-funded ventures, 
Liang warned that the Bank of China will not be able to meet the 
demands of all firms. 
  She said the bank will channel its limited capital into 
supporting selected firms according to the country's industrial 
policy. 
  The beneficiaries will include enterprises in the energy, 
transportation and telecommunication industries. Priority will 
also be given to export-oriented and technologically-advanced 
firms. 
  Liang said those with high profitability and strong ability 
to repay debt will also be on the preferred list. 
  To boost the economic links between the mainland and Taiwan, 
priority will be given to Taiwan-funded firms. The bank is 
trying to organize specialized loans for these firms. 
  The bank will closely watch the investment activities of 
large and well-known overseas companies, believing that any 
interest by them in investing in large projects in China deserve 
priority. 
  Lians said the bank will be cautious in lending to 
foreign-funded ventures engaged in real estate speculation or 
the importation of outdated equipment. 
  It will also be careful with firms that have not repaid, on 
schedule, loans already granted by the bank. 
  To those able to make up losses in the near future, the bank 
will continue to give its support. But to those with no hope of 
making profits, the bank will press for repayment. 
  Liang said the bank will supervise and urge foreign-funded 
enterprises to operate efficiently. 
  She said the bank will try to improve its regulations on 
lending to protect the bank's assets. 
  "It is time for us to make use of our experience and solve 
the problems," Lians said. 
  To better manage its loans to foreign-funded ventures, the 
bank will also strengthen the training of its staff. 
  As a major channel for utilizing foreign investment, the 
Bank 
of China has been following a credit policy that favours 
foreign-funded ventures. Since 1980, the bank has provided 
foreign-funded ventures with $18.3 billion in foreign exchange 
and 135.6 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) in renminbi. 
  About 50 percent of the foreign-funded ventures in China 
have 
opened accounts with the Bank of China. Of these, 20 percent 
have received loans from the bank. 
  Analysts said the bank's active support of foreign-funded 
ventures should be strengthened by the growth in savings 
deposits. 
  By the end of last year, the outstanding savings in renminbi 
had surpassed 204.86 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) while savings 
denominated in foreign exchange totalled $27.8 billion.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Zhao Xinglin (6392 5281 2651): "All-Round </F>
Growth Registered in Foreign Trade in Beijing Last Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Thanks to the new 
concept of "large-scale economic and trade activities, extensive 
circulation, and huge markets" put forth by Beijing in exploring 
foreign economic and trade work, all-round growth was registered 
in various economic and trade targets in 1993, as shown by the 
following facts: The total import and export volume reached 
$3.04 billion, increasing by 40.5 percent over the previous 
year; a total of 3,752 foreign-invested enterprises were newly 
approved, with a contracted investment total of $10.39 billion, 
increasing by 1.7 and 4.3 times respectively on the previous 
year. 
  There were four striking features in Beijing's foreign 
economic and trade development in 1993. 1) Over 20 
transnational corporations, including such large and renowned 
companies as Matsushita Electronics Industries of Japan, 
Unilever of the UK, Eveready Batteries and Kraft General Foods 
of the United States, ABB of Germany [country as published; ABB 
is a joint Swedish, Swiss concern], and so on invested in 
Beijing. 2) Major breakthroughs was made in real estate 
development with foreign capital, as 176 foreign-invested 
housing projects were newly approved with a total contracted 
amount of $5.85 billion, which has injected new vigor and 
vitality into Beijing in its advance toward becoming a modern 
metropolis. 3) In the construction of scientific and 
technological development zones and small industrial zones, 
stress was put on the development of a number of 
foreign-invested enterprises featuring advanced technology and 
export orientation, and priority was given to the development of 
new, high-technology industry. A bumper harvest was reaped by 
Beijing's experimental hi-tech industrial development zone last 
year, with total revenues gained from technical services, 
industry, and trade exceeding 10 billion yuan. The zone has 
increased its supply of additional commodities for export. 4) 
Reform of the foreign trade structure was deepened, and a new 
pattern embracing specialized foreign trade corporations, 
industrial and trade corporations, locally run export 
enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises began to take 
shape. 
  Among Beijing's industrial units, a number of large 
state-owned enterprises, with the cooperation of some 
internationally famous production enterprises, are undergoing 
transformation with new high technology, and backbone export 
enterprises have emerged in large numbers.

<F P=106> [By reporter Tian Huiming (3944 1920 2494): "Economists </F>
Discuss the Significance of the Publication of the Book Series 
`Reform Faces a New Century'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Xue Muqiao, 
the noted 90-year old economist who seldom goes outdoors, turned 
up at the Jinglun Hotel, Beijing, on 20 January and met with 
economic experts Liu Guoguang, Wu Jinglian, Zhang Zhuoyuan, Li 
Jiange, and others, to discussthe practical significance of 
publication of the book series "Reform Faces a New Century." 
  The series consists of eight books, and its chief editor is 
Xue Muqiao and its deputy chief editors Liu Guoguang and Wu 
Jinglian. Its editorial committee includes economists Zhang 
Zhuoyuan and Dai Yuanchen, and a number of middle-aged and young 
economic experts including Li Jiange, Zhou Xiaochuan, Guo 
Shuqing, and Lou Jiwei. 
  These experts and scholars have personally participated in 
designing and putting into practice China's reform plans over 
the past dozen years or more, so the series possesses the 
characteristics of integrating theory and practice and of being 
exceedingly functional. 
  Xue Muqiao wrote a preface to the series. He reviewed the 
course of new China's construction and reform and found that 
arguments have mainly centered on two main lines: First, the 
question of whether to take economic development or class 
struggle as the central task. Second, the question of whether 
the pattern of economic structure should be the allocation of 
resources by planning or by the market. We should say there is 
already common consensus on these two questions now. As this 
century is drawing to a close and the next is unfolding, 
economic theorists should make good preparations and can seize 
the opportunity for all time to push China's reform and lay a 
foundation for take-off in the next century. 
  At the meeting of economists, Wu Jinglian said: The most 
important moment of reform, which I have looked forward to for 
many years, has finally come. Given so many new reform measures 
and numerous big and small things, it is necessary to seriously 
study and carefully design reform plans. If we are just a 
little careless, it will probably lead to disturbances. 
  He Yang argued that it is no longer practical to run the 
economy through the methods of formalism, mass movements, and 
administrative orders, instead, economic and legal means should 
be used, and that what is important is strengthening study of 
market economic theories. 
  Zhou Xiaochuan said that the fruits of economic theory study 
over the years have been incorporated into central documents, 
directly influencing economic life, and that forward-looking 
economic theories will inevitably play an important role in 
China's reform. 
  Li Jiange told this reporter that the problem of inflation 
in 
the economy is absolutely not caused by the pushing forward of 
reform, and that reform is intended to suppress inflation, and 
this view must be clearly elaborated theoretically.

(1728 6930 0524): "State-Owned Enterprises, Unload Your Heavy 
Historical Burden"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- At a time when reform 
has entered a new historical period, China's several hundred 
thousand state-owned enterprises, which are famed as the 
"backbone of the Republic," are facing severe challenges today: 
how to unload their heavy historical burden and go to the 
battlefront with a light pack so that they can start from the 
same starting line together with enterprises of different 
ownerships to compete for the great wealth and to recreate their 
images. 
  Undoubtedly, state-owned enterprises must be given great 
credit for the prosperity of the Republic today and for the 
strong material base on which reform and opening up are being 
carried out. However, as economic structural reform deepens and 
the construction of a socialist market economy accelerates, 
difficulties encountered by state-owned enterprises in 
production and management have become increasingly acute. The 
heart of the problem is their slow growth in economic 
efficiency. For example, profits delivered and taxes paid by 
state-owned industrial enterprises grew a mere 1.1 times between 
1980 and 1992, far below the 3.14 times registered by collective 
enterprises and the 33.5 times registered by enterprises of 
other types of ownership. There are some state-owned 
enterprises which are unable to grow or which even suffer large 
losses. It is true that the predicament of state-owned 
enterprises today was caused by the shortcomings of the unitary 
planned economic system which the country implemented for a long 
period. However, we must not deny that the heavy historical 
burden on the shoulders of state- owned enterprises is an 
important reason why the "dragon" cannot take off. 
  Speaking at a national conference on restructuring the 
economy late last year, a principal responsible person from the 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy made a resounding 
call: To change course in accordance with the requirement of a 
modern enterprise system, state-owned enterprises must resolve 
the question of their heavy historical burden in a unified way. 
This has struck a sympathetic chord in various quarters, 
particularly among the vast numbers of state-owned enterprises. 
Entrepreneurs generally agree that the call points to an 
important link in reforming state-owned enterprises and that the 
opportunity offered by reform should be seized to resolve this 
issue of the "burden" once and for all. 
  How to unload the "burden?" It can be unloaded through 
reform and by approaching the problem from two directions, the 
state and the enterprises. An authoritative analysis carried 
out by a state department indicates that the historical "burden" 
on the shoulders of state-owned enterprises consists of four 
major thing, namely enterprises' debt burden; an inadequate 
accumulation to cover the social insurance of veteran workers; 
the transfer, unemployment, and rehiring of surplus personnel; 
and social undertakings carried out by enterprises. 
  To lift state-owned enterprises' historical burden and to 
enable them to operate according to a new system, the paramount 
issue is to rationally adjust the structure of their assets and 
liabilities and to resolve the question of their debt burdens 
based on the need for fair competition in the market. The idea 
adopted by the departments concerned is to determine, on a 
case-by-case basis, the amount and ratio of the debts borne by 
enterprises as a result of the change from appropriations to 
loans, and to transform these loans into invested capital in the 
form of increased state investment. The question of other types 
of debts can also be resolved by a variety of means, including 
transforming creditor's rights into shareholder's rights. As to 
the difficult problem arising from shortages of accumulation to 
cover veteran workers' social insurance, it should be resolved 
by exploring new approaches to replace workers' insurance with 
social insurance and to do so in a unified manner. In the 
process of reforming the system of property rights through 
auctioning off state assets, carrying out mergers, and adopting 
a stockholding system, experiments may be conducted to 
appropriate a certain proportion of social insurance funds from 
state assets for use in covering veteran workers' social 
insurance. This approach can unload the "heavy burden" 
currently borne by the backs of enterprises while removing 
veteran workers' concerns about life after retirement. 
  Surplus manpower is another difficult problem caused by the 
protracted implementation of a planned economic system. The 
current situation is that there are too many surplus personnel 
in state- owned enterprises, and the reform of the enterprise 
system and adjustment of the industrial structure will create an 
additional large number of surplus personnel. After analyzing 
this issue, an authoritative person hit the nail on the head 
with the remark: If the question of "excess employment" in 
state-owned enterprises is not resolved, fair competition 
between state-owned enterprises and other types of enterprises 
will become empty talk. To resolve this question, the state has 
decided that surplus personnel created in the course of 
enterprise reform should be transferred primarily to tertiary 
industries and that the state will give these preferential 
treatment in terms of taxes, credit, and real estate. At the 
same time, it encourages some workers to transfer to village and 
town enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and private 
enterprises. It also urges workers to themselves look for work. 
However, workers at state-owned enterprises, after leaving 
state-owned enterprises, should enjoy rights to and interests in 
social insurance and housing commensurate with their years of 
service. In resolving the question of enterprises carrying out 
social undertakings -- the fourth major difficulty encountered 
by state-owned enterprises -- the state has made clear the 
policy of gradually stripping enterprises of their nonproductive 
undertakings. Schools for dependents, logistical undertakings, 
and services operated by enterprises and other social functions 
undertaken by them for long periods should be hived off as soon 
as possible. Some of the hived off functions are to be taken 
over by governments, some by independent social organizations, 
and some by enterprises established solely for such purposes. 
  The time will eventually arrive for the dragon to take off. 
Through restructuring and innovation, state-owned enterprises 
will surely be able to meet the various severe challenges of 
economic competition in the marketplace with a new image. State 
enterprises will certainly regain their magnificent image, like 
the dragon soaring to the sky!

<F P=106> [Article by staff correspondent Zhang Zhibin (1728 1807 </F>
2430) and staff reporter Fang Jiangshan (2455 3068 1472): "One 
High, One Even: Wages Trend in `93"] 
  [Text] Although prices increased at a rather high rate in 
1993, it seemed that the people's livelihood was not affected 
too seriously, because workers wages increased at a higher rate 
than the rate of price increases. It was learned from the 
authoritative state departments that, in 1993, total wages of 
workers amounted to some 477 billion yuan, up by 83.1 billion 
yuan or 21.1 percent. The average worker's wage was 3,236 yuan, 
up by 525 yuan or 19.4 percent over the previous year. By 
reviewing the basic trend of wages last year, we found the basic 
characteristic of "one high, one even" in wage increases last 
year. 
<H5>  Reasons for "One High, One Even" </H5>
  "One high" refers to the high rate of increase for wages 
compared with previous years. Compared with 1992 and 1991, wage 
increases in 1993 were 3.5 and 10.1 percentage points higher 
respectively. The comparatively high rate of increase was 
mainly caused by economic growth and price increases. In 1993, 
the national economy continued to grow at a rather high speed, 
and a lot of enterprises issued more bonuses to workers or 
raised wages. In addition, the general price level, especially 
for goods closely related to people's daily lives, rose 
substantially. In order to ensure that the people's living 
conditions would not be worsened, many localities increased 
price subsidies. According to calculations, economic growth 
contributed to over 50 percent of the additional wages, and 
price increases contributed to over 30 percent of the additional 
wages. 
  "One even" refers to the even monthly rate of wage 
increases. 
From the beginning of the year to the end, the rate of increase 
of workers' total wages always stood at around 20 percent, and 
there was little variation from one month to the other. The 
difference between the highest rate of increase, which was in 
November, and the rate in December was only 2.9 percentage 
points. These stable and even rates of increase over the whole 
year have rarely been seen in recent years. This situation was 
caused, first, by the fact that economic development during the 
"off season" in 1993 did not slow down, and a rather high growth 
rate was maintained from the beginning of the year. Second, 
self-control mechanisms for wage increases in enterprises are 
being built up gradually, and many institutions paid attention 
to reserve certain funds when business is good to meet their 
needs in periods when business is less satisfactory. This 
prevents wage increases from being affected by seasonal changes 
in business results. 
<H5>  Analysis of the Results of Wage Changes </H5>
  By analyzing the results of the wage changes in 1993, we may 
find the following facts: 
  --As compared with the economic growth situation, wage 
increases remained in a normal condition. With the price factor 
deducted, total actual wages increased by 4.8 percent in 1993, 
and this was lower than the growth rate in domestic production, 
which was 13 percent (according to comparable prices); 
meanwhile, the average rate of increase in real wage income was 
3.4 percent, and this was lower than the increase in social 
productivity, which was 10.9 percent. 
  --The gap between the wage income of workers in different 
types of economic entities widened. The average wage of workers 
in state- owned economic units was 3,441 yuan, an increase of 
19.6 percent; for workers in urban collective units it was 2,436 
yuan, an increase of 15.5 percent; and for workers in other 
types of economic units it was 5,215 yuan, an increase of 31.5 
percent. Among various types of economic units, wage income in 
collective units increased at the lowest rate, wages in various 
types of the mixed economy increased fastest, and those in 
state-owned units were in the middle. The ratio of average 
wages in collective units to state-owned units to all types of 
joint ventures widened from 1:1.37:1.88 in 1992 to 1:1.41:2.14 
in 1993. 
  --The average wage income of workers in production 
enterprises increased faster than in nonprofit-making social 
institutions and administrative institutions. According to 
statistics, the average wage income of workers in enterprises 
was close to 3,566 yuan, and increased by 21.7 percent over 
1992; the average wage income of workers in nonprofit-making 
social institutions was 3,173 yuan, and increased by 15.6 
percent; and the average wage income of workers in 
administrative institutions was 3,092 yuan, and increased by 
only 11.1 percent. The rate of increase in wage income in 
enterprises was respectively 6.1 percentage points and 10.6 
percentage points higher than in nonprofit-making social 
institutions and administrative institutions. Income gaps 
between workers in these three types of institutions widened 
further. Substantial differences also existed in the wage 
incomes of enterprise workers in different trades and localities 
as the economic results of the enterprises varied greatly. In 
particular, the wage income of workers in enterprises which were 
forced to partly or fully suspend operations was even lower. 
  --There were substantial differences in rates of wage 
increases in different areas. As economic development in the 
southeastern coastal area was fast and attained a high level, 
the rate of increase in wages there was much higher than in the 
interior areas. According to November's statistics, total wages 
in the coastal areas mostly increased at a rate above 25 
percent; in particular, rates of increase in Jiangsu and 
Guangdong were above 30 percent. However, almost all of the 
interior provinces recorded growth rates of less than 20 
percent, and the rate in Shaanxi was only 10.9 percent. Because 
there are a large number of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises in the three northeastern provinces, the rate of 
wage increases was rather low there, and they were all below 20 
percent, and the rate in Heilongjiang was only 9.1 percent. In 
areas where the economy grew fast and wages also increased fast, 
substantial differences also existed in the actual rate of wage 
income increases from one district to another. 
<H5>  Main Problems With Current Wage Changes </H5>
  As the self-control mechanism in enterprises to adjust wage 
increases was not perfect enough, the economic efficiency of 
wage expenditure is not high enough at present, and this is the 
most prominent problem in the current situation in wage changes. 
It is known that many enterprises continue to issue bonuses 
while operating in the red. Some enterprises even continue to 
promote workers to higher grades when their operations have been 
suspended partly or completely and when they find it hard to 
issue wages normally. In many enterprises, the purpose of 
adopting a universal labor contract system and 
post-and-skill-related wage system is to increase wages. Most 
enterprises hope that they can pay more wages to their workers 
but few people care about the economic efficiency of wage 
expenditure. 
  Some experts in this field hope that the state authorities 
will relax controls over total wage expenditure in enterprises 
in an orderly way and will allow market forces to adjust wage 
increases in enterprises. Through the 
"wage--costs--prices--demand" mechanism, the issuance of wages 
will be linked with the survival of enterprises, and the problem 
will thus be better resolved.

  [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government has decided to launch a nationwide "employment 
project" this year aimed at helping long-term jobless people. 
  "The project will also serve China's target of keeping the 
nationwide jobless rate within three percent", said Zhang 
Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the Labor 
Ministry, in an interview with XINHUA today. 
  The project will create more job chances for the unemployed 
by offering special services and administration through the 
country's 10,000 job-introduction agencies, 2,200 job-training 
centers and over 200,000 labor service enterprises. 
  China has already achieved marked results in arranging jobs 
for the jobless, according to the official. Statistics from the 
Labor Ministry showed that in 1993 alone a total of 7 million 
jobless people found jobs. The total unemployed nationwide has 
dropped sharply from 11 million to the present four million in 
the past couple of years. 
  The official said that the vast majority of the unemployed 
can now find new jobs within six months with the help of China's 
employment service system. 
  The jobless people who have been out of work for over six 
months account for 20 percent of the total jobless figure. 
  "The employment project will focus on helping these 
long-term 
jobless people," the official stressed. 
  The Labor Ministry stipulates that enterprises which employ 
long- term unemployed people are entitled to receive their 
previous unemployment relief fund partially or wholly, as 
subsidies for wage payment. 
  Preferential treatment in terms of finance, taxation and 
choice of sites will be granted to jobless people who are to be 
self- employed, the official said. 
  The long-term jobless who cannot find jobs even after job 
training will be given temporary jobs in the locally-run labor 
service enterprises until they find new jobs. 
  For those who reject any form of employment without any 
sensible reasons, the government will cease to grant them 
unemployment relief funds. 
  The official said that the employment project will first be 
launched in a dozen provinces and municipalities, including 
Beijing and Shanghai Cities, and Shandong, Hebei and Zhejiang 
Provinces. 
  The project will then be carried out on a nationwide scale 
in 
1995.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Industrial Sales and </F>
Production Soar Last Month"] 
  [Text] China's industrial sector regained its vitality in 
both production and sales in the last month of 1993, according 
to December statistics released by the State. 
  The Statistics Bureau said the output of industrial firms 
hit 
366.4 billion yuan ($42.6 billion) in December, up 29.8 percent 
from the same month in 1992. 
  The increase was 6.2 percent higher than the average 
industrial output growth in 1993. 
  Bureau economists said banks eased their controls on the 
money supply late last year, spurring industrial production at 
the end of the year. 
  In December, banks lent 40.4 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) 
more 
than in the same month in 1992, they noted. 
  Inspired by the relaxed financial situation, retail sales 
also jumped 35.3 percent over the same one-month period last 
year to reach 155 billion yuan ($18 billion). 
  This was 5.6 percent higher than the year-on-year monthly 
growth rate in November 1993. 
  The bureau said the rebound in production and sales was 
partly attributable to the government's new reform measures. 
  In December, when the central government decided to reform 
its tax system and further deregulate prices, grain and 
household electrical appliances became hot sellers on the 
domestic market. 
  The buying spree for agricultural products and 
high-value-added durables triggered a year-on-year consumer 
prices growth of 23.9 percent in the 35 largest cities, the 
bureau noted. 
  The volume of grain sales increased by 1.41 million tons 
over 
December 1992. 
  The counter-measures adopted by the government have, 
however, 
worked to stabilize the market prices of grain and cooking oil, 
while the State Council is taking steps to control the prices of 
other commodities bureau officials said. 
  However, the taxes and profits generated by State firms 
listed in the government budget also doubled from December 1992 
to the last month of 1993. 
  State factories, which only experienced a 5.5 percent 
increase in output in November last year, had a year-on-year 
increase of 13.9 percent in output which totalled 174.9 billion 
yuan ($20.3 billion).

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Brake Put on Fake Truck Scam"] </F>
  [Text] Some 16,000 fake trucks are believed to be still on 
the roads today, following the discovery of 4,000 such vehicles 
recently in South China. 
  The discovery has prompted authorities to warn Chinese 
consumers again to be on the lookout for fake and shoddy goods. 
  Fabricated motors, mechanical equipment and high-tech 
products have joined the list of fake name brand liquors, 
cigarettes, medicine, fertilizers and pesticides. 
  According to Li Chuanqing, newly appointed Director General 
of the State Technology Supervision Administration (STSA), one 
of the most serious new cases involves fake Dong Feng trucks. 
  According to Li, more than 4,000 such fake trucks have been 
found on the roads. This has resulted in an estimated loss of 
40 million yuan ($4.59 million) to the State and also to the 
maker, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which is based in Hubei 
Province. 
  Analysts believe some 16,000 more fake trucks are in 
service, 
he added. 
  Meanwhile, some enterprises in Zhejiang's Pingyang County 
and 
Fujian's Fuding County have sold assembled mechanical equipment 
to landlocked regions at more than 60 million yuan ($6.89 
million). 
  When the machine tools arrived in these 26 provinces and 
municipalities under the name of "joint ventures," they failed 
to operate and turned out to be waste parts. 
  The central government is now investigating these matters 
and 
is prepared to levy tougher penalties on producers. 
  Counterfeit products in the high tech sector include 
computer 
software, anti-virus disks and laser symbol detectors. 
  Li vowed to further carry on the drive against counterfeit 
goods, which was started six years ago. 
  Last year, the country handled 91,017 cases involving fake 
and shoddy goods, sentenced 470 people and executed four. 
  One of the latest cases reported by the Beijing-based 
Worker's Daily [GONGREN RIBAO] said that a firm in Shenzhen was 
ordered to pay a fine of 8.2 million yuan ($940,000) and had its 
earnings of 2.8 million yuan ($320,000) confiscated for selling 
counterfeit Maotai, a Chinese brand liquor.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Gold Sales to State Dropped 40 per cent </F>
in 1993"] 
  [Text] The amount of gold sold to the government last year 
plunged by nearly 40 per cent over 1992. 
  This was the first time in the past 15 years that gold sales 
to the State decreased, said Cui Dewen, Vice Director of the 
Gold Bureau under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. 
  State regulations stipulate that all gold produced in the 
country must be sold to the People's Bank of China. 
  Although gold purchased by the central bank fell drastically 
last year gold output was higher than in 1992 said Ai Dacheng, 
also Vice- Director of the Gold Bureau. 
  A considerable amount of gold produced in the country was 
illegally sold on the black market at higher market prices, Cui 
and Ai said. 
  The central bank's purchase price for gold is roughly half 
the international market price. 
  During the first five months of last year, gold sales to the 
State fell 57 per cent over the same period of the previous year. 
  To reverse the trend, the government raised the purchase 
price from 1,697 yuan ($195) per ounce to 2,986 yuan ($343) last 
September. 
  The government pledged that the new purchase price, about 10 
per cent lower than price on the London gold market, will 
fluctuate with the London gold price. 
  In September, a record amount of gold was sold to the State. 
  But the price of gold has remained at 2,986 yuan ($343) per 
ounce since September 1, while the price in the London gold 
market has climbed from $375 to $390 per ounce. 
  The gap has attracted gold producers back to the black 
markets. 
  Cui attributed the problem to weak management of the gold 
industry. 
  Last year, the gold bureau went from being an independent 
unit under the State Council to a part of the Ministry of 
Metallurgical Industry. 
  With poor supervision, many individuals and units were able 
to illegally mine gold. 
  And Cui said he is not optimistic about the situation 
changing this year. 
  The country's gold producers will be the hardest hit by the 
new taxation system that took effect on January 1, he said.

  [Text] The Sichuan Three Gorges Joint Economic Development 
Committee held the first meeting in Chongqing on 14 and 15 
January. At this meeting, Provincial Deputy Party Secretary and 
Governor Xiao Yang stressed that the success of the Three Gorges 
project will depend on whether the 1 million residents in the 
reservoir area can be transferred out. Sichuan firmly supports 
the Three Gorges project and therefore must make this transfer 
successful. 
  Xiao Yang pointed out: We must properly relocate these 
residents so that they will work and live in contentment. In 
this respect, we must resolutely implement the policy of 
exploitative transfer so that the transfer of the residents will 
merge with economic and social development. 
  Vice Governor Gan Yuping systematically explained the basic 
situation in eastern Sichuan, its conditions for reclamation, 
and the policy for joint development. 
  The meeting listened to the opinions proposed by the 
committee on joint economic development in the Three Gorges 
area. Sun Tongchuan, member of the provincial party committee's 
Standing Committee and secretary of the Chongqing City CPC 
Committee, attended the meeting and made a speech. Mayors and 
commissioners from eight cities and prefectures in eastern 
Sichuan, including Chongqing City, Wanxian City, Nantong City, 
and Fuling Prefecture also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Yichang, January 25 (XINHUA) -- With the full 
support of the central government, Yichang City in Hubei 
Province, has stepped up the pace of construction of a 
communication network that serves the largest water conservancy 
and power project -- the Three Gorges. 
  Preparations for an international airport have started. 
According to a preliminary plan, the airport will be built in 
two phases. The first phase will involve the construction of a 
2,600- meter runway and the second phase will involved a 
3,200-meter runway. The first phase, estimated to cost 350 
million yuan, is scheduled for completion in 1995. 
  Work on a deep-water harbor capable of accommodating ships 
of 
3,000 tons is to start soon near the dam site. The project is 
expected to cost 120 million yuan. 
  With a designed handling capacity of 10 to 50 million tons 
annually, the port will be used to transport materials needed in 
the construction of the Three Gorges Project, of which 
preliminary projects have started. 
  Meanwhile, a highway bridge across the Chang Jiang River at 
Yichang will be built soon. 
  The Three Gorges Project, which was launched two years ago 
by 
the Chinese Government, is one of the world's largest water 
conservancy and power projects. A dam 185 meters high and 
nearly 2 km long will be thrown across the Chang Jiang River 
before the year 2010.

  [Text] Yichang, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Aid has come from 
all over the country to the Three Gorges Water Control Dam area 
to help the local people to emigrate from the area. 
  According to officials from the Migration Development Bureau 
of the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee under the 
State Council, during the past year, 20 provinces and 
municipalities and 60 central government departments have 
offered 133 million yuan in support of dam area activities. 
  The Three Gorges Water Control Dam is expected to take 17 
years to finish. As the project progresses, a large area along 
the Chang Jiang River will be flooded, including the sites of 
two cities, 11 counties, 114 towns and 1,711 villages. The 
people in the area will have to be moved out to free up land for 
the project's construction. 
  A span of over 600 kilometers from Yichang to Chongqing is 
to 
become the migration front. The migration work will be 
extremely arduous, an official from the bureau said. 
  The Chinese Government has instituted preferential policies 
to aid the economic development of the dam area and create a 
favorable environment for the migration work. 
  Support is offered through various means, such as technical 
assistance, capital investment, job training, information 
consultation and labor service export. 
  Beijing, Shanghai and some coastal cities and provinces have 
provided thousands of jobs for the migrants, and Shenzhen, a 
special economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, has 
allocated 500,000 yuan to train migration administrative 
personnel. 
  As residents of Yichang City in central China's Hubei 
Province should be moved out first to make room for the 
preparatory stage of the project, 50 million yuan of assistance 
has been rushed to the city from all over the country. 
  By the end of last year, more than 5,300 people have been 
relocated from the Three Gorges Dam area so as to clear over 
70,000 hectares for construction work. 
  The migration project has already started. At present, an 
area of more than 1,800 hectares has been cleared for project 
construction and 25 factories are now being moved.

  [Text] Guiyang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The carrying out of 
a poverty-relief program over the past decade has resulted in 40 
million people in China's impoverished mountainous regions 
emerging from poverty and much improved local public facilities. 
  A report by the State Planning Commission says that under 
the 
program some 6,800 km of roads and 7,855 bridges have been 
built, and 82,000 km of roads upgraded in nearly 10,000 villages 
in 18 impoverished regions in Shanxi, Shaanxi and other 
provinces. 
  The program also supplied pure water to 27.72 million people 
and 18 million heads of cattle, and increased the area of 
irrigated farmland by 2.23 million ha [hectares] and hydropower 
generating capacity by 330,000 kw, the report says. 
  The program, called "relief in exchange for work", differs 
from the traditional poverty-relief programs in that the help 
does not come in form of money, but in form of material input by 
the state or consumer goods in exchange for farmers' labor. 
  In this way, the report says, the government can save the 
cash it badly needs for construction while overstocked 
industrial products can find consumers. 
  Since 1984 the Chinese Government has put into the program 
20 
billion yuan-worth of grain, textiles, consumer electric 
products and household hardware. In return, farmers have put in 
hundreds of millions of labor/days. 
  The report says the program marks a change in the 
government's policy. Rather than providing aids in cash, the 
new policy aims to improve the infrastructure of the 
impoverished regions and implant the possibility of 
self-development. 
  In Guizhou Province in southwest China the past few years 
have witnessed the building of 7,200 km of roads and 525 bridges 
under the program. The report says Guizhou is the greatest 
benefiter of the program. 
  The province also gets one fifth of the one million tons of 
grain provided annually by the government to the ethnic-minority 
areas in the central and western parts of China. The grain is 
used to pay farmers working to make new terraced farmlands or to 
upgrade hilly land. 
  The report says some 76,000 ha of high-yield farmland has 
been created in the province over the past two years. It 
predicts that by the end of the century the province, now 
suffering from a serious grain shortage, will be able to produce 
enough grain to feed itself. 
  Since 1991, when massive floods caused tremendous losses to 
east China, the government has launched a program to repair and 
build water-conservancy projects on seven rivers and five lakes 
in the region. 
  The projects, involving 10 billion yuan-worth of industrial 
products in exchange for farmers' labor, will be completed by 
1995. 
  The report says that the construction materials and tools 
are 
usually provided by local governments. 
  The report says China's poverty-relief program is highly 
appreciated by international organizations including the World 
Bank, which depicts the program in a report as good way to 
create job opportunities in impoverished areas and to build 
rural infrastructure facilities. 
  The report disclosed that, starting this year, the 
government 
will launch a new program codenamed the "87 Poverty Relief 
Project", so-called as it will strive to pull 80 million people 
from the poverty line over seven years. The project will 
require the input of two billion yuan-worth of industrial 
products a year.

  [Text] Nanning, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Total output value 
of rural enterprises in five northwest provinces and regions in 
1993 increased by 45 percent over that in 1992, local government 
officials said. 
  The output value of rural enterprises in 1992 was 30 percent 
up over the previous year in Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai 
Provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Ningxia 
Hui Autonomous Region in Northwest China. 
  For the impoverished minority nationality regions, township 
enterprises have become essential to economic development in 
rural areas, the officials say. 
  Meanwhile, for three consecutive years between 1991 and 
1993, 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Central West China had been 
leading the country in the growth of township enterprises. Last 
year, their total output value hit 60.1 billion yuan, or 2.15 
times that of the previous year. 
  To shorten the discrepancy with other economically developed 
areas of the country, these regions have been putting more 
investments into rural enterprises. 
  In Shaanxi Province, some enterprises have begun to attract 
foreign funds. In the first half of last year, foreign 
investors set up more than 50 joint ventures with local township 
enterprises involving a total investment of 600 million yuan. 
  The share-holding system is taking root in such enterprises. 
Gansu Province now has some 10,000 share-holding township 
enterprises, while share-holding township enterprises in Shaanxi 
Province account for ten percent of the total. 
  At the same time, new and high technology is playing an 
increasing more important role. Many of the rural enterprises 
are upgrading their technology and readjusting products mix. A 
number of large-scale and modern township enterprises are taking 
shape.

<F P=106> [Article by Huang Zhiling from the "Opinion" page: "Farmers </F>
Need State Aid"] 
  [Text] Since China started its market oriented rural 
reform 15 years ago, its farmers have had more say in production 
and sales. 
  But government help is needed to further adapt them to the 
market economy, economists say. 
  A recent survey conducted by the Fixed Rural Observation 
Post 
Office (Fropo) under the Agricultural Ministry confirms this 
view. 
  China set up fixed observation posts 10 years ago in 312 
villages. 
  "The posts aim at collecting firsthand information for 
decision- makers drafting rural policies," said Fropo director 
Yu Zhan, the survey creator and one of the analyzers of the 
report. 
  Fropo's survey covered 7,012 rural households in the 312 
villages. All the questionnaires were filled out and returned. 
  The survey found 58 percent of Chinese farmers have more 
decision-making power, allowing them to decide what crops to 
plant, how many and how to plant. 
  Before the implementation of rural reform, the State told 
farmers what to plant. It was the sole supplier of production 
materials and monopolized the purchase of farm products. 
  Thirty-three per cent of the respondents said they have full 
autonomy over the sales of their crops after fulfilling the 
State quotas on grain and cotton purchases. 
  And farmers now buy most of their production materials from 
the market, according to the survey. 
  In 1992, the average rural household spent 756 yuan ($87) on 
production materials and 90 percent of the cash was spent in the 
market. 
  The survey also found 61 percent of the households in favour 
of diversified channels to get farm production materials. They 
said that it would lower prices, increase product variety and 
force State dealers to improve service. 
  In addition, the survey found that farmers have more 
channels 
to get production funds, instead of taking out loans from banks 
and credit cooperatives alone. 
  In 1992, the average household borrowed 423 yuan ($49) for 
production accounting for 21 percent of the cash needed. Of 
that total, 185 yuan ($21), or 44 per cent of the money, came 
from banks and credit co-operatives, and the rest came from 
individual lenders. 
  The survey shows that households engaged solely in farming 
borrowed the least. Their borrowings accounted for only 16 per 
cent of the cash they needed in annual farm production. 
  Households which owned land but did not engage in farm 
production borrowed the most. Their borrowings accounted for 38 
percent of the cash they needed in their annual production. 
Unlike other households they also paid interest to the lenders. 
  They usually lease the land to other farmers and start 
private businesses of their own, in their hometowns or in urban 
areas. 
  "The finding reveals that the appearance of non-agricultural 
sectors has boosted fund circulation in the countryside and that 
a rural financial market is emerging," Yu said. 
  Before the rural reform, farmers were not allowed to leave 
the land to look for jobs elsewhere. But in recent years, an 
increasing number of farmers are migrating from underdeveloped 
regions to developed areas. 
  "Because China has more people and less arable land, it's 
necessary for surplus farmers to shift to non-agricultural 
industries or where they're needed. And rural-urban migration 
may result in the formation of a rural labour market," said Zhao. 
  But farmers are not all accustomed to the market economy, 
partly because of poor government guidance and service. 
  According to the survey, in 1992, 13.8 per cent of the 
decision- makers in rural households were still illiterates, 
41.5 per cent were elementary school graduates, 34.5 per cent 
were junior high school graduates and 10 per cent were senior 
high school graduates. Only 3.9 per cent of them received 
vocational training. 
  Poor education and the deep-rooted influence of the planned 
economy cause many farmers to respond slowly to the market 
economy. 
  To help farmers enter the market, the government has to 
offer 
farmers timely, accurate information and to establish more 
markets for farm products. 
  The survey shows that information is what farmers need most 
in the current market economy. 
  "They do not know what may sell well on the market. This 
often leads to stockpiles," said Yu. 
  According to the survey, in 1992, 38 per cent of crude 
drugs, 
36 per cent of oranges, 30 per cent of hemp, 17 per cent of 
timber, 15 per cent of oil bearing crops and 13 per cent of corn 
production were stockpiled because of the information shortage. 
  Because of backward transportation, inadequate warehouses 
and 
poor processing skills, many farmers have to sell their products 
cheap locally. 
  Three hundred and six households which specialized in 
transporting farm produce to other regions for sales complained 
about too many roadblocks and wanton charges.

  [Text] Beijing, January 22 (XINHUA) -- The household- and 
initiative-based rural responsibility system has pushed up 
China's grain production substantially. Last year, China's 
grain output topped 456 million tons, according to today's 
PEOPLE'S DAILY. 
  Under a responsibility system which ties farmers' earnings 
to 
production, the country's grain harvest surpassed the 400 
million ton mark in 1984, with per-capita output of grain 
approaching 400 kilograms for the first time, the paper said. 
  "Since 1984 market supply and demand has been in near 
balance, without steep ups or downs," the paper said. 
  Even in 1991, which witnessed severe floodings in eastern 
China, grain prices remained stable, it added. 
  While ensuring grain production, farmers now pay close 
attention to the grain quality. As a result, the ratio of 
quality rice and wheat to total grain output has risen markedly, 
the paper said. 
  Counties with per-hectare grain production exceeding 15 tons 
have appeared not only in South China, but also in Shandong, 
Henan and other provinces in North China. 
  "We still need to redouble our efforts to attain the goal 
for 
harvesting 500 million tons a year by the end of the century," 
the paper said. 
  It expressed the belief that correct government policies and 
effective measures will enable Chinese farmers to turn out more 
grain on limited croplands.

<F P=106> [By Gilles Campion] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Jan 25 (AFP) - Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrei Kozyrev was due to arrive here Wednesday for high-level 
talks with Chinese leaders about bi-lateral political and 
military cooperation and Russia's changing situation, Russian 
and diplomatic sources said. 
  Kozyrev, who last visited China in December 1992 with 
President Boris Yeltsin, is due to spend 48 hours in Beijing 
before taking a brief trip to the Shenzhen special economic zone 
near Hong Kong and visiting the ancient central capital of Xian, 
the home of the terra cotta warriors. 
  During his meetings in the capital, the minister is due to 
discuss the upcoming visit to Moscow of Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin, which is scheduled some time within the next six months, 
the Russian sources said. Kozyrev is due to meet Jiang and 
Prime Minister Li Peng on Friday. He is also due, along with 
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen, to sign an accord setting 
up regular consultations between the two, the Russian Embassy 
here said. A second accord due to be signed concerns border 
crossings for traders, the Russian sources said. 
  In 1992, Russian-Chinese trade amounted to six billion 
dollars, 80 percent of which passed through their common, 4,500 
kilometer (2,790 mile) border. Two-thirds of trade is based on 
barter. 
  "Sino-Russian relations are very good and have been steadily 
growing," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said 
last week. 
  Chinese officials closely follow the situation inside 
Russia, 
and the matter will be one of the primary topics of discussion 
during Kozyrev's visit. After the Sino-Soviet rift that 
developed in the beginning of the 1960s, the two communist 
giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China by 
Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Boris Yeltsin came to power in 1991, 
the neighboring countries have enjoyed strong military 
cooperation. A Russian diplomatic source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the military issue would be on the agenda and 
that the minister "is capable of broaching all issues." 
  The Chinese leaders will most likely ask for an explanation 
about the delay in delivering Russian Sukhoi-27 jets, other 
Russian sources said. The Chinese air force ordered 24 such 
jets worth more than a billion dollars in 1992, but only a dozen 
of them have been delivered so far. The military hardware 
factory in Komsomolsk, in far eastern Russia, is suffering from 
a shortage of spare parts, the sources said. 
  During his visit, Yetsin spoke of the great prospects for 
Sino- Russian military cooperation, recalling that much of 
China's technology and equipment came from the former Soviet 
Union, and thus that China needs Russia's spare parts and 
technological assistance. Russia constructed 256 arms 
manufacturing plants in China following a 1950 alliance treaty. 
  In November 1993, the Russian defense minister Pavel 
Gratchev 
signed a five-year military cooperation accord with his 
counterpart Chi Haotian. The Chinese army prefers 
less-expensive Russian material to Western equipment because of 
its price. According to Western military experts, China wants 
to buy fighter planes, particularly MiG-31s, ground-to-air 
missiles, and technology for missiles, tanks, radar and 
in-flight refuelling. 
  The issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region, which was 
broached during Gratchev's visit, will also figure prominently 
on the agenda of Kozyrev's discussions in China, the Russian 
sources said.

  [Text] Moscow, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today ordered Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
to nominate four deputy prime ministers within one week. 
  A presidential order said today that the Russian Government, 
or the Federal Executive Power Institution, will have four 
deputy prime ministers, including two first deputy prime 
ministers. 
  The new government will have 23 ministries and seven other 
state commissions and federal bureaus, including the Federal 
Broadcasting and Television Bureau. 
  Yeltsin had earlier asked Chernomyrdin to present a plan on 
government reshuffle before January 6, for discussions in the 
new parliament when it opens tomorrow. 
  But Chernomyrdin failed to do so because of differences 
among 
the cabinet members over the set-up of the new government. 
  Therefore Yeltsin decided to take on the task by himself. 
  The present Russian Government has nine deputy prime 
ministers, including three first deputy prime ministers.

  [Text] Moscow, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today that the "market 
romanticism" was over, but denied allegations that the 
government will withdraw from its market-oriented economic 
reform completely. 
  At a news conference, Chernomyrdin said the government will 
only make certain changes in the tactics of reforms, which mean 
a switch from purely monetarist methods pursued by Yegor Gaydar 
in managing the economy. 
  However, the cabinet chief pointed out, his government will 
concentrate on boosting production by any means. 
  "The period of market romanticism is over now, but we will 
not permit its substitution by an obsession with production," 
the prime minister said. 
  He rejected rumors about the changes of the strategic course 
of the economic reform currently underway in the country, 
noting, "I state with all responsibility that this is not so." 
  Yeltsin's program towards a deep transformation of Russian 
society "was, is and will be carried through," Chernomyrdin said. 
  But, he added, "We plan to correct the methods of reform." 
It means a switch from purely monetarist policies to other 
measures tested in many European countries, he explained. 
  These measures envisage the creation of true competition on 
the Russian market and in the economy between Russia and foreign 
producers. This signals "a big opening of the Russian economy 
to the world economy," the prime minister added. 
  At the news conference, Chernomyrdin also announced the line 
up of his new government, saying that deputy prime ministers 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays and Yuriy Yarov will 
retain their current posts. He also announced that Oleg 
Soskovets will remain as first deputy. 
  Under an order signed by President Boris Yeltsin in January, 
the number of deputy prime ministers will be cut from nine to 
four or five. 
  In the new government, Aleksandr Shokhin becomes economics 
minister, Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, while 
Sergey Shakhray will head the ministry of nationalities and 
regional policy. 
  Boris Fedorov was offered the post of the finance minister, 
but "he has not yet responded," Chernomyrdin told reporters.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Ivan Rybkin, a 
47-year-old engineer and a member of the Russian Agrarian Party, 
today was elected speaker of the Russian lower house, or State 
Duma. 
  Rybkin won 223 votes from the 416 members of the State Duma 
in this morning's voting. Twenty-eight members abstained. 
  Rybkin told the press that he would try to cooperate with 
the 
president and the government according to the Constitution, and 
set up a "partner's relationship" with the upper house, or 
Federation Council. 
  He said he would also work hard to maintain coordination 
among all members and groups of the lower house by taking into 
account the interests of all, including the smaller contingents. 
  Rybkin, who holds a degree in engineering, was once a 
Communist Party secretary in a Volgagrad District. He was 
elected people's deputy in the Russia Federation Parliament of 
the former Soviet Union, and had been the leader of the Russian 
Communist Party parliamentary group in the Russia Federation. 
  He later became a member of the Russian Agrarian Party, 
which 
nominated him for parliament following the legislative election 
last December.

  [Text] Moscow, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev reiterated here today that Russia must 
maintain its military existence in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) and the Baltic nations to protect 
Russia's interests. 
  Russia's interests in these areas are "critically 
important," 
Kozyrev told a Foreign Ministry meeting on Tuesday. "The major 
threats against Russia also come from there," he added. 
  Kozyrev strongly opposed any attempt to withdraw Russia's 
military presence in these areas, describing it as "extremist 
attitude." 
  One of Russia's policy priorities in these countries is to 
solve the issue of dual citizenships for Russian residents 
there, he said. 
  He said Russia should improve the efficiency of its 
cooperation with other CIS members and the Baltic nations and 
work out short, medium and long-term strategies in setting up an 
economic union with them.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Ci Ruling (1964 3067 1545): "After the </F>
Signing of the Russia-U.S.-Ukraine Nuclear Agreement"] 
  [Text] Leaders of three countries -- Russia, the United 
States, and Ukraine -- signed an agreement in Moscow on 14 
January on dismantling 176 strategic nuclear weapons and 1,500 
nuclear warheads in the Ukrainian territory and carrying all of 
them to Russia to be destroyed. In exchange for this, Ukraine 
will be financially compensated with aid of $175 million from 
the United States and at the same time will be given a safety 
guarantee. This is a major action that has been jointly 
undertaken by Russia, the United States, and Ukraine concerning 
the issue of nuclear weapons since the Lisbon Accord signed 
between the United States and Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and 
Belarus in May 1992. 
  All three parties have made positive assessment of the above 
agreement. Clinton said that it was a "breakthrough" which has 
reduced the possibility of nuclear calamities and has ushered in 
a "new era" in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship. Yeltsin 
maintained that the agreement had intensified the nuclear 
nonproliferation mechanism and pushed forward the process of 
nuclear disarmament. Kravchuk said that the agreement was the 
result of compromise made by all parties, which enabled Ukraine 
to be more secure and obtain the right of equal partnership. 
  No doubt, the Moscow agreement has made significant progress 
toward solving the nuclear weaponry problem in Ukraine, but many 
problems have yet to be resolved. Moreover, whether the 
agreement can be smoothly carried out will depend on the 
development of Ukraine's domestic political situation and the 
relations between Ukraine and Russia and between Ukraine and the 
United States. 
  First, the issue of nuclear weapons has a decisive impact on 
the stability of Ukraine's political situation. When Ukraine 
proclaimed its independence, it declared that it would be a 
nuclear-free country and promised to destroy all its nuclear 
weapons. Over the past few years, however, there have been 
different political propositions at home regarding the approval 
of the treaty to reduce strategic weapons in the first stage and 
the accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. In some 
people's opinion, under the circumstances of enormous external 
pressure and public territorial claims from certain Russian 
forces, nuclear weaponry is Ukraine's "trump card" in defending 
its national independence and territorial integrity. They were 
even more worried about Russia's foreign policy after its new 
parliamentary election. Therefore, they do not want to give up 
their nuclear weapons but favor retaining them, at least for a 
certain period. Other people are of the opinion that the 
principle of becoming a nuclear-free country should not be 
changed, but they should be compensated for giving away the 
nuclear weapons, or the contents of the nuclear warheads should 
be transformed into fuel for nuclear power stations to alleviate 
the serious energy crisis. In addition, Ukraine found it 
difficult to continue maintaining and managing the existing 
nuclear missiles either economically or technically. If the 
nuclear arsenal is preserved, several dozen billion U.S. dollars 
will still be needed to set up a complete system of scientific 
research and production. That will be beyond their ability, 
even though they wish to do so. For this reason, the Ukrainian 
parliament decided last year to approve the treaty with 13 
conditions attached to it and called for the nuclear powers, 
primarily Russia and the United States, to provide a security 
guarantee and economic aid as compensation. Therefore, after 
President Kravchuk signed the treaty in Moscow, he still has to 
make painstaking efforts to persuade the parliament so that the 
treaty can be endorsed and put into effect. 
  Second, the issue of nuclear weapons is a vital element that 
has an impact on the relations between Ukraine and Russia and 
between Ukraine and the United States. Since the disintegration 
of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons have all along been one of 
the major disagreements between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian 
side maintains that it should be the only successor of the 
Soviet nuclear weapons, and that those in the Ukrainian 
territory must be shipped to Russia. What is more, Russia tried 
to force Ukraine to give in by suspending supplies of petroleum 
and natural gas to the latter and pressing it to repay its 
debts. As for the United States, it first tried to make Ukraine 
submit to its pressure, threatening that, if Ukraine would not 
settle the nuclear problem, it would not develop other aspects 
of its relations with Ukraine. Later, it changed tactics by 
promising to provide Ukraine with aid of $175 million and 
increasing personnel contacts and consultations with a view to 
urging Ukraine to hand over its nuclear weapons. As a matter of 
fact, what Russia and the United States are worried about is the 
emergence of another powerful and independent nuclear country, 
apart from Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
Hence, they insisted that they would not provide a security 
guarantee to Ukraine unless it acceded to the treaty. Prior to 
his current trip to Moscow, Clinton was the first to announce in 
Brussels that Ukraine had consented to destroy the nuclear 
weapons. He also made a short stay in Kiev, which was aimed at 
demonstrating the progress made in nuclear disarmament so as to 
remove the anxieties of Europe over the nuclear threats on the 
one hand, and at manifesting the support he had won from NATO 
members on the other. 
  The public maintains that the solution of the problem 
regarding Ukraine's nuclear weapons is a major achievement that 
has been scored through the coordinated position between the 
United States and Russia. However, the principal purpose of 
Clinton's current trip was to put his plan of a "partnership for 
peace" into practice. He made no commitment to security in the 
Eastern European region, and his promise of economic aid to 
Ukraine was also much said but little done, which was far from 
what Ukraine had expected. Judging from this, the changes of 
political situation in Russia and the United States and whether 
their policies toward Ukraine as well as the U.S. undertaking of 
aid and compensation can be carried out will have an impact on 
whether Ukraine will perform its obligations in a period of time 
to come.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Zhang Qihua (1728 0796 6478): "NATO's New </F>
Strategy and Europe's Security"] 
  [Text] In the wake of the NATO summit and President 
Clinton's visit to Prague and Moscow, a program of "partnership 
for peace" through "careful consideration" was eventually 
presented. A universal view in the West is that this program 
has been set out as NATO's new strategy, which aims at dealing 
with the new challenges facing European security in the wake of 
the Cold War. 
  The so-called new strategy is that NATO will establish 
peaceful bilateral relations with partnership countries to 
gradually expand NATO to the eastern part of Europe, thus 
establishing a new European security system with NATO as its 
core. 
  This new strategy has been developed on the basis of the two 
previous NATO summits that determined changes in military 
strategy and expanding dialogue and realms of cooperation; it 
involves NATO's role and all aspects of the new structure of 
European security under the new situation. Viewing the summit 
communique and President Clinton's speech, the main contents 
include the following: 
  1. The United States is determined to play a new leading 
role in a historic turning point for NATO to revitalize the 
organization; 
  2. NATO's gate will be open to East Europe, the CIS, and 
other West European countries; NATO will decide whether or not 
to accept their membership depending on military conditions and 
political cooperation between the two sides; 
  3. As a means of military intervention, it will organize and 
establish a multinational joint task force comprising NATO and 
non-NATO member countries; this task force will be under the 
command of the Western European Union, with access to NATO's 
communications, equipment, and logistics forces; 
  4. Under the conditions of a termination of the "common 
enemy," NATO's chief target is to deal with "common dangers," 
and presently the emphasis is being laid on dealing with 
existing border and ethnic contradictions and the conflicts 
arising therein, such as the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and 
  5. NATO is to accelerate its conversion from a military- 
political organization to a political-military organization so 
that it can safeguard European security and stability more 
effectively. 
  To promote NATO's new strategy, the United States has 
presented a new attitude of improving relations with closer ties 
to its European allies. President Clinton called for joint 
U.S.-European efforts to restructure European security, and said 
that the United States would continue to carry out its 
obligations in Europe. Clinton pledged before the leaders of 
the 15 member countries that his administration would be 
different from that of his predecessor and that he "will support 
European efforts to promote its own security and interests." 
The United States wants to exercise leadership over NATO, but 
is unwilling to get too involved in European conflicts; it can 
openly allow Europe to "play a greater role," with its European 
allies taking a greater responsibility for defense. Another 
cause in which the United States finds the assistance of its 
European allies indispensable is if it wants to "merge" East 
European countries with the West; everyone knows that some East 
European countries have long expressed the hope to join NATO. 
Viewing actual conditions, Western Europe also has aspirations 
to strengthen security, but its unity on defense remains quite 
fragile. On the security issue, Europe will have to continue to 
rely on the United States. The strongest voice for U.S. 
assistance to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina came from 
France, which has always advocated independent defense; this 
serves as a very good example. 
  The prerequisites for expanding NATO and realizing European 
security are U.S.-European solidarity and cooperation. However, 
viewing the present situation, the United States needs to handle 
well its relations with Russia. Some people believe that the 
most significant symbol of President Clinton's European trip was 
the U.S.-Russian summit. Those observers who show concern for 
NATO, whether in favor or not of NATO pushing eastward, 
"consider Moscow with anxiety." Those who are in favor of this 
worry that they will be labeled as "opposing" Moscow, and those 
who oppose it are not without misgivings about "isolating" 
Moscow. It was by no means accidental that the United States 
did not dare to present a list of countries included in a plan 
to push NATO eastward. Clinton had to go to Prague to remove 
some of the leading contenders misgivings; more importantly, he 
had to go to Moscow personally to weigh the pros and cons of the 
issue. Two points of major U.S. concern are, namely, first, 
whether or not Russia's political stability and economic reform 
are on the right track; and second, what is really in Yeltsin's 
mind about the expansion of NATO, and whether or not Russia 
insists on possessing a "particular position" and "leadership" 
in security arrangements involving Eastern Europe and within the 
CIS. 
  In Moscow, Clinton stated that he would continue to support 
Yeltsin, and, giving much food for thought, the two sides 
announced that no new dividing line should be drawn in Europe. 
It seems that this proves the fact that in pushing NATO's new 
strategy, the United States has continued to adopt the cautious 
policy of giving "priority to Moscow." Although the United 
States has repeatedly stated that East European security and 
U.S.-European interests are linked as one, and that it is ready 
to implement the "partnership for peace" program, nevertheless, 
all this cannot affect U.S.-Russian relations. It seems that it 
will not be easy for the United States to realize NATO's new 
strategy. Let alone the Russian factor, viewing the West, we 
find that it will be very difficult to unify the differences 
which exist in understanding between the United States and 
Europe and within Western Europe. As for Eastern Europe and the 
CIS states, their reaction to NATO's new strategy has been 
different. Under such circumstances, it is still hard to tell 
what the bottom line is in pushing NATO eastward, which country 
will be the first to be absorbed, what the effects and results 
will be, and what a future European security structure will look 
like. In commenting on the results of the current summit, 
REUTER said: "The problems caused by NATO's role in Eastern 
Europe and other regions will be more numerous and more 
serious." That is not an exaggeration.

"Changing From Across-the-Board Shock to In-Depth Unrest -- 
Prospects for the International Situation in 1994"] 
  [Text] In 1994 the world steps into the third year after 
the end of the Cold War, and the international situation will 
continue to develop and change inside the general framework of 
the world pattern in the transitional period. The multipolar 
tendency will become more obvious. The shock wave caused by the 
end of the Cold War on the world situation will change from 
across-the-board shock in 1993 to in-depth shock in 1994. The 
general changes in the international situation will tend to be 
less violent, but local and regional turbulences will still 
continue. 
  The contention for domination of affairs in the 
Asia-Pacific region will develop further. The multitiered 
economic cooperation in this region will continue mainly in the 
form of subregional cooperation [yi ci qu yu he zuo wei zhu 0110 
2945 0575 1008 0678 0155 3634 0031], and the multilateral 
dialogue mechanism in Northeast Asia will become the new focus 
of regional security cooperation. 
  After the Seattle meeting, the United States tried to 
further 
expand the functions of APEC, and further its effort to 
establish the Asia-Pacific Economic Community advocated by the 
United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Although 
Japan did not object to the relevant proposals raised by the 
United States, it set forth certain reservations and limitations 
on the U.S. proposals and also covertly encouraged and supported 
ASEAN in confronting the United States on this issue. The ASEAN 
countries were opposed to the U.S.- dominated plan for 
Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation. After Indonesia took 
over the APEC chairmanship, it joined other ASEAN countries in 
using this advantage to slow down the pace of Asia-Pacific 
economic cooperation advocated by the United States. 
  After the Seattle meeting, although economic cooperation in 
the Pan-Asia-Pacific region was strengthened somewhat, the APEC 
ministerial meeting in Seattle did not reach agreement on the 
final development goal and evolution pace of APEC. Moreover, 
various parties concerned were involved in sharp contradictions 
on this issue. Therefore, the Asia-Pacific regional economic 
cooperation will not advance too fast in 1994, and the 
subregional and "enlarged tripartite" [zeng zhang san jiao she 
1073 7022 0005 6037 1709] economic cooperation in the 
Asia-Pacific region, especially in East Asia, will come to 
another upsurge. 
  After the security forum in the ASEAN region was set in 
motion, the United States, Japan, and Russia will gradually 
shift the focus of their work to the Northeast Asian security 
affairs that have close relations with their own interests. It 
is expected that the United States, Japan, and Russia will 
strengthen their tripartite "semiofficial security forum" on 
affairs in Northeast Asia, and will make an effort to create 
their official dialogue mechanism. At the same time, the United 
States, Japan, and the ROK will also gradually open the secret 
consultation organization for the security in Northeast Asia 
formed by the United States, Japan, the ROK, Canada, and 
Australia, and will consider including China and Russia as 
members in order to exchange opinions on security affairs in 
this region. Northeast Asia will thus become another focus of 
the Asia-Pacific multilateral security dialogue. 
  The scope of contradictions between the United States, 
Japan, and Europe will become wider, but the focus of their 
frictions will shift. European and Asian affairs will be more 
closely linked in Western relations. 
  In the economic field, after the end of the Uruguay Round 
trade talks, the contradictions between the United States, 
Europe, and Japan will shift to the concrete implementation of 
the agreement. This year, the U.S., European, and Japanese 
Governments will still be plagued by their domestic problems, 
and may adopt more protectionist measures under domestic 
pressure. 
  In the political and security fields, in January, U.S. 
President Clinton will promote his "New Atlantic Doctrine" 
during his visit to Europe. The United States will try to 
maintain its domination over European political and security 
affairs and try to make NATO carry out adjustments and reforms 
according to its wishes. This will inevitably arouse vigilance 
and resentment among some West European countries. NATO's 
reorganization will become the main subject of the U.S.-European 
dispute. The U.S.-Japanese contradictions will become more 
prominent in the course of establishing the Asia-Pacific 
multilateral security mechanism. 
  A noteworthy fact is that the United States, Europe, and 
Japan are all stressing the implementation of their new 
Asia-Pacific policy in an attempt to expand their own influence 
in the Asia-Pacific region and to raise their status in the 
West. That is, they are trying to boost their influence in 
Europe and America through first boosting their influence in 
Asia. 
  Improving the Cooperative Mechanisms in Each's Own 
Region Will Remain the Task of Primary Importance of the Three 
Major Economic Circles of Europe, the United States, and 
Japan. 
  Improving and developing their internal cooperation 
mechanisms, and properly handling the contradictions and 
problems inside their own regions will be the most pressing and 
also the most important task for regional economic circles in 
1994. Before this task is successfully fulfilled, it is hard to 
carry out large-scale and intense inter-regional economic 
frictions and struggles. Although the Maastricht Treaty has 
come into force, it is hard to say whether the second-phase goal 
of the European Economic and Currency Union will be smoothly 
achieved. There remain serious differences between various EC 
countries on the economic policies. The struggle between 
unionism and the idea of safeguarding national sovereignty will 
become more profound and more intense in the process of 
integration. The general economic recession will make it hard 
for most EC members to meet the third-phase requirements of the 
economic and currency union on time. The North American Free 
Trade Agreement is also facing the fact that a distinct gap 
exists between the economies of the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico, so it is hard to unify the specific standards. In 
addition, many domestic factors in the United States and Mexico 
are also constraining the union from extending into Latin 
American. It is also hard to advance economic cooperation in 
the Pan-Asia-Pacific region at a faster pace because of the 
unevenness of economic development, the differences in social 
systems, and the existence of complex contradictions inside this 
region and also because the organizational structure of regional 
economic cooperation is rather loose. 
  Russia will remain the world's largest unstable factor, 
and the political struggle in Russia will continue. 
  Although Russia's new constitution has been passed and the 
new parliament has been elected, the Russian political situation 
will remain uncertain and the political struggle inside the 
ruling clique of Russia may become more intense. At present, 
various political factions are involved in another round of 
trial of strength around the cabinet appointments and the 
chairmanship of the two parliamentary chambers. In the first 
half of this year, the debate on whether to hold a presidential 
election will arise again. The tendency toward autonomy and 
self-determination in the 88 federal entities will make it hard 
to compromise with the national authorities. More importantly, 
the Russian economy is far from moving onto a path of normal 
development. It is even harder for the new parliament and the 
new cabinet to reach a conclusion on the new reform program. 
The authorities' macroeconomic policy will continue to be 
uncertain and elusive and the microeconomic entities will find 
it hard to take a firm course. The overall economic situation 
in Russia will not make a marked turn for the better. 
  In addition, big-power nationalism's further rise in Russia 
has aroused vigilance among some Western, East European, and 
former Soviet countries. The Russia policy of the Western 
countries, especially that of the United States, will be 
continuously adjusted according to changes in the Russian 
political situation. The changing Russian political situation 
will remain the most important variable that affects the 
development of the world pattern. 
  Many local hot spots will be settled in a political 
way, but many difficulties will remain. In some regions, local 
conflicts may arise again. 
  After the signing of the framework agreement on the 
Palestinian-Israeli Peace Treaty, the Middle East peace talks 
may make further breakthroughs. The dialogue between the 
Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge is still continuing. 
After the adoption of the interim constitution in South Africa, 
nationwide general elections will be held. The parties involved 
in the Bosnia civil war may reach a cease-fire agreement. 
However, the contradictions in all such old hot spots are 
complicated, and the peace processes will not be smooth. The 
frictions and conflicts in some new hot spots of the former 
Soviet region and Eastern Europe have not been alleviated, and 
may even further escalate.

"The World Has Not Given Up a Historic Opportunity"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec (XINHUA) -- After seven years, the 
Uruquay Round of multilateral trade talks finally concluded on 
15 December in Geneva when Sutherland, director general of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], banged the table 
with a gavel. The talks reached a comprehensive agreement which 
will further unclog the channel of world trade and create 
favorable conditions for the development of world trade and 
economy in the late 20th century and early 21st century. 
  The world economy has been in a recession since the late 
1980's. Under such a situation, all countries have adopted 
various measures to revive their economy, but without any 
remarkable success. So, to strive for success in the Uruguay 
Round of talks has been regarded as the only chance for getting 
the world economy out of stagnation. Since the GATT became 
effective in 1948, seven rounds of talks have been held, tariffs 
have dropped drastically, and the world's trade volume has risen 
from $57 billion in 1945 to $3.7 trillion in 1992. The GATT 
played a valuable role as an impetus to economic development 
which should not be overlooked. 
  The vast number of developing countries, considering the 
interests of the whole, have made relevant concessions and 
greatly contributed to the success of the recent round of talks. 
However, the Western powers nearly ruined such a historic 
opportunity despite the fact that they would benefit the most 
from the success of the talks. The Uruguay Round of talks was 
originally scheduled to end three years ago, but the talks were 
repeatedly delayed due to sharp differences between the European 
nations and the United States over such issues as trade in 
agricultural products, financial services, subsidies to aircraft 
manufacturers, and trade in audio and visual products; and at 
times the talks almost reached a breaking point. Many people 
with breadth of vision warned that the failure of the talks 
would inevitably lead to intensified protectionism and 
consequences worse than anything imaginable. After repeated 
bargaining back and forth, the European side and the U.S. side 
at last had to make compromises. 
  The Uruguay Round of talks had 117 participating parties and 
dealt with 21 items, including market access, tariff reduction, 
service trade, and intellectual property. The text of the final 
agreement reached by the talks is as long as 450 pages, 
containing 45 independent documents. The major achievements are 
as follows: First, the problem of market access for almost all 
industrial and agricultural products has been solved. All 
non-tariff barriers which various countries have set up over the 
years to protect their industry and agriculture will be 
gradually removed in next 10 years. Second, tariffs for 
industrial goods will be drastically reduced, by approximately 
40 percent. Third, developed countries will reduce tariffs for 
agricultural products by 36 percent in six years, while 
developing nations will reduce the tariffs by 24 percent in 10 
years; and farm subsidies will be reduced by 36 percent in six 
years, and the export of subsidized farm products will be 
reduced by 21 percent. Fourth, banking, telecommunications, and 
other services, as well as intellectual property, will be placed 
for the first time under the control of the GATT. In addition, 
the agreement also deals with the establishment of multilateral 
trade organizations. 
  The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks is a 
welcome event for all countries. As Sutherland has said, the 
agreement means "more trade, more investment, more employment, 
and better income" for everyone. All parties, both developed 
countries and developing countries, will benefit to varying 
degrees. Of course, countries with more developed commodity 
economies and greater exports will benefit more. For this 
reason, developed countries will benefit much more than 
developing countries. According to calculations by several 
international organizations, after the agreement is completely 
carried out in 2005, the benefits obtained by all countries will 
range from $230 billion to $270 billion, and the actual benefits 
may even be much higher than these figures. According to an 
estimate by U.S. President Clinton, the United States alone will 
obtain benefits ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion and 
create several hundred thousand jobs. The indirect impact of 
the agreement will not be felt until after it is carried out, 
and it is too early to estimate what will happen now. 
  For the developed countries, the advantages from the 
agreement are evident, while to the vast number of developing 
countries, there could be more disadvantages than advantages. 
However, some developing countries which are achieving 
industrialization will benefit more from the agreement. First, 
these countries will be able to freely export their industrial 
products to developed countries. Next, these countries, with a 
good investment environment in which the production costs are 
much lower than in developed countries, will attract a great 
deal of investment from major transnational companies. The 
major disadvantages are as follows: First, although the 
agreement permits the poorest developing nations with no 
industrial foundation to adopt measures to protect their 
national industries, it is in fact not easy for them to do so. 
This is because if they adopt high tariffs, their people will 
be unable to afford to imported industrial goods; and if they 
adopt low tariffs, their national industries will be strangled. 
Second, the agreement has not solved the problem of high tariffs 
for textile goods, leather products, tropical products, and 
primary products, while these products are major export products 
of many developing countries. In particular, textile goods will 
continue to be subject to the control of the 1974 agreement on 
various fiber products in the next 10 years. The 1974 agreement 
is very unfavorable to developing countries because it sets 
quotas and high tariffs for imported textile goods. Third, when 
service trades such as banking and telecommunications enter 
developing countries, they could cause unexpected consequences. 
  Many international organizations have calculated the 
advantages and disadvantages of the agreement of the Uruguay 
Round of talks to developing countries. Their consensus is that 
the poorest countries, particularly black African nations south 
of the Sahara, will get only the smallest piece of the Uruguay 
Round cake. A serious defect of the Uruguay Round agreement is 
that it has not paid due attention to the commodity production 
and trade of the poorest countries. 
  An agreement is merely an agreement, and the key is how to 
carry it out. Some Western nations usually place their domestic 
law above international agreements, and frequently bring 
fabricated charges against other countries according to their 
domestic law and take "reprisal" measures against the latter, 
resulting in international agreements existing in name only. 
For this reason, it is not so easy to truly seize this historic 
opportunity, and it is still necessary to make a great deal of 
effort.

  [Text] Seoul, January 26 (XINHUA) -- South Korea [ROK] and 
the United States are "positively" considering deployment of 
Patriot missiles at bases of the American forces in Korea, South 
Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said here Wednesday 
[26 January]. 
  "Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong 
said, "as to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be 
made after further consultations." 
  "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will 
enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability," he said. 
  South Korea will not purchase Patriot missiles and the anti- 
missile defense system will be part of the weaponry deployed by 
the U.S. forces in Korea at their bases, Hong added. 
  At present, about 36,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in 
South 
Korea.

  [Text] United Nations, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The Security 
Council today in a resolution extended the mandate of the U.N. 
Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA) to include observation 
of the country's elections on April 27, as suggested by the U.N. 
chief. 
  At the request of the transitional Executive Council of 
South 
Africa, Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had proposed the 
United Nations provide some 1,800 observers. Along with those 
from the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the European 
Union, the commonwealth and individual states, the total number 
of international observers would probably exceed 5,000. 
  The UNOMSA would have a significant role "not only in 
assessing the freedom and fairness of the elections, but in 
monitoring each stage of the process," the U.N. chief said in 
his recent report on South Africa. 
  The unanimously-adopted Resolution 894 urged all parties in 
South Africa, including those which did not participate fully in 
the multi-party talks, to respect agreements reached during the 
negotiations, to adhere to democratic principles, and to take 
part in the elections. 
  It also called upon all parties to take measures to end the 
violence and intimidation and thus contribute to the conduct of 
free and fair elections, and expects that anyone who seeks to 
disrupt the elections will be held accountable. 
  Speaking at the Security Council meeting today, Li Zhaoxing, 
Chinese permanent representative to the U.N., said the success 
of the election depends on the South African people themselves, 
and hoped that all parties in the country will make efforts to 
ensure the election be held on schedule. 
  At present there are 100 observers in UNOMSA, which was 
established in 1992 to assist in creating conditions for 
negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a 
democratic, non-racial and united South Africa.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Clinton's Initiatives Tough, </F>
Response Divided"] 
  [Text] Washington, January 25 (XINHUA) -- It was the warm 
and prolonged applause in the House Chamber that greeted 
President Bill Clinton's first state of the union address. 
  But after the speech, in the Statuary Hall, the lawmakers' 
response to Clinton's proposal on crime fighting and health care 
reform was divided. 
  The President, addressing the joint session of the Congress, 
outlined his major tasks for 1994, which include tougher 
penalties on criminals and a stronger push for health care and 
welfare reforms. 
  In his 11-minute response, Senate Minority Leader Robert 
Dole 
commented that this idea would "put a mountain of bureaucrats 
between you and your doctor." 
  Dole also said that the administration has damaged its 
credibility on the crime issue by cutting the federal prison 
construction budget by 20 percent. 
  Combining toughness and compassion in his speech, the 
President attempted to energize his setback-loaded one-year 
presidency, which however has gained in popularity. 
  According to the latest polls by ABC News, far ahead of the 
economy, crime posed as the top issue for average Americans, 
reversing the trend only half a year ago. 
  So people found few surprises in Clinton's speech which 
touched briefly on the economy, but was long on community 
policing, tougher penalties for criminals and increased funding 
for drug education. 
  "We cannot renew our country when 13-year-old boys get 
semi-automatic weapons and gun down nine-year-old boys -- just 
for the kick of it," Clinton said. 
  "We cannot renew our country when children are having 
children and the fathers of those children are walking away from 
them as if they don't amount to anything," he added. 
  Ric Fazio, a Democrat from California, said tonight's speech 
showed that Clinton has "begun to reach out and started to 
provide more leadership for the country, which is very risky in 
many ways." 
  "It should be a speech that unifies us, rather than divides 
us," complained Robert Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania, 
suggesting that the President spent too much time defining the 
Republicans as the bad guys on everything. 
  The Republicans disagreed with Clinton's health care reform, 
saying that the President's plan imposes too much bureaucracy on 
the industry which should be guided by market forces. 
  Clinton's health care proposal, first made last September, 
aims to guarantee health insurance for all Americans by the year 
1996, by way of asking employers to pay up to 80 percent of the 
insurance premiums for their employees. 
  U.S. health care spending consumes 14 percent of the 
country's gross domestic product. Last year, however, it 
witnessed the lowest increase in hospital bills and medical 
technology expenditures in years along with low inflation rates. 
  On crime fighting, most lawmakers agreed that Clinton's 
proposal on tougher penalties, including sending three-time 
offenders into prison for life, would get bipartisan support. 
  "Three strikes and you are out, yes. Community policing, 
yes. Strong measures like banning assault weapons, yes," 
responded Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota. 
  Some lawmakers, meanwhile, appeared anxious that since the 
nation's economic recovery was still unstable, much attention 
should be focused on arranging defense conversion and increasing 
employment. 
  "We're not seeing the rebound in our economy," said Olympia 
Snowe, a Republican from Maine. "The President should spend 
much more time on the issue." 
  Predicting 1994 as "a good year" for Clinton, Barbara 
Kennely, a Democrat from Connecticut, appeared worried that "we 
can't do it all because of the deficit."

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen returned here by air this 
morning, winding up his visit to African countries and France. 
  Among those greeting qian at the airport were Tian Zengpei, 
Chinese vice-foreign minister, and diplomatic envoys and 
officials from Madagascar, Eritrea, Kenya, Ethiopia, the Sudan 
and France. 
  Qian paid a goodwill visit to the above-mentioned five 
African countries as well as Mauritius from January 11 to 21. 
At the end of his trip in Africa, Qian went on to pay an 
official visit to France, where he also met U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren M. Christopher. 
  In an interview at the airport Qian told XINHUA that he was 
accorded a warm, grand and high-standarded reception during his 
visit to the six African countries. "This manifests the 
traditional friendship between China and African countries," he 
added. 
  He expressed satisfaction over the meetings and talks with 
French leaders. He held that these activities were of 
importance in strengthening mutual understanding and promoting 
the development of the relations between China and France as 
well as other west European countries. 
  Qian said he held constructive talks with U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher in Paris and exchanged views on international 
and bilateral matters, achieving understanding on some issues. 
  Qian expressed his belief that the meeting represents a 
major 
step in high-level contacts between China and the United States, 
hoping that Sino-U.S. exchanges will maintain the fine momentum.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States are to take effective measures to combat smuggling and 
illegal immigration. This was made clear during consultations 
between the two countries here on Monday [24 January]. 
  On the basis of mutual respect, equality and strengthening 
co-operation, the consultations were conducted between Zhang 
Hongxi, director of the Consular Affairs Department of the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Robert Gelbard. 
  During the consultations, the Chinese side analysed main 
reasons for the emergence of smuggling and illegal immigration, 
reiterated China's consistent principled stand that the Chinese 
Government has all along been against smuggling and illegal 
immigration, and briefed on the unremitting efforts and resolute 
measures the Chinese side had adopted in this sphere. 
  The Chinese side asked the U.S. to deal severe blows at 
"snake heads" -- people involved in organizing smuggling inside 
the territory of the U.S. 
  The Chinese side pointed out that China is resolutely 
against 
and cannot accept that "political asylum" should be offered to 
smugglers who ask the U.S. for "political protection". 
  Such people use so-called excuses such as that "the Chinese 
human rights situation is not good", or claim that they are 
"suffering from political persecution", or are against China's 
family-planning policy. The Chinese view is that wrongfully 
granting asylum in fact encourages smuggling and provides 
international smuggling organizations with opportunities. 
  While combating smuggling and stopping illegal immigration, 
the Chinese side held that normal exchanges between people of 
the two sides should be actively maintained, hoping that the 
U.S. side can ensure convenience for Chinese people who are on 
business or for private affairs apply for visas from the U.S. 
  The U.S. side said that the U.S. is formulating new laws so 
as to crack down on increasing illegal activities by 
international crime-committing organizations. 
  Paying much attention to combating smuggling activities, the 
U.S. side is willing to strengthen co-operation with China in 
enhancing direct contacts between the two sides and exchanging 
information, and severely punish those criminals. 
  The U.S. side also said that relevant U.S. bodies are ready 
to strengthen exchanges with relevant Chinese departments and 
enhance understanding between the two sides. 
  The two sides agreed to establish an ad hoc consultation 
system, further strengthen bilateral exchanges and co-operation 
between law-enforcing departments, exchange information in good 
time, and take effective measures to severely punish the 
"snake-heads" and stop smuggling and illegal immigration. 
  The two sides held that this effort is in conformity with 
the 
interests of the two countries.

expected to help promote the existing Sino-Russian relations, 
said Igor A. Rogachev, Russian ambassador to China, here this 
afternoon. 
  Rogachev, in an interview with XINHUA, said that Kozyrev's 
China tour, which will take place from January 26 to 29, is the 
first visit made by the Russian foreign minister outside the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) after the re-shuffle of 
the Russian Government. 
  He revealed that Kozyrev and the Chinese side will discuss 
bilateral relations. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the two sides will also confer on 
regional and international issues of mutual concern as well as 
briefing each other on the respective domestic situations. 
  Facts over the past years show that the two countries can 
conduct very good cooperation in many major international 
issues, he recalled. 
  The ambassador noted that both countries are carrying out 
reforms. And the Russian foreign minister will travel to the 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in south China's Guangdong 
Province during his stay in China. 
  He went on to say that Russian-Chinese relations in all 
fields have enjoyed smooth development since Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin visited China in December 1992. 
  In the economic and trade field, he said, the total trade 
volume of the two countries last year hit 7.7 billion U.S. 
dollars, an increase of 30 percent over 1992. 
  About 80 percent of the trade were conducted through over 20 
ports along the Sino-Russian border, and the two governments 
would sign an agreement concerning ports during Kozyrev's trip 
to China, he said. 
  Moreover, the two countries also have conducted good 
cooperation in science and technology, the ambassador noted.

  [Text] Moscow, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that the relationship of 
partners and cooperation between China and Russia should enter a 
state that conforms with the status of the two large countries 
and the evolving situation in Asia and the whole world. 
  The foreign minister made the statement at a symposium on 
the 
prospect of developing Sino-Russian border trade in Russia's far 
east city of Blagoveshchensk, ITAR-TASS reported. 
  Kozyrev said that last year, exclusive border trade volume 
between Russia and China amounted to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, 
and 2.5 million people crossed Sino-Russian border from both 
directions the same year. 
  At present, he said, the trade and cooperation between the 
border areas of the two countries should enter a higher stage of 
establishing joint ventures for production. Meanwhile, new 
transit ports should be opened along the border, he added. 
  The minister then crossed into China's Hei He City of 
Heilongjiang Province, where he met with government leaders of 
Heilongjiang and Hei He City, and discussed with them border 
trade. Kozyrev also visited a free economic zone in Hei He City. 
  He is due to arrive in Beijing today for an official visit 
to 
China.

<F P=106> ["Profile": "Gaydar Rejecting Post in New Cabinet" -- XINHUA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, January 16 (XINHUA) -- Russia's First 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, 37, said today he will not 
joint the new cabinet, the list of which is expected to be 
issued on Monday [17 January]. 
  At a news briefing, Gaydar, the "shock-therapy" economic 
reform architect in Russia, said: "I have decided to reject the 
offer made by the chairman of the government (Viktor 
Chernomyrdin) and not to take the post of the first 
vice-premier." 
  He said he categorically disagreed with the decisions taken 
by the government, including the signing of an interbank 
agreement on Belarus entering a monetary union with Russia and 
the government's decision to build a new parliamentary building 
which will cost 500 million U.S. dollars. 
  "I cannot be in the government and in the opposition at one 
and the same time," Gaydar said. 
  Gaydar, who is President Boris Yeltsin's top aide in charge 
of market-oriented economic reforms, told reporters that he 
discussed the issue with Yeltsin on Thursday and the president 
understood his position. 
  The "Russia's Choice" bloc's leader said that he intends to 
concentrate on his work in the state Duma, the lower house of 
the Parliament, adding that the bloc intends to do its best not 
to admit representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party led by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to key committees of the lower chamber -- 
the defense, security and international policy committees. 
  Last Monday, only one day before the new parliament's two 
chambers opened their first sessions respectively, Yeltsin 
signed a presidential decree on reshuffling the federal 
government with an aim to "improve the efficiency of the 
government's work." 
  In accordance with the order, there will be four deputy 
prime 
ministers instead of one, and two of them will be first deputy 
prime ministers. In addition, the government staff and the 
number of ministries and committees will be cut. 
  Meanwhile, the current government head Chernomyrdin was 
ordered to submit a reshuffle list as soon as possible. Gaydar 
had been seen most possible to become one of the first deputy 
prime minister in the new cabinet. 
  However, he himself rejected the possibility today. 
  Gaydar, who graduated from the economic faculty of the 
Moscow 
State University, is a master of economic sciences. 
  In the 1980s, he worked at several scientific, system 
research or economic institutes, and as an editor of the 
COMMUNIST journal and as an editor of the PRAVDA daily. 
  Between 1990 and 1991, Gaydar was director of the Institute 
of Economic Policy of the Soviet Economic Academy. In 1991-1992 
period, he was deputy chairman of the Russian Government in 
charge of economic reform and economics and finance minister of 
the former Soviet republic. 
  In the second half of 1992, he worked as acting prime 
minister chairman of Russia. 
  But in a secret ballot at the 7th Congress of the former 
Russian Parliament headed by Ruslan Khasbulatov, Gaydar failed 
to win the required majority of votes to be elected head of the 
Russian Government, and he was removed from the post of the 
acting prime minister. 
  In 1992, Gaydar was appointed by Yeltsin director of the 
Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional Period, and 
became Yeltsin's chief adviser for economic issues. 
  Last September, Gaydar was named by Yeltsin first deputy 
prime minister and performed the duties of economics minister. 
  Since last November, weeks before the Parliament elections 
started, Gaydar has been leader of the "Russia's Choice" bloc, 
now one of several big factions in the lower house.

  [Text] Moscow, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today accepted the resignation of First Deputy 
Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, while making assurances that the 
economic reforms which he had led in Russia will continue. 
  In a statement, Yeltsin said: "Giving tribute to the 
competence, courage and the contribution which Yegor Gaydar made 
to the course of economic reform, I understand the arguments and 
motives which made him offer to resign." 
  He stressed that although Gaydar has quit, the reform policy 
would continue and explained that Gaydar would work in the State 
Duma in the national interest as he had previously. 
  37-year-old Gaydar, the architect of Russia's economic 
reform, told reporters on Sunday [16 January] he had decided not 
to stay in the new cabinet, the full list of which is scheduled 
to be published on Tuesday. 
  As an explanation he said that the government had recently 
taken decisions with which he disagreed and without his presence. 
  This is the second time that Gaydar has left the government. 
In December 1992 Yeltsin had to remove him from the post of 
acting prime minister after a severe conflict with the former 
parliament over the course of reform. 
  Gaydar returned to the government as first deputy prime 
minister last September when Yeltsin dissolved the former 
parliament. 
  Gaydar, who is Yeltsin's top aide in charge of 
market-oriented economic reforms, said he had discussed the 
issue with the president on Thursday who understood his position. 
  He added that he intended to concentrate on his work in the 
state duma, the lower house of the Parliament, in which his 
"Russia's Choice" Party has a majority. 
  He said his party would try not to allow representatives of 
the Liberal Democratic Party, led by the right-wing Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, onto key committees of the lower chamber, such as 
defense, security and international policy committees.

  [Text] Moscow, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov has offered his resignation, radio here 
reported Tuesday [18 January]. 
  The news reports said Fedorov, also deputy prime minister in 
charge of financial affairs, had rejected the post of finance 
minister in the new government which did not carry with it a 
deputy prime minister's role. 
  Fedorov made the decision after Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and his first deputy Oleg Soskovets refused to meet 
his demands to sack chief banker Viktor Gerashchenko and Deputy 
Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. 
  According to the radio, Chernomyrdin asked Fedorov to remain 
in the cabinet, but the latter refused after his demands had 
been rejected. 
  In a related development, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor 
Gaydar resigned on Sunday. Gaydar, Yeltsin's architect of the 
country's market-oriented economic reform, is the leader of the 
"Russia's Choice" bloc. 
  Well-informed sources told reporters earlier today that 
Chernomyrdin would discuss the list of the new government with 
President Boris Yeltsin this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by XINHUA reporter Chen Ming] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Azerbaijan has 
suffered tremendous losses in the "Armenian aggression," with 
25,000 people killed, 1 million becoming refugees and 3,000 
villages destroyed, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hassan Hassanov 
[name as received] said here today. 
  The statement was made in an interview with XINHUA by the 
Azerbaijani foreign minister, who is attending the fourth annual 
meeting of the council of foreign ministers of the Economic 
Cooperation Organization (ECO), which opened here today. 
  Up to now, he said, "Armenian forces have occupied 20 
percent 
of our territories. As a result, 50,000 people became homeless, 
2,000 schools and hospitals were destroyed and ruined during the 
war." 
  Moreover, he warned, "Armenian forces are trying to launch a 
greater attack. They are even threatening us to occupy Baku, 
the capital of Azerbaijan. They have created a very strong 
army." 
  The minister told XINHUA, "we want to settle these problems 
peacefully and through negotiations with the Armenian 
authorities." 
  Therefore, he said, "we appealed to the world society and 
communities to demand that Armenians should obey U.N. Security 
Council resolutions and withdraw from our territories." 
  During the first session of the ECO council of ministers 
this 
morning, the Azerbaijani foreign minister also called on 
international organizations to give political support to his 
country and help solve the disputes. 
  In response to his call, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati, who is playing a mediation role between the two sides, 
said at the meeting that it is unfortunate and the conflict in 
the region has caused great concern among the people in the 
world. 
  He said that Iran would like to witness peaceful settlement 
of the dispute in the future. 
  Hikmet Cetin, foreign minister of Turkey, also expressed his 
concern about the conflict, saying, "The situation in southern 
Caucasus and especially the conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan require our immediate attention." 
  During his interview with XINHUA, Hassan Hassanov suggested 
three measures to settle the problems: 
  -- "The aggressors" should comprehend and realize that "it 
is 
aggression." 
  -- Azerbaijan should have a strong army to drive the 
"Armenian aggressors" out of the occupied territories. At the 
same time, Azerbaijan wants to settle those problems by peaceful 
means and negotiations. 
  -- The world organizations and the international community 
should force Armenia to obey the international rules and 
withdraw from its "occupied territories." 
  When asked whether Azerbaijan asked for military support 
from 
other countries, Hassan Hassanov said, "We mainly want political 
support to solve this problem and never asked other countries 
for military support because we do not like other countries to 
interfere in any state conflict." 
  In addition, he said, "we consider economic sanction should 
be adopted against Armenia because it uses economic support only 
for military purposes."

  [Text] Tehran, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Iranian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received] here today 
denied any competition between Iran and Turkey over Central Asia. 
  "No, there is no reason for us to compete with Turkey or 
other states," Mahmoud Vaezi said in an exclusive interview with 
XINHUA correspondents. 
  "There is a lot of room for cooperation, for work and 
activities" in the Central Asia, he said. "If turkey or any 
other countries want to enter the Central Asian region, they can 
and we welcome all the countries to enter the region for 
cooperation." 
  The world media have constantly reported that both the 
Islamic countries of Iran and Turkey want to occupy the vacuum 
in the Central Asian countries after the disintegration of the 
former Soviet Union. 
  Asked about the worry about Iran's Islamic export to the 
Central Asian countries, Vaezi termed the worry as unnecessary 
since Iran does not want to interfere in the internal affairs of 
any other countries. 
  "This is our policy. It does not matter whether it is a 
Central Asian country or an European country," he said, adding, 
"actually it is not the Central Asian countries that worry about 
the Islamic revolution." 
  "It is the Western correspondents who wrote such things 
everyday because they do not want good relations between Iran 
and those countries", Vaezi said. It is just a propaganda in 
order to separate Iran from those countries, he noted. 
  Referring to Iran's cooperation with the Central Asian 
countries, he said that Iran has started its cooperation with 
the Central Asian countries in many fields, such as 
telecommunications, air, road and shipping transportation, 
trade, industry and so on. 
  Four months ago when Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
visited five Central Asian countries, 64 documents were signed 
between Iran and those countries, most of which cover the fields 
of economic cooperation, he said. 
  The Central Asian countries have good resources but they 
need 
help in many fields, he said. The cooperation with those 
countries benefit both sides, he stressed. 
  Some Iranian officials said earlier that Iran could promote 
its non-oil export and reduce its reliance on oil revenue by 
reviving the ancient Silk Road and expanding cooperation with 
the Central Asian countries.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 26 (AFP)--The Chinese Government said 
Wednesday there was no possibility Pope John Paul II could visit 
Beijing so long as the Vatican persisted in refusing to 
recognise China and supported underground church movements. 
  "The Vatican must sever its so-called diplomatic relations 
with Taiwan, recognize (that) the government of the People's 
Republic of China is the sole legal government of China and 
Taiwan is part of Chinese territory," a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. 
  Beijing requires all countries with whom it has diplomatic 
relations to recognize it as the sole government of all China. 
It views Taiwan, the island to which defeated nationalist 
forces retreated after the civil war, as an outlaw province. 
  The Holy See "must also stop interfering in China's internal 
affairs, including its religious affairs," the spokesman said, 
referring to unofficial Chinese congregations gathering for 
worship. 
  "This is (a) matter of principle which should be solved in 
the first place in Sino-Vatican relations," he said. 
  The pope expressed hopes on Monday to visit China. It was 
the 
second time in less than a year that he has voiced such an 
ambition. 
  He said he did not want to forego a chance to build 
relations 
with Beijing and the state-sanctioned church, which is dependent 
on the communist party. But he added that much needed to be 
done ahead of establishing full diplomatic relations. 
  After the Chinese communists came to power in 1949, Beijing 
and the Vatican severed ties and the Holy See recognized Taiwan. 
  The Chinese government has created an official church but 
many among the country's Catholic population remain loyal to the 
pope, gathering in groups in a so-called "church of silence" 
supported by the Vatican.

  [Text] Paris, January 25 (XINHUA) -- French-Sino relations 
should have a fresh start after the publication of the joint 
communique on January 12, a French senior official said today. 
  Alain Peyrefitte, president of the France-China Friendship 
Society of the French National Assembly and former minister with 
the government of General de Gaulle, made the remarks in an 
interview with XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and the French-language 
monthly magazine "CHINA EXPRESS." 
  The former minister praised General de Gaulle who moved to 
establish diplomatic relations in the 1960s with the People's 
Republic of China and recognised it "as the representative of 
the Chinese nation." 
  China has offered many trade favors to France since the 
establishment of diplomatic ties in 1964. And France has become 
the third biggest trade partner of China by 1992, only after the 
U.S. and Japan. 
  However, France's share in the Chinese market has diminished 
after it decided to sell arms to Taiwan, for which France has 
lost business contracts of estimated six billion francs (1.2 
billion U.S. Dollars) in China. 
  "After the normalization of relations between France and 
China, the French industries will invest again in the market at 
full steam," said Peyrefitte. 
  He noted the Chinese are ready to make "a big jump towards 
market economy" and their economic development has great 
potentials. 
  Peyrefitte said France can make use of its "considerable 
advantages" in transport, telecommunications and energy in 
cooperation with China and expand its export and investment in 
other Asian countries through joint-ventures and transfers of 
technology. 
  In conclusion, he said, "all foreign investors are actively 
involved in China's modernization drive, and it is in the 
interests of France to join them." 
  The former French minister is leaving for China Wednesday to 
participate in the ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 
and prepare for the coming visit by French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur.

  [Text] Guangzhou--Sofretu, a French transportation 
engineering giant, clinched a consultancy contract over the 
weekend with the Guangzhou Metro Corporation to help supervise 
and manage the construction of the new subway here. 
  "The normalization of Sino-French relations will make our 
participation in the metro work easier," said Jean-Michel 
Kuntzer, Vice President of Sofretu's Asia &amp; Oceania Company, 
at 
the signing ceremony. 
  Kuntzer, who is on his 25th trip to Guangzhou in connection 
with the project, also said that his company has been working on 
the project with the Guangzhou side for more than seven years. 
  "We have a good relationship with the municipal government 
and local engineers," Kuntzer added. 
  According to the $5 million-plus contract, Sofretu will send 
200 subway experts to Guangzhou to provide technical and 
engineering consultancy for the most difficult part of the Phase 
1 project in Guangzhou subway. 
  In the meantime, Chinese engineers will be sent to study at 
Sofretu's headquarters -- the Paris Metro Company. 
  The Huangsha-Tianhe section, which extends eight-kilometres 
through the city's busiest area, will be built through shield 
tunneling, an underground construction method that meets 
international standards. 
  In addition to its business here, Sofretu is involved in the 
renovation of the Beijing Metro network, which was built more 
than 20 years ago. 
  And for more than two years, it has been doing research with 
the Shanghai government on the city's transportation network. 
  "As China plans to build light railways in more than 20 
cities, we are hoping to enlarge our business here," said 
Kuntzer.

<F P=106> [Article by Hua Wen (5478 2429): "Inglorious </F>
Record--Various Kinds of Trouble Britain Left Behind in Its 
Former Colonies"] 
  [Text] Britain used to have the largest colonial empire in 
the world. By the end of World War II, the struggle of Asian 
and African peoples for national independence was spreading like 
a storm, and Britain was compelled to withdraw from its former 
colonies. However, in the course of its withdrawal, Britain 
took great care to use various inglorious means and tricks; it 
sowed discord between different races, religious sects, tribes, 
and other political forces to spark contradictions and 
conflicts, thus implementing "divide and rule"; or forced the 
implementation of mergers in the form of a "federal state," 
namely, "merge and rule"; or went all out to prop up a 
pro-British government. In a nutshell, it attempted to continue 
to maintain British vested interests and maximise political 
influence. 
  "Divide and rule" was one of Britain's usual notorious 
methods, and India served as the most typical example. In 1943, 
Britain set forth a policy of "divide and rule," and advocated 
the division of India into three governing regions, namely, 
separating India into a Hindu region, a Muslim region, and a 
region of various princely states and feudatories. Lord Louis 
Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India, dished up his 
"divide and rule" plan in June 1946, which partitioned India 
into three--two dominions, India and Pakistan, and various 
princely states and feudatories. At the same time, it was 
stipulated that the princely states and feudatories had the 
right to decide on their own to join any of the two dominions, 
with the aim of using the princes of the Indian princely states 
and feudatories as a force to counter the Indian nationalist 
movement; and second, it sowed discord in relations between 
Muslims and the Hindus, and this eventually led to the partition 
of India and Pakistan. Indian and Pakistani historians 
indicated this by hitting the nail on the head, saying that the 
aim of the partition of India and Pakistan plotted meticulously 
by Britain was to make these two countries weak and make things 
difficult for them to stand on their own feet. Of course, 
history did not develop in the way the British colonialists 
hoped for. On the Palestine issue, Britain first encouraged the 
Arabs of the Ottoman Empire to resist Turkish rule; later, they 
hoisted the banner of supporting the Zionist movement, roping in 
the Jews to elbow out the Arabs at one point, then taking 
advantage of the Arabs to oppose the Jews at another. In 
Cyprus, to split the anti-British struggle of the local people, 
Britain encouraged Turkish Cypriots to confront the EOKA, the 
anti-British Greek Cypriot organization. Later, Britain led 
Greece and Turkey into Cyprus' internal conflict; consequently, 
the sovereignty of this island state fell apart. Furthermore, 
this resulted in complicated contradictions and conflicts 
between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus, and between Turkish Cypriots 
and Greek Cypriots, while turning the Cyprus issue into an 
international hot spot. 
  Sometimes, Britain pushed the strategy of "merge and rule" 
in 
some regions through forcing together "federations" by force. A 
typical example was the "Central African Federation," which 
Britain patched up. In 1953, the British Government merged 
British Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and formed 
a so-called "Federation of Central Africa." This was out of 
British political and economic considerations. Economically, 
Northern Rhodesia abounded in copper, Southern Rhodesia had 
skilled Caucasian technicians, and Nyasaland possessed a huge 
cheap labor force. Welding those three factors into an economic 
federation was conducive to Britain's maintenance of its 
economic interests in this region. Politically, the Caucasian 
immigrants in Southern Rhodesia were powerful and controlled the 
local government; with the organization of the "federation," the 
influence of the Caucasians of Southern Rhodesia would extend to 
all of British Central Africa, thus suppressing newly rising 
black nationalism in Africa. Nevertheless, the "Central African 
Federation" went bankrupt in 1963 because of the strong 
opposition of its black African inhabitants. 
  In addition, another important policy target of Britain in 
the course of its withdrawal from its colonies was to prop up 
pro-British forces, and it transferred power to pro-British 
governments. National independence and liberation movements with 
a strong momentum broke out in British colonies in south, and 
Southeast Asia in the early post-war years. India at that time 
was like "a loaded ship on fire in the ocean." Britain was 
compelled to make the decision to withdraw quickly from India, 
while transferring political power into the so-called "hands of 
Indian who have a sense of responsibility" to prevent 
catastrophe for Britain. It was precisely in this way that 
Britain realized a "peaceful transfer of political power" in 
India, while a whole range of organizations of old colonial rule 
were retained, while India and Pakistan remained members of the 
British Commonwealth of Nations, and British private capital in 
India was left intact. In the early post-war years, the Burmese 
People's Movement vigorously developed. To avoid being 
thoroughly driven out from Burma, Britain rapidly transferred 
political power to "moderates," who were acceptable to Britain. 
British economic interests and military bases in Burma basically 
remained intact. Britain's method in Malaysia was almost 
undisguised. The Malaysian people had already emancipated the 
country during the war of resistance against Japan. When the 
British Army returned to Malaysia, it started to restore the 
colonial order in Malaysia. Later, Britain announced a state of 
emergency in Malaysia, and Britain eventually transferred 
political power in the mid-1950's, when the situation had 
basically stabilized. 
  The various tricks Britain resorted to in the course of its 
withdrawal from its colonies left the former colonial countries 
endless hidden dangers after independence. This found 
conspicuous expression in long-term turbulence in the political 
situations of these countries in the wake of their independence, 
and endless conflicts between neighboring countries or within 
countries, whereas socioeconomic development was impeded and 
restricted. In "divide and rule," Britain implemented 
artificial partitions or mergers of territory in former 
colonies, thus creating numerous complicated nationality and 
border issues for the independent countries later on. In August 
1947, Britain hastily withdrew from India two months after the 
Mountbatten plan was presented, which resulted in slaughter 
between the religious sects and an escalation of turmoil. 
Statistics show that 500,000 people died directly or indirectly 
in the turmoil, and 5 million people fled from their homes. 
Based on the Mountbatten plan, Pakistan was founded in two 
separate areas in the east and the west, some 1,600 km away from 
each other; the inconvenience in transportation resulted in 
extremely great difficulties in economic development. The 
rivalry between India and Pakistan over Kashmir resulted in 
several armed conflicts, and the issue remains unresolved as of 
today. Britain's implementation of "divide and rule" in 
Palestine left a large number of Palestinian refugees homeless. 
The long-running confrontation between the Arabs and Israel and 
the four Middle East wars that broke out one after the other all 
find their roots in British "divide and rule." Likewise, the 
civil war and divisions between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek 
Cypriots after Cyprus' independence, and the conflict between 
Greece and Turkey are all inseparable from the evil consequences 
of what Britain did during its rule in Cyprus. 
  The British colonialists created divisions in Nigeria by 
utilizing contradictions between various tribes to instigate 
regional separatism and jeopardize Nigeria's national solidarity 
and unification, while sowing the seeds for long-term internal 
disturbances after Nigeria's independence. In the late 1960's, 
the Nigerian Civil War that centered around the independence of 
Biafra cost 1 million lives, and economic and social development 
was seriously damaged. Britain bears unshirkable responsibility 
for all of this.

  [Text] Hefei, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Anhui, one of China's 
major agricultural producers, has used some foreign capital to 
boost its agriculture. 
  Figures just released show that the province has used 380 
million yuan loaned by the World Bank, and has since 1980 been 
aided by international organizations in the development of farm 
and irrigation projects in the plains and in helping areas hit 
by disasters. 
  By now, many farm capital projects have been carried out and 
more than one million hectares of low-yield farmland transformed 
and improved. 
  One example is a farm project in the plain north of the Huai 
River in the province, which was listed as part of the overall 
north China plain agricultural project. 
  Through a ten-year effort with loans from the World Bank, 
farmers involved in the project have dug and dredged 7,500 
kilometers of irrigation canals and ditches dotted with pumping 
stations; built more than 400 kilometers of roads; installed 
1,168 kilometers of cables and planted 47 million trees around 
the farmland. 
  They have also changed the production pattern, to develop 
quality and efficient agriculture and animal husbandry while 
setting up rural industrial enterprises. 
  The work was highly praised by officials of the World Bank 
who visited Anhui last year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anhui Raises Financial Work to New </F>
Level"] 
  [Text] Last year, thanks to all levels of governments' 
further unified thinking on financial management, stepping up 
reform efforts, expanding sources of revenue, and cutting back 
on spending, the finances of the entire province rose to new 
heights. According to statistics, the province's financial 
revenue in 1993 was 7.32 billion yuan, an increase of 32.7 
percent over the same period last year. At the same time, 
because of strict controls on and a rational arrangement for 
spending, the province basically realized a balance in revenues 
and expenditures and satisfactorily fulfilled the 1993 financial 
targets set out by the new term of the provincial government. 
  Because of correct decisionmaking, the provincial CPC 
committee and the provincial government achieved satisfactory 
results. Last year, in view of the province's difficult 
financial situation, the provincial CPC committee and the 
provincial government called on all localities to build up 
confidence and to reverse the financial situation. They called 
for achieving 7 billion yuan in revenues in 1993 and for 
realizing a basic balance in revenues and expenditures. They 
worked out an eight-point plan on promoting the financial work 
and set out specific demands on reaching the targets for 
financial revenue and balance, and on devising measures to 
realize these targets. The provincial government also signed 
letters of responsibility with provincial financial departments, 
various commissions, and city governments. 
  At the same time, all levels of departments changed their 
thinking on financial management and also implemented the 
thinking of self-reliance, of increasing revenues and reducing 
expenditures, and of striving to achieve a balance through their 
own efforts. Party committees and governments increased and 
strengthened their support and leadership over financial work 
and exerted more effort to explore new sources of revenue and to 
cut expenses. While striving to increase sources of revenue, 
many local governments also made efforts to rectify defects in 
the fiscal contract responsibility system, to prevent revenue 
losses, to exercise strict control over granting tax reductions 
and tax exemptions, and to ensure the steady growth of financial 
revenues. In 1993, prefectures and cities witnessed a 
comprehensive growth in revenues. The province recorded a 
breakthrough in revenues of more than 6 billion yuan, which was 
followed by another breakthrough in revenues of more than 7 
billion yuan. Many localities not only achieved a balance in 
revenues and expenditures but also eliminated some of their past 
deficits. None of the counties under the jurisdiction of 
Xuancheng Prefecture suffered financial deficits over the past 
decade. The province's deficits in 1993 were down from the 
projected deficits by more than 500 million yuan. The improved 
financial situation has greatly promoted the province's 
sustained, healthy, and rapid development of its economy.

  [Text] The Sixth Enlarged Session of the Fujian Military 
District's Sixth Party Committee concluded in Fuzhou a few days 
ago. Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
provincial governor, and first secretary of the provincial 
military district's party committee, attended the session and 
made an important speech. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, 
Jia Qinglin expressed his kind regards to all officers and 
soldiers of the provincial military district and wished them a 
happy new year. He thanked all officers and men who have 
defended, supported, and contributed to Fujian's two 
civilizations. Subsequently, he briefed them on Fujian's 
achievements in establishing the socialist market economic 
structure and other aspects of social undertakings. 
  Jia Qinglin said: All these achievements cannot be separated 
from the support of the People's Liberation Army or from the 
hard work of soldiers and civilians. 
  Jia Qinglin pointed out: To scale a new height in economic 
development, Fujian needs a more stable and relaxed environment. 
Armed forces units in the provincial military district undertake 
the important responsibility of safeguarding the motherland's 
southeastern coast. They should have a strong sense of mission 
and responsibility, strengthen their training on combat 
readiness, improve their tactics and skills, and enhance their 
combat effectiveness. 
  Jia Qinglin stressed: In this new situation when we are 
stepping up the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure, we should make major efforts to carry forward the 
Fujian Army's and civilians' glorious tradition in two-support 
work, strengthen the unity between the Army and the government 
and between the Army and civilians, enhance the friendship 
between the Army and localities and between the Army and 
civilians, and jointly create a safe and stable social 
environment. 
  The session summed up the provincial military district's 
work 
last year and arranged this year's work. At the session, the 
provincial military district commended a number of advanced 
units and individuals and conferred Merit Citation Class Two and 
Three on those who had performed extraordinarily well.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon provincial leaders Jia Qinglin, 
Wang Jianshuang, and Shi Xingmou met with managers and directors 
of several factories and enterprises in Fuzhou to discuss their 
difficulties and seek ways to resolve them. Provincial party 
Secretary and Governor Jia Qinglin requested that leaders of 
party committees and governments, as well as the relevant 
departments, visit enterprises and their employees' family 
members having difficulties, to deliver the warmth of the party 
and government. They should show concern for enterprises which 
have difficulties and their staff members' lives and regard this 
as their political task. 
  The Jinjiang shipping company, the Fuzhou canned food 
factory, the Fuzhou livestock farm, and the Fuzhou fireproof 
materials factory, which are all having difficulties, reported 
to the provincial leaders on their situations. After listening 
to their reports, Jia Qinglin made an important speech. 
  He said: This year is an important year for our province to 
[words indistinct]. There are factors causing difficulties 
currently arising in businesses. Leaders, the departments in 
charge of enterprises, and the enterprises themselves should 
actively seek ways to resolve their difficulties. In light of 
their special features and strong points, they should engage in 
diversified operations and explore tertiary industries. 
  He added: Using land superiority and foreign capital for 
transformation is a good method to free enterprises from their 
difficulties. Leaders of governments and departments at all 
levels should also seek ways and opportunities to resolve these 
enterprises' problems and should improve the social insurance 
system so as to create good external conditions for these 
enterprises to eliminate their difficulties. Particular 
attention should now be paid to making good arrangements for 
staff members' lives so that they can spend the Spring Festival 
happily.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Rural reforms which 
started in China in the late 1970s have made township 
enterprises a major contributor to Jiangsu Province's economic 
development. 
  In Jiangsu, township enterprises and tertiary industry in 
the 
countryside account for about half of its GDP -- the value of 
goods and services produced. 
  In the rural areas of the province, township enterprises and 
rural tertiary industry rose to 86 percent of the total output 
value in 1993 from 50 percent in 1978, an 11 percent increase 
over that of 1991. 
  Traditionally, agriculture has been confined to the 
countryside in China and industry to cities. Township 
enterprises came into being only in the 1970s. 
  In 1978, township enterprises and other non-agricultural 
tertiary industries for the first time produced half of 
Jiangsu's agricultural output value. Their golden age came in 
the 1990s when the Chinese Government decided to develop the 
market economy in cities. 
  The past three years were the fastest development period for 
township enterprises in Jiangsu. 
  In 1992, the industrial output value produced by township 
enterprises increased by more than 100 billion yuan over the 
previous year to 300 billion. In 1993 it leapt to 400 billion 
yuan. 
  Seven of the top 10 most developed counties in China are in 
Jiangsu. 
  In 1993, township enterprises in the province contributed to 
about 45 percent of the province's revenue turned over to the 
state. 
  For the past few years, about three-fourths of the 
province's 
increased GDP has come from the countryside, where 80 percent of 
the added output value has come from township enterprises. 
  Meanwhile, township enterprises have exerted influence on 
the 
layout of China's cities. Thousands of small towns which have 
been born and prospered on the basis of township enterprises 
link the countryside with cities. In some areas, cities can 
hardly be distinguished from the countryside.

  [Text] Nanjing 23 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--According to the local 
press, the 15 districts and counties under Nanjing's 
jurisdiction started to recall the book, "A City in Ruins," 
today, according to a just-issued explicit banning order. 
  The Nanjing City Office for Social and Cultural 
Administration adopted this measure based on a circular which 
was only received yesterday. On 20 January, the Beijing

in the category of publications containing contents that are 
pornographic, vulgar, of low taste, and are harmful to the 
physical and mental health of teenagers." The decision to deal 
with the book "A City in Ruins," published by the Beijing 
Publishing House, is as follows: "The printing and circulation 
of the book `A City in Ruins' must be halted, and its reprinting 
banned. All copies that have already been printed but not yet 
circulated or which are being sold in the book market must be 
totally recalled; all of the Beijing Publishing House's profits 
derived from publishing the book 'A City in Ruins' should be 
confiscated in addition to a fine double that of the profits; 
Beijing Publishing House is ordered to write an examination for 
publishing the book 'A City in Ruins,' and the person 
responsible for the book 'A City in Ruins' will be seriously 
dealt with."

  [Text] Shanghai, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai customs 
will begin a three-tiered classification system for companies 
dealing with foreign trade, according to customs director Cao 
Hengli. 
  "The move indicates that customs emphasis has been turned 
from the inspection of import and export goods to the oversight 
of companies dealing in the goods," Cao said. 
  With reference to international conventions, Shanghai 
customs 
will classify foreign trade companies in accordance with their 
internal operation and previous cooperation with customs. 
  The first class, including companies with a high business 
reputation, will enjoy preference and more preferential 
treatment when undergoing customs affairs. So far there are 
altogether 24 such companies in Shanghai. 
  Companies with a less than stellar business reputation fall 
into the second tier, while those with poor management or 
suspected of illegal trafficking will have their import and 
export goods strictly examined at customs, the director. 
  Every year, the Customs Office will hold appraisals to 
upgrade or demote the companies according to their achievements. 
  Along with rapid economic growth, more than 9,000 companies 
were dealing with foreign trade in Shanghai by the end of last 
year. There were only some 200 companies in 1985. 
  During the same time, the value of import and export goods 
through customs increased from 14.87 billion U.S. dollars to 
30.9 billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest industrial metropolis, intends to expand its market 
share of industrial products this year, according to local 
officials in charge of industrial affairs. 
  Industrial enterprises are called upon to further readjust

large industrial groups will be formed and overseas economic 
contacts will be greatly enhanced, the officials said. 
  The city is now making efforts to promote some of its pillar 
industries, such as automobiles, program-controlled telephones, 
facilities for power stations and computers. 
  A number of leading state enterprises, especially some 
chemical firms, will co-operate with established international 
companies to turn out high-tech products with great market 
potential. 
  Statistics show that last year the total industrial output 
of 
Shanghai increased by 18 percent over the previous year after 
three years of two-digit growth. The growth rate has been set

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Guo Weicheng (6753 0251 2052): "Shanghai Ranks </F>
First Among Chinese Cities in Foreign Trade Last Year"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 10 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Shanghai Customs 
have firmly grasped the in-depth reform of their vocational 
work, promoted the work focus for economic development, and 
accelerated reform of the customs clearance system in a positive 
way. According to statistics, Shanghai's total value of import 
and exports reached $30.93 billion in real terms last year, 
representing an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, 
and holding a leading position among cities nationwide. 
  Shanghai Customs, which is responsible for supervising and 
controlling goods going to and from Shanghai's port, has played 
an enormous role in promoting the functional development of 
Pudong New District and the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, supporting 
Shanghai's export trade, and expediting the construction of 
municipal infrastructure facilities and the development of new 
hi-tech industry. Last year, they helped over 2,200 
enterprises, who took care of customs declaration work 
themselves, go through the formalities of customs registration 
and handle tax reduction or remission procedures for 10,000 
consignments with a value of $890 million, and 2.96 billion yuan 
in taxes was reduced or remitted, which represents an increase 
of 257 percent over the corresponding period last year. 
  Using the normal practices of free trade zones overseas for 
reference, Shanghai Customs has successively formulated eight 
measures for managing the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone and practiced a 
new model of supervision and control, which is both simple and 
flexible, in the closed area of the zone, thereby achieving the 
objective of handling matters within the zone and pushing 
forward the comprehensive development of business in the bonded 
zone. Shanghai Customs has also taken the initiative in helping 
to boost Shanghai's foreign trade and vigorously broadening the 
scope of business in the bonded zone. A total of 21 new bonded 
factories and 34 bonded warehouses were approved last year. At 
present, Shanghai boasts eight bonded groups, 187 bonded 
factories, and 297 bonded warehouses, which have initially 
formed a bonded zone supervisory and management system 
characterized by comprehensive categories, multiple levels, and 
great adaptability.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai automobile 
sales topped 30 billion yuan in 1993, with a total net profit 
surpassing 2.5 billion, registering a hefty 50 percent rise from 
the year before, according to the latest statistics released by 
the municipal government. 
  The lion's share of the earnings came from the Shanghai 
Volkswagen Corp., a main producer of "Santana" sedans, and its 
related manufacturers. 
  The total output of Santanas jumped to 100,000 last year 
from 
65,000 in 1992. 
  The production of the same make for the new year is targeted 
at 115,000, and a brand new model of Santana will appear on the 
market toward the end of the year. 
  At the same time, work has been stepped up on the second 
phase of the "Volkswagen" technical transformation project, and 
the year 1994 will see a new major auto-maker with a production 
capacity of 200,000 Santanas. 
  It was reported that the sales slump of Santana cars has 
been 
arrested thanks to new measures taken to promote sales. In 
addition, the auto's cost has been reduced as more than 80 
percent of the parts are produced locally and import duties have 
been lowered on some parts. 
  All these have gone a long way to increase the 
competitiveness of Shanghai's automobiles.

  [Excerpt] "We should regard environmental protection work 
as a major content to assess cadres' official performances." 
This is the remark on environmental protection recently made by 
Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, and 
Zhao Zhihao, governor of the province, that was relayed at the 
provincial environmental protection work conference. Comrade 
Jiang Chunyun said: Top leaders of the provincial party 
committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, 
and the provincial government should all personally take a hand 
in environmental protection work. The provincial government and 
the provincial people's congress standing committee should 
assign special persons to take charge of this work. We should 
regard the success or failure in environmental protection work 
as one of major contents to assess the official performances of 
leading cadres. Those who perform well should be commended, and 
those who do not should be criticized and educated. Comrade Zhao 
Zhihao said: It is arduous and difficult for us to control 
environmental pollution. Principal leading comrades of party 
and government organizations must personally take a hand in this 
work and list it as a major item on their daily agenda. 
  The provincial environmental protection work conference was 
held in Taian from 25 to 27 December. The conference reviewed 
and summarized the province's environmental protection situation 
over the past several years and researched and arranged the 
tasks for the future work. The conference called for great 
effort to fulfill ahead of schedule the following targets, set 
by the Eighth Five-Year Plan: Basically stabilizing the quality 
of the atmospheric environment of major cities in the province; 
preventing the source of drinking water of cities from being 
polluted and preventing the pollution of underground water from 
being worsened; lowering the environmental noise of major 
traffic lines and regions in the province; preventing the 
polluted degree and acreage of two rivers (Xiaoqing He and Yu 
He), two lakes (Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake), and two bays 
(Jiaozhou Bay and Laizhou Bay) from expanding; and bring the 
trend of the worsening natural ecological environment under 
control. [passage omitted]

furnace for enhancing the party spirit of cadres and for 
cultivating and tempering cadres. 
  Before the convocation of this conference, Jiang Chunyun, 
secretary of the provincial party committee and president of the 
Party School of the provincial party committee, put forward 
specific demands on the work of party schools. He said: During 
the past year, the whole province achieved noticeable 
improvements in both the work of party schools and reform. 
Party committees at all levels and all party schools should 
further intensify their consciousness on reform, regard the 
deepening of reform as the basic motivation for promoting the 
work of party schools and grasp it firmly and well until good 
results are achieved. We should carry out reform measures and 
methods that help the enhancement of teaching quality and the 
level of scientific research and the mobilization of enthusiasm 
and creativity in teaching and administrative staff according to 
our capability, and do our best. 
  The conference felt that under the new historical 
conditions, 
the tasks of party schools should not be lightened, but 
strengthened; the status of party schools have not been lowered, 
but become more important; and party school education should 
only be strengthened, but not weakened. Party committees at all 
levels should further strengthen leadership over the work of 
party schools and actively help them solve practical problems in 
the course of development. Financial departments at all levels 
should actively support party school education and construction 
with financial input. Party schools at all levels should vie to 
be the first-grade party schools with the spirit of reform and 
blazing new trials. 
  Dong Fengji, member of the standing committee of the 
provincial party committee and director of the Propaganda 
Department of the provincial party committee, attended and 
addressed the conference.

  [Text] Weihai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The Weihai High-Tech 
Development Zone in Weihai city, Shandong Province, is striving 
to attract more overseas capital this year. 
  According to plan, it is ready to house an additional 220 
projects, of which 80 are industrial projects involving 3.5 
billion yuan and 100 foreign-funded projects with 300 million 
U.S. dollars, this year. 
  Li Guodong, chairman of the zone's administrative committee,

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Shen Peigen, an 
official of Xinjiang township in the Hangjiahu Plain in northern 
Zhejiang Province, is excited when he talks about the changes in 
his hometown. 
  "We used to depend on farming alone, and our lives improved 
only slowly," said Shen, secretary of the township committee of 
the Communist Party. 
  Encouraged by the government, the township has set up 160 
enterprises in the fields of leather, light and textile 
industries, hardware and machinery, and building materials in 
addition to food-processing, chemicals and electronics over the 
past decade. 
  As a result, the township's industrial output value rose 
from 
180 million yuan in 1991 to 260 million yuan in 1992, and to 508 
million yuan last year, Shen said. 
  While boosting rural industry, the local government has 
encouraged farmers to arrange agricultural production and 
diversify the economy in line with market demands. 
  According to the latest statistics, Xinjiang turns out 
between 8,000 tons and 10,000 tons of grain a year. 
  Last year its gross output value reached 565 million yuan, 
sales income 910 million yuan, profits and taxes 59.34 million 
yuan and financial revenue 12.75 million yuan last year -- all 
records. 
  Its farmers' incomes averaged 2,060 yuan per capita in 1993, 
also a record. 
  With more money in hand, farmers have built two- and 
three-story buildings to replace their single-story houses. 
  Most farmers have equipped their households with color 
televisions, refrigerators and cassette recorders, and some have 
even bought hi-fi sound systems and motorcycles. Many of them 
have a considerable amount of savings deposits in banks. 
  A provincial official in charge of agriculture said Xinjiang 
township is a typical example of townships across the province, 
which is leading farmers toward a comfortable life. 
  According to a rural development plan, the annual income of 
farmers in the province will reach 1,600 yuan per capita by the 
end of 1995, and 2,200 yuan by the end of this century. 
  The provincial government has conferred the title "townships 
with strong economic development" on 103 townships including 
Xinjiang. 
  Experts in rural development agree that the purpose of the 
rural economic reform is to promote the development of the rural 
commodity economy and gradually replace the traditional 
self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy with modern farming. 
  According to statistics, the past five years were a high 
point for the overall development of Zhejiang's rural economy. 
  Zhejiang's gross output value of farm, forestry, animal 
husbandry and fishery products last year reached 39.36 billion 
yuan, an increase of 18.7 percent over 1988. 
  Its rural industrial output value rose from 54.275 billion 
yuan in 1988 to 255.2 billion yuan last year, accounting for 
two-thirds of the gross provincial industrial output value. 
  Farmers' incomes climbed from 1,000 yuan per capita in 1990 
to 1,590 yuan last year. 
  Economists here analyzed that the increase comes mainly from 
the diversified economy instead of only from growing grain.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee member and Guangdong 
Provincial CPC Committee secretary, delivered an important 
speech at a meeting at which provincial department-level cadres 
from Guangzhou and across the province reported their study of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  In his speech, Xie Fei first and foremost called for 
attaching great importance to theory study. He also called on 
leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in studying and 
applying the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in the process of in-depth reform and rapid 
socialist market economic structure building, deeming it an 
important task at the moment. 
  Xie Fei maintained: In theory study we should concentrate on 
studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, as well as modern knowledge and 
socialist market economic theory. At present, we should focus 
on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and the book What Is the 
Socialist Market Economy, as well. 
  In the end, Xie Fei emphatically stated: In order to push 
forward the ongoing modernization drive and basically realize 
modernization in Guangdong within a period of 20 years, we 
should strive to improve the quality of leading cadres, heighten 
their leadership standard, and refine their leadership skills. 
To this end, leading cadres at all levels should spend more time 
and devote more energies to theory study, take theory study as 
an important task, and successfully accomplish such a task as 
arming the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] Hong Kong, January 21 (XINHUA) -- A number of new 
measures will be implemented later this year at the check points 
in Shenzhen, a city in southern China which borders Hong Kong, 
to facilitate the land freight shipment between the two areas. 
  Speaking at a press conference held today in Shenzhen, Yu 
Xiaosong, a senior Chinese official with the State Council, said 
that the new measures were made to meet the increasing demand of 
the freight exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  Yu, a vice minister of the State Commission for Economy and 
Trade, said that the six new measures which are mainly designed 
to simplify procedures and save time for the freight vehicles 
passing through the three check points will be put into force on 
March 1, 1994. 
  Besides, the Chinese side has also decided to open the three 
freight check points for 24 hours a day later this year as a 
further effort to facilitate the freight exchanges between the 
two areas, said Yu, adding that this still entails discussions 
with the Hong Kong side. 
  Yu was in Shenzhen to attend a two-day on-the-spot business 
meeting organized by his commission to examine and solve the 
problems regarding the land freight shipment between the 
mainland and Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [By Wang Chu (3769 2806): "Shenzhen's Export Volume Amounts </F>
to $7.8 Billion Last Year"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 11 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--Shenzhen City's 
export volume, which has always put expanding exports and 
developing foreign trade in an important position, reached $7.8 
billion last year. This was the first time its export volume 
had exceeded that of Shanghai and it ranked first among the 
large cities in the country. 
  Last year, Shenzhen's foreign trade enterprises were 
troubled 
by undesirable factors such as shortages of funds, drastic 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and difficulties in tax 
reimbursement. Shenzhen City government judged the hour, sized 
up the situation, did solid work for enterprises, pooled funds 
through various channels, made use of foreign trade and export 
regulation funds, and speeded up the checking of tax 
reimbursements. Thanks to the effective measures, Shenzhen's 
foreign trade enterprises were able to avoid a big slide in 
exports under an extremely difficult situation. 
  While consolidating its markets in Hong Kong and Macao, 
Shenzhen has made great efforts to develop its markets in the 
Asia-Pacific region and to open up market in the CIS, Eastern 
Europe, South America, and Africa. These are the main features 
of Shenzhen's foreign trade and exports last year. According to 
reports, Shenzhen's export volume to Africa last year was over 
10 times that of the previous year and its exports to South 
America, and to the CIS and Eastern Europe were respectively 
891.72 and 429.39 percent that of the previous year. The 
implementation of a pluralistic strategy in developing foreign 
trade markets has laid a firm foundation for Shenzhen City to 
increase its foreign trade and exports. 
  There were also reports on Shenzhen's success in earning 
foreign exchange with agricultural products and fresh and live 
products earned as much as HK$1 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in 
foreign exchange last year.

  [Text] Haikou, January 19 (XINHUA) -- The first generating 
unit of the Daguangba Hydropower Station was put into operation 
a few days ago in the western part of south China's Hainan 
Province. 
  As one of the key national projects of the Eighth Five-Year 
Program (1991-1995), the project invited bidding for design in 
the country for the first time. Some new technologies have been 
utilized in its construction. 
  The dam of the station is 5,842 meters long, now the longest 
in China. Another three generating units, each with a 
generating capacity of 60,000 kw, will be installed. 
  After its completion in 1995, the station is expected to 
produce 520 million kwh every year. It will also irrigate an 
area of 67,000 hectares of the island province. 
  Work started in 1990 and the project used world bank loans 
of 
67 million U.S. dollars in addition to Chinese investment.

  [Excerpts] The provincial party committee held a forum for 
locally based non-CPC-affiliated individuals on the afternoon of 
13 January. Provincial leaders, including [Party Secretary] Li 
Changchun, Song Zhaosu, Zheng Zengmao, Song Guochen, and Hu 
Shujian, frankly exchanged views at the forum with individuals 
in charge of the provincial branches of various democratic 
parties, persons in charge of the provincial industry and 
commerce federation, and a number of well-known individuals 
without any party affiliation and discussed with them various 
issues, such as opposing corruption and building a clean 
government. 
  Provincial Party Committee Secretary Li Changchun presided 
over the forum. Song Guochen, provincial party committee 
standing committee member and provincial discipline inspection 
commission secretary, briefed the participants on Henan's 
on-going anticorruption struggle and future anticorruption plan. 
  Song Guochen said: Since 1993 -- especially since the Second 
Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee 
-- Henan has achieved initial successes in the anticorruption 
struggle under the unified leadership of the Henan Provincial 
CPC Committee. 
  Song Guochen also called for heightening understanding of 
the 
significance of Henan's ongoing anticorruption struggle, 
unswervingly continuing the anticorruption struggle for a long 
time to come, stepping up anticorruption supervision and 
examination work, strictly rooting out the malpractices of 
holding banquets and distributing gifts at public expense during 
the Lunar New Year Festival period, eliminating extravagance and 
waste, reinforcing a restriction mechanism and a supervision 
mechanism, and gradually systematizing anticorruption work and 
placing the work within the orbit of a legal system. [passage 
omitted] 
  Also speaking at the forum were: Ma Ximin, provincial China 
Democratic League committee vice chairman; Wang Liurong and 
Zhang Tao, provincial Jiusan Society committee vice chairmen; Li 
Xuerang, provincial China Democratic National Construction 
Association committee vice chairman; Shao Lingfang and Huang He,

chairman. [passage omitted] 
  After conscientiously listening to the views expressed by 
the 
non-CPC personages, Li Changchun, Song Zhaosu, and other 
provincial leaders spoke one after another at the forum. 
  Comrade Li Changchun said: We should fully understand the 
importance of Henan's ongoing anticorruption struggle, adopt a 
highly responsible attitude to the CPC, never set opposing 
corruption against economic construction, take the ongoing 
anticorruption struggle as a protracted and onerous task, 
unswervingly continue the ongoing anticorruption struggle in an 
in- depth manner for a long time to come, educate cadres to 
enhance their own immunity, build an anticorruption system, 
perfect an anticorruption supervision system, and remove the 
soil on which and the conditions under which corruption takes 
place. 
  Comrade Li Changchun stressed: We sincerely hope that the 
persons in charge of the provincial branches of various 
democratic parties and the provincial industry and commerce 
federation as well as well-known individuals without party 
affiliation will display a spirit of showing utter devotion and 
sharing honor and disgrace, actively put forth constructive 
views on the question of opposing corruption, supervise our 
behavior, and reflect views and demands of the broad masses of 
the people.

  [Text] Provincial Party Committee Secretary Li Changchun 
and provincial Governor Ma Zhongchen held talks at a forum with 
some city mayors and prefectural commissioners attending a 
provincial economic work conference yesterday afternoon. 
Comrade Li Changchun and Comrade Ma Zhongchen also discussed 
with them specific ways and means of deepening reform and 
fulfilling this year's economic tasks. 
  The forum was presided over by provincial vice Governor Fan 
Qinchen and attended by Song Zhaosu, Zhang Honghua, Zhang 
Shiying, Yu Jiahua, Yao Zhongmin, and some other provincial 
leaders. 
  At the forum, city mayors and prefectural commissioners from 
Nanyang Prefecture, Zhumadian Prefecture, Xinyang Prefecture, 
Zhengzhou City, Luoyang City, Kaifeng City, and some other 
cities and prefectures spoke one after another and reported 
their work. They said that they were greatly encouraged by those 
new reform measures promulgated by the state in 1994 but felt 
greater pressure on their work at the same time. They pledged 
to turn such pressure into a motivating force and make a success 
of their work in 1994. 
  At the forum, provincial party committee Secretary Li 
Changchun emphatically called for clearly viewing the situation, 
bracing up, and developing the province's current good 
situation. He said: The year 1994 will be an extraordinary 
year in which we will be confronted with opportunities, 
challenges, hopes, and difficulties. Successfully carrying out 
work in 1994 will lay a solid foundation for us to attain the 
strategic goal of raising Henan's gross national product to a 
level higher than the country's average and lowering Henan's 
population growth rate to a level lower than the country's 
average by the end of the 1990's as well as achieve a 
comparatively well-off standard of living at an earlier date. 
  This year, we should unswervingly adhere to the guiding 
ideology of continually putting forth new ideas, grasping each 
and every excellent opportunity, deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, and accelerating development. We should also 
properly handle relations between reform, development, and 
stability, should regard development as the central task, reform 
as the motive force, and stability as the basis, and should 
firmly concentrate on these three aspects of work. 
  Speaking of development, Li Changchun noted: At present, we 
are being confronted with the major contradiction of slow-paced 
development, this being incompatible with the country's overall 
development. In view of this situation, we should try to 
acquire a thorough understanding of a series of propositions 
made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, such as "development is the last 
word" [fazhan cai shi ying daoli 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 
3810], among others. We should firmly aim at the above-mentioned 
strategic goal and strive to raise Henan's gross national 
product to a level higher than the country's average and lower 
Henan's population growth rate to a level lower than the 
country's average on the basis of an optimized economic 
structure and increased economic efficiency. 
  Li Changchun also called for implementing this strategic 
goal 
to the letter throughout the province by developing famous-brand 
products, focusing on key economic areas, making energetic 
efforts to obtain more state investment, overseas investment, 
and domestic investment, and accelerating Henan's overall 
development. 
  Speaking of reform, Li Changchun pointed out: We should 
consider reform a powerful motive force behind economic growth. 
Henan's practice over the past few years has fully proven that, 
as long as local leaders follow a clear-cut train of thought in 
the course of reform, economic development is bound to 
accelerate in local areas. Reform is a shortcut which will 
enable us to narrow the economic gap between Henan and the rest 
of the country. Therefore, party committees and governments at 
all levels in Henan should concentrate sufficient efforts on 
studying reform, should promote development by virtue of reform, 
should promote opening up by dint of development, and should 
blaze a new trail in the course of development. 
  Speaking of stability, Li Changchun maintained: On one hand, 
we should not simply try to maintain stability for the sake of 
stability and should not refrain from speeding up reform; while, 
on the other, we should understand that, along with the gradual 
deepening of reform, we will surely come across new situations 
and new problems. Thus, we should first try to perfect a social 
security system by focusing on developing insurance businesses 
tailored to the needs of elderly and unemployed people at 
present, should provide proper assistance to staff and workers 
of closed or partially closed enterprises, should provide proper 
assistance to retired enterprise personnel, should tackle the 
problem of the payment of teachers' wages, and should enable the 
broad masses of the people to spend a happy Lunar New Year 
Festival.

  [Excerpts] From 17 to 19 January, provincial party 
Secretary Li Changchun inspected Xiangcheng and Fugou Counties 
in Zhoukou Prefecture. [passage omitted] 
  Secretary Li Changchun made an important speech in which he 
said: In the past year the Zhoukou Prefectural Party Committee 
has done a great deal of work. Practice has proved that this 
prefectural party committee is united and firm, and the 
prefecture has made great progress in economic construction. It 
has registered four first's in the province. First, it was the 
first to break through major and important cases in the combat 
against corruption; second, it was the first to introduce 
foreign capital for Zhoukou City's road construction; third, 
Luyi and Xiangcheng Counties were the first to top [figure 
indistinct] in revenue; fourth, the Huaiyang County Public 
Security Bureau was the first to proceed with crackdowns on 
highway robberies. 
  Li Changchun requested that prefectural party committee 
officials emancipate their minds, change their way of thinking, 
deepen reform, seize the opportunity, boost their morale, and 
profoundly understand Deng Xiaoping's remarks. [passage omitted] 
  He said there was a need to give prominence to the following 
points: The first is enterprise reform; enterprises which are 
operating normally must form a modern enterprise system; loss- 
incurring enterprises must introduce the shareholding system or 
the contract system or allow civilians to run them under state 
ownership. The second is establishing the social insurance 
system. The third is rectifying the market order. The fourth is 
stepping up cadre and personnel system reform. The fifth is 
speeding up housing system reform. The sixth is deepening rural 
reform and developing a diversified economy. 
  Li Changchun demanded that overdue wages for teachers be 
paid 
before the Spring Festival. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, when holding a discussion with 
representatives to a provincial meeting on political science and 
law, provincial party Secretary Li Changchun and Governor Ma 
Zhongchen stressed: All levels of party committees and 
governments should make efforts to maintain social and political 
stability in this new situation. Institutions of political 
science and law should, under the unified leadership of party 
committees and governments, fully display their functions and 
create a stable and political environment for the province's 
reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  After listening to the views of participants from Zhengzhou, 
Luoyang, Xuchang, and Nanyang, Li Changchun said: Doing two 
types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both are 
an important component of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. All levels of party and 
government leaders should properly understand the dialectical 
relations between reform, opening up, economic development, and 
social stability, and improve their understanding on the 
importance of preserving social and political stability. 
  Li Changchun pointed out: Development is the central issue, 
reform is the driving force, and stability is the foundation. 
All levels of party committees and governments should pay full 
attention to political science and law, increase the impetus of 
maintaining social stability, and persist in doing two types of 
work simultaneous and laying equal stress on both in the course 
of deepening reform and stepping up development. 
  Li Changchun continued: All levels of party and government 
leaders should conscientiously carry out the responsibility 
system for comprehensive management of social order. [passage 
omitted] 
  Departments of political science and law throughout the 
province should strengthen their leadership functions, severely 
crack down on all kinds of crimes, and examine and handle major 
and important economic crimes. [passage omitted] 
  During the discussion, Comrade Ma Zhongchen pointed out: All 
levels of party committees and governments should apply the 
method of one divided into two in their work. Comrades on the 
front of political science and law should fully understand the 
difficulties arising from the deepening of reform, the 
adjustment of interests, and the increase in the people's 
contradictions. They should raise their awareness of social 
problems that may possibly arise from the introduction of major 
reform measures. 
  Ma Zhongchen stressed: Comprehensive management of social 
order is a social systems engineering, which should proceed 
under the unified leadership of all-level party committees and 
governments. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zhengzhou, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Central China's 
Henan Province has opened its doors wider to the outside, in a 
bid to attract overseas investment and technology. 
  Now, it has opened 25 cities and 88 counties and established 
ties with over 140 countries and regions. 
  In 1993, the province received over 5,400 foreign guests 
from 
some 60 countries, such as the United States, Japan and Republic 
of Korea. Among them, 220 were important officials who came to 
investigate the investment environment. 
  For example, during his visit, Goh Keng Swee, former 
vice-premier of Singapore, reached tentative agreement with 
relevant departments on several projects involving foodstuffs, 
power and housing industries. 
  So far, 17 cities in the province have sister counterparts 
in 
six countries and regions, such as Australia, Romania and 
Kazakhstan. 
  Their friendly relations are mainly based on economic 
cooperation.

  [Text] Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu delivered a speech 
at a work meeting of the provincial governor and vice governors 
yesterday. 
  In his speech, Chen Bangzhu called on all provincial 
departments and bureaus to conscientiously study, implement, and 
carry out the newly promulgated revenue system, study problems 
cropping up in the course of the new revenue system enforcement, 
and strive to promote a sustained and rapid provincial economic 
growth. 
  Provincial Vice Governor Zhou Bohua also attended the 
meeting 
chaired by provincial Executive Vice Governor Wang Keying. 
  The meeting pointed out: Since being officially enacted on 1 
January, 1994, the new revenue system has been smoothly enforced 
in Hunan Province. Nonetheless, a number of problems have also 
been encountered in this process, including lack of adequate 
measures, uneven tax burdens, and lack of circulating funds 
among enterprises, and so on. 
  In view of the above-mentioned situation, Chen Bangzhu 
stated: In order to secure efficient new revenue system 
enforcement and smooth convergence between the new revenue 
system and the old revenue system, leaders at all levels, 
especially leaders of revenue departments at all levels, should 
exert their utmost to grasp and digest the main spirit of the 
new revenue system, this being a crucial link in providing 
services to enterprises. 
  Chen Bangzhu called on all departments and bureaus concerned 
to set up ad hoc groups that will conscientiously investigate 
and study problems cropping up in the course of the new revenue 
system enforcement and report their findings to the 
administrative departments at higher levels so as to minimize 
friction and collisions in the process of converging the new 
revenue system with the old one. 
  Chen Bangzhu emphatically urged the provincial revenue 
bureau 
to start publicizing the PRC Revenue Law on a large scale, and 
take the initiative to join other provincial departments and 
bureaus concerned in studying and resolving problems in this 
regard. 
  Chen Bangzhu finally called on all trades and professions 
across the province to waste no time in collecting taxes and 
work hard to fulfill revenue quotas upon schedule.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wu Bingyan (0702 0014 3508): "Hunan Sends </F>
10,000 Cadres to Rural Areas To Crack Down on Local Ruffians"] 
  [Text] Hunan provincial CPC committee and provincial 
government decided to launch a province-wide general campaign 
for rectifying the public order in rural areas, concentrating on 
punishing local ruffians. So far, over 10,000 cadres have been 
transferred to rural areas all over the province to participate 
in this operation. By 3 January, the first battle had been 
started in various localities in which 13,415 local ruffians and 
other lawless people were arrested, 8,641 criminal cases of all 
kinds were solved, and 1,572 criminal gangs were smashed, of 
which 6,233 members were pulled out of organized crime. 
  The authorities in Hunan Province have been very determined 
and quick in conducting this general campaign for rectifying the 
public order in rural areas. The chief leaders of party members 
at all levels commanded this operation in person, and 
procuratorial and judicial organs played central roles. Wang 
Maolin, secretary of the provincial party committee, took a 
direct part in organization and planning, contributed to 
discussion and formulation of operation proposals, and 
specifically helped procuratorial and judicial departments solve 
such practical problems as shortages of funds for handling the 
crimes. The authorities of all prefectures, cities, and 
counties set up operation leadership groups headed by the chief 
leaders of party committees and governments and composed of 
personnel from relevant departments. The public security, 
procuratorial, and judicial organs at all levels in the 
province, under the unified leadership of party committees and 
governments, and with close cooperation of relevant departments, 
followed the 13 key targets established in the "Proposal for 
Rectifying Public Order in Rural Areas" transmitted by the 
provincial party committee and provincial government and adopted 
such methods as integrating open investigation with secret 
investigation, integrating information gathering from files with 
solicitation of information from the public, and integrating key 
actions with routine investigations. They conducted in-depth 
investigations and scored good results. 
  In order to consolidate the achievements of the 
rectification 
and strengthen basic work at the grass-roots level, all 
localities in Hunan, in accordance with the requirements of the 
provincial party committee and government, are stepping up the 
selection of public security, procuratorial, and judicial 
cadres, who are in the prime of life, to take up the posts of 
deputy party committee secretaries in townships and towns along 
the railway lines, national highways, and where public security 
is problematic. So far, 300 officers have been picked out and 
put in these posts in the whole province.

  [Text] A provincial personnel work meeting was held from 
13 to 15 January. The meeting pointed out: Under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with a focus on 
economic construction, there is a need to deepen reform, 
strengthen management, enliven human resources, improve 
services, comprehensively fulfill institutional reform, 
introduce the civil service system, and carry out wage system 
reform in order to make new contributions to Hunan's 
invigoration. Provincial party and government leaders, 
including [Vice Governor] Chu Bo and Luo Haifan, attended and 
addressed the meeting. Zhu Qiulin, director of the provincial 
personnel department, made a report entitled "Expediting the 
Pace of Reform, Strengthening Personnel Management, and 
Establishing a Personnel System in Conformity With the Socialist 
Market Economic Structure." 
  In his speech, Chu Bo referred to the province's economic 
situation in 1993, stressed three major aspects of personnel 
reform for this year, and explained the new situation and new 
tasks facing organizational and personnel work. 
  He said: The overall arrangements for institutional reform 
throughout the province were decided by the provincial party 
committee and government last year. These arrangements still 
remain unchanged. The province will strive to fulfill 
institutional reform this year. Before institutional reform is 
carried out, all localities should make the necessary 
preparations. 
  Chu Bo said: Establishing and implementing a state civil 
service system is the focal point of speeding up personnel 
system reform. The provincial government's arrangements are as 
follows: Personnel system reform will be carried out according 
to state regulations, step by step and in a planned way in 
coordination with institutional reform and wage system reform. 
The personnel currently employed throughout the province will 
basically become state civil servants this year. In the course 
of implementing the civil service system, the relevant policy 
should be strictly observed. No one is allowed to introduce 
institutional expansion by taking advantage of this reform, to 
do a rush job of promoting cadres, to increase the number of 
posts for leaders without authorization, or to set up 
nonleadership posts willfully. 
  Comrade Chu Bo also expressed his views on wage system 
reform 
in institutions and stressed the need to reform the social 
insurance system in institutions and enterprises and to 
establish talented personnel markets.

<F P=106> [Report by Liu Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), Central People's </F>
Radio Network reporter, and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Jan (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, gave an important speech 
in Beijing today at the national conference on propaganda and 
ideological work convened by the CPC Central Committee. He 
stressed: Our propaganda and ideological work calls for arming 
our people with scientific theories, guiding them with the 
correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and 
inspiring them with outstanding works so that new generations of 
socialist-minded people who are endowed with lofty ideals, moral 
integrity, a sound education, and a strong sense of discipline 
can be continuously trained and fostered to provide a powerful 
ideological guarantee and to play a supportive role in forming 
public opinion in the great cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Propaganda and ideological work has a 
bearing on the overall situation in our undertaking to build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all 
levels must attach great importance to this task; they must 
strengthen their leadership and earnestly shoulder 
responsibility in this regard. 
  The conference was held at the Great Hall of the People this 
morning. Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding 
Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren 
Jianxin, and other comrades attended the meeting, which was 
presided over by Ding Guangen. 
  Jiang Zemin's speech consisted of three parts: first, the 
importance of strengthening propaganda and ideological work in 
the new period; second, the fundamental principles and main 
tasks of propaganda and ideological work; and third, efforts to 
strengthen and improve the party's leadership over propaganda 
and ideological work. 
  In his speech, Jiang Zemin said: This national conference on 
propaganda and ideological work, which is being held in the 
crucial period of building a socialist market economic structure 
and of the modernization drive in our country, is a meeting of 
overall importance. The main tasks of the meeting are: to 
implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as of the 
party's basic line; and to study and arrange ways and means to 
strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological work in 
accordance with the principle of "simultaneously and strictly 
carrying out two tasks without relaxing efforts to attain either 
of them." 
  Jiang Zemin said: In the current year, the basic policy of 
the work of the whole party is: under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively 
implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, 
as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; to accelerate the building of the socialist market 
economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy; to safeguard political 
stability, and promote all- round social progress. The overall 
mission of the whole party is to seize the opportunity to deepen 
reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, 
and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this 
mission of overall importance, submit to and serve this mission, 
and do a good job in accomplishing the relevant tasks in all 
fields. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: The propaganda and ideological 
front is of immense importance. The history of past decades has 
shown that be it in revolutionary wars or in socialist 
construction, great victories are inseparable from propaganda 
and ideological work. This is a basic experience of our party. 
Attaching great importance to giving full play to the powerful 
role of propaganda and ideological work represents a major 
tradition and a major superior feature of our party. 
  He said: The departments in charge of propaganda and 
ideological work shoulder a vital mission. To sum this up, we 
may say that this mission is to correctly publicize the party's 
theory, line, principles, and policies; and to reflect vividly 
the great practice of the masses, to mobilize all positive 
factors, to turn all negative factors into positive factors, to 
unite all forces that can be united, and to fight to accomplish 
the magnificent goal of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. He pointed out: The new situation has made 
greater demands on the propaganda and ideological front. The 
party's theory, line, principles, and policies need to be 
publicized more penetratingly and widely so that they can be 
understood and grasped by the masses. The series of new 
measures taken by the party and the government to push forward 
reform must be convincingly explained in simple terms to the 
masses. New experiences created by the masses must be summarized 
and popularized; outstanding figures and their lofty spirits 
emerging from all fronts must be eulogized and propagated. The 
masses' increasing demands for spiritual civilization must be 
satisfied through all efforts. The multitude of problems 
arising in practice must be seriously studied and solved; 
ideological conceptual problems pertaining to the readjustment 
of interests which crop up in the course of reform must be 
redressed and resolved; and the negative tendencies prevailing 
in social life must be overcome. Our efforts to push forward 
reform and opening to the outside world and the modernization 
drive require China to better understand the rest of the world 
and the rest of the world to better understand China. All these 
facts point to the importance of propaganda and ideological 
work. We can accomplish great things as long as we pay greater 
attention to various problems, and we must not overlook them in 
any way. We must intensify our efforts and must not slacken 
them one iota; we must keep on improving and upgrading, and we 
must never stand still. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Comrades on the propaganda and 
ideological front have made vigorous efforts and done a 
tremendous amount of work. On the basis of investigation and 
research and after summarizing our experiences and the new 
practices, we have developed a basic idea about carrying out 
propaganda and ideological work in the new situation and have 
further clarified the basic guidelines and principles, as well 
as the primary tasks and work arrangements. Now that the 
general policy guiding propaganda and ideological work has been 
laid down, the key lies in implementation, in doing our work in 
a down-to-earth manner, and in continuing to summarize our 
practical experience and to advance in a pioneering spirit. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the 
fundamental principle guiding all party work. The propaganda 
and ideological front must firmly adhere to this basic guideline 
and use it as the guide for all of its work. Only by doing so 
can we ensure a correct orientation in propaganda and 
ideological work and the successful accomplishment of all our 
tasks. All party comrades, especially leading comrades at all 
levels and those engaged in propaganda and ideological work, 
must earnestly study Comrade Xiaoping's works, further enhance 
their consciousness and determination in carrying out propaganda 
and ideological work, and strive to use what they have learned 
in practical work. 
  He said: The propaganda and ideological front is an extended 
front shouldering arduous tasks. It must uphold the ideological 
line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, 
earnestly carry out its work in all fields by focusing on the 
central task of economic construction, and actively push forward 
the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization. 
At present and for some time to come, we must pay special 
attention to the work in four respects. First, the most 
important task of the propaganda and ideological front is to arm 
the minds of all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Party committees at all levels must earnestly organize and 
guide party members and cadres to study this theory. While 
continuing to successfully hold seminars for principal leaders 
at the provincial and ministerial level, we will train within 
two to three years, by groups and in stages, all cadres with 
party membership at and above the county and regimental level. 
We must make full use of the press, radio, television, 
publications, and other media to publicize this theory 
thoroughly. We must bring into play in studying this theory the 
backbone role of the five research centers established by the 
Central Party School, the State Education Commission, the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the People's Liberation Army 
National Defense University, and the Shanghai Academy of Social 
Sciences. Second, we must persist in implementing the party's 
basic line and in properly guiding public opinion. Persisting 
in properly guiding public opinion means creating a type of 
public opinion conducive to further reform and opening up and to 
the establishment of a socialist market economy and the 
development of social productive forces. It means creating a 
kind of public opinion that helps strengthen the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal 
system; that encourages and inspires people to make arduous 
efforts and to blaze a new trail for the country's prosperity, 
people's well-being, and social progress; that helps people 
distinguish between right and wrong, uphold truth, good, and 
beauty, and resist falsehood, evil, and ugliness; that promotes 
national reunification and unity; and that helps to bring peace 
of mind to the people and social and political stability. 
Third, we must strengthen ideological work to bring up a new 
generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with 
lofty ideals and moral integrity. We must strengthen 
ideological and ethical education centering on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism; carry out education in the spirit 
of plain living and hard struggle, and the principle of building 
the country through thrift and diligence; and carry out 
education on professional and social ethics and on national 
conditions. We must do a good job of mass ideological work. 
Fourth, we must adhere to the course of serving the people and 
socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, foster the 
main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and 
art. Upholding the principles of serving the people and 
socialism and letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred 
schools of thought contend are basic requirements for producing 
spiritual works and an important guarantee for the prosperity of 
propaganda and cultural undertakings. Fostering the main theme 
and advocating diversification reflect in a concrete way the 
orientation of serving the people and socialism and the 
principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred 
schools of thought contend. Fostering the main theme means, 
under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and of the party's basic line, 
vigorously advocating ideas and spirits conducive to fostering 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; conducive to reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization; conducive to national 
unity, social progress, and the people's well-being; and 
conducive to seeking a happy life through honest labor. 
  Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: In the course of 
carrying out propaganda and cultural work and promoting 
socialist spiritual civilization, it is necessary to give 
priority to social benefit [she hui xiao yi 4357 2585 2400 
4135]. Under this basic precondition, we must integrate 
economic returns with social benefit. It is important that we 
build spiritual civilization and strengthen its management. 
  In discussing strengthening and exercising effective party 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work, Jiang Zemin 
said: We must solemnly place the question of giving equal 
emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both before the whole 
party; we must place this question high on the agenda of party 
committees at all levels. We should make it clear that the 
responsibility for a region's or department's propaganda and 
ideological work and progress in promoting spiritual 
civilization lies primarily with its party committee. Party 
committees at all levels, and their principal officials in 
particular, must conduct in-depth research and investigation, 
sum up experience, and improve propaganda and ideological work. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Building a contingent of cadres who are 
upright, well versed in policy, and professionally competent to 
implement propaganda and ideological work. The key to 
strengthening the building of this contingent of cadres lies in 
successfully building its leading body. Party committees at all 
levels should demonstrate concern for such a contingent in terms 
of politics, ideology, operations, and material benefits and do 
a good job in building such a contingent. We must 
conscientiously implement the policy of respecting knowledge and 
talent, bring into full play the intelligence and wisdom of the 
vast number of intellectuals on this front, and do our best to 
bring up in force experts in all fields who will make an impact 
at home or even internationally. As for those making 
outstanding contributions, we especially care for and treasure 
them. 
  He said: We must treat comrades on this front with 
understanding and support. We should passionately help them sum 
up experience and encourage them to go down to the grass-roots 
levels, to go deep among the masses, and to go into the 
realities of life so that they can draw nourishment from the 
creative and history-making activities of the masses to 
replenish and improve themselves. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: There is a large collection 
of men of talent on the propaganda and ideological front. The 
vast number of comrades on the propaganda and ideological front 
are loyal to the cause of the party and the people. The Central 
Committee trusts them and the party and people have high 
expectations of them. It is hoped that all of us will, under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, work vigorously to make the 
country prosperous, keep forging ahead with all our energy, and 
make every effort to raise propaganda and ideological work to 
new heights. 
  Present at the conference were responsible comrades and 
propaganda department directors of party committees of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government, and responsible comrades in charge of 
propaganda and ideological work from the various central 
departments and committees. 
  Also present at the conference were comrades attending the 
working conference of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of 
Radio, Film, and Television; the State Council Information 
Office, the State Press and Publications Administration, the 
General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, 
and RENMIN RIBAO, the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, and other departments 
and units.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng 
today urged Chinese Communist Party committees and governments 
at all levels to strengthen their leadership over ideological 
and media work, and promote the prosperity and development of 
cultural services. 
  Addressing a national conference on ideological and media 
work, the premier said: "The development of the international 
and domestic situations has provided very good conditions for 
improving our ideological and media work, and has also set still 
higher requirements on it." 
  Li, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political 
Bureau of the party Central Committee, expounded four topics: 
the international situation and the conduct of China's foreign 
affairs; China's economic growth; the reform of the country's 
economic structures; and hopes on ideological and media work. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the party Central 
Committee, elaborated in his speech at the opening session of 
the conference the position and role of the ideological and 
media work during the current new period. 
  Jiang also spelled out the fundamental guiding principles 
and 
major tasks for ideological and media work. 
  Premier Li Peng asked all ideological and media departments 
to conscientiously implement the spirit of Jiang's speech and to 
do their work still better. 
  Speaking of the current international situation and the 
conduct of China's foreign affairs, he said that China has made 
great progress in relations with other countries by pursuing the 
independent policy of peace. 
  Having analyzed Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-West European 
relations, as well as friendly and cooperative relations between 
China and its neighboring countries and other developing 
countries, the premier said that overall, the current 
international situation has provided a favorable external 
environment for China to promote its reform, opening-up and 
economic development. 
  The leader stressed that China is now in a period of 
development rarely seen in history. 
  With a favorable international situation and good domestic 
conditions, he said, it is entirely possible for China to strive 
to achieve a "sustainable, fast-speed and healthy" growth of 
national economy for a fairly long time to come. 
  According to Li Peng, the principle governing China's 
economic work in 1994 is to implement the spirit of the party's 
14th national congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
Central Committee, take major steps in establishing a socialist 
market economic set-up, open still wider to the outside world, 
strengthen and improve macro-economic controls, readjust the 
economic structure, promote technological progress, improve 
economic efficiency, and maintain sustained, fast-speed and 
healthy growth of the national economy. 
  To this end, it is imperative to exp!nd the rural economy, 
invigorate major state-owned enterprises, and strengthen and 
improve macro-economic controls, he said. 
  On restructuring China's economy, Premier Li Peng said that 
the central tasks for this year are to establish a sound 
macro-economic control system, with focus on taxation system and 
finance, push ahead with price reforms in a steady manner and 
estaBlish a modern enterprise system that tallies with the 
socialist market economic structure. 
  He called for efforts to handle well the relations among 
reform, development and stability, saying that economic 
development is the focus of all work while reform provides the 
powerful motive force to social and economic development and 
stability is the prerequisite for development and reform. 
  He urged active but cautious steps to promote reform and 
make 
substantial progress in key areas by seizing the opportune 
moment. 
  The Chinese premier said that the Communist Party of China 
is 
competent in doing ideological and media work, which provides 
support to and ensures the success of revolution and economic 
development. 
  He expressed the hope that units doing ideological work and 
the mass media,which have played an important roLe in reform and 
opening and modernization drive, would provide a correct guide 
to the public opinion and better serve the country's efforts of 
reform, opening and modernization. 
  He stressed that news coverage must be complete, objective 
and accurate and must guard against one-sidedness. 
  Li Peng urged the government departments at all levels to 
attach importance to and support those doing ideological work 
and mass media, provide them with necessary working conditions 
and help solve their real difficulties. 
  Present at the conference were Zhu Rongji, Ding Guangen, Li 
Lanqing, Li Tieying, Qian Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao and 
Ren Jianxin.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Tao </F>
(2621 3447) and XINHUA reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking today at the 
Central Party School's commencement ceremonies, Hu Jintao, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, and 
president of the Central Party School, pointed out: In 
accelerating the pace of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, we should, on the one hand, promote the 
spirit of advancing despite difficulties and working 
unflaggingly in order to firmly push forward reform. On the 
other hand, we should adopt a rigorous, realistic, and 
scientific attitude, proceed from reality, and promptly uncover 
and solve salient problems as we move forward. 
  Attending the commencement ceremonies were 1,964 students 
from the Central Party School's 21st advanced studies class for 
cadres at the prefectural and departmental levels, the school's 
theoretical department, and its branches at the CPC Central 
Committee's Work Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central 
Committee's Work Committee for Government Organs, and military 
units. 
  After fully affirming the students' academic achievements, 
Hu 
Jintao pointed out: The year 1994 is very crucial to our 
country's future process of reform and development. This year's 
tasks are heavy and arduous. We must strengthen leadership, 
consider the overall situation, and mobilize all positive 
factors to ensure the implementation of various major central 
policy decisions. He pointed out: A major issue to which the 
entire party, especially leading cadres at all levels, must 
attach importance, and which it must endeavor to solve, is how 
to maintain rapid and good development of the national economy 
and ensure the smooth implementation of all reform measures 
while safeguarding political stability. 
  In his speech, Hu Jintao said emphatically: We should 
strengthen ideological and political work in the course of 
reform to provide a spiritual driving force and an ideological 
guarantee of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure. He said: Leading cadres 
at all levels must carry forward the party's fine tradition and 
work style, go deep among the masses, carry out mass propaganda, 
and address and solve thorny and intensely discussed problems of 
common concern to the people. Along with the introduction of 
major reform measures, we should concentrate on carrying out 
propaganda and explanatory work and on guiding public opinion in 
order to dispel people's misgivings, defuse contradictions, and 
mobilize the broad masses of people to support and participate 
in reform. We should integrate ideological and political work 
with the solution of people's practical problems, foster close 
ties with the masses, listen to their views, understand popular 
sentiment, show concern for people's sufferings, base our 
actions on the masses, and strive to tailor our policy decisions 
and measures to the wishes of the broad masses of the people. 
Furthermore, we should foster correct ideals, beliefs, and 
values, and vigorously promote the arduous pioneering spirit of 
the new period, in all segments of society, especially among the 
younger generation. 
  Hu Jintao also expressed his views on the questions of 
thoroughly studying and mastering Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; correctly 
handling the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability; and earnestly strengthening and improving party 
building. In closing, he expressed the hope that the students 
would take their group studies in the Central Party School as a 
new starting point from which to improve their on-the-job 
studies, form the good habit of studying hard and thinking 
deeply, apply constantly what they have learned to the practice 
of reform and modernization, conduct investigations and studies, 
sum up their experiences and improve their work, and enhance 
their capacity for studying new circumstances and solving new 
problems. 
  Wang Jialiu, executive vice president of the Central Party 
School, chaired the commencement ceremonies. Attending the 
ceremonies were Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, and responsible 
individuals from relevant departments such as Zhao Zongnai, Liu 
Yunshan, Zheng Keyang, Chen Fujin, Lu Shiche, Wang Yiping, Su 
Xing, Xing Bensi, and Liu Shengyu.

Guojun (7482 0948 7486): "Li Lanqing Inspects Zhejiang, 
Stressing Need for Cadres at All Levels To Meticulously Organize 
To Ensure Smooth Progress of Reform"] 
  [Text] "The series of major economic reform measures 
promulgated this year are important steps toward the goal of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure laid down at 
the 14th national party congress. Reform is currently in a 
stage of overcoming the strategic barrier. We must pay special 
attention to social stability. We must stabilize commodity 
prices, successfully combat corruption, promote clean 
government, and control investment in fixed assets to create a 
favorable external environment for reform. Local authorities 
must carry out meticulous organization and study, promptly 
resolve new problems appearing in the course of reform, reduce 
risks, and work with one heart and one mind to ensure the smooth 
progress of reform." This statement was repeatedly and 
emphatically made by Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau 
of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State 
Council, during his recent inspection tour of Zhejiang. 
  From 4 to 7 January, Li Lanqing, accompanied by Secretary Li 
Zemin of the Zhejiang provincial party committee and Governor 
Wan Xueyuan, inspected Zhejiang to find out about its grain and 
edible oil prices, market supply, education reform, and fight 
against smuggling. 
  During his stay in Zhejiang, Li Lanqing made a special point 
of hearing the work report of Zhejiang's provincial party 
committee and government. He pointed out: Zhejiang's general 
situation is very good. The province has made notable progress 
in its work in all areas. Achievements in its economic 
relations and trade with foreign countries are particularly 
impressive, with a growth rate among the highest in the nation. 
It is very hopeful that the goal of achieving a level of 
comfortable living may be attained ahead of schedule. 
  After an in-depth investigation, study, and tour of 
Hangzhou, 
Shaoxing, and Ningbo cities, Li Lanqing said: With the 
promulgation of new measures for comprehensive reform, we must 
pay particular attention to inflation. The key here is to 
control price changes within a range tolerable to the broad 
masses. There has been quite a large fluctuation in the price 
of grain, edible oil, and vegetable. The State Council has 
adopted a number of measures to cope with it. Localities should 
also sacrifice some of their immediate, partial interests and 
adopt macroeconomic regulation and control to bring to a 
reasonable level the prices of commodities closely related to 
the daily life of the masses, thereby creating a stable social 
environment for reform. 
  Li Lanqing said: In the course of developing the economy, we 
must not blindly build development zones. In building approved 
development zones, we must pay attention to integrating them 
with the renovation of old cities and enterprises. In building 
small towns in rural areas, we must coordinate their planning 
with the development of a type of farming that provides high 
yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency, and with the 
second take-off of our rural work. We must guard against 
decrease in agricultural output and safeguard the development of 
"vegetable basket project." As long as we have abundant 
agricultural produce and sideline products, we will not be 
thrown into panic, and things will be easier to handle. 
  During his inspection, Li Lanqing visited Hangzhou's 
Moganshan Vocational High School, Xuejun Middle School, Hangzhou 
University, and Zhejiang University, as well as held a 
discussion meeting on educational reform with responsible 
persons of 22 institutes of higher learning. 
  Li Lanqing asked leading cadres at all levels to truly 
enhance their understanding on "respecting teachers and 
attaching importance to education." He said: Educational work 
was discussed rather comprehensively and thoroughly in 27 
chapters in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. We should earnestly study, understand, and 
practice the teaching. The saying "education is fundamental for 
a program of lasting importance" should not be taken as merely 
an empty slogan, but should be used for mobilizing the entire 
party, society, and people to show concern, support, and 
participation in educational undertakings. Li Lanqing expressed 
his appreciation to Zhejiang provincial party committee for its 
decision "not to delay payment of teachers' salaries and not to 
issue IOU's to farmers." 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: Further upgrading teaching quality 
and school efficiency are the two key issues in current reform 
for higher education. Speaking on the placement of institutes 
of higher learning on the "211" project, he stressed: It is not 
necessary to rush into making an evaluation as this is a 
development process. Apart from standards stipulated by the 
State Education Commission, institutes of higher learning should 
meet the following three criteria: First, institutes of higher 
learning of any province (city) that has not implemented basic 
education efficiently or not even paid teachers' salaries cannot 
be placed on the "211" project. Second, institutes of higher 
learning that have not undertaken major reform measures cannot 
be placed on the "211" project. Third, institutes of higher 
education should be encouraged to supplement one another with 
their strengths and jointly establish the "211" project. 
  While holding a discussion meeting in Ningbo, Li Lanqing 
spoke predominantly on vocational education. He said: While 
implementing educational reform, we should ask the people not to 
merely seek a higher college entrance rate and advise students 
not to confine themselves anymore to the difficult path of 
seeking entrance to colleges. We shoud advise them to embark on 
vocational education, a "broad and sunny avenue" which will 
provide them with equal opportunities to become qualified 
personnel and contribute to society. He expressed the hope 
that, through the development of vocational education, Ningbo 
City would actively explore a new avenue for training qualified 
personnel urgently needed in economic development and reform and 
opening up. He was pleased at Ningbo City's efforts in 
implementing the "Teachers' Law" and active research in measures 
for solving teachers' housing problem. He encouraged the city 
to make a resolution on accomplishing its tasks effectively. 
  On the issue of compulsory education in rural areas, Li 
Lanqing stressed the need to work out a comprehensive program to 
incorporate agricultural science and technology into the 
nine-year compulsory education so as to train a new generation 
of peasants who are better educated than their parents. During 
his inspection of Zhejiang, Li Lanqing also called on customs 
office employees in Hangzhou. He told them: The Zhejiang 
provincial party committee and government have paid keen 
attention to, and followed a correct ideological line in 
understanding antismuggling work. From now on we should 
strengthen ideological education on the need to crack down on 
smuggling among the grass-roots cadres. We should tackle 
smuggling in the light of fighting corruption and promoting 
clean government, and should teach grass-roots cadres to develop 
local economy and achieve prosperity through earnest operation, 
not by engaging in smuggling. 
  Li Lanqing said: We have already checked the spread of the 
evil wave of smuggling, and the country as a whole is relatively 
quiet. However, we should never lower our guard. Antismuggling 
is a protracted task. It is necessary to persistently and 
relentlessly crack down on smuggling activities once they are 
discovered. Meanwhile, we should strive to achieve periodic 
results in fighting smuggling in various fields: 1) we should 
raise the awareness of antismuggling among leaders and ordinary 
people alike; 2) we should resolutely curb smuggling and trading 
of smuggled goods; 3) we should step up efforts to investigate 
and punish major and serious cases; and 4) all departments 
concerned should coordinate with each other to improve 
comprehensive management. Efforts should be made to resolutely 
implement the principle of "on-the-spot arrests, coastal 
blockade, road checks, market supervision, and severe 
punishment" in dealing with smuggling activities and smugglers. 
  In conclusion, Li Lanqing said: As the reform has entered a 
crucial stage in all fields, all localities should study issues 
related to the change of operational guidelines and mechanisms 
of commercial circulation and foreign trade enterprises. 
State-owned commercial departments should develop a commercial 
chain system comprising both enterprise groups and wholesale and 
retail businesses. It is necessary to actively experiment with 
the modern enterprise system among foreign trade enterprises in 
a bid to strengthen their cohesive power, intiate perfect 
incentive and supervisory systems, prevent the drain of talented 
people, ensure more foreign exchange earning, and increase 
economic efficiency, thereby enabling the foreign trade industry 
to keep abreast of the development of a socialist market economy 
as quickly as possible.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Xin Yan (2621 2450 1750) and RENMIN </F>
RIBAO reporter Hu Yueping (5170 6460 1627)] 
  [Text] Guiyang, 16 Jan (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
investigation and study tour of Guizhou, Li Tieying, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, state councillor, 
and minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring 
Commission, emphatically said that as China has entered a new 
period of accelerating reform and economic development, it is 
necessary to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in 
light of realities in Guizhou, have a profound understanding of 
the blueprint and overall framework adopted at the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and try to carry them 
out by emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and 
undertaking bold exploration so as to find out a way to 
prosperity which is practical to the people of an inland 
prov)nce. 
  Li Tieying went to Guizhou to conduct investigation and 
study 
from 12 to 15 January. He went down to such grass-roots units 
as plants, rural areas, grain depots, and development zones in 
Zunyi, Anshun, Guiyang, and other places to understand 
conditions there. He also held discussion meetings with 
responsible persons of provincial party committee, government, 
and departments concerned. He fully affirmed the results 
achieved by Guizhuo province since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPCCentral Committee. He said: Tremendous changes have 
occurred in Guizhou over the past 15 year of reform. In 1987, 
it doubled its industrial and agricultural output value. It is 
expected that the province will redouble its industrial and 
agricultural output in 1996 so as to enable it, an inland 
province with protracted backwardness in economy, to make 
remarkable progress. This is a result of long-term struggle of 
34 million people of all nationalities under the leadership of 
provincial party committee and government. He expressed his 
hopes that Guizhou will continue to emancipate the mind, 
undertake bold exploration, and further accelerate the pace of 
reform and opening to the outside world. 
  After reviewing the course of China's reform and opening up 
to the outside world in the past 15 years and also summing up 
China's experiences in this respect, Li Tieying pointed out: 
Whenever a locality has done a good job in emancipating its 
mind, it will do well in reform and development. There may be 
differences in geographical environment, natural resources, and 
the pace of economic development between the hinterland 
provinces and the coastal areas, but there should not be 
differences in matters of emancipating the mind, changing old 
concepts, and seeking truth from facts. He who has emancipated 
his mind will be able to proceed from reality to understand the 
conditions in a province and a region, as well as the conditions 
of the masses, will cast away many ideological shackles and 
conventions, will draw on the experiences of developed areas, 
and create new experiences in line with reality, thereby 
fundamentally reforming the old system that has prevented the 
development of the productive forces and promoting local 
economic development. Various major reform measures will be 
introduced this year. I hope the provincial party committee and 
the provincial government will study them carefully and ensure 
their meticulous and smooth implementation. 
  Li Tieying stressed: Our reform tasks are extremely arduous. 
They will not only bring pressure but also provide us with 
opportunities. The hinterland provinces should be good at 
seizing the opportunities, make good use of their advantages, 
deepen the reform, open wider to the outside world, and 
accelerate economic development. He said: Although Guizhou is 
not situated along the Chang Jiang, the coast, and the border, 
it has, what Premier Zhou Enlai used to praise, beautiful 
mountains and rivers, pleasant weather, rich natural resources, 
and hard working people. Although Guizhou is the only 
agricultural province without a plain, 97 percent of its hilly 
areas possess rich resources. It should make great efforts to 
exploit resources from its hilly areas. Li Tieying expressed 
great interest in Guizhou's rich mineral and energy resources 
and its unique tourism resources formed by its beautiful typical 
karst landform and strong ethnic flavor. After inspecting the 
Anshun Wax Printing General Plant, he spoke highly of wax 
printing, a manual printing technology employed by the ethnic 
minorities since ancient times. In a happy mood he wrote an 
inscription which reads: "The flower of art has lasted thousands 
of years, while the ethnic treasure is still surprisingly 
beautiful." He expressed the hope that Guizhou's wax printing 
will be quickly made into colorful serial products to be 
marketed domestically and internationally. 
  In discussing the reform of the administrative system for 
grain, Li Tiying said: It is necessary to pay close attention 
to and be cautious in the reform of this system. This reform 
should be regarded as a major reform and should be carefully 
studied. At present, what is most important is to do everything 
possible to stabilize grain prices and to make concerted efforts 
to ensure a bumper harvest this year. 
  As the Spring Festival is approaching, Li Tiying expressed 
the hope that the governments and departments at all levels will 
carefully make arrangements for market supply in order to enable 
the masses, particularly those in poor areas, to enjoy a happy 
Spring Festival.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The National Conference 
of Heads of Religious Bureaus opened today in Beijing. 
Attending the meeting were some 100 people from religious 
departments in provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities, and responsible comrades from relevant CPC 
Central Committee and state organs. 
  State Councillor Ismail Amat spoke at the meeting. He said: 
Correct handling of religious affairs and doing a good job are 
an important part of building the great cause of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, which has an important significance in 
maintaining social stability; enhancing national unity; and 
promoting reform and opening up. Reform and opening up bring 
great changes to society and to the people's spiritual outlook, 
and provide a favorable social environment for doing a good job 
in religious affairs. At present, religious affairs work faces 
many new situations and problems. To do a good job under the 
new situation, it is necessary to seriously study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; to resolutely implement guidelines set forth at 
the 14th CPC National Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; to incorporate the party's basic 
line into the real practice of religious affairs work; and to 
handle various day-to-day religious affairs work in strict 
accordance with the state's relevant laws, regulations, and 
policies. At the same time, it is necessary to attach great 
importance to unity in religious affairs work. We must forge 
unity between the masses of believers and nonbelievers, between 
the masses of different religions, and among those who believe 
in the same religion; we must be united, be of one heart and one 
mind, strive for common progress, and for building a modern 
socialist state. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of 
the United Front Work Department under the CPC Central 
Committee, and deputy secretary general of the State Council Xi 
Dehua attended today's plenary session. Zhang Shengzuo, 
director of the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs, 
delivered a work report; deputy director Chi Nai presided over 
the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 26 KYODO -- Eighteen people were 
sentenced to death for crimes ranging from murder to robbery and 
rape, as violent crimes in China's capital continue to increase 
as the economy develops, Chinese state press reported Tuesday 
[25 January]. 
  According to the BEIJING DAILY [BEIJING RIBAO], the 18 were 
sentenced by the Beijing Intermediate Court on Monday in what is 
believed to be one of the largest instances in Beijing of a 
group of convicted criminals receiving death sentences in recent 
memory. 
  Twelve of those sentenced will appeal while the other six 
were executed immediately, the paper said. 
  Many of those sentenced were unemployed or outsiders who had 
migrated to the capital, while five of the convicted were part 
of a group which committed several armed robberies in 1991-92, 
the paper said.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhu Jiahua [2612 1367 
5478], director of the Public Security Administrative Bureau of 
the Ministry of Public Security [name and title as received], 
said today that the current condition of social order in the 
vast majority of localities throughout the country is fine 
[liang hao 5328 1170], except for a few. 
  Not long ago, an assessment and review carried out by the 
relevant authorities on the conditions of social order in 
various localities substantiates Director Zhu Jiahua's 
evaluation. Results of the assessment and review show that, 
while social order in 67 percent of over 1,700 counties 
nationwide is good, 20 percent and 4 percent have been 
classified as general [yi ban 0001 5301] and not good [bu hao 
0008 1170], respectively. 
  This information was disclosed by Zhu Jiahua at a discussion 
meeting held at the Ministry of Public Security today. He said: 
To improve social order, the integration of the professionalism 
of public security organs and work relating to mass relations is 
necessary, under which the public security organs, while 
intensifying the crackdown on crime, should improve services for 
the masses. 
  About a dozen people, including Shen Zui [3088 6816], a 
member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; Jiang Kun [1203 2492], a 
renowned comic actor; Fei Lulu [6316 6424 6424], president of 
the China Youth Education Research Center; responsible persons 
of enterprises; and heads of Neighborhood Offices, attended the 
discussion meeting, and contributed suggestions and ideas to 
help public security organs improve social order.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- China is taking a 
series of vigorous measures to boost employment of former 
convicts, so as to give them equal opportunities to work. 
  Preferential policies will be granted to short-term firms 
which mainly employ ex-convicts, according to a senior official 
of the Labor Ministry. 
  Those enterprises will be entitled to priorities and 
government support in terms of loans, sites, bidding, as well as 
leasing of other firms, said Zhang Xiaojian, director of the 
ministry's Employment Department, in an exclusive interview with 
XINHUA here today. 
  The move highlights China's bid to care for ex-convicts -- 
in 
work and living conditions -- and it will also help to maintain 
social stability. The Chinese Government has always urged that 
ex- convicts should be provided equal opportunities in 
employment. 
  Zhang stressed that on no account should any enterprise 
discriminate against ex-convicts in employment, adding that 
those which violate the regulations will be prosecuted. 
  According to Zhang, China has established a unified and 
coordinated system in creating jobs for ex-convicts, including 
job- training and unemployment insurance provided for them. 
  China has already achieved marked results in this endeavor, 
said the official. On average, over 90 percent of the 
ex-convicts in Beijing are employed every year. In the cities 
of Shanghai and Guangzhou, the employment rates of ex-convicts 
are 64 percent and 72 percent respectively.

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Seventh Provincial 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] opened in Guiyang yesterday afternoon. 
Provincial CPPCC Chairman Long Zhiyi chaired the session. 
[passage omitted] 
  Provincial Party Secretary Liu Fangren made an important 
speech at the opening ceremony. 
  [Begin Liu recording] Today, at a time when people of 
various nationalities throughout the province are 
comprehensively implementing the instructions of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and are emancipating their minds, seeking 
truth from facts, widening the opening up scope, and seizing the 
opportunity to expedite their development, the Second Session of 
the Seventh Provincial CPPCC Committee has opened in Guizhou. 
On behalf of the Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee, I extend my 
warm congratulations to this session and my kind regards to all 
CPPCC members and comrades present here. 
  The year of 1994 will be the first year to comprehensively 
implement the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee as well as the first year to 
comprehensively implement all the tasks set by the Seventh 
Provincial CPC Congress. To fulfill this year's tasks, the 
provincial party committee has explicitly proposed that, under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line, we should implement the instructions of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, focus on economic construction, further 
emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, expedite reform, 
widen opening up, boost our morale, work in a down-to-earth 
manner, and promote the province's socialist market economy, 
party building, spiritual civilization, and the formation of the 
democratic and legal system. [passage omitted] 
  We should correctly handle the relations between reform, 
development, and stability and unite people of all nationalities 
throughout the province in preserving and developing the 
political situation characterized by stability and unity. To 
provide a good social and political environment, we should do 
two types of work simultaneously, lay equal stress on both, and 
carry forward socialist spiritual civilization. All this has 
set higher demands on the provincial CPPCC this year. 
  In this year, CPPCC organizations at all levels throughout 
the province should conscientiously study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, profoundly implement the instructions of the 
14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, conscientiously carry out all the 
tasks set by the Seventh Provincial CPC Congress, uphold the 
party's basic line, further abide by and improve the CPC-led 
multiparty cooperative and political consultative system, and 
raise the province's patriotic united front work to a new level. 
[passage omitted] 
  In cooperation with the relevant departments, the CPPCC 
organizations at all levels throughout the province should do a 
good job in accommodating overseas friends who come to Guizhou 
for family visits, sight-seeing, and trade discussions; should 
promote scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges with 
foreign countries; and should encourage more friends to invest 
in Guizhou. They should tell potential investors about the 
party's policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two 
systems and should describe for them the province's scenic spots 
and the people's habits and customs to expand our influence. 
[passage omitted] 
  CPPCC organizations at all levels should conscientiously 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, should study and implement the party's line, 
policies, and principles, should further improve their 
ideological and theoretical level, should improve their ability 
to participate in the deliberation of state affairs, and should 
make greater contributions to the province's two civilizations. 
  All levels of party committees and governments should 
further 
improve their understanding of the CPPCC's nature, position, and 
mission, should seriously implement the CPC-led multiparty 
cooperative and political consultative system, and should 
vigorously support and propagate the CPPCC, political 
consultative, and democratic supervisory systems. [passage 
omitted] 
  Party committees at all levels should strengthen their 
leadership over CPPCC organizations -- first and foremost their 
political leadership over CPPCC organizations. CPPCC 
organizations at all levels should carry out their work 
according to the party's line, principles, and policies by 
focusing on economic construction and the work of party's 
committees and governments. All levels of party committees and 
governments should solicit the opinions of CPPCC organizations, 
democratic parties, mass organizations, and nonparty patriotic 
individuals. The relevant departments should seriously handle 
important suggestions and criticism raised by CPPCC 
organizations and nonparty individuals. Difficulties that CPPCC 
members encounter in work and life should be resolved with every 
possible effort. [end recording]

  [Text] Yesterday provincial party committee and government 
leaders including Xie Shijie, Xiao Yang, Pu Haiqing, Diao 
Jinxiang, and Xu Shiqun took part in discussions with People's 
Congress deputies from armed forces units stationed in Sichuan, 
Mianyang, Zigong, Leshan, Guangan, and Nanchong. They carefully 
listened to the deputies' views. 
  In a group discussion held by the Aba autonomous prefectural 
delegation, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie said that the 
province must never miss opportunities in the 1990's, otherwise 
Sichuan will suffer serious losses. After listening to some 
deputies' remarks, Xie Shijie said: The difficulties of the 
three minority autonomous prefectures and remote areas have 
received the close attention of the provincial party committee 
and government, and we are now discussing methods and measures 
with every one of you to resolve them. But the efforts of the 
central and provincial authorities alone cannot help completely 
resolve problems. I would like to quote Deng Xiaoping: 
Development is a fixed principle. In time of financial 
difficulties, you should not compete with other prefectures but 
should find ways suitable for yourselves. You can encourage 
individual and private economic sectors to development township 
and town enterprises with a free mind. The three autonomous 
prefectures have strong points in resources and should pay 
attention to the commodity economy. 
  On economic development in ethnic prefectures, Xiao Yang 
said 
in a group discussion of the Ganzi autonomous prefectural 
delegation: Let us develop methods together, but to develop the 
economy is a fixed principle. In economic development, the 
three autonomous prefectures can rely on Chengdu and Chongqing. 
The provincial authorities are seeking ways for this to help 
ethnic prefectures with their development. 
  Vice Governor Xu Shiqun attended a group discussion on 
education held by the Nanchong delegation. He listened to the 
deputies' views on government educational work. Xu Shiqun 
said: In making an economic leap, Sichuan must hold firm to the 
orientation of socialist education, give prominence to primary 
education, and make a success of the nine-year compulsory 
education. But some localities have not put this into effect. 
I hope every one of you will supervise this. There are still 
some problems to resolve in education, such as inadequate 
investment in education and low salaries for teachers. Now 
detailed regulations are being worked out for the implementation 
of the Teachers Law. In the future, the improvement of the 
teachers ranks will proceed under the legal system. 
  While holding a group discussion with the Deyang delegation 
yesterday afternoon, Provincial People's Congress Chairman Yang 
Xizong and Governor Xiao Yang pointed out the need to resolve 
new problems emerging in the course of development. After 
listening to the remarks of some People's Congress deputies on 
the peasants' difficulties in selling their products due to an 
imperfect market mechanism, Yang Xizong expressed his full 
concern by saying: How to guide the peasants into the market is 
a new issue in the course of development and is also a problem 
we should work hard to resolve in our future rural economic 
development. First, we should do a good job in providing market 
forecasts and guide the peasants in arranging their production 
according to market information. Second, we should form an 
entity of trade, industry, and agriculture and improve all kinds 
of service in coordination with this. Third, we should 
establish a reserve system and a risk-bearing fund. 
  A deputy named Li Yongshou said that because tax evasions 
are 
serious, Deyang City is ready to form a local taxation bureau. 
After hearing this, Xiao Yang remarked: This is very good, tax 
evasions must be resolved. You can work out a plan to form the 
bureau as soon as possible.

  [Text] Chengdu, January 26 (XINHUA) -- China's biggest 
meat futures exchange will be opened in April this year in this 
capital of Sichuan, a major pork producing province in southwest 
China. 
  The exchange, sponsored by the Ministry of Internal Trade 
and 
the Sichuan provincial government, will admit domestic and 
overseas enterprises, brokerage companies and financial 
institutions as members for a fee of 200,000 yuan (about 23,000 
U.S. dollars). The transactions will be managed by public 
bidding with the aid of computers. 
  China's biggest wholesale meat market was set up in Chengdu 
in October 1991. So far, the volume of business totals 1.368 
million tons, worth 6.61 billion yuan. 
  However, officials in charge of the market said meat futures 
need separate handling to stabilize prices and reduce the risks 
to pork producers.

  [Text] Chengdu, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Inland Sichuan 
Province in southwest China is attracting more capital from 
Taiwan, according to government sources. 
  By the end of last year, the province had approved the 
setting up of more than 800 Taiwan-funded enterprises, doubling 
the figure of the previous year. The enterprises had taken in 
521 million U.S. dollars from Taiwanese businessmen. 
  Government officials attribute the boom to the province's 
rich natural and labor resources and a fairly strong industrial 
and technological power. 
  The investors are going to light industry, electronics, high 
technology and real estate development instead of the previously 
favored catering trade and processing of agricultural and 
sideline products, the officials said. 
  Big companies and financial groups from Taiwan have also 
begun to set up businesses in the province to pursue large 
development projects.

  [Excerpt] A ceremony promoting Comrade Zhang Zhu, 
political commissar of the Tibet Regional People's Armed Police

solemnly held in the afternoon of 30 December 1993. 
  The title-conferring ceremony was presided over by Zhou 
Qishun, vice chairman of the autonomous regional committee of

public security department. 
  Guo Jinlong, Yang Chuantang, and Gyamco, leaders of the 
autonomous region; leaders of the TRPAPC; and principal leaders 
of the Tibet-based units at and above the regimental level 
participated in the ceremony.

party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional people's 
government, read out a promotion order signed by State Council 
Premier Li Peng and Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang 
Zemin, and delivered a speech on behalf of the autonomous 
regional party committee and the autonomous regional people's 
government. 
  Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said that Comrade Zhang Zhu's 
promotion to the police title of major general was an honor not 
only to himself but also to the TRPAPC. On behalf of the 
autonomous regional party committee and the autonomous regional 
people's government, he offered warm congratulations to Comrade 
Zhang Zhu. 
  In his speech Chairman Gyaincain Norbu spoke highly of 
Political Commissar Zhang Zhu as well as all the officers and 
men of the TRPAPC. He said: As a political commissar of the 
TRPAPC and as a leader of units construction, Comrade Zhang Zhu 
resolutely implemented the party's line, principles, and 
policies; carried out various instructions and orders issued by 
the TRPAPC and the regional party committee; always placed the 
units under the absolute leadership of the party; united and led 
members of the party committee to vigorously tackle various 
construction jobs of the units; and did an outstanding job 
fulfilling the various tasks entrusted by the party and people. 
In particular, in the struggle to quell the riots in Lhasa and 
to stabilize Tibet's situation, Comrade Zhang Zhu led all the 
officers and men in taking a clear-cut stand, standing in the 
forefront of the fight against splittism, and waging a resolute 
struggle against splittist forces, thereby making remarkable 
contributions to safeguarding the unification of the motherland 
and to stabilizing Tibet's situation. The autonomous regional 
party committee, the autonomous regional people's government, 
and the people of all nationalities in Tibet are satisfied with 
the work done by the TRPAPC and Comrade Zhang Zhu. He urged 
Comrade Zhang Zhu to live up to the ardent expectations of the 
party and people, to turn honor into a driving force, to better 
unite and lead all the officers and men of the TRPAPC to conduct 
intensive study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to seek unity of thinking 
among officers and men, and to persist in using Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period to guide 
the construction of the units so as to make new contributions to 
protecting Tibet's economic construction, reform, and opening 
up. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kunming, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Yunnan Province has kept on increasing input into agriculture 
and achieved bumper harvests for five years running. 
  Since 1989 the total amount of the funds poured into 
agriculture in the province has been the highest in the country. 
  In 1992 the amount allocated to agriculture by the province 
was 2.64 billion yuan, accounting for 21.7 percent of the annual 
total expenditure of the province. The figure was 13 percentage 
points higher than average level of the funds allocated for 
industry. 
  Over the past five years Yunnan has invested 2.18 billion 
yuan in water conservancy projects, and 44 large- and 
medium-sized projects were carried out smoothly. 
  Now the irrigable area of the farmland in Yunnan has 
increased to 1.1 million ha [hectares], and high-yielding 
farmland occupies about 690,000 ha. 
  In 1993 Yunnan's grain output hit a record 10.85 billion kg, 
an increase of 148 million kg over the previous year.

  [Text] Hohhot, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Beijing is to get 
more electricity from the neighboring Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region in the next few years. 
  By 1995 the capacity of power supply from Inner Mongolia is 
to rise to 1.50 million kw, and by 2000 that figure will climb 
to five million kw, according to the power department of the 
region. 
  Beijing gets one seventh of its electric power from Inner 
Mongolia, which is rich in coal resources. Since 1990 a total 
of four billion kwh of electricity have been transmitted to 
Beijing from the region. 
  In the past, most of the herdsmen in the region had to rely 
on cow dung for heat and light, and as late as the 1950s there 
were only seven small power plants with a total capacity of 
1,750 kw in the autonomous region. But by 1987 the total 
electricity production capacity in the autonomous region had 
surpassed 800,000 kw. 
  Officials said that since 1988 a group of large 
thermoelectric power plants have been built. So far, the 
generating capacity has topped 2.40 million kw -- more than 
enough to meet the local demand. 
  At present, several large power plants are still under 
construction. Upon their completion in 1995 they will increase 
the total capacity to eight million kw.

  [Text] Beijing, January 15 (XINHUA) -- All of the 862 
proposals put forward by deputies to the Municipal People's 
Congress here have been given due consideration. 
  According to Zhu Zupu, deputy secretary-general of the 
municipal government, deputies to the city's people's congress 
put forward an average of more than two proposals a day last 
year. All the proposals, tackling issues ranging from official 
corruption, city planning to pornography, were adopted. 
  Ten proposals which are beyond the powers of the 
municipality 
have been submitted to the State Council, he revealed. 
  Zhu, speaking following the closing of the Eighth Session of 
the Standing Committee of the 10th Municipal People's Congress 
Friday [14 January], cited the example of the ban on 
firecrackers by the city government at the call of more than 40 
people's deputies. 
  The city also waged an anti-porn campaign in the publication 
industry after adopting a proposal from Wang Li and 13 other 
deputies, Zhu said. 
  The deputies also voiced their demands for a bigger 
education 
budget and better living conditions for teachers. The city 
boosted educational expenditure by over one-fifth over the 
previous year in 1993. The latest official figures show that 
teachers received the third-largest increase in income last 
year, following rises for policemen and enterprise workers. 
  It was a deputy's proposal that spurred the city government 
to set up Beijing's first international futures trading company. 
Another proposal resulted in the establishment of two large 
wholesale book markets. 
  The Municipal People's Congress is a medium-level 
legislature 
of the country's people's congress system. The present congress 
was elected in 1993 and will remain in office for five years. 
  Feedback from the deputies shows that most of them are 
satisfied with the way their proposals have been handled.

  [Text] Beijing Capital International Airport has launched 
an all-out superior service campaign for Spring Festival. 
  Some 14,000 domestic and overseas travellers daily have 
transited the airport since the holiday season began January 20, 
a jump of 30 percent over regular usage. 
  The high-profile campaign spotlights resolute measures to 
guarantee ground security and flying safety-the biggest concern 
of the travelling public. 
  Approximately 300 security inspectors, using new X-ray 
machines and handheld metal detectors, are combing each 
passenger for any dangerous article. 
  The airport's 4,000 employees have pledged to improve 
service 
during the 40-day holiday period. 
  Their actions have included soliciting passenger opinions 
and 
advice through a poll conducted a few days ago. 
  The poll covered public facilities, environmental 
sanitation, 
shopping service, catering service and the security check. 
  Of the 300 travellers polled, 59.4 per cent said "very 
satisfactory," 32.1 per cent "satisfactory," and 8.5 per cent 
"discontented," particularly with catering and shopping service. 
  Travellers also suggested improving comprehensive service 
facilities in the waiting building, like more telephones and 
telegraph, more news stalls and detailed flight information.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (CNS)--People from various 
provinces and cities staying temporarily in Beijing have 
numbered some 1.5 million in the past three years and the number 
will become even greater in the future, obliging the Beijing 
authorities to adopt strengthened administrative measures to 
deal with the migrant population in the municipality. 
  An official from the department of household registration of 
the Beijing Public Security Bureau revealed that the migrant 
population posed many problems, especially those of public order 
which has seen half of the criminals arrested in the 
municipality being non- permanent residents even though this 
group of the population made a contribution to the prosperity of 
the municipality. 
  A seminar held by local bureaus of public security in 
Beijing 
was aimed at collecting opinions from the public in a bid to 
work out measures to maintain public order. Many of those who 
expressed an opinion at the seminar said that the increase in 
use of police radio for reporting of crimes should be employed. 
  Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shen Zui, in a speech 
praised the introduction of the police patrol system, saying he 
was convinced that the police should patrol with police dogs in 
order to impose further deterrence on criminals. He also called 
for the installation of the more telephones for the reporting of 
crime. 
  An expert on teenage education pointed out that great 
attention should be paid to the fact that the age of criminals 
was becoming younger and that education in the law for teenagers 
had to be boosted. A public security official said that the 
administration of public order had to be based on the strict 
cracking down on crime. He added that reform of public security 
work should be carried out with the aim of keeping in line with 
the socialist market economy system.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- The capital city's 
court has executed six criminals convicted of murder, rape and 
assault of women last year. 
  The clampdown on crimes against women is part of the city's 
efforts to implement the law on the protection of women's rights 
and interests. 
  Li Qiaoyun, vice-president of the city's committee on the 
protection of women's rights and interests, said that her 
committee handled 1,350 cases of violation of women's rights in 
the past 14 months. Over 180 of them were "major" and "knotty" 
cases, she said. 
  The city's people's court and district courts hold public 
trials to announce punishment for criminals for cruelty against 
women. Li said that the public trials were effective in 
"deterring other criminals." 
  She said that the courts give priority to hearing cases 
involving women's rights. Divorce cases involve many "thorny 
issues", she said. The issues include support for children, 
division of property and housing for the divorcees. The city's 
supreme court has expressly imposed favorable provisions for 
women in handling such cases. 
  The municipal people's congress, the city's legislature, is 
now striving to pass a detailed bill on implementing the state 
women's law within this year. 
  Since the law on women's protection came into force in 
October 1992, a grassroots network of women's protection 
committees has been set up throughout neighborhoods and suburban 
areas. A medical scheme for women has been initiated in the 
downtown district of Chaoyang, providing special medical service 
for the 210,000 female employees in the district. 
  In order to give more say to women in the government, the 
present city government has accepted a higher percentage of 
women officials than previous ones. Women hold seven of 47 
leading posts in municipal departments. Gender representation 
was also considered in appointments of lower level officials.

<F P=106> ["Year-end special report" by XINHUA reporters Xia Junsheng </F>
(1115 0193 3932) and Li Feng (2621 3536): "Barriers Between the 
Status of Cadres and Workers Have Been Broken Down; 120,000 
Workers in Beijing Have Assumed Leadership and Management 
Positions in Enterprises"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- The situation in 
which a cadre will always be a cadre while a worker will always 
remain a worker has now become a thing of the past at Beijing's 
state-owned enterprises. By deepening reform of the enterprise 
personnel system and breaking down the barriers in regard to the 
status of cadres and workers, some 120,000 exemplary workers in 
Beijing have assumed leadership and management positions in 
enterprises. 
  For years, Chinese enterprises practiced a "life tenure" 
system in regard to the status of cadres and workers. Once you 
became a cadre, it meant you were sitting on an "iron armchair" 
-- your rank was guaranteed for life regardless of your ability 
and performance. Restricted by his status, a worker, no matter 
of how talented he is, will find it almost impossible to assume 
leadership or management responsibility in an enterprises. Such 
a personnel system is not conducive to optimizing managerial 
talent and promoting talent. 
  In 1984, Beijing started introducing competition mechanisms 
in a bid to reform the enterprise personnel system. On one 
hand, the city introduced an appointments system for the 
existing cadres. Those who were not appointed were reassigned as 
workers and paid as such. Their status as a cadre was retained 
only in their personal files. At the same time, outstanding 
workers were appointed administrators and managers and started 
to draw the benefits due cadres. A new mechanism of mobility 
whereby both cadres and workers can be assigned as a worker or 
manager and receive the benefits due their posts began to take 
shape. Figures of the Beijing City Personnel Bureau show that 
workers hired as cadres account for nearly one-third of the 
cadres in the city's state-owned enterprises. In some 
enterprises, such cadres account for nearly half of the ranks of 
cadres. 
  Promoting cadres from among workers has put an end to the 
situation in which demobilized Army cadres and graduates of 
colleges and secondary vocational schools made up the primary 
source of cadres, thereby expanding the source of potential 
cadres available for the entire work force of enterprises and 
creating opportunities for outstanding workers to show their 
talents. In hiring cadres, enterprises in Beijing earnestly 
solicit the views of workers and set strict standards. Most of 
the workers selected are under 35 and have finished senior high 
school. They have rich work experience, are content with their 
work, and can identify with the workers. Most of them have 
become backbone management personnel. [passage omitted] 
  Cadres who are promoted from among cadres do not have an 
"iron armchair" on which to sit. Enterprises appraise the 
performance of every appointed cadre. Competent ones will be 
reappointed and the incompetent ones will be demoted or 
reassigned as a worker. This has injected competition, energy, 
and mobility into the ranks of cadres. Every year, about 20,000 
outstanding workers in the city's state-owned enterprises are 
promoted to the ranks of management. At the same time, a number 
of incompetent cadres are reassigned as workers. This has not 
only enhanced the sense of competition and self-restraint among 
appointed cadres but has also aroused the initiative of the 
demoted cadres. [passage omitted] 
  Party committees at all levels in Beijing have stepped up 
efforts to elevate workers to cadre level by, among other 
things, having them take courses at party schools or spare-time 
universities to improve their knowledge of policies and to 
sharpen their vocational skills. To institutionalize and 
standardize this practice of enterprises appointing cadres from 
among the workers, the city personnel bureau has formulated a 
series of regulations governing the promotion, evaluation, 
approval, management, and material benefits of 
workers-turned-cadres.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Four-year-old Xu 
Lihua and seven-year-old Zhai Xiaolong would have lived in 
miserable disability for their whole lives were it not for a 
large-scale initiative for handicapped orphans launched by 
Beijing hospitals. 
  Now, they have returned to the Beijing Children's Welfare 
Institute, where they have lived since they were deserted by 
their parents, completely recovered from congenital glaucoma and 
ear deformity. 
  They are starting a bright new life. 
  The two children are among handicapped orphans from the 
institute who were selected to receive free medical treatment, a 
charity move by the city's public health bureau. 
  The Beijing Children's Welfare Institute is the country's 
largest, housing more than 600 homeless children, 90 percent of 
whom are handicapped. 
  Many children in the institute are confined to bed all year 
round, due to illnesses ranging from heart disease to congenital 
handicaps. Half of them have been in urgent need for medical 
treatment. 
  Although staff try their best to take care of these 
children, 
it is impossible for the institute to raise the huge amount of 
money needed. 
  Last August, two deputies to the Beijing People's Congress 
revealed the problem in a report to the city's public health 
bureau. 
  Zhu Zonghan, head of the bureau, went to the institute 
himself for an inspection. He then made the decision to arrange 
operations for the children. 
  Two months later, the bureau organized experts from five 
hospitals to examine 40 children. Thirty-two of them were 
selected for operations. 
  On December 3, the municipal public health bureau called on 
all hospitals in Beijing to offer free treatment to save the 
handicapped orphans. 
  The proposal won wide support. Twenty-six hospitals 
committed themselves to perform operations, while many other 
hospitals provided assistance in technology, equipment and funds. 
  A hospital volunteered to accept five hare-lipped children, 
and promised to look for foster parents for them. 
  The Beijing children's hospital promised to take all the 
child patients the other hospitals could not. 
  On January 12, all the 32 children suffering from severe 
problems, such as large-scale scalds, hydrocrania, heart 
deformities or harelip, were sent to the 26 hospitals for the 
best of treatment. 
  Various enterprises gave money to help in saving the 
children. A Beijing-Taiwan joint venture handed over 20,000 
yuan (2,100 U.S. dollars). 
  Many organisations, such as the city's association for the 
handicapped, the department of civil administration and the 
women's federation have also shown their concern in a practical 
manner. 
  Zhu Li, wife of Premier Li Peng, and Lin Jiamei, wife of 
China's former President Li Xiannian, have visited the children 
and brought them toys.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Beijing achieved 
remarkable progress in afforestation in the past year. 
  According to an official from the Beijing Municipal 
Afforestation Committee, 541 hectares of green belts were added 
in the urban area last year while 640,000 hectares were greened 
in the suburbs. 
  Surveys show that tree coverage in Beijing City has reached 
33.58 percent. 
  The official said that Beijing now has over 90 parks. In the 
satellite towns there are 2,400 hectares of green areas and 
shelterbelts. 
  He said that the afforestation reduced times of dusty wind 
by 
30 percent and silt content by 60 percent in the water of Miyun 
reservoir, one of the major sources of drinking water in Beijing. 
  By the end of this century, Beijing will plant 2,600 
hectares

  [Text] The provincial agricultural work conference ended a 
few days ago. 
  In the past five years, the province's grain production 
basically increased at a slow speed. After 1988 when the 
province produced over 20 billion kg of grain, the province's 
grain output has remained at around 22.5 billion kg for the past 
two years. According to the development plan of the provincial 
government, the grain output of the province should reach 27.5 
billion kg by 2000. This task is extremely arduous. The cotton 
production situation is even more serious. To this end, the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government defined 
that in 1994, the province should strive to turn out 23.5 
billion kg while ensuring the production of 23 billion kg of 
grain, and strive to turn out 500 million kg while ensuring the 
production of 400 million kg of cotton. The ideas for guiding 
the province's agricultural work are to realize the target of 
becoming fairly well-off, to take the overall situation into 
consideration, to focus on steadily increasing grain and cotton 
production and increasing the income of the peasants, to deepen 
reform, to expand the scale of opening up, to make structural 
readjustment, to perfect systems, to make a breakthrough in 
science and technology, to vigorously develop high-yield, 
good-quality, and highly efficient agriculture, and to 
accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization. Under 
the guidance of these ideas, this year, we should win a tough 
battle in grain and cotton production. We should adopt forceful 
measures to bring about an upswing in cotton production. From 
this year, the provincial government begins carrying out 
mandatory planned management of cotton production and 
distribution and also to sign letters of responsibility with 
various prefectural and city governments so as to ensure the 
fulfillment of the cotton production task. The general 
requirements for this year's grain production are to stabilize 
the grain and cotton sown areas, to optimize the grain and 
cotton structure, to improve the quality, and [words 
indistinct]. The province's grain sown areas should surpass 100 
million mu and must not fluctuate by a big margin. We should 
adopt different techniques to sow wheat on different wheat 
fields and try every possible means to ensure the scientific 
management of wheat field. In regard to corn production, we 
should vigorously carry out the key measures to change the 
growing forms and change the quality and to increase the input 
and the density in an effort to set a new record in corn 
production.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Mu Yajun (4476 0068 6511) and Guo Dejin (6753 </F>
1795 6855): "Correctly Recognize the Current Situation and 
Properly Handle the Relations in Various Sectors"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 3 January, regional party and 
government leaders, including Wang Qun, Wang Zhao, Wuyunqimuge, 
and Zhao Zhihong, went deeply to Inner Mongolia University to 
hold a forum of leaders as well as teaching and administrative 
staff of the university on how to recognize the current 
situation and on the work of institutions of higher learning 
under the new situation. Xu Bonian, vice chairman of the 
regional committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, attended the forum. Wang Qun gave 
important views. 
  Wang Qun said: The theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete 
system and a strong ideological weapon for guiding the Chinese 
people to realize the great ideal of invigorating China. At 
present the most important task is to use this theory to further 
arm the minds of the whole party, in particular, the leading 
cadres at all levels. on the basis of studying well the 
original work in line with the reality of the current reform and 
development, we should realistically unify our ideology with the 
spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, the 14th party congress, and the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, great achievements have been made in 
the whole country, in the regional economic construction, 
reform, opening up and in all fields of work. These 
achievements can be seen by all. We should extensively 
popularize these achievements in an effort to strengthen the 
confidence of the masses of people of various nationalities, 
including the broad masses of teachers and students of colleges 
and universities, in advancing triumphantly along the socialist 
road with Chinese characteristics. We should educate the broad 
masses of cadres to correctly recognize the current situation, 
seize the opportunity, and spare no efforts to comprehensively 
advance reform and opening up. It is necessary to properly 
handle the relations of reform, development and stability, and 
the relationship between the part and the whole, and between 
immediate interests and long-term ones in an effort to stimulate 
the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and 
the people and to give better play to reform and development. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: While fully affirming the 
achievements, and the current situation in the main aspect, we 
should analyze the existing difficulties and problems on our 
road of advance in a fact- seeking manner. Reform and 
construction is the cause of 100 million people. As long as we 
unswervingly rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, and cadres at all levels, mobilize all positive 
factors, and unite with all the forces that can be united, we 
can overcome all difficulties. We should continue to promote 
the spirit of arduous struggle and dedication, work with one 
heart and one mind, help one another, and work in a 
down-to-earth manner. Only thus, can we be able to overcome all 
difficulties, create new achievements, and win new victories. 
  In referring to the issue of anticorruption, Wang Qun said: 
We should historically and dialectically analyze unhealthy 
trends and corrupt phenomena, fully understand the long-term 
nature, arduousness and complexity of anticorruption struggle, 
and realistically regard this struggle as one of the strategic 
tasks and uphold it with unremitting efforts. At present, our 
region has achieved certain achievements in anticorruption 
struggle, and the self-inspection and correction of leading 
cadres, the investigation and handling of major and appalling 
cases, and the checking of unhealthy trends in various trades 
are being deeply carried out. He said: In anticorruption work, 
we must first be resolute and second be fact-seeking, and manage 
things in line with law. We should combine reform and 
anticorruption with stability and development in an effort to 
guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. 
  In his speech, Wang Qun fully affirmed the work of Inner 
Mongolia University and its special educational program on the 
current situation which will be carried out soon.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 21 January the autonomous region 
held a regional television conference on the struggle against 
corruption to summarize the recent situation in making progress 
in the struggle against corruption and to further mobilize the 
people to continuously step up the implementation of the three 
tasks set in the struggle before the Spring Festival. 
  During the conference Geriletu, member of the autonomous 
regional party standing committee and secretary of the 
autonomous regional discipline inspection commission, delivered 
a speech in which he said: Since September 1993, the regional 
level units as well as various leagues and cities have generally 
conducted various work set in the struggle against corruption 
under the conditions of short time limit, of heavy tasks, and of 
that the struggle involves in a large range of things. Most 
localities and departments have earnestly and actively launched 
the struggle against corruption and scored certain achievements 
in the three tasks of the struggle. Negative and corrupt 
phenomena have somewhat disappeared and the people's confidence 
in the struggle has been somewhat enhanced. The development of 
the work as a whole has been healthy. During the struggle 
against corruption, party committees and governments at all 
levels have paid attention to it and established the 
responsibility system at all levels for the struggle. They have 
effectively conducted supervision and inspection over the 
struggle work. Various localities and departments have steadily 
upgraded their ideology and understanding by urging their 
personnel to steadily enhance their study while waging the 
struggle. Many localities have vigorously grasped the 
implementation of the work by persistently proceeding from 
reality and emphatically dealt with their own prominent problems. 
  Geriletu pointed out: In reviewing the work done over the 
past four months, we must note while acknowledging the 
achievements that there still is a large gap between the effects 
scored in the struggle as well as the demands set forth by the 
CPC Central Committee and the autonomous regional party 
committee and the people's expectation. Things that have been 
done in the struggle work still cannot satisfy the people's 
feeling. We should fully discern the importance, emergency, and 
arduousness of the struggle; overcome the thinking of adopting a 
wait and see attitude, implicating others, and fearing 
difficulties; and further enhance the leadership over the 
struggle and vigorously grasp the implementation of the 
struggle's tasks. 
  In citing the struggle around the Spring Festival, Geriletu 
said: Efforts should be made to further enhance the study, to 
continuously upgrade the ideology and understanding of cadres at 
all levels and the vast number of people, to unswervingly and 
successfully grasp the three tasks for the recent period. In 
organizing leading personnel, it is imperative to enhance the 
unified leadership between party committees and governments and 
to uphold and implement the work-division responsibility system 
among leading personnel for the struggle. In encouraging 
leading cadres to perform their official duties honestly and to 
conduct self discipline, we should vigorously handle various 
problems discovered from their self examinations. In 
investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, we 
should accelerate the pace of handling the exposed important 
cases and further rely on the mass to actively report the 
corrupt phenomena through letters or visits. We should achieve 
in having every report offered through letters or visits be 
accepted seriously. In correcting malpractice, the cases of 
making overseas travels with public funds and illegally 
purchasing imported sedans should be totally handled before the 
Spring Festival. Efforts should be made to step up the work of 
checking the illegal business and enterprises run by the party 
and government organs, of correcting the arbitrary collections, 
and of clarifying the two line of revenue and spending. The key 
departments of banking, electric power, railways, and post and 
telecommunication should continuously and vigorously grasp the 
consolidation in their specialized working projects. 
  Geriletu urged various localities and departments to 
earnestly summarize the work done in the struggle for this 
period, put forward work arrangements for next period, and to 
take the struggle for promoting the establishment of socialist 
market economic systems by proceeding from the whole situation. 
Localities should strictly implement the spirit of circulars 
issued the general offices of the CPC Central Committee, the 
State Council, the autonomous regional party committee, and the 
autonomous regional people's government so as to have a happy 
Spring Festival with an honest and peaceful atmosphere. 
  Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the autonomous regional 
people's 
government, presided over the television conference and also 
delivered a speech.

  [Text] Hohhot, January 26 (XINHUA) -- North China's Inner 
Mongolia is to invest at least 32.02 billion yuan in its 
petrochemical sector this year. 
  The aims is to make it a pillar of the regional economy by 
the turn of the century. 
  The money will be used to start more petrochemical 
businesses 
and launch six major petrochemical production centers in the 
region during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95) and the 
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000). 
  According to Li Fulin, director of the Petrochemical 
Industrial Bureau of Inner Mongolia, during the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan period, the petrochemical industry of the region is 
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 17.5 percent. 
  By the year 2000, total output value of the petrochemical 
industry is expected to hit 8.844 billion yuan. 
  The petrochemical industry has been developing rapidly over 
the past years in the autonomous region, known for its vast 
grassland and well developed animal husbandry. 
  In 1993, the petrochemical industry in the autonomous region 
generated 2.335 billion yuan in output value. 
  As one of China's leading pastoral areas, Inner Mongolia 
also 
abounds in petrochemical resources, with reserves of major raw 
chemical industrial materials of coal, petroleum, natural gas, 
trona, salt and mirabilite. 
  The autonomous region has 13 large natural gas fields and 
its 
verified oil reserves are estimated at 21 billion bbl [barrels] 
and natural gas, 150 billion cu m [cubic meters]. 
  The rich petrochemical industrial resources and the 
implementation of various reform measures have given rise to the 
quick development of petrochemical industry in this north China 
autonomous region, said local officials. 
  At present, Inner Mongolia, which used to rely heavily just 
on animal husbandry, has now 132 enterprises engaged in 
petrochemical industrial production, turning out 28 categories 
of products, such as basic chemical raw materials, organic 
chemicals, synthetic materials, and chemicals for agricultural 
use.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in 
Chinese at 2131 GMT on 14 January carries a 2,853-character 
"newsletter" by XINHUA reporters Hui Jinyi (1920 6855 5030) and 
Chen Shuiquan (7115 3055 3123): "Dazhai on the Way To the 
Market." The newsletter details efforts by the people of Dazhai 
Village -- a production brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi 
Province touted as a pacesetter in agriculture during the 
prereform years -- to develop a market economy under the village 
party branch secretary Guo Fenglian. 
  The newsletter begins with the reporters' observations 
during 
their trip to the village on an unspecified date in the winter. 
Noting that "the vast expanse of snow did not quiet the seething 
Dazhai," the newsletter says: "In Dazhai today, activity is 
seething everywhere. The people of Dazhai are taking gigantic 
steps forward in developing a commodity economy by integrating 
the new concepts of reform and opening up with the pioneering 
spirit of self-reliance and hard work." The newsletter 
continues to describe Guo Fenglian's observations regarding the 
gap between Dazhai and other parts of the country when she 
returned to the village in November 1991 after an 11-year 
absence. Recalling how Vice Premier Tian Jiyun provided the 
answer to closing the gap during his inspection tour of Dazhai 
on an unspecified date, the newsletter states: "He urged the 
people of Dazhai to emancipate their minds, renew their 
concepts, broaden avenues, and work in concert to achieve a 
comfortable living standard." It goes on to describe how the 
villagers introduced new crop strains to diversify their grain- 
based agriculture, and how they set up joint ventures with 
factories in other parts of the province, trained skilled 
personnel, brought in foreign capital, and developed tourism. 
The newsletter concludes by commending the spirit of hard work 
displayed by the people of Dazhai, saying: "In learning to 
develop a market economy, the people of Dazhai have not 
neglected the Dazhai spirit of hard work."

overseas-funded enterprises, contracted overseas investment, and 
is second in the nine other indices including the export volume. 
  Up to the end of 1993, the zone has approved 1,709 
overseas-funded enterprises, with a registered capital of 1.72 
billion U.S. dollars, since it was launched in 1984 upon the 
approval of the State Council. 
  The zone, 137 km to southeast of Beijing, also attracted 
some 
2,930 enterprises funded by other Chinese regions, with the 
registered capital reaching 7.39 billion yuan. 
  At a new conference Saturday [22 January], officials from 
the 
development zone said that they would regard its tenth

  [Text] Tianjin, January 22 (XINHUA) -- The rural township 
industry in Tianjin picked up in 1993, with a total production 
output value of 54 billion yuan, a sizzling 35 percent rise from 
the previous year. 
  The rural sector in the city earned nearly four billion 
yuan, 
up 38 percent over 1992. The output value of the township 
enterprises was about 85 percent of the total for all rural 
households. 
  The development of Tianjin's rural sector has derived from 
the advantages of its coastal area around the Beijing and 
Tianjin urban districts. 
  Both rural productivity and industrial earnings have taken 
the lead in the whole township industrial sector of the country. 
  There are now 42 township companies whose annual output goes 
beyond 100 million yuan; and the total annual output value in 14 
different industrial sections each surpasses one billion yuan, 
including the ferrous metals, machinery, chemicals and textile 
industries. 
  The city has also set up 43 township business groups over 
the 
past few years. 
  Most of these rural enterprises have now entered the market 
by adopting a joint stock system. There are more than 630 such 
companies that carried out the stock system by the end of last 
year, according to a recent survey conducted by a governmental 
department. 
  Also, the flow of foreign investment into the rural areas 
has 
breathed life into the township enterprises. 
  In 1993, the municipal government approved the building of 
885 new joint ventures, with over 400 million U.S. dollars 
flowing in. 
  About 1,280 township companies earned 5.1 billion yuan 
through exports alone. 
  With the rise of the service industry, the city also earned 
800 million yuan last year, a 90 percent rise from the previous 
year, and broke ground in developing its commerce, food, 
transportation, real estate, and tourism. 
  It also channeled a large sum of money toward boosting the 
development of the new and high-tech industry, and more than 
5,000 farmers took part in various training classes last year.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 25 (XINHUA) -- A legion of 
well-trained personnel is one explanation for the increasing 
inflow of overseas investment into this largest port city of 
north China. 
  Many big-name companies and financial groups worldwide have 
come to do business in Tianjin because of the ample supply of 
talented people here. 
  Statistics show that in 1993 the city approved the setting 
up 
of a record 3,500 overseas-funded ventures, with a large 
proportion of them engaging in technology- or capital-intensive 
projects. 
  City officials said a healthy cycle of supply and demand, 
and 
transfer and management of talented people has formed in the 
city, as there is a steadily increasing supply of and demand for 
such persons. 
  At a talent fare on January 18 this year more than 30 
overseas-funded enterprises were among hundreds of firms 
recruiting specialized technical and managerial personnel as 
well as skilled workers. 
  At one counter a solely Japanese-funded firm specializing in 
electronics in the city's high-tech development zone was visited 
by more than 100 high-grade personnel though the company wanted 
to hire only 20 management professionals. 
  Qin Huilin, personnel manager of the firm, said, "we have 
plenty of room to maneuver and pick out the best." 
  She also said that in just one month before the firm went 
into business in August 1992, the company had recruited over 200 
people skilled in management, finance and technical maintenance 
to fill all the vacancies. 
  After a short period of training all of them were well 
adapted to their respective work, Qin said, adding that the 
firm's product quality has reached the Japanese standard. 
  "A major reason that we have progressed so far and so fast 
is 
that we have a qualified staff," she said, noting that all the 
500 employees of her company were recruited from talent centers. 
  Zhou Jiazhu, chief executive of the Tianjin Municipal Talent 
Exchange Center, said more than 1,000 overseas-funded ventures 
hired over 20,000 well-trained professionals from his center 
last year but the overall situation of the city's labor market 
is that supply far surpasses demand. 
  He said world-renowned companies like Coca-Cola, Motorola 
and 
Yamaha can be choosy, as they are besieged by hundreds of 
applicants every day. 
  According to Zhou, Tianjin has a large bank of talent, with 
personnel specializing in all fields. No company in Tianjin 
will have difficulty employing any kind of high-level 
professional, he assured. 
  In one case, Zhou said, a joint venture unsure whether it 
could find several first-class technicians at a talent fare 
received more than 70 well-qualified applicants in only three 
hours. 
  An official with the municipal personnel bureau said the 
city 
has over 600,000 specialized professionals and technicians, and 
200,000 of them are of superior grade. He added that, overall, 
more than 80 percent of the city's nine million-strong 
population are well-educated. 
  He further pointed out that the city's talent reserve will 
keep growing, as Tianjin has 26 universities, around 1,000 
technical schools and more than 140 natural science research 
institutes. 
  As a result, the official said, the municipal economy is 
growing robustly and overseas-funded ventures are springing up 
ever faster. 
  The city's flourishing talent market is also attracting 
flocks of talented people in north China to Tianjin, he said, 
citing Beijing as one of the major sources. 
  The official said the on-going reform in the country's 
personnel and employment systems will push more people onto the 
market for job opportunities and transfers, which is sure to 
benefit overseas-funded ventures. 
  Meanwhile he said the Tianjin Municipal Government is to 
launch a series of projects, such as "The Rising Sun Project" 
and "The Cross-Century Talent Project", to tackle problems such 
as the aging of professional talents and knowledge structure as 
well as to train more people for its modernization drive in the 
long run.

  [Text] At today's provincial conference on public security, 
procuratorial and judicial work, Xie Yong, secretary of the 
provincial commission on politics and law and vice chairman of 
the provincial people's congress standing committee, called on 
public security, procuratorial and judicial organs at all levels 
to exert utmost efforts to maintain political stability, further 
strengthen comprehensive management of public security, and 
actively provide effective legal services and legal guarantee 
for economic construction. 
  In 1993, the public security, procuratorial and judicial 
organs across the province and the broad masses of public 
security, procuratorial and judicial cadres and policemen acted 
in close connection with the central task of economic 
construction under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee and governments at all levels, further strengthened 
and improved public security work, dealt strict blows to serious 
criminal activities, concentrated efforts on investigating and 
handling major and appalling criminal cases, strengthened 
comprehensive management of public security, actively provided 
legal service for reform, opening up and economic construction, 
effectively safeguarded political and social stability in the 
whole province, and made important contributions to economic and 
social development. The provincial party committee has decided 
that the general guiding ideology of public security, 
procuratorial and judicial work in 1994 is to conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and of the national public security, 
procuratorial and judicial work conference, act in close 
connection with the central task of economic construction, 
pinpoint the priorities, comprehensively promote this work, give 
full play to the functional role of public security, 
procuratorial and judicial organs, safeguard political and 
social stability, and strive to create a good social environment 
for building the socialist market economic system. 
  Xie Yong pointed out: In the past year, all localities 
across the province acted in line with the plans of the 
provincial party committee, consistently considered safeguarding 
political stability as the task of prime importance, did lots of 
painstaking and meticulous work, and succeeded in maintaining 
political stability in the whole province. This year we should 
realistically safeguard political stability as the task of prime 
importance, acted in close connection with the key aspect of 
correctly handling the internal contradictions of the people, 
strive to deeply and meticulously carry out this work, and try 
by all possible means to maintain political stability in the 
whole province. Party committees and governments as well as 
public security, procuratorial and judicial departments at all 
levels should properly handle the relations of stability, 
reform, and development, and maintain political stability during 
the whole course of reform. When we issue one reform measure, 
we should give consideration to the possible influence that may 
cause to political stability, purposefully adopt preventive 
measures, and strive to reduce social turbulence. It is 
necessary to realistically strengthen ideological and political 
work, strive to dissolve social contradictions, be good at 
hearing the voice of the masses and using the democratic, 
persuasive, and educational methods to improve the ideological 
feelings of the people. All localities should act in line with 
the demand of the provincial party committee, pay great 
attention to the living of workers of enterprises with 
difficulties, actively raise funds to pay the wages of workers 
left in arrears, and help them solve practical difficulties. 
Party and government leaders and relevant departments at all 
levels should pay full attention to the hot issues which the 
masses show strong reactions, adopt effective measures and solve 
them one by one in an effort to calm the feelings of the masses 
and guarantee social stability. 
  Xie Yong pointed out: To further successfully carry out the 
public security comprehensive management work under the new 
situation, this year all localities should conscientiously 
implement the central stipulations on implementing the 
leadership responsibility system in comprehensive management of 
public security, further implement the principle that those who 
takes charge of the work should assume full responsibility and 
the system of negating everything if one fails to do a good job 
in public security work, help the party and government leaders 
at all levels grasp the comprehensive improvement of public 
security. 
  Xie Yong emphatically pointed out: This year we should 
regard cracking major cases, dealing blows to criminal cliques, 
and capturing escaped criminals as the priorities, strengthen 
routine work, organize special struggle in a timely manner, 
resolutely check the upward trend of major cases, such as 
murder, robbery, rape, major theft, and serious crimes on 
violence. To do a good job in dealing strict blows to 
criminals, we must conscientiously solve the problem of failing 
to strictly enforce law and further raise the quality of dealing 
blows and social effect. It is necessary to conscientiously 
consolidate cultural places, strengthen control over the 
criminal trend and fugitive criminals in society, actively 
conduct activity on running villages in line with law, and 
implement democratic management.

<F P=106> [By reporter Di Jingyao (5049 2529 5069) and correspondent </F>
Mou Jingjun (3664 2529 0689)] 
  [Text] Harbin, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Heilongjiang Province 
has firmly implemented the State Council's "Circular on Banning 
Rhinoceros Horn Trade" and "Circular on Speedily Investigating 
and Dealing With Illicit Activities of Smuggling and 
Profiteering in Rhinoceros Horns, Tiger Bones, and Other 
Endangered Species." Recently, it openly destroyed by burning on 
the bank of the Songhua River some 50 kg of tiger bones and 
rhinoceros horns confiscated since last year. This action has 
been well received in various quarters. 
  This is the first time China has resorted to burning 
confiscated rhinoceros horns and tiger bones which were to be 
resold at a profit. According to people concerned, 
Heilongjiang's action demonstrates China's seriousness in 
implementing the "Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species." 
  Tigers and rhinoceroses are valuable and endangered wildlife 
that have been categorized as the state's first class key 
protected animals. Although China does not have a rhinoceroses, 
it has attached great importance to the animal. Since 1981, it 
has never allowed rhinoceroses to be imported into the country, 
and has imposed a series of protective measures on tigers within 
Chinese territory. 
  Heilongjiang, which has relatively rich resources in wild 
animals, has all along paid due attention to protection of wild 
animals. During the statutory inspection organized by the 
Environmental Protection Committees under the National People's 
Congress and the State Council last year, Heilongjiang mobilized 
more than 3,800 people to carry out inspections in nature 
reserves, drug stores, pharmaceutical factories, ports, as well 
as guesthouses, markets, and trade fairs; and it adopted various 
measures to crack down on smuggling and profiteering in 
rhinoceros horns, tiger bones, and other rare wildlife; and the 
measures have had a positive effect on protecting wild animals.

  [Text] The leading comrades of the provincial and Shenyang 
city organs, including Gu Jinchi, Yue Qifeng, Zhang Guoguang, Xu 
Wencai, and Zhang Rongmao, inspected market supplies for the 
Spring Festival in Shenyang on the morning of 24 January and 
called on staff members and workers on the commercial front. 
  At 0900 that day the leading comrades, including Gu Jinchi 
and Yue Qifeng, came to the Dadong shopping center of nonstaple 
foodstuffs. Gu Jinchi said: The state-owned nonstaple 
foodstuffs stores should upgrade as much as possible their 
commodity grade and service level as the Dadong shopping center 
has done so as to saturate the people's demands. Yue Qifeng 
said to (Wang Guofu), manager of the shopping center: Market 
commodities for the Spring Festival this year are abundant and 
commodity prices are stable. Staff members and workers on the 
commercial front have done a great deal of work in this regard. 
In this connection, we would like to extend thanks to them. 
  At 1000 that day, the leading comrades of the provincial and 
Shenyang city organs came to the Commercial Building in the 
center of Shenyang. At the central shopping center, they deeply 
felt that the shopping center has more products turned out by 
outside provinces than those turned out by our province. Yue 
Qifeng said while picking up a sweater: Our province is totally 
able to process such products and the leadership of our 
enterprises should learn from their concept on markets, which 
should produce what the markets need. 
  In the afternoon that day the provincial leaders also 
visited 
and saluted a number of enterprises and households of staff 
members and workers in Tiexi district of Shenyang, which are 
encountering special difficulties.

  [Text] The provincial monetary work conference was held in 
Shenyang on 25 January. Gu Jinchi, Wen Shizhen, and Guo 
Tingbiao attended and addressed the conference. 
  Monetary departments in the province made great efforts to 
carry out rectification and reform last year. Their year-end 
amount of savings deposits totaled 161.6 billion yuan, an 
increase of 26.1 billion yuan over the figure calculated at the 
beginning of the year; and their year-end amount of loans 
totaled 200.7 billion yuan, an increase of 34.7 billion yuan. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
pointed out at the conference: Whether the economy is promoted 
is the major criterion to judge whether good results are 
achieved in monetary reform. Therefore, monetary departments in 
the province should seize the opportunity, boldly emancipate 
their mind, exert active efforts to achieve progress, and make a 
new step in improving their operating mechanism and ease the 
shortage of funds. 
  Wen Shizhen and Guo Tingbiao said in their speeches: 
Shortage of funds remains to be a conspicuous problem in 
economic reform in the new year. Therefore, it is hoped that 
monetary departments will resolve four issues in the period 
prior to and after the Spring Festival. First, they should 
ensure the regular expenses on staff members and workers. 
Second, they should make sure that no IOU is issued to peasants 
during the purchases of farm and sideline products. Third, they 
should ensure the commodity supplies during the festival. 
Fourth, they should supply funds on a priority basis for the 
purchases of raw materials and fuels needed in industrial 
production.

development of the productive forces. Under the situation in 
which difficulty and opportunity have coexisted, the key to 
successfully carrying out economic work lies in our mental 
state, good or bad. If we can maintain a sober mind, enhance the 
sense of urgency and responsibility, turn pressure into 
motivation, strengthen spirit, and advance despite difficulties, 
we will surely be able to seize the new opportunity, greet new 
challenges, and realize new development. 
  Wen Shizhen touched on the following views on pushing our 
province's economy to a new level this year: Conscientiously 
carry out reform of the financial and tax system, actively 
broaden sources of income and reduce expenditure, and do a good 
job in financial and taxation work; rationally determine the 
base figures of revenue and expenditure, and make good 
arrangements for 1994 financial budget; fully understand the 
major significance in reform of the tax system, turn pressure 
into motivation, and actively cultivate new tax sources; 
concentrate efforts on raising the economic efficiency of 
enterprises, and while paying attention to large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, exert efforts to develop 
tertiary industry and township enterprises; and actively guide 
enterprises to expand foreign export trade, and raise the level 
of creating foreign exchange. 
  Wen Shizhen pointed out: This year is crucial to our 
province's reform and development. Particularly, the state has 
successively issued a series of major reform measures within a 
very short period of time. To guarantee the real implementation 
of these reform plans in our province, we should change work 
style, make earnest efforts to do practical things, work 
creatively, advocate the practice of handling official work on 
the spot, promote the habit of conducting investigations and 
studies, care for the living of the people, pay attention to 
solving difficult problems and hot topics in society, and 
guarantee the smooth implementation of the state's all sorts of 
major reform measures. 
  Governor Yu Qifeng and Vice Governors Guo Tingbiao and Gao 
Guozhu attended the conference on 21 January.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning province has recently worked out a scheme for its 
technological development, according to the provincial 
government. 
  The scheme, aimed at developing upgraded new and high-tech 
products, is expected to help enterprises in the province to 
survive fierce competition on the international market. 
  The scheme engages in new and high-tech development 
including 
micro-electronics, computer software science, new materials, 
automation and robotics, biological and oceanic engineering, 
energy saving, environmental protection and transportation. 
  The plan will help the province, one of the most important 
industrial bases in China, to frame the future expansion of its 
leading industries, a government official said. 
  The province, now dominated by energy-consuming industries, 
is expected to shift to technology-intensive production with the 
implementation of the scheme. 
  Four engineering centers concerning the development of new 
materials, industrial robots, special integrated circuits and 
biological technology will be set up in the province around the 
year 2000. 
  More than 3,500 series of products will be developed, of 
which 70 to 80 percent will be put into production. 
  The provincial government will work out special policies to 
promote research and development programs in basic sciences and 
technology and help to put them into industrial production, the 
official said. 
  Major programs will seek overseas cooperation so as to speed 
up the industrial production of new and high technologies, he 
added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 26 (AFP)--Hong Kong asked Beijing 
Wednesday for an "urgently needed" meeting on airport funding, 
despite China's warning that it would not pay the project's 
post-June 1997 debts. 
  A spokesman said in a statement that a meeting with Beijing 
was "urgently needed to enable us reach agreement, so that these 
important projects can proceed without delay." 
  He said the government regretted the statement issued late 
Tuesday by China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, adding 
that it would not help with the construction of the 
20.3-billion-U.S.-dollar airport. 
  The Chinese statement stressed that without a Sino-Hong Kong 
financial agreement on the project, China refused to recognize 
any laws or contracts associated with the airport that straddle 
the colony's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997. 
  China has repeatedly warned Hong Kong against pressing ahead 
with the airport without an agreement on financing arrangements 
as called for under a 1991 pact with Britain. 
  "We have always taken the view that it is much more 
constructive to discuss these issues in formal meetings of the 
airport committee, rather than through press statements," the 
spokesman said. 
  China's announcement came four days after Hong Kong's 
administration announced that it had offered to put an extra 
five billion Hong Kong dollars (646.83 million U.S.) into the 
airport in a bid to revive talks with Beijing on the project. 
  Hong Kong's financial secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, 
revealed 
the offer Friday as the colony's legislature approved 1.67 
billion dollars in stop-gap financing to keep work going on the 
airport. 
  Talks on the airport have stalled since Governor Chris 
Patten 
angered Beijing by launching his proposals to extend democracy 
in Hong Kong prior to 1997. 
  Although the Chinese statement expressed hope that talks 
would resume, it gave no direct response to a formal request 
from Britain Monday for a meeting of the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group, charged with deciding technical aspects of the 
1997 transition.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Violating Agreement Is Bound To Reap What It </F>
Has Sown"] 
  [Text] China and Britain have signed a series of 
agreements regarding the transfer of government which are 
serious and binding. Chris Patten, since his assumption of the 
governorship of Hong Kong, has simply been ignoring these 
binding agreements, doing whatever he wants to do, taking 
unilateral actions, undermining steady transition, and creating 
chaos with a view to extending British rule and gaining more 
colonial interests. The man who totally disregards the 
agreements may think himself very clever. But, in fact, what he 
has done will prove to be the most stupid trick, since British 
interests rest on the agreements between China and Britain, too. 
If the British forsake these agreements and take their own way, 
they will finally find out that British interests will be hurt, 
and Chris Patten will reap what he has sown. 
  As far as the airport issue is concerned, Chris Patten has 
always been playing the "piecemeal" appropriation tactics, 
acting first and reporting afterward, as he believes that what 
has been done cannot be undone. His trick is to let the excess 
in the construction costs keep accumulating and the "callable 
equity" keep aggregating, and then leave the awful mess to the 
special administrative region [SAR] government. 
  In doing so Chris Patten definitely has impaired the 
interests of Hong Kong people and totally violated the 
Sino-British memorandum on the new Hong Kong airport project. 
An airport project with constantly inflating construction costs 
will certainly be a project of high costs and poor returns. The 
new Hong Kong airport is not to be built with pounds Chris 
Patten brings from his home country. Therefore, he is not 
entitled to be generous at Hong Kong's expense and to dispose of 
Hong Kong people's money lavishly. The memorandum has ruled 
that the liabilities related to the airport construction to be 
left behind by the British Hong Kong Government shall not exceed 
Hong Kong $5 million. Now the increase in construction costs 
and repeated financial appropriations as a result of unilateral 
acts taken by the British Hong Kong Government will leave a 
HK$45 billion worth of liabilities to be borne by the SAR 
government after 1997, which will be more than nine times as 
much as the limit set by the memorandum. The British Hong Kong 
Government's financial appropriations in violation of the 
guideline on liabilities as prescribed by the memorandum are 
bound to arouse reaction from the Chinese side. In order to 
safeguard the interests of Hong Kong people, to ensure sound 
financing for the SAR government, and to achieve a steady 
transition, the Chinese side will have to take some 
precautionary measures. 
  In a statement made yesterday, the spokesman for the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council declared: 
Unless the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on the 
financing of the new Hong Kong airport project, 1) the Chinese 
side and the future SAR government will take no responsibility 
for any financial outlays and liabilities arising from the new 
airport project. 2) All land leases related to the new airport 
project and the revenues arising therefrom, including the 
airport reclamation and plots of land along the airport railway, 
are, with no exception, subject to negotiations and approval by 
the Sino-British Land Commission, in accordance with the 
provisions of Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
3) All contracts related to the new airport project, striding 
over 30 June 1997, and signed by the British Hong Kong 
Government without the prior consent of the Chinese side will be 
null and void as of 1 July 1997. 4) All legislation related to 
the new airport project passed in the British Hong Kong 
Legislative Council will be null and void as of 1 July 1997. 
  It is not that the Chinese side does not endorse the 
construction of the new airport. In fact, the Chinese side has 
so far approved the Central and Wanchai land reclamation 
projects and the Western cross-harbor tunnel project. The 
Chinese side's very intention is to ensure that all financial 
outlays conform with the memorandum, to minimize the huge amount 
of liabilities left over to the SAR government, and to urge the 
British side to return to the negotiating table and stop 
arbitrarily spending and appropriating. 
  With a financial surplus of over HK$100 billion, the British 
side now resorts to an idea of shifting liabilities onto the SAR 
government by encroaching on the SAR's land lease revenue and 
securing a huge amount of loans. This destructive [chai lan wu 
2135 3620 3064] behavior will undermine cooperation and steady 
transition. And the British side's purpose in doing so is to 
take away the money from Hong Kong people and turn it into 
staggering profits in British consortia's pockets. For example, 
the Chingma Bridge project promises a profit rate as high as 50 
percent. And that is the reason why the British cabinet 
committee does not hesitate to support Chris Patten in breaching 
agreements and acting recklessly during the late transitional 
period. 
  The practice to leave over to the SAR government an amount 
of 
liabilities nine times as much as the limit prescribed by the 
memorandum is a wishful thinking on the part of Chris Patten. 
But now the Chinese side has declared that it will not take any 
responsibility for such financial outlays and liabilities. This 
will warn international consortia not to be fooled by the 
British Hong Kong authorities and not to grant loans at risk. 
This actually will prevent the British from arbitrarily 
spending money and leaving huge debts to Hong Kong people. The 
British side is also trying to pave the way for acquiring 
greater economic benefits after 1997, by such means as 
reassignment, signing contracts, granting franchises, 
authorizing the airport corporation to grant land leases, and 
formulating the new airport corporation bill to make the 
corporation an "independent kingdom" and thus sidestep 
supervision. But any losses arising thereof will be borne by 
Hong Kong people. Therefore, the Chinese side will not possibly 
recognize any laws and ordinances, contracts, and franchises 
concerned before any agreement is reached. The purpose in doing 
so is to guard against the attempt by the British Hong Kong 
Government to anticipate and exhaust Hong Kong's financial 
resources. 
  Lots of historical facts, as well as what is taking place 
now, show that the British are trying to create chaos and then 
fish in troubled waters, making money by every means. The 
disputes between China and Britain on the airport issue are, in 
substance, an issue of whether to observe the memorandum in 
running the airport project or not and whether to handle 
transition affairs through negotiations and cooperation or not. 
Everyone who loves the motherland and Hong Kong will support 
the Chinese side's sensible, reasonable, and legal measures and 
oppose any arbitrary acts taken by the colonial authorities out 
of selfish consideration.

<F P=106> [By Keith Wallis] </F>
  [Text] Contractors and consultants working on the airport 
are unlikely to be directly hit by the threat to revoke all 
airport contracts in 1997. All work now underway is due to be 
completed by the June 30 deadline. 
  The Tsing Ma bridge, topped out on Monday, is slightly ahead 
of programme and well on course to be completed before June 
1997. The airport site reclamation work is also ahead of 
schedule, while construction of other key core projects, 
including the West Kowloon reclamation and the North Lantau 
expressway, is well advanced. 
  Trafalgar House, one of the companies in the Anglo-Japanese 
construction consortium building the Tsing Ma bridge, confirmed 
this. "As far as we are concerned, China's comments do not 
affect us, because the bridge will be handed over to the Hong 
Kong Government prior to June 1997," said Anthony Hasluck, a 
Trafalgar House spokesman in London. He said design and 
building firms working on the airport core projects were being 
paid by the Government as work progressed. 
  What China's comments may do is to deter companies from 
bidding for work which overlaps the handover. This almost 
certainly includes the airport railway, which has been delayed 
by more than a year. It could also affect the airport terminal, 
although the Provisional Airport Authority has appointed several 
companies to advise on how construction can be speeded up. But 
firms will want to see proof that China is serious about 
canceling contracts before they take action. Many are aware 
that this is the second time the Chinese authorities have 
threatened to cancel orders which straddle the 1997 handover. 
  China's statement also places a fresh question mark over the 
future of Container Terminal Nine. The Port Development Board 
has been waiting more than a year for the go-ahead from China to 
award the concession. Any further delay will place even more 
pressure on the existing facilities. 
  Interest in several of Hong Kong's other major 
infrastructure 
projects could also be torpedoed. Among these are the Country 
Park section of the Route 3 highway to China which has just gone 
out to tender; the strategic sewage disposal strategy and plans 
by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation to extend its heavy 
rail network. 
  But to what extent this happens depends on how companies 
interpret China's declaration, which said that only projects 
which had not been approved by the Chinese side would be 
revoked. So while the Central reclamation and Western Harbour 
Crossing are apparently unaffected by the Chinese threat, the 
position is less clear about Route 3 and the sewage disposal 
project, even though the Chinese authorities have given their 
tacit approval to both.

<F P=106> [Report by Fanny Wong] </F>
  [Excerpts] China last night brought on a showdown with the 
Hong Kong administration over the new airport, declaring that 
legal and financial obligations not approved by Beijing would be 
invalid after 1997. [passage omitted] 
  The Government has so far awarded 34 contracts worth a total 
of $31.4 billion. This represents 78 percent of the value of 
government airport core project contracts. It is understood all 
works under the 34 contracts will be completed before the 1997 
changeover, saving them from the impact from the declaration. 
The immediate victims are expected to be the franchises crucial 
to running the Chek Lap Kok facility, such as baggage and cargo 
handling, catering, air fuel supply and aircraft maintenance. 
  The Airport Corporation Bill, which is yet to be approved by 
the Legislative Council, would be invalidated in 1997. Even if 
the management corporation was approved and set up it could be 
dissolved. 
  Legislators last night accused the Chinese Government of 
reacting irrationally and dealing a blow to Hong Kong people's 
confidence. They warned that due consideration should be given 
to the possible impact on the community. The Government reacted 
more cautiously, saying only that it was still studying the 
XINHUA statement. 
  A spokesman said: "But meanwhile we must stress again that 
we have complied fully with the Memorandum of Understanding on 
the Airport Core Programme. 
  "The position is that we are awaiting a response from the 
Chinese side to our formal request for an early meeting of the 
Airport Committee, which we hope will resolve outstanding issues 
on the financing of the airport and the airport railway."

<F P=106> [By So Lai-Fun and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Legislators last night said China's latest 
declaration on the airport breached the 1991 Sino-British accord 
on the project. 
  The United Democrats' spokesman on airport and 
infrastructure, Albert Chan Wai-yip, rejected the statements by 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, calling it an 
"irrational" move. Mr Chan said the Chinese Government breached 
the agreement -- the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) -- under 
which both sides said they would co- operate on the construction 
of Chek Lap Kok. 
  He further criticised China's warning that it would declare 
airport-related legislation passed by the pre-1997 legislature 
invalid as disrespectful of the Basic Law. Mr Chan called on 
the two governments to reveal their interpretation of the 
memorandum and any exchanges that had taken place before the 
signing. Despite the threats from China, the United Democrats 
would continue to support the Government's funding request for 
the airport projects to give them a chance of being completed 
before the changeover, Mr Chan said. 
  Meeting Point's Fred Li Wah-ming said the statement was a 
heavy blow to the confidence of Hong Kong people. He said 
China's four point declaration carried an explicit warning that 
legislators should not approve any of the funding proposals put 
forward by the Government recently. Mr Li said his party would 
not bow to such pressure, added that continuing objections from 
China without concrete counter-proposals were of no help to the 
airport row. 
  While other political parties regarded China -- the future 
sovereign of Hong Kong -- as in a legitimate position to bring 
its threats into action, they said due consideration should be 
given to the impact on the community. 
  Describing the Chinese position as "unfortunate", Steven 
Poon 
Kwok-lim of the Liberal Party said it would inevitably harm the 
airport's construction. It would be more difficult for the 
project to move ahead if China displayed such an attitude, he 
said. 
  But Mr Poon said the declaration would not change his 
party's 
stance on the airport funding issue or the Airport Corporation 
Bill, the legislation governing the management body for the new 
airport. "The four-point declaration does not contradict our 
principles, we have stated very clearly that we would not agree 
to any funding requests that would leave any (financial) 
implications for the SAR [Special Administrative Region] 
government", he said. As for the airport bill, Mr Poon said the 
party's stance was that it would not give its consent without 
China's approval. 
  Frederick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for 
Democracy and People's Livelihood warned that the mainland 
statement could lead to further delay in the airport projects. 
It would create further hurdles in the search for financial 
support, he said. 
  Tam Yiu-chung of the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong said Britain should stop all funding 
requests until it received China's approval for the financing 
arrangements. "One central theme of the statement is that China 
as well as the future SAR will not shoulder any of the 
responsibility left over by the unilateral move of the Hong Kong 
British Government," Mr Tam said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by staff reporter Ming Chi-Liu (2494 0796 3177); </F>
"dispatched from Beijing 23 January": "There Will Be No 
`Legislative Vacuum' After 1997"] 
  [Text] Prompted by the British side's unilateral decision 
to submit the "partial constitutional reform bill," which 
violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and 
the agreements and understandings reached previously, to the 
Legislative Council, which has resulted in the derailing of the 
"through train," some Hong Kong people have alleged recently 
that there would be a "legislative vacuum" in Hong Kong after 
1997. The legal panel of the Preliminary Working Committee 
spent about five hours discussing relevant problems today and 
came to the conclusion that judging from the prospective of 
legal principles, there would be no such thing as a legislative 
vacuum in the future Special Administrative Region [SAR]. 
<H3>  The British Side's Noncooperation Is at the Root of the 
Problem </H3>
  Before commenting the panel's opinion, we should first of 
all 
discuss the legal logic of the so-called "legislative vacuum." 
Some people said: If the Chinese and British sides failed to 
reach agreement on Hong Kong's elections, which would cause the 
"through train" to be derailed, and accordingly the three-tier 
councils had to be re-established after 1 July 1997, there would 
certainly be a period when there were no legislative bodies, and 
when legislation would thus be suspended, before the SAR 
legislative council was set up. Again, since the SAR 
Legislative Council would not be established on 1 July 1997 and 
confirm Hong Kong's existing legal procedures, the SAR 
government would not provide sufficient legal basis for its 
operations. 
  We can discover loopholes in the above argument. First, the 
argument about a "legislative vacuum" is based on the hypothesis 
that there will certainly be no "through train." But this is 
unfounded according to legal principles, because the British 
side should replace its "three violations" bill with a "three 
conformities" one before the electoral law is passed or before 
elections are held according to the arrangements agreed. 
Therefore, the crux of the problem lies in whether the British 
side is willing to sincerely cooperate with the Chinese side, 
and not in whether there will be a "legislative vacuum." 
<H3>  Failure To Set Up the SAR Legislative Council Immediately 
After 1 July 1997 Does Not Mean a "Legislative Vacuum" </H3>
  Second, even if the "through train" should finally be 
derailed and the final Legislative Council under British rule 
were not to become the first SAR Legislative Council, this would 
only mean something being wrong with the convergence of the 
legislatures. The failure of the SAR Legislative Council to 
operate immediately after the 1 July 1997 and a "legislative 
vacuum" are issues of different natures, so they should not be 
mentioned in the same breath. Judging from the perspective of 
legal principles, a "legislative vacuum" means three things: 1) 
no legislation; 2) no laws; and 3) no legislative bodies. 
  According to legal principles in broad sense, a "legislative 
vacuum" refers to a legislative power vacuum of a government, 
which is exactly what the first content of a "legislative 
vacuum" refers to. But Article 2 of the Basic Law stipulates: 
"The National People's Congress [NPC] authorizes the Hong Kong 
SAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the 
provisions of this Law and to enjoy executive, legislative, and 
independent judicial power, including that of final 
adjudication," therefore so long as the Basic Law still exists 
when Hong Kong reverts to China on 1 July 1997 and so long as 
the SAR government is established without a hitch and has power 
vested in it by the NPC, the SAR will certainly enjoy inviolable 
legislative power. So fundamentally speaking, there will be no 
"legislative vacuum." 
  Third, Article 8 of the Basic Law provides: "The laws 
previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules 
of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary 
law shall be maintained, except for those that contravene this 
Law or have been amended by the legislature of the Hong Kong 
SAR." Clearly, though the SAR Legislative Council cannot be set 
up immediately after 1 July 1997, laws that do not contravene 
the Basic Law will remain in force, and this has been guaranteed 
by the Chinese Government. Therefore, if it was not considered 
that the existing over 500 laws and ordinances all contravened 
the Basic Law and thus must be scrapped, there would be no such 
problem as a legislative vacuum; and even though many existing 
laws and ordinances were found to be against the Basic Law, we 
would at most face a problem of insufficient laws and ordinances. 
  Let us now turn to the problem concerning the SAR 
Legislative 
Council. We are not now in a position to certify whether there 
will be a period when there will be no legislative bodies, 
because the method of setting up the first SAR Legislative 
Council has not been finalized. Nevertheless, if the SAR 
Legislative Council cannot be set up immediately after Hong Kong 
returns to Chinese sovereignty, it does not necessarily mean 
legislative work will be left undone. After all, the legislative 
body and legislative work are separate matters, and an equals 
sign should not be drawn between them. 
  Therefore, with the existing articles and stipulations, a 
"legislative vacuum" is unlikely in Hong Kong. 
<H3>  Actual Operations Will Eliminate the Likelihood of a 
"Legislative Vacuum" </H3>
  On the other hand, judging from the perspective of actual 
operations, even if the first SAR Legislative Council cannot be 
set up immediately after 1 July 1997, there will be only 
technicalities, and these technicalities will not develop into 
big problems. First, of the 10 functions of the SAR Legislative 
Council, only one is a legislative function, that is, "the SAR 
Legislative Council shall enact, repeal, or amend laws in 
accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law and legal 
procedures," while the other nine functions are related to 
supervision and appointments and removals. Second, the SAR will 
introduce the "executive-led" political system. Under the 
system the chief executive enjoys the power and function of 
issuing administrative orders, and the SAR government the power 
and function of "drafting and introducing bills, motions, and 
subsidiary legislation." Therefore, if the SAR Legislative 
Council cannot be set up immediately after 1 July 1997, it will 
not produce a big substantive impact. Also, the Basic Law 
authorizes the SAR Preparatory Committee to make any decisions 
to facilitate the establishment of the SAR. Related foreign 
experience shows that the preparatory committee for the 
establishment of a new government can eliminate the possibility 
of a "legislative vacuum." 
  To sum up, the best way to avoid a "legislative vacuum" is 
for the British side to withdraw the "three violations" bill and 
return to the course of cooperating with the Chinese side so 
that the two sides will jointly handle the problems related to 
the hand-over of political power. Even if things fail to turn 
out as expected, there will be no such problem as a "legislative 
vacuum" so long as the Basic Law exists. The biggest possible 
problem will only be that the SAR Legislative Council will not 
operate on the day political power changes hands. And 
experience in actual operations reveals that it is also not 
necessary for the SAR Legislative Council to do so.

<F P=106> [From Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] There would be no legal vacuum after the 1997 
change over despite the likely absence of a legislature for the 
first months, a China-appointed body has assured. 
  Speaking at the end of a two-day session, acting Hong Kong 
co- convenor of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) legal 
sub-group, Lo Tak-shing, said there were sufficient mechanisms 
in place to cope with any problems that arose during the 
transition. "We have a sovereign in power and a Basic Law in 
place. The Basic Law preserves all the existing laws of Hong 
Kong, except those which conflict with the Basic Law." 
  He said the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress had already empowered the Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) Preparatory Committee to do almost anything needed to 
prepare for the establishment of the first government. The 
legal sub-group's conclusion implied that it was possibly 
unnecessary to devise a mechanism to cope with any legal vacuum 
at July 1, 1997, he said. 
  "We have in place a complete structure and laws for the Hong 
Kong society. There is no problem at all." 
  The question of a legal vacuum was raised by the political 
sub- group in discussions of the formation of the first 
government and the first SAR legislature. Given the collapse of 
the Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements and the need to 
hold fresh elections by mid-1997, some members feared that Hong 
Kong would have no legislature for several months after July 1 
997. They suggested interim measures such as forming a 
provisional legislature, allowing the National People's Congress 
to legislate on behalf of Hong Kong or delegating legislative 
power to the SAR chief executive. The political sub-group will 
meet on Friday and Saturday in Beijing. 
  Mr Lo said it was a misunderstanding that the absence of a 
legislature in 1997 would mean that there would be no laws in 
Hong Kong or no mechanism to enact legislation. "The fact is 
that the SAR Preparatory Committee can rule Hong Kong in 
accordance with Hong Kong laws," he said. 
  Mainland co-convenor Shao Tianren said there would be no 
vacuum in the transition as China would resume sovereignty over 
Hong Kong immediately on July 1, 1997. "There exists no legal 
vacuum," Mr Shao said. Mr Shao said few laws would need to be 
changed because they failed to comply with the Basic Law. 
Changes would mainly be amending terms such as "colonial", 
"your majesty" and "governor". 
  But Preliminary Working Committee member Tam Yiu-chung held 
reservations, saying it was difficult to determine so early that 
there would not be a legal vacuum.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 18 (AFP)--Hong Kong's biggest press 
group launches Tuesday the territory's third English-language 
daily -- planned to reach the stands next month -- with an 
independent editorial stance as its selling point. 
  "We're ready to start publishing on February 1," said Steve 
Vines, the new paper's editor, who claimed the EASTERN EXPRESS 
-- owned by the Oriental Press Group -- would be "independently 
minded" with no political affiliations. 
  Local analysts have welcomed the emergence of a new English- 
language newspaper, with many saying the newspaper had taken the 
best selling point by insisting on its independence at this 
politically sensitive time. 
  While, in theory, a free press flourishes in Hong Kong, in 
the transition to China's takeover of the British colony in 
1997, the future of the press remains uncertain. 
  As a result, some dailies are shifting stances towards 
China, 
with many engaging in self-censorship to avoid offending 
Beijing, giving the EASTERN EXPRESS the chance to exploit the 
psychological advantage of being "neutral." 
  The two established English-language dailies have taken 
notice of the market newcomer, changing formats and offering 
giveaways in an effort to keep their readers from deserting to 
the EASTERN EXPRESS. 
  The market leader SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST -- which Tuesday 
touted its spruced up "bigger, better" business pages -- is 
offering nine Mercedes Benz cars in a competition for its 
readers. 
  The HONG KONG STANDARD has also radically changed its format 
and logo, and now offers a weekly colour magazine and the CHINA 
DAILY'S BUSINESS WEEKLY as a supplement every Monday. 
  "We are delighted by the response from our competitors," 
Vines said. "We will have a place in the market," he said 
confidently. 
  The ORIENTAL EXPRESS [as published] has bought German-made 
presses at a cost of 24 million dollars which will print more 
than twice as fast and with about the third of the labour of 
current presses in use here. 
  The new daily plans an initial circulation of 60,000 copies 
a 
day. 
  Its sister publication, the Chinese-language ORIENTAL DAILY, 
currently claims a readership of 1.6 million. 
  The emergence of the new newspaper followed the purchase by 
Chinese-Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok -- who has substantial 
business interests in China -- of a 24.9 percent stake in the 
SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. 
  Kuok's acquisition prompted fears the SOUTH CHINA MORNING 
POST would adopt a more pro-China stance, although the reclusive 
entrepreneur has said he planned no change in its editorial 
policy. 
  The Chinese language press ranges from pro-Beijing to 
pro-Taiwan. 
  The launching of the EASTERN EXPRESS adds to the colony's 
existing 67 newspapers and 608 periodicals -- including 39 
Chinese- language dailies and two English-language dailies -- 
the world's highest rate of newspapers per person. 
  Timothy Hamlett, a media lecturer at the Baptist College, 
said the new newspaper would give Hong Kong an average of two 
and a half newspapers per person in the colony of six million 
people. 
  But, he said, despite the saturated press industry, "the 
launching of a third English-language daily is worth 
experimenting" with. 
  "There is an obvious temptation to take the non-left wing 
stance," he said, "whether it will work is another question." 
  "It is a fantastic development," said media analyst James 
Miles of Asia Equity, but he predicted it would take at least 
six months to see whether the newspaper was profitable. 
  "It will offer more choice to consumers," said media analyst 
Kirk Sweeney of Lehman Brothers. 
  "It remains to be seen whether the editorial policy will be 
independent," he added.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by unidentified XINHUA commentator: "Criminal </F>
Hijackers of Aircraft Must Be Sternly Punished"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Sun Xianlu, a criminal 
who used violence to hijack a plane, was sentenced to life in 
prison and was stripped of his political rights for life. He 
deserves such a punishment. 
  For a while, some criminals have resorted to using violence 
and terrorist acts to hijack Chinese civilian passenger aircraft 
to Taiwan, thus seriously endangering aircraft passengers' lives 
and property, jeopardizing flight safety, and creating 
abominable influences on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as well 
as throughout the world. 
  Hijacking civilian aircraft is a terrorist act that 
seriously 
threatens people's lives and safety. This kind of act is in 
violation of Chinese law, and all countries and regions 
throughout the world consider it a serious crime and impose 
stern punishments on plane hijackers. International conventions 
in this regard contain stipulations for dealing with plane 
hijackings; all countries and regions of the world have the 
obligation to crack down on aircraft hijackings. 
  Why have aircraft hijackings occurred so frequently across 
the Taiwan Strait? By recalling the few aircraft hijackings 
over the last few years, any person with a sense of justice and 
without political prejudice can see that the reason why plane 
hijackings have occurred so frequently is simply because of the 
Taiwan authorities' connivance with and giving unprincipled 
protection to hijackers. It is simply the Taiwan authorities' 
giving unprincipled protection to aircraft hijackers that has 
finally resulted in abominable consequences, and these 
abominable consequences have not only brought suffering to some 
mainland people but have also brought misfortune to some Taiwan 
compatriots. On 2 October 1992, Jiang Xiaofeng attempted to 
hijack a plane to Taiwan. This resulted in a disaster that 
killed 128 people, including 30 Taiwan compatriots; that injured 
53 people, and that destroyed three planes. Zhuo Changren and 
his partners, who hijacked a plane to Korea in May 1983 and who 
were later received by Taiwan, joined the black society in 
Taiwan and kidnapped and killed a man, thus posing a danger to 
the people in Taiwan. This incident also proves that aircraft 
hijackings have also brought misfortune to Taiwan compatriots. 
  As for the issue of how mainland hijackers of aircraft are 
treated, although the Taiwan authorities have changed their 
attitude of considering plane hijackers to be "anticommunist 
heroes" and have sentenced the criminals Huang Shugang and Liu 
Baocai, who hijacked a plane to Taiwan on 6 April 1993, to 10 
years in prison and have sentenced the plane hijackers Zhang 
Wenlong, Yang Mingde, and Han Fengying to six to nine years in 
prison; and although Taiwan's procuratorate has demanded that 
some other mainland plane hijackers be sentenced to 12 years or 
more in prison, these sentences, as has been pointed out by 
Taiwan's media, are too lenient for such serious crimes, even 
when using Taiwan's "law" as the criterion. 
  The Taiwan authorities' arguments for refusing to repatriate 
plane hijackers not only cannot not hold water but also are 
ridiculous. One of their arguments is the so-called 
"humanitarian considerations." In fact, plane hijackers use 
passengers as hostages in an attempt to serve their evil 
purposes, thus seriously jeopardizing passengers' lives and 
flight safety. Therefore, only the stern punishment of criminal 
hijackers of aircraft can ensure passengers' safety, which is 
truly humanitarian. Another thing is that, in dealing with 
plane hijackers, the Taiwan authorities still focus on the 
motive for the crime, thinking that, objectively speaking, the 
hijackers' cases deserve sympathy. Actually, in a society ruled 
by law, the decision concerning any crime should be strictly 
based on the facts of the crime. Moreover, according to the 
investigations conducted by our departments concerned and by the 
Taiwan police, some criminal aircraft hijackers were people who 
were on the run for embezzling public funds, some were habitual 
gamblers who were on the run because of their inability to pay 
their gambling debts, some were people who ran away from paying 
their business debts, some were suspects in major burglaries, 
and some were people who hoped to go to Taiwan to get rich and 
enjoy themselves. 
  Not only some people with insight and the news media of 
Taiwan have denounced all these practices of the Taiwan 
authorities. Taiwan's police and procuratorial authorities, who 
have handled the various plane hijackings, have also have been 
bothered by the frequent hijackings and have openly suggested to 
the Taiwan authorities that "plane hijackers be sent back to the 
mainland after they are tried," saying that "otherwise, the evil 
trend will never be stopped." 
  Our opinion is that to fundamentally solve the problem of 
hijacking planes to Taiwan and to reduce aircraft hijackings to 
the minimum or to completely prevent such incidents from 
occurring, the most direct and effective way is for the Taiwan 
authorities to repatriate and hand over all criminal hijackers 
to the mainland. Here is something that is noteworthy: In their 
working consultations, the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation have 
reached a common understanding -- that is, plane hijackers 
across the strait must be repatriated. 
  We hope that the Taiwan authorities will sincerely put aside 
the political and legal problems that cannot be solved for the 
time being and, with a pragmatic attitude, find a way that is 
acceptable to both sides so that an agreement on repatriating 
plane hijackers can be reached at an early date. We hope that 
the Taiwan authorities will make practical efforts to thoroughly 
prevent plane hijackings across the Taiwan Strait. Only by 
doing so can the Taiwan authorities make themselves not guilty 
both to history and to compatriots on both sides of the strait.

<F P=106> [Article by LIAOWANG WEEKLY reporters Fang Jinyu (2455 6651 </F>
3768) and Li Dahong (2621 1129 1347): "People Across the Strait 
Say `No' to Hijackers"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- According to the Civil 
Aviation General Administration, it began implementing new 
stipulations on security checks since the middle of last 
November on passenger airliners serving the southeastern coastal 
regions. These include: a strict check of passengers, opening 
and checking passengers' limited hand-carried luggage, and 
forbidding passengers to carry aboard any hand tools and cutlery 
which could be used to hijack aircraft. 
  A responsible person at the Civil Aviation General 
Administration told us that the administration was forced to 
make this decision, and he called for the understanding of all 
domestic and foreign passengers. 
  Behind the Civil Aviation General Administration's 
unprecedentedly strict decision, which nearly borders on 
"harassment," lies a shocking fact: China's passenger airliners 
were hijacked several times in 1993 by criminals from different 
spots in China to the same Chinese airport -- Taibei's [Taipei] 
Taoyuan Airport! 
  People cannot help wondering: Are there really any benefits 
to be reaped from hijacking planes to Taibei? Who is "to blame" 
for the constantly occurring cross-strait hijackings? 
<H5>  "Memorandum" for Cross-Strait Hijackings </H5>
  Cross-strait hijackings can be traced back 10 years. 
  Only two passenger planes were hijacked across the strait in 
the early 1980's. On 25 July 1982, a China Civil Aviation 
airliner was hijacked by Sun Zhiping and other four mainland 
criminals. Crew members, assisted by passengers, fought bravely 
with the criminals. One of the criminals was killed and the 
other four were arrested. Seven crew members and passengers were 
wounded. The hijacking attempt was foiled. 
  On 5 May 1983, Zhuo Changren and five others, after shooting 
and wounding crew members, hijacked a mainland passenger plane 
to South Korea. Zhuo Changren and the other criminals were 
brought to Taiwan without having fully served their prison terms 
in South Korea and were deemed "anticommunist heroes." What was 
most "dramatic" about the Zhuo Changren case was that in the 
very beginning Taiwan thought that the mainland had "lost face 
greatly." But now, even the former Taiwan "ambassador" to South 
Korea regrets that Taiwan "made such a great effort to bring a 
bunch of murderers to Taiwan." 
  Facts have shown that all hijackers are cruel and violent. 
He who "loses face" is precisely the party that "shelters the 
hijackers." 
  In the mid-1980's, it was "all quiet" on the two sides of 
the 
strait. 
  On 12 May 1988, the mainland criminals Zhang Qingguo and 
Long 
Guiyun hijacked and forced a mainland plane to land on a Taiwan 
military airfield. It should be noted that the plane hijacked 
by Zhang Qingguo and Long Guiyun was the first mainland 
passenger aircraft to be directly hijacked to and landed in 
Taiwan. As usual, Zhang Qingguo and Long Guiyun said that their 
reason for the hijacking was "to seek freedom." But the 
treatment they received from the Taiwan authorities was: no 
title of "anticommunist hero," no cash award, and a 
three-and-a-half-year prison term, with their being "paroled" 
after serving 21 months and being allowed to "settle" in Taiwan. 
  In December 1989, the criminal Zhang Zhenghai hijacked a 
passenger plane destined for Taiwan, but the plane was forced to 
land in Fukuoka, Japan. Japan did not allow him to proceed to 
Taiwan. Zhang Zhenghai was repatriated to the mainland to stand 
trial. He was given an eight-year prison sentence. 
  It should be said that although the hijackings by Zhuo 
Changren, Zhang Qingguo, and Long Guiyun, as well as the shelter 
given to them by and the connivance of the Taiwan authorities 
did not produce for mainland civil aviation a tragedy of plane 
crashes and human casualties, these did indeed "set up" an 
extremely dangerous "time bomb." To the mainland's criminal 
elements, the Taiwan authorities' actions are like their sending 
them this "message: "If you hijack a plane to Taiwan, all you 
have to do is to `sit' in prison for several years and then you 
may be allowed to `settle' on the island." 
  This "time bomb" finally exploded on 2 October 1990. 
  On that day, the criminal Jiang Xiaofeng, when he realized 
that the captain, far from following his "hijacking order," had 
landed the plane at Guangzhou's Baiyun airport, in a rage beat 
the captain, caused the hijacked plane to collide with two other 
planes parked on the runway, and created a great tragedy in 
which 128 people were killed, 53 people were injured, and the 
three planes were completely destroyed. Not only mainland 
people and the mainland civil aviation company were victims of 
this hijacking tragedy; 30 Taiwan compatriots also perished in 
that incident. Compatriots on both sides of the strait were 
greatly shocked! This incident caused an uproar among the 
international public. 
<H5>  The Kind of People Hijackers Are </H5>
  In 1990, Taiwan's relevant authority, yielding to the 
pressure of public opinion, announced that Taiwan would not 
welcome hijackers and anyone hijacking a plane to Taiwan would 
be promptly repatriated. Hence, the sky across the Strait was 
quiet for a while. However, the Taiwan authority did not keep 
its words. Following the hijacking on 4 April 1993, Taiwan, 
instead of promptly repatriating the hijackers, emphasized the 
"judicial jurisdiction" and "kept" the criminals in Taibei. 
Thereafter, the cross-strait sky has not been so quiet. 
Although the Taiwan authority failed to keep the promise, 
people began to notice some "improvement" in Taiwan's handling 
of hijackers. 
  Did the series of hijackers from the mainland really have a 
sweet taste of their "fruits" in Taibei? A review of hijackers' 
criminal records in the mainland and their "comic" show in 
Taibei would set people roaring with laughter. 
  Take hijackers Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai for instance. It 
has been verified by our Public Security Ministry that criminal 
Huang is the culprit of a major graft case involving over 
200,000 yuan. When he was brought to the court in Taibei, he 
had the audacity to beg the police to remove his handcuffs 
during public appearance. As he said, he would never dream of 
becoming a "captive" when he hijacked the plane to Taibei. 
Hence, we can see from this single instance the whole picture 
of the depicable, pitiful, ludicrous face of hijackers. 
  Let us take a further look at more recent hijackers. 
  Hijacker Shi Yuebo (a self-employed man from Xiaoli 
Township, 
Rongcheng County in Hebei Province), who had no previous 
criminal record, hijacked a plane to Taibei 10 August because he 
was in arrears of a 150,000 yuan-loan he had obtained through 
illicit connections. 
  Yang Mingde and Han Fengying were the couple who hijacked a 
plane 30 September. Yang, after resigning from a forestry farm 
in the northeast, took his wife and son to Shandong's Dongying 
City to set up a family-run business. Due to poor management, 
he was in debt for more than 10,000 yuan. He thought hijacking 
would be a "good way out." 
  Zhang Hai, who hijacked a plane 5 November, was a former 
driver of the Tangshan City Government. In the late eighties, 
his mother visited her father, who lives in Taiwan. According 
to Taiwan press reports, Zhang's maternal grandparents had sent 
tens of thousands of dollars to help his mother in recent years. 
In his confession in Taiwan, Zhang boasted of spending as much 
as over 10,000 yuan at song and dance halls in a single night. 
Furthermore, Taiwan's LIAN HE BAO [LIEN HE PAO] cited Zhang 
Hai, who had left behind his aging mother and infant son, as 
saying after arriving in Taibei: I have come to my maternal 
grandfather for help. However, both his grandfather and uncle 
told reporters that they did not want to see him. 
  Wang Zhihua, who hijacked a plane on 8 November, was very 
straightforward. Upon the hijacked plane's arrival in Taibei, 
he told the Taiwan police: I had a fight with my plant director; 
therefore, I hijacked the plane. Later he said: As I had 
committed a crime in the mainland, I hijacked the plane before 
the mainland police could get me. It is understood that culprit 
Wang, age 36 and a native of Heilongjiang's Hulan County, is a 
former worker of the Harbin No. 4 Pharmaceutical Plant. There 
is evidence of him embezzling 80,000 yuan; and he is suspected 
of a major larceny case.... 
  Li Xiangyu and Han Shuxue, who hijacked a plane on 12 
November, committed the crime also to evade debts. It is 
understood that Li, divorced and living by himself, is a former 
studio employee in Jilin's Tongyu County. In 1991 when he set 
up the "Donggang Tourist Company," he borrowed a 22,000 yuan 
loan with two guarantors. However, when the loan repayment was 
due, he could not make it. Hence, the two guarantors filed a 
lawsuit with the court which ruled that Li should auction his 
house to repay the loan. On 5 November, Li sold his house for 
15,000 yuan and told friends he was going to "fly far and high." 
Han, a hospital doctor of the same county and who has been 
divorced twice and is living by himself, reportedly has incurred 
heavy debts.... 
  Taiwan's newspapers have portrayed hijackers from the 
mainland as ill-informed and poorly educated people shouting 
political slogans to pursue individualistic aims. 
  Zhang Xin, senior honorific research of the Chinese 
University of Hong Kong, has incisively pointed out: To 
alleviate the trouble for Taiwan and reduce the hostility 
between the two sides of the Strait, the Taiwan authorities 
should turn hijackers over to the mainland. 
<H5>  Taiwan's Public Opinion Says: "We Do Not Welcome Hijackers!" </H5>
  On 7 April 1993, shortly after the first plane hijacking 
last 
year, "legislators" Yu Zhengxian and Zeng Zhennong of Taiwan's 
"Legislative Yuan" publicly said: Huang and Liu should be 
repatriated to the mainland to avoid covert encouragement of 
plane hijacking and letting people think that Taiwan is a 
paradise for hijackers. 
  On 11 August last year, Taiwan's FREEDOM TIMES [TZU YOU SHIH 
PAO] carried an editorial, entitled: "Say `No' to Plane 
Hijackers!" The editorial pointed out: "Hijacking should not be 
allowed for whatever the reason." The Taiwan authorities 
"should make a solemn statement to oppose the act of hijacking" 
and should "severely punish hijackers so as to clear Taiwan's 
reputation of being a 'paradise' for plane hijackers." 
  Taiwan's police and procuratorates, which have been kept 
constantly on the run by handling those cases, repeately 
expressed that the authorities should "repatriate plane 
hijackers to the mainland after trying them" for "otherwise such 
an evil practice cannot be stopped." 
  Regretfully, owing to the fact that those plane hijackers 
were not sent back to the mainland, several more plane hijacking 
cases happened in April, June, August, and until the end of last 
year. Taiwan's public opinion came to the end of its patience. 
A young teacher sent a letter, entitled: "Hijacking Again, How 
Annoying!" to Taiwan's CHINA TIMES [CHUNG KUO SHIH PAO]. 
  Now we should clearly understand two things. 
  1. Who "started the trouble" and caused the frequent 
happening of such "farce" between the two sides of the Straits? 
  Cultural worker Li Suosi wrote an article for Taiwan's 
UNITED 
DAILY [LIEN HO PAO], pointing out: "Now we are all very angry 
and almost want to immediately dump those hijackers into the 
ocean. But have we realized that these are the results of our 
encouraging mainlanders for 40 years? We broadcasted the news 
and welcomed and gave them rewards. Later, we gave them light 
sentence and tolerated them. Only in the most recent year, have 
we really "said" that we would sentence them to 10 years of 
imprisonment. Those who were not informed still want to come. 
Whom shall we blame?" 
  2. After knowing who started the trouble, we know who shall 
be responsible for ending the trouble. 
  "To fundamentally solve the problem, the most straitforward 
method is to send those hijackers back to the mainland and stop 
their intention to remain here." Businessman Li Lan of Taiwan's 
Yilan [Ilan] City wrote an article in Taiwan's newspaper, 
entitled: "Only by Repatriating Hijackers Can the Sky Be Safe." 
He pointed out in his article: "We firmly believe that only 
when those desperadoes know that hijackers will also face the 
destiny of being sent back can civil aviation be safe on both 
sides of the Straits!" 
  Taiwan's MIN SHENG PAO reminded the Taiwan authorities: 
Conniving at plane hijacking and treating hijackers kindly "will 
be a big obstacle to establishing mutual trust between the two 
sides of the Straits and will be unfavorable to effective and 
positive exchanges between the two sides." The consequences 
would be very worrisome. 
  According to reports by Taiwan's newspapers, once those 
hijackers saw Taiwan's newspapers, most of them were "upset" and 
"scared stiff." Some of Taiwan's police forces suggested that 
those plane hijackers should not be allowed to see newspapers. 
<H5>  Civil Aviation on the Mainland Are Adopting Emergent Measures </H5>
  The Civil Aviation General Administration of China (CAAC) 
has 
been making great development for more than 10 years since the 
beginning of reform and opening up. It has made particularly 
rapid progress in recent years at a rate of expanding by over 30 
percent annually. It has bought many planes, opened many flight 
routes, and employed many new workers. People can see the 
contributions made by CAAC to economic development on the 
mainland and to exchanges between the two sides of the Straits. 
However, both hardware and software somehow cannot keep up with 
the rapid development. 
  However, one thing is quite certain: CAAC has always 
attached great importance to the question of flying safety to 
protect civil air transportation and insure the safety of 
passengers and airplanes. In particular, since the beginning of 
this year, in view of the frequent hijacking of planes to 
Taiwan, CAAC appropriated 100 million yuan for the procurement 
of additional security instruments and facilities (including 
relatively advanced X-ray machines and security inspection doors 
generally used by civil airports of various countries) for 
various airports despite the tight budget. CAAC has also 
strengthened professional training for ground and air security 
personnel in light of the situation. 
  It was learned that CAAC has provided special equipment, 
which can be used to restrain hijackers without endangering 
flying safety, for airplane security personnel. CAAC has 
warned, transferred, or dismissed a number of staff members and 
workers who were held responsible for the hijacking incidents 
last year. 
  It was also learned that due to resolute measures adopted by 
the CAAC, several plane hijacking attempts were foiled on the 
mainland last year. On 26 November 1993, hijacker Gao 
Guangkai's hijacking scheme was foiled. 
  A responsible CAAC person hoped to make an apology to the 
broad masses of passengers through news media. He said: To 
effectively insure flying safety for Chinese and foreign 
passengers, passengers of various flights to or passing 
southeast coastal areas will be subject to special inspection. 
He hoped that passengers would understand the situation and 
cooperate with the action taken by CAAC. He especially stressed 
that simply relying on strengthening safety inspection cannot 
totally prevent the scheme of hijackers and that the most 
fundamental and effective way is to repatriate all plane 
hijackers from Taiwan and stop making Taiwan a paradise for 
hijackers. 
  Are not the words of this official right? Business Liu 
Changyuan of Taiwan's Jilong [Keelung] City said in a newspaper 
article: If we blame the mainland for all the reasons of plane 
hijacking, then we should ask why those hijackers only choose to 
fly to Taiwan and not to other places? Besides, the items used 
by several hijackers could not be detected by general safety 
inspection prodecures. How can we blame the mainland for not 
being thorough in flying safety inspections? Must they take 
measures to the point of annoying all passengers? 
  It is hoped that Chinese and foreign tourists would, like 
Mr. 
Liu, understand why CAAC cannot but adopt temporary safety 
inspection measures to the point of "annoying passengers." 
<H5>  Plane Hijackers "Met with Misfortune" in Taibei </H5>
  News from Taiwan at end of 1993 reported that hijacker Gao 
Jun tried to commit suicide at a detention house. After racking 
his brains in scheming the plane hijacking, why did he want to 
commit suicide shortly after arriving in Taibei? Gao Jun's 
"performance" merits attention and thinking by a small number of 
lawless people on the mainland who assume that hijacking a plane 
can bring them benefits. 
  At 0200 in the wee hours of the morning of 23 December, five 
other prisoners living in the same room with Gao Jun at the 
Taibei [Taipei] Taoyuan Detention House had already fallen 
asleep. Only Gao Jun sat there and could not sleep. A watcher 
asked him why he could not sleep, Gao Jun said with staring eyes 
that he could not sleep because he had swallowed batteries and 
his stomach ached. The watcher was frightened and rushed him to 
a hospital. An X-ray examination showed he indeed had hard 
stuffs in his stomach. It was learned that Gao Jun swallowed 
two No. 4 batteries and the handle of a toothbrush. Gao Jun was 
kept in the hospital for observation and then sent back to a 
prison after doctors confirmed he would be all right. According 
to the analysis of Taiwan police, the reasons why Gao Jun 
committed suicide were: 1) His girl friend did not know about 
his hijacking scheme and was forced to return to the mainland on 
the same plane by Taiwan's police following his hijacking of the 
plane. Gao Jun was "hurt" and had high blood pressure. 2) He 
did not think that, after "flying" to Taibei, he would be put 
into a jail. When he was sent to the Taiyuan Detention House 
for "routine health examination," it was found that he had high 
blood pressure and was emotionally very unstable. It was 
learned that Taibei police are conducting "psychological 
guidance" for him. 
  Is it difficult or not difficult to solve the problem of 
frequent cross-strait plane hijackings? 
  The answer is: not difficult. Now, the measures that should 
be taken by the Taiwan side are simple and convenient. All they 
have to do is to send back all criminals involved in previous 
aircraft hijackings. Naturally, if the Taiwan side announces 
publicly after repatriating all hijackers that from now on all 
people who hijack airplanes to Taiwan will be repatriated, and 
if the mainland side also makes great efforts to coordinate and 
publicize Taiwan's announcement through the mainland's mass 
media, then all vicious and stupid people on the mainland cannot 
but think twice before carrying out such heinous crimes as 
aircraft hijackings. 
  At the end of 1993, the Taiwan authorities held several days 
of a "cross-ministerial" conference. Wu Boxiong [Wo Po-hsiung], 
the convener of the Executive Yuan's "policy group for 
countering aircraft hijackings," finally announced that Taiwan's 
"Executive Yuan" has decided to repatriate plane hijackers so as 
to eliminate the possibility of aircraft hijackers' remaining in 
Taiwan. Bu Boxiong told Taiwan's reporters: "At present, plane 
hijackers can remain in Taiwan after serving their prison 
sentences. We must stop this kind of practice, which is an 
incentive." 
  In early 1994, news from Taibei said: Following the 
sentencing of Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai to 10 years in 
prison, the hijacker Zhang Wenlong was sentenced to nine years 
in prison, Yang Mingde was sentenced to nine years in prison, 
and Yang's wife Han Fengying was sentenced to six years in 
prison. Taiwan's procurators demanded that Zhang Hai, Li 
Xiangyu, Han Shuxue, and others be sentenced to more than 12 
years. The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation reached a common 
understanding in their routine discussion: that in principle, 
all aircraft hijackers of the two sides must be repatriated. 
  Even though the Taiwan authorities have made a decision on 
repatriating plane hijackers because of the strong demand of the 
people of the island, people believe what is more important is 
that the Taiwan authorities must implement the decision as 
quickly as possible.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY 
[RENMIN RIBAO], in an editorial to be published tomorrow, 
stresses the importance of speeding up infrastructure 
construction according to China's capabilities. 
  While acknowledging that infrastructure construction is 
booming all over the country, the editorial warns against the 
tendency in some localities of paying no heed to objective 
conditions, neglecting economic returns and blindly seeking big 
projects and construction speed. 
  It criticizes some areas for failing to implement a national 
unified construction plan, undertaking redundant projects and 
over- extending the construction scale. 
  "These malpractices are detrimental to the healthy 
cultivation of a socialist market economy, the rational 
distribution of natural resources, the display of comprehensive 
economic returns and the coordinated growth of China's economy 
as a whole, and even have damaged national interests," the 
editorial says. 
  The country's leading newspaper also stresses the impOrtance 
of seeking truth from facts in doing everything. "In doing so, 
we must do everything in our power, and more importantly act 
according to our capabilities," it points out. 
  The undertaking of major infrastructure projects is crucial 
to the overall distribution of the national economy and the 
overall supply-demand balance of the macro-economy, it says. 
  That is why it is imperative to subject these projects to a 
national unified construction plan, it adds. 
  In undertaking infrastructure projects, it is also necessary 
to pay close attention both to social efficiency and economic 
returns, the editorial says. 
  Everything possible must "e done to step up the construction 
of those infrastructure facilities badly needed to spur China's 
economic growth, it stresses. 
  However, it is also necessary to build such facilities in an 
orderly and step-by-step way, it adds. 
  With a relatively low level of economic development, China 
will face the problem of insufficient financial resources and 
supply shortages of materials for a long time to come, it says. 
  "Therefore, we ought to concentrate on the construction of 
top- priority infrastructure facilities, while doing our best to 
prevent waste resulting from redundant and blind construction," 
it says.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Companies Required To Renew Their </F>
Trademarks"] 
  [Text] Officials yesterday warned companies that they must 
renew their trademarks before they expire. 
  Companies that do not meet the deadline will have their 
trademarks invalidated, said an official in charge of the 
country's trademark registration. 
  A large number of Chinese companies have failed to renew 
their property rights according to the Trademark Law. 
  "More than 85,000 trademarks passed their 10-year legal 
validity term last March, and about 50,000 owners failed to 
apply for re- registration by last September," said the 
official, who refused to be named. 
  Expired trademarks become nullified after 10 years and are 
no 
longer protected by law. 
  The official urged companies to reregister their trademarks 
as soon as possible before use of them becomes illegal. 
  According to the Chinese Trademark Law, issued in 1983, a 
registered trademark is valid for 10 years, and re-registration 
is required six months prior to the expiration date. A grace 
period of six months after the expiration date is permitted, 
though firms that delay must pay a fine. 
  "Trademarks that are not re-registered become illegal and 
products bearing the marks will no longer be allowed to be 
sold," the official said. 
  The official added that many companies, especially those in 
rural areas, have stopped using their trademarks without 
informing the government. 
  Experts have also attributed the failure to re-register on 
poor trademark management and uninformed owners. 
  They urged enterprises to check the expiration date of their 
trademarks and re-register immediately if they are overdue. 
  In the first nine months of last year, the State 
administration and its local branches handled 27,000 cases of 
trademark infringement, statistics show. 
  And as of last September, the bureau said there were 395,000 
authorized trademarks in the country. Domestic firms accounted 
for 340,000, and foreign firms--from Kodak of the US to Sony of 
Japan- accounted for 55,000. 
  The administration has set up 63 branch offices nationwide 
to 
handle trademark registration.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "More Firms To List Stock Abroad"] </F>
  [Text] More domestic enterprises are expected to be listed 
on overseas securities exchanges this year in a move to draw 
more foreign capitals into China. 
  Most will appear on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said Zhu 
Li, a spokesman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission 
(CSRC). 
  The others will be listed on US securities exchanges or in 
other countries. 
  These large State-owned enterprises will mainly come from 
the 
field of energy, transportation and telecommunications. 
  Some of them need capitals to conduct technical renovation, 
he said, To attract overseas investors, they must be profitable 
and have promising development potentiality. 
  Zhu said new overseas-listed firms this year would not issue 
A shares in the domestic securities market. 
  This is not expected to result in too much pressure on the 
domestic market, which has been complaining about the 
over-expansion of listed firms. 
  China last year chose nine companies to be listed on the 
Hong 
Kong exchange. 
  To date, six companies are actually listed on the Hong Kong 
exchange. They are Shanghai Petrochemical, Qingdao Brewery, 
Guangzhou Shipyard, Beiren Printing Machinery, Kunming Machine 
Tool, and Maanshan Iron and Steel. 
  Another three are expected to be listed on the overseas 
market during the first half of this year. They are Dongfang 
Electric Company, Tianjin Bohai Chemical, and Jiangsu Yizheng 
Chemicals. 
  The overseas listing of domestic firms is an effective way 
to 
raise foreign capital, it helps Chinese firms transform their 
operations into real shareholding firms . 
  Before they enter the international market, domestic firms 
have to change their accounting system to meet international 
standards. 
  And they usually get help from foreign banks, securities 
firms, law firms and accounting firms. 
  To ensure smooth sailing of the new overseas listings, CSRC 
and Hong Kong Stock Exchange will jointly sponsor a seminar in 
Wuhan, Hubei Province, on Wednesday. 
  Some related institutions will introduce the procedures of 
listing in Hong Kong. And the already-listed firms will explain 
their experiences. 
  Earlier this month, CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru and the head of 
he Hong Kong exchange went to he United States and Britain to 
talk about the Hong Kong and mainland securities market. 
  In another development, CSRC yesterday published a circular 
to standardize the annual financial reports of listed companies.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "China To Issue New Paperless Treasury </F>
Bonds"] 
  [Text] China is in the process of issuing half and 
one-year- term paperless treasury bonds in a move to finance key 
construction projects. 
  According to sources from the Ministry of Finance, the 
half-year- term bonds will carry an annual interest rate of 9.8 
per cent and the interest will be counted starting January 25. 
  The annual interest rate for the one-year treasury bonds 
will 
be 11.9 per cent. The interest will be counted as of February 7. 
  Meanwhile, the paperless bonds are also expected to be 
traded 
on the Shanghai Securities Exchange after the conclusion of the 
issuance, which will be January 30 for the half-year bonds and 
February 7 for the one year. 
  Underwriters of the bonds are securities companies, trust 
and 
investment companies and banks. 
  Paperless treasury bonds refer to transactions conducted 
entirely through computer systems. 
  Such bonds generally are sold to institutional buyers and 
individual investors who plan big investments in this field. 
  Officials said most of the buyers of this year's paperless 
treasury bonds will be banks and other financial organizations. 
However, other institutions and individuals who want to buy at 
least 10,000 yuan ($1,149) worth of treasury bonds can also 
purchase the bonds through under writers. 
  China began to issue paperless treasury bonds in 1991 on an 
experimental basis. In that year, a total of 1.1 billion yuan 
($126.4 million) treasury bonds were issued. 
  Last year, China issued 3.6 billion yuan ($413.8 million) in 
five-year paperless treasury bonds. 
  Officials from the Ministry of Finance said the issuance of 
paperless treasury bonds represents one of the important 
measures the ministry took this year to reform the issuance of 
treasury bonds. 
  He also said a certain amount in paper treasury bonds will 
be 
issued within the year to meet the demand of individual 
investors. 
  The paper treasury bonds will carry interest rates higher 
than bank deposits of the same term. 
  In other developments, Wei Wenyuan, General Manager of the 
Shanghai Securities Exchange, said the exchange will be built to 
be the country's only paperless trading and clearing centre. 
  He said Shanghai will make special efforts to develop the 
treasury bond market this year to make the exchange not only the 
country's biggest stock market but also the biggest treasury 
bonds market.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Central People's 
Radio Network will carry on Program No. 2 a "lecture on the 
concept and techniques of stock market investing" from 2030 to 
2040 [1230-1240 GMT] every Sunday beginning on 16 January. 
  The lecture is cosponsored by the "Stock Market" program of 
the network's news center, the Beijing Xinlande securities 
investment consulting company, and Japan's Murano securities 
company. There will be 10 lectures with both practical and 
specialized contents, with an emphasis on practical usefulness,

assets formulated by the investment of shareholders and enjoys 
rights and shoulder responsibilities under civil law. 
  Ownership of the state assets of a company belongs to the 
state. 
  Article 5 The company uses all the resources to 
which a legal entity is entitled to conduct management 
independently and shoulders sole responsibility for gains and

<F P=106> [Interview with Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State </F>
Economic and Trade Commission, by unidentified reporters on 12 
January; place not given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- [Reporter] The Fifth 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing 
Committee officially passed the "Company Law of the People's 
Republic of China." In your opinion, what is the practical 
significance of its promulgation and implementation? 
  [Chen] The Company Law just passed is the first company law 
of New China as well as an important law for the establishment 
of a socialist market economy. Its formulation embodies the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee on closely integrating reform policy with legislation 
policy and on using law to guide, expedite, and protect the 
smooth progress of reform. The law was formulated and will be 
implemented for the purpose of providing a legal basis for the 
organization of the new enterprise type. It is significant in 
terms of meeting the needs of establishing a modern enterprise 
system and promoting the development of a socialist market 
economy. 
  [Reporter] What role does the Company Law play in 
establishing a socialist market economy? 
  [Chen] The role played by the promulgation and 
implementation of the Company Law in establishing a socialist 
market economy is mainly manifested in the following four 
aspects: 
  1. It is conducive to standardizing the market's behavior in 
the organization of its principal part, to invigorating 
enterprises, to deepening reform of enterprises, to establishing 
a modern enterprise system, and to enabling a good market order 
to take shape. 
  2. It is conducive to accelerating the pace of transforming 
enterprises' operating mechanisms; to clearly defining property 
rights involved in relationships and improving the legal person 
system of enterprises; to protecting the accumulation and 
circulation of funds; to protecting the legitimate rights and 
interests of companies, shareholders, and creditors; and to 
promoting scientific and democratic decision-making through a 
legal system by enterprises in operation and management, thereby 
enabling them to become truly legal person entities. 
  3. It is conducive to accelerating the nurture and 
improvement of a market system, standardizing transactions on 
the market, and maintaining the order of fair competition, 
thereby giving play to the basic role of the market mechanism in 
the distribution of resources. 
  4. It is helpful for the government to change functions, 
exercise administration according to law, truly separate its 
functions from those of enterprises, and thereby employ legal 
means to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control in a 
better way to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national 
economic development [cu jin guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian 
kang fa zhan 0191 6651 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 
0256 1660 4099 1455] as well as sweeping social progress. 
  [Reporter] How will you properly organize the study and 
propaganda of the Company Law now that it has been promulgated? 
  [Chen] After the Company Law was promulgated and before it 
officially goes into effect on 1 July, first of all, we must 
properly organize its study and propaganda in order that people 
may understand the essence of its guidelines and be familiar 
with its specific articles and regulations. The economic and 
trade commissions at all levels must adopt various forms to 
conduct intensive study and propaganda and, in particular, must 
properly organize its study by the leaders of large and 
medium-sized state enterprises. We must widely publicize basic 
knowledge concerning the Company Law, and treat the task as an 
important element of the "second five-year plan" for the 
economic and trade commissions and their affiliated 
organizations to popularize laws. This is a prerequisite for 
the implementation of the Company Law. 
  [Reporter] How can the Company Law be effectively 
implemented in the course of deepening reform of enterprises and 
in the course of establishing a modern enterprise system? 
  [Chen] The implementation of the Company Law is an arduous 
and complicated task. First of all, it must be conducted in an 
organized way and step by step under the unified leadership of 
the State Council. We must stress practical results in 
reorganizing state enterprises through experiment with selected 
enterprises according to the Company Law. Special attention 
must be paid to successfully handling the relationship between 
the transformation of operating mechanisms and the 
reorganization of an enterprise into a company system. Only 
those state enterprises whose conditions are ripe can be 
gradually reorganized into companies. However, such 
reorganization must be carried out in accordance with certain 
formalities and procedures and in a steady way. Companies 
cannot be established or inflexibly reorganized from those state 
enterprises whose conditions are not ripe. Least of all are 
state enterprises permitted to rush headlong into reorganization 
as if it were a mass activity. Do be careful not to 
misinterpret this good "sutra." In short, if the company 
system, as a scientific form of enterprises' organization, is to 
truly give play to its role, we must insist on standardization 
and on establishing companies or reorganizing enterprises into 
companies according to law. 
  [Reporter] Could you please discuss how to specifically 
implement the Company Law by linking the implementation with the 
duties of the State Economic and Trade Commission? 
  [Chen] As a department under the State Council responsible 
for comprehensive management of the national economy, the State 
Economic and Trade Commission has the responsibility to play its 
due role in the implementation of the Company Law under the 
unified plan of the State Council. The Company Law is the most 
important law standardizing the principal part of the market; 
supportive laws and provisions are still needed to facilitate 
its implementation. With the approval of the State Council, we 
must vigorously work with other relevant departments to 
formulate appropriate, supportive laws and provisions, such as 
those governing the reorganization of state enterprises into 
limited liability companies, limited liability stock companies, 
and wholly state-owned companies, while successfully conducting 
study and propaganda of the Company Law. No matter whether 
state enterprises are selected for reorganization on a trial 
basis or reorganized to implement the Company Law, they must be 
protected by well-considered supportive laws and provisions. 
Successfully implementing the Company Law is a matter of great 
importance that has a bearing on the overall situation of 
reforming enterprises and establishing a socialist market 
economy. We must make vigorous efforts to safely do a good job 
of it. 
  [Reporter] At a national economic and trade work conference 
held not long ago, the State Economic and Trade Commission 
proposed a plan to "either transform the operating mechanisms of 
or establish a modern enterprise system among 10,000 large and 
medium-sized state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100 
different types of large and medium-sized state enterprises, and 
enterprises in 10 cities or prefectures" this year. Does the 
task have anything to do with the implementation of the Company 
Law? 
  [Chen] The above-mentioned plan which we proposed to carry 
out is an important step and a useful tool for deepening reform 
of enterprises and for establishing a modern enterprise system. 
Its main purposes are to facilitate enterprises' participation 
in the market and their transformation into a principal part of 
the competition operating independently, and to further 
accelerate the pace of the transformation of state enterprises' 
operating mechanisms and the adjustment of enterprises' 
organizational structure, thereby laying a sound foundation for 
the establishment of a socialist market economy. The 
implementation of the above plan is closely related to the 
implementation of the Company Law. We must conduct 
reorganization of state enterprises into companies in strict 
accordance with the Company Law and its supportive laws and 
regulations. Meanwhile, we must bring about an organic 
integration between the implementation of the Company Law and 
the continued successful implementation of the "Enterprise Law" 
and the "Regulations" on transforming state enterprises' 
operating mechanisms.

(2621 1696 5281): "Goods Supply: From Scarcity to Abundance"] 
  [Text] The ration coupons and certificates shown here have 
now become collector's items. But for decades before reform and 
opening up, and even in the first few years after reform and 
opening up began, they were in control of the Chinese people's 
daily life all the time. 
  At that time, no matter what you wanted to buy, you had to 
have ration coupons or certificates. Almost everything, be it 
food, clothing, houses, utensils, or transport, had to be 
obtained with "the tickets." Someone once did a survey and 
found that, in the 1970's, every person in Guangzhou typically 
carried as many as 65 commodity ration coupons and certificates. 
  When discussing grain coupons, an old comrade said with 
emotion: In the 1960's and 70's, when you were going on a 
business trip, you first had to take your ration book to the 
grain store to get grain coupons. You had to take grain coupons 
with you when you were away from home to attend a conference or 
to stay in a hotel. Even having a breakfast or snack out 
required grain coupons. But today the situation is really good. 
Not only were bicycle ration coupons, color television ration 
coupons, soap ration coupons, sugar ration coupons, and oil 
ration coupons all scrapped long ago, even grain coupons -- 
which had the largest variety, biggest quantity, and longest 
history among all ration coupons -- have been abolished. 
  Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up, alongside 
the rapid development of China's economy, commodity supply has 
become more and more sufficient. In 1992, the national 
commodity retail volume reached 1.0894 trillion yuan, seven 
times the 1978 figure, representing a net increase of 933.6 
billion yuan. In rural areas as well as in urban areas, shops 
have such a comprehensive array of goods that there is just 
about everything one would expect to find. In 1992, the retail 
volume of consumer goods nationwide reached 961.3 billion yuan. 
  In the 15 years of reform and opening up, the life of the 
Chinese people can be compared to sesame in bloom, with each 
flower growing higher than the last. However, we still have 
quite a long way to go to reach the goal of "moderate 
prosperity," and our country's national income is still rather 
low compared to developed countries. This is especially true 
with peasants, whose per-capita annual income last year was only 
approximately 800 yuan. This requires us to vigorously throw 
ourselves into reform and economic construction, work hard to 
develop production, create more material wealth, and satisfy the 
ever-rising demand of the general public for material and 
cultural life.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 25 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese people 
have become increasingly more consumer-conscious and learned to 
protect their rights by resorting to legal instruments. 
  A case in point involves two young women who won a law suit 
last year for illegal body search by a shopping center which 
suspected them of shop-lifting. 
  According to Cao Xiaoqi, deputy secretary-general of the 
China Consumers Association, with the support of governments at 
all levels, a consumer protection network now covers the whole 
country, embracing about 40,000 organizations. 
  Meanwhile, the country's first consumer law came into force 
at the beginning of this year, which stipulates that a consumer 
may claim for compensation doubling the amount of the goods 
bought if the goods were found to be false or not up to 
standards. 
  Now more and more consumers are learning to fight 
encroachments on their rights, such as short weight, defective 
or shoddy goods, and poor service, Cao said. 
  He said that since the association was established in 1984 
such organizations have spread all over the urban and rural 
areas. 
  In addition, some far-sighted companies have also set up 
their own consumer-protection units so as to earn a good 
reputation. 
  So far, China's industrial and commercial units have set up 
25,000 stations to deal with consumers' feedback on their 
products. 
  Meanwhile, consumers associations closely co-operate with 
the 
news media. As a result, a number of enterprises, which have 
severely damaged consumers' interests while refusing to pay for 
losses, have been exposed to the public. 
  In line with the nationwide campaign to stamp out shoddy and 
false goods, the associations make spot checks on a wide range 
of goods, covering electrical appliances and food, Cao said. 
  During the past nine years the country's consumers 
associations have handled 1.6 million complaints from consumers, 
over 95 percent of which have been settled with nearly 600 
million (about 67 million U.S. dollars) in compensation for 
consumers. Offenders have been fined a total of 40 million yuan 
(about 4.5 million U.S. dollars).

<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Law Urged to Protect the Health of Workers"] </F>
  [Text] Labour Ministry officials are pushing for a draft 
law on occupational disease control in the wake of the many 
serious cases of industrial dust pollution reported recently. 
  They also are urging an education drive to make workers in 
enterprises, especially in foreign-funded and private ones, 
aware of protecting their health, rights and interests through 
current regulations. 
  Last year, more than 10,000 new industrial projects were 
checked on occupational safety and hygiene, according to Lin 
Xiaoning from the Labour Ministry. 
  Those factories which did not pass the examination have been 
ordered to make improvements within a fixed time before going 
into operation. 
  But Lin did not give the exact figure of the factories 
failing to pass the check. 
  He complained that some enterprises and even local 
governments had ignored poisonous dust and other materials that 
brought great harm to workers' health. 
  A report by the local health department shows that at least 
5,000 shoe workers are suffering from benzene poisoning in 
Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. With 4,000 shoe producers, shoe 
making is a major industry in the city. 
  The Beijing-based Health News reported that 72 to 73 per 
cent 
of the workshops in the city's shoemaking industry had benzene 
density in the air beyond allowed limits. 
  A woman worker was killed by the poisonous air at a 
privately- owned shoe heel workshop where four women worked in a 
nine-square metre room. The consistency of benzene in the air 
was found 20 times higher than the State standard. 
  The Beijing-based China Environment News also reported a 
similar situation in the foreign-funded shoemaking industry in 
Hainan Province. 
  It said the provincial government officials have decided 
that 
any projects likely to cause environmental pollution would not 
be introduced into the country's largest special zone any more. 
  The capital city of Beijing is also not exempt from the 
problem. 
  The municipal government has promised to help check 
poisonous 
dust in foreign-funded enterprises. 
  According to Lin Qiu, Deputy Director-General of the Beijing 
Labour Bureau, the health of about 100,000 workers is affected 
by poisonous dust in local enterprises.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Do a Good Job of Easing the Flow </F>
of Laborers Around the Spring Festival"] 
  [Text] With the Spring Festival approaching, the 
population flow in China this year is about to reach its peak. 
Among those travelling, laborers seeking jobs outside their 
provinces are a large proportion. As predicted by pertinent 
departments, the total number of laborers flowing from region to 
region during the Spring Festival this year will exceed 10 
million. For this reason, persons in charge of various 
localities and departments should make appropriate preparations 
and concerted efforts to straighten out the flow of laborers 
around the Spring Festival. 
  Over the past few years, along with the urban and rural 
economic development, the shift of rural surplus labors to 
nonagricultural sectors has gathered pace, and laborers seeking 
jobs outside their regions have repeatedly increased. This has 
become a phenomenon in China's economic life, which merits 
people's attention. Thanks to the growth of agricultural 
productive forces and the markets of production factors, the 
emergence of such a phenomenon in China's economic life during 
the transition period from an agricultural to an industrial 
country, and from a backward to a modernized economy is, to a 
certain extent, inevitable. On the one hand, it has accelerated 
the mutually promotive and beneficial economic relationships 
among various regions, which is conducive to the improvement of 
peasants' lives and the enhancement of economic level as a 
whole, but on the other hand it has brought forth problems 
having an adverse impact on production, living order, social 
stability, and so on, owing to the blind flow on a large scale. 
In this regard, governments and functional departments at all 
levels should fully exercise their role of macroscopic 
regulation and control and play a positive part in actively 
cultivating and fostering labor markets, providing services to 
the rural population, and straightening out the flow of laborers 
with a view to bringing about the development, utilization, and 
rational distribution of rural labor resources, boosting 
economic construction, and maintaining good social order. 
  The work to direct the flow of laborers during the Spring 
Festival is difficult to tackle and demands high techniques for 
its numerous links and concentrated tasks to be fulfilled in a 
short period of time. On the basis of summing up past 
experience, various localities and departments should study and 
work out measures and emergency plans to direct the flow by 
conscientiously intensifying leadership and meticulously 
organizing the masses to ensure that all measures are carried 
out in good time. In light of the quantity and direction of the 
flow, the railway and communication departments should draw up 
plans in advance and make proper arrangements for 
transportation. In the arrangements of tickets, runs, flights, 
and so on, efforts should be made to convenience the returning 
laborers, and the communication system should undergo strict 
technical and standardized examination to really ensure 
passengers' safety. Departments in charge of labor power in 
various localities should seriously perform their duties of 
organization, management, coordination, and others so as to keep 
abreast of the condition of the flow. Public security 
departments should properly organize the police force to 
maintain order in stations and ports as well as on traffic 
lines, and severely crack down on road robbers and other 
criminal activities so as to strengthen the sense of safety 
among the masses. 
  The work to direct the flow of laborers is an important 
policy issue. In treating the masses, first of all, it is 
necessary to provide good services to them, pay attention to the 
work method in handling the matter, take an amicable and cordial 
attitude toward them, and refrain from being harsh and 
impetuous, lest it should sharpen the contradiction. 
Departments in charge of labor power and civil affairs should 
coordinate with other departments in patiently persuading and 
helping the transients to return home as early as possible. 
Propaganda departments should vigorously publicize the 
necessity of rational transference and orderly flow of rural 
surplus labor, disseminate the good experience in transference 
to work in local or nearby regions and organized exports of 
labor, and make peasants realize the drawbacks of seeking jobs 
in other regions. It is necessary to correctly explain and 
implement the party's policies so as to prevent peasants from 
misunderstanding these policies. In light of the seasonal and 
periodic characteristics and law governing the flow of rural 
laborers, leading cadres in various localities should pay close 
attention to carrying out the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and, while studying 
the issue of agricultural development, study and formulate 
policies and measures to facilitate the employment and 
utilization of rural laborers and boost labor markets, so as to 
take the initiative in settling the problem at an early date and 
in an effective way. 
  The work to direct the flow of laborers around the Spring 
Festival is a major event that has a bearing on the immediate 
interests of and the social stability for millions upon millions 
of peasants. All localities and departments should fully 
realize its importance and take the work as a specific content 
of transforming government functions, changing work style, and 
doing practical things for the people. Hence, efforts should be 
made to do the work appropriately so that the vast numbers of 
people in cities and villages can spend a joyful and auspicious 
Spring Festival, thus making a good start for the work in the 
coming year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chaowen (1728 6389 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an informal 
meeting with persons in charge of provincial coal 
administrations and major mining bureaus in the country 
yesterday evening, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua urged them that, 
after the nation has decontroled coal prices, they should strive 
to adapt themselves to the new situation and push the nation's 
coal industry to operate according to market needs. 
  Zou Jiahua began his speech by relaying the cordial regards 
of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to the 
country's coal workers who have contributed significantly to the 
national economic development. After hearing reports of the 
Datong Mining Bureau, the Jixi Mining Bureau, the Chongqing Coal 
Company, and the Capital Coal Construction Company, Zou Jiahua 
said that, after coal prices have been decontroled, the 
country's coal industry will confront a new situation where 
production decisions have to be made according to market supply 
and demand. In view of this the nation's coal industry must come 
up with new measures adaptable to the new situation. He said: 
After several decades, Chinese coal enterprises have become 
used to the planned economic management, and the traditions that 
the state was responsible for drawing up production plans, 
supplying equipment, alloting production capital, and buying up 
products are deep rooted. Under the market economic system, 
coal enterprises not only must study how much coal they should 
produce, but also how much they can sell; and not only must they 
study the domestic market, they must also study the world 
market. The decontroling of coal prices does not mean that coal 
enterprises can set prices themselves. It means market prices 
must be determined by buyers and sellers according to market 
needs. From now on the state will draw up coal production plans 
according to market needs. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out: After they enter the market, coal 
enterprises must lower their production cost and increase their 
productivity, otherwise they cannot possibly compete there. 
Overstaffing has been one longstanding problem plaguing China's 
coal industry. Coal miners from now on must foster their 
militancy and hardworking spirit and make great efforts to 
diversify operations. 
  Zou Jiahua concluded by saying that coal mines must 
intensify 
their production safety after entering the market. He said: 
Leaders of coal enterprises in the country not only must pay 
attention to returns, but also safety, which is even more 
important. Efforts must be made so that, under the new situation 
marked by market economy, the production will be safer each year 
and the mortality rate of coal miners will continue to drop for 
the output of 1 million tonnes of coal.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- China today reported 
the outbreak of more than 38,000 fires in 1993, in which 2,467 
people were killed and 5,977 injured. 
  According to Liu Shipu, director of the Fire-Control Bureau 
of the Ministry of Public Security, direct losses of the fires 
in 1993 amounted to 1.12 billion yuan, the heaviest since the 
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. 
  Liu attributed the frequent outbreaks of the fires to the 
increase of sub-standard construction projects and of 
enterprises dealing with combustibles, management chaos in the 
fire prevention sector in some departments, poor quality of 
certain employees, as well as insufficient fire-fighting 
equipment. 
  He said another major factor was that some enterprises and 
localities raced for economic profits, at the expense of fire- 
prevention. 
  A breakdown of the fire figures shows that 57 percent of the 
206 large-scale fires broke out in the booming coastal areas and 
10 percent in foreign-funded ventures. 
  Liu called on governments at all levels to implement 
strictly 
the laws and regulations regarding fire-prevention. 
  He also urged that more funds should be put into the 
revamping of fire-control equipment and infrastructure. 
  In 1993, 36 Chinese fire-fighters lost their lives and more 
than 2,000 were injured on duty.

"Progress Made in Reforming and Developing the Rural Financial 
System; Rural Residents' Savings Exceed 600 Billion Yuan"] 
  [Text] The reform and development of the rural financial 
system took another step forward in 1993. Up to the end of last 
year, the savings of the Agricultural Bank of China and credit 
cooperatives had already reached 827.9 billion yuan, 157.2 
billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. The 
balance of various loans was 968 billion yuan, 176 billion yuan 
more than at the beginning of the year. 
  Last year, the Agricultural Bank of China at all levels, 
proceeding from the overall situation, exercised strict control 
over the total volume of credit, comprehensively implemented 
relevant rules, and collected 5.8 billion yuan of funds lent in 
violation of the rules. Under circumstances in which savings 
slid and banks had difficulties with funds, the Agricultural 
Bank of China and credit cooperatives at all levels always put 
the organization of funds in the most important position and 
rural savings reached 610.2 billion yuan by the end of the year, 
126.3 billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. This 
has laid a firm foundation in terms of funds for providing 
support to agriculture in the future. The Agricultural Bank of 
China, taking ensuring payment as the prerequisite, gave 
priority to meeting the need for funds for agricultural 
development and to the purchase of agricultural and sideline 
products and focused its support on developing "high output, 
high efficiency, and high quality" agriculture, invigorating 
agriculture with science and technology, and helping the poor 
and providing relief to victims of natural disasters. In 1993, 
the Agricultural Bank of China and the credit cooperatives 
granted agricultural loans totaling 232.9 billion yuan, 30 
billion yuan more than the previous year. To give support to 
the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and to ensure 
purchasing enterprises would not give IOU's to peasants, in 1993 
the bank and the credit cooperatives granted loans for the 
purchase of agricultural and sideline products totaling 243 
billion yuan, 1.3 billion yuan more than the previous year, thus 
ensuring the smooth progress of the purchase of agricultural and 
sideline products throughout the year.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--Russia's domestic political 
upheavals will not affect the priority it attaches to ties with 
China, visiting Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here 
Thursday. 
  Kozyrev, who arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit, told 
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that the strengthening of 
bilateral relations would remain a "top priority" and that he 
hoped Chinese President Jiang Zemin could visit Moscow for a 
summit later this year. 
  The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of 
"sincere and cordial" talks on bilateral and international 
issues, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, adding that 
one hour of the talks was held in private. 
  No details were given of their closed-door session. 
  Relations between the two neighbours would not suffer as the 
result of "political changes in Russia's domestic situation," 
Kozyrev was quoted as saying. 
  According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts 
over the past year, including the visit here by President Boris 
Yeltsin in December, had lent "great impetus" to the development 
of Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links. 
  Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7 
billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5 
billion dollars. 
  Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement 
for regular consultations on the establishment of "transit 
ports" along their 4,500-kilometre (2,800-mile) common border. 
About 20 such ports are currently in operation. 
  The spokesman did not say if the two foreign ministers had 
discussed the possibilty of visa restrictions to stem the flood 
of people crossing the border daily. 
  Some 2.5 million people crossed the border in 1993 and 
Kozyrev admitted before leaving Moscow that the number of 
Chinese in Russia had become "a very serious problem." 
  Kozyrev was quoted as telling Qian that Moscow's military 
policy was strictly "defensive" and he reiterated Russia's 
commitment to a bilateral agreement pledging non-use of nuclear 
weapons against each other. 
  After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning 
of 
the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in 
1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since 
Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 following the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing have enjoyed 
close military cooperation. 
  While the two foreign ministers discussed cooperation in 
various areas, the spokesman said they had not specifically 
touched on military issues. 
  Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to 
participate in several large-scale construction projects in 
China, including the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric dam 
being built on the Yangtze River. 
  Qian said he would welcome Russian cooperation, the 
spokesman 
said. 
  Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Jiang on Friday before 
leaving for a tour of the southern Chinese special economic zone 
of Shenzhen.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- China on Thursday 
denied reports of North Korean President Kim Il-song's planned 
visit to China, saying there is no preparation to meet President 
Kim. 
  At a weekly press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Wu Jianmin said, "At the moment, I can say that there 
is no preparation (to meet Kim Il-song)." 
  Early this month some South Korean press reports said that 
Kim Il-song would visit China to observe economic reforms and 
that North Korean Party Secretary Hwang Chang-yop's recent visit 
to Beijing was to prepare for Kim's visit. 
  Spokesman Wu said Hwang's visit was a scheduled tour and had 
nothing to do with any visit by Kim Il-song. "Kim's visit was 
not among the matters discussed between Hwang and Chinese 
officials," Wu said. 
  He also voiced China's objection to the reported plan to 
deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles in South Korea. "We do not 
approve a conduct that undermines stability and peace on the 
Korean peninsula," he said. 
  Wu further demanded the retraction of the U.S. plan to 
create "Radio Free Asia," calling it an act of interference in 
other's internal affairs. 
  "The true purpose of the radio is to interfere in the 
internal affairs of and set off confusion in China and other 
Asian countries," Spokesman Wu said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said today that China does not approve of any 
actions detrimental to peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The spokesman made the remark at a weekly press conference 
here this afternoon when asked to comment on a report that the 
U.S. is planning to deploy "Patriot" missiles in the Republic of 
Korea (ROK). 
  The maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula is in the fundamental interests of the Korean nation,

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese side 
has seriously and conscientiously investigated the matter of a 
Chinese company selling contraband chemicals to a U.S. company, 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today. 
  When asked to confirm and comment that a Chinese company has 
sold contraband chemicals to the Middle East at the weekly news 
briefing, Wu said the initial result of investigations shows 
that at repeated requests by a U.S. company, the Chinese 
company, in violation of the relevant provisions of the Chinese 
Government, sold a certain amount of some kind of chemicals to 
it. 
  The Chinese side has informed the U.S. Government of the 
investigation results and demanded that the U.S. Government 
conduct necessary investigations of the U.S. company, he said. 
  According to what has been said by the U.S. side, Wu said, 
the U.S. Government is investigating the American company. 
  Therefore, said the spokesman, the question as to which 
place 
the U.S. company finally sold these goods should be referred to 
the U.S. side.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
should withdraw its plan to set up "Radio Free Asia", a Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remark at a weekly press 
conference held here this afternoon when asked to comment on the 
"Radio Free Asia" bill passed by the U.S. Senate. 
  "The real motive behind the setting up of this radio is to 
interfere in the internal affairs of China and other Asian 
countries and create confusion through news media," Wu said. 
  Wu stressed that the affairs of Asian countries should be 
handled by their own people. 
  When the setting up of this radio station was under 
consideration, he noted, China and many other Asian countries 
voiced their strong opposition to it. 
  By taking the action, Wu said, the United States has 
trampled 
upon the universally acknowledged norms governing international 
relations and violated the basic principles laid down in the 
three joint communiques between China and the United States.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin reiterated this afternoon 
in a reference to the problem of Hong Kong that China is willing 
to cooperate with Britain, saying that the door of negotiations 
remains open and hoping that Britain changes its course and 
withdraws the part of the political reform package that has been 
tabled to the Legislative Council. 
  On the Hong Kong airport problem, Wu Jianmin said in reply 
to 
a reporter's question that on the one hand, Britain stated its 
willingness to call the next Airport Committee meeting with 
China, and on the other hand it unilaterally made appropriations 
to airport-related projects without an agreement on the 
financial arrangements for the new airport in an attempt to 
achieve a fait accompli, showing that it is not sincere about 
reopening the New Airport Committee meeting. 
  Wu Jianmin said that countries all around the world are 
actively developing relations, especially trade and economic 
ties, with China, which has become an established trend. The 
noncooperative attitude adopted by Britain on the problem of 
Hong Kong seems a little out of fashion. 
  At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' routine weekly press 
conference, Wu Jianmin also said in reply to a reporter's 
question that in their talks this morning, Chinese and Russian 
foreign ministers did not discuss specifically military 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [By Gilles Campion] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--China and France marked the 
30th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties Thursday with an 
acknowledgement of recent difficulties in the relationship and a 
promise to improve it. 
  A simple ceremony at the French embassy here recalled the 
January 27, 1964 decision of president Charles de Gaulle to 
exchange ambassadors with Mao Zedong's government, making France 
the first major Western power to establish full diplomatic 
relations with communist China. 
  A French delegation consisting of various dignitaries 
including de Gaulle's son, Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, was on 
hand. 
  The ceremony came ahead of an official visit here by French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur expected within the next few 
months. 
  The visit is planned to give impetus to the reconciliation 
between the two countries agreed to in a January 12 communique 
which ended a year-long freeze in the relationship. 
  At the embassy, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei 
admitted to "vicissitudes" in Franco-Sino ties, a reference to 
Beijing's closing of the French consulate in Guangzhou after 
France's late 1992 sale of 60 jet fighters to Taiwan. 
  The normalisation of ties -- making French firms eligible to 
compete again for major contracts in China's booming econmy -- 
required Paris to agree in the communique to make no further 
arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade 
province of the mainland. 
  With the communique, Tian said, France and China had decided 
to "open a new page and a new phase of development" in their 
relationship. 
  Tian said he was "convinced that relations between the two 
countries were going to develop even more in all domains." 
  The head of the French delegation, MP Alain Peyrefitte, said 
"the clouds that had accumulated in recent years have now 
dissipated. 
  Peyrefitte, who was a Gaullist minister 30 years ago, agreed 
with Tian that the decision taken by de Gaulle and Mao had been 
"historic," and unveiled a plaque to commemorate it. 
  Later Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's official 
spokesman echoed the hope that China and France would enjoy a 
closer relationship in future, while subtly putting Paris on 
notice that Beijing expects it to stick to its commitment to 
refrain from any future arms sales to cash-rich Taiwan. 
  "We are convinced that so long as the two sides strictly 
abide by the principles for the establishment of diplomatic 
relations and other relevant principles enshrined in the joint 
communique, bilateral relations are very promising," spokesman 
Wu Jianmin told reporters. 
  The French delegation, which also includes French officials 
with a special interest in China and a former French ambassador 
here, was scheduled to meet Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen on Thursday evening.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said this afternoon that 
as Sino-French political relations improve, bilateral economic 
cooperation and trade will improve and develop correspondingly. 
It is believed that so long as both sides observe strictly the 
principles on which the two countries established diplomatic 
ties and the relevant principles in the joint communique, the 
prospects for the development of Sino-French relations will be 
very good. 
  At the ministry press conference, Wu Jianmin said in a 
comment on the current status and prospects of Sino-French 
relations: Today is the 30th anniversary of the establishment 
of Sino-French diplomatic ties. It was a historic decision made 
Mao Zedong and General De Gaulle. For most of the last 30 
years, the two countries achieved highly fruitful cooperation in 
various areas, though Sino-French relations did suffer serious 
setbacks. The two governments, after consultations, issued a 
joint communique, which opened a new page in bilateral ties. 
  Wu Jianmin told reporters that Philippe de Gaulle, son of 
General de Gaulle, was among the persons who visited China with 
French envoy Peyrefitte.

  [Text] Seoul, January 26 (XINHUA) -- South Korea [ROK] and 
the United States are "positively" considering deployment of 
Patriot missiles at bases of the American forces in Korea, South 
Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said here Wednesday 
[26 January]. 
  "Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong 
said, "as to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be 
made after further consultations." 
  "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will 
enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability," he said. 
  South Korea will not purchase Patriot missiles and the anti- 
missile defense system will be part of the weaponry deployed by 
the U.S. forces in Korea at their bases, Hong added. 
  At present, about 36,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in 
South 
Korea.

  [Text] Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today rebuked French Foreign Minister Alan Juppe's suggestion 
that Washington press the Bosnian Muslims to accept a peace 
settlement with the Serbs and Croats. 
  "In a sense, forcing a settlement on that aggrieved party 
(the Bosnian Muslims) requires a very strange moral calculus," 
said Mike McCurry, U.S. State Department spokesman. 
  This was in response to Juppe's comments to the NEW YORK 
TIMES late Monday that if Washington did not exert pressure on 
the Muslims, it would be a catastrophe and the U.S. would be 
responsible. 
  This latest exchange of recriminations marks a rising rift 
between Washington and Paris on ending the two-year-long ethnic 
fighting in the former Yugoslavia. 
  During a recent visit to Paris, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher brushed away suggestions for the imposition 
of a peace settlement in Bosnia, saying Washington was unwilling 
to commit the large number of troops required. 
  Forcing peace on unwilling parties "just doesn't logically 
make much sense to the United States at this point," McCurry 
said. 
  As the Balkan fighting drags on, the West is apparently 
losing patience, as France, Canada, and Britain threatening to 
pull out their troops stationed in Bosnia under the UN flag. 
  There are no U.S. ground troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
situation often criticized by the nations with forces deployed 
there. 
  On a related matter, McCurry said it was "very doubtful" 
that 
a meeting of UN Security Council foreign ministers, as suggested 
by Russia, would "have any greater success" than the European 
Union's recent failed efforts.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Academy 
of Sciences (CAS), the country's most authoritative scholarly 
body, will for the first time take in foreign scientists in May 
this year, a CAS spokesman said here today. 
  The foreign scientists will be elected as CAS academicians 
at 
the seventh academicians' conference of the CAS in May, he said. 
  The move is aimed at speeding up academic exchanges with 
foreign countries and international co-operation, the spokesman 
said. 
  With the status of Chinese scientists rising, more than 200 
CAS scientists hold posts in important world academic bodies, he 
added. 
  Other academic co-operation includes 64 academic agreements 
the CAS has signed with scientific academies in other countries, 
the spokesman told a current annual work conference of the CAS, 
which started Tuesday. 
  CAS President Zhou Guangzhao also spoke at the conference. 
He said that CAS scientists are carrying on substantial 
co-operation with their foreign colleagues, which includes a 
Sino-U.S. high-energy physics project. 
  The CAS has acquired a large amount of international funds 
for research into deserts, mineral resources, geochemistry and 
global changes, he said. 
  The president called on the CAS academicians to conduct more 
"substantive" co-operation with foreign colleagues, through 
which transnational labs and research centers could be 
established.

<F P=106> ["International Jottings" by Mu Ni (4476 1441): "The </F>
Phantom Refuses to Leave"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of the New Year, Sudan President 
al-Bashir announced the deportation of the British ambassador on 
National Day, celebrating the 38th anniversary of shaking off 
the British colonial rule. This has taught "a lesson" to the 
British Government, which interfered in its internal affairs. 
  The deportation of the ambassador of a foreign country is 
not 
a minor matter on which the decision can be easily made in 
diplomatic affairs. The Sudanese Government showed the British 
ambassador the door only after it had conclusive evidence 
proving he had "interfered in something which had nothing to do 
with him." The British Foreign Ministry afterward asked the 
Sudanese Government to reconsider the decision and has now 
announced the deporting of the Sudanese ambassador from London. 
However, this unreasonable move cannot change the fact that 
Britain has interfered in the internal affairs of another 
country and it only shows the phantom of the former British 
Empire refuses to leave. 
  Here, we might as well look back at an event which occurred 
over 100 years ago. If the British Government is not forgetful, 
it should remember better than others how Gordon died in the 
Sudan. As a colonial governor, Gordon was insufferably arrogant 
and acted like a tyrant. He was, of course, more imposing than 
the present British ambassador to Sudan. However, when the 
Sudan national hero Mahdi started an uprising, the vigorous and 
heroic struggle against the British colonial rule immediately 
swept across Sudan and the people captured Khartoum. The 
feeling of the fighters in the uprising was high and they 
pierced Gordon's body with a sharp spear. This butcher, whose 
hands had once been stained with the blood of the Chinese 
people, finally died on the staircase of the British governor's 
residence. This was a punishment meted out by history for the 
colonialist. 
  What is surprising is that today, when the world has 
developed to the end of the 20th century and every shred of the 
"prestige" of the British Empire has been swept away, some 
people in the British Government are still following the example 
of their ancestors and are engaged in activities which interfere 
in the internal affairs of other countries. They really show no 
understanding of the times.

<F P=106> ["Political talk" column article by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 </F>
3768): "Clinton Seeks Support of Middle-of-the-Roaders for His 
Reform"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Threatens to Veto Laws Passed by Congress </H5>
  Yesterday, U.S. President Bill Clinton delivered his first 
"State of the Union Address" since taking office. In his 
hour-long speech he mainly talked about domestic problems, 
stressing health and security, the two key points. 
  President Jefferson, who was the pioneer in U.S.-style 
democratic politics, once abolished the practice of personally 
going to Congress to deliver an address; he held that it was a 
kind of "British habit," which was reminiscent of the way in 
which the British monarch speaks to the parliament at the 
beginning of every legislative year. In 1913, President Wilson 
restored the practice of going to Congress to deliver the 
address, hoping that by making an open speech he could win the 
support of the public to overcome obstruction from Congress. 
  Clinton's speech yesterday also put Congress in the position 
of an imaginary enemy, while he himself emerged as a reformist, 
who described Congress as a force obstructing reform. He pulled 
out a pen, which he waved as he said that if the law adopted by 
Congress could not guarantee a health program enjoyed by the 
whole people, he could use the pen to sign a veto order. 
<H5>  Taking Tough Measures To Fight Crimes </H5>
  At the same time when Clinton raised the reformist banner, 
he 
also tried to avoid an excessively radical image. U.S. 
political analysts commented that in his "State of the Union 
Address," Clinton shifted attention to programs of the 
middle-of-the-roaders and abandoned the left wing of the 
Democrats to win the support of the middle class and even set 
foot in areas traditionally guarded by the Republicans. For 
example, the problem of law and order is one which has always 
been emphasized by the Republicans. Clinton used a lot of time 
in his address to claim that he would take tough measures to 
fight crime, in contrast to the Democrats' constant advocacy 
that criminals must be treated leniently. He even borrowed 
jargon from baseball and said one "must be out after three 
strikes," meaning that persons who have committed serious crimes 
three times must be sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  He demanded, on the one hand, a reform of the health and 
medical insurance system, so that it can benefit more the 37 
million people who are currently not covered, and on the other 
hand, he thought that it is necessary to encourage work and 
employment, and that there should not be too much welfare; he 
suggested that the time for claiming unemployment assistance 
should not be more than two years, while retraining must be 
given as a backup. All these are quite able to meet the values 
of the middle class. 
<H5>  Reform Launched Simultaneously on Two Fronts </H5>
  In his "State of the Union Address," Clinton linked welfare 
reform to health and medical reform, and this drew attention. 
Before this, Clinton's draft on health reform was a 1,300-page 
document, which involved a great many complicated arrangements, 
and was strongly criticized by the Republicans and would 
probably run into strong resistance in Congress. Some political 
analysts thought that in order to win support for his draft of 
health reform from a majority of congressmen, Clinton might 
succumb to the pressure of congressmen in other areas, or even 
China's most-favored-nation trading status would become a 
trading condition in congressional politics. Now that Clinton 
has added the welfare reform plan to his address, it would be 
more difficult for the plan to pass in Congress. 
  There are also some people who hold that this is a kind of 
strategy offered by the strategists in the White House, with the 
purpose of deliberately allowing the health and welfare reform 
plans to run into hindrance by Congress, so that they cannot be 
adopted this summer, thus, in November when mid-term elections 
are held, the Democrats would be able to push responsibility 
onto the Republicans, and accuse them of ignoring public 
interests, and by so doing they can win votes. Thus, the 
problem may not have to be settled before June.

  [Text] Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
Administration is looking for an extension of more flexible 
authority from congress in negotiating future trade accords, a 
top government official said here today. 
  Such authority would forbid congressional amendments when 
considering agreement ratification. The White House was given 
this authority during the global trade talks which concluded 
last month. 
  Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, hinted today that 
the administration would seek the same authority when, for 
example, considering an expansion of the North America Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  "It is critical for negotiators for the U.S. to have fast 
track authority if we're going to reach the kind of agreements 
that congress has to ratify," Kantor said. 
  Some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 
Chile and Argentina, are making efforts to join NAFTA, now the 
world's largest free trade zone in terms of territory, 
comprising the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 
  Speaking at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee, 
Kantor said the administration might also seek such authority 
when negotiating bilateral investment and intellectual property 
rights treaties.

  [Text] On 24 January, U.S. President Clinton nominated U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry to replace current 
Secretary of Defense Aspen, who abruptly tendered a letter of 
resignation for reasons of poor health last 15 December. 
  The day after Aspen resigned, Clinton nominated Bobby Inman. 
When Clinton nominated him, some U.S. Congressmen and the public 
opinion stated that Inman was fully qualified for the Pentagon 
post. 
  However, in a letter to Clinton, Inman asked Clinton to 
withdraw the nomination because he did not want he and his 
family to be subjected to personal attacks. 
  According to [word indistinct], Inman voluntarily gave up 
the 
nomination because he is involved in a company that resells 
military equipment illegally. 
  When announcing Perry's nomination, Clinton said Perry 
taught 
at school, [words indistinct], and had a lot of experience in 
the military. He also said Perry had leadership and was honest 
and well versed in current affairs. 
  Perry, 66, was born in Pennsylvania. He studied at Stanford 
University and received a bachelor's and a master's degree in 
mathematics from this university. He later received a doctorate 
in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania. 
  For the one year he worked as U.S. deputy secretary of 
defense, he silently oversaw the Pentagon's daily affairs and 
demonstrated his talent in management and technological affairs. 
  It is said that Perry very rarely appears at public meetings 
and strongly insists that the U.S. capabilities to build 
military materiel be maintained. He also insists on arming the 
military with high-technology weapons. He became famous when he 
supported the (?deployment) of Stealth bombers, cruise missiles, 
and precision guided (?missiles), which played an important role 
in the Gulf war. 
  When Clinton announced the nomination, Perry said he 
accepted 
the President's nomination at a time of great changes and 
challenges. 
  The decades-long Cold War ended because of the Soviet 
Union's 
disintegration. This has not brought security and peace to the 
world but opened a post-Cold War phase that is more complicated 
and very difficult to handle. 
  Aspen reluctantly (?resigned) because he could not do 
anything about a civil war in Somalia and the conflicts in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  When Perry was nominated, the Pentagon and military experts 
assessed him favorably, saying that his nomination would easily 
lead to an actual appointment. Perry must win the confirmation 
by the U.S. Senate before being formally appointed as secretary 
of defense. 
  The post of secretary of defense is an important job that 
many people compete to grab in the United States. Therefore, 
one must wait and see whether Perry will be able to smoothly 
pass the confirmation process.

<F P=106> [By staff correspondent Liu Liping (0491 4539 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 24 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Early in 
the year, THE NEW YORK TIMES chose to interview J. Stapleton 
Roy, U.S. ambassador to the PRC, on the China issue, sparking 
off media interest in keeping track of the White House's actions 
on ending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status five months 
from now. 
  Stapleton told THE NEW YORK TIMES that the last 15 years of 
reform had been the best period China had ever had in the 150 
years since the Opium Wars. Deng Xiaoping's reforms have made 
notable progress in China's march toward a society of greater 
freedom and democracy, noting that the United States should take 
China's economic and social reforms into account when 
approaching the China problem. 
  The basic theme of U.S. China policy can be very largely 
seen 
from the role played by China's economic reforms in the MFN 
issue -- the touchstone for Sino-U.S. relations. Sources close 
to the U.S. Government say that the White House is feeling 
pressure on this issue from China's enormous economic reforms. 
  Experts explained that the pressure from China's economy 
comes in fact from demands within the American economy. A 
foreign policy report by Secretary of State Christopher toward 
the end of last year already hinted that the Clinton 
administration was making economic growth a top priority in its 
foreign policy. At a session of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Christopher described economic security as the top 
factor in U.S. foreign policy, explaining: "National security 
after the Cold War will depend on a powerful economy which will 
function much the same as a powerful military force." Moreover, 
he stated: "For American businessmen, there is no place as 
dynamic as the Asia-Pacific region in terms of economic growth 
and export trade opportunities. The region has an intimate 
interest for U.S. commerce and employment. 
  The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that the volume of 
U.S.-China trade in 1993 topped $35 billion. Wang Tianming, a 
ministerial-rank attache at the PRC Embassy in the United 
States, revealed that in the next seven months, China would 
import 210 key technological projects involving 23 industries. 
Reports from Beijing say imports over the next seven years will 
amount to $700 billion. A commentary by Representative Glickman 
in THE WASHINGTON TIMES represents, to a different extent, the 
current outlook of the U.S. business sector on China. The 
commentary states that future U.S. political and economic 
interests are closely linked to the countries of the Pacific 
rim. China wields a significant influence in the Asia-Pacific 
region. The Chinese market has enormous potential. If the 
United States falls out with China, it will not able to benefit 
from the opportunities the Chinese market offers to the world. 
  Messages from the U.S. State Department over the last few 
days following the THE NEW YORK TIMES interview with the U.S. 
ambassador to China have left the media pondering. In a comment 
on Roy's statement, a State Department spokesman said that while 
economic liberalization had raised people's living standards, 
President Clinton's premise for renewing China's MFN status 
carried specific criteria and definitions. China had made 
progress in some areas, but whether it meets human rights 
requirements depends on the next few months. In an interview 
with ABC, Secretary of State Christopher said: "From our 
standpoint, China's praiseworthy economic achievements cannot 
offset the lack of progress in human rights." He stated that 
the position of both the president and himself was that the 
United States will not forget to take into account China's 
record in human rights due to its excellent economy. 
  Analysts here believe that Christopher's statement 
represents 
the U.S. Government's current policies and position, though they 
also reflect the State Department's attempt to deflect attacks 
from congressmen in support of human rights policy. Analysts 
said that on the MFN issue, the White House faces pressure from 
economic considerations and human rights groups in the Congress. 
  The MFN issue will put the White House in a dilemma shortly 
after New Year. U.S. Vice President Al Gore has said in media 
interviews that the United States still seeks common ground and 
a point of balance between its demands on China to improve its 
right record and bilateral ties. Against this balance seeking 
background, THE WASHINGTON TIMES revealed the view of U.S. 
Government officials on Roy's statement: "Mr. Roy's comments 
have weakened the administration's position on convincing 
Beijing that Washington's strong position on the MFN issue is 
not an empty effort." 
  The views of some U.S. Government officials differ from the 
official position and media commentaries on the MFN issue have 
heated up in the last few months. THE NEW YORK TIMES says: 
Robert Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council, Bowman 
Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy, 
and high-ranking advisers stated that applying sanctions to 
China would harm the United States more than China. The report 
also cited a high- ranking government official saying: We 
cannot continue to distance, and then patch up with China over 
and over again on the MFN issue. There are many more complicated 
affairs to take care of than the MFN issue. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST said in a commentary that the trouble 
with the U.S. Government is that when, for reasons of 
international security and economic factors it cannot strike at 
China with trade sanctions and human rights, President Clinton 
chose human rights as the decisive factor in considering the 
problem. The article further says that, if as the 
administration says, China has not made significant progress in 
human rights, the administration will then be in a position of 
having to sever economic ties with China, which will also dash 
China's wish to cooperate with the United States on the DPRK 
nuclear crisis. The report cited (Jeffrey Gordon), deputy 
secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce, as saying: We do 
want to see substantial progress in human rights, but putting 
the MFN issue at the center of the argument between us and China 
every year is unhealthy for both sides. 
  Haig, former U.S. secretary of state, said in an interview 
with the media that it was a failure to have introduced the MFN 
issue, an economic problem, into the world of policy. In 
dealing with important countries, the United States should not 
take human rights as a central issue between them. James 
Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador to the PRC, said at a seminar 
at Princeton University that economic cooperation was not what 
propelled the United States to establish diplomatic ties with 
China in the first place. However, economic factors account for 
80 percent of U.S.-China relations today, and the United States 
should stop using MFN status as a means to improve human rights 
in China. 
  There are still several months before China's MFN status is 
ended by the White House, and consultations and debates between 
the White House and Congress, between Washington and Beijing, 
and within the Clinton administration have been "warming up." 
Sources here say that in the next few months, China's MFN 
status will not be a topic of light conversation in the White 
House.

  [Text] Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
Administration is ready to assert its right in using section 301 
trade law for unilateral trade sanctions, a top U.S. trade 
official said here today. 
  The conclusion of the world trade talks last month has made 
section 301 "a more effective tool", U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor told a hearing of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. 
  The section 301 trade law, effective since 1974, is the 
legal 
basis for Washington's unilateral trade actions, such as 
sanctions against foreign countries which it says engage in 
unfair trade practices. 
  Sanctions usually go into effect in one year, during which 
investigations are conducted to prove if the unfair trade 
practices are true or not. 
  Kantor denied that the final agreement of the Uruguay round 
of the global trade talks sponsored by the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had adversely impacted U.S. trade 
sovereignty. 
  "As far as dispute settlement is concerned," Kantor said, 
"we 
believe (section 301) is even more effective, and helps our 
sovereignty and makes us stronger, not weaker." 
  "We can assert our rights effectively and on multilateral 
context, and make (section) 301 even a more effective tool," he 
stressed. 
  The trade representative argued that except for the changes 
in the time length of investigation against the alleged unfair 
trade practices, section 301 was virtually left unaffected by 
the Uruguay agreement. 
  Under GATT, the U.S. is required to go to the GATT before it 
enacts section 301 trade law and unilaterally imposes trade 
sanctions against a GATT-covered trade item and a GATT member. 
  Almost all of the areas not covered by GATT are still not 
covered by the world trade organization, which is to replace 
GATT, U.S. officials said. 
  Kantor, meanwhile, cited anti-competitive behavior and 
violation of bilateral trade agreement as possible reasons for 
Washington to use section 301 trade law. 
  "We have a better dispute settlement mechanism to go to in 
the new world trade organization to enforce it in those 
circumstances where we would have to go to GATT," Kantor said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "China and U.S. Join To Fight </F>
Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] China and the United States have agreed to 
strengthen their co-operation in the fight against drug 
trafficking and illegal immigration, said officials of the 
Ministry of Public Security. 
  The two sides reached the consensus on Tuesday during talks 
between Bai Jingfu, Vice-Director of the National Narcotics 
Control Committee and Robert Gelbard, the U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State for international narcotics matters. 
  Bai and Gelbard exchanged views on fighting international 
narcotics crimes, especially those originating in Asia's 
notorious "Golden Triangle," the sources said. 
  The two sides agreed on the necessity of strengthening their 
efforts in fighting the drug trade. 
  The Chinese side said it hoped the U.S. would adopt measures 
to remove any barriers impeding the two nations from working 
together to stop the drug trade. 
  Gelbard was quoted by the sources as saying he would "try 
his 
best" to do so. 
  Gelbard also held talks on illegal immigration with Zhang 
Hongxi, Director of the Consular Affairs Department of the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  During their meeting Zhang outlined factors contributing to 
smuggling and illegal immigration, reiterated China's opposition 
to such activities and discussed what steps have been taken to 
combat them. 
  Zhang asked the U.S. to clamp down on the so-called 
"snakeheads"- those involved in smuggling Chinese people to the 
U.S. 
  He said that China opposes the U.S. Government offering 
political asylum to these smugglers. 
  Such people, he said, falsely claim they are fleeing 
political persecution in China. 
  And he added that China's view on granting asylum 
indiscreetly is that it encourages smuggling. 
  The Chinese officials said that normal exchanges between the 
two countries should continue and that they hoped the U.S. 
Government would help Chinese who apply for visas from the 
country. 
  Gelbard said the U.S. is formulating new laws to crack down 
on international crime organizations. 
  He also said the US is willing to strengthen co-operation 
with China to combat crime. 
  And relevant U.S. departments are ready to work with their 
Chinese counterparts, the U.S. official said. 
  At the meeting, the two sides agreed to establish an ad hoc 
consultation system, further strengthen bilateral exchanges and 
co-operation between law-enforcing departments, exchange 
information and take effective measures to punish those who 
smuggle people. 
  Describing his talks with the Chinese officials as "frank, 
friendly and productive," Gelbard told reporters that both sides 
"expect greater cooperation at all levels." 
  Gelbard left Beijing yesterday for Fujian, Guangdong and 
Yunnan Provinces en route to Thailand and Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today 
that a long-term, stable cooperation and friendship between 
China and Russia is of great significance to their prosperity 
and stability, and to peace and stability of the world as a 
whole. 
  Qian said this at a meeting with visiting Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. 
  Qian said that China, the most populous country in the 
world, 
is a big developing country with a vigorous economy, while 
Russia is a country with a vast territory, rich industrial 
technology and natural resources. 
  He said that it is important for China and Russia, neighbors 
and both permanent members of the Security Council of the United 
Nations, to strengthen mutual friendship and cooperation. 
  Kozyrev said that another Sino-Russian summit should take 
place this year so as to push bilateral relations to a new stage. 
  Just as President Boris Yeltsin stressed during his China 
visit in December 1992, Kozyrev said, further development of 
Russian-Chinese ties enjoys priority in Russia's foreign 
policies and it would not be affected by domestic political 
changes in Russia. 
  Qian said that China attaches importance to the dialogue and 
contacts between leaders of the two countries, which he believed 
were significant to promoting mutual understanding and trust and 
enhancing the good-neighborly relations between the two sides. 
  Qian expressed his satisfaction over the recent development 
of the Sino-Russian ties. 
  He noted that high-level contacts between the two sides also 
maintained momentum and the bilateral economic and trade 
relations have been further developed. The trade volume between 
China and Russia hit over seven billion U.S. dollars. 
  Qian said that Yeltsin's China visit in 1992 gave a big push 
to the development of Sino-Russian ties. 
  Briefing the guests on China's stand of banning nuclear 
tests 
and non-use of nuclear arms, Qian said that the provisions 
concerning the mutual non-use of nuclear weapons in the 
Sino-Russian joint communique is very important. 
  Kozyrev told Qian about the new theories on national defense 
of Russia, saying that they are of totally defensive. 
  The Russian foreign minister said that the Russian side is 
willing to participate in China's construction of large 
projects, such as the Three Gorges Project. 
  Following the meeting, the two foreign ministers signed two 
documents: an agreement between the two governments on ports in 
border areas and a protocol on consultations between the foreign 
ministries of the two countries.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The current China 
visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is expected to 
inject renewed vigor into the economic and trade relations 
between the two countries. 
  The Russian foreign minister arrived here Wednesday [26 
January], taking with him quite a number of officials and 
business people from various parts of the country, indicating 
that Russia is ready to further its economic and trade 
cooperation, including border trade, with China. 
  Sino-Russian trade volume in 1993 hit a record 7.68 billion 
U.S. dollars, an increase of some 30 percent over the previous 
year. 
  Of this, Russia's import from China amounted to 2.69 billion 
U.S. dollars and its export to China was 4.99 billion U.S. 
dollars, remaining the seventh biggest trading partner of China. 
  China mainly exported to Russia grain, food, light 
industrial 
goods and textiles, household electrical appliances and raw 
materials, and imported Russian power plant equipment, vehicles, 
steel, chemical fertilizer and electronics and machinery. 
  The economies of China and Russia are mutually 
complementary, 
and economic and trade exchanges between the two countries, 
which is in the interest of both, will cater to the needs of 
each other's economic development and life of the two peoples. 
  China supports, as always, positive development of 
Sino-Russian cooperation in trade, economy and technology based 
on equality and mutual benefit and encourages its companies and 
enterprises to cooperate with Russia in various fields, a trade 
official said. 
  At present, bilateral economic and trade cooperation are 
being diversified to cover traditional barter trade, 
over-the-counter trade and compensation trade. 
  During the first 10 months of 1993, China signed 420 
contracts with Russia for providing labor services, involving 
470 million U.S. dollars. 
  China also invested some 82 million U.S. dollars in nearly 
500 joint ventures in Russia. 
  China and Russia agreed at a meeting held in March last year 
that the two countries would cooperate in the fields of building 
materials, information technology, instrument making, 
metallurgy, agriculture, chemicals, and micro-electronics. 
  By the end of last June, China had imported a dozen Russian 
technological projects for aviation, power and metal processing, 
with a total value of 400 million U.S. dollars, while exporting 
to Russia some 50 technological projects valued at 120 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  However, there are some snags in the Sino-Russian trade, 
such 
as poor transportation facilities. 
  A trade official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation said that China is willing to make 
concerted efforts with Russia in 1994 to consolidate what had 
been achieved in trade and cooperation between the two countries. 
  He hoped that both China and Russia would take some measures 
to strengthen management of each other's enterprises dealing 
with foreign trade and improve investment environment, so as to 
further bilateral co-operation.

  [Text] Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
is offering too much advice on personnel affairs in Russian 
Government while offering too little assistance, Russian 
Ambassador Vladimir Lyukin said here today. 
  Lyukin, who will leave the post and return home to serve as 
chairman of the parliament's international affairs committee, 
said the Russian people were very disappointed with U.S. efforts 
to help their country, the ASSOCIATED PRESS reported. 
  "I am not so insistent and urgent on advice from my foreign 
friends on how to behave either toward my country or their 
country," Lyukin said. 
  His comments on personnel affairs stemmed from the rising 
U.S. concern over the departure of Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fyodorov, both pro-Western, from the new Russian cabinet. 
  Lyukin said Washington should care less about "which 
gentleman in our country should become minister of trade, 
minister of finance, minister of something else." 
  He criticized the apparent U.S. position that "three or four 
charismatic personalities will personify all this democracy." 
  "If it is the American understanding of what democracy is, 
it 
is strange for me," Lyukin said. 
  At the U.S. State Department, spokesman Mike McCurry said 
"it 
is less the personalities at issue and more the policy that is 
reformers who is of utmost concern to the United States." 
  Acknowledging that "those reforms who most associated with 
the policies of reform...might have been in the best position to 
carry out those policies," McCurry said Washington will "wait to 
see" if the new Russian administration would continue to fight 
inflations and ease pains for the ordinary Russians. 
  During today's interview, Lyukin also criticized 
Washington's 
trying to dictate "where to deliver, whom to deliver" the 
assistance. 
  He insisted that economic aid should be 
government-to-government rather than to specific ministries that 
the west "consider progressive and not to those they consider 
less progressive." 
  Lyukin has been ambassador to the U.S. for about two years.

  [Text] Moscow, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov resigned Wednesday [26 January] 
immediately after failing to reach an agreement with President 
Boris Yeltsin on the make-up of the new government, sources in 
the Kremlin said. 
  During their meeting held this morning, Fedorov insisted 
that 
Chairman of the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko and Deputy 
Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha be sacked and that he 
himself retain the post of a deputy prime minister. 
  The conditions were not accepted by the president, the 
sources said. 
  Last Tuesday, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced 
the list of the new government formed under a presidential 
order. According to the list, Oleg Soskovets became first deputy 
prime minister, Antoliy Chubays, Zaveryukha and Yuriy Yarov were 
named deputy prime ministers.

  [Text] Moscow, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Vladimir Shumeyko, 
speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, today reiterated 
that the reshuffled government will stick to the reforms 
underway in Russia. 
  He said the new government will not reverse the reform 
process, as feared by some enthusiastic reform advocates, 
especially after the departure of former Deputy Prime Ministers 
Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov. 
  Shumeyko indicated that their departure only represents a 
change in economic policies, and that the new government is 
shifting its efforts to stimulate production. 
  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
announced a shift from the purely monetary methods of managing 
the economy as pursued by Gaydar and Fyodorov. 
  Fyodorov, also former minister of finance, today formally 
quit that post following his earlier refusal to remain in the 
new cabinet. 
  Sergey Dobinin, his former first deputy, has since been 
appointed acting minister under a decree by President Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  Fyodorov disclosed that he recommended Dobinin for the post 
as he thought Dobinin was "the best choice". 
  Shumeyko ruled out an altered government attitude toward the 
West following the departure of Gaydar and Fyodorov, saying 
"Russia will maintain its relations with Western partners as 
ever." 
  But at the same time he pointed out that Russia, as a 
"sovereign nation, will not allow anyone speaking to it in a 
chiding manner." 
  Shumeyko also told the press that presidential power has 
been 
consolidated as a result of the December legislative elections 
and the government reshuffle. 
  The speaker of the Federation Council denied speculation of 
a 
dispute between the president and the prime minister over 
economic policies.

  [Text] Kiev, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Ukraine will further 
trim its armed forces under a restructuring plan still under 
consideration. 
  The "PEOPLE'S ARMY" newspaper today quoted Defence Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy as saying that Ukraine will demobilize another 
70,000 men to bring the size of the armed forces down to 455,000 
by the end of this year. 
  Ukraine has already demobilized 200,000 people since it 
inherited a military force of 720,000 men in 1991 when the 
former Soviet Union broke up. 
  He said the strength of the armed forces should be capped 
within 450,000 men, or 0.8 percent of the country's population. 
The figure was decided by parliament last October. 
  The total strength should be kept between 200,000 and 
250,000 
men if Ukraine is to comply with relevant international 
agreements. 
  The slimming operation is only one component of the 
restructuring plan. War industries and science and technology 
are also essential for the armed forces to be "lean and mean". 
But the minister did not elaborate.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has promulgated a new law on 
foreign investments. 
  The law, called "Joint Venture Act," contains several 
amendments to a 1984 law on foreign investment bearing the same 
title, and was adopted by the DPRK Parliament on January 20. 
  The law said that the DPRK Government is "especially" 
interested in establishing joint ventures with foreign companies 
or individuals with modern technology, highly competitive 
products, infrastructure construction projects and scientific 
and technological research programs. 
  The runner of the joint venture will be its owner and can 
decide the company's policy independently. 
  The law also called on ethnic Koreans living outside DPRK to 
invest in the country and said that preferential treatment will 
be given to them in regard to taxes and land use. 
  There are now some 150 DPRK-foreign joint ventures in the 
country and dozens of others abroad.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Liao Ching-ping (1675 </F>
7234 5493): "Jilin and DPRK Have Reached Agreement on Joint 
Development and Use of Chongjin Port"] 
  [Text] Changchun, 25 Jan (TA KUNG PAO) -- This reporter 
has learned that new progress has been made in the development 
of a big golden triangle at Tumen Jiang in Northeast Asia. The 
Yanji Industrial and Communication Material Trading Company of 
Jilin Province and its Korean counterpart has recently reached 
an initial agreement, where the said company will invest 370 
million yuan to jointly develop Chongjin Port in the DPRK. This 
is one of the starting moves to develop a big golden triangle in 
Northeast Asia. 
  Chongjin Port is a free port of the DPRK opened to the 
outside world. It is located in DPRK at the edge of the big 
golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in northeast Asia, the 
development of which has been decided by the UNDP [United 
Nations Development Program]. It is also the starting point for 
a Eurasian railroad, which holds a vital position in the 
development of a big golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in 
northeast Asia. 
  As disclosed by a relevant source, the Yanji Industrial and 
Communication Material Trading Company began to contact relevant 
parties of the DPRK in many ways last year, and reached an 
initial agreement to jointly develop and use Chongjin Port. 
According to the agreement, the Chinese company will be 
responsible for the transformation and extension of the East 
Chongjin Port, and the period for cooperation and use will be 50 
years; both sides will be collectively responsible for the 
construction of the Hoeryong-Chongjin Highway with a total 
length of 95 km and a hotel with an area of 30,000 square 
meters. The total investment amount from the Chinese side for 
the extension of the port and the construction of a highway and 
the hotel will be 370 million yuan. After Chongjin Port comes 
into use, ships from countries and regions including the ROK, 
Japan, the United States, Taiwan, and Hong Kong will be allowed 
to enter and exit the port, and the DPRK will provide 
preferential terms and other measures of guarantee. 
  The handling capacity of the port after expansion will 
increase from over 1 million metric tons now to over 20 million 
metric tons. Certainly, this will substantially promote economic 
cooperation and trade exchanges in Northeast Asia and the world. 
In the meantime, it will also alleviate a shortage of ocean 
transport among the countries of the Northeast Asia region, 
activate the economy in the big golden triangle, and expedite 
the development of the lower reaches of the Tumen Jiang.

accounting for 71 percent of the port's total and an increase of 
62 percent over the previous year. 
  A local official noted that Weihai is concentrating on 
expanding its processing industry in co-operation with the 
neighboring country.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 27 (XINHUA) -- JVC-Shanghai 
Electronics Co. Ltd, the first profitable joint venture in the 
Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone here, has decided to invest 10 
million U.S. dollars more to expand production. 
  The Sino-Japanese venture was one of the first 
transnationals 
to enter the free trade zone, which went into operation in March 
1992. 
  The extra investment will be put into the manufacturing of 
audio equipment and video cassette recorders, according to Cui 
Changshun, chairman of the company. He said that the products 
will be exported to the United States, Canada and Southeast 
Asian countries. 
  Last December alone, the firm recorded a sales value of 130 
million yuan by selling big-screen television sets, high-end 
audio equipment, camcorders and video cassette recorders. Of 
these commodities, 70 percent were exported and the rest were 
sold on the Chinese market. 
  Cui attributed the economic performance to preferential 
policies enjoyed by corporations in the zone. The policy does 
not require licenses for import and export goods, which are also 
exempted from tariffs. 
  The Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone is projected to cover ten sq 
km. Construction has so far been completed on forty percent of 
the development area, which has absorbed more than 860 projects 
and 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in total investment.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 
1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- Addressing a national 
conference on propaganda and ideological work today, Li Peng, 
member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and Premier of the State Council, pointed out: 
The development of the domestic and international situation has 
created very good conditions for strengthening our propaganda 
and ideological work, and has set still higher requirements on 
it. Proceeding from the overall interest of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, party committees and governments 
at all levels should strengthen their leadership over propaganda 
and ideological work to promote the prosperity and development 
of propaganda and cultural work. 
  Comrade Li Peng's speech consists of four parts: 1) The 
international situation and the conduct of China's foreign 
affairs; 2) China's economic growth; 3) the reform of the 
country's economic structures; and 4) the hopes for propaganda 
and ideological work. 
  In his speech Li Peng said: The important speech made by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the beginning of the meeting profoundly 
expounded the status and role of our propaganda and ideological 
work in the new period, and explicitly defined the fundamental 
policy and major tasks for this work. All departments on the 
propaganda and ideological front should conscientiously carry 
out the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech in order to 
do their work more efficiently. 
  Concerning the international situation and the conduct of 
China's foreign affairs, Li Peng pointed out: The current 
international situation is complex and still undergoing a 
profound change. The trend toward multipolarization of the 
world pattern is developing at rapid pace. Economic 
invigoration has become the universal desire of the world's 
nations, and economic priorities are becoming a major factor 
affecting the development of international relations. In many 
regional hot spots conflicts have been resolved or reduced. This 
is the positive side of the development of the international 
situation. However, we should also be aware that hegemony and 
power politics still exist, that in some regions armed conflicts 
and turbulence are still continuing, unpredictable factors are 
increasing instead of decreasing, the economic gap between North 
and South is widening, and many developing countries are facing 
more difficulties. All this shows there is still no peace in 
the world. In short, the two major problems of peace and 
development have not been resolved. Li Peng said: Compared 
with other regions of the world, the Asian region, particularly 
the east Asian region, is relatively stable politically. In 
particular, there is sustained economic growth, a rapid 
development in trade and investment, and a strong momentum in 
regional cooperation in these regions. 
  Li Peng pointed out: By pursuing an independent foreign 
policy of peace, our country has made major progress in 
relations with other countries. The official meeting between 
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton last November was 
not only conducive to the improvement and development of 
Sino-U.S. relations but has also had a positive impact on the 
situation in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a 
whole. We are in favor of striving to move, as soon as 
possible, Sino-U.S. relations onto the track of normal 
development in the spirit of "increasing trust, reducing 
trouble, strengthening cooperation, and refraining from 
confrontation." He said: On the whole, there has been an 
improvement and development in our country's relations with 
Western Europe. The visit to China by German Chancellor Kohl 
indicates that Sino-German relations have entered a new 
development stage. The upcoming visit to our country by French 
Prime Minister Balladur indicates the normalization of 
Sino-French relations. Because China pursues a policy of good- 
neighborliness and friendship, its surrounding environment has 
witnessed one of the best periods since its founding. Our 
friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries 
have been further strengthened. 
  Li Peng pointed out: This year there will be new changew and 
adjustments in international relations. The international 
situation as a whole will still be favorable to our country. In 
the new year, we should continue to pursue an independent 
foreign policy of peace, refrain from drawing a line of 
demarcation on the basis of difference or sameness in social 
systems and ideology, and develop friendly relations and 
cooperation with all countries on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence, so as to create a favorable 
external environment for our country's modernization drive. 
  On economic development, Li Peng said: Our country is in a 
period of development rarely seen in history. Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out: "The key to seizing Opportunities to develop 
ourselves lies in developing the economy." Because the current 
international environment is quite favorable and domestic 
conditions are right, it is entirely possible for us to strive 
to achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy for a fairly long time to come. He pointed 
out: Reform and opening up have installed great vitality into 
economic development. Actively advancing reform aimed at 
establishing a socialist market economic structure in accordance 
with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee will 
provide an institutional guarantee of economic development. 
Moreover, our country's political stability, national unity, and 
social progress have also created social and political 
conditions that are conducive to sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. 
  Li Peng said: In arranging economic work, we should consider 
the overall situation, correctly analyze and follow the 
situation, recognize favorable conditions while paying attention 
to unfavorable factors, actively pursue development according to 
our abilities, and make every effort to maintain an active but 
safe development speed. He pointed out: Improving economic 
efficiency and achieving the unity of speed and efficiency are 
our country's important principle of economic development. To 
raise efficiency, we should work hard in various fields, such as 
optimizing the economic structure, promoting technological 
progress, and improving operations and management. In actively 
promoting the change of operating mechanisms in enterprises, all 
types of enterprises should conscientiously strengthen 
operations and management, tighten internal discipline, and view 
these two tasks as long-term, basic work and carry them out in 
real earnest. 
  Li Peng pointed out: The principles for this year's economic 
work are: To fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, take an important step in reform toward 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, open wider 
to the outside world, tighten and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic 
structure, promote technological progress, improve economic 
efficiency, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. We should stress work in 
three areas -- comprehensively developing the rural economy, 
efficiently running state-owned large and medium enterprises, 
and tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
  On reform of the economic structure, Li Peng said: The main 
aspects of this year's reform of the economic structure can be 
summarized in three areas: 1) We should make organizational 
efforts to introduce and implement various major reform measures 
to establish a sound macroeconomic regulatory and control 
system, placing emphasis on reform of the financial, taxation, 
and banking systems. 2) We should advance price reform actively 
but steadily. We should assume a very prudent attitude and fully 
consider the extent to which the state, enterprises, and people 
can afford, in order to maintain social stability. 3) 
Establishing a modern enterprise system suited to socialist 
market economic development is the direction in which reform of 
our country's state-owned enterprises should proceed. 
Enterprise reform should be conducive to enhancing the vitality 
of state-owned enterprises, preserving and increasing the value 
of state-owned assets, and maintaining social stability. 
  Li Peng said: This year's reform and development tasks are 
quite heavy. We should correctly handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability. Economic 
development is the focus of all our work, reform is a powerful 
motive force behind social and economic development, and 
stability is an indispensable condition for reform and 
development. We should actively advance reform while adopting a 
prudent approach. We should seize Opportunities to achieve 
substantial progress in important areas, promote overall reform 
on that basis, and integrate all aspects of reform into a whole. 
  Speaking of propaganda and ideological work, Li Peng said: 
Propaganda and ideological work is our party's political 
advantage. The progress of revolution and construction is 
inseparable from the support and guarantee of propaganda and 
ideological work. The propaganda and ideological front has 
played an important role in reform, opening up, and 
modernization over the past 15 years. The propaganda and 
ideological front has earnestly implemented the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, publicized Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and done a great deal of work in encouraging 
the entire party and people across the country to study Volume 3 
of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; in carrying out 
education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; in 
publicizing and reporting on reform, opening up, and economic 
construction; in intensifying external propaganda work; and in 
enriching people's cultural lives. All in all, the guiding 
thought for propaganda and ideological work is clear, and public 
opinion is being properly guided. 
  Li Peng expressed the hope that comrades on the propaganda 
and ideological front would continue to provide proper guidance 
over public opinion and better serve reform, opening up, and 
modernization. We should make every effort to ensure that our 
propaganda and reporting are complete, objective and accurate; 
we should guard against one-sidedness. In carrying out 
propaganda and ideological work, we must proceed from the 
fundamental interests of the party and state, and 
conscientiously remain at one with the party Central Committee 
politically. He said: All departments engaged in propaganda 
and ideological work should persistently emancipate their minds 
and seek truth from facts, earnestly sum up their experiences in 
light of their own characteristics, carry out work creatively, 
and actively explore new methods for carrying out propaganda and 
ideological work under socialist market economic conditions. We 
should assiduously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the party 
and state's principles and policies, acquire socialist market 
economic know-how, and gain and master professional knowledge 
pertaining to our specialized fields. We should not only 
acquire book knowledge but should also learn in practice, from 
the masses, and from society. 
  Li Peng pointed out: In recent years, our country's external 
propaganda departments have done a great deal of work and 
achieved some results. To open wider to the outside world, we 
should better carry out external propaganda work so that the 
rest of the world will understand China. 
  Li Peng said: Government departments at all levels should 
attach importance and lend support to propaganda and ideological 
work, provide cadres engaged in such work with the necessary 
working conditions, and actively help them solve practical 
problems. We should be willing to spend some money in this 
respect and choose to economize in other areas, so that the 
conditions on the propaganda front will improve gradually and 
our propaganda work will become more fruitful. He emphasized: 
As propaganda and ideological work goes, we shoulder a glorious 
mission and heavy responsibilities for the socialist 
modernization drive. I believe that this conference will surely 
create a new situation in propaganda and ideological work. 
  Leading comrades Zhu Rongji, Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li 
Tieying, Qian Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin 
attended the conference, which was chaired by Ding Guangen.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Weiping (2621 4850 1627) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Jiang Peng (5592 7720)] 
  [Text] Chongqing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- While inspecting 
Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province, Li Tieying, CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau member and State Councillor, 
and concurrently minister in charge of the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission, said: Under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and in the course of implementing the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, Sichuan should proceed from its own realities to 
emancipate the mind, blaze a new trail for its inland areas to 
accelerate reform and open to the outside world, and strive to 
promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
Pilot cities should take the lead in exploring and in 
establishing a new socialist market economic system. 
  From 6 to 11 January, Li Tieying inspected Chengdu and 
Chongqing, heard reports by the relevant departments in Sichuan 
Province as well as in the two cities, and held discussions with 
managers and factory directors of medium-sized and large 
enterprises in Chengdu and Chongqing, and together with 
responsible persons from various cities, prefectures, and 
autonomous prefectures in the province who attended the meeting, 
during which they jointly looked into issues related to reform 
and development. While in Chongqing, Li Tieying also visited 
the Qingling Automobile Company, Ltd., the construction industry 
company (group), the Nanping farm market, and the Chongqing 
means of production exchange. 
  Li Tieying pointed out: There is no ready-made model for 
building a socialist market economy. Sichuan has made an early 
start in reform; both Chongqing and Chengdu are pilot cities for 
a complete set of reforms. You have attained great achievements 
in the process of reform and created much experience which 
should be continuously summed u. Constant efforts should be 
made to study how to implement comprehensive reforms, and how to 
tackle new situations and new problems that have cropped up in 
the course of moving forward as a whole, and efforts should be 
made to create many more new experiences. Urban economic 
restructuring must be comprehensive with emphasis on key areas; 
we should not deal with only a certain aspect in isolation 
without taking other aspects into account. Currently, we should 
focus our comprehensive reforms on transforming the operating 
mechanism of state-run enterprises, establishing a modern 
enterprise system, and carrying out macroeconomic regulation and 
control nationwide. He stressed: In the course of reform, the 
government serves both as a director and a protagonist. We have 
to count on the government to play a leading role in instituting 
a modern enterprise system while it is itself also engaged in 
transforming its own functions. At the same time, we should 
change the situation in which enterprises have for a long time 
had to bear the heavy burden of "running society" under the 
planned system. Social functions should be divorced from 
business operations, and a social security system should be 
gradually established and perfected. Only when these problems 
are solved can enterprises show their vitality in market 
competition. 
  Touching on cultivating and developing a market system, Li 
Tieying said: We must promote the development of markets for 
factors of production, financial markets, and technology 
markets, and also pay attention to developing intermediate 
agencies such as accounting, auditing, and law offices. We 
should handle the relevant affairs through these intermediate 
organizations in accordance with the law. 
  While hearing reports in Chengdu and Chongqing, Li Tieying 
stressed the need to quicken the pace of opening to the outside 
world. He said: Sichuan must further step up its construction 
of transportation, telecommunications, and energy facilities. 
At the same time, it should strive to establish a new economic 
structure and a sound operational mechanism, and constantly 
improve its investment in elements of the intangible 
environment. Greater efforts should be made to attract more 
business and funds, as well as to absorb funds, technology, and 
qualified personnel from other parts of the country and the 
world. 
  While hearing reports on the supply and marketing of grains 
and edible oil products, Li Tieying said: It is necessary to 
correctly and properly handle the relationships between 
producers, operators of businesses, and consumers, but most 
important of all, we must mobilize producers' enthusiasm to 
achieve an agricultural bumper harvest and ensure growth in the 
output of grain and edible oil products. We must study how to 
speed up the reform of the grain structure and establish a 
reserve system and risk funds. We must proceed from the 
interests of the masses of the people and pay due attention to 
stabilizing prices of grains and edible oil products, as well as 
to maintaining market stability.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- To provide an 
organizational guarantee for China's reform, development and 
stability, further improvement is needed in building leading 
bodies at all levels, according to a party official. 
  The official, from the Organizational Department of the 
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said this at a 
forum attended by leaders from the party's organizational 
departments at all levels which closed here today in Beijing. 
  He stressed the importance of the study of Deng Xiaoping's 
works and his theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and its relation to the formation of leading 
bodies. 
  He pointed out that the emphasis should be placed on the 
building up of ideology and work style in strengthening the 
leading bodies. 
  It should also be linked with the anti-corruption campaign, 
he added. 
  The official said that it is necessary to maintain and 
safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee in order 
to enable the policies and reform measures made by the Central 
Committee to be carried out successfully. 
  He said that redoubled efforts should be made to foster and 
select outstanding cadres, both young and middle-aged, to the 
leading posts. 
  Addressing the issue concerning the party's grassroots 
units, 
he said, it is necessary to explore how to enhance the building 
of the party organization in the state-owned, foreign-funded and 
township enterprises, as well as in the private sector. 
  He said that the pace of reform of the personnel system must 
be quickened. 
  A scientific, classified personnel management system and a 
fair, just and competitive mechanism for selecting cadres should 
gradually be set up, in line with the principle of putting the 
cadres' management under the party's control. 
  He stressed that party organizations should take active part 
in, and give guidance to, the implementing of the state civil 
servant system in the new year.

  [Text] The Chinese Communist Party is in danger of losing 
its identity as the moral force of the country and being turned 
into just another administrative arm of government, a party 
newspaper has warned. 
  Party organizations are becoming increasing secularized and 
are disregarding their traditional role of providing "spiritual 
and ideological" guidance to the Government and the country as a 
whole, the current issue of PARTY STYLE MONTHLY said. 
  The paper complained that party members no longer referred 
to 
each other as "comrade" and treated party meetings simply as an 
administrative chore to be got over and done with as quickly as 
possible. 
  "Cadres attend meetings not to discuss important party 
issues 
but to simply issue instructions. Leading cadres don't even pay 
their party dues themselves but send someone else to do it for 
them," it said. 
  This lax attitude "posed a threat to the party's 
development, 
ideology and work ethic". 
  PARTY STYLE pointed out that while such questions as the 
form 
of address used in party meetings may seem to be mere details, 
they were symptomatic of a much wider problem. 
  The use of government rank titles such as "bureau chief" or 
"director" rather than the more egalitarian "comrade" was 
preventing a free flow of discussion and leading to the 
ossification of the party's work. "How can there be any 
criticism of leaders when the term 'comrade' is not used?" the 
paper asked. 
  By being referred to by their administrative titles, leaders 
tended to lose sight of the party's traditional humble and 
honest work ethic, it said. Analysts said the PARTY STYLE 
article reflected a deep seated crisis of identity within the 
party. 
  "Very few rank and file party members really understand what 
the party actually stands for nowadays, nor do they really 
care," a Chinese political observer said. 
  Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's theory of "building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics", which is supposed to be 
the guiding light of the party, was so vague as to be virtually 
meaningless, he said. 
  "So, without any real ideological direction, cadres are just 
getting on with business the best they can and ignoring 
ideological questions they can't answer. 
  "At least under Chairman Mao Zedong everyone knew where they 
stood but now there just seems to be mass confusion." 
  Other analysts pointed out that because of the party's 
failure to separate itself from the work of government, it was 
perhaps inevitable that the party structure would become 
subsumed into the structure of government. 
  And while PARTY STYLE has sounded the alarm bell, most 
analysts agree it will be difficult for the party to recover its 
old identity in a rapidly changing and modernising China.

<F P=106> [By Fionnuala Halligan] </F>
  [Text] China has moved to limit film co-productions and 
completely stamp out movie-making joint ventures in a set of new 
rules which are alarming Hong Kong filmmakers. 
  Furthermore, the Ministry of Culture wants to have all films 
shot on the mainland processed and censored in China--even if it 
is not going to be released domestically. 
  This is despite the existing rule that all scripts be 
approved by the authorities before permission is given to film. 
  The moves come as part of a crackdown on Western 
infiltration 
in China, which saw laws recently passed banning the private 
ownership of satellite dishes. They are also connected to 
China's embarrassment over two "anti-government" productions 
shown internationally last year, Beijing Bastards and The Blue 
Kite. 
  Under the new regulations, only 26 co-productions will be 
allowed annually on the mainland. Last year more than 30 Hong 
Kong productions were shot in China. It is not clear whether 
all these will in future be classified as co-productions. 
  At present, a producer wishing to film in China must either 
pay one of the 16 officially sanctioned Chinese studios for 
co-operation and use of the studio (a production "in association 
with"), or the Chinese studio can invest in the film making it a 
co-production. 
  "We don't really know where we stand now," said the head of 
the Hong Kong Motion Picture Association Peter Tsi. 
  "We still haven't received any confirmed reports. We will be 
taking this up with the New China News Agency [XINHUA] at our 
next meeting for clarification. 
  "This is not a beneficial thing for the Chinese film 
industry 
and we wonder do they know this." The new rules come as Chinese 
movies--largely backed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese production 
companies--are gaining wide international recognition. 
  Last week, Chen Kaige's Farewell to My Concubine won the 
Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. If joint ventures are 
banned, such productions may not be possible in future. "If 
their objective is to stop film-makers seeking finance from 
abroad, then they may well succeed," said Hong Kong producer Shu 
Kei. "I know I would not agree to these conditions." 
"Definitely, the Hong Kong and Taiwanese film industries will 
be hit the hardest." 
  "It's hard to know how this will pan out," said Barbara 
Robinson of ERA, which produced award-winning director Zhang 
Yimou's Huozhe (To Live), currently in post-production. 
  "It's obvious China is trying to control this thing a little 
bit better. But we are still very comfortable in our 
relationship with the authorities. Pronouncements are one 
thing; how the policy gets worked out is another."

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (CNS)--The China State 
Capabilities Report written by Doctor Wang Shaoguang and 
Doctor Hu Angang and considered the foundation for policy-making 
in the fields of reform of finance and taxation to be carried 
out this year has been published by the Liaoning People's 
Publishing House. 
  The 200,000-word article originally titled "Strengthening 
the 
Dominant Role Played by the Central Government in the Change to 
a Market Economy" was completed last June and drew the immediate 
attention of the Chinese leadership including the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the 
Chinese People's Poltical Consultative Conference, all of which 
circulated the full text while major mass media across the world 
gave it a prominent coverage. 
  The report on the national situation aroused great interest 
at home and abroad mainly because of its exposure of certain 
problems facing China including its weakening capabilities. The 
report suggested that reform did not amount to the releasing of 
power to lower levels and the getting rid of profit, and opening 
the country to the outside world did not account for the general 
practice of preferential policies being given to foreign 
businessmen. The report also put forward some concrete 
proposals on the upgrading of national strength and the building 
up of a stable relationship between the central authorities and 
local ones and many of these proposals were accepted by the 
leadership in the country. The proposals called for a 
continuous increase of financial revenue put at 25 percent for 
the short term, 30 percent for the middle term and over 35 
percent for the long term. The proportion of financial revenue 
for the central authorities in the overall financial income will 
reach 50 percent in the short term, 60 percent for the middle 
term and over 65 percent for the long term. 
  Some important revisions were made to the report before its 
publication including into its concluding part three 
prerequisites for the strengthening of the dominant role played 
by the central government and five items required of the 
establishment of the market economy system. As China is now 
undertaking the 16th financial restructuring since 1949, Mr Hu 
incorporated material regarding the previous 15 financial 
changes and his comments on them into the appendix of the 
report. The article also put forward nine main policies to be 
applied to maintain the relationship between the central 
authorities and regions because the handling of the relationship 
between the central government and regions had become a hot 
issue.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (CNS)--The public security and 
border defence forces in Yunnan and Guangxi were recently 
praised for their efforts in fighting gun and drug trafficking 
there. 
  According to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, 324 
cases of gun trafficking had been smashed with 374 military 
firearms seized. Some 961 cases of drug trafficking had been 
dealt with the seizure of 812.3 kilograms of opium and 762.5 
kilograms of heroin. One hundred and thirty-six criminal gangs 
were broken in Yunnan and Guangxi last year. 
  The public security and border defence departments in the 
province and region had detailed a big number of its forces for 
border duty to strengthen inspection of arrivals and departures, 
having a 24-hour inspection service for both individuals and 
vehicles crossing at key points. 
  The border checks will be strengthened further this year. On 
New Year's Day this year, a gun trafficker was caught in Bose 
Prefecture in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region close to the 
Sino-Vietnamese border and five guns and 21 bullets seized.

<F P=106> [By reporter Mou Leng (4188 0397): "Scholar Forecasts </F>
Development of Situation in China in 1994, Noting That Slackened 
Political Reform Will Drag Out Economic Reform"] 
  [Text] Lu Jianhua, a doctor of sociology at the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that the principal 
reform factor that affects this year's social situation is 
whether political structural reform is suited to the economic 
structural reform. If political structural reform still remains 
at the level of administrative structure in a general sense, 
then it will entail two evil consequences--few results will be 
scored in reform (the problem of overstaffing in organs, for 
example), and economic structural reform will be held back again. 
  When interviewed by this reporter, Lu Jianhua pointed out: 
Although many factors that affect the trend of the social 
situation in 1994 are full of contingencies and uncertainties, 
yet the five major factors comprising reform, economic 
construction, the political situation, public will and opinion, 
and the authority of the central government are the most crucial 
ones, which can be forecast and well grasped. 
  Lu Jianhua, author of the book entitled "The 'Leftist 
Scourge' in China" under the pen name of Wen Yu (2429 5124), is 
the person who did the actual writing of the blue book "Analysis 
and Forecast of China's Social Situation" (1994), and his 
article "The Five Major Factors That Affect China's Social 
Situation in 1994" has caused strong repercussions among the 
personalities in Beijing who are concerned about the current 
political situation. People said that this was the "first 
article" written by a Chinese academic in recent years which 
"made a most pertinent and unique assessment on the situation." 
Lu Jianhua further elaborated on the five major factors that 
affected China's society this year as follows: 
  Regarding the political situation, he said: "In 1994, the 
transference of central power (i.e., from the second generation 
of the leading collective to the third generation of the leading 
collective) will enter a crucial period. History proves that in 
the variable of the political pattern in contemporary China, the 
issue of unity during the period of transference of power is the 
most difficult to tackle. Once an obstacle to unity arises, it 
will elicit massive personnel changes or even policy reversals, 
thus leading to turbulence in the social situation. During this 
year, a number of vital social interest relations are urgently 
awaiting solution. Without a united and rational central 
government, it is impossible to fulfill the above mission, and 
inappropriateness of the course of transference of power will 
lead to disastrous consequences. 
<H5>  Stability Will Be Affected by Commodity Prices </H5>
  In this connection, Dr. Lu Jianhua said that at the present 
stage, the establishment of checks and balances as well as 
compromise mechanisms of power within the central government is 
the only choice to maintain unity and rationality and, if the 
first step is made in the area of transference of power during 
the crucial period, many costs can be avoided. Lu Jianhua 
asserted that so far as 1994 is concerned, it is an historic 
opportunity to make decisions. 
  Regarding public will and opinion, they will be another 
major 
factor affecting the social situation in 1994. Lu Jianhua said: 
If reform and economic construction exert excessively heavy 
pressure-- on commodity prices in particular--on people's daily 
lives in 1994, then the awareness of interest losses caused to 
some strata will be sharpened. Last year, peasant income grew 
slowly, the income of staff and workers was insecured, and the 
declining living standard of retired people was not improved. 
All this has added weight to the pressures of living of 
considerable numbers of people, which has increased the 
possibility of their unexpected response to certain particular 
economic policies. He pointed out: In rural areas, the 
relationship between cadres and masses has been somewhat tense, 
and in urban enterprises there have been contradictions 
centering around such issues as income, democratic management, 
and others things between managers and staff and workers. A 
host of facts indicate that the work style of grass-roots 
officials is at the core of the tension between cadres and 
masses, and that its adverse impact on the people's will and 
opinion is certainly no less than that of the corruption issue. 
  Regarding the authority of the central government, he 
maintained that there will be little possibility this year of 
social unrest directly affected by factors of corruption. 
However, various kinds of frictions and conflicts triggered by 
the declining authority of the central government will be a 
hidden peril that will affect social stability. Besides, the 
revenue-sharing system will be practiced this year even though 
technical conditions have not yet entirely matured. Hence, the 
central government should make adequate forecasts of various 
possible consequences (including the intensification of local 
interests). 
  Regarding economic construction, although the rapid growth 
that has continued for two years has brought vigor and vitality 
to the entire society, yet it has been followed by a certain 
degree of confusion, disorder, and shortage of supplies, and 
various social, economic, and political mechanisms that led to 
the overheated economy have not been removed. This means that 
the social causes of economic fluctuations will not be 
completely eliminated this year, either. 
  Regarding reform, the institution of a modern enterprise 
system and structural reforms in prices, finance, taxation, 
investment, and so on, will be the focal points this year and, 
at the beginning of carrying out these reforms, a series of 
social and economic consequences will emerge, with some of them 
on the negative side, toward which a calm attitude is necessary.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Li Wei: "China Speeds Up Reform of Medical </F>
Care System"] 
  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- China will speed up 
its reform of the medical care system this year. 
  The reform will focus on the more than 40-year-old free 
health service and the labor insurance medical care system. 
  Informed sources said that the aim of the reform is to let 
the government, enterprises and individuals all rationally share 
part of the medical expenses. 
  They disclosed that the changes will include establishing a 
medical insurance fund for medical expenses of serious diseases 
and setting up individual medical care accounts which will pool 
the money from part of the raised salaries of workers. 
  The reform, which will be tested in some key cities across 
the country, will not lower the health care levels of urban 
dwellers, said an official from the National Center of Medical 
Insurance (NCMI). 
  Started in 1952, the free medical service system covered 
almost all the urban citizens working in government 
institutions, some disabled armymen and all the university 
students in China. Medical expenses of the 29 million people 
covered by the system were borne by the governments at different 
levels. 
  The labor insurance medical care system, started in 1951, 
covered the staff and workers of state-owned enterprises and 
their close relatives. More than 144 million people in China 
were covered by the system and their medical expenses were paid 
by their enterprises. 
  The free and the labor insurance medical care system has 
played an important role in protecting public health, promoting 
economic development and maintaining social stability in China 
during the past four decades, said Liu Xiufeng, vice-director of 
the NCMI. 
  However, Liu said, the disadvantages of the system are also 
obvious: The excessive use of expensive medicines, and the 
indiscriminate waste of money. 
  Statistics showed that in the latter half of the 1980s, the 
annual growth rate of medical expenditure in China in the free 
medical care sector was greater than the growth rate of the 
national financial income. 
  The free and the labor insurance medical system has made the 
government and enterprises undertake too much, while individuals 
basically did not pay any medical expenses. "Such a system goes 
beyond China's present social and economic development levels," 
said Liu. 
  In March, 1989, four cities -- Siping in Jilin Province, 
Dandong in Liaoning Province, Huangshi in Hubei Province and 
Zhuzhou in Hunan Province -- all medium-sized, were selected for 
testing the medical insurance system. 
  Meanwhile, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and in 
Hainan Province, wider reforms, covering insurance systems and 
free medical care, have achieved initial success. 
  Now, many places in China also practise the method of 
"individuals sharing part of their medical expenses." 
individuals cover 10 to 15 percent of their medical costs. The 
total paid by individuals every year to cover their medical 
expenses at most is no more than an average monthly salary. 
  "Such a method has helped people become aware of their 
medical expenses and control the waste of money and medicines," 
said Liu, adding that the practice has been used among 90 
percent of the people who used to enjoy free medical care and 80 
percent of the middle and small-sized enterprises which carry 
out the labor insurance medical care system. 
  Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang said the reform of 
China's medical care system aims to "fully use the limited 
resources, and enhance the consciousness of individuals and 
families over medical investment." 
  It is hoped that through the reform China could establish a 
multi-level social medical insurance system which is expected to 
make all the people acquire medical security and improve health.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--A quarter of all married 
women in China have had at least one abortion, according to poll 
results published Thursday in Beijing Youth News. 
  The urban abortion rate is higher than that of the 
countryside, the poll by the All China Women's Federation said. 
  In Shanghai, 41 percent of the women have had abortions at 
least once. In Beijing, close to 35 percent had had them, and 
there is a growing trend for non-married women to abort, the 
newspaper said. 
  Not all of the poll results were published. 
  The strict control over the birth rate in China since the 
beginning of the 1980s, limiting the number of births to 14 
million per year, has led to a strong surge in abortions, 
sometimes late in the pregnancy. 
  Official family planning permits only one child per urban 
couple but, in general, two for rural parents. 
  Of the women questioned, 88 percent said that abortion had 
greater consequences on a woman's health than on her reputation, 
but at least two-thirds said they would not like their 
colleagues and friends to know they had had an abortion.

  [Text] American-Based Chinese poet Bei Ling arrived in 
Hong Kong last night after having been allegedly forced by 
Shenzhen police to go through a designated exit checkpoint. 
  Bei, 34, who had been subjected to daily interrogations by 
Shenzhen security from Saturday to Tuesday for publishing an 
"illegal journal", originally wanted to leave the special 
economic zone through the Huanggang border checkpoint. 
  However, Chinese immigration officials at Huanggang, which 
is 
one of only a few exit points commonly used by foreigners, held 
him up for 1 1/2 hours before "suggesting" that he use the Lowu 
exit. 
  Bei, a green card-holder who has been resident in the United 
States since late 1988, was suspected by State Security of 
liaising with pro-democracy activists since his return to China 
last December. One thousand copies of the magazine he founded, 
Tendency Quarterly, which were printed in Shenzhen had been 
seized by the, authorities. 
  From 5 pm to 6.30 pm at Huanggang, official used several 
reasons to stop him leaving, he said. "I showed them 
[officials] my air tickets back to the States, but they claimed 
there was something wrong with them. 
  "They also suggested Hong Kong officials on the other side 
might not let me in." 
  After repeated arguments, one officer left the immigration 
counter and made a phone call, after which he suggested that Bei 
use the Lowu checkpoint. 
  At the immigration counter at Lowu, Bei said the officer had 
prolonged the processing by making numerous checks in his 
computer and putting down his particulars by hand. The poet 
claimed his picture was also taken. The immigration official 
then took a look at the clock on the wall and then waved him 
past. 
  "I suspect they [Shenzhen security] wanted me to leave 
through Lowu because they have the personnel and equipment there 
to make the proper recording," Bei said. 
  It was almost 8 pm when he arrived in Hong Kong. 
  After boarding a Kowloon-bound train, Bei said: "I'm really 
tired but I feel very peaceful here. 
  "I don't understand why the Chinese Government gave me so 
much trouble this time," he said. "My magazine is just about 
culture and literature, not politics." 
  Although he encountered a lot of trouble on his first trip 
back to China. Bei said he hoped he could return some day. 
  Bei will stay in Hong Kong until the end of this month, when 
he will go to Taiwan to promote the magazine before returning to 
the U.S.

Xinxiong, president of the China National Nuclear Corporation, 
disclosed in Beijing a few days ago that China had made 
considerable progress in exporting nuclear power equipment. The 
nuclear reactor China sold to Pakistan, he said, went into 
operation on 1 August last year. Since then the reactor has run 
satisfactorily. The two parties are now holding discussions 
about installing a second nuclear power generating unit which 
will provide 300,000 kw of electricity. 
  Jiang continued: China has signed contracts with Iran to 
sell the latter two 300,000 kw nuclear power generating units. 
The reactor China exported to Algeria for research purposes has 
now completed full power operations [shi xian man gong lu yun 
xing 1395 3807 3341 0501 3764 6663 5887] and will finally pass 
its acceptance test. Work to install the nuclear power 
generating units in Iran is expected to begin this year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- A French culture 
exhibition opened here today on the 30th anniversary of the 
establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties. 
  The one-month-long exhibition, named "The Exhibition of 
Bretagne- Finisterre", introduces with pictures, models and 
material objects the history, culture, education, economy and 
folk customs of Finisterre, the westernmost department of France. 
  It was learned that the exhibition, covering 500 sq m in the 
China Art Gallery, is in exchange for a Chinese exhibition, 
"China Yesterday and Today", which was held last December in 
France. 
  Among those present at today's opening ceremony were Lu 
Zhixian, vice-president of the Chinese Association for Cultural 
Exchanges With Foreign Countries, Jean-Yves Cozan, delegate of 
the French National Assembly and first vice-president of the 
General Council of Finisterre Department, and Thierry Audric 
[spelling of names as received], counsellor for Cultural and 
Scientific Co-operation at the French Embassy in Beijing. They 
also cut the ribbon to open the exhibition. 
  "China always attaches great importance to and cherishes its 
cultural exchanges with France," Lu told those attending the 
ceremony. "Now, when Sino-French ties have turned a new page, 
it is our common desire and responsibility to maintain and 
develop our good relations in terms of cultural exchanges." 
  Cozan said that strengthening bilateral cultural exchanges 
can help to expand the co-operation in other fields. 
  He said that people in his department have deepened their 
understanding of China through its cultural coordination with 
China, which started three years ago. 
  Many people from Finisterre have come to invest and do 
business in China, he added. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Audric said that it was of 
great 
significance that the exhibition opened on the 30th anniversary 
of the establishment of French-Chinese ties. 
  He said that the introduction of culture and folk customs 
can 
help the two nations understand each other more deeply and 
promote the development of bilateral ties. 
  The French side hopes that a new French-Chinese cultural 
agreement will be reached, and a French cultural center 
established in Beijing, Audric said, adding that two large-scale 
exhibitions on French culture would be held here within the year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Provincial Agricultural Department </F>
Releases Report: Our Province Reaps Comprehensive Agricultural 
Bumper Harvest Last Year"] 
  [Text] On 3 January, Anhui Province's Agriculture 
Department held a meeting to release information to reporters on 
last year's agricultural production, tasks for this year's 
agricultural production, and the supply and demand trend for 
principal agricultural products. 
  It has been learned that Anhui reaped a comprehensive 
agricultural bumper harvest in 1993. First, the production of 
principal agricultural products grew steadily, with that of 
grains, edible oil, meat, eggs, and milk all breaking records. 
Total grain production is estimated to have topped 25.4 billion 
kg, up 8.46 percent compared to the previous year and exceeding 
1990's production total of 25.2 billion kg. Total edible oil 
production was 31.33 million dan [one dan equals 50 kg], up 
11.86 percent compared to the previous year and exceeding 1987's 
total production of 30.21 million dan. Total silkworm cocoon 
production reached 32,300 dan, up 13.3 percent compared to the 
previous year and an increase for 15th consecutive year. Total 
meat production topped 1.372 million tons, up 6.4 percent 
compared to the previous year; total egg production was 370,000 
tons, up 2.2 percent compared to the previous year; and total 
dairy products output was 27,000 tons, up 1.5 percent compared 
to the previous year. Second, the economic efficiency of 
agriculture was raised, and peasants' incomes increased 
markedly. Anhui's total agricultural output value (in 1990 
fixed prices) is estimated to top 41.7 billion yuan, an increase 
of 3.3 billion yuan or 8.47 percent compared to that of the 
previous year. The per capita income of the province's farmers 
could reach 670 yuan, an increase of 97 yuan or 16.9 percent 
compared to the previous year. Third, market-oriented 
agriculture developed rather rapidly, and the proportions of 
high-quality agricultural products increased. The problem of 
surplus agricultural products was fundamentally solved. The 
entire province's total cultivated area of high-grade rice was 
9.31 million mu, an increase of 2.64 million mu compared to the 
previous year. In seven counties and cities, 1 million mu of 
high-yield and high-efficiency demonstration zones for 
high-grade rice cultivation were established. The production at 
these demonstration zones was generally 30 percent higher than 
that of nondemonstration zones. 
  The tasks for elevating our province's agriculture to a new 
stage in 1994 and the preliminary production goals for principal 
agricultural products this year included: 25 billion kg in 
total grain production; 6 million dan of cotton; 31.20 million 
dan of edible oil; 1.42 million tons of meat; 13 million mu of 
high-grade rice cultivation area; and the proportion of 
herbivorous animals and poultry to reach about 16 percent of the 
total agricultural output.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's 
Fujian Province has scored remarkable achievements in boosting 
economic and technological ties both within and outside the 
province. 
  Last year the overseas-oriented province launched 685 
cooperation projects with other provinces and 1,438 new 
enterprises based on internal cooperation, absorbing three 
billion yuan from other parts of the country. 
  The achievement was made by offering domestic enterprises 
the 
same preferential policies given to Sino-foreign joint ventures 
and rural enterprises, who enjoy autonomy in employment, 
distribution and management systems, among others. 
  In 1993 more than 550 domestic firms were registered in 
Xiamen city alone. 
  Cooperation thrived between the province's coastal areas and 
the mountainous interior. Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou cities 
formed economic and technological partnerships with four inland 
counties and cities to support the development of natural and 
the human resources. 
  Economic and trade cooperation with neighboring provinces 
also flourished. More than 1,200 projects were implemented last 
year, generating an output value to the tune of 2.9 billion yuan 
and profits taxes of 220 million yuan. 
  Some of the cooperative projects were signed through 
representative offices set up in Fujian by other provinces. 
Last year the province received 2,000 groups of visitors from 
other provinces who came to seek cooperation opportunities.

  [Text] Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, visited and extended regards to workers of 
financially difficult enterprises. 
  The weather was chilly and the land was frozen during the 
bitterly cold January, but the house of (Ma Qinglin), a worker 
of the No. 5 cotton mill in Jinan city, was filled with the 
atmosphere of spring. On the morning of 19 January, Jiang 
Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, and 
leading comrades of the province and Jinan city sent the warmth 
of the party and the government to his house. As soon as he 
entered the house, Secretary Jiang held the hands of (Ma 
Qinglin) and asked after his health with deep concern. He said 
cordially: We came to visit you today in order to send regards 
to all workers of your plant. On saying this, he placed a red 
envelope containing 400 yuan of relief money in his hand. Not 
having received wages for over two months, (Ma Qinglin) was so 
excited that he could not say anything. His wife, with tears in 
her eyes, said emotionally: I never dreamt that leaders would 
come to our house. The party and the government have always 
kept us in mind. I thank the party and the government for this 
and thank them for sending us relief funds. She bowed as she 
gave thanks. 
  On the afternoon of 19 January, accompanied by the party 
committee of (Huaiyun) District in Jinan city, Jiang Chunyun 
also held a forum of leaders and representatives of workers of 
financially strapped enterprises and sent relief funds to them. 
Jiang Chunyun said: Recently, in order to solve difficulties in 
the lives of workers of enterprises in the red, the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government have collected a 
relief fund of 80 million yuan to help some workers of 
financially strapped enterprises and retired personnel so that 
they may have a happy Spring Festival. To realistically solve 
difficulties in the lives of enterprise workers, the most 
fundamental thing we should do is to enhance the vitality of 
enterprises through deepening enterprise reform. 
  Jiang Chunyun called on party and government leaders at all 
levels to always be concerned with the well-being of the masses, 
care for their food and clothing, listen to their voices, 
understand their difficulties, and adopt practical measures to 
help them solve difficulties. Party and government organs at 
all levels and all trades and professions should continue to 
promote the spirit of conducting all tasks by means of thrift 
and long years of hard work, resolutely check the unhealthy 
trend of using public funds to invite guests, send gifts, and 
arbitrarily issue bonuses and articles, share the happiness and 
hardships of the masses of people, and realistically spend the 
Spring Festival in an honest, clean, civilized, peaceful and 
harmonious manner.

  [Text] The provincial government held a plenary meeting in 
Jinan on 19 January to review and sum up last year's work and to 
study methods and measures for successfully carrying out all 
tasks this year. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee and governor; and Vice Governors 
Zhang Ruifeng, Wang Jiangong, Chen Jianguo and Wu Aiying, 
attended the meeting. Zhao Zhihao put forward specific demands 
on how to guarantee the fulfillment of various work tasks this 
year. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The enterprise, financial, 
taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, pricing, housing 
reform and organizational reform measures issued this year have 
involved many levels and sectors, with many uncertainties. Only 
by going deeply to the reality to conduct investigations and 
studies, trying to find out the new situation and thoroughly 
grasping the new problems, can we be able to definitely guide 
the smooth implementation of reform. 
  Zhao Zhihao stressed: This year is one for laying a good 
foundation for the establishment of the socialist market 
economic system. To guarantee the fulfillment of all tasks, we 
must give prominence to priorities and grasp the key aspects. 
Increasing the income of peasants is the central aspect in 
rural work to which we must give a prominent place. We should 
grasp the readjustment of internal agricultural structure and 
develop high-yield, fine-quality and highly efficient farming 
and township enterprises with one hand while grasping the work 
of reducing peasants' burdens with the other hand, and guarantee 
a great rise in the average per-capita income of peasants this 
year. The industrial sector should act in close connection with 
the product strategy and regard conducting structural 
readjustment, carrying out technological transformation and 
increasing efficiency as a priority, guarantee that the 
technological transformation tasks defined by the provincial 
party committee and government be carried out in places where 
needed, and strive to greatly raise our province's product 
quality grade, technological content and ratio of products in 
the market. In foreign economic and trade work, we should have 
new ideas and measures of developing export-oriented economy 
under the new situation, expand the scale and sphere of using 
foreign capital and guarantee that the creation of foreign 
exchange through export will be higher than the whole province's 
economic growth rate. The planning and banking work must be 
coordinated with the new situation of the country's reform of 
the investment and banking systems, grasp the strengthening of 
economic development momentum as the major aspect and guarantee 
the needs of funds for accelerating development. After the 
implementation of the revenue-sharing system, the financial 
departments should strive to cultivate financial resources, do a 
good job in increasing revenue and reducing expenditures and 
increasing investments in some weak aspects, including 
agriculture, science, technology, education and social security. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The deeper we have conducted reform 
and the more we have developed the market eocnomy, the more we 
need to strengthen idological and political work and to 
persistently grasp the building of clean politics. In 
conducting anticorruption struggle and strengthening the 
building of clean politics, on the basis of consolidating the 
work achievements of the previous stage, we should make 
unremitting efforts to grasp it until good results are achieved. 
  Vice Governor Chen Jianguo gave a speech on the whole 
province's technological transformation.

  [Text] At the provincial personnel work conference which 
ended on 19 January, Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee and governor, pointed out: This year 
we should conduct organizational reform, implement the state 
public service system and promote reform of the wage system and 
social security system. This work will affect the overall 
situation and will closely relate with the interests of the 
broad masses of cadres and workers. We must implement it 
carefully and take active and reliable steps to carry it out. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: In organizational reform, the most 
crucial issues are to improve relations of various sectors, 
clearly define functions and powers, streamline organs, change 
functions, raise efficiency, render good service, and guard 
against and overcome bureaucracy and formalism. This year the 
county and township levels should comprehensively promote the 
public service system; the province and various cities and 
prerectures should encourage organs to [words indistinct] in 
line with organizational reform. All cities and prefectures 
should regard the whole process of promoting the public service 
system as a process to strengthen the building of government 
organs and raising the quality of personnel and guarantee the 
smooth implementation of the public service system. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The wage reform of organs and 
institutions has involved the immediate interests of more than 2 
million workers and staff members of organs and institutions 
across the province. We must know the policies well, strictly 
observe organizational discipline and prevent the people to do 
things in their own way or to establish new organs. It is 
necessary to do a good job in conducting in-depth and meticulous 
ideological and political work. Regarding reform of the 
insurance system of organs and institutions, the State Council 
has clearly defined that the personnel departments should take 
charge of it. Personnel departments at all levels should rapidly 
issue overall plans for reform of the social security system of 
organs and institutions in our province and enable the social 
security work of organs and instituions across the province to 
become regular and legal. 
  Vice Governor Zhang Ruifeng also attended the conference.

  [Text] Jinan, January 21 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong 
Province experienced a surge of foreign investment over the past 
year. 
  According to the latest statistics, 6,430 foreign-funded 
enterprises were registered in this coastal province in 1993, an 
increase of 160 percent over the previous year. 
  These enterprises involve a total investment of 10.58 
billion 
U.S. dollars including 3.978 billion U.S. dollars of foreign 
investment on contract. 
  So far, the province has 12,600 foreign-funded enterprises, 
with a total contractual investment of 7.1 billion U.S. dollars. 
  A survey shows that the number of countries and regions that 
have invested in Shandong rose from 29 before 1991 to 70 by the 
end of last year. 
  Foreign business people have expanded their investment scope 
from just the catering trade and motor vehicle maintenance two 
years ago to commerce, service trades, transportation, tourism, 
information and banking in addition to agriculture and industry. 
  A local official noted that the proportion of exports from 
foreign-funded enterprises last year accounted for one-fourth of 
the province's total, up from 17.5 in 1992.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju Meets TA </F>
KUNG PAO Director and Editor-in-Chief, Noting That Shanghai and 
Hong Kong Can Complement Each Other To Strive for Common 
Prosperity"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 16 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--This morning, 
Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju met with Wang Guohua, visiting WEN WEI 
PO chairman and director, and Zeng Decheng, deputy director and 
editor-in-chief, and also gave a lunch in honor of the visitors. 
  At the meeting and during lunch, Mayor Huang Ju talked a lot 
about Shanghai's tremendous changes in the last two years and 
its situation of economic development in 1993. He said: In 
1993, Shanghai met the requirements Deng Xiaoping set forth at 
the beginning of the year. Shanghai has been advancing steadily 
by braving winds and waves and overcoming difficulties, and has 
moved onto a higher development stage. 
  Huang Ju said: An advantage Shanghai enjoys is that its 
leaders can directly talk by telephone with the central leaders 
of the older generation and the incumbent central leaders of the 
third generation, so Shanghai is well-informed. Anyhow, 
Shanghai's development should still mainly rely on its own 
efforts, the efforts of the Shanghai people. 
  He said: A major change in Shanghai last year found 
expression in the establishment of large markets. Now, there 
are 11 state- level large markets in Shanghai, and the total 
yearly business turnover reached 1 trillion yuan. A loan market 
covering the whole Chang Jiang valley and the Chang Jiang delta 
area has taken form. While China's financial management center 
is located in Beijing, the transaction center is located in 
Shanghai. 
  Huang Ju said: Last year, the amount of foreign funds used 
by Shanghai doubled that in the previous year, reaching $7 
billion. The rate of fund use [zi jin jin du dai wei lu 6327 
6855 6651 1653 0451 0143 3764] reached 99.5 percent. Twenty-six 
of the 100 largest transnational enterprises in the world have 
opened offices in Shanghai. They mainly come from Europe and 
America. In terms of the fund sources, Hong Kong and Macao rank 
first among other places. Therefore, we attach great importance 
to Hong Kong. Hong Kong and Shanghai have their respective 
advantages, so they should complement each other and seek common 
prosperity. China has only one Hong Kong, and that is not 
enough. Hong Kong has a very good foundation. It is believed 
that it will better play a role as a window in the 1990's. 
  Huang Ju said: The year 1994 is a decisive year for meeting 
Deng Xiaoping's requirement of "making changes every year, and 
making substantial changes every three years," and for 
maintaining the momentum of healthy economic growth. This year, 
the target is to increase GNP by 12 percent, and we shall strive 
to achieve the growth rate of 15 percent, thus laying a solid 
foundation for Shanghai's economic development and comprehensive 
strength. Huang Ju said: "We are facing a good opportunity and 
also enjoy favorable natural, geographical, and social 
conditions, so it is absolutely possible for Shanghai to 
maintain the favorable momentum of economic growth in the new 
year." 
  Attending the meeting and luncheon also were Chen Zhili, 
deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; Jin 
Binghua, member of the Standing Committee of the municipal party 
committee and director of the Municipal Propaganda Department; 
Cai Laixing, deptuy secretary general of the Shanghai Municipal 
People's Government;, and Jia Shumu, deputy director of the 
Municipal Propaganda Department and director of the Municipal 
Information Office. 
  The WEN WEI PO delegation, composed of Director Wang Guohua, 
Editor-in-Chief Zeng Decheng, and General Manager Feng 
Zhongliang, left Shanghai for Hangzhou this afternoon. During 
their visit to Shanghai, they arranged an interview of Wu 
Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and 
secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, and visited 
Shanghai's subway, bridge, and Bund reconstruction projects.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest economic center, is striving to co-operate with more 
transnational corporations in boosting its economy this year. 
  A municipal government official in charge of economy said 
that the co-operation will be in the fields of petrochemicals, 
metallurgy, complete sets of power generating units, 
telecommunications, electronics, tires, computers and bearings. 
  Shanghai will list 100 key industrial projects, each 
scheduled to use over 10 million U.S. dollars, for co-operation 
in the forms of joint venture and co-operation. 
  "This is aimed at helping the city to update its products so 
as to better compete in the international market," the official 
noted. 
  While welcoming foreign investment in Shanghai, the 
municipal 
government will probe for new ways to use foreign capital in the 
construction of its second batch of urban infrastructure 
facilities, including power-generating units, a subway, the 
Pudong International Airport, the outer city ring road and a 
garbage treatment plant. 
  It will co-operate with foreign chain stores in the forms of 
joint venture and co-operation and try to set up Sino-foreign 
foreign trade, commercial and wholesale companies, and trading 
companies with sole foreign investment as well as share-holding 
firms. 
  According to statistics, Shanghai has absorbed a sum of 13 
billion U.S. dollars and approved the setting up of more than 
6,000 foreign-funded projects. Included are enterprises run by 
a total of 126 transnational companies. 
  One third of the 100 major transnational industrial 
corporations have set up subsidiaries in the city.

  [Text] A Guangdong provincial united front work meeting 
ended in Guangzhou this afternoon. Governor Zhu Senlin and the 
provincial deputy party secretary addressed the meeting. 
  Zhu said: Government work is closely connected with united 
front work. Government policies and principles are formulated 
through united front work by widely soliciting the opinions of 
people in various circles and all democratic parties, and 
policies and principles are implemented through democratic 
consultations. Therefore, leaders at all levels should pay full 
attention to united front work. 
  Provincial Deputy Party Secretary Zhang Guoying summed up 
the 
meeting. She stressed: In strengthening and upholding the 
united front work, three points must be ensured. The first is 
to make a success of propaganda and education so as to ensure 
that everyone understands its importance. All party and cadre 
schools should understand the central authorities' policy on the 
united front work. The second is to ensure the implementation of 
policies and principles, to cope with changes in the situation, 
and to raise our consciousness in implementing the party's 
united front work policy. The third is [words indistinct] to 
ensure the implementation of specific measures, to strengthen 
the united front work contingent, and to maintain its stability.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 22 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province, a national pace-setter in the reform and 
opening up, achieved sustained and rapid economic growth in 
1993, according to a provincial government spokesman. 
  The spokesman said that Guangdong's gross domestic product 
(GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- amounted to 
314.7 billion yuan last year, up 21 percent over the previous 
year in real terms. 
  The province's GDP has risen at an annual rate of nearly 14 
percent over the past 15 years. 
  He attributed the rapid growth partly to faster 
infrastructure construction and undertaking of top-priority 
projects. 
  In 1993, Guangdong added a total new generating capacity of 
almost four million kilowatts, built 150 kilometers of 
expressways and nearly 2,000 kilometers of highways, and 
installed switchboards with a total of 2.2 million telephone 
lines. 
  The spokesman said that Guangdong plans to undertake 31 key 
projects this year, involving investment totaling 70.3 billion 
yuan. 
  These will include a railway line, an expressway, a subway 
in 
the provincial capital of Guangzhou and six power plants. 
  This year Guangdong plans to add a total new generating 
capacity of three million kilowatts and install switchboards 
with 2.5 million lines, the spokesman said. 
  Guangdong has also expanded an export-oriented economy, he 
said. Its imports and exports amounted to 45.4 billion U.S. 
dollars in 1993. 
  Exports soared 43 percent last year to 26.3 billion dollars. 
As a result, Guangdong has exported more goods than any other 
province-level area in China for eight successive years. 
  Guangdong's major export markets include Japan, the United 
States, the European Community, the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America 
and Australia, the spokesman said. 
  He said that in 1993 Guangdong signed 19,000 cooperation 
contracts with foreign firms, involving a total overseas 
investment of 34.9 billion U.S. dollars, up 76 percent over 1992. 
  The province also scored a big increase in major 
foreign-funded businesses in 1993, he said. It had 738 such 
businesses each with an investment exceeding 10 million dollars, 
527 more than in 1992. 
  "Guangdong Province will continue to achieve rapid economic 
growth in the new year," the spokesman said. 
  GDP is expected to shoot up by 15 percent and its exports by 
15 percent this year, he said.

of 
the province, said these newly founded courts will focus on 
protecting the intellectual property of enterprises, including

  [Text] This year will be the crucial year for economic 
structural reform to make progress on all fronts and make 
breakthroughs at key links in the province. During the current 
provincial meeting on economic work, a reporter from this news 
service interviewed Zhang Zhiping, the director of the 
provincial commission for restructuring economic systems. The 
reporter asked him about the guiding idea behind economic 
structural reform in our province this year. 
  He said: This year, the guiding idea behind economic 
structural reform in our province has three special 
characteristics. First, we are to break away from the old 
structure and embrace a new one. Second, we are to change from 
the past tactic of striving for breakthroughs in individual 
areas to a new tactic, launching a coordinated reform package in 
various fields. Third, we no longer rely on policies but laws 
in order to expedite reform. 
  This year we will be shouldering a very heavy reform 
workload, as the scale, intensify, and degree of difficulty of 
the reforms will all increase. 
  In discussing the focal points of this year's reform, 
Director Zhang Zhiping said: First, we are to concentrate our 
efforts on introducing innovative enterprise systems and 
actively exploring effective way to establish a modern 
enterprise system while transforming enterprise operational 
mechanisms. Second, we will speed up the reform of the finance 
and taxation, banking, planning, and investment sectors and will 
make a major stride toward establishing a macroeconomic 
regulation and control system at the provincial level. By 
centering around these two focal points, we will work to develop 
a market system with the market of production elements as the 
core, will step up the reform of the social security and housing 
systems, and will deepen reform in such fields as external 
trade, education, and science and technology in rural areas. 
  After summing up the experience offered by the pilot 
projects 
conducted by 60 enterprises -- including Anyang Iron and Steel 
Company -- with the aim of taking stock of assets and 
establishing join ventures, we will speed up our pace in taking 
stock of the assets of all public-owned enterprises in the 
province, will verify the real value of the assets of 
enterprises and other legal entities, and will work harder to 
find out ways and measures to solve various historical issues 
that have been disturbing state-owned enterprises, thus paving 
the way for them to plunge into the market. 
  This year, 100 industrial and commercial enterprises covered 
by the state budget in this province will be selected to launch 
pilot projects for establishing the modern enterprise system, 
and our aim is to have 25 percent of such enterprises in the 
province, thus accomplishing the reform of introducing the 
company system by the end of the year. As for basic trades 
which have an important bearing on the national economy, the 
state's role as capital owner will fade out this year. In this 
connection, three to five enterprises will be selected to issue 
shares for sale on the stock market, and five to eight 
enterprises will be selected to become listed companies in major 
national stock exchanges. Meanwhile, those enterprises which 
are undertaking the pilot joint stock system projects are 
required to take stock of their assets according to the company 
law.
