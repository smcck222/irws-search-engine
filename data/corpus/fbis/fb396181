  [Text] Wuhan, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Some 100,000 
industrial workers, laid off by their factories here in Wuhan, 
have found jobs in the city's flourishing service sector. 
  The new work is proving to be even more rewarding than their 
original jobs, both for themselves and for the city authority. 
Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in central China. 
  An official from the city's office for the service 
industries 
said that these redundant workers are now playing an important 
role in restaurants, commodity retailing, labor market and other 
fields of the service sector. 
  If they had not got those jobs, the official said, their 
original enterprises and the government would have had to pay at 
least 500 million yuan a year in unemployment compensation to 
them. 
  To create new jobs for them, the city authority spent 300 
million yuan over the past years on the opening of 400 markets. 
It even provided money to those who wanted to start their own 
businesses but faced a shortage of funds, the official said. 
  The city authority has also sponsored the opening of nearly 
50 vacation schools and training centers, through which some 
40,000 redundant workers were prepared for new professions, 
according to the official. 
  Enterprises also got help from the city authority to create 
new jobs for those laid off by them. For example, the official 
said, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has successfully 
re-employed 20,000 workers it had laid off, using them in its 
many new business ventures. 
  The official said that the bringing in of these new forces 
had resulted in a great boost for the city's service industry, 
which produced a turnover of more than 10 billion yuan in 1993, 
almost four times higher than in 1984.

  [Text] A provincial work conference on finance and 
taxation ended in Changsha yesterday. 
  Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor Chu Bo 
attended and delivered speeches at the closing session in which 
they emphatically stated that 1994 is a crucial year for Hunan's 
finance and taxation system reform. Therefore, government 
departments at all levels in Hunan should become fully prepared 
for certain temporary difficulties that might arise by 
strengthening confidence, making concerted efforts, sharing weal 
and woe, and actively, assuredly, and successfully furthering 
finance and taxation system reform as well as other types of 
work. 
  Speaking on Hunan's work at present, Governor Chen Bangzhu 
pointed out: All levels and all departments across the province 
should develop the spirit of plain living and hard struggle, 
curb expenditure, and strive to maintain a sustained balance 
between revenue and expenditure. Finance departments, on their 
part, should make every possible endeavor to guarantee the basic 
livelihood of the broad masses of the people, notwithstanding 
revenue cuts resulting from policy changes and growing pressures 
in this regard, and should resolutely put an end to the practice 
of issuing IOU's to both peasants and cadres. 
  Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu noted, in particular, that 
finance and taxation departments at all levels in Hunan should 
waste no time in collecting revenue during the first quarter of 
1994. Party committees and governments at all levels in Hunan 
should take the interests of the whole into account and give 
unreserved support to finance and taxation system reform and 
finance work.

  [Text] On 15 January the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC 
Standing Committee held an enlarged meeting to make work 
arrangements for tightening the flesh-blood ties between the 
party and the people and successfully and realistically dealing 
with the practical difficulties cropping up in the people's 
livelihood. 
  Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the enlarged meeting. Attending the 
meeting were leading comrades, including Sun Weiben, Zhou 
Wenhua, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Yang 
Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, and Yu Jingchang. 
  During the meeting Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, delivered a speech in which he made 
arrangements for the province's central work at present. He 
pointed out: It is imperative to display the spirit of being 
highly responsible for the party and the people to realistically 
do a good job in dealing with the practical difficulties 
cropping up in the people's livelihood and to tighten the 
flesh-blood ties between the party and the people. He said: 
During the period before the Spring Festival, the party and 
government leading organs at all levels throughout the province 
should do a good job in organizing their personnel to go deep 
into grass-roots levels to deal with the practical problems. 
Leading cadres in the party and government organs at all levels 
should go deep into enterprises, rural villages, schools, and 
poor households in line with their work division and duty share 
so as to directly listen to the opinions and demands raised by 
workers, peasants, and intellectuals, as well as to deal with on 
the spot the prominent difficulties cropping up in the people's 
livelihood. The provincial level departments should follow the 
system of being responsible for helping the difficulty-plagued 
units to go deep into the money-losing enterprises and poor 
counties to deal with as much as possible the problems cropping 
up in production and livelihood. They should concentrate their 
efforts on successfully dealing with the prominent difficulties 
cropping up in the following three fields of the people's 
livelihood: 1) Efforts should be made to adopt every possible 
way and means to deal with the problem of having staff members 
and workers be in arrears with pay. 2) A good job should be 
done in realistically giving a helping hand to poor households. 
3) A good job should be done in realistically providing 
supplies for festive markets and stabilizing commodity prices. 
As for these problems, it is necessary to strictly assign 
duties for personnel to deal with them. As for localities and 
departments that have encountered problems because of paying 
less attention to the difficulties and adopting ineffective 
measures, their leading personnel should be held responsible for 
the problems. Sun Weiben pointed out at the same time: It is 
imperative to correctly deal with the relation between reform or 
development and stability. Party committees should regard the 
work of maintaining the social peace as the first-grade matter 
of their current work and be greatly determined to correct the 
phenomena of passiveness and corruption. They should vigorously 
publicize the social morales of selflessly making contributions, 
waging arduous struggles, and stressing thriftiness. He said: 
All of these require us to be greatly determined to deal with 
the problems of seeking private gains by taking advantage of 
power through the methods of extorting money from the masses by 
making things difficult and to handle the problems of 
extravagance and waste as well as of abnormal consumption. Sun 
Weiben also pointed out: It is imperative to enhance the 
comprehensive management of public security, to create a safe 
and orderly environment for the people's work and livelihood, 
and to mobilize the entire party and society to make concerted 
efforts to consolidate or develop the political situation of 
stability and unity.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Ying (5135 3841): "Jilin Presents Medals </F>
of Jilin's Outstanding Talents to Outstanding Intellectuals"] 
  [Excerpts] The land in north China is covered with ice and 
snow in winter. But, the assembly hall of the provincial 
guesthouse is as warm as spring. On 14 December, the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government held a meeting to 
commend a group of outstanding specialists, scholars, and 
technicians with contributions to building and rejuvenating 
Jilin and to present medals of Jilin's outstanding talents to 
them. 
  The meeting was chaired by Wang Jinshan. 
  Present at the meeting were He Zhukang, Gao Yan, Liu 
Yunzhao, 
Su Rong, Feng Ximing, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, and 
Ke Muyun. 
  At the meeting, Governor Gao Yan read the provincial party 
committee and government's decision on issuing medals of Jilin's 
outstanding talents to 1,895 specialists, scholars, and 
technicians, including Tang Aoqing. [passage omitted] 
  He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
made 
a speech at the meeting. He said: Today, the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government ceremoniously held a 
meeting to present "medals of Jilin's outstanding talents" to 
1,895 specialists, scholars, and technicians with outstanding 
contributions to Jilin's modernization and to carry forward 
their deeds. This is a great matter of our province. Over the 
past years, the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government have constantly put the work toward intellectuals on 
the important work agenda and successively worked out and 
implemented a series of policies and measures. To live up the 
expectations of the party and the people, the broad masses of 
intellectuals, with vast branches of learning, boundless wisdom, 
high enthusiasm, and the spirit of fearing no difficulties, 
keeping forging ahead, and waging an struggle, have engaged 
themselves in the great practice of reform, opening up, and 
modernization; brought their wisdom and intelligence into full 
play; and made brilliant achievements. Some of the medal 
winners present here today made prominent contributions to 
building the revolutionary base earlier before the liberation 
war. Some of them gave up their good working and living 
conditions abroad and resolutely returned home to engage 
themselves in the construction of new China and to make 
contributions to the motherland. Most of them are outstanding 
talents who grew up after liberation. They have made arduous 
efforts at different posts and handed in satisfactory 
examination papers to the party and the people. 
  He urged: The party committees and governments at various 
levels should try every possible means to eliminate difficulties 
for the intellectuals, provide them with good environments and 
conditions, positively widen the channels to establish contacts 
between scientific research units and economic units, offer a 
vast environment where science professionals and technicians are 
able to bring their skills into play, and ensure the supply of 
necessary funds for teaching and scientific research. We should 
positively improve the living and medical care conditions of 
intellectuals. The leaders at various levels should make friends 
with intellectuals, conscientiously listen to their opinions on 
the work in various aspects, and provide them with convenience 
in understanding the overall situation and engaging in social 
practice. 
  He urged: The vast number of intellectuals should 
scientifically grasp the Marxist world outlook and methodology; 
engage in scientific research and theoretical explorations along 
with an accurate orientation; carry forward the Chinese 
intellectuals' fine traditions of being concerned about the 
country and the people, making unremitting efforts to improve 
themselves, and making selfless sacrifice; go deep to the 
reality, the peasants, and the workers; attach primary 
importance to the benefits of the motherland and the people; and 
contribute their energy and wisdom to seeking benefits for the 
motherland and the people. 
  He urged: The medal winners will guard against arrogance and 
rashness, make ceaseless efforts, make new contributions to 
building a developed border near-the-sea province, and 
rejuvenating Jilin's economy.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Liaoning, China's 
base of heavy industry, earned 4.26 billion U.S. dollars from 
exports in 1993 -- 8.5 percent up on 1992. 
  Du Qiugen, deputy director of the Department of Foreign 
Relations and Trade of the Liaoning Provincial Government, 
reports that the proportion of exported heavy industrial 
products to total exports showed an increase of eight percent. 
The export volume of motors and machinery alone reached one 
billion U.S. dollars, up by 16 percent. 
  Du said that the province approved in 1993 the establishment 
of over 4,000 overseas-funded enterprises, with a total 
investment of 8.56 billion U.S. dollars. Both the figures 
surpassed the total of the previous ten years. 
  By now there are nearly 8,000 overseas-funded enterprises, 
with a total investment of 17 billion U.S. dollars, from 
businessmen in 35 countries and regions. 
  More than 2,500 overseas-funded enterprises in the province 
have gone into production. In 1993, their output value amounted 
to 18.4 billion yuan (about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars), 
accounting for 10 percent of the gross provincial product. The 
export value of the 1993 total production rose to 1.14 billion 
U.S. dollars, accounting for a quarter of the province's exports. 
  The province used over two billion U.S. dollars worth of 
overseas funds to update technically 2,000 of its old 
enterprises in 1993. It also signed 500 contracts on projects 
and on exporting labor services.

  [Text] Yinchuan, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investors 
are shifting more of their attention to Northwest China, a 
region long neglected by foreign businessmen but boastful of 
great potential. 
  Northwest China, including Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai 
Provinces and Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions, 
covers one third of the country's territory and is well endowed 
with natural resources. 
  But overseas investors were discouraged by its remoteness, 
tough climate and inconvenient communications. 
  As a result, the region has lagged far behind the rest of 
China in the drive for opening up and in economic development. 
  The 1990s, however, saw a turning point for the region, 
which is badly in need of overseas investments for an economic 
take-off. 
  Latest statistics show that overseas-funded ventures 
numbered 
more than 3,000 by the end of 1993, over ten times that at the 
beginning of the year. The figure has raised the region's 
percentage of the national total from 0.6 to 1.6 percent. 
  Contracted foreign investment has amounted to more than five 
billion U.S. dollars, the statistics indicated. 
  In Qinghai, one of the most impoverished provinces of China, 
overseas-funded firms rose from three in 1991 to over 60 by 
1993, involving a combined foreign investment of more than 96 
million U.S. dollars. 
  Foreign investments have expanded from service industries to 
sectors of energy, the exploration of raw materials, processing 
and high-tech industries. And cooperative parties have 
increased to more than 20 countries and regions. Moreover, the 
province has also improved cooperation with the World Bank and 
foreign governments in loans, technology and labour service. 
  Officials said that it is the abundance of natural resources 
and promising development prospects that have brought investors 
to Northwest China. 
  According to Liu Guanghe, vice-governor of Qinghai, more 
than 
60 of the 160 proven minerals have been found in the region, 
adding the reserves of some 20 of them rank first in the country. 
  The official cited the Tarim Basin, which has a prospective 
reserve of more than 20 billion tons of oil. He also said 
Northwest China is home to two of the three large gas fields 
already confirmed in China. 
  "The development of the vast Northwest China has a 
significant impact on the overall progress of the country, which 
is short of energy," the vice-governor said. 
  In Shaanxi, overseas-funded ventures topped 1,000 by the end 
of last year, compared to 200 two years ago. 
  "Foreign investors are assured by China's reform and 
opening-up policies as well as by the country's political 
stability," said Xu Shanlin, vice-governor of the province. 
  Officials said the improvement in investment climate in the 
region has also enhanced its competitiveness in attracting 
foreign funds. 
  Automatic switchboards have been installed in the five 
provincial or regional capital cities, and direct international 
dialing can reach more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. 
The expansion and upgrading of three airports in the region 
have completed, and direct air routes have been opened between 
the region and some major cities in the world. 
  The longest railway in China, known as Euro-Asia Continental 
Bridge, and open border cities have helped connect the region 
with the rest of the world, officials said. 
  To support economic advancement in the region, the central 
government has approved the five capitals and over a dozen of 
border cities to open to the outside world, and preferential 
policies have been granted to them. In addition, three 
state-level high-tech development zones have been established in 
Northwest China. 
  The provinces and regions, meanwhile, have promulgated 
preferential treatment policies to encourage foreign investments 
and the establishment of joint ventures. They also have set up 
organizations to coordinate overseas investments.

  [Text] Lanzhou, January 20 (XINHUA) -- By implementing 
several international cooperation programs, Gansu Province has 
remarkably improved its educational level and been praised as an 
example for other backward areas in the world. 
  Recently, the province won a high award conferred by the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) for its achievement in promoting local education. 
  Land-locked Gansu Province is one of China's poorest areas. 
Nearly 80 percent of the province survives on government 
subsidies. 
  Backward economy resulted in backward education. In 1987, 
half of the province failed to spread primary education. 
One-fifth of the people between the age of 15 and 45 were 
illiterate. 
  In addition, such problems as poor quality of teachers and 
funds shortages in schools were common in the province. 
  In 1986, Gansu Province took the lead in the country in 
joining UNESCO's "Jip Plan", which is aimed at improving the 
quality of primary education. 
  A year later, the province obtained a 20 million U.S. dollar 
loan earmarked by the World Bank for developing education. This 
was the first educational co-operation program between the bank 
and a Chinese local government. 
  Now, the UNESCO "Jip Plan" has involved over 1,000 primary 
schools and 100,000 students in Gansu and effectively upgraded 
the local primary education. 
  During the past eight years, Gansu Province has established 
relations with many international organizations, including the 
Asian and Pacific regional office of UNESCO, the World Bank, and 
the United Nations Children's Fund. 
  A series of educational programs have been carried out in 
the 
province, covering improvement of primary educational quality, 
spreading education in impoverished areas, education for girls, 
education for illiterates in rural areas, teachers' training, 
family education training, education for handicapped people and 
so on. Many of these programs have been conducted for the first 
time in China. 
  Since 1986, about 80 experts from more than 10 countries and 
international organizations have visited Gansu Province, which 
has also sent its experts to foreign countries. 
  The extensive international exchanges have opened the eyes 
of 
the province's educators, who have managed to improve their 
teaching quality by learning from their foreign counterparts. 
  The cooperation programs also enable the province to enhance 
its poorly-equipped schools. 
  In addition to the loan from the World Bank, local 
government 
allocated another 50 million yuan (5.6 million U.S. dollars) to 
renovate teaching equipment. 
  By now, the province has expanded all its five teachers' 
training schools and installed in another 23 schools modern 
teaching equipment, such as laboratories for audio-visual 
teaching as well as music, computer and language teaching. 
  Some 430 training posts via satellite television have been 
established around the province. More than 400 schools in 46 
poorest counties of the province have been equipped with 
experimental instruments for courses of physics, biology and 
chemistry.

  [Excerpts] A provincial meeting on pastoral areas opened 
in Xining yesterday to further study the instructions of the 
central rural work meeting and to discuss how to deepen rural 
reform, to strengthen the basic position of agriculture and 
animal husbandry, to promote rural economic development, and to 
arrange pastoral areas' work for the present and immediate 
future. Governor Tian Chengping chaired the meeting and 
provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng made a speech entitled 
"Improving Our Understanding, Unifying Our Thinking, and Further 
Strengthening Work in the Rural and Pastoral Areas." Provincial 
party and government leading comrades including Doba, Wang 
Hanmin, Ma Yuanbiao, and Liu Guanghe were present at the meeting. 
  In his speech, Comrade Yen Kesheng first analyzed the 
situation in pastoral areas. He said: Since the introduction 
of reform and opening up, a profound change has taken place in 
Qinghai's pastoral areas, which have made historic achievements. 
Particularly in recent years the provincial party and 
government have introduced many policies and measures to 
strengthen agricultural and animal husbandry work. At a time 
when financial resources were quite tight, the provincial party 
and government increased investment in agriculture and animal 
husbandry, and paid attention to comprehensive agricultural 
development and structural adjustment. As a result, pastoral 
areas could maintain a good trend of stable economic development 
for many years. But we should soberly understand that animal 
husbandry production is still at a low development level, that 
the foundation of animal husbandry is weak, that its production 
structure is simple, that the comparative returns in grain 
production have reduced, and that the increase in the peasants' 
income is slow. If these problems are not seriously resolved, 
they will affect the development of agriculture and animal 
husbandry and the province's national economic development and 
will also be a drag on modernization. Therefore, we should 
under all circumstances put agriculture at the forefront of 
economic work and this should become the basic guiding principle 
in Qinghai's economic work. 
  Comrade Yin Keshing pointed out: The 1990's are a crucial 
period for the province's reform and economic construction. 
Rural and pastoral areas throughout the province should further 
improve their operational mechanism so that their markets will 
be full of vitality. In line with the instructions of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, the provincial party 
committee has decided to extend the period of contracted 
farmlands for another 30 years and that the period of contracted 
pastoral areas will remain unchanged for 50 years. [passage 
omitted] 
  Comrade Yin Keshing continued: The central issue of the 
province's rural and pastoral areas is to increase the peasants' 
and herdsmen's incomes. Increasing their per capita net income 
will promote all aspects of work in the rural and pastoral 
areas. We should help the masses' increase their incomes and 
move toward moderate prosperity, and take this as the general 
objective. To achieve this end, the following two points should 
be given attention. The first is further adjusting and 
optimizing the production structure, developing township and 
town enterprises, and cultivating a high-yield, high-quality, 
and highly efficient agriculture by means of science and 
technology. The second is increasing investments, strengthening 
basic facilities construction for agriculture and animal 
husbandry, and improving production conditions. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] On the afternoon of 20 January, the provincial 
government held a news briefing on the province's national 
economic development in 1993. 
  In 1993 Qinghai comprehensively implemented macrocontrol and 
regulatory policies, and as a result it made progress in 
production and construction. Last year the GNP amounted to more 
than 10 billion yuan, an increase of 10.5 percent over the 
previous year. Industrial production showed signs of speedy 
growth and there was a change for the better in output value and 
economic results. Heavy industry grew at a double-digit rate 
and thus stimulated the development of other industries. Large 
and medium-sized industrial enterprises still occupied an 
important position in the province's industrial economy and 
their output value accounted for 66.1 percent of the province's 
gross industrial output value. 
  Last year the province continued to see improvement in the 
position of agriculture as the foundation. Agricultural 
development and construction yielded results. According to 
statistics, last year the total output of grain and oil-bearing 
crops broke previous records. It was the seventh consecutive 
year of increase in grain production and the 10th consecutive 
year of increase in oil-bearing crops production. The scale of 
fixed assets expanded, the increase in productive investment was 
faster than that in nonproductive investment, and investment in 
tertiary industries grew. A number of key projects including 
the Qinghai oil field fulfilled or overfulfilled the annual 
investment plan. 
  Last year transportation improved, postal and 
telecommunications service grew, market sales remained stable, 
local revenues increased, the monetary and credit field saw 
improvement in controlling willful loan releases and arbitrary 
spending, and bank deposits continued to grow, thus ensuring 
funding for key economic construction projects.

  [Text] In 1993, enterprises in the province increased the 
momentum of reform and maintained a stable, sustained, and 
speedy development trend in industrial production. According to 
statistics, industrial enterprises at the township level and 
above throughout the province produced an aggregate industrial 
output value of more than 7 billion yuan, an increase of 13.4 
percent over the previous year. Budgetary industrial 
enterprises throughout the province produced an aggregate 
industrial output value of 3.35 billion yuan, an increase of 
15.8 percent over the previous year; they earned sales income of 
4.6 billion yuan, an increase of 55 percent; and materialized 
285 million yuan of profits and taxes, an increase of 24.47 
percent. 
  Last year relevant departments and enterprises increased the 
momentum of reform and promoted development by means of reform. 
The relevant departments identified more than 500 documents 
which contradicted the Regulations on the Transformation of 
State-Owned Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms, and reduced 
their intervention in enterprises. The province's mandatory 
plans on industrial products were reduced by 53 percent. 
According to new demands and changes, the province selected 16 
enterprises to contract for investment and output, and 25 
enterprises for the trial- implementation of a shareholding 
system or shareholding cooperative system. More than 60 percent 
of small, state-cooperative commercial enterprises exercised 
civilian management under state ownership. Three kinds of 
reforms in enterprises also switched from a single nature to a 
comprehensive one, 40 percent of enterprises introduced an 
all-personnel contract system, 47 enterprises were merged or 
absorbed, and 4 enterprises were closed because they had 
suffered serious losses for long periods. 
  These enterprise reforms helped improve economic returns and 
arrested the decline in their production. By the end of last 
year, the province registered sustained and healthy development 
in heavy industrial production; large-scale increases in the 
electric power, machine building, metallurgical, nonferrous 
metals, and building materials industries; and a turn for the 
better in light industry, which has fluctuated in the last few 
years. Production in the major areas was comparatively balanced.

Zedong's Erudite and Profound Thinking on Army Building] 
  [Text] The publication by the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] Publishing House of the "General Introduction to Mao 
Zedong Thought on Army-Building" (written by Hou Luliang), which 
is a systematic study of Comrade Mao Zedong's glorious thought 
on the building of a People's Army, on the eve of the centenary 
of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth, is very meaningful. 
  Mao Zedong thought on army-building is a key integral part 
of 
Mao Zedong Military Thought and Mao Zedong Thought and the most 
complete and scientific army-building thinking with the most 
Chinese characteristics. Mao Zedong's army-building thought 
reaches deeply into the CPC's great army-building practices; its 
formation and development fully display an ingenuity never seen 
before. We all know that early in the founding period of our 
Army, old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, 
politically disunited, economically underdeveloped, and 
culturally and educationally very backward. Setting up a 
new-type proletariat-led People's Army in such a country was a 
task which had never been addressed by the revolutionary 
teachers Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In the New Democratic 
Revolution period, our Army was far worse off regarding weapons 
and installations than our enemy, with far less troops and much 
worse material conditions. How were we to complete the 
historical tasks of developing our Army into a powerful People's 
Army and toppling the "three great mountains" of imperialism, 
feudalism, and bureaucratism? There were no ready-made answers 
in the Marxist canon. But, in a heaven-shaking style, the 
Chinese Communists opened up the most glorious page of Chinese 
history with superhuman courage and boldness. After the 
founding of New China there were great improvements in the 
objective conditions for army-building. On the other hand, our 
army-building efforts faced many special situations; for 
example, for a very long time imperialism and hegemonism had 
encircled, blockaded, and militarily threatened our country and, 
constrained by the country's economy, there was limited military 
spending, repeated disruptions from "leftist" and rightist 
opportunism, and the sharp contradiction between the Army's low 
levels of modernization and the demands of modern warfare. Mao 
Zedong's army-building thought evolved from such special 
national and military situations and it: Absorbs, but is not 
hamstrung by, foreign experience; is grounded in China's 
practical situation; takes up all the good points of ancient, 
modern, Chinese, and foreign military thought; reveals, in a 
profound way, the basic characteristics and objective laws of 
building a People's Army; and it provides guidelines for the 
People's Army throughout its entire development from nothing 
into a powerful force, during which time miracles were created 
one after another. The road traversed by our Army repeatedly 
proves that when we pursue army-building according to Mao 
Zedong's army-building thought, our army will develop and grow 
and win victories forever; but it will go astray and suffer 
setbacks when we deviate from it. Remembrance of things past 
teaches us to treasure Mao Zedong's army-building thought. 
  Mao Zedong's army-building thought is erudite and profound, 
with rich contents and encompasses all areas and aspects of 
army- building. Its basic tenets and principles apply to the 
past, present, and future. This is because Mao Zedong's 
army-building thought, like Mao Zedong Thought, is the most 
revolutionary and creative, will develop along with changes in 
historical conditions, and always maintains a strong vitality. 
Any sayings or thinking which deprecate the true vale of Mao 
Zedong's army-building thought are untenable. 
  Mao Zedong's army-building thought is the crystal of the 
collective wisdom of Chinese Communists. Comrade Mao Zedong is 
the most distinguished representative of Mao Zedong's 
army-building thought. As the core of our party's leadership 
collective of the second generation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
creatively developed Mao Zedong's army-building thought in the 
new historical era and made brilliant contributions toward 
enriching Marxist army-building theories. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
thought on army-building in the historical era scientifically 
answers a series of important questions about building our Army 
in a new era and points out a direction for our Army's efforts 
to revolutionize, modernize, and regularize itself. His 
advocacy of the guiding principles for strategic changes in 
army-building--the call to: Uphold the principle that 
army-building obeys the country's overall economic construction; 
center on modernization; make a comprehensive effort at building 
a modernized, regular, and revolutionary army; uphold the 
party's absolute leadership over the army; strengthen and 
improve political and ideological work; ensure that our Army is 
politically qualified; put military training in a strategic 
position; work actively to raise officers' ability to cope with 
modern warfare; work actively but steadily, and proceed in an 
orderly and progressive manner while pressing ahead with reforms 
in the Army; insist on ruling the Army with stern measures and 
according to law when the Army must be rectified; develop 
weapons and installations and reform the Army structure and 
size; vigorously strengthen troops' combat power; advocate five 
kinds of revolutionary spirit" and give play to our Army's fine 
traditions; maintain the true color of veteran Red Army 
soldiers; study people's war under modern warfare conditions; 
develop military science; and to grasp the truth that science 
and technology are the primary productive forces--these 
important thoughts and theories of Deng Xiaoping pushed Mao 
Zedong's army-building thought to a new stage. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his report to the 14th 
Party Congress: "It is necessary to act in accordance with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought about army-building in the new 
era; walk the path of turning our soldiers into crack troops 
with Chinese characteristics; build the PLA into a powerful, 
modernized, regular, and revolutionary army; continuously 
strengthen the national defense of our country; and provide a 
solid and powerful security guarantee for reform, opening up, 
and economic construction." This was a call from the Central 
Committee collective leadership, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core, to the whole Army. We must obey the instructions of 
Comrade Jiang Zemin, conscientiously study Mao Zedong's 
army-building thought, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thought on army-building in the new era, to grasp its essence; 
learn to use its position, viewpoints, and methods; emancipate 
minds; seek truth from facts; continuously study new situations 
and solve new problems; and actively work to press ahead with 
the building of our army. I believe that this will be the best 
way to commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. 
  The "General Introduction to Mao Zedong Though on 
Army-Building" tries hard to make an in-depth study of Mao 
Zedong's army-building thought; systematically exposes from, 
different angles, the formation and development of Mao Zedong's 
army-building thought and its basic theoretical viewpoints; and 
touches on the hitherto unexplored areas of Mao Zedong's 
army-building thought, putting forward some new viewpoints and 
understanding. It will help us to understand and 
comprehensively and systematically grasp the entire theoretical 
body of Mao Zedong's army-building thought. The author made a 
great effort in writing the book, though inadequacies still 
remain. It is hoped that in the future there will be continued 
effort to strengthen the study of Mao Zedong's army-building 
thought and further explorations combining theory and practice. 
  At present, our country's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction are in a most critical stage. The People's Army 
shoulders a key historical mission. Led by the party Central 
Committee and Central Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core, we must actively study and use Mao Zedong's 
army- building thought, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thoughts on army-building in the new era; act in accordance with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's general demand of "be qualified 
politically, have a perfect mastery of military affairs, and 
maintain a good style, strict discipline, and effective 
guarantees;" continuously strengthen our Army's comprehensive 
construction and actively raise our army's combat power under 
the condition of modern technology, especially high technology; 
and actively struggle to complete satisfactorily the noble 
mission in the new era given us by the party and people!

  [Text] At the Third Enlarged Session of the Seventh CPC 
Committee of the Hainan Military District on 19 January, Ruan 
Chong, secretary of the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee, 
governor of the province, and first secretary of the Hainan 
Military District CPC Committee, stressed: All levels of party 
committees, governments, and military departments should take 
reform as the driving force, adapt themselves to the development 
of the socialist market economy, and make a success of the work 
concerning the armed forces and militia reserve service, to 
provide a solid safety guarantee for Hainan's development and 
construction. 
  In his speech, Ruan Chongwu referred to Hainan's great 
achievements and progress in 1993. On how to strengthen 
Hainan's reserve forces and its two-support work, he explained 
the following: 
  First, strengthening the reserve forces has been the 
consistent idea of many generations of party leaders. In 
particular, as Hainan is located in the forefront of national 
defense, it is more important to strengthen this work. All 
levels of party committees, governments, and military 
departments should take reform as a driving force, adapt 
themselves to the development of the socialist market economy, 
and make a success of the work concerning the armed forces and 
militia reserve service, to provide a solid safety guarantee for 
Hainan's development and construction. We should continue to 
exercise party leadership over the armed forces. All levels of 
party committees should pay close attention to this and should 
put the improvement of militia reserve service, the people's 
armed forces departments, and military garrisons on their 
agenda. There is a need to put the stress of military reserve 
service on grass-roots-level organizations. Grass-roots-level 
organizations are the foundation of the reserve forces and

  [Text] Last year, military industrial enterprises in the 
province made breakthroughs in switching over from the 
production of military products to civilian products. Output 
value of products for civilian use turned out by all military 
industrial enterprises in the province approached 1.5 billion 
yuan, accounting for 75.2 percent of the total output value of 
these enterprises, or an increase of 12 percent over that of the 
previous year. Output value of products for civilian use turned 
out by aeronautics and astronautics industrial enterprises in 
the province accounted for 97 percent of their total output 
value. This enable these enterprises to change deficits into 
profits. In the transfer process, aeronautics and astronautics 
industrial enterprises took full advantage of their numerous 
talents and technologies to develop products for civilian use 
and readjust their product structure in line with the principles 
of having a high starting point, high standards, high quality, 
and high added value, thus initially giving rise to a number of 
enterprises that combine the production of military products 
with the production of civilian products. Last year, relatively 
good progress was made in the project of producing 70,000 
mini-buses annually by Harbin Airplane Manufacturing Company as 
jointly planned by the province and Harbin city. In the first 
half of this year, various production lines of this company will 
be put sequentially under test operation and production. Thus 
far, civilian products turned out by Harbin Airplane 
Manufacturing Company and (Dongan) Engine Manufacturing Company 
have accounted for 98 percent and 94 percent of their total 
respectively. The follow-up projects transferred to produce 
civilian products have also been linked in a relatively good 
manner. Sixteen projects, including the heavy-duty vehicles for 
desert use, engineering machines, and tank trucks, have been put 
under construction respectively, and some 190 million yuan of 
funds have been put in place. 
  New headway has also been made in popularizing new 
technologies for producing civilian products. Twenty-five new 
civilian products, including the 20-foot container self-loading 
and self-unloading trailer and high-energy igniting coil, passed 
appraisal last year to gain some 20 million yuan in value. Last 
year, military industrial enterprises also positively supported 
the development of tertiary industry and opened their tertiary 
industrial enterprises to the public. Last year, all military 
industrial enterprises in the province built 400 new enterprises 
oriented to developing tertiary industry, and 6,700 workers were 
hired. Most of the guest rooms, hospitals, special railway 
lines, and unused warehouses and plant houses of these 
enterprises have been oriented to the market and been open to 
the public on a paid basis. There has been a good situation of 
equally promoting commerce, service, and communications in the 
military industrial enterprises, and of vigorously developing 
the tertiary industry.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the provincial government and 
provincial military district held a joint meeting on protecting 
military facilities. Liu Guoyu, member of the provincial party 
committee's Standing Committee and commander of the provincial 
military district, attended and addressed the meeting. 
  In his speech, Liu Guoyu said that the protection of 
military 
facilities involves military and civilian interests and requires 
better cooperation on both sides. All kinds of interests should 
be correctly handled. Leading groups in charge of military 
facilities should carry out their responsibility to protect 
military facilities. Regions without these leading groups 
should form such groups as soon as possible according to the 
relevant documents and should maintain relative stability among 
their personnel. Towns, townships, and villages where military 
facilities are situated, as well as enterprises, institutions, 
and mass organizations near military facilities should, 
coordinated by the local People's Armed Forces departments and 
public security departments, form backbone contingents with 
grass-roots-level cadres and militiamen as the main component 
and should mobilize and rely on the masses to form a defense 
network comprising soldiers, policemen, and civilians. They 
should form organizations, work out plans, and frequently 
supervise the implementation of these plans. 
  The relevant military departments and People's Armed Forces 
departments should sign contracts with the protectors on 
protecting military facilities and clarifying their duties and 
responsibilities. Organizations in charge of military 
facilities should take the lead in studying and enforcing the 
law and should, according to legal standards and procedures, 
handle problems arising in the protection of military facilities 
so that the protection of military facilities can be carried out 
under the legal system. 
  Vice Governor Su Xiaoyun presented a written speech to the 
meeting.

during the new period. Through this congress, all levels of 
party organizations, all Communist Party members, all members of 
the Communist Youth League [CYL], and all military officers and 
men in the province should be further mobilized to pioneer the

general demand of being qualified in politics, tough in military 
affairs, fine in tradition, strict in discipline, and effective 
in guaranteeing the rear services, maintain the high degree of 
stability and unity of the Army, strive to improve the region's 
modern fighting capacity, and ensure that the region will 
fulfill the tasks set on it by the CPC Central Committee and the 
Central Military Commission. 
  Song Qingwei pointed out: To fulfilling the goal to be 
attained in the coming five years, the key lies in constantly 
effective leadership of party organizations. Party 
organizations at all levels must strengthen and improve party 
leadership in the practice of building the Army to ensure the 
unity of the Army through powerful and effective leadership. 
  In his report, Song Qingwei called on party organizations at 
all levels, all party members and CYL members, and the vast 
numbers of officers and soldiers to closely rally around the CPC 
Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, work 
hard with one heart and one mind, and be keen in blazing new 
trials in order to score new achievements, create a new 
situation, and make even greater contributions to the reform and 
building of the Army.

  [Text] The reshuffle of the leadership of the seven 
military regions of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has 
continued with the retirement of the political commissar of the 
strategic Nanjing Military Region. 
  The provincial media has reported that Lieutenant-General 
Liu 
Anyuan has been replaced by Major General Fang Zuqi. Military 
sources said yesterday General Liu's retirement was due to age 
and not to factional struggles. 
  General Fang is among a corps of young officers who have 
been 
promoted to the top echelons since the reshuffle began following 
an enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in 
mid-December. His last post was director of the Political 
Department of the Beijing Military Region, a position he 
occupied for less than a year. Responsibilities of the Nanjing 
region include the Taiwan Strait and monitoring Taiwan's 
military strength. 
  In addition to General Fang, two other senior staff of the 
Beijing region, Lieutenant-Generals Li Laizhu and Zhang Zhijian, 
have gained promotions in the last few weeks. 
  Sources close to the PLA said at the enlarged CMC conclave, 
the top brass also discussed military organisation, strategy and 
geopolitics. "The CMC will further streamline the command 
structure by concentrating decision-making powers at the 
headquarters level," an informed source said. The source said 
the CMC was studying a recent suggestion by its think-tanks that 
an organ similar to a Western-style national security council be 
set up. 
  Aside from members of the top brass, such a council, which 
might be attached to the Communist Party's Central Committee, 
would incorporate civilian defence, intelligence and foreign 
affairs experts. In terms of geopolitical strategy, the CMC 
endorsed the shift of emphasis from the north and northeast to 
the south and the east of the country. 
  Western military analysts said following improvement of 
relations with Russia and other members of the former Soviet 
Union, the focus of Chinese defence and power projections had 
moved to the southeastern fringe. They said the majority of the 
large-scale war games held by the PLA last year had taken place 
along the south and eastern coasts. 
  The analysts said as a result of this new strategy, 
expansion 
of naval capacity continued to be a top priority with the 
national armaments modernisation programme. However, Chinese 
sources said both the CMC and the central Government had decided 
to tone down media coverage of the expansion of the Chinese 
Navy. The main reason was Beijing's desire to remove the 
suspicion and anxiety of its Asian neighbours.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Open Up New Prospects for Greater Flourishing </F>
of Military Literature and Art"] 
  [Text] As the new year started, the Army-Wide Literary and 
Art Work Conference, which was approved by the Central Military 
Commission [CMC], successfully concluded. At the conference, 
the leaders in charge of literary and artistic work, persons in 
charge of literary and art departments, and old and new writers 
and artists were gathered together and conscientiously studied 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art and 
Chairman Jiang's important instructions on Army literary and art 
work. They discussed how to make Army literary and art work 
flourish, obtained a clearer understanding of the situation, 
confirmed the orientation, specified the tasks, and boosted 
confidence. CMC Chairman Jiang, Vice Chairman Zhang, and other 
leading comrades had a cordial meeting with the deputies to the 
conference. Chairman Jiang gave an important instruction, which 
was the greatest encouragement and spur for the literary and art 
workers Army-wide. 
  In pace with the reform and opening up and the vigorous 
strides of the overall building of the Army in the new era, 
gratifying achievements have been made in the Army's literary 
and art work. Many excellent works that are ideologically sound, 
refined in taste, and artistically valuable have been created in 
literature, dramas, films, television programs, songs, dances, 
acrobatics, quyi [collective term for folk art forms including 
ballad singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, 
and cross talks], and fine arts. They have exerted an extensive 
influence in and outside the Army and on cultural exchanges with 
other countries. The old, middle-aged, and young literary and 
art workers helped each other make progress and a batch of 
outstanding, young, and talented people have shown themselves, 
reinforcing the contingent of writers and artists. The broad 
ranks of literary and art workers went to the grass-roots levels 
with full enthusiasm. They created works and gave performances 
for soldiers and were accorded warm welcome. The cultural 
facilities at the grass-roots levels have been constantly 
improved and the cultural life at the company level has been 
enhanced. The CPC Central Committee and the CMC have paid close 
attention to, and been very concerned with, the Army literary 
and art work. Recently, Chairman Jiang pointed out: "In 
strengthening the Army's building of spiritual civilization, it 
is imperative to make energetic efforts to advocate healthy, 
uplifting, inspiring, and colorful cultural life in the 
barracks." The Army literary and art workers should "take pains 
to sing the praises of the new people, new things, and new 
habits in the Army; provide them with more spiritual food that 
is both educational and well accepted by the broad ranks of 
officers and men; and make new contributions to the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization and enhancement of the Army's 
fighting capabilities." "Our army should play a better role as 
pacesetter in the building of spiritual civilization and move 
ahead in the forefront of the society." To this end, the Army 
literature and art must conform to the circumstances and 
development, as well as the ever-rising demand of the broad 
ranks of officers and men on their cultural life, and develop 
and flourish to a greater extent. This is the expectation of 
the party and the people and the call of our times and history. 
  In making Army literature and art flourish, the most 
important link is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on 
literature and art as the fundamental model. Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking on literature and art is an important component of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It 
is very rich in content and is highly creative and practical. 
On the basis of inheriting and developing Mao Zedong's thinking 
on literature and art, it scientifically sums up the experience 
of our party in guiding the literary and art work in the past 
decades. It is a concrete embodiment of the party's basic line 
in the literary and artistic sector, it clearly points out the 
direction for the development of socialist literary and art 
undertakings in the new historical period, it answers the many 
new questions facing the literary and art work in the new era, 
and it is the very basis on which we can do a good job in the 
Army's literary and art work. We should unify our thinking, 
equip ourselves mentally, and guide our practice with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art so that we can 
grasp better the laws and trends of the Army literature and art 
in the new historical context and enable the Army literature and 
art to develop and flourish in the correct direction. 
  Encouraging the main theme is required of Army literature 
and 
art in our times and an important premise and basic orientation 
of the Army literature and art for making the reinvigoration 
possible. In this great epoch we are in now, the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, the 
glorious practice and creative spirit of the masses in the 
reform, opening up, and modernization, and the traditional 
virtues of the Chinese nation constitute the main theme that 
promotes social development and the progress of our nation. Our 
literary and artistic creation and performance should accurately 
grasp today's spirit, profoundly reflect the nature and 
mainstream of the real life, and sing praises of the excellent 
quality and brilliant achievements that the soldiers and 
civilians of our country have displayed in the great cause. In 
the meantime, we should strive to improve artistic quality and, 
through lifelike, vivid, and moving artistic images and 
different styles of expression, impart not only a powerful 
ideological persuasiveness, but also a strong artistic appeal to 
the works that encourage the main theme, so as to arouse the 
enthusiasm and creativity of the broad ranks of cadres and men 
in making a good job of Army building and reform. 
  In promoting the development and flourishing of Army 
literature and art, it is necessary to put the focus on the 
creation and performance of works on military topics. The 
dignity of the country, the soul of the nation, and the spirit 
of the people are often more clearly manifested in the Army. 
The works on military topics have a special educational, 
encouraging, and spurring effect. Army writers and artists 
should explore this field of topics in great depth, draw 
artistic inspiration from deep within the history of the 
revolutionary wars and the fiery struggles in reality, 
emancipate the mind, make bold explorations, and make continuous 
innovations, express their deep insight and penetrating 
judgments on history, society, and life from various aspects, 
levels, and perspectives, create the images of today's soldiers 
with distinct characteristics of the times, and help the 
creation and performance of works on military topics to flourish. 
  To make Army literature and art flourish, it is imperative 
to 
build a contingent of writers and artists who are ideologically 
and politically sound and have high professional quality. The 
contingent of writers and artists in the Army has a glorious 
revolutionary tradition and enjoys a high reputation among the 
general public. In the new historical context, it is necessary 
to keep strengthening the building of professional ethics, 
conscientiously resist the influence of money worship, 
out-and-out individualism, and decadent life-style, establish a 
correct outlook on life and values, work diligently, quietly 
dedicate oneself, and make oneself worthy of the title of 
engineer of the soul. They should constantly temper themselves 
and improve their artistic and cultural understanding, 
consistently go into life and maintain a flesh-and-blood 
relationship with the masses and the broad ranks of officers and 
men, so as to absorb strength from them extensively and inspire 
their own creativity. The leaders at various levels should show 
concern and care for literary and artistic workers in political 
terms, in ideology, in professional activities, and in daily 
life, and give maximum play to their wisdom and artistic 
talents, so that the contingent of writers and artists in our 
Army will always maintain a vibrant life force and vigorous 
vitality. 
  The ultimate objective for making Army literature and art 
flourish is to bring up a generation of revolutionary soldiers 
"with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of 
discipline," to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, and to enhance the Army's fighting capabilities. 
Therefore, we should not only build well the professional 
contingent of writers and artists, but also pay close attention 
to the guidance for the mass cultural and entertainment 
activities in the barracks. While holding fast to high standards 
and cultured taste, it is imperative to ensure the regularity 
and institutionalization of the spare-time cultural activities 
of the troops, conduct such activities as watching movies and 
television, entertainment, reading, and sports extensively, and 
make the cultural life in barracks colorful, down-to-earth, and 
effective. 
  The CPC Central Committee and the CMC set great store by the 
flourishing of Army literature and art. The broad ranks of 
officers and men and the masses place high hopes on the Army 
writers and artists. The cause is a glorious one, whereas the 
task is heavy and the road is long. Let us unite as one, forge 
ahead with a trailblazing spirit, and open up a new prospect of 
greater flourishing in the army literature and art with creative 
work and rich fruits.

said yesterday. 
  In the next few years most of the firms set up by CAS will 
be 
restructured into share-holding limited companies. 
  Zhou told the academy's annual conference that it was time 
to 
fully abandon the old model of the central planned economy. 
  "We should change our structure into a more open and active 
one that is closely related with the country's economy," he said. 
  Zhou said the "strategic structural adjustment" proposed for 
the academy would make the most of its tight budget. 
  But it would mean some casualties. 
  The president said researchers who used to rely on 
government 
funding would face the unknown--unemployment or the marketplace. 
  "Even though the reform might hurt some, it is an inevitable 
historical trend and will not follow some people's intention. 
Only if we keep up with the trend can we greatly reduce the 
temporary pain." 
  CAS will concentrate funding and personnel on training and 
commercially oriented research--including a project to train and 
select people who will lead research into the 21st century as 
part of its scientific training programme. 
  And in a move away from the large scale scientific building 
projects of the past, Zhou focussed on the economic development 
campaigns planned by CAS--efficient use of coal, treatment of 
South China's red soil, development of the rare-earth industry 
and information technology. 
  The academy will also establish two modern comprehensive 
science research centres this year: the Shanghai Life Science 
Research Centre and the Modern Earth Science Research Centre. 
  "CAS will also select some major topics in mathematics and 
in 
nonlinear, environmental, material and information science," the 
president said. 
  Zhou stated the three strategic missions of 
CAS--establishing 
a world class base for scientific research, nurturing a group of 
talented Chinese scientists and supporting the country's 
economic development and hi-tech industry. 
  "The goal is to build CAS into a lively institution with an 
academic department made up of the country's top scientists," 
Zhou said.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254): "Nurture </F>
Cross-Century Academic and Technical Leaders"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed "nurturing a 
team of academic and technical leaders who will be in the 
vanguard of scientific and technological development in the 
coming century." This work is of strategic significance. 
  The cross-century science and technology leaders must have a 
reserve force. In undertaking socialist modernization, it is 
imperative to train and select young scientists and technicians. 
Since the founding of New China, our country has trained and 
nurtured a contingent of scientists and technicians of a 
considerable skill level, and of all branches of the sciences 
and specialties. The contingent consists of nearly 25 million 
people of whom 17 million are natural science and technology 
personnel. They have played an important role in promoting 
scientific and technological progress, and economic development 
in our country. 
  However, this is far from sufficient to meet our needs. Our 
country has a large population, and the 17 million scientific 
and technological personnel account for only 1.4 percent of the 
population. In the late 1980's, such a percentage was way below 
that of both developed and less developed countries. In the 
meantime, we have been unable to keep up with increasing needs 
with respect to quality, overall distribution, structural 
composition, and rational use of manpower. A serious aging 
problem exists among specialized advanced technology personnel, 
particularly among academic and technical leaders. 
  In order to accelerate the training of young, specialized 
technological personnel, in 1991 the General Office of the State 
Council transmitted a document of the Ministry of Personnel -- 
"Opinions on How To Strengthen the Contingent of Specialized and 
Technological Personnel, and Promote the Growth of Outstanding 
Middle-Aged and Young Specialized and Technological Personnel"-- 
to the lower levels. Some localities and departments have since 
successively promulgated the relevant policies. The State 
Education Commission put forward a plan for nurturing 
outstanding cross-century young talent; the Academy of Sciences 
has set up a young scientist award; the State Natural Science 
Foundation has established a special fund for outstanding 
middle-aged and young people; Shanghai has been implementing a 
young specialized personnel training plan; and Tianjin has 
formulated a plan for building an echelon of cross-century 
science and technology leaders. 
  However, these actions are far from sufficient to keep up 
with the rapid development of the economy, and science and 
technology at present. Recently, the Experts Department of the 
Ministry of Personnel held a symposium in Tianjin to explore the 
concept of and measures for nurturing cross-century academic and 
technical leaders. Those present pointed out: At present, we 
should further enhance our understanding of the importance and 
urgency of nurturing academic and technical leaders, as well as 
our sense of responsibility; and regard the task as a top 
priority in strengthening the contingent of specialized and 
technological personnel. 
  It has been reported that the Ministry of Personnel, working 
in conjunction with other departments and various provinces and 
municipalities concerned, is formulating concrete measures for 
nurturing cross-century academic and technical leaders. We are 
convinced that so long as policies are appropriate and measures 
are effective, it is certain that outstanding young specialized 
and technological personnel will constantly emerge, and the 
overall skill level of our scientific and technological force 
will certainly be raised.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- China's third-generation 
robots, which possess technology which is on a par with the 
world's best, have replaced manual operations in some production 
procedures which are harmful and too strenuous for human beings. 
This shows that this is the end of the stage in which robots 
were only samples and exhibits for demonstrative purposes. 
  China started robotic research during the Sixth Five-Year 
Plan period, and robotic technology has eventually become 
applicable after nearly two generations of research, 
manufacturing, and development. The China National Astronautics 
Company, China's first unit engaged in developing robots, has 
now developed nine types of robots, including robots capable of 
carrying out arc and spot welding, painting, handling equipment 
for general use, assembling items, and moving; robots for 
teaching and scientific research; and robots for disposing of 
toxic materials and explosives. The robots developed by the 
company are among the best in the country in terms of their 
variety, capabilities, quality, and reliability; and the 
controlling technology, which has been described as the robots' 
brain, is among the best in the world. This reporter saw that a 
robot built to arc and spot weld had the intelligence to repeat 
instructions, meaning that after it was instructed once, it 
could accurately and flawlessly repeat the motions it had been 
taught. A painting robot -- which could dexterously move its 
waist, arms, and wrists, hold a 10-kg tool, and repeatedly 
reposition itself with a precision of less than 2 mm -- has been 
designated by the state as a major technology to be popularized 
in the country. Robots designed to assemble electronics 
components have visual distinguishing functions, and they can 
grip specific components for precision assembly and reposition 
themselves with a precision of less than 0.03 mm. These robots, 
which can be used to assemble household appliances, calculators, 
automobiles, cameras, wristwatches, and so on, have been in use 
at the Shanghai Instrument and Meter Plant for assembling 
electronics components. Robots for arc and spot welding and 
painting are being produced in small quantities, and these 
robots are being used to weld and paint Audi automobiles at the 
No. One Motor Plant as well as Tongfeng trucks at the No. Two 
Motor Plant. This has substantially increased production 
automation and management. 
  It has been learned that robots capable of building pier 
buttresses [ma duo 4316 1000], packaging, climbing walls, 
walking upright, and controlling reconnaissance drones are being 
developed.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- To enhance management 
over ground reception equipment for satellite television 
transmission, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
[SAIC] recently formulated provisions on relevant issues 
regarding the sale of satellite ground reception equipment. The 
provisions are as follows: 
  1. The registered capital of units engaging in the sale of 
satellite ground reception equipment must not be below one 
million yuan. They must have the capability to provide 
after-sales services for satellite ground reception equipment, 
and have no fewer than three specialized personnel with the 
capability to install, tune, test, repair, and provide 
maintenance. 
  2. Provincial-level industry and commerce administration 
organs, together with the same level of domestic trade, radio 
broadcasting and television, and electronic industry 
administration departments, shall designate sale units of the 
satellite ground reception equipment and report the unit 
designation to the SAIC for the record. The SAIC shall, 
together with the State Council's domestic trade, radio 
broadcasting and television, and electronic industry 
administration departments, designate units that register with 
the SAIC. Provincial-level industry and commerce administration 
bureaus and the SAIC shall respectively publicize the designated 
sale units. Undesignated units and individuals are forbidden to 
conduct the sale of satellite ground reception equipment. 
  3. Industry and commerce administration organs must 
strengthen management over sale units of satellite ground 
reception equipment. Prefecture and city-level industry and 
commerce administration organs should, under the unified 
organization of provincial-level industry and commerce 
administration organs, carry out checks once a year on sale 
units' operation of satellite ground reception equipment. 
Provincial-level organs shall report the results to the SAIC. 
The SAIC shall conduct unscheduled spot checks of sale units. 
  4. Sale units shall only sell satellite ground reception 
equipment to those units and individuals who can produce 
purchase certificates issued by radio broadcasting and 
television administration departments, and to those units whose 
names are listed as state designated sale units. Sale units 
shall only sell equipment that is produced by enterprises 
designated by the state; they shall only sell imported satellite 
equipment approved by the state. They are forbidden to sell 
smuggled, counterfeit, inferior- quality satellite ground 
reception equipment or equipment produced by enterprises that 
are not designated by the state. They are forbidden to sell 
products not authenticated by the State Council Product Quality 
Supervision and Management Department, or by 
quality-authentication organs authorized by it. They are 
forbidden to sell satellite ground reception equipment without a 
quality-authentication certificate, and products without the 
seal of quality-authentification. 
  5. Those who engage in the sale of satellite ground 
reception 
equipment in violation of the provisions shall be ordered by 
industry and commerce administration departments to cease. The 
departments shall confiscate their equipment and impose a fine 
that is equivalent to two times below the sale amount. Units 
designated by industry and commerce administration departments 
shall either dispose of or auction off the confiscated 
equipment; the proceeds of the sale will be delivered to the 
state treasury.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769): "China's </F>
Choice in Environmental Protection in 1993"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jan (XINHUA) -- 1. China's 
Environmental Protection Achievements Attract Worldwide 
Attention 
  China's economy has entered another period of rapid 
development in the 1990's. 
  Economic development, population growth, and higher 
consumption levels mean our country faces the threat of a global 
environmental problem. Moreover, with the increased degree of 
development and urbanization, as well as the development of 
village and town enterprises, environmental pollution and 
ecological damage accompanying our economic development have 
increasingly become an important factor actually obstructing our 
economic and social development. 
  In 1993, the World Environmental Day meeting and award 
ceremony for the world's "top 500" were held in Beijing. The 
event attracted worldwide attention for China's environmental 
protection. 
  In environmental protection, China has always been in the 
front ranks of developing countries. 
  Many of our achievements have gone down in the history of 
civilization: 
  -- Ecological agriculture has spread across the country, 
with 
the establishment of several thousand ecological agriculture 
experimental units of various types and size. As early as the 
beginning of the 1980's, China stopped the production of 
insecticides with strong poisons and high residue. The 
agricultural department began experimenting on pollution-free 
production and made new progress in afforestation on plains and 
along coastal regions. In particular, the shelter-forest project 
in the northeast-north-northwest region is known as "the world's 
best ecological project." 
  -- Success has been achieved in preventing industrial 
pollution. A large number of industrial pollution control 
facilities built in our country in the 1980's have successively 
yielded results, raising the rate of disposal of three wastes 
[waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue], as well as the 
up-to-standard rate, remarkably. 
  -- China's urban environmental situation has improved 
remarkably. As a result of the comprehensive efforts to improve 
the environment, the environmental quality of many cities has 
become better to varying degrees. Despite large increases in 
the urban population and energy consumption, urban atmospheric 
conditions have basically not worsened and the amount of some 
pollutants in the atmosphere have even decreased, thanks to 
various urban air pollution control measures. 
  China's environmental protection has unique features, which 
have attracted the attention of the Third World. 
<H3>  2. Our Country Still Faces Grim Environmental Protection 
Prospects At a Time of Rapid Economic Development </H3>
  According to relevant departments, our country should 
soberly 
assess its current status of environment protection, despite its 
tremendous achievements in preventing and controlling industrial 
pollution. In the past year, some newly-launched projects, 
especially "wholly or partly foreign-owned" construction 
projects in development zones, continued to develop new 
pollution sources because they failed to strictly implement 
relevant state regulations mandating environmental impact 
assessments, and the "simultaneous construction of projects and 
facilities to control three wastes." Pollution in village and 
town enterprises worsened with each passing day, and the general 
level of industrial pollution increased. 
  In 1992, 36.6 billion metric tons of waste water was 
released 
across the country, up nine percent from 1991; this figure does 
not cover village and town enterprises. The amount of waste 
water released last year was significantly higher than that 
discharged in the preceding year. Although the water quality in 
the main course of the Chang Jiang is good, pollution is quite 
serious near the river banks in sections that run through the 
major cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Only 
41 percent of the 38,000-km stretches of the seven major rivers 
and inland rivers subject to water quality tests measure up to 
first- and second-class water quality standards, whereas 48 
percent indicate fairly serious pollution. Surface water 
pollution is serious in the cities, with the river stretches in 
80 percent of the cities suffering varying degrees of pollution. 
Statistics on 67 cities show that the annual and daily average 
levels of suspended atmospheric particles in approximately half 
of those cities exceed the limits. The annual and daily average 
levels of sulfur dioxide in 13 cities exceed secondary state 
limits. 
  Our country's ecological problems also cannot be neglected. 
  The devastating sandstorm that erupted in the northwest on 5 
May 1993 left 85 people dead and 31 missing. Once again, we 
were given a warning of ecological destruction. 
  The entire country is suffering from grassland degradation, 
desertification, salinization, and alkalinization. The illegal 
occupation and utilization of farmland has yet to be completely 
halted. 
  Soil erosion is serious. A recent survey shows that 1.93 
million square km [sq km] and 1.88 million sq km of land is 
affected by water and wind erosion, respectively. A sandstorm 
danger line totaling 10,000 li has been formed in northwest, 
north, and northeast China. Approximately one-third of the 
country's land is threatened by sandstorms, and more than 60 
percent of impoverished counties in our country are concentrated 
within this line. Economic losses from sandstorms reach 4.5 
billion yuan annually. 
<H3>  3. The Entire Country Was Buffeted by the Environmental 
Protection Wave in 1993 </H3>
  Last spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
decided to create an Environmental Protection Committee. Never 
before had our country set up environmental protection 
committees under both the government and the NPC. 
  On 27 May, the State Environmental Protection Bureau 
released 
the names of 3,000 key pollution-causing enterprises in an 
attempt to encourage enterprises to control pollution. Unlike 
in the past when enterprises were allocated "spots" in order of 
their output value, profits, and taxes, they were listed 
according to the amount of effluents. Some of the large and 
medium enterprises which had previously been considered 
"efficient" were on the list. The move caused quite a stir 
throughout the country. 
  In 1993, work to set up environmental indices was carried 
out gradually across the country. The establishment of an 
environmental index system is an environmental protection 
measure that is suited to the socialist market economy. 
Completely banning the movement of rhinoceros horns and tiger 
bone -- including medicines and handicrafts made of relevant 
materials -- into and out of the country is an important measure 
taken by our country to honor international conventions and to 
protect wildlife; the same can be said of completely banning the 
sale, purchase, carrying, and mailing of such products. At a 
national conference on industrial pollution prevention and 
control in Shanghai in October, Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the 
State Council, stated: Environmental protection has strong 
technical, economic, and legal implications. As in quality 
control work, we should heighten the environmental awareness of 
all people. It is wrong to think that pollution control can be 
spared to save money and accelerate industrial development. If 
we fail to control pollution, we will end up spending more money 
and will be unable to recoup losses that we have incurred. He 
stressed the need to combine environmental protection with 
comprehensive utilization, to protect and make full use of 
national resources, to generate economic returns, and to clean 
up the environment. 
  The general inspection of the nationwide enforcement of 
environmental protection laws organized by the Environmental 
Protection Committees under the NPC and the State Council, as 
well as activities launched in October in connection with 
China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century, have 
had an extensive impact on all localities across the country. 
  The high-standard and large-scale inspection of 
environmental 
protection law enforcement, which was launched for the first 
time since our country began its environmental protection 
program 20 years ago, has focused on seven provinces and 
autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guangdong, 
Anhui, and Jiangsu. It also covers 43 cities and counties and 
166 factories in those provinces and autonomous regions. A 
number of cases involving environmental law violations and 
wildlife destruction have been investigated and dealt with. An 
example is the destruction of resources and the environment as a 
result of the illegal sale of rhinoceros horns in Wuchuan 
County, Guangdong Province; the extraction of gall secretion 
from live bears on the Zhuhai Bear Farm; the illegal 
construction of a seriously polluting cement plant in the Shilin 
tourist spot by the Jianan Company in Lunan County, Yunnan 
Province; and illegal gold mining in the Altun Mountain Nature 
Reserve. Besides citing negative examples for educational 
purposes, the state has issued a circular to commend a large 
number of advanced environmental protection models and 
instances. This has led to the enactment of local environmental 
protection laws and heightened the environmental protection 
awareness of local cadres and people. In Shandong, Governor 
Zhao Zhihao has urged leading cadres at all levels to "become 
accomplished individuals instead of a culpable generation" in 
environmental protection work. 
  "China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century," 
attended by as many as 100 reporters from scores of news 
organizations, has had a great impact nationwide. For 20 days 
in a row, the China Central Television Station, during its 
National News Hookup program, broadcast reports on environmental 
protection from various areas, an unprecedented event since the 
founding of our country's television station. Many of the 
problems reflected during "China's March Toward An Environmental 
Protection Century" have attracted the attention of leaders at 
all levels, who have taken action to solve them. For instance, 
the report on environmental pollution and ecological destruction 
as a consequence of energy development in areas linking Shanxi, 
Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia has attracted the attention of State 
Council leaders. In mid-December, the State Council's 
Environmental Protection Committee held an on-site inspection 
and work meeting to solve the pollution problems of the "Black 
Triangle" of energy. 
  Mankind is marching toward the 21st century. 
  China's environmental protection is also marching toward the 
21st century. 
  China's environmental and development goals are magnificent. 
China is capable of seeking the ultimate solution to its 
environmental problems while maintaining sustained economic 
development.

<F P=106> [By Tsang Yok-Sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for </F>
the Betterment of Hong Kong; from the "Comment" page: "One-Man 
Show Dodges the Truth"] 
  [Text] During the 2 and 1/2-hour "inquiry" of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee (FAC) meeting last week, Mr Michael Sze spoke 
only twice, each time with an opening apology that he had only 
one point to add to his superior's enunciation. When he opened 
his mouth the second time, the "only point" he had to add was: 
"The fact that we are here answering your questions speaks 
volumes." He said it twice in his succinct little speech of no 
more than a few sentences. 
  The session spoke volumes, indeed, about the way the Hong 
Kong Governor is accountable to the British Parliament. In 
answering questions he must have been asked dozens of times 
before, the Governor made his case uncontested, ridiculing at 
will all those who had disagreed with him but were not present 
to defend themselves. Governor Patten quoted Sir David 
Akers-Jones as saying that the Chinese style was not to rig 
elections, but to know the results before they were held. The 
room erupted in laughter. No one bothered to question the 
accuracy of the quote. 
  The Governor described statements from Chinese officials as 
"irrational", "largely rhetorical" and "devoid of argument". 
The FAC took him at his word. 
  Mr Patten stressed that there were "obviously some limits" 
to 
what he could say at the moment about the Sino-British election 
talks, then safely went on to blame the intransigence and 
perfidy of the Chinese side for the breakdown of the talks. 
  In some questions Mr Patten even managed to display his 
magnanimity. He was asked to comment on the speculation that 
China was "pouring money into a political party called DAB 
[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]", to which 
he answered: "I do not know where (the DAB's) funds come from." 
He was invited to give an opinion on China's "so-called 
advisers", and he generously said it would help Hong Kong if 
those advisers gave good advice to China, hastily adding: "I am 
not sure that the advice is always as good and sound as one 
might like." 
  The main thrust of Mr Patten's argument was that the 
Sino-British dispute could not be resolved because China did not 
want to see fair elections in Hong Kong. "What is at issue is 
whether (the 1994/95 electoral) arrangements are fair or 
unfair," he said. "That is the nub of the argument." 
  He told the committee that the Chinese wanted "rotten" 
electoral arrangements. As an example he pointed to the 
geographical constituencies: "If it is the case that Chinese 
officials are arguing in geographical constituencies, for 
example, for double- member constituencies with everybody having 
one vote, thus ensuring that you would get a very different 
result in geographical constituencies from the one that was 
obtained last time; if that is what Chinese officials are 
arguing for, and if Chinese officials will not give up on that, 
does one just surrender the point? Does one put in place 
electoral arrangements which secure halving the number of 
pro-democracy politicians that can be elected through 
geographical constituencies?" 
  A very interesting piece of logic. Let us put aside the 
obvious question of how a double-seat single-vote system, and 
for that matter any electoral system based on universal 
franchise, could selectively penalise a particular category of 
politicians. Why would "a very different result...from the one 
that was obtained last time" be unacceptable to Mr Patten? Does 
he already have a preconception about how many of those whom he 
calls "pro-democracy politicians" should be elected? So who is 
talking about knowing the result before the elections now? In 
his eagerness to expose the rottenness of the Chinese side. Mr 
Patten ran into yet another self contradiction. If, as he 
claimed, the British and the Chinese sides were each insisting 
on a different electoral system for the Legco [Legislative 
Council] geographical constituencies in 1995. How could the 
British call it a "non-contentious" issue, and blame the Chinese 
for refusing to include it in a first-stage agreement? These 
inconsistencies, and many others, stood out blatantly in Mr 
Patten's allegations. The FAC overlooked them all, deliberately 
or otherwise. The local English press called it a "grilling". 
It was more like Chris Patten's one-man show. As such it was 
painstakingly planned and superbly performed, one must admit, 
realising there was never any intention to seek truth from facts.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zheng Guoxiong Says Only When the British Side </F>
Withdraws Patten's Proposal Can China and Britain Resume Talks"] 
  [Text] In response to the recent British statements 
calling for continued talks with the Chinese side, Zheng 
Guoxing, deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of XINHUA, 
pointed out yesterday that Chris Patten's recent performances in 
London, as well as the results of the British Cabinet meeting, 
did not carry new meaning and that the Sino-British talks had 
been totally disrupted by the British side. Only when the 
British side displays sincerity by practical action and 
withdraws the partial constitutional reform bill which had been 
submitted to the Legislative Council [Legco], will it be 
possible for China and Britain to resume talks on the 
arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong through 
diplomatic consultations. 
  Zheng made the aforesaid remarks when attending a public 
occasion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong yesterday 
morning. He pointed out: The fact that the British side has 
submitted the partial constitutional reform bill to Legco means 
that the talks have broken down and that the basis for 
Sino-British cooperation has been disrupted by the British side. 
  The British side should clearly understand the Chinese 
side's 
stand, that only by withdrawing the partial constitutional 
reform bill submitted to Legco can the British side prove its 
sincerity. If the British side is really sincere about the 
talks, they are clear about what to do. 
  Zheng said: The Sino-British talks have broken down because 
the British side unilaterally announced the suspension of 
negotiations at the 17th round of the talks and later submitted 
the partial constitutional reform bill to Legco. Given that the 
British side has gone farther on the road of noncooperation and 
has seriously affected the stable transition of Hong Kong, the 
Chinese side must speed up the work of the Preliminary Work 
Committee and rely on Hong Kong residents in making good 
preparations in all fields in line with the provisions of the 
Basic Law in order to achieve a stable transition. 
  Zheng also pointed out: Given that no agreement is reached 
between China and Britain, the three-tier councils of the 
British Hong Kong Government will only serve until 30 June 1997. 
The future special administration region government will 
reorganize Hong Kong's three-tier councils according to the 
Basic Law. 
  A reporter asked: "Recently the Hong Kong Government again 
applied to Legco for an appropriation of 4.6 billion Hong Kong 
dollars for the airport project. What is your view on this?" 
  Zheng said: "The British move is out of keeping with the 
memorandum of understanding [MOU]. In fact, no sooner had the 
memorandum been signed than the British side put forward a 
financial arrangement in violation of the memorandum. It was 
stipulated in the MOU that debts should not exceed HK$5 billion, 
but the British side put forward a financial arrangement that 
incurred well over HK$5 billion in debt. This means that the 
future special administrative region government should assume a 
heavy debt. As this will directly affect the interests and life 
quality of the vast numbers of Hong Kong residents, it is 
naturally unacceptable to us. Recently the Chinese side put 
forward some proposals, but the British side has made no 
response. The British side is now adopting an attitude of 
ignoring the Chinese side's view and is submitting the airport 
project to Legco piecemeal. This is also unacceptable to us for 
it is not conducive to the solution of the issue on airport 
financial arrangements. The key to solving the airport issue 
lies in the British Hong Kong authorities truly acting according 
to the MOU on the airport project. This is not something 
difficult to solve."

<F P=106> [By Duo Duo (1122 1122): "Lu Ping Says Chris Patten Is in </F>
Doomsday Mood"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen 21 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Lu Ping, 
director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, who is holding a meeting here accepted a special 
interview with this agency's reporter this afternoon, and 
ridiculed the series of recent performances by Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten, saying this was an expression of his 
doomsday mood. 
  Using an analogy which Hong Kong residents are familiar 
with, 
namely, the operational methods of a company boss dealing with 
Chris Patten, Lu Ping said that a boss who knew perfectly well 
that his company was to change hands in less than three years 
from today, but who was bent on making personnel arrangements 
for three years hence or even 30 years without consulting the 
new boss, was this not a joke? Of course, the new boss might 
refuse to accept this when he took over the company. 
  Lu Ping indicated that Chris Patten knows perfectly well 
that 
there are only three years left of British rule in Hong Kong, 
but he wants to make arrangements for the Legislative Council 
and its major officials for three years later. In actual fact, 
he is attempting to make arrangements for their agents, so that 
their spirits would be left behind to continue to affect Hong 
Kong when they eventually leave the territory. 
  Regarding Chris Patten's arguments in his speech delivered 
at 
the British Foreign Affairs Committee that the British Hong Kong 
Government wants to put glass in the windows, whereas the 
Chinese side wants to smash them, Lu Ping said that Chris Patten 
wanted to arbitrarily fix English-style stained glass in the 
windows without first asking the landlord's permission in an 
attempt to prevent the sun's rays from entering the house. That 
being the case, it was precisely Chris Patten who must make a 
clean breast of his ultimate motives to the world. After three 
years, when the landlord recovers the house, of course he had 
the right to remove those window panes and let the sun's rays 
shine all over Hong Kong. Here, the question of whether or not 
we have courage to do that does not exist. 
  On Hong Kong's politics and economy, Lu Ping reiterated that 
the Chinese Government has all along advocated the separation of 
politics and the economy. Reviewing the talks on Hong Kong's 
constitutional reforms, he said that the Chinese side had 
already made very great concessions economically. As for the 
new airport, Lu Ping stated that the responsibility did not rest 
with the Chinese side. He said that there were two principles 
in the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's New Airport: 
First, low costs and high economic returns, without creating 
difficulties for the future special administrative region [SAR] 
government; and second, a minimum of HK$25 billion [Hong Kong 
dollars] in financial reserves should be left to the SAR 
government, and debt left to the SAR government should not 
exceed HK$5 billion. At the same time, the Chinese side had 
expressed where it stood, namely, they supported building a new 
airport. So long as the airport was built on the basis of the 
Memorandum, there was nothing left for the Chinese and British 
side to say. 
  Lu Ping described the British Hong Kong Government's policy 
on the airport issue as being the creation of side issues; now 
the debt left to the future SAR government would far exceed HK$5 
billion, even exceeding the financial reserves of the SAR 
government. How could it deny that a financial burden would be 
left to the SAR government? 
  Lu Ping believes that we do not wrong the British side by 
saying that it has violated the Memorandum of Understanding; it 
was also very clear on which side the responsibility lay 
regarding delays in the airport project. 
  Lu Ping criticized Hamish Macleod's recent remarks that 
China 
had tried to use the airport projects to put pressure on the 
constitutional reform talks, indicating that the Chinese 
Government had never had such thinking. What was Mr. Hamish 
Macleod really after? It made people doubt whether the British 
side really wanted to talk. Therefore, it could be seen that 
those people who harped on the same old tune about the Chinese 
side wanting to link politics to the economy were precisely the 
group who want to turn the airport issue into a political one. 
  Lu Ping said that the Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Pereparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR sincerely hoped that 
the British Hong Kong Government would send men to explain 
matters concerning the airport authority, proceeding from an 
active angle to promote a solution to the airport issue at the 
earliest possible date. Such sincerity could be found in the 
letter the leaders of the two economic ad hoc groups of the 
Preliminary Working Committee had addressed to Anson Chan Fang 
On-sang. However, the British side had flatly turned down this 
suggestion, whereas Anson Chan Fang On- sang had failed to reply 
to the letter in question up to this moment. Once again, 
politics and the economy were being linked. 
  Recalling the fact that during the Sino-British talks over 
the constitutional reform issue, the Chinese side had agreed to 
the Central reclamation project, Lu Ping stated: We could have 
procrastinated, but why should we have given our consent? This 
is evidence to the fact that we do not link politics to the 
economy. 
  Lu Ping said: We do not hope that the Sino-British political 
differences will affect Sino-British economic ties, but should 
the British side insist on linking politics to the economy, thus 
affecting Sino-British economic relations and Hong Kong's 
economy, the responsibility does not rest with the Chinese side. 
  Lu Ping said frankly that the crux lay in the fact that 
there 
should be some common aspirations and an atmosphere of 
cooperation between the two sides. Only then, could a major 
issue become a minor one; otherwise, a tiny issue can change 
into a major one, and a simple matter may become complicated. 
Lu Ping said that the Chinese side wished for results should 
talks be resumed, but did not wish to see a repetition of the 
talks on the 1994/1995 electoral arrangements, which were a 
waste of time. It was a pity that the British side had not only 
refused to cooperate, but had even adopted a confrontational 
attitude. He could only express regrets and disappointment at 
that. 
  Regarding the British side claim that it would leave a 
fortune behind in Hong Kong for the Chinese Government, Lu Ping 
said that Britain had no right to say this. This was the Hong 
Kong people's money, and the Chinese Government did not want a 
penny. We tried hard to squeeze every cent to leave HK$25 
billion in the kitty during the airport negotiations. But we 
did not do that for Lu Ping, nor did we do it for the Chinese 
Government. It was for the people of Hong Kong in order to make 
preparations for a sound economic basis for the future SAR 
Government. Three years from now, Chris Patten would leave Hong 
Kong, but the Chinese side would have to bear responsibility for 
the Hong Kong people to ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity 
and stability. 
  When this reporter asked Lu Ping about Chris Patten quoting 
Sir David Akers-Jones at the House of Commons Foreign Affairs 
Select Committee on TV this morning, attacking the Chinese side 
by saying that "the Chinese style is not to rig elections, but 
they do like to know the result before they are held," Lu Ping 
said: Regarding such a "cheap joke" by Chris Patten, I can only 
despise it; it was looking at a gentleman's vision from the 
viewpoint of a mean person. I do not believe that Chris Patten 
did not have any idea about the electoral outcome in his 
constituency during the last general election in Britain; it was 
a pity that Chris Patten did not know his own limitations. That 
was why he made an erroneous estimation. Here we can have some 
idea about his so-called "credibility." As for the fact that he 
asked a certain Mr. Sze to respond to his speech on behalf of 
the Hong Kong people at the hearing, this leaves much room for 
criticism; people wonder just how many people in Hong Kong would 
regard this "loyal" (Lu Ping said forgive me for quoting Chris 
Patten's own words) follower as one of themselves? 
  The reporter hoped that Lu Ping would give an appraisal of 
Chris Patten. Lu Ping smiled and said: He is a politician, but 
not a good one, nor an honest one.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Lu's Uncivil Attacks"] </F>
  [Text] With the breakdown of the Sino-British political 
talks, Lu Ping has reverted to launching personal attacks on 
individual Hong Kong officials. In the space of a single speech 
the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) 
accused Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod of insincerity 
and cast doubt on the credentials of Michael Sze Chocheung. Mr 
Lu insinuated that the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs was 
not a representative of Hong Kong people: He was too much of a 
dedicated follower of Chris Patten. 
  Such attacks may be a sign of Mr Lu's own difficulties in 
Beijing. To his credit he pushed for the Sino-British talks -- 
against the advice of Zhou Nan, his rival at XINHUA (the New 
China News Agency). But he is now having to appear tougher than 
Mr Zhou. 
  China's criticism of those who speak out (like its 
invitations to others to appear before the Preliminary Working 
Committee to explain themselves) work to undermine the 
administration's loyalty to the Governor. Mr Lu's barbs can 
hardly fail to increase the pressure on Hong Kong civil servants 
and add to their sense of unease about the future. Taken to its 
logical extreme, his argument is that the 30 per cent or so of 
the population who have supported Mr Patten in opinion polls 
over the past year have no right to be considered Hong Kong 
people. For the bulk of the population that is absurd. But at 
the top of the civil service, where public explanation of, and 
vocal support for, official [as published] are part of the job 
in our executive-led system of government, the menace of a 
post-1997 witch hunt is unmistakeable. 
  Mr Sze's case, like that of Sir Hamish -- and of Anson Chan 
Fang On-sang when she came under attack, as Secretary for 
Economic Services, for her defence of the airport -- is a strong 
argument against Hong Kong-style executive-led government; it is 
an argument in favour of putting elected politicians or 
appointed Executive Councillors in charge of policy branches. 
  Career civil servants are supposed to be neutral, back-room 
workers. But under the system invented by Britain, and 
preserved by China under the Basic Law, they have to play a role 
similar to that of cabinet ministers in defending policies for 
which they are not politically responsible and with which they 
may privately disagree. Politicians elected or appointed, are in 
the job by choice and should be ready to face the consequences. 
Civil Servants have no choice. 
  Mr Lu and his Government are in large part responsible for 
the quandary in which civil servants find themselves. They are 
under attack, unfairly, for working within a system which 
Beijing has endorsed and insists must continue.

of attacks in the row between China and Britain, the Deputy to 
the Governor, Anson Chan Fang On-sang, said. 
  Mrs Chan was responding to comments by the Director of the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping. 
  Mr Lu questioned the legitimacy of the Secretary for 
Constitutional Affairs, Michael Sze Chocheung, to represent the 
people of Hong Kong at the British Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee (FAC) meeting. 
  Noting that Mr Sze had been asked to represent Hong Kong 
people at the FAC meeting, Mr Lu said: "How many people in Hong 
Kong regard this `faithful' follower (of Governor Chris Patten) 
as a Hong Kong `person'?" Responding to the comments, Mrs Chan 
said: "I very much hope that both sides could deal with matters 
(of substance) instead of targeting the individuals."

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 26 (AFP)--Hong Kong pressed China 
yet again Wednesday to stop arguing in public and return to the 
bargaining table to resolve the vexed issue of financing 
arrangements for the colony's mammoth new airport. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said he was 
"disappointed" by Beijing's threat the day before not to honor 
debts or contracts linked with Chek Lap Kok airport which 
straddle 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to China. "We are quite 
sure that the best way to make progress on the airport financing 
issue is to talk about it in the airport committee," Macleod 
told reporters. "That's the best way of finding a solution." 
  Government sources, requesting anonymity, spoke more 
forcefully. "The statement doesn't change anything at all," one 
of them said. "We're single-minded about talking with them 
before the next crisis occurs... The longer the delay, the 
greater the cost for all concerned -- especially for Hong Kong." 
  China has failed to respond to a formal British request on 
January 17 to reconvene the airport committee of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, charged with overseeing the 
20.3 billion U.S. dollar project. Instead it put out a 
statement Tuesday damning Governor Chris Patten's administration 
for securing 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars (216 million U.S.) 
in stop-gap financing from legislators to keep the vast project 
going. 
  China, it warned, "will not be liable for any expenditure 
and 
debt incurred by building the new airport," nor would it honor 
airport-related contracts or laws straddling 1997 -- which is 
also the year Chek Lap Kok is due to open. Britain agreed in a 
September 1991 pact to consult China on airport financing, but 
talks soon fell victim to Patten's effort to make Hong Kong's 
political insitutions more democratic ahead of the 1997 return 
to Beijing. 
  Macleod said he drew "some encouragement" from the 
statement's final paragraph, which stressed that Beijing "has 
always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong 
Kong." But he and other government officials were bewildered by 
its allegation that the project so far would leave the post-1997 
Hong Kong Chinese administration with debts in excess of 45 
billion dollars (5.82 billion U.S.). In fact, no money has been 
borrowed for Chek Lap Kok, one of the world's biggest public 
works projects, comprising not only the airport, but also a 
high-speed railway and new highways and bridges. "They haven't 
borrowed a single cent yet," the government source said. 
Besides, the 1991 Sino-British understanding on which the 
allegation was based referred to debt raised by the Hong Kong 
government -- not by government-owned corporations that will run 
the airport and railway. 
  While the war of words rages on, work continues 24 hours a 
day -- and, officials say, well on schedule -- at Chek Lap Kok, 
an outlying island one hour by boat from central Hong Kong that 
is shrouded by a fog of dust whipped up by giant yellow 
bulldozers and dump trucks. 
  Site reclamation director Frans Uiterwijk told foreign 
reporters that nearly 40 percent of the site preparation work 
has so far been completed by a multinational consortium of six 
companies -- including one owned by China. 
  "For the bulk (of the site work), I don't see any problem," 
he said, confident that the task will be completed in February 
1996 -- clearing the way for the first of two runways to be laid. 
  A deep hole the size of several football fields marks where 
the futuristic terminal building will be, pending foundation 
work to begin after contracts are awarded in March.

<F P=106> [By Fanny Wong, Chris Yeung and So Lai-fun] </F>
  [Text] China and Hong Kong yesterday narrowed their 
differences over financing the new airport, with Beijing saying 
it would be flexible in the amount of borrowings it would allow 
to extend beyond 1997 and Hong Kong expressing willingness to 
pump more money into the venture. 
  Although the two sides fell short of specifying how flexible 
they might be in the amount of equity injection and debt 
ceiling, a leading pro-China party yesterday announced its 
counter-proposal for the Government to inject a total of $89.2 
billion to fund the $99.2 billion airport and railway projects. 
  Yesterday's revelation of the counter-proposal by the 
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) came 
amid an argument between the two sides on whether China had 
three months ago put forward a new set of proposals to finance 
the airport and the rail link. 
  Government sources yesterday stressed that the last proposal 
on the table was that sent by the British side at the end of 
last June and which rejected China's repeated claim that Beijing 
had sent its counter-proposals to the British side. "The ball 
is in China's court," a source said. 
  But a mainland official asserted: "We have made a set of 
proposals to the British about three months ago. 
  "They gave no response. Instead, it has time and again 
sought fundings [from the Legislative Council.] Aren't they 
going too far?" The official said that China remained committed 
to the confidentiality rule but it was considering whether to 
publicise its counter-proposals on the financial package, 
claiming that the Hong Kong Government had ignored their demands 
and blatantly violated the airport accord. 
  But the official also offered a note of conciliation, saying 
that China was willing to agree to relax the debt ceiling of $5 
billion outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the 
new airport plan, despite the tough statement issued by the 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod also stressed that 
the 
Government was ready to show further flexibility in altering it 
latest financing package to facilitate a final accord. 
  Expressing disappointment at China's statement that 
financial 
or legal obligations not approved by Beijing would be invalid 
after 1997. Sir Hamish, however said he was encouraged by 
remarks that China was still open to further talks in the Joint 
Liaison Group Airport Committee. 
  "In suggesting a meeting of the Airport Committee [last 
week] 
we did make clear at the time to the Chinese side that we were 
ready to show further flexibility," he said. 
  Although Sir Hamish fell short of elaborating what 
flexibility the Government might offer, sources said that the 
British side was prepared to consider further in creasing the 
level of equity injections, which stands at $45.3 billion under 
the third financing package into the airport and railway plans. 
  At present, Hong Kong's reserves already topped the $130 
billion mark, said a source. The sources last night rejected 
the DAB proposal as unrealistic even given Hong Kong's present 
financial strength. But DAB chairman Tsang Yok-shing will fly 
to Beijing today and forward their counter-proposal to Chinese 
authority, confident that China would accept the party's 
suggestion. 
  Chinese officials have repeatedly called on the Government 
to 
inject more funds to the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and 
MTRC [Mass Transit Railway Corporation] to reduce the debts 
level, especially in the light of the huge reserves the 
Government will accumulate in the run-up to 1997. 
  A mainland official, who preferred anonymity, said: "Our 
demand is reasonable. The Government is fully capable of 
increasing the fundings without any difficulty." 
  He said Beijing has clearly told the British side that they 
were "willing to negotiate" on the level of government 
borrowings adding the $5 billion ceiling laid down in the MOU 
"can always be negotiated". The official questioned the motives 
behind the insistence of the Government not to increase its 
level of injections in spite of the surge in reserves in the 
next few years. 
  "Certainly they will continue to make massive spendings. We 
will tacitly let them make some gains. But they have to have a 
responsible and reasonable attitude," he said. 
  The official said the Chinese side has already turned a 
blind 
eye to the previous fundings for the PAA because "we cannot 
simply let the PAA dissolve". "Now they are asking for another 
$4 billion. Just look at the items in the funding proposals such 
as navigation system. Are they so urgently needed?" he asked. 
  But a government source said yesterday that while the 
British 
side was prepared to consider further raising the capital 
injection from the $45.3 billion it proposed under the third 
financing package, such a position did not mean the extra 
investment should be unlimited. 
  In considering any further amount of capital injection, the 
Government had to assess its impact on the reserves and whether 
it would result in putting excessive funds to the two 
corporations, thus undermining their alertness in operating with 
proper financial disciplines, the source said.

  [Text] Hong Kong and Chinese groups dealing with issues 
that may affect the rule of law after 1997 arc both complaining 
that their work is being hamstrung by the logjam in the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). 
  Both sides have called for the JLG to speed up its work. 
  The Government's International Law Division warns that it 
will run out of time to seal extradition treaties and other 
equally important international agreements. 
  The legal sub-group of the Beijing-appointed Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC) has found that some of Hong Kong's 
legislation that involves international treaties to which China 
is not a signatory will not be applicable after 1997 unless the 
JLG localises the laws. 
  A PWC member, Maria Tam Wai-chu said she hoped the JLG could 
speed up its work to facilitate discussion in the PWC or whether 
the existing British related laws complied with the Basic Law. 
China must grant approval before Hong Kong authorities can 
enter into lengthy negotiations with another country about 
treaties or agreements. Several rounds of talks are necessary 
before a deal can be tentatively struck and it must then be put 
before the Executive Council and the Chinese side in the JLG for 
final approval. 
  "We have reached the stage where all the programmes simply 
cannot be done in the remaining period of time," said the 
International Law Division's head, David Edwards. "It's simply 
not possible to do all the programmes in the time remaining and 
wouldn't be even if we poured in more resources. 
  "We are now beyond the point where, even if [the Chinese 
side] approved it all, we could finish." Mr Edwards said his 
division could possibly complete the extradition agreements if 
there was a breakthrough in co-operation with Chinese 
authorities at all levels of the negotiating process. "But it 
would have to be complete co- operation and I think it's pretty 
unlikely," said Mr Edwards, legal adviser in the JLG talks. "If 
the extradition treaties are not in force in 1997 there will be 
a gap in the law. In the area of extraditions, the SAR (Special 
Administrative Region) will not be able to return criminals from 
where they came, meaning Hong Kong could become a haven for 
undesirables. 
  "Extraditions are only one of the number of things we have 
to 
do. It will certainly not be possible now to finish off 
programmes that haven't even begun, such as reciprocal 
enforcement of judgments and mutual legal assistance, which are 
equally important." 
  The Government decided agreements with 18 to 20 countries in 
the region, North America and Europe would be essential for the 
territory to maintain international respectability and 
credibility. Mr Edwards predicted that necessary extradition 
agreements with at least six countries, or about one third of 
the total, would be left unresolved in 1997 at the present rate 
of progress. 
  In the area of extraditions the Government has not been able 
to even begin talks with 10 of these targeted countries, 
representing half the number on the priority list, because the 
Chinese side has not given the green light. Only three 
bi-lateral agreements for the surrender of fugitive offenders 
have been sealed -- with the Netherlands, Canada and Australia 
-- since the division began direct negotiations with Chinese 
approval in 1990. The agreements, binding under international 
law, will survive the territory's handover. 
  Until 1997, the territory will continue to exchange 
fugitives 
with about 90 countries under a legal framework tied to the 
British system. More than 30 suspected murderers, drug 
traffickers and organised criminals were last year extradited 
between Hong Kong and the United States, Sweden, Canada, New 
Zealand and Macao in what the Legal Department called "a banner 
year for international co- operation in fighting crime". 
  The other important international agreements even further 
behind schedule include reciprocal enforcement of judgments in 
law; the abolition of visas to streamline visits by Hong Kong 
businessmen and tourists to participating countries; mutual 
legal assistance, and investment promotion and protection. 
Senior government sources have blamed "the excruciatingly slow 
pace" of the Chinese side in the JLG for the lack of progress. 
Sources said that in some cases, requests to begin talks with 
other countries have been on the negotiating table for three 
years. "One can only assume [the Chinese] are connecting it 
with the Governor's constitutional reform proposals," said a 
government official. "But they can't possibly hurt the British 
by this. It can only hurt Hong Kong and its people." 
  The legal representative on the Legislative Council, Simon 
Ip 
Sik-on, said yesterday Hong Kong would be harmed by a failure to 
seal extradition agreements by 1997, but he believed there was 
still enough time. "Hong Kong could become a refuge for 
fugitives. Do we want to be a receptacle for fugitives? Of 
course not. If there is no agreement, the ends of justice will 
be defeated for both sides." 
  In Beijing, PWC member Ms Tam said she hoped the JLG could 
speed up its work on localisation of laws. She said the PWC 
legal sub- group had spent the weekend going over some of the 
Hong Kong laws to bring them in line with the Basic Law. One 
difficulty they encountered was how to localise those 
British-related laws to the future SAR since some involved 
international treaties in which Britain, but not China, was a 
signatory. One example was the Supreme Court Ordinance which 
had involved the Reine International Treaty in which China was 
not a signatory. 
  Ordinances which were at present extended from the United 
Kingdom acts, such as the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, had to be 
localised, she said. There were at least 100 similar cases 
which were under the discussion of the JLG. Ms Tam said she 
hoped that the diplomatic body could speed up its works. "As 
long as these problems remain unresolved, it will leave a 
crevice. It will become uncertain for us whether to wait for a 
conclusion from the JLG or go it alone by ourselves."

March Toward the Mainland's Infrastructure Construction -- An 
Observation of the Trend of Hong Kong Businessmen's Investment 
in 1993"] 
  [Excerpt] Hong Kong, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The economic 
exchanges and trade between Hong Kong and the mainland in 1993 
showed an upsurge of investment in the mainland's energy, 
transportation, and other infrastructure projects by Hong Kong's 
well-known consortiums. 
<H5>  Infrastructure Attracts Great Attention </H5>
  In October 1993, Hutchison-Whampoa, Ltd. of Hong Kong and 
the 
Shenzhen Dongpeng Industry Company, Ltd. jointly formed the 
Yantian International Container Terminal Company, Ltd. to build 
and manage the Yantian International Container Terminal. With a 
total investment estimated at greater than 5 billion yuan, the 
project is the largest joint venture in Shenzhen. On 5 October 
1993, Premier Li Peng met with Li Ka-shing, the richest person 
in Hong Kong and the president of Hutchison-Whampoa Ltd. Li 
Ka-shing was attending a signing ceremony in Beijing for the 
project. Premier Li Peng said during the meeting: China faces 
an increasing demand for transportation as its economy develops 
further, its door opens wider, and its foreign economic and 
trade activities increase. The mainland's use of foreign funds 
has been expanded to include the area of infrastructure, 
including ports, railroads, airports, and power stations. 
  Premier Li Peng's remarks have summed up from another angle 
the trend of Hong Kong businessmen's investment in the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will step up 
the development of a shareholding economy this year in a move to 
invigorate major state-owned enterprises, according to a senior 
government official. 
  Li Junhua, director of the Municipal Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, said that one-third of the 1,000 
major state-run enterprises in the city are set to be turned 
into joint-stock companies this year. 
  A breakthrough was made in the number of shareholding 
companies last year, he said. 
  In 1993 the municipal government approved 140 joint-stock 
companies, bringing the number of such companies to 176. These 
companies are engaged in commerce, science and technology, 
manufacturing, finance, real estate development and consultancy 
services. 
  Of the 176 companies, 108 are limited-liability companies, 
Li 
said. These 176 companies will eventually sell shares to the 
tune of 9.92 billion yuan, with 95.6 percent to be issued to the 
state and legal entities; the rest will be offered to Chinese 
individuals and foreign investors to buy. 
  According to him, Tianqiao, Tianlong and two other 
shareholding companies had their shares listed in China and 
abroad in 1993. 
  He said, "their success marks a new stage in introducing the 
joint-stock system to China's capital, and will help local 
businesses participate in international competition and 
institute a modern enterprise system." 
  Efforts will be made to enable more enterprises to issue 
shares elsewhere this year, he said. 
  The Beijing Department Store Group, the urban and rural 
trading center and two other shareholding companies are set to 
issue shares elsewhere in February, he said. 
  Meanwhile, the Fangzheng Group and several other joint-stock 
companies will try to issue shares overseas later this year. 
  Li Junhua said that the existing shareholding companies will 
concentrate on transforming their operational mechanisms to as 
to introduce a modern enterprise system as soon as possible. 
  "The shareholding system has injected vigor into 
enterprises," he said. For example, assets of the Tianjin 
Department Store Company, which led the nation in instituting 
such a system in 1984, shot up to nearly 200 million yuan-worth 
from 1.6 million yuan-worth last year, and its annual earnings 
from sales soared from 27 million yuan to 200 million yuan.

  [Summary] Programs of reform and opening up have promoted 
economic and social development in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region. The tremendous achievements scored by the region in the 
development over the past 15 years [1978-1993] are obvious to 
all. The region ranked fifteenth among 29 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout the country 
according to the general index of social development in 1992. 
  The region's GNP in 1992 showed a 213-percent increase over 
1978 and the yearly average increase reached 8.5 percent. The 
region's GNP increased from 18.39 billion yuan in 1978 to 37.862 
billion yuan in 1992 and calculated in terms of comparable 
prices, showed a 46.6-percent increase. The yearly average 
increase reached 8 percent and surpassed the national scale of 
7.9 percent. The region's per capita GNP increased from 888 
yuan in 1987 [as published] to 1,712 yuan in 1992 and the yearly 
average increase reached 6.5 percent, same as the national level 
of 6.56 percent. The region's 1993 GNP is expected to show a 
10-percent increase. 
  The region realized 18.027 billion yuan in total 
agricultural 
output value in 1992, showing a 203-percent increase when 
calculated in terms of comparable prices in 1978. The yearly 
average increase reached 8.2 percent. The position occupied by 
the region's total agricultural output value in the country went 
up from twentieth in 1987 [as published] to ninth in 1992. The 
region stabilized its grain output of 9.5 billion kg over the 
past four years. Since 1992 the region has scored a grain 
output of over 10 billion kg in the two-year period and 
prefulfilled its plan to become self-supportive in grains. The 
region's grain output in the country has gone up from its rank 
of twenty one to seventeen at present and that occupied by the 
regions' per capita grain output in the country has gone up from 
twentieth in the past to third at present. The region's per 
capita oil-bearing seed output has ranked the region first in 
the country. The region has reaped a bumper harvest in animal 
husbandry over the past nine years and stabilized the number of 
animals to 50 million. It has scored 55 million head of animal 
over the past three years. 
  The region's total industrial output value in 1992 surpassed 
that of 1978 by 240 percent. The yearly average increase 
reached 9.1 percent. The position occupied by the region's coal 
output in the country went up from tenth in 1978 to seventh in 
1992, that occupied by the region's power output went up from 
twenty fifth in 1978 to fifteenth in 1992, and that occupied by 
the region's steel output went up from ninth in 1978 to seventh 
in 1992. The region's rare earth output has ranked the region 
first in the country. 
  The region's retail sale of social commodities in 1992 
surpassed that of 1978 by 408 percent. The yearly average 
increase reached 12.3 percent. The 1993 retail sale is expected 
to reach 21.9 billion yuan and to show a 17-percent increase 
over 1992. The region's total volume of exported or imported 
goods increased from $15.52 million in 1978 to $940 million in 
1992 and showed over 6,000-percent of an increase during the 
period. Yearly average increase reached 34.2 percent. The 
region's total volume of exports or imports in 1993 is expected 
to exceed $1.2 billion. 
  Along with the rapid economic development, the region's 
local 
financial revenue in 1992 surpassed that of 1978 by 466 percent. 
The yearly average increase in the region's local financial 
revenue during the period from 1980 [as published] to 1992 
reached 20.7 percent and surpassed the national average increase 
by 8.9 percentage points. The yearly average increase in the 
region's local financial revenue during the period from 1978 to 
1992 reached 15 percent and surpassed the national average 
increase by four percentage points. The rate of self supporting 
in finance increased from 42.65 percent in 1978 to 54.32 percent 
in 1992. The region's local financial revenue in 1993 is 
expected to exceed 5 billion yuan and to show a 28-percent 
increase over 1992. The rate of self-sufficient financing in 
1993 is expected to reach about 63 percent.

  [Summary] Since the Third Plenary of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee and the enforcement of reform and opening up, the 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has steadily improved the 
livelihood of urban residents and of the broad masses of 
peasants and herdsmen along with rapid development in its 
economic construction and further reinforcement of the actual 
strength of its economy. 
  The region's per capita income for living expenses of urban 
residents increased from 274 yuan in 1978 to 1,344 yuan in 1992

net income of peasants and herdsmen increased from 131 yuan in 
1978 to 719 yuan in 1992 and is expected to reach 820 yuan in 
1993, showing a 689 yuan, or 526-percent increase over 1978 as 
well as a 161-percent increase excluding the factor of price 
hikes. Of the net income of 1993, peasants' income may reach 
772 yuan, showing a 646 yuan and 511-percent increase over 1978, 
or an increase of 161 percent when excluding the price hike 
factor, while herdsmen's income may reach 1,125 yuan to show a 
937 yuan and 496-percent increase over 1978 or an increase of

  [Summary] Over the past 15 years and since the enforcement 
of reform and opening up, the largest increase in the 
investments for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was in 
fixed assets. During the 15-year period, the region invested 
94.7 billion yuan in fixed assets, equal to the 5.95 times the 
investments made in capital construction in the 29 years before 
this 15-year period. The region also invested 32.8 billion yuan 
in building large and medium-sized key projects equal to 2.1 
times the number of investments made in capital construction in 
the 29 years before the period. The volume of investments made 
in 1992 or 1993 respectively surpassed the total volume of 
investments made in the capital construction during the Fourth 
Five-Year Plan or the Fifth Five-Year Plan periods. 
  Of these investments, those made in capital construction of 
agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and water conservancy 
works have reached 2.03 billion yuan during the 15-year period. 
By the end of 1992, the region possessed 1,627 pumping 
stations; 68 large and medium-sized reservoirs; over 1,360 small 
reservoirs in hilly areas; and 16,100 motor-pumped wells. 
  During the period from 1979 to 1993, the region invested 
28.3 
billion yuan in the capital construction of industries of energy 
resources and raw materials. Of these investments, that in the 
coal industry reached 11.06 billion yuan; that in the power 
industry, 8.54 billion yuan; and that in the petroleum industry, 
3.27 billion yuan. Over the past 15 years, increases in coal 
output was seen annually, so that investment has reached 25.96 
million metric tons; the installed capacity rose anew due to the 
investment, to 3.3 million kw; and the annual crude oil output 
increased due to the investment to reach 1.266 million metric 
tons. 
  Over the past 15 years, the region has invested 1.854 
billion 
yuan in projects of technical renewal and renovation. These 
investments have been chiefly used in the 35 technical 
renovation projects for the metallurgy, nonferrous metal, power, 
chemistry, machine-building, and light and textile industries; 
as well as for the departments of communications and 
transportation and of post and telecommunications. 
  Over the past 15 years, the region has invested 79.8 billion 
yuan in the construction projects, equal to 4.1 times total 
investment made in this regard in the 29 years before the 
period. Railways newly built in the region during the period 
have reached 1,229 km, the annual railway transport capacity 
newly renovated during the period has gone from 21.7 million to 
37.4 million metric tons, highways newly built in the region 
during the period have reached 1,262 km, and microwave 
transmission lines newly established in the region during the 
period have reached 3,951 km.

  [Summary] Over the past 15 years and since the enforcement 
of reform and opening up, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has 
conducted trade exchanges and established economic and technical 
cooperation relations with over 2,000 business partners from 
over 60 countries and regions in the world. More than 500 
commodities turned out by the region have entered international 
markets. 
  During the 15-year period, the region approved 422 projects 
of utilizing foreign funds and foreign investment involved in 
the signed contracts amounted to $2 billion. Of these foreign 
investments, $1.64 billion are foreign loans; and $260 million 
are from direct investments by foreign businessmen or firms. 
  By the end of September this year, the total number of 
"three 
categories of foreign-funded" enterprises reached 654, with 
total investment amounting to $1.1 billion. Of these 
enterprises, 328 were established in the first three quarters of 
this year and surpassed the total number of such enterprises 
established before. 
  During the period from 1979 to 1992, the region's 
accumulated 
volume of foreign exchange earned from exports reached $2.8 
billion and is equal to the 1.4 times of the total volume scored 
by the region in this regard in the 29 years before this period. 
The yearly average increase exceeded 30 percent. 
  The volume of exported or imported goods in 1993 is expected 
to surpass $1.2 billion and to top the previous peak. As for 
volume, exported goods is expected to reach about $650 million. 
  In 1992, the region's total volume of barter trades along 
the 
border areas reached $463 million, showed a 426-time increase 
over 1983 [as printed], and accounted for 50 percent of total 
export and import volume in foreign trades. As of now, the 
trading and economic enterprises throughout the region have 
established over 30 branch offices in the CIS, Mongolia, and 
East European countries. 
  In 1992, the region newly signed contracts for 132 labor 
migration projects with foreign countries, including Iraq, 
Thailand, Jordan, and Australia. Funds involved in the signed 
contracts reached $58.58 million and the region dispatched 3,840 
laborers, engineers, and technical personnel in the year.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "In Accelerating Infrastructural Construction, </F>
We Should Also Act According to our Capability"] 
  [Text] To accelerate the construction of communications, 
transport, and other infrastructural projects is of great 
strategic significance in attaining the second- stage strategic 
objective of development and in ensuring sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 
1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. The 
stagnation of infrastructural construction has upset and 
restricted the development of our national economy. In the 
1990's -- during which time our country will raise its national 
economy to a new level -- the task of infrastructural 
construction is even more arduous and heavy. We must seize 
opportunity, develop overall plans and rational distribution, 
plan, effectively build and manage infrastructural 
constructionl, and make it yield maximum social and economic 
benefits. 
  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, we have 
gradually changed the old pattern of relying completely on state 
investment in the field of infrastructural construction, and 
have created a new situation in which the central government, 
local governments, and enterprises make joint investments 
through various channels and comprehensively use foreign funds 
in infrastructural construction at various levels. Enthusiasm 
has been greatly aroused in all quarters. Infrastructural 
construction is proceeding vigorously in all localities, 
entering a stage of rapid development. However, in recent years 
infrastructural construction has also shown a trend of 
disregarding objective conditions and economic efficiency, and 
of blindly seeking large and rapid construction. Some 
localities are so eager to accelerate development they vie to 
put forward impractical development objectives, ignore the 
unified plan for infrastructural construction, and build 
"small-and-all-embracing" as well as duplicate projects in small 
areas. Some of them disregard the realities of local financial 
and material resources; they love to build large projects and 
emulate others, thus wasting money and creating low utility 
rates and losses in operation. Some of them violate 
construction procedures and encourage the practice of "beginning 
construction first to hasten approval from higher authorities" 
and "acting first and reporting afterwards." Some of them 
down-size large, key projects in their reports so it is easier 
to get state approval; after obtaining approval, they will 
upgrade the projects in both scale and standards. Others give 
foreign businessmen unauthorized guarantees for greater share of 
profits from joint ventures and cooperative infrastructure 
projects. The consequences of so doing are detrimental to the 
healthy development of a socialist market economy, to the 
rational allocation of resources, to overall economic 
efficiency, and to the coordinated development of the economy as 
a whole. Some of the practices even hurt the interests of the 
state. For this reason, leaders at all levels must pay great 
attention to them. 
  We should be realistic in doing everything. While we 
should do everything we can, we should act according to our 
capability. Since the policy decision on a major 
infrastructural project and its execution directly affect the 
overall arrangements of the national economy and the overall 
macroeconomic balance, it must be made under unified state 
planning and guidance. Infrastructural projects are usually 
systems engineering projects which require large investment; 
long construction times; and complex, well-coordinated support 
facilities. They must follow construction procedures prescribed 
by the state. The construction procedures embody the 
requirements of the inherent laws of engineering. Strictly 
following construction procedures is an indispensable guarantee 
for making scientific decisions on a construction project and 
for its smooth construction. The objective of economic 
construction is to yield benefits. In infrastructural 
construction, we should also give full consideration to both 
social and economic benefits. We should try in every possible 
way, and should concentrate our strength to build the 
infrastructural projects which concern the interests of the 
whole and meet the urgent needs of economic development. 
However, infrastructural construction should proceed in an 
orderly and step by step manner. It will not do to lag behind. 
It will not do to either go all out in building projects 
blindly in disregard of feasibility and benefits, or to exceed 
by too much the actual needs. In our country -- where the 
economy is relatively backward and shortages of funds and 
material will exist for a long time to come -- we should 
concentrate our forces even more in order to fight a battle of 
annihilation and prevent duplicate and blind construction from 
causing great waste. 
  For infrastructural construction, all localities and 
departments should do a good job in formulating a regional 
development plan under unified state planning and guidance, and 
in consideration of their own realities and characteristics. 
Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in studying 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
should comprehensively and accurately understand Comrade 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, should firmly establish the notion of taking 
the entire country into account, should act according to our 
capability in a realistic manner, should stress benefits, and 
should do a down-to-earth job in effectivley building 
infrastructural projects.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Chen Yun (7115 5366): "A Prelude to New </F>
Enterprise Reforms -- What One Sees and Hears at the State 
Economic and Trade Commission"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- Recently people from 
various localities and enterprises who come to visit the State 
Economic and Trade Commission suddenly number more than before. 
They come not to ask for money, preferential policy, or 
authorization for certain projects. They come to recommend 
themselves to be the experimental units of modern enterprise 
system. 
  One day around the end of last year, this reporter had an 
appointment to interview Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the 
State Economic and Trade Commission. However, the manager of 
the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Company was already in Chen 
Qingtai's office early in the morning. The manager requested 
that his company be included in the 100 large and medium 
state-owned enterprises selected to try out the modern 
enterprise system. Soon afterwards, some representatives of the 
Shanxi Provincial Government came to visit Chen directly from 
the railroad station after an overnight train ride. They 
strongly recommended Taiyuan City be included in the 10 cities 
selected for the experiment on "accelerating the structural 
readjustment, reducing unreasonable burdens, and replenishing 
the working capital of enterprises." Before the Shanxi comrades 
left, comrades from Anhui's Bengbu City came to submit their 
application for the pilot project. 
  After a long wait, this reporter at last entered Chen's 
office for the interview. With hospitality toward visitors 
still lingering, Chen Qingtai said: In the reform of 
state-owned enterprises this year, we will continue to implement 
the "Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of 
Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." In addition, 
we will select 1,000 enterprises for the experiment, by stages 
and in groups, on state-appointed board of supervisors. We will 
select 100 enterprises for the experiment on modern enterprise 
system. We will also select 10 cities for the experiment on 
reducing the burdens of enterprises and establishing a sound 
social security system. At present, more than 20 cities have 
applied for playing the experimental role of the 10 cities, and 
more than 130 enterprises have applied for the role of trying 
out the modern enterprise system. In the meantime, we have 
consulted with other departments concerned and initially 
selected 33 ministerial enterprises as the first group to 
experiment on state-appointed board of supervisors. 
  In the last two months, the State Economic and Trade 
Commission has done a series of foundation-laying work for these 
enterprise reform pilot projects. It has run two seminars on 
modern enterprise system and trained a large number of cadres. 
It has inspected 100 enterprises with respect to their 
implementation of the new accounting system. It has clearly 
understood the situation of 9,400 enterprises selected to 
conduct experimental appraisal of fixed assets and circulating 
funds. It has done a great deal of investigation and 
coordination before the selection of enterprises for 
experimental reforms. 
  Both the leadership and the rank and file have been busy 
with the new round of enterprise reforms. Chen Qingtai, who 
came from a large state-owned enterprise, remained coolheaded. 
He said: Many forceful reform measures have been introduced 
this year. Although the state has fully considered state-owned 
enterprises' current situation in the course of promoting 
reforms, short-term pains are inevitable. For instance, in the 
past enterprises turned to the government when they ran into 
difficulty because the government could lower taxes and allowed 
them to retain more profits. This road has now been basically 
blocked. Another example is that the merger of different 
exchange rates, which will benefit export enterprises, will also 
bring difficulties to some import enterprises. Among 
enterprises, "some will rejoice while others will grieve...." 
For this reason, we should pay attention to studying new 
circumstances and problems from time to time. Currently, 
workers, staff members, factory directors, and departments are 
all raising questions. We should, therefore, make particular 
efforts to intensify reform-related publicity and training, 
mobilize all propaganda and training organs, and give everybody 
a clear idea of the new reforms in terms of substance and 
implementation; otherwise, people will not support us for lack 
of understanding. 
  On the first work day after New Year, this reporter again 
visited the State Economic and Trade Commission to conduct an 
interview. A meeting was in progress at the commission; it was 
held by the office established to implement the 
soon-to-be-promulgated "Regulations on Supervising and Managing 
the Property of State-Owned Enterprises." From a 10-minute 
interview with Wei Dongjin, deputy director of the commission's 
Department in Charge of Enterprises, the reporter gathered the 
following information: The office, which was founded just more 
than a month ago, has made fairly ample preparations for the 
promulgation of the "Regulations on Supervising and Managing the 
Property of State-Owned Enterprises." The "Opinions on 
Implementing the 'Regulations on Supervising and Managing the 
Property of State- Owned Enterprises'," which have been revised 
many times, are being co-signed by various departments. The 
preliminary drafts of the "Charter of the Board of Supervisors" 
and the "Detailed Rules and Regulations on Supervisory Work" 
have been completed. The "Interim Measures for Managing Changes 
in the Property Rights of State-Owned Enterprises" and the 
"Index System and Evaluation Measures for Preserving and 
Increasing the Values of State-Owned Assets" are being drafted. 
Additionally, preparations have been made for holding news 
briefings and providing training material following the 
promulgation of the "Regulations on Supervising and Managing the 
Property of State-Owned Enterprises." We can say that 
everything is ready, and all we need is an "east wind" [the 
decisive factor].

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Bian Hongwei: "Managerial Wages Based on </F>
Profits and Performance"] 
  [Text] An annuity pilot programme linking income with 
performance for directors and managers of State enterprises is 
set to begin. 
  Officials say this is not a simple change of the pay 
cycle--from once a month to once a year. But it ties 
management's earnings to government wishes to invigorate State 
enterprises. 
  Aside from performance, salary will be decided by individual 
enterprises' fixed assets, their tax payment and profit 
turnovers to the State as well as local average income level. 
  The reform aims to separate management payments from 
ordinary 
workers to promote self-constraint within enterprises, Wang 
Chongguang, an official with the Ministry of Labour, told China 
Daily. 
  Directors and general managers of State enterprises will 
shoulder more responsibilities and risks with the change. 
  "The new system encourages managerial staff to work as hard 
as they can because the better their performance, the more they 
get," said Wang, who is in charge of the distribution division 
within enterprises. 
  The annuity is to be divided into two parts: the basic 
salary and the risk income. 
  According to Wang, the basic wage is about equal to annual 
total income under the existing monthly payment system. Risk 
income will depend on how much profit directors bring to their 
enterprises as well as to the owner--the State. 
  The new system stipulates that directors can only get their 
full basic wage if their enterprises meet annual fiscal goals. 
  If their enterprises turn over more taxes and profits to the 
State, directors' bonuses, or risk income, can be 50 to 200 
percent more than their basic salary. 
  Directors whose firms fail to reach targeted quotas, 
however, 
will receive lower pay than the basic annuity fixed by the State. 
  But the Ministry of Labour did not specify the degree of 
income reductions. 
  "The system is formulated on the ground that the average 
production cycle usually lasts a relatively longer period than 
that for issuing monthly wages," Wang said. 
  "To judge the performance of a director, one has to know the 
enterprise's economic indexes, including the industrial output 
value. But the indexes are not available until the end or the 
beginning of a year," he added. 
  The system is waiting for State Council's approval. Once 
endorsed, it will be put into effect within a few months and 
327,000 directors and general managers of State enterprises will 
be affected. For the first year, they will get pre-payments of 
their income to cover daily expenditures. 
  It is hoped that the move can motivate top managers of State 
enterprises to improve overall firm performance, Wang said. 
  Presently, State enterprises play a dominant role in China's 
various economic sectors, but an estimated one-third of them are 
in the red and their workers lead a comparatively poor life. 
  The annuity system is a continuation of reforms, not a fresh 
move to boost State firms, Labour Ministry officials say. 
  As early as 1986, the country mapped out reforms to regulate 
salaries of management at State enterprises. 
  That regulation said directors could be paid one- to 
three-times higher than common workers depending on profits. 
  The regulations to a certain degree, motivated directors. 
Yet during the implementation, problems cropped up. 
  Some managers, even those of money-losing enterprises, did 
nothing but try to increase their own income. Many directors 
received far more than was permitted by the regulations. Common 
complaints focused on directors abusing their power to make 
profits. 
  The malpractice was largely checked during the national 
anticorruption campaign last year. But the rational parts of 
the system, such as more bonuses for managers with outstanding 
achievements, have also been dropped in many parts of the 
country. 
  "The annuity system is a concrete step to deepen the reform 
on the management of State-owned enterprises," said Xu Yanjun, 
also with the Ministry of Labour. 
  The system is in line with the goal of defining the property 
rights of State enterprises. 
  Under the new practice, directors and managers will serve as 
the legal representatives of State assets at their enterprises. 
They are responsible for maintaining and increasing the values 
of the properties, said Xu. 
  Previous enterprise reforms have failed to touch the 
property 
rights of State-owned firms. 
  The annuity system can help to promote a sound property 
relationship within enterprises and speed up the integration of 
a modern enterprise system, Xu said.

<F P=106> [Procedures promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and </F>
Economic Cooperation, the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy, and the State Economic and Trade Commission on 5 August 
1993: "Implementation Procedures for Changes in the Operation 
Mechanism in Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Chapter I. General Principles 
  Article 1. These procedures have been formulated in 
accordance with the "Regulations on Changes of Operation 
Mechanism in Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole 
People" and in light of the operational features of foreign 
economic relations and trade. 
  Article 2. These procedures are applicable to enterprises 
directly under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC]. They are applicable in reference to all 
kinds of foreign economic relations and trade enterprises across 
the country. 
  Article 3. In these procedures, the "enterprises directly 
under MOFTEC" refer to enterprise legal persons which are set up 
according to the conditions laid down in the General Principles 
of the Civil Code and are approved and managed by MOFTEC and 
which primarily engage in foreign economic relations and trade. 
<H5>  Chapter II. Operational Form of Enterprise Assets </H5>
  Article 4. The operational form of enterprise assets is 
usually the contractual management responsibility system. With 
regard to foreign trade enterprises practicing the contractual 
management responsibility system, MOFTEC assesses and fixes 
their contracted targets of export exchange earning amount, 
profit amount, and state- owned assets appreciation rate. With 
regard to other enterprises, MOFTEC assesses and fixes their 
contracted targets of profit amount and state-owned assets 
appreciation rate (provisions will be made for foreign aid 
enterprises). 
  Article 5. Enterprises sign contracts with MOFTEC in 
accordance with the assets management right laid down by the 
state. MOFTEC guides and supervises the enterprises in 
organizing implementation of the contracts. 
  Article 6. Enterprises demanding separation of taxes and 
profits may, upon approval, experiment on the "separation of 
taxes and profits." 
  Article 7. With the approval of MOFTEC and relevant 
departments, enterprises with the necessary conditions may 
operate under the joint-stock system. 
<H5>  Chapter III. Autonomy in Enterprise Management </H5>
  Article 8. After handing over profits according to 
stipulations, enterprises retain all the rest and, while 
ensuring the preservation and appreciation of enterprise assets, 
independently decide the ratios and use of all funds from the 
retained profits. 
  Article 9. Enterprise reserve funds, export venture capital, 
and special barter funds carried over from the previous years 
may be used according to regulations. 
  Article 10. Enterprises deal in import and export 
commodities under state control according to allocated 
quantities. In specific implementation, enterprises may reduce 
or increase import and export quantities according to changes in 
domestic and overseas markets, but they should report the 
reduced quantities to MOFTEC by the end of September each year 
and get prior approval for the increased quantities according to 
relevant provisions. 
  Article 11. Except for commodities under unified and joint 
state management, enterprises may independently decide the scope 
of business according to their own business advantages and scale 
merits, register with the industry and commerce administration 
departments, and report to MOFTEC for the record. 
  Article 12. Enterprises which still do not have the right to 
deal in foreign trade may apply for the right in accordance with 
the relevant state regulations. 
  Article 13. Enterprises with the necessary conditions may 
apply for the right to carry out contracted projects and labor 
cooperation business abroad according to regulations. 
  Article 14. In accordance with relevant state regulations 
and upon approval, enterprises may engage in domestic trade, the 
sales on the domestic market of goods imported with self-owned 
foreign exchange, and the retail or wholesale on the domestic 
market of products made by their subsidiaries (state franchise 
shops should be dealt with according to regulations). They may 
also apply for such business as real estate, tourism, 
transportation, and advertisement to relevant competent 
departments. 
  Article 15. Except for a small number of capital goods in 
the lists of price controls based on division of labor, which 
were promulgated by the State Council's pricing department and 
the provincial-level government pricing department, and a few 
industrial consumer goods for daily use whose prices are 
controlled by the State Council's pricing department and the 
provincial-level government pricing department, enterprises may 
decide by themselves the prices of imported commodities and the 
domestic selling prices of products made by their subsidiaries. 
They may also decide by themselves the purchasing prices of 
export commodities according to fluctuating market conditions 
and the principle of giving favorable price for good quality. 
  Article 16. In line with business needs and upon approval 
by relevant departments, enterprises may set up branch offices 
in certain places of the country. With agreement from Chinese 
embassies in certain foreign countries, they may set up trade 
offices abroad (the setting up of trade offices in the Hong Kong 
and Macao region should be examined and approved according to 
regulations). 
  Article 17. Upon approval, enterprises having a foreign 
exchange income may open a spot exchange account at a bank of 
their own choice. Those with the necessary conditions may apply 
for the setting up of financial companies or trust and 
investment companies. Companies outside the borders may freely 
remit into or out of the county the profits they retain 
according to state regulations. 
  Article 18. The foreign exchange quotas retained by 
enterprises may be freely swapped with parties of their own 
choice in other provinces and cities through swap centers. 
Enterprise groups may regulate supply and demand among internal 
companies with independent financial accounting. When going 
through the settlement procedures at a foreign exchange swap 
center, enterprises should accept supervision by relevant 
management departments. 
  Article 19. Enterprises may decide by themselves the 
relevant domestic construction projects invested with retained 
or self-raised funds. In the case of productive construction 
projects launched with retained profits, enterprises may, in 
accordance with state regulations, apply for a refund of the 40 
percent income tax that has already been paid for the enterprise 
reinvested portion. 
  Article 20. Under the guidance of the state industrial 
policy, enterprises may decide by themselves on the setting up 
of Sino- foreign joint ventures or Sino-foreign cooperative 
projects that come within the authority of the local governments 
in the area in which the projects are to be built, to examine 
and approve total investment amounts. They should go through 
the procedure with the relevant government departments in 
relation to the project conditions and report to MOFTEC for the 
record. 
  Article 21. Through the state's stipulated channels, 
enterprises may borrow money from abroad within the scope of 
foreign credits approved by the state. 
  Article 22. In light of their economic efficiency and 
ability to withstand the strains, enterprises may proportionally 
draw from the sales turnover, funds for sales promotion, science

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Hong Fei (7703 7378)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- As of 1 
January 1994, China is practicing a new financial and tax reform 
program, including the tax sharing system that makes new 
arrangements for central and local financial powers. The 
purpose of the tax-sharing system is to recover some of the 
financial power previously delegated to local governments, 
strengthen the financial power of the central government, 
rectify the lopsided situation in recent years in which the 
central government and local governments shared 30 and 70 
percent of financial power respectively, and gradually return to 
the normal 70:30 ratio between central and local financial 
powers. This is aimed at checking the unhealthy tendency of 
localities blindly expanding investments, which leads to an 
overheated economy, strengthening the authority and 
macroeconomic regulation and control capability of the central 
government, and ensure the high-speed, stable, and healthy [kuai 
su wen ding jian kang 1816 6643 4489 1353 0256 1660] development 
of the national economy. 
  The main contents of tax-sharing system reform are as 
follows: 
  First, the central government concentrates the necessary 
financial resources. The financial and tax revenues directly 
collected by the central government should account for over 60 
percent of the country's total financial and tax revenues. 
Second, taxation is divided into central taxes, local taxes, 
and taxes shared by the central and local governments. Central 
taxes include customs duty, consumption tax, central enterprise 
income tax, product tax, railways, banks, insurance tax, and so 
on. Local taxes included business tax, local enterprise income 
tax, personal income tax, agricultural tax, urban construction 
tax, and so on. Taxes shared by the central and local 
governments include value-added tax, resources tax (marine 
resources tax belong totally to the central government), 
securities transaction tax, unified industrial and commercial 
tax, and so on. Third, the central and local governments set up 
taxation organs respectively. Fourth, the central government 
implements a system of making refunds and shifting payments to 
local governments. Some of the central financial revenues will 
be refunded to local governments in the form of allocations lest 
the local governments will receive less financial revenues than 
before the reform. 
  Under the financial pattern practiced over the years in the 
past, which came into being with the implementation of the 
central policy of "decentralizing power and giving up profits" 
to local governments and which was called the "contract system 
under which each unit is responsible for its own surplus or 
deficit," the country's financial and tax revenues favor the 
localities. Under such a system, the proportion of the central 
financial revenues in the GNP has dropped and its macroeconomic 
regulation and control capability weakened year after year. 
Statistics show that central financial revenues accounted for 
well over 30 percent of the GNP in 1978 but dropped to only 14 
percent in 1992. Meanwhile, the central financial revenues 
accounted only for 38 percent of the country's total financial 
revenues, much lower than the 60-odd percent level in other 
countries generally. As a result, the central financial 
deficits are getting more serious while the local finance enjoys 
an ample surplus, and this has given rise to a situation whereby 
the central government is poor while the local governments are 
rich. 
  However, the substitution of the "tax-sharing system" for 
the 
"contract system under which each unit is responsible for its 
own surplus or deficit" is likely to cause some losses to a few 
coastal provinces and municipalities, where the economy has 
developed quite rapidly in recent years, and touched off some 
objections in discussions last year. For this reason, Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji, who took charge of financial and economic 
work, went to 16 provinces and municipalities including Hainan, 
Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Tianjin at 
the head of work teams to discuss with local leaders the 
interest relationship of the tax-sharing system. It is said 
that, after careful calculations, some provinces, which 
previously had entertained serious misgivings, discovered that 
the effect of the tax-sharing system was not so big after all 
and, therefore, supported the central policy with pleasure. On 
the other hand, some interior provinces in western China, such 
as Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu, have heartily welcomed the 
tax-sharing system, holding that not only will this measure 
increase the financial resources of the central government but 
enable the central government to allocate more funds to help the 
backward regions develop their economy and thus gradually narrow 
the gap between the interior and the coastal regions. They 
consider this beneficial to the overall situation. 
  Jin Xin, director of the State Administration of Taxation, 
said that the "tax-sharing system" would be implemented 
gradually. He predicted that it would take five or up to the 
end of this century to attain the target of raising the 
proportion of the central financial revenues to over 60 percent 
of the country's total financial revenues.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Top Official Urges Revamp of </F>
Light Industry"] 
  [Text] Light industries should review production this year 
to better meet market demands, a top industry official said 
yesterday. 
  For the Chinese people's improved standard of living has 
prompted greater demand for varied, high quality products, Yu 
Zhen, Chairman of China National Council of Light Industry, said 
in Beijing. 
  When China re-enters the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), light industries will have to make more and better 
products to meet the challenge of the world market, Yu said. 
  He also called for increased growth to secure supplies of 
daily consumer goods. 
  Yu vowed to seek further overseas technology and capital to 
help the industry meet its targets. 
  And he predicted increased demand for wallpaper, paint and 
household fittings, air conditioners, health-care products and 
food, particularly new products in fancy packages. 
  Yu also pledged to grant import and export licences to more 
companies likely to make money from foreign trade. 
  But he stressed that quality products rather than access to 
the market would make firms successful. 
  Yu expected output from light industries would rise 15 
percent this year to 506 billion yuan ($58 blllion), compared to 
397.1 billion yuan ($46 billion) in the first 11 months of 1992. 
  The industry plans to develop more than 800 new products 
this 
year which Yu hoped would make up 20 percent of the industry's 
total output. 
  He also called for a 15 percent increase in exports this 
year 
taking them over $34.5 billion. Exports from January to 
November last year were $20.1 billion. 
  This goal should be easier to attain following the 
unification of the foreign exchange rate. 
  Yu urged the industry to cut debt ridden enterprises by 5 
percent and ensure 90 percent of its surveyed consumer goods 
meet quality standards. 
  Last year, a third of the country's light industrial 
enterprises were running in the red, a proportion similar to the 
country's overall industrial situation. 
  The industry's production-sales rate should reach 96 percent 
this year compared with 95.08 percent a year ago, Yu added. 
  The China National Council of Light Industry will double its 
effort this year to co-ordinate and guide enterprise's 
production without direct involvement in their management and 
daily operations, he said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Imports Fuel Record Rise in </F>
'93 Tariff Earnings"] 
  [Text] A rise in imports and tighter customs inspections 
caused tariff revenue to hit a record 25.9 billion yuan ($2.98 
billion) last year, statistics said. 
  The income was a 20 percent rise over 1992, according to 
statistics released yesterday by Chinese customs authorities. 
  Officials from the Customs General Administration (CGA) [as 
published] attributed the sharp growth in tariff income to 
booming trade, China's rapidly developing national economy and a 
change in the composition of imports. 
  China's soaring domestic demand for imports was the major 
factor behind the rise in import tariffs, they said, adding 
that, excluding international aid and donations, China's imports 
of general merchandise last year rose 25.2 percent over l992. 
  For example, steel imports rose to 30.34 million tons, up 
327 
percent over 1992; processed oil imports 17.48 million tons, up 
128 percent; imports of automobiles or wheelbases by 310,000 
units, up 47 percent; and imports of aircraft 129 units, up 79 
percent. 
  There was also a marked increase in the imports of Hi-Fi and 
TV sets from Japan and other developed countries as well as cars 
from the CIS republics. 
  The officials also attributed the rise to CGA measures last 
year to improve customs inspections on imported goods and its 
crackdown on fake goods. 
  Last year, import duties rose 19.58 percent over 1992 to 
reach 25.62 billion yuan ($2.94 billion), while export duties 
grew by 32.11 percent to hit 260 million yuan ($29.9 million). 
  During the past year, customs officials also collected 18.82 
billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in value-added taxes on imported 
goods an increase of 13.2 percent over 1992.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Wu 
Jiahuang, director of Customs Duty Department of the Chinese 
General Administration of Customs, pointed out today that 
lowering import duties is required by China's efforts to 
introduce a socialist market economy. In future, China's import 
duties will continue to fall gradually each year until they come 
to a rationally low level. Current duty deductions and remission 
policies will also be adjusted accordingly starting this year. 
  It has been learned that China will lower import duties on 
2,898 commodities this year. Last year, import duties on 3,371 
commodities were lowered. These two measures have brought down 
China's overall import duty rate by 15 percent. 
  At the moment, China's duty rate is 36.4 percent, 8.8 
percent 
lower than last year. 
  At an international economic and trade situation seminar, 
co- 
sponsored by the International Economic Information and 
Development Center of the ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE and the publisher 
of GUOJI JINGMAO BAO [INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND TRADE POST], 
Wu Jiahuang said: In the past, when China's duty rate was 
relatively high, many duty deduction and remission policies were 
introduced, which contributed much to reform, opening up, and 
the absorption of foreign capital. 
  According to statistics, by the end of last year, China had 
utilized a total of $21 billion in loans from foreign 
governments and international organizations. Goods and 
materials imported under the many credit projects were duty 
free. Last year, equipment imported duty free for wholly and 
partially foreign-funded enterprises in China was worth $16.6 
billion. 
  Wu Jiahuang pointed out: Duty deduction and remission 
policies are now more and more out of tune with the situation as 
China's reform and opening up moves ahead. They have caused 
problems such as regions and trades competing with each other in 
a negative way and have become an obstacle to fair competition. 
  Wu revealed that starting this year, according to the 
principle of nondiscrimination and fair treatment, China will 
gradually adjust its duty deduction and remission policies and a 
number will be canceled.

will be calculated starting from 25 January 1994. The principal 
and interest will be paid on a lump-sum basis on 25 July 1994. 
The annual interest rate for the one-year-maturity nonphysical 
treasury bill will be 11.98 percent, and its interest will be 
calculated starting from 7 February 1994. The principal and 
interest will be paid on a lump-sum basis on 7 February 1995. 
After the issuance of the six-month-maturity and 
one-year-maturity nonphysical treasury bills ends, these 
nonphysical treasury bills may be transferred through the 
Shanghai Securities Exchange Market. 
  The issuance of nonphysical treasury bills means that the 
state will not adopt the method of printing treasury bills, and 
that the selling and buying will be done through record keeping 
carried out over computers. In other words, paper will not be 
used in the issuance of nonphysical treasury bills. 
  The nonphysical treasury bills will be sold on consignment 
by 
nonpolicy banks, securities companies, trust and investment 
companies, and other nonbanking financial organizations. The 
registration and clearing of transactions will be done through 
the computer network of the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market. 
  Various securities and financial organizations which have 
established business links with the Shanghai Securities Exchange 
Market may, starting today, file applications for the 
consignment of the six-month-maturity and one-year-maturity 
nonphysical treasury bills to the State Debts Administration of 
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Treasury Department of 
the People's Bank of China. Financial organizations which are 
not in a position to handle nationwide consignment but which 
possess the conditions to utilize the Shanghai Securities 
Exchange Market's network for transactions may act as sales 
agents and take part in the marketing of nonphysical treasury 
bills or buy nonphysical treasury bills from securities 
companies on behalf of investors. 
  The nonphysical treasury bills will be mainly consigned to 
and purchased by banks and other financial organizations. 
Enterprises and business undertakings and individual investors 
who purchase more than 10,000 yuan of nonphysical treasury bills 
may open transaction accounts with distributors (mainly 
securities organizations which have transaction space at the 
Shanghai Securities Exchange Market). Various investors who 
already have stock exchange accounts with the Shanghai 
Securities Exchange Market through securities organizations may 
use their original accounts to purchase nonphysical treasury 
bills. 
  It was also learned from the Shanghai Securities Exchange 
Market that to promote the issuance of nonphysical treasury 
bills, further simplify procedures, increase efficiency, expand 
sales, and provide convenience for investors, the Shanghai 
Securities Exchange Market has formulated plans for nominal 
quotations and the distribution of nonphysical treasury bills by 
agents. The distributors, after purchasing nonphysical treasury 
bills from the Ministry of Finance, may post nominal quotations 
within a prescribed period and act as sales agents. 
Stockbrokers who have space in the securities exchange market 
may use their own funds or act as agents for their customers to 
submit purchasing slips and buy nonphysical treasury bills 
through a selected underwriter [cheng xiao shang 2110 6906 
0794]. The declared value [shen bao jia ge 3947 1032 0116 2706] 
should be the unified issue price of the treasury bills. 
  The nonimal quotations for the six-month-maturity 
nonphysical 
treasury bills will be posted for seven days at the Shanghai 
Securities Exchange Market starting on 24 January. Various 
brokers may start to do business with investors from the date 
that the nominal quotations are posted until the formal 
announcement of listings for transactions by the Ministry of 
Finance. 
  A responsible person at the Ministry of Finance pointed out 
that the reform of the method of issuing treasury bills seeks to 
meet the needs of the market economy and to promote the 
marketability of treasury bills. He expressed his hope that 
various securities organizations would strengthen the training 
of staff members, do a good job of publicizing the method, help 
various units and individual investors understand the investment 
procedures for nonphysical treasury bills, and facilitate their 
purchase. 
  According to this responsible person, to satisfy the demand 
of individual small investors who want to buy treasury bills, 
the state will issue some physical treasury bills (namely in a 
printed form) within this year. The sales and purchasing 
methods are same as in previous years. The interest rate for 
physical treasury bills will be to a certain extent higher than 
that for bank savings accounts during the same period.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Jan 16 (XINHUA) -- National meetings of 
branch directors of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 
[ICBC], Agricultural Bank of China [ABC], Bank of China [BOC], 
People's Construction Bank of China [PCBC], and the 
Communications Bank of China [CBC] concluded here today. It was 
agreed unanimously that the banks should firmly implement the 
monetary and credit policy of the People's Bank of China as well 
as the measures for macroeconomic regulation and control, put 
the national interest first, strictly abide by financial 
discipline, and enforce all orders and prohibitions in order to 
execute work in the banking sector well in 1994. 
  The national meetings of branch directors of the five banks 
began in Beijing on 12 January. During the meetings, the 
various banks outlined their reform measures and operational 
plans for 1994. 
  Zhang Xiao, president of the ICBC, noted: The guiding 
principle and tasks of the ICBC for 1994 are to conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council's decision on 
reforming the banking structure, vigorously expand sources of 
capital, exercise strict control over credit volume, intensify 
reform of internal mechanisms, make continued efforts to 
consolidate order in the banking sector, create conditions for 
gradually changing itself into a state-owned commercial bank, 
and promote a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the 
national economy. 
  Zhang Xiao pointed out: In transforming itself from a 
specialized bank into a commercial bank, the bank must first of 
all engage in the management of the proportions of assets and 
liabilities, and in risk management of assets. For this reason, 
starting from this year, the ICBC will implement across the 
board the management of the proportions of assets and 
liabilities under the management of lending limits. The bank 
will appraise -- in terms of total volume, turnover, security, 
and efficiency -- such indexes as the abundance rate of capital, 
the deposits-lending ratio, the turnover rate of assets, the 
quality of lending, the profit rate of assets, and so forth. 
There will also be an incremental switch from evaluating the 
volume of increase to evaluating the balance. Meanwhile, we 
will set up a risk safeguard mechanism, mechanisms for 
separating policy lending and commercial lending, mechanisms for 
allocating sectorial funds, and a new mechanism for foreign 
exchange operations. 
  Ma Yongwei, president of the ABC, said: The principal tasks 
for banks in rural areas are as follows: Strictly control the 
volume of credit, expand the sources of funds, rationalize the 
credit structure, and increase input in agriculture; steadily 
implement reform of the rural banking structure; make continued 
efforts to consolidate order in the banking sector, step up 
infrastructure construction, strengthen internal management, and 
further improve economic efficiency; and persist in the policy 
of giving equal emphasis on two fronts and doing well in both, 
and raise the quality of cadres. Ma Yongwei noted: This year 
we must truly increase agricultural lending. The increase in 
agricultural loans, which accounted for 6 percent of the total 
increase of ABC's lending last year, should be raised to 10 
percent this year. In setting lending priority, we should -- 
while persisting in operating under the guidance of market 
forces and emphasizing efficiency and technological upgrading -- 
help accelerate the readjustment of the structure of agriculture 
and the mix of agricultural products and develop, on a priority 
basis, a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater and 
better yields. Meanwhile, we should lend active support to 
village and township enterprises to help them improve efficiency 
and grow in a steady and sound manner; and we will also promote 
development of the rural market and enliven commodity 
circulation in rural areas. 
  Speaking of the general goals of the rural banking reform 
set to start step by step this year, Ma Yongwei said: We will, 
by way of reform, develop a rural banking system whereby the 
Agricultural Development Bank of China [ADBC], the ABC, and 
rural credit cooperatives will be closely integrated and develop 
through coordination. Under this new system, the newly founded 
ADBC will handle strictly defined agricultural policy-lending 
business, the ABC will gradually shift toward the operating 
mechanism of a commercial bank, and the rural credit 
cooperatives will be gradually "disjoined" from the ADBC and, if 
needed, form an agricultural cooperative bank in a well-planned 
manner. 
  Wang Qiren, chairman of the BOC board of directors, outlined 
the BOC's principal tasks for 1994 as follows: Intensify 
banking reform and change the mechanisms step by step; persist 
in steady operations and constantly increase the bank's 
resources; and improve scientific management and enforce strict 
management discipline. He emphasized: a new system of foreign 
exchange administration has been put into effect this year. The 
banks should conscientiously carry out foreign exchange selling 
and buying business, improve management of foreign exchange 
accounts, and improve customer service. We should institute and 
improve a system of listed exchange rates for the entire banking 
sector under which the head office is responsible for setting a 
unified exchange rate and the floating range, to ensure all 
branches follow a uniform rate. Meanwhile, we should manage the 
banks according to law and actively cultivate and develop a 
foreign exchange market. 
  Wang Qiren said: In changing itself into a commercial bank 
this year, the BOC will focus primarily on setting up a renminbi 
fund management system characterized by unified regulation and 
control and division of responsibility among different levels, 
engage in the management of the proportions of assets and 
liabilities and in risk management of assets; separate 
policy-lending banking from commercial banking; and make active 
but steady efforts for entry into the monetary market. 
  Zhou Daojiong, president of the PCBC, said: A major 
component of the reform of China's banking sector in 1994 will 
be the establishment of the proposed National Development Bank 
[NDB] to provide policy support for key state projects, and 
handle lending and discounting [tie xi 6317 1873] business. 
PCBC will drop policy-lending that has been part of its 
business. Consequently, there will be a number of changes in 
PCBC's business: First, in connection with the operational 
readjustment and division of responsibility, PCBC will not 
directly handle policy-lending any more. Instead, it will be 
commissioned by the NDB to handle policy- lending. Second, by 
changing its managerial mechanism, PCBC will operate as a 
commercial bank; it will gradually implement the management 
principles of independent operation, responsibility for its 
profits and losses, taking risks on its own, and exercising 
self-restraint. Zhou Daojiong pointed out: After shifting 
tracks, the PCBC will focus on long- and medium-term lending. 
  Wang Mingquan, president of the CBC, pointed out that the 
CBC's objective for 1994 is to strive to run a standardized 
commercial bank. He said: In the new year, the CBC will carry 
out a series of reforms of its corporate system, organizational 
structure, motivational mechanism, distribution system, and so 
on. We will put the stress of business development in urban 
centers and economically developed regions, and further improve 
our internal operational mechanisms. We will ensure fluidity, 
safety, and profitability of banking assets, increase the value 
of assets and profits, and optimize our structure. The reforms 
will mainly deal with standardizing the CBC's share-holding 
system and perfecting its corporate system; persisting in 
comprehensive operation with business managed by specialized 
departments, strengthening the CBC's comprehensive service 
functions, conforming to the new supervisory procedures of the 
central bank, and establishing a system of appraisal for 
internal performance; gradually enhancing the head office's fund 
control ability and operational functions, and improving the 
organizational management system; actively seeking business 
development abroad and constantly raising the CBC's 
international status; and promoting the personnel system of a 
commercial bank, and improving the motivational mechanism and 
distribution system for employees.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- A program for 
improving coal-use efficiency and the environment, jointly 
carried out by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and 
the Chinese Government, has been progressing smoothly since its 
implementation in 1992. 
  Yuan Shaofu, deputy director of China International Center 
for Economic and Technical Exchange (CICETE), which is in charge 
of implementation of the program, said that after more than a 
year of effort, the program has achieved prominent results in 
various aspects. 
  He said that the aim of the program is to support the 
Chinese 
Government in exploiting coal resources efficiently by spreading 
or developing technologies and equipment concerning the 
production or use of coal. Research, design, manufacturing, 
transportation and some other aspects of the program can help 
raise the efficiency of coal exploitation, cut down on 
environmental pollution and promote the health and safety of the 
people. 
  A key point of the program is to raise China's capability in 
using some critical technologies for coal production, he added. 
  Yuan said the budget for the program is 17 million U.S. 
dollars, of which UNDP will put in eight million U.S. dollars, 
while the Chinese Government is responsible for nine million 
U.S. dollars. 
  Specifically, the program involves recovery and utilization 
of chemicals from coking, circulating fluidized bed combustion 
technology, control of atmospheric pollution from coal 
combustion, exploration for deep coalbed methane as well as 
other aspects. 
  Concerted efforts by UNDP and CICETE in the past year have 
resulted in varying degrees of progress in these aspects, Yuan 
said. 
  China is the world's biggest coal producer. By the end of 
the century its annual coal output will reach 1.4 billion tons. 
Presently coal constitutes 74 percent of China's total energy 
output, while it makes up 76 percent of total energy consumption. 
  Forecasts show that by the end of this century coal will 
still constitute 70 percent of China's total energy demand.

<F P=106> [By Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "1993 State Plan for </F>
Production of Petroleum, Natural Gas Overfulfilled"] 
  [Text] Our country's onshore petroleum industry is facing 
greater difficulties in prospecting and tapping, potential 
resources to be tapped are decreasing, and construction funds 
are insufficient. In such circumstances, China's oil industry 
continues to maintain a stable growth momentum. In 1993, 
production of crude oil and natural gas exceeded planned targets 
laid down by the state: Crude oil output reached 139.2 million 
tonnes, or increased by 1.04 million tonnes over the previous 
year, and this marked the largest increase in output over one 
year. Natural gas output reached 15.4 cubic meters, an increase 
of 200 million cubic meters over the previous year, which were 
101.2 percent and 101.3 percent respectively of the state's 
planned targets. 
  At present, various oil fields in the east of the country 
are 
still experiencing a period of difficult development, the 
average comprehensive water content stands above 79 percent, and 
the annual fall in output is about 21 million tonnes. On the 
one hand, the China National Petroleum Corporation will continue 
to adopt advanced technology, will pay attention to the 
reasonable adjustment of exploitation, and try by every possible 
means to lower the overall rate of decrease and the natural rate 
of decrease. On the other hand, through the in-depth 
implementation of the Regulations on Enterprise Reform, it will 
adjust the production contract policy for the last three years 
of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period so that reform may promote 
further the development of production. 
  Since last year, promoted by reforms, various oil fields 
have 
made efforts to increase oil output by overcoming difficulties. 
Oil fields in the east have actively carried out measures to 
"stabilize output through water control." Last year, Daqing Oil 
Field produced 55.9 million tonnes of crude oil, and increased 
output by 244,000 tonnes over the previous year. It has 
stabilized its output at a level above 50 million tonnes for 18 
consecutive years. Oil fields in the west also increased crude 
oil output by 1.739 million tonnes, although there was a 
shortage of transport facilities. 
  In 1993, the oil and gas prospecting situation of our 
country's onshore petroleum industry also maintained a rising 
trend. Geological oil and gas reserves discovered and verified 
exceeded planned state targets by 22 percent and 44 percent 
respectively. Total discovered reserves continued to increase.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Rui (5618 3843): "Railway Minister Han </F>
Shubei Says That Railway Operation Must Be Adapted to the Market 
Economy"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At today's 
national railway leading cadre work conference, Han Shubin, 
minister of railways, pointed out that it is necessary to change 
the idea that railway operations cannot follow the course of the 
market economy because railways are state infrastructural 
facilities and are closely related to public benefit and because 
there is a serious shortage of transportation facilities. He 
pointed out that railway operation must also be adapted to the 
market economy, and the change must be made resolutely. 
  Han Shubin reminded railway personnel throughout the country 
to clearly notice the current difficulties: Railway 
transportation is in serious short supply, and is far from 
meeting the needs of rapid development of the national economy. 
The railway system is operating in a difficult condition, and 
the whole trade is running in the red. The shortage of 
construction funds is increasing, and this seriously constrains 
railway development. The foundation for industrial safety is 
not solid enough, and there remain a lot of hidden perils. 
  He said: The basic industrial attributes of the railway 
system and the short transportation capacity also make it harder 
to change the management and operation structure. However, if 
the railway system does not carry out in-depth reform and does 
not move into the market economy, it will encounter even greater 
difficulties. In 1994, the Ministry of Railways will focus the 
reform on the measures of adopting the corporate system on a 
trial basis, transforming the government institution functions, 
promoting railway construction joint ventures, and expanding the 
scope of opening up. 
  Han Shubin pointed out: The adoption of the corporate system 
should proceed according to the characteristics of this trade. 
The main forms should be sole corporations and 
limited-liability corporations. This year, the Fuzhou Railway 
Subbureau will start the pilot scheme for reorganizing itself 
into a corporation; the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Corporation 
will carry out the pilot scheme for adopting the joint-stock 
system, and arrangements will be made to list its shares on 
stock exchanges; the pilot scheme for adopting the joint-stock 
system will also be carried out intensively in the Nanning 
Railway Corporation, and will be extended to the whole of the 
Liuzhou Railway Bureau if conditions are ripe. 
  Han Shubin stressed the need to grasp the opportunity as 
international capital is interested in investing in China's 
railway construction, and called for further opening up this 
aspect. When expanding the use of government-arranged foreign 
loans, the railway system should also make efforts to attract 
more direct foreign investments and to set up more cooperative 
production projects. 
  Han Shubin mentioned, for the first time, the need to make 
full use of Hong Kong's role as an international financial and 
entrepot trade center and to develop the railway system's 
operation in Hong Kong. At the same time, it is necessary to 
increase economic exchanges with neighboring countries and 
regions, greatly develop international coordinated transport, 
especially transport across the continental bridge and by 
container transport, and encourage the exportation of railway 
products, labor services, and technologies. 
  It is learned that in 1994, China's investment in railway 
construction will be 29 billion yuan. There will be seven key 
construction projects, namely, the Beijing-Kowloon railway, the 
Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway, the Baoji-Zhongwei railway, the Houma- 
Yueshan railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway, the 
Nanning-Kunming railway, and the West Beijing Station. In the 
whole year, 2,100 kilometers of new railway lines will be laid; 
and 1,335 kilometers of railway lines will be turned into 
double-track lines. 
  In 1994, the railway transportation plan will arrange the 
transport of 1.56 billion tonnes of freight and the transport of 
640 million tonnes of coal. When formulating these targets, the 
authorities gave consideration to the fact that the additional 
capacity of railway transport will not be large, the 
reconstruction projects along some existing railway lines may 
affect the railway operation to a larger extent, the size of 
capital construction in the whole country will be cut down 
appropriately, the market demand for coal transport will change, 
and passenger transport demand will increase. 
  Reportedly, railway development will be facing a serious 
shortage of funds in 1994. The railway system will operate in 
the red and the business deficit will amount to 7 billion yuan.

Commission: "Fully Implement the Agricultural Program, Achieve 
the Goal of Agricultural Development"] 
  [Text] The State Council has recently formulated and 
published "China's Program for Agricultural Development for the 
1990's." This program bears two distinct characteristics: 
First, it gives full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as its 
guidance and to the principles and policies set by the Central 
Committee and the State Council for deepening rural reform and 
attaching importance to and supporting agricultural development. 
Second, it makes an overall plan for national agricultural 
development with stress on developing productive forces. In 
light of the demand for setting up a socialist market economy at 
a greater pace, it clearly defines the ideological guidance, 
objectives, and specific tasks of developing agricultural 
production, so it will serve as an important guide in our 
efforts to improve our capacity in comprehensive agricultural 
production and to elevate our agricultural production to a new 
level and will prove highly operational. Agricultural and rural 
economic development involves many quarters and requires great 
attention by the whole party, and powerful and coordinated 
support by all departments concerned. In carrying out the 
program, it is necessary to focus on and make a success of the 
following six tasks: 
  1. Under the new situation of setting up a socialist 
market economy, to meet the party Central Committee and the 
State Council's demands, it is necessary to firmly carry out the 
principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of our 
economy, putting agriculture in the first place of our economic 
work. This is the prerequisite for ensuring overall 
implementation of the program. Agriculture serves as the 
foundation of economic development, social stability, and 
national independence. This is the scientific summation of our 
experience in economic construction over the last several 
decades and a fundamental principle we must always uphold in 
economic work. As compared with the 1980's, our present tasks of 
developing agricultural production are more arduous. 
Agricultural production will need not only to meet the demands 
of the people's relatively comfortable life and of accelerated 
economic development in terms of quantity, quality, and variety, 
but also to create favorable conditions for economic development 
in the next century. In light of these requirements, the 
program sets principal targets to be attained in rural economic 
development by 2000. These targets were based on the results of 
overall balance and repeated calculations. They are fundamental 
targets which must be hit and also serve as conditions for 
attaining the strategic objectives for national and social 
development in 2000. It is possible for us to attain these 
targets as scheduled but it also involves considerable 
difficulties. Therefore, we must not be content with issuing 
general calls for action, instead, we must truly putting 
agriculture in the first place of our economic work in line with 
the Central Committee and the State Council's demands. 
  We must not be satisfied with putting down on paper the 
principle of giving top priority to agriculture or with agreeing 
with it in words, but must really carry it out in our economic 
work. Just as General Secretary Jiang Zemin said at the 
national rural work conference held last year: "It is necessary 
to strengthen agriculture, which serves as the foundation of our 
economy, truly rather than superficially, in deeds rather than 
in words, and whole- heartedly rather than half-heartedly." 
  2. While enabling the market mechanism to play a 
leading role in allocation of agricultural resources, we must 
attach great importance to macro guidance for agricultural 
development and accelerate adjustment of agricultural structure 
and layout in an appropriate way so that agricultural 
development will meet the demands of national economic 
development. 
  Grain and cotton are necessities for the people's life. 
Whether there is a steady development of grain and cotton 
production has a great bearing on the overall situation. As 
compared with production in other fields, grain and cotton 
production, grain production in particular, have greater social 
effect but lower economic efficiency. Over the last few years 
some regions excessively reduced the area sown to grain and 
cotton during economic restructuring. The Central Committee and 
the State Council have accorded considerable attention to this 
problem and have formulated a series of policies to promote 
grain and cotton production. To ensure a steady development of 
grain and cotton production, it is essential to pay attention to 
the following points: 1) If the yield per-unit area is not 
raised by a big margin, the area sown to grain and cotton should 
basically remain unchanged. Given our present capacity in 
comprehensive agricultural production, at least 1.65 million mu 
of land should be planted with grain and 900 million mu with 
cotton nationwide, and these two figures should be treated as 
security lines. If the total areas under grain and cotton are 
smaller than these figures, timely measures against the tendency 
must be taken. 2) National grain production and marketing 
should follow the principle that each province (autonomous 
region) should be more than self-sufficient or basically 
self-sufficient in grain and should transfer grain to or from 
nearby areas. By the end of this century, most provinces 
(autonomous regions) must be basically self-sufficient in grain. 
A few provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) which 
have to transfer grain from other areas must establish long-term 
relationships with nearby provinces with superfluous grain, in 
terms of grain production and sales. 3) Continued efforts 
should be made to set up marketable grain and cotton bases in 
areas with great production potential to stabilize the overall 
situation. 4) The greatest possible number of grain- and 
cotton-producing areas should be helped to develop a diversified 
economy to put an end to the situation in which "some counties 
are big ones in terms of grain and cotton production, small ones 
in terms of industrial production, and poor ones in terms of 
financial status." The central government has decided to make 
concentrated efforts to support 500 select counties producing a 
great amount of marketable grain and 150 select counties 
producing a great amount of quality cotton by providing special 
loans and appropriately increasing investment in infrastructure. 
From now on, governments in all localities should try their 
best to support grain- and cotton-producing areas in their 
efforts to increase production and develop the economy. 
  3. While persisting in developing agricultural 
production, we should ensure a constant increase in peasants' 
income so as to arouse their enthusiasm for production. 
The peasants play a decisive role in agricultural production so 
we must arouse their enthusiasm for production to stabilize 
agricultural production. To enable the majority of the peasants 
to live a relatively comfortable life by the year 2000, we must 
ensure that the peasants' per-capita net income will increase by 
at least 5.8 percent annually. What merits our attention is: 
Despite rapid growth in agricultural production and the rural 
economy over the last few years, the peasants' actual income has 
gone up slowly, resulting in a greater income gap between 
residents in rural and urban areas. If things go on like this, 
the peasants' enthusiasm and rural stability will be affected. 
Therefore, we must guarantee a steady increase in peasants' 
income, regarding this as an important measure to stabilize 
agricultural production and the rural situation and to attain 
the objectives for agricultural development set for 2000. One, 
while stabilizing principal agricultural products including 
grain and cotton, vigorous efforts should be made to develop a 
diversified economy, including the breeding industry, and 
enterprises engaged in processing mainly agricultural and 
sideline products, in a bid to extend agricultural production 
links and to add value to farm produce. Two, the peasants 
should be encouraged to develop a highly efficient agriculture 
that provides greater and better yields in accordance with 
market needs. 
  To develop a highly efficient type of farming that provides 
greater and better yields, the central government has decided to 
set up a number of relevant demonstration zones with different 
characteristics in different areas in a planned way, supplying 
them with technology, funds, materials, and other essential 
factors of production. The project is also designed for 
in-depth development of agricultural products in terms of 
variety and quality. Various localities can follow this example 
by setting up their own demonstration zones. Three, it is 
essential to continue developing township enterprises and the 
tertiary industry in rural areas to increase employment 
opportunities for surplus rural labor. At present, there is a 
total of 100 million unemployed peasants throughout the country 
and this figure will increase to 200 million by the year 2000, 
so the situation with employment in rural areas is desperate. 
If we can create new outlets for surplus labor on the land, we 
will greatly increase the productivity of agricultural labor and 
peasants' income. It is essential to attach importance to 
economic development in central and western regions. After 
making an additional special loan of 5 billion yuan to support 
the development of township enterprises in central and western 
regions in 1993, the state has decided to increase the same loan 
every year from 1994 on to support the development of township 
enterprises across the country. All localities should try their 
best to provide technology, funds, and materials to support the 
development of township enterprises. Four, further effective 
measures should be taken to lighten the peasants' burden and to 
protect agricultural production. The price increase of farming 
means should be controlled and the prices of farm produce 
adjusted in line with the gap between the prices of industrial 
and agricultural products. A grain relief fund for natural 
disasters should be set up, prices set for major farm products 
to protect the interests of the farmers, and measures taken to 
ensure the peasants will benefit from state policies to the 
full. Again, laws and regulations and a mechanism for 
protecting the peasants' interests should be set up. Five, poor 
areas should be further helped to shake off poverty and to boost 
economic development. The state has set about making a plan, 
under which 80 million poor people will shake off poverty within 
seven years beginning 1994. 
  4. We must make concentrated efforts to promote 
agricultural education and scientific and technological progress 
so as to elevate the overall quality of agriculture and rural 
economic development to a new level. We must mainly rely 
upon increasing per-unit output to hit the target for 
agricultural growth for the 1990's, raising the per-mu yields of 
grain and cotton by 50 and 12 km respectively within 10 years, 
which nears the growth rate in the 1980's. To achieve this, we 
must promote scientific and technological progress and improve 
conditions for agricultural production. In the next few years, 
while continuing to promote basic agricultural scientific 
research, we must vigorously spread the use of scientific 
research achievements which have proved remarkably effective in 
raising per- unit yield and quality of agricultural products. 
First, we should select, cultivate, and spread improved strains 
of crops, timber, animals, poultry, and aquatic products. The 
plan for using strains related to grain and cotton production 
nationwide should be updated once or twice in the 1990's and the 
good strains of animals, poultry, aquatic products, 
sugar-yielding bearing crops, timber, and fruits should be 
spread to a wider area than they are now. 
  Second, appropriate agricultural technology should be 
vigorously popularized. The growing industry should focus on 
spreading such technologies as extensive model cultivation 
[guang mo shi hua zhai pei 1639 2875 1709 0553 2707 1014], dry 
agriculture [han zhuo nong ye 2487 0155 6593 2814], plastic film 
sheeting, soil conservation cultivation [bao hu di zhai pei 0202 
6233 0966 2707 1014], and forecast and comprehensive prevention 
and elimination of damage done by plant diseases, pests, rats, 
and weeds. The breeding industry should focus on popularizing 
such technologies as optimized rearing of animals and poultry; 
mixed feed; plant stem ammonification; efficient breeding in 
fresh and sea water; resources proliferation [zi yuan zeng zhi 
6327 3293 1073 2994]; and prevention, control, and elimination 
of epidemic diseases. Efforts should also be made to spread the 
advanced technologies of keeping fresh, processing, preserving, 
and shipping agricultural products. By the year 2000, 50 
percent of agricultural scientific research achievements should 
be transformed into actual productive forces. Third, such 
water-efficient irrigation technologies as piped water supply 
[guan dao shu shui 4619 6670 6551 3055], irrigation canal lining 
[qu dao chen qi 3255 6670 6000 4265], antiseepage [fang shen 
7089 3334], spray irrigation, and drip irrigation should be 
spread in line with actual conditions to gradually raise the 
utilization ratio of irrigation water to 50 percent from the 
present 40 percent. Fourth, scientific methods of applying 
fertilizers and pesticides should be popularized to raise the 
utilization ratio of fertilizers and to bring about better 
results in preventing, controlling, and eliminating plant 
diseases and pests. And fifth, farming technique should be 
improved in line with local conditions to raise the multiple 
crop index. By the year 2000, the national multiple crop index 
should reach 160 percent, 10 percent over that in the late 
1980's. 
  5. It is necessary to further promote comprehensive 
agricultural development to tap agricultural production 
potential. The government has decided to further 
nationwide comprehensive agricultural development in a planned 
way and clearly set the tasks for nationwide comprehensive 
agricultural development through the year 2000. All development 
zones have decided on their own focal points of work. The 
central government has continued to stabilize and improve the 
policies for comprehensive agricultural development as follows: 
The additional grain output brought about by upgrading farmland 
that formerly provided only low and medium yields and grain 
produced on newly reclaimed land are not subject to state 
purchase within five years. Newly reclaimed land is exempt from 
taxes within five years, the state will provide loans with 
discount interest to agricultural development zones, the state 
will build more major water conservancy projects, and the state 
will grant preferential treatment to agricultural development 
zones in distributing farming means including diesel oil, 
chemical fertilizers, and insecticides. All localities must 
conscientiously implement these policies to speed up 
comprehensive agricultural development. 
  6. Vigorous efforts should be made to build more 
projects supporting agricultural production so that fundamental 
conditions for agricultural production will be improved and 
greater power for sustained agricultural development will be 
built up. Projects supporting agricultural production 
provide guarantees for steady agricultural development. To hit 
the target for agricultural expansion, we must build more 
supportive projects. The supportive projects comprise three 
major parts: One, fundamental facilities for agricultural 
production including mainly water conservancy projects and 
projects guaranteeing stable and high yields. Two, industries 
supporting agricultural production which mainly include 
enterprises producing chemical fertilizers, farming machines, 
farm- oriented plastic film, feed, pesticides, and vaccines and 
medicines for animals and poultry against diseases. Three, a 
socialized service system providing weather forecasts, technical 
advisory service, and information about rural finance; farming 
materials; purchasing and marketing of agricultural products; 
storage, transportation, and processing of agricultural 
products; and others. 
  To attain the fundamental targets for the development of 
agricultural production and the rural economy set by the 
program, governments at all levels must strengthen leadership 
over agricultural production and rural work. They should also 
formulate and carry out their own plans for implementing the 
program in line with the spirit of the "Decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, with the 
guidelines laid down by the national rural work conference held 
by the central authorities not long ago, and with actual local 
conditions. Various departments under the State Council must 
make concerted efforts to ensure that the targets for 
agricultural development for the 1990's will be attained.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- About one-tenth of 
China's rural towns have become relatively well off as a result 
of intensified reforms in the countryside, according to the 
latest statistics. 
  The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said in a release today 
that 4,989 towns out of a total of over 50,000 have registered 
an agricultural and industrial output value of more than 100 
million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars) each. 
  Among these towns, called China's "100-million-yuan towns," 
72 enjoyed an output value of more than 1 billion yuan (some 120 
million dollars) and 434 boasted at least 500 million yuan (some 
60 million dollars) in output. 
  The township is China's fundamental governmental unit. The 
mushrooming of comparatively wealthy towns is considered an 
indication of the upgrading of China's rural economy. 
  Statistics show that the "100-million-yuan towns," home to 
20 
percent of China's total rural population, produced half of the 
country's rural output value, and two-thirds of China's rural 
industrial output value. 
  The booming rural industries have been the biggest 
contributors to the development of the wealthy towns, the 
statistics show. In these towns non-agricultural production 
accounted for 88 percent of total output value, about 24 
percentage points higher than the country's average. 
  The output value of township enterprises in these prosperous 
communities made up 52 percent of the country's total. 
  Most of the towns are scattered in the southeastern coastal 
areas, mainly in the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong and 
Zhejiang, where rapid economic growth has taken place over the 
past decade. 
  Experts said this manifested the disparity of economic 
growth 
in different areas in China. However, they said, the most 
encouraging si'nal is that 100-million-yuan towns have sprung up 
in poor areas, especially in the western part of China.

  [Text] High-ranking officials from the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC] stated on Monday [24 January] that regarding the 
meeting between T'ang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei] of the mainland's 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], and 
Taiwan's Chiao Jen-ho of the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] 
scheduled for the end of this month, MAC's feeling is that it 
will be pleased to talk about as much as can be fitted into 
several days of talks. MAC said that even if the talks do not 
result in any agreement, they will not be considered a failure. 
Under the circumstances, MAC officials said they found no 
reasons for Chiao to meet with high-ranking Communist Chinese 
officials. MAC noted that there are varied opinions whether 
Chiao should meet with the head of the mainland's Office of 
Taiwan Affairs. However, many opinions on Taiwan indicate that 
Chiao could face a backlash from the opposition party on Taiwan 
if such a meeting were held.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 26 (CNA) -- Gyalo Thondup, brother of 
exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, said Tuesday [25 
January] that the Dalai Lama hopes a liaison office in Taiwan 
can be set up as soon as possible. 
  Thondup, who arrived here Jan. 18 to attend the Jan. 23 
World 
Freedom Day activities, said that the Dalai Lama hopes such an 
office can help enhance cultural exchanges between Han and 
Tibetan peoples. 
  Thondup, who is visiting at the invitation of the Republic 
of 
China [ROC] Chapter of the World League for Freedom and 
Democracy, made the remarks during a party hosted by the 
Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in his honor. 
  Thondup said he was received warmly by President Li Teng-hui 
and Premier Lien Chan when he first visited Taiwan last May. 
  Thondup added that the Dalai Lama's schedule for 1994 was 
full, but he hoped that he could visit Taiwan soon. 
  Thondup noted that the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile has 
set up liaison offices in Japan, France, Britain, Switzerland 
and the United States in the past few years. 
  Chang Chun-yi, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs 
Commission, said that Thondup's visit worked to break the ice 
and increase understanding between Han and Tibetan peoples.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Taiwan was the top 
investor in Vietnam in 1993 with investment reaching US$430 
million, the Economics Ministry's Industrial Development and 
Investment Center (IDIC) said Thursday [27 January]. 
  In addition to Taiwan investment, a number of Southeast 
Asian 
nations poured money into Vietnam last year, including Malaysia, 
Thailand and Indonesia, who invested US$346 million, US$209 
million and US$131 million respectively, the IDIC statistics 
showed. 
  From 1988 to November, 1993, Taiwan's accumulated investment 
in Vietnam hit US$1.275 billion with Taiwan Sugar Corp. and 
Chinese Petroleum Corp. as leading investors. 
  Hong Kong ranked second in accumulated investment, with 
US$1.064 billion during the period. South Korea came in third 
with US$473 million, followed by Australia's US$415 million and 
Japan's US$414 million. 
  In recent years, foreign capital has continuously poured 
into 
Vietnam due to its cheap labor and the legislation of an 
investment law in 1987 as well as the free market reform policy 
adopted by the Vietnamese Government at the end of the 1980s. 
  The market reform policy, although coming later than similar 
policies in other Southeast Asian countries, still fueled an 
outstanding average economic growth of 7.1 percent over the past 
three years. 
  Total approved foreign investment in Vietnam in 1991 reached 
US$1.146 billion, and the figure jumped to US$2.863 billion in 
1993, the statistics showed. 
  Although Taiwan topped other investors in 1993, its US$430 
million was a decline of 17.8 percent from 1992, the IDIC 
statistics showed. 
  Taiwan manufacturers focused their investments in the hotel, 
tourism, service, petroleum and natural gas industries.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Officials from Taiwan and 
Thailand Thursday [27 January] opened a series of meetings on an 
investment guarantee agreement between the two countries. 
  Ch'en Yung-hsiang, deputy director-general of the Industrial 
Development and Investment Center, is representing Taiwan at the 
negotiations. He said the talks would continue into Friday. 
  The Thai delegation is led by Chaiyong Satjipanon [as 
received], deputy director of the Economic Affairs Department 
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  The 10-member Thai group includes Nopporn Ratchawej, deputy 
director of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei, 
Lek Boonsriroj [as received], chief of the Commercial Division 
of the Thai Office, and officials from the Ministries of 
Agriculture, Industry, Finance, and Transportation. 
  Chaiyong expressed hope that the ongoing talks can reach a 
final agreement. Taiwan and Thailand exchanged a draft proposal 
on the investment guarantee pact last February. 
  Signing of the agreement will certainly boost Taiwan 
investment in Thailand, he noted. 
  Among the six member countries of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations, only Thailand and Brunei have not 
signed the investment guarantee pact with Taiwan. The other 
four members are Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the 
Philippines. 
  Statistics show that Taiwan is the third largest foreign 
investor in Thailand with 1,098 investment projects, totaling 
US$4.5 billion, as of the end of 1993.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 24 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will 
meet the heads of state of five Central and South American 
countries during his trip to Honduras, according to sources with 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Lien, in his capacity as special envoy to President Li 
Teng-hui, is leaving Monday [24 January] afternoon for 
Tegucigalpa to attend the inauguration of Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  Lien will call on outgoing Honduran President Leonardo 
Callejas soon after his arrival at the Honduran capital 
Wednesday and then attend a dinner party hosted by President 
Callejas. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said that during his trip Lien 
will meet with the heads of state from Guatemala, Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Panama and Colombia, and the deputy heads of state 
from Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic as well as the prime 
minister of Belize who are all expected to attend the 
presidential inauguration. 
  In addition, the officials said that the Republic of China 
[ROC] embassy in Tegucigalpa is arranging for formal meetings 
between Premier Lien and the leaders of those countries. 
  They said that although there have been no disputes between 
Taiwan and those countries, Lien's meetings with the leaders 
will still be conducive to enhancing bilateral ties. 
  Diplomatic sources here also attached much importance to 
Lien's trip as Beijing has recently launched a series of 
diplomatic offensives in Central and South America, which 
traditionally are Taiwan diplomatic strongholds. 
  Lien and his delegation will also visit Miami and San 
Francisco before returning home Feb. 1. 
  Lien's delegation includes Vice Foreign Minister Fang 
Chin-yen, Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien and Government 
Information Office Director-General Jason Hu.

  [Text] Asuncion, Jan. 25 (CNA) -- Paraguay will maintain 
diplomatic relations with the Republic of China [ROC] on Taiwan 
although it is developing trade and economic exchanges with 
Mainland China, a well-informed source told the Central News 
Agency Tuesday [25 January]. 
  The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said "It is 
inevitable that Paraguay will establish trade links with the 
mainland under pressure from its business sector." 
  The South American country, however, will definitely not 
sever its official ties with Taiwan. 
  Paraguay Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner 
Tuesday 
made clear his government's stand to a visiting Beijing trade 
mission, the source said. 
  Minister Ramirez last month also explained his government's 
China policy to a parliamentary mission which is scheduled to 
visit Beijing next month. 
  While briefing a group of ranking Paraguay military 
officials 
on his country's foreign policy last week, Ramirez reaffirmed 
Paraguay's diplomatic relations with Taiwan and expressed the 
hope that Taiwan would increase investments in Paraguay. 
  Beijing has recently launched a series of diplomatic 
offensives towards Paraguay, starting with visits to Asuncion by 
a National People's Congress delegation last October and then by 
a trade mission, which is currently in town, in addition to 
inviting the Paraguay mission to visit the mainland. 
  The head of the Beijing trade mission in a closed-door 
meeting with Ramirez said, according to a source present at the 
meeting, that Beijing would increase its purchase of cotton from 
Paraguay and diplomatic ties should eventually be established 
between Beijing and Asuncion. 
  Minister Ramirez told local journalists after the meeting 
that "It is impossible for Paraguay to simultaneously recognize 
two Chinas and it should study how to make a choice in the 
future".

  [Text] China, Laos, Burma, and Thailand held a meeting in 
Kunming yesterday to discuss shipping on the Lancang and Meikong 
rivers and cooperation among them. This meeting is the 
continuation of last year's meeting in Bangkok on exploring 
joint shipping on the Meikong River. The meeting discussed the 
four countries' draft agreement on joint shipping in the upper 
reaches of the Meikong River and eight proposals for stepping up 
development of international shipping on the two rivers. 
  Last night Governor He Zhiqiang and Vice Governor Niu 
Shaoyao 
met representatives of the four countries and invited them to a 
banquet. 
  Governor He Zhiqiang said: Following international economic 
development, particularly Southeast Asian economic development, 
the four countries' governments have put on their agenda the 
issue of navigation on the Lancang and Meikong rivers. These 
countries have reached a consensus on jointly developing the two 
rivers. Since the first meeting in Bangkok in May last year, 
Yunnan has done a great deal of work and fulfilled the duties it 
has undertaken. He Zhiqiang added: I am very happy that the 
second meeting is held in Kunming, and I believe this meeting 
will make a contribution to strengthening the four countries' 
cooperation and promoting navigation on the Lancang and Meikong 
rivers.

<F P=106> [From the "China Radio International Commentary" program by </F>
Lin Shaowen] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has set three major 
goals for his administration in 1994. Fighting crime, promoting 
reemployment, and reforming the country's welfare and health 
care system were the major initiatives included in Clinton's 
State of the Union Address Tuesday [25 January]. 
  President Clinton is determined to tackle key domestic 
problems this year. This is obvious from his spirited one-hour 
speech before the House. He stated these goals will bring on 
renewal for the United States. Clinton asked the Congress to 
set aside partisan differences and pass the top crime bill. 
Clinton demanded increased funding for drug treatment, top 
penalties for those who choose violence, and more stringent 
measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. 
  The United States has seen a rush of street violence, 
something the President calls an American problem. To boost 
crime fighting, Clinton is asking for a new contingent of 
100,000 community police officers. They will patrol the streets 
and allow the veterans to perform more sensitive work. 
  If Congress approves this plan, it could contribute to the 
President's second goal -- increasing employment. Clinton said 
unemployment should be solved along with improving welfare and 
health care. Earlier, he indicated welfare reforms would have 
to wait for the much publicized health care package; but he 
seems to have reserved his stand, stressing that the two must be 
dealt with at once. He explained that better welfare is 
impossible without health care. 
  President Clinton repeated a promise that his government 
would focus on workers' training. He wants to transform 
America's outdated unemployment system into what he called a 
reemployment system. 
  Clinton put forward his health care reform plan last 
September. It features an employer-based system and guarantees 
health insurance for every citizen by 1996. This is something 
former President Richard Nixon promised more than 20 years go 
but never delivered. This time, President Clinton has asked 
Congress to pass the legislation on health care reform. 
  Clinton's State of the Union Address also stresses the 
administration's deficit reduction plan. It supports cutting 
the federal budget deficit by half a trillion dollars in five 
years. 
  Analysts say Clinton's approval rating has been on the rise, 
encouraging him to put forward both new reforms. 
  However, Congress is sure to see a raging debate this year 
on 
the controversial health care package, along with other issues. 
Some congressmen and industrialists claim the new system will 
be unfair. The President is pleading for bipartisan support from 
Congress. The passage of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement has set a precedent for this, and Clinton could very 
well get the green light he is asking for.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Gong Yuzhi [7895 5148 0037] by </F>
staff reporter Gao Lu (7559 6424); date and place not given: 
"From Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] I really did not know how to address Gong Yuzhi! 
He was once deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Mao 
Zedong Works Editing and Publication Committee General Office, 
deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Party Literature 
Research Center, and deputy head of the CPC Central Committee 
Propaganda Department. Currently, he is a member of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, a 
member of the China Association for Science and Technology 
Standing Committee, a concurrent research fellow of the Central 
Party Literature Research Center, a part-time professor at 
Beijing University, and the instructor of a doctoral course. 
Since the content of the interview was confined to academic and 
theoretical areas, let me call him professor! 
  Professor Gong in his early years was committed to research 
on scientific and technological philosophy and scientific and 
technological policy. Later, he engaged himself in research on 
the works of such older generation proletarian revolutionaries 
as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and research on the party's 
current policy theory. His publications in these areas include: 
"Annotations on `The Resolution of Certain Questions in the 
History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic 
of China'" (principal author), "At the Turning Point of 
History," "From New Democracy to the Initial Stage of 
Socialism," "New Starting Point of Ideological Emancipation," 
"New Starting Point in the Study of Mao Zedong Thought," "Under 
the Banner of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics -- Notes on 
Reading Deng Xiaoping's Works," and "An Outline of a New 
Exposition on Mao Zedong Thought" (co-author). 
  On the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, this reporter 
interviewed Gong Yuzhi on the relationship between the great 
men, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, in terms of their thinking 
and theories. 
<H5>  Two Great Men: Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping </H5>
  [Gao] On Mao Zedong's birth centenary, a time to cherish the 
memory of his great contributions, Comrade Mao Zedong's status 
in history has once again become a topic commanding the interest 
of many people. 
  [Gong] Comrade Mao Zedong's status in history should be 
looked at from the broad perspective of China's modern and 
contemporary history. In the 20th century, the great struggle 
of the Chinese nation for liberation and national invigoration 
has produced three great men: Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Deng 
Xiaoping. Sun Yat-sen led the 1911 Revolution and overthrew the 
feudal monarchy; Mao Zedong led the new-democratic revolution, 
founded the PRC, accomplished the transition toward socialism, 
and initiated the great cause of Chinese socialism; and now, 
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we are upholding the 
basic line of "one center, two basic points" and concentrating 
our energies on building a socialist, modernized, and powerful 
country which is prosperous, democratic, and civilized. Sun 
Yat-sen was the pioneer of the democratic revolution. In the 
context of the history of revolution and construction by the 
Chinese people under the leadership of the CPC, there have been 
two great men: Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. 
  [Gao] Does this mean that China's contemporary history and 
our party history can be divided into two chapters: Mao Zedong 
was the lead singer in the first chapter and Deng Xiaoping is 
the lead singer in the second chapter? 
  [Gong] A historical tragedy happened between the first and 
the second chapters, namely, the "Great Cultural Revolution." 
An important contribution Deng Xiaoping made was to safeguard 
Mao Zedong's status in history with a clear-cut stand and 
appraise Mao Zedong Thought in a scientific way, at the crucial 
historical turning point when the 10-year civil turmoil of the 
"Great Cultural Revolution" had ended and the mistake of the 
"Great Cultural Revolution" was denounced and redressed. This 
was an extraordinary thing to do. He required us to be aware of 
the following fact: Mao Zedong was closely bound up with the 
history of the CPC and the history of the Chinese people's 
revolution. Negating the "Great Cultural Revolution" in no way 
means that Mao Zedong should be, or can be, entirely negated. 
Completely negating Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought is 
nothing short of completely negating the history of the CPC and 
the Chinese people's revolution. There are some people abroad 
who entirely negate the history of the CPC and the Chinese 
people's revolution. The influence of this ideological trend is 
present also within the country. Some people not only negate 
the history of China's socialist period but also the history of 
China's democratic revolution; and negate not only the history 
of the CPC and the Chinese revolution led by Mao Zedong but also 
the history of the Chinese revolution led by the Chinese 
Kuomintang and Sun Yat-sen. I heard a young person state at a 
forum that the most promising period for China's modernization 
was during the age of the Empress Dowager Cixi and Yuan Shikai 
and that, unfortunately, the 1911 Revolution messed up China. I 
was really shocked to hear that. 
  [Gao] It seems that you do have some specific reasons for 
naming the three great men, Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Deng 
Xiaoping, from the broad perspective of China's modern and 
contemporary history. 
  [Gong] Comrade Xiaoping said: Without Mao Zedong, we 
probably would still be exploring in the dark. "Mao Zedong 
Thought fostered an entire generation." He put himself in this 
"generation." 
  [Gao] Mao Zedong praised Deng Xiaoping as a "rare talent" 
and spoke highly of him. I heard Mao Zedong once praised 
Comrade Xiaoping more specifically, saying that he was impartial 
and steady in his way of handling things and showed insight when 
tackling problems. Is that true? 
  [Gong] Yes. Mao Zedong made this remark when he was 
recommending Comrade Xiaoping as general secretary. At the 
discussion on the organizational and personnel arrangements for 
the Eighth CPC National Congress, Mao Zedong proposed 
establishing the office of general secretary and recommended 
Comrade Xiaoping to this position. On 13 September 1956, at the 
Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, 
Mao Zedong explained this arrangement. Comrade Xiaoping 
commented that he was quite content with the position of 
secretary general he was holding at the time. Mao Zedong took 
over and said: China's secretary general is equivalent to 
general secretary in other countries. He said: It is a bit 
awkward but let me do some propaganda and, if everybody agrees, 
it will not be awkward. He then praised Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
strong points. 
  [Gao] It is very necessary to do some propaganda on Mao 
Zedong's "propaganda" on Comrade Xiaoping. 
  [Gong] Mao Zedong said: In my opinion, Deng Xiaoping is 
quite an impartial person. Like me, he is not without 
shortcomings but he is relatively impartial. He is relatively 
talented and capable. If you say he does everything well, that 
is not true. He is like me and has done many wrong things and 
said many wrong things. However, comparatively speaking, he is 
capable. He is relatively careful and impartial. He is an 
honest and kind [hou dao 0624 6670] person and not frightening. 
He also said: He said he is not competent but I think he is. 
There will be people who are unsatisfied with him, just as 
there are people who are not satisfied with me. But, on the 
whole, he is relatively attentive to the overall interests, 
relatively honest and kind, relatively impartial when handling 
problems, and he is very strict with himself if he makes a 
mistake. 
  [Gao] Mao Zedong also made many positive comments on other 
leaders but there are not many who got such a high appraisal 
from him. What do you think are the common points between Mao 
Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. 
  [Gong] I think comparing and studying these two great men is 
very meaningful but one cannot do it with only a few words. As 
far as common points are concerned, I think the most significant 
lies in "seeking truth from facts." It is, first of all, due to 
this common point in their ideological approaches that they 
became the cores of the two generations of the central 
leadership collectives, led the two revolutions, achieved the 
two leaps in the integration of Marxism with China's reality, 
and founded two great theories: Mao Zedong Thought and the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  [Gao] This common point is very important and needs an 
extensive analysis. What about other common points? 
  [Gong] As strategists, a big common point with Mao Zedong 
and Deng Xiaoping is their attention to rural areas and the 
peasants. That is, proceeding from solving rural and 
peasant-related issues to solving the problems in China's 
revolution and reform. The revolutionary path of "rural areas 
encircling the cities" initiated by Mao Zedong was a new path, 
different from the revolutionary path followed in the Russian 
Revolution, namely, centering on cities. To establish 
revolutionary bases in rural areas was determined by China's 
national conditions and was a revolutionary path with Chinese 
characteristics. Strategically, and as far as the choice of 
breakthrough point for the reform is concerned, Deng Xiaoping 
also set his eye on rural areas when leading China's reform. 
First, the breakthrough in, and popularization of, the 
peasants' contract responsibility system with remuneration 
linked to output and the new force of township and town 
enterprises suddenly coming to the fore afterward, catalyzed the 
preparation and development of the market economy. In my 
opinion, grasping the issue of rural areas and the peasants in 
China's revolutionary strategy and reform strategy means taking 
hold of China's characteristics. Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping 
both grasped this basic point of strategy. 
  [Gao] Are there any other common points? 
  [Gong] As strategists, Mao Zedong set great store by the 
protracted nature and the imbalance in development of the 
Chinese revolution and Deng Xiaoping also pays close attention 
to the protracted nature and the imbalance in development of the 
Chinese modernization. 
  [Gao] Hoping that China will become rich and powerful as 
soon as possible is also a point shared by Mao Zedong and Deng 
Xiaoping. 
  [Gong] It is also the common point between them and Sun 
Yat-sen and represents the common wish of the Chinese nation. 
<H5>  Two Generations of Central Leadership Collectives </H5>
  [Gao] To my knowledge, the formulation of two-generation 
"central leadership collectives" seemed to have been invented by 
Comrade Xiaoping. Some people think that calling the central 
leadership collective, with Mao Zedong at the core, our party's 
"first-generation central leadership collective" needs some 
explanation. [Gong] That is in terms of the maturity of the 
central leadership. In the history of our party, from the 
founding of the party in 1921 up to the Zunyi Meeting in 1935, 
there were a number of terms of central leadership. In the 
course of exploring the road of Chinese revolution, though the 
earlier central leadership groups scored major pioneering 
achievements and their historic significance cannot be 
obliterated, they were not mature in terms of both revolutionary 
theory and revolutionary practice and struggle. The Zunyi 
Meeting was a great turning point in the history of our party. 
This meeting established Mao Zedong's leading position in the 
CPC Central Committee. Under the leadership of the central 
organ, with Mao Zedong at the core, on the basis of summing up 
the experiences of successes and setbacks in the past, our party 
gradually matured, making it possible for the revolutionary 
cause to move on relatively smoothly, deepened its understanding 
of the Chinese revolution progressively, and formed a set of 
relatively complete and correct theories, lines, principles, and 
policies. The success of the revolution and the maturing of the 
theory brought to the central leadership collective, with Mao 
Zedong at the core, a high prestige among the whole party and 
the people of the whole country. This generation of central 
leadership collective led our party for decades. The socialist 
New China emerging in the east was a great monument to the 
historic contributions made by this generation of the central 
leadership collective. 
  Considering the central leadership collective with Deng 
Xiaoping at the core as our party's "second-generation central 
leadership collective" was also in terms of maturity. This is 
because during the period from Mao Zedong's death in 1976 to the 
convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee in 1978, the chief leader of the party central 
committee was not mature. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee was another great turning point in the 
history of our party. This meeting established the leading 
position of the central leadership collective, with Deng 
Xiaoping at the core, in the whole party. The great practice in 
the past dozen years and the achievements of the reform, opening 
up, and modernization which have attracted worldwide attention, 
all testify to the maturity of the second-generation central 
leadership collective and the correctness of its theory and line. 
  [Gao] Could you please talk about the relationship between 
these two generations of central leadership collectives? 
  [Gong] From the perspective of theory and practice, I think 
one should mention three points, namely, correcting, inheriting, 
and developing, when discussing the relationship between the 
second- generation central leadership collective with Deng 
Xiaoping at the core and the first-generation central leadership 
collective with Mao Zedong at the core. One must mention all 
three points, not just one of them or two of them. 
  [Gao] One tends to be more used to the idea of inheriting 
and developing but, I am afraid, not everybody can accept that 
correcting is included and put in the first place! 
  [Gong] Inheriting and developing are very important. One 
can even say they are the fundamental aspects but, as far as the 
crux of the turn in history is concerned, correcting naturally 
has to come first. It means correcting the mistakes Mao Zedong 
made in theory and practice in his later years. There is a 
basic historical fact here. The civil turmoil of the "Great 
Cultural Revolution" inflicted very severe damage on the people 
of our country and cast the party and country into dire straits. 
Walking out of the shadow of the error of the "Cultural 
Revolution" was the premise of entering the new era. Smashing 
the "gang of four" marked the beginning of the historic turn 
but, in the first two years, the process of the historic turn 
met with difficulty. The problem was the lack of courage, 
resolution, and competence to face the mistakes made by Mao 
Zedong in his later years or to handle properly the matter of 
adhering to the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought and 
correcting Mao Zedong's mistakes in his later years. How did 
the two "whatevers" and the two years of "progress in the midst 
of marking time" come to be? An important reason is the absence 
of the political and theoretical courage in solving this problem 
and the resolution and competence to reverse and control the 
historical steering wheel. Under these circumstances, Comrade 
Xiaoping, as a proletarian revolutionary, showed his courage, 
insight, resolution, and competence. Comrade Xiaoping was brave 
enough to clearly point out and firmly correct Mao Zedong's 
mistakes in his later years and emphasized that only by 
correcting these mistakes is it possible to truly hold up the 
banner of the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. 
Naturally, however, the depth of discussion on mistakes depends 
on the time and place. At the beginning, he said Mao Zedong 
Thought is a scientific system and a phrase or two does not 
represent Mao Zedong Thought; later he said the theory and 
practice of the "Cultural Revolution" were fundamentally wrong. 
This was not just an issue of a phrase or two. This not only 
shows a progression of understanding but is also the art of 
guidance. The new era began with redressing the mistakes of the 
"Cultural Revolution" and "dispelling chaos." Comrade Xiaoping 
defined the term "dispelling chaos and restoring order" as 
follows: "Dispelling the chaos created by Lin Biao and the 
`gang of four,' criticizing Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes in his 
later years, and returning to the correct track of Mao Zedong 
Thought." 
  [Gao] Your analysis has given me a deeper understanding of 
the following remark made by Comrade Xiaoping: "In many senses, 
we should now start doing the things that Comrade Mao Zedong 
proposed, but did not do, rehabilitate the things that he was 
wrongly against, and make a good job of other things that he did 
not do well." 
  [Gong] The second-generation central leadership collective 
is to accomplish the causes unfulfilled by the first-generation 
leadership with Mao Zedong at the core. This includes 
correcting their mistakes. The second point is inheriting. 
"Restoring order" means inheriting. Dispelling chaos and 
correcting mistakes in no way means negating the past entirely. 
It is definitely wrong to negate what has been proved correct 
in practice. Soon after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping set out the four 
cardinal principles that our party must adhere to. The fourth 
principle is "adhering to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought." 
Today, we must inherit and adhere to Mao Zedong Thought that 
has been proved to be a scientific principle through China's 
revolutionary practice, including all the positive ideological 
fruit that Mao Zedong accumulated in the course of exploring 
China's own road of building socialism. Without this inheriting 
process, we would negate and disconnect history, lose our basic 
standpoint, and lose our bearings. 
  [Gao] Inheriting and developing are closely bound up with 
the "second revolution," "second leap," and the theoretical 
achievement of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Could you please first talk about the "two revolutions?" 
<H5>  Two Great Revolutions </H5>
  [Gong] The 14th National CPC Congress report pointed out: 
In the history of our party, the first-generation central 
leadership collective, with Comrade Mao Zedong at the core, led 
the whole party and the people of all nationalities in the 
country, through protracted struggle to win the success of the 
New Democratic Revolution and, following that, in establishing a 
basic system of socialism, emancipating and developing the 
productive forces, and turning the semicolonial and semifeudal 
old China, which had been subjected to endless bullying and 
humiliation by foreign aggressors over the past 100 years or so, 
into an independent socialist New China where the people are the 
masters. This revolution, the greatest of all times in Chinese 
history, constituted a new epoch in the history of this country. 
The fresh round of great revolution that the whole party and 
the people of all nationalities in the country have embarked on 
under the leadership of the second- generation central 
leadership collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core, 
through the reform and opening up is aimed at fundamentally 
changing the economic system which restricts the development of 
China's productive forces, establishing a vigorous and vibrant 
new economic system of socialism, and, in the meantime, 
reforming the political system and other systems accordingly, to 
emancipate and develop the productive forces even further. The 
objective is to turn China from an underdeveloped socialist 
country into a rich and powerful, democratic, civilized, and 
modernized socialist country, through protracted struggle, 
letting the superiorities of socialism be fully manifested in 
China. 
  The two generations of central leadership collectives have 
led two great revolutions. This is a new summary of the history 
of the party over more than 70 years made by the 14th CPC 
National Congress. 
  [Gao] The notion that "reform is China's second revolution" 
was put forward by Comrade Xiaoping as early as in the 
mid-1980's. When he first mentioned it, I came to you for an 
explanation. 
  [Gong] The concept leading to this statement can be traced 
to an even earlier date. The communique of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee clearly pointed out: 
"The realization of the four modernizations requires 
significant strengthening of the productive forces. This 
naturally entails changes to the production relations and 
superstructures which do not conform to the development of the 
productive forces in many ways and changes to all the modes of 
management, modes of action, and ways of thinking that are 
inappropriate. Therefore, it is an extensive and profound 
revolution." Comrade Xiaoping's speech "Emancipate the Mind, 
Seek Truth From Facts, and Look Ahead in Unity" was actually the 
keynote report of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee. This speech also said: "The process of 
realizing the four modernizations is a profound and great 
revolution." On the eve of that plenary session, when speaking 
at the Ninth Representative Conference of the Federation of 
Trade Unions, he also said: "This is a great revolution that 
will fundamentally change the backwardness of our country's 
economy and technology and further consolidate the proletarian 
dictatorship. Since it must drastically change the existing 
backward productive forces, this revolution will naturally, in 
many ways, change the relations of production, change the 
superstructures, change the mode of management of industrial and 
agricultural enterprises as well as the mode of management of 
the state over industrial and agricultural enterprises, so that 
they can meet the needs of a modernized large economy." Thus, 
it can be seen that beginning around the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping and the 
central committee of our party put forward the issue of China's 
second revolution from the perspective of the integration of 
modernization and reform. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee was the starting point of China's second 
revolution. 
  Though Comrade Deng Xiaoping mentioned this subject many 
times in the past, it did not attract enough attention. In the 
talks he made during his south China tour in 1992, he further 
expanded on this. He pointed out: "Revolution is to emancipate 
the productive forces and so is reform." "In the past, we only 
talked about developing the productive forces in the context of 
socialism. We did not discuss emancipating the productive 
forces through reform. That was incomplete." This is a 
profound explanation of the notion that reform is a revolution 
and China's second revolution. That is how this issue attracted 
more attention. Later, it was included in the documents from 
the 14th PC National Congress. 
  [Gao] Since this is a scientific summary of the history of 
our party over the past more than 70 years, should it become the 
basic approach in the study and research of our party's history 
and China's contemporary history? 
  [Gong] Today, textbooks still divide the party history and 
the history of revolution and construction by the Chinese people 
led by the party into two sections: One is the period of 
democratic revolution and the other the period of socialism. I 
think we can probably consider dividing the party history into 
three periods or three chapters in future: The first chapter is 
that of democratic revolution. It deals with the mighty 
revolutionary struggle conducted by the people under the 
leadership of the party. This period covered two major 
setbacks, witnessed relatively smooth development after the 
Zunyi Meeting, and ended with the great victory of founding the 
PRC. The second chapter is the early chapter of socialism 
dealing with how the party, after the founding of New China, led 
the people to the socialist road and to the great achievements 
in socialist construction. It also covered two major setbacks 
and ended with the victory of smashing the "gang of four" and 
putting an end to the "Great Cultural Revolution." The third 
chapter is the new chapter of socialism, beginning from the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. When 
the book "70 Years of the CPC" was being written, Comrade Hu 
Sheng [5170 4939] suggested highlighting the historical 
importance of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee in dividing the historical periods of the party. 
Though "70 Years of the CPC" was not written in three such 
chapters, it did mention this viewpoint in its epilogue. I also 
talked about this viewpoint at the seminar held by the Society 
of Chinese Contemporary History in Zunyi and on some other 
occasions. 
<H5>  Two Historic Leaps </H5>
  [Gao] The "two-revolution" theory gives us a big perspective 
for reviewing history and seems to have offered a logical 
premise to the formulation of "two great leaps." 
  [Gong] This way, we can sum up our party's history over the 
past 70 years or so from a higher perspective and over a larger 
span: The two mature generations of central leadership 
collectives with two great men, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, at 
the core, led two great revolutions and achieved two historic 
leaps in integrating Marxism with China's practice. The first 
mature generation of central leadership collective with Mao 
Zedong at the core led us in overthrowing the three big 
mountains, founding the PRC, and accomplishing China's first 
revolution. The first historic leap in integrating Marxism with 
Chinese practice was achieved during this process. The 
theoretical achievement of this leap was Mao Zedong Thought. 
The second mature generation of central leadership collective, 
with Deng Xiaoping at the core, led us to begin China's second 
revolution, i.e., the profound reform aimed at modernization. We 
achieved the second historic leap in integrating Marxism with 
China's practice in this process. The theoretical achievement 
of this leap is Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  The "two great revolutions" are in terms of practice, while 
the "two historic leaps" are in terms of the formation and 
development of theories. The two formulations are of the same 
inherent meaning. 
  [Gao] I remember the notion of "two historic leaps" was 
put forward by the 13th CPC National Congress. 
  [Gong] Yes. The report of the 13th CPC National Congress 
said: "The first leap took place in the period of the New 
Democratic Revolution. The Chinese Communists, after repeated 
explorations and on the basis of summing up experiences of 
success and failure, found the revolutionary road with Chinese 
characteristics and led the revolution to victory. The second 
leap took place after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee. The Chinese Communists, on the basis of 
summing up positive and negative experiences over the period of 
more than 30 years and studying international experiences and 
the world situation, began to find a road for building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and initiated a new phase of 
socialist construction." 
  [Gao] This statement only points out the times when the "two 
leaps" "took place." But there should also be an appraisal of 
the period between the nationwide victory of the New Democratic 
Revolution and the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, which is what you call the "first chapter of 
socialism!" 
  [Gong] In terms of the formation and development of theory, 
the exploration made by our party in practice and theory during 
this period was the extension of the first leap and the 
preparation for the second leap. In terms of practice, it was 
one stage in the first great revolution led by the 
first-generation central collective. The first revolution was 
in two stages, namely, the New-Democratic Revolution and the 
transition toward socialism. This great theoretical achievement 
of Mao Zedong Thought was born out of the first historic leap 
during the period of the New Democratic Revolution. During the 
socialist period after the founding of New China, it saw major 
development but, in the meantime, there was also deviation and 
distortion. For nearly 30 years after the founding of New 
China, our party's achievements in both practice and theory 
alternated with mistakes, which complicated the relationship 
between the two generations of central leadership collectives in 
practice and theory. It was by summing up the positive and 
negative experiences since the founding of New China that our 
party restudied the meaning of Mao Zedong Thought in a 
scientific way and achieved the second historic leap during the 
great new revolutionary practice, enabling Mao Zedong Thought to 
experience major development once again into Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
<H5>  Two Great Theoretical Achievements </H5>
  [Gao] The "two leaps" are reflected in the "two major 
theoretical achievements." There is the question of a 
scientific and accurate approach in interpreting these two 
theoretical achievements. First, the definition and 
interpretation of "Mao Zedong Thought" seems to have experienced 
a deepening process in history. 
  [Gong] In April 1945, the "Resolution on Certain Questions 
in History" passed by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth 
CPC Central Committee clearly defined Mao Zedong Thought as 
follows: Mao Zedong Thought is the thought which combines the 
universal principles of Marxism with the specific reality of the 
Chinese revolution. The resolution explained and enumerated the 
basic political, military, organizational, and ideological 
contents of Mao Zedong Thought by comparing it with the "left" 
and right opportunism in the history of the party, especially 
the erroneous "left" opportunist line during the period of the 
Agrarian Revolution. For the first time, it expounded on how 
Mao Zedong used Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods to work 
out a complete set of theories, lines, principles, and policies 
conforming to the reality of China's democratic revolution. On 
the basis of this, the report made by Liu Shaoqi at the Seventh 
CPC National Congress on amendments to the party constitution 
further explained the historical status of Mao Zedong Thought as 
the party's guiding ideology and its basic contents. For a long 
time, this remained the scientific basis for our party to 
understand, study, and carry out propaganda on Mao Zedong 
Thought. 
  Because Mao Zedong later made mistakes in his exploration, 
because Lin Biao and the "gang of four" distorted and falsified 
Mao Zedong and, in particular, advocated the mistakes made by 
Mao Zedong in his later years as an important development of Mao 
Zedong Thought, and because the ideological trend of "two 
whatevers," which was in reality sticking to Mao Zedong's 
mistakes in his later years, was still present after the "gang 
of four" was smashed, we were faced with the solemn tasks of 
dispelling chaos, restoring order, and reevaluating Mao Zedong 
Thought. The question of understanding Mao Zedong Thought 
included two aspects, namely, dispelling chaos and restoring 
order. Dispelling chaos meant dispelling the distortion and 
sabotage by Lin Biao and the "gang of four," dispelling the 
chaos caused by the wrong attitude of "two whatevers," and 
criticizing Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes in his later years." 
Restoring order meant "coming back to the correct track of Mao 
Zedong Thought" and "adhering to and developing Mao Zedong 
Thought." 
  As early as in 1975, when Deng Xiaoping was in charge of the 
CPC Central Committee's work and conducting rectification, he 
challenged the practice of Lin Biao and the "gang of four" and 
raised the issue of opposing "cutting apart Mao Zedong Thought." 
In 1977, he challenged the "two whatevers" and raised the issue 
of "understanding Mao Zedong Thought completely and accurately." 
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee 
held in 1978 genuinely started this process of dispelling chaos 
and restoring order. When giving guidance on the drafting of 
the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party 
Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," Comrade 
Xiaoping emphasized that the most central point in the overall 
guideline is to establish Mao Zedong's position in history and 
adhere to and develop Mao Zedong Thought. The "Resolution on 
Certain Questions in the History of Our Party" adopted in June 
1981 basically accomplished this task. The "Resolution" clearly 
and concretely pointed out the contents of the mistakes made by 
Mao Zedong in his later years, made a rigid distinction between 
them and the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought, redefined 
the meaning of Mao Zedong Thought, and emphasized that Mao 
Zedong Thought is the product of integration between the 
universal principles of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete 
practice of Chinese revolution, a scientific achievement proven 
correct by practice and a precious spiritual asset of our party. 
By this definition, with the abovementioned distinction 
included, only the correct ideas of Mao Zedong are called Mao 
Zedong Thought and the mistakes made by him in his later years 
are not part of Mao Zedong Thought; adhering to Mao Zedong 
Thought does not mean adhering to such mistakes in any sense but 
means we should correct these mistakes. 
  While affirming that Mao Zedong's scientific works are the 
concentrated summary of Mao Zedong Thought, the "Resolution" 
pointed, in the form of a party resolution for the first time: 
"Many outstanding leaders of our party made important 
contributions to its formation and development." The 
"Resolution" also expounded in great detail on how Mao Zedong 
Thought has enriched and developed "many aspects" of 
Marxism-Leninism with its original theories and the three key 
points of the living soul of Mao Zedong Thought. 
  This "Resolution" is a scientific basis on which our party 
reevaluated the scientific achievements of Mao Zedong Thought 
and on which we can understand, study, and carry out propaganda 
on Mao Zedong Thought today. 
  [Gao] In recent years, you have suggested and repeatedly 
emphasized that the "Resolution" should be regarded as a new 
starting point for the study on Mao Zedong Thought and its 
authoritativeness should be protected. It seems to me that this 
was directed to some specific ideas. 
  [Gong] There are two ideological tendencies: One is aimed 
at shaking the affirmation of Mao Zedong Thought by the 
"Resolution" and the other at shaking the negation of Mao 
Zedong's mistakes in his later years by the "Resolution." These 
two ideological tendencies are from different sources, yet they 
have one thing in common, that is, they both aim at shaking the 
"Resolution." 
  [Gao] Some theorists maintain that if an ideology is named 
after Mao Zedong, then all his ideas must be included. They 
think it does not make sense if only correct ideas are included 
and the incorrect ones are left out. They suggest that we stop 
using the formulation of "Mao Zedong Thought." What do you 
think? 
  [Gong] I do not agree with this opinion. I think our party 
has been using the concept of Mao Zedong Thought for so many 
years and, if we stop using it, it poses a disadvantage 
politically and also is not faithful to history. One cannot 
call it a scientific attitude if it is not faithful to history. 
The fact of the history is: The integration of Marxism with 
China's revolutionary practice bore scientific theoretical 
fruit. Can one deny this fact? It is of secondary importance 
as to what name this theoretical fruit should be called by. 
Since we have always used "Mao Zedong Thought" for this 
theoretical fruit and Mao Zedong did make the great 
contributions to its creation, there is no need or reason for us 
to cancel this name. What we should do is to assess many 
viewpoints we had in the past according to practice to find out 
which have been proven scientific by practice and which have 
been proven wrong by practice; name the scientific theoretical 
fruit created by the central leadership collective with Mao 
Zedong as the main representative as Mao Zedong Thought; and 
distinguish it from the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later 
years. 
  [Gao] You emphasize the authoritativeness of the 
"Resolution." How should one view the authoritativeness of a 
resolution? 
  [Gong] In my opinion, the "Resolution" is a product of 
partywide discussion on the basis of democratic centralism and a 
product of scientific study and testing through practice. 
Naturally, however, this does not mean it has reached the acme 
of perfection and that it is unnecessary or impossible to 
further our understanding of the history of our party since the 
founding of New China. Nevertheless, in my personal opinion, 
this "Resolution" did treat issues of history in light of facts 
and with as scientific an attitude as possible. It was sincere 
and was in no way a product of any simplistic, temporary needs 
or political compromise. Therefore, we should protect its 
authoritativeness. 
  [Gao] By "authoritativeness," do you mean that it was an 
organizational resolution made through statutory organizational 
procedures and confirmed by the party's supreme power organ? 
  [Gong] It is organizational authority I was talking about. 
In my opinion, the authoritativeness of the "Resolution" should 
contain two aspects: One is organizational authority, the other 
scientific authority. Only the combination of the two types of 
authority constitutes the greatest authority. It is not enough 
to talk about organizational authority alone because our party 
is one that pursues and obeys scientific truth. Each resolution 
of the party has organizational authority. If inappropriate 
points or points that do not conform to scientific truth are 
found in a resolution after it is adopted, it will be corrected 
eventually. Organizational authority cannot guarantee all party 
resolutions are certainly scientific and correct. But even if a 
viewpoint established in a party resolution is wrong, or is 
wrong in your opinion, it cannot be changed until the party 
organization has made a new resolution through a certain 
organizational procedure. Expressing opinions that go against 
the party resolution irresponsibly and without going through the 
organizational procedure means a violation of discipline and 
organizational authority. Naturally, however, organizational 
authority should, in the final analysis, be backed by scientific 
authority. If it is not supported by scientific authority and 
does not conform to scientific truth, organizational authority 
will lose its footing in the end and the organizational 
resolution will have to change. In my opinion, the "Resolution" 
is one that has been proven correct by practice; it is an 
organizational authority supported by scientific authority and a 
scientific authority supported by organizational authority. 
Shaking this resolution is a violation of both organizational 
discipline and scientific truth. 
  [Gao] The relationship between the "two major theoretical 
achievements," namely, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, is a 
theoretical issue of immediate significance. Could you please 
comment on this? 
  [Gong] The correcting discussed earlier means correcting the 
mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years. As far as the 
relationship between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is 
concerned, the key words are inheriting and developing. 
Correcting, inheriting, and developing are three components. 
The combination of the first two components means dispelling 
chaos and restoring order, whereas the combination of the second 
and third components means carrying forward the cause and 
forging ahead into the future. It means overall reform, forging 
ahead into the future, blazing new trails, making innovations, 
and developing. Dispelling chaos and restoring order alone 
means correcting erroneous things and inheriting correct things 
within the scope of Mao Zedong's theory and practice in 
accordance with practice as the touchstone. The new period 
requires innovations. There are many new problems emerging in 
the new period. Here, new problems means the many problems 
generated under the new circumstances which Mao Zedong did not 
face or that Mao Zedong came into contact with but failed to 
solve well. From internal affairs to diplomacy, the reform and 
opening up have run into many new problems which require us to 
solve them in a creative way. The issue of pioneering and 
innovating is far more complicated than distinguishing between 
right and wrong within the scope of Mao Zedong's theory and 
practice. To gain a correct understanding of and solve 
creatively the new problems under new circumstances requires new 
development of Mao Zedong Thought. 
  In May 1989, Comrade Xiaoping emphatically pointed out: "A 
true Marxist-Leninist must understand, inherit, and develop 
Marxism- Leninism in light of the current situation." "The 
world situation is fast changing and the modern science and 
technology, in particular, is developing at a high pace. One 
year today is equivalent to dozens of years, 100 years, or even 
longer in the ancient society. He who does not carry forward 
and develop Marxism with new ideas and viewpoints is not a true 
Marxist." He also said: "We must not demand that Marx offer 
ready answers to the questions appearing 100 years or hundreds 
of years after his death. Similarly, Lenin could not undertake 
the task of offering ready answers to the questions that emerged 
50 or 100 years after his death." "Mao Zedong, China's great 
Marxist-Leninist did not try to find the road to the victory of 
China's New Democratic Revolution in the books written by Marx 
and Lenin." By the same token, today, we should not rely on the 
books of our predecessors but, instead, use their scientific 
theories as the guide to make new creations in the face of new 
realities. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, our party has indeed made new progress in theory. 
Understanding and acknowledging this point is very important. 
It is not only a way to correct the mistakes made by Mao Zedong 
in his later years but also a continuation of the scientific 
system of Mao Zedong Thought. Meanwhile, there has been new 
progress in solving the new problems under the new circumstances 
in the new period. 
  [Gao] Can we say this new achievement in theory has 
developed into a theoretical framework and system? 
  [Gong] This process has started. This new theoretical 
achievement has been progressively expounded in depth and in 
width by the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of 
Our Party," the 12th CPC National Congress report, and the 14th 
CPC National Congress report, all in the dozen years' practice 
and development. The 13th CPC National COngress put forward 12 
scientific theoretical viewpoints and the 14th CPC National 
Congress summed up nine additional important aspects. Of 
course, there can be other ways to make conclusions and sum 
things up. There have indeed been many important developments 
in theory. 
  [Gao] After the 13th CPC National Congress, some people 
suggested calling these new developments in theory "Deng 
Xiaoping Thought [deng xiaoping sixiang 6772 1420 1627 1835 
1927]." Do you agree with this opinion? 
  [Gong] It is up to the central authorities to decide which 
formulation to sum them up. The formulation used by the 13th 
CPC National Congress was "the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics." After Comrade Xiaoping made those 
remarks during his tour of southern China, I found in the 
literature of the CPC Central Committee such formulations as 
"the theory and line of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping" and "Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's thinking on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics," which further highlighted Comrade Xiaoping's 
position in the founding of this theory. The formulation used 
by the 14th CPC National Congress was "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." In 
my opinion, this formulation is very good. The negative thing 
about it is that it is a bit too long as a term but its good 
point is that it highlights the theoretical theme of "building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics." Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the 
continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought in the new 
historical context. It is Marxism in today's China. Why do we 
use a separate concept to sum it up? Because it is not just the 
addition of some trivial points to the theoretical achievements 
of Comrade Mao Zedong but shows a considerably important step 
forward. It is a result of a series of new explorations, new 
innovations, and new creations. It has begun to form a new 
theory. Therefore, a new representation is necessary.

  [Text] Hefei, January 27 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province will select 50 major state enterprises to try out a 
modern enterprise system. 
  "These enterprises will become independent legal entities 
under the leadership of the boards of directors. They are 
required to be independent in economic operation, assume sole 
responsibility for their profits and losses and produce goods 
according to market demand goods," said Zhou Gulian, chairman of 
the provincial Commission for Economic Restructuring. 
  Other enterprises are being encouraged to follow suit, Zhou 
noted. 
  A survey showed that Anhui made some progress last year in 
reforming the enterprise system. 
  A number of state enterprises have already tried out the 
share-holding system by combining the change of the enterprise 
operational system with the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, thus enhancing their vitality and paving a way for the 
reform of this year. 
  According to Wang Xiuzhi, deputy governor of the province, 
Anhui will strive this year to expand to 100 the number of key 
enterprises trying out the share-holding system. That would 
cover 20 percent of the province's total. 
  It will encourage three to five key state enterprises to 
issue shares to the public and select one to compete for the 
national experiment in the modern enterprise system. 
  The province plans to lease or sell medium-sized and small 
state enterprises with poor economic results.

Secretary Xie Fei made an important speech. 
  Xie Fei stressed that united front work must be strengthened 
instead of being weakened. He referred to several problems 
which should be resolved in the current united front work. The 
first task is to expand the work field and to unite, educate, 
and guide individual, private, and nonstate-owned economic 
sectors; the second is to conduct meticulous and profound work 
in uniting nonparty intellectuals; the third is to scale a new 
height in overseas united front work; and the fourth is to 
uphold and improve the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and 
political consultative system. In his speech, Xie Fei also 
pointed out the need to do a good job in strengthening the 
united front work contingent.

  [Text] Yinchuan, January 26 (XINHUA) -- China has increased 
state investment in the five northwestern provinces and 
autonomous regions mainly inhabited by minority nationalities in 
order to step up development of rich local natural resources and 
promote economic prosperity. 
  Remarkable increases have been seen in both the amount and 
the number of projects involving state investment in the 
northwestern provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi and the 
Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions. 
  So far, half of the fund for economic development of these 
regions has come from state investment, which focuses on the 
exploration and exploitation of coal and oil resources, 
establishment of large state-owned enterprises and 
infrastructure construction. 
  The five interior provinces and autonomous regions in 
northwest China occupy one-third of the country's total 
landspace. Among the 160 kinds of minerals found in China, 120 
have been sited there. 
  Two out of the three newly-discovered large-scale natural 
gas 
fields are located in northwest China with the one in the basin 
on the borders of Gansu, Shaanxi and Ningxia the country's 
largest gas field ever found. 
  The plentiful natural gas of Shaanxi, the oil reserves of 
Xinjiang, coal resources in Ningxia and the rich water power 
resources of the Yellow River that winds through the region are 
all of vital significance to the country's economic development. 
  Despite the area's rich natural resources, northwest China's 
economic development has long lagged behind that of other parts 
of the country for geographical and historical reasons. 
  Promotion of the local economy and exploitation of natural 
resources has become an urgent need for the country. In China's 
eighth five-year-plan, priority has been given to the 
development of the transportation and electrical power 
industries and the tapping of resources in northwest China. 
  Increased state investment has been rewarded with extensive 
growth seen in electricity supplies, transporting capacity and 
output of petroleum in the northwest region, which is expected 
to become the country's number one energy supplier in the near 
future.

XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Great Hall of the 
People is decorated with lanterns and colored streamers today. 
Amid a jubilant atmosphere, the Central Military Commission 
[CMC] held a tea party for units stationed in Beijing and for 
veteran cadres in order to greet the Spring Festival. Jiang 
Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and other leading comrades 
happily gathered with veteran generals and comrades to greet the 
Spring Festival. 
  Jiang Zemin -- general secretary of the CPC Central 
Committee, president of the state, and chairman of the Central 
Military Commission -- delivered a warm and enthusiastic speech. 
On behalf of the party Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission, he extended cordial regards and expressed 
his high respects to veteran comrades, retired military cadres, 
commanders and fighters of the entire army, officers and 
soldiers of the armed police, and comrades of militia units and 
reserve forces! 
  Jiang Zemin said: Over the past year, while under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people 
of our country have grasped the opportune time to deepen reform 
and promote development, and have made new achievements. There 
has been political stability in our society, with rapid economic 
development, prosperity in the domestic market, thriving foreign 
trade, and continuous improvement of the people's standard of 
living. The publication of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping" is a great event in the political life of our 
party and state. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping -- which is linked with Volume 2 published 10 
years ago -- is a theoretical summation of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's abundant experience to guide us in carrying out 
reform, opening up to the outside world, and promoting socialist 
modernization; it is also scientific guidance to guide us in 
continuously making successful advancements. Since the party 
Central Committee decided to study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the entire country 
has begun studying the works. According to the guidelines of the 
14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure." This is our program of 
action in carrying out reform of the economic structure in the 
1990's, and will certainly have a profound influence on our 
country's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. We 
are firmly convinced that in the new year the entire party as 
well as people of the entire country will continue to advance 
successfully on the road of reform and development. 
  Jiang Zemin made a report to veteran comrades on the 
achievements of army building over the past year. He stated: 
During the past year, we have made new progress in army 
building. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee 
and the Central Military Commission, commanders and fighters of 
the entire army have united as one, worked in a solid manner, 
and successfully accomplished various tasks. The broad mass of 
officers and soldiers have taken on a good mental outlook, 
various units have maintained a high degree of stability and 
centralized unity [ji zhong tong yi 7162 0022 4827 0001], and 
there has been stable development in army building. 
  Jiang Zemin added: Members of the entire army have 
conscientiously studied the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and the thinking of army building 
in the new period; have conducted education on the party's basic 
line in a penetrating manner; have organized cadres at and above 
regimental level to study the theory and attend training on a 
rotation basis; and have enhanced the consciousness and 
determination of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in 
implementing the party's line, principles, and policies. We 
have strengthened strategic guidance for national defense and 
army building. Various units have strengthened military 
training and have extensively promoted the study of high 
technologies. The situation for military training for the 
entire army has been good and has rarely been seen in many 
years. Units at various levels have attached importance to the 
training of cadres and to the building of leading groups. We 
have stressed the need to carry forward the fine tradition of 
our army and maintain the true color of the Red Army. We have 
also achieved relatively great results in improving the party's 
workstyle and in advocating honesty in performing official 
duties in army units. We have made new progress in scientific 
research and in the improvement of arms for national defense. 
We have strived to improve the units' material and cultural 
lives and living condition, and have strengthened the 
attractiveness and rallying power [ning ju li 0413 5112 0500] of 
military units. 
  Jiang Zemin said emphatically: 1994 is a year of crucial 
importance to China's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. We should steadfastly follow Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, pool the strength of all nationalities, 
mobilize all positive factors, closely rally around the central 
work of economic construction, and make efforts to constantly 
push forward the cause of the socialist modernization drive. 
Under the new conditions, our army is shouldering heavy 
historical responsibility; it is necessary to further improve 
army building and reform, and enhance the fighting capacity of 
troops in an all-round manner to provide a firm and powerful 
security guarantee for the state's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. We should vigorously intensify ideological 
and political construction; earnestly study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; arm the broad masses 
of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the concept 
of army-building in the new period; uphold the absolute 
leadership of the party over the army; and adhere to the party's 
basic line and not waver in it for one hundred years. We should 
continue to comply with the demand of the Central Military 
Commission in further improving the quality of the army and in 
creating the best armed forces which our conditions permit. In 
accordance with the laws of developing a socialist market 
economy and army building, we should promote the reform of 
troops in an active and proper manner. As an important force 
for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our army 
should walk in the forefront of society in developing a 
spiritual civilization. We can have firm confidence that our 
great army will never fail to live up to the great trust of the 
party and the people, and will never let veteran comrades down. 
In this new year, they will make greater progress! 
  Jiang Zemin praised veteran comrades who, during decades of 
long revolutionary service, had gone through fire and water, 
fought bravely, and made great contributions to the cause of the 
Chinese people's liberation and the establishment of new China, 
as well as made indelible contributions to the growth and 
strengthening of the people's army -- this is the glory of our 
party and army. Veteran comrades have extraordinary fighting 
experience; they have shown concern over and support for army 
building, and have thrown a great deal of energy into such work. 
With respect to the achievements in army building, some credit 
should go to veteran comrades. Jiang Zemin expressed the hope 
that veteran comrades would continue to show their concern over 
the causes of the party and army, propose more ideas, and 
contribute more good policies. He asked commanders and fighters 
of the entire army -- particularly middle-aged and young leading 
cadres -- to emulate the veteran comrades' revolutionary spirit 
and sublime style, and carry forward and display the fine 
traditions of our party and army in order that the people's army 
will maintain the true qualities of Red Army veterans forever. 
Party committees and units at all levels should show their 
concern to veteran comrades from a political stand and take good 
care of them in their lives; they should further improve the 
leadership in the work for veteran cadres and do more actual and 
useful deeds for veteran comrades. 
  Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the CMC, 
presided over the tea party. 
  Attending the tea party were CMC members Chi Haotian, Zhang 
Wannian, Yu Yongbo, Fu Quanyou, Wang Ping, Li Desheng, Yang 
Dezhi, Xiao Ke, Chen Xilian, and Wang Enmao; Xue Ming, widow of 
Marshal He Long; Lin Yueqin, widow of Marshal Luo Ronghuan; and 
leading comrades of all general departments of the People's 
Liberation Army, various major units stationed in Beijing, and 
the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force. 
The troops' literary and art workers staged a brilliant 
theatrical performance at the party.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said today 
that the CAS will change its systems of operation, personnel and 
choice of subjects. 
  Speaking at the 1994 work conference of the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences, he called on Chinese scientists to "take hold of 
the opportunity to speed up development." 
  According to Zhou, the academy will not only develop into 
one 
of the most advanced research centers in China but also become 
an important base for China's high-tech industry and for 
training qualified scientists and technicians. 
  Zhou said the CAS will spare no efforts to promote the 
application of research achievements in industrial production 
this year. 
  In 1994, the CAS will focus its efforts on the research and 
development in such energy development as the burning, 
crystallization and conversion of coal and in the amelioration 
of red soil in hilly areas in southern China, comprehensive 
development and utilization of rare-earth resources and research 
and application of information technology. 
  The CAS will put into service its Shanghai Life Sciences 
Center and Beijing modern geoscience center this year and build 
some other science centres in the near future. 
  Without fixed staff, these science centers will operate 
under 
the guidance of the most prominent scientists with high 
attainments and with researchers, mostly with doctorate or 
post-doctorate degrees, to be appointed for a fixed period. 
  The CAS will train more post-graduates and post-doctorates, 
Zhou said. 
  It will also convert all its high-tech enterprises into 
joint 
stock companies. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a letter of 
congratulation 
to the work conference, urging the CAS to make breakthroughs in 
the frontier projects that will promote a new industrial 
revolution by making most of its advantages.

<F P=106> ["Random Notes on Hong Kong" by Zhong Yan (6988 1693): </F>
"Confession by the Last Governor of Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Recently, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten published 
an article entitled "Go Against the North Wind." The meaning is 
quite clear: To go against China through to the end on the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  Why has Chris Patten no scruples about declaring his stand 
of 
going against China through to the end? Just as he said in his 
article, the reason is that what he has done since he became 
governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only 
by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain. 
He said: "Some criticisms have appeared in both Britain and 
Hong Kong." But he also found excuses to console himself: "In 
an open and free society, such criticisms may appear." As a 
mater of fact, if there had only been "some" criticisms, there 
was no need for the governor to personally write such a long 
article to explain himself over such trifles. 
  The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten 
was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the 
interests of the Hong Kong people. He wrote: "Our 
responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put 
first." This British Hong Kong governor is really more 
concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people. For this 
reason, he feels it unfair that the Hong Kong people are 
criticizing and condemning him instead of saying thank you to 
him. But for the Hong Kong people, of course the Hong Kong 
Chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should 
be treated as real Chinese people of China rather than a 
conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of 
Britain is to ensure a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in 
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  In fact, responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong 
advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist 
interests of the British Empire. Some people criticized what he 
had done as "jeopardizing more extensive Sino-British 
relations." To refute this criticism he said: "Hong Kong is 
the biggest and most important component part of these 
relations." What is more, "judging from a long-term point of 
view, our position in China and Asia may, to a great extent, be 
decided by how we discharge our responsibility in Hong Kong in a 
dignified manner." 
  People cannot but ask: Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most 
important part of Sino-British relations? To the Chinese 
people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was 
plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by 
Britain against China. The Chinese people will never forget this 
national humiliation. If this humiliation is not wiped out, 
there can be no harmonious Sino- British relations. 
  However, this is obviously not what Chris Patten meant. Then 
what did he mean by saying Hong Kong is the "biggest and most 
important" part of Sino-British relations? Did he mean that the 
British Empire will not resign itself to the return of its 
richest colony to China, the rightful owner? 
  People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in 
China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its 
responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner? What 
position does Britain want to have in China and in Asia? What 
is the meaning of a "dignified manner"? If Britain ensures a 
smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, is it not a practice in a 
"dignified manner?" Can it not help improve the image of 
Britain and increase its position in China and Asia? Does 
Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name 
while preserving its position as the "governor" to show the 
power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the 
tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist? In this respect, 
what Chris Patten meant is quite clear. 
  In his article, Chris Patten brutally attacked China as a 
"villain." In fact, this is the right word for Mr. Patten 
himself. He threatened that if China did not obey the 
"governor's" arrangement, it should not expect Britain would 
agree to its return to GATT. 
  Although Chris Patten has taken great pains to protect the 
interests of the British Empire, he is not admired by some 
domestic opinion. Instead, he has been criticized and 
condemned. That is why he feels somewhat wronged. 
  Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, has been 
trying 
hard to preserve an actual colonial position in Hong Kong and 
revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old British 
Empire. Unfortunately, all this is but a day dream. 
  This article is actually a confession by Chris Patten, who 
has been driven to the wall, to prove his loyalty to British 
colonialism.

1627): "Central Authorities Propose 16-Character Principle, and 
This Year's General Economic Plan Has Been Formulated"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 January (WEN WEI PO) -- According to an 
authoritative source here, when discussing the general plan for 
economic work this year a few days ago, the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee put forth a 16-character principle of 
"grasping opportunity, deepening reform, promoting development, 
and ensuring stability [zhua zhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, cujin 
fazhan, baozheng wending 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 
7245, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 6086 4489 1353] and stressed 
that China was currently in the best period of its 150 years or 
so of modern history and that we should treasure this historic 
opportunity and concentrate our energies on developing economic 
work. 
  The economic development plan, which was submitted by the 
State Council to the Political Bureau of the party Central 
Committee for discussion on the basis of deliberations at the 
end of 1993, has the following main contents: The GNP growth 
rate will be set at about 9 percent, that of total industrial 
output value at about 15 percent, and that of total agricultural 
output value at about 3.5 percent. Investment in fixed assets 
throughout society is set to be 1,300 billion yuan. In import 
and export trade, goods worth $100 billion will be imported, 
while the same value of goods will be exported. Society's retail 
price index is set to be in the range of 10 percent. Moreover, 
arrangements on the quantity of currency issued and the loans 
scale for 1994 have been made. Growth rates in the economic 
plan for 1994 have been readjusted from 13 percent GNP growth 
and 22 percent growth in total industrial output value in 1993. 
  The top central leadership have deemed the above-mentioned 
readjustments necessary. This is the concrete embodiment of the 
idea of grasping opportunity, promoting development, keeping a 
sober mind, and squarely facing problems cropping up in the 
course of advancement, which the central authorities have 
repeatedly stressed. Only in this way can sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development be maintained. The top leadership 
maintain that in the second half of 1992, the central 
authorities urged guarding against overheated economic 
development, and, in July 1993, the central authorities again 
made a decision to strengthen macroregulation and control of the 
national economy. These policy decisions were made to counter 
difficulties in economic work. If they had not been promptly 
made, an economic situation such as that in the second half of 
1988 would have occurred or there would have been big ups and 
downs, as Deng Xiaoping stated, and tremendous losses would have 
been incurred. Thanks to several months of efforts, positive 
results have been achieved in macroregulation and control as one 
may well say and big fluctuations have been rigorously brought 
under control. As a result, the economy has maintained a 
relatively good momentum of development and the international 
community has given quite a favorable response to China's 
macroregulation and control efforts. The Chinese economy grew 
by 13 percent in 1992 and its GNP topped the 3,000 billion yuan 
mark in 1993, or another rise of 13 percent from 1992 in terms 
of constant prices. After the economy grew at a rate of 13 
percent for two consecutive years, the conditions for economic 
growth in some aspects have been strained and the restraining 
role of "bottlenecks" and inflationary pressures had begun to 
build up gradually. Moreover, we have to create conditions for 
maintaining rapid growth in the years to come. Compared with 
previous years, the greatest number of reform measures will be 
introduced in 1994, the tasks of reform will be the heaviest, 
and the widest range of interests of various sections will be 
affected. The top leadership holds that in making plans for 
economic work, we must give consideration to reform, 
development, and social stability. Plans should not be too 
rigid. We must create more favorable conditions for 
accelerating reform. Therefore, the central authorities set a 9 
percent growth rate, a rapid growth rate with an appropriate 
margin left for unforeseen circumstances, as General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin put it. 
  The authoritative source stressed that the central 
authorities set a 9 percent growth rate in terms of the national 
situation. When its comes to the economically developed eastern 
coastal regions where conditions are quite good, the central 
leadership urged them to make full use of their own favorable 
conditions and existing foundations for development and to 
develop a little faster if conditions permit so as to bring 
along and promote the development of less developed regions. If 
regions with relatively poor foundations for development cannot 
achieve such growth rates, they should not necessarily feel 
pressured. We must proceed in all cases from actual conditions 
and forge ahead steadily and surely.

"Stability, Legal System, Consensus Essential for Reforms, Says 
Official of State Commission for Restructuring the Economy"] 
  [Text] This year is being looked as one in which China 
will tackle "key problems" in its reform in the economic 
structure. A high-ranking official from the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economy pointed out that the difficulties 
China is facing in reforms are unprecedented and wide-ranging. 
In his view, the greatest pressure right now is inflation, 
which however was not caused by reforms, but by people's 
expectations. Reforms in China's macroeconomic system are 
themselves the greatest inflation-curbing factor. 
  Feng Bing, State Commission for Restructuring the Economy 
spokesman, pointed out a few days ago that reforms in 
macroeconomic systems such as taxation, financial, and 
investment systems and reforms in the microeconomy consisting of 
creating a modern corporate system are the two main programs for 
this year's economic reforms, both of which display the five 
characteristics of clearness, standardization, matching 
supports, increasing speed, and unexampled novelty. 
  How to handle the relationship between reforms and 
development? Vow to prevent as much as possible the unveiling of 
reformist measures from touching off relatively big social 
turmoil? Will inflation slow down the pace of reform? These 
have become the focus of attention from all circles. 
  Feng Bing pointed out that speeding up reforms is brought up 
under the historical demand of speeding up development, while 
speeding up development is achieved within the framework of 
speeding up reform. As the objective of creating a socialist 
market economic system becomes clear, there is now a more 
harmonious, mutually reinforcing and supporting relationship 
between reforms and development. Although new problems and 
contradictions appear, the focus now is on initiating parallel 
reforms in different subsystems within the reform system to 
solve new problems that appear in development, and not an 
all-inclusive and sweeping generalization on the kind of 
environment development will provide for reforms. This official 
believes that future fluctuation cycles produced by 
contradictions between reforms and development will shorten. On 
balance, reforms have been responsible for promoting sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development in a way that is much 
more powerful than the impact of the economic environment on 
reforms. 
  The beginning of new year saw the implementation of a new 
tax 
system and the smooth integration of renminbi rates, giving the 
"reform year" a good start, though there are still many points 
of difficulty. Mainly these are: One, will the pursuit of 
reforms in the financial system before the establishment of a 
new framework affect financing? Two, will reforms in the 
investment system that closely follow the financial reforms 
trigger another round of investment craze? Three, the 
promulgation of the "company law" signals the beginning of a 
modern corporate system. But many state- owned enterprises are 
heavily in debt, draining away huge state- owned assets, and 
there is not yet a social security system. Where to begin with 
all these problems? Four, how can rural reform be deepeneds? 
How can the problem of the slow growth of peasant income be 
solved? Five, how can speculative behavior be curbed and 
inflation pressure eased during the process creating a capital 
goods market? 
  Feng Bing believes that price rises might delay the 
promulgation of some specific reformist measures, but will not 
affect overall reform of the macro-system. At this stage, where 
the old overlaps with the new, essential administrative measures 
should be kept. The urgent thing right now is to start reforms 
in the financial system. 
  Feng Bing pointed out that now more than ever China needs 
stability and understanding of reforms. It must create an 
environment of "stability, legal system, and consensus" for 
reforms. 
  In specific operations, Feng Bing draw attention to the 
following points: One, the unveiling of reformist measures 
should be well timed, go through a certain procedure, and 
conducted scientifically to avoid "clashes between projects." 
Two, make the best use of circumstances and channel reform 
thought to popular actions. Three, increase the pace of 
legislation; 54 of this year's 152 legislative measures concern 
economic matters. Four, speed up progress toward "reentry into 
GATT," which will introduce external dynamics into domestic 
reforms. 
  This official of the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy stated that overall, he is optimistic about the reform 
situation in China this year.

  [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- As two great 
countries, the United States and China share common interests 
and goals in many important areas and their cooperation should 
be strengthened, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
here today. 
  The U.S. official made the statement while meeting with 
visiting Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu. 
  Progress has been made in U.S.-China relations since the 
Seattle meeting between the presidents of the two countries in 
November, 1993, Christopher said, adding that since then there 
have been other contacts and consultations at various levels. 
  This is good for enhancing mutual understanding, overcoming 
differences between the two sides, and further improving and 
developing relations between the two countries, he said. 
  The U.S. is committed to developing important ties with 
China, and is willing to join the Chinese side to enable 
relations to develop healthfully, Christopher said. 
  The U.S. official also expressed his admiration for the fact 
that the 1.2 billion Chinese people have benefited from rapid 
economic growth in recent years which have seen great changes 
taking place in China. 
  In reply, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu said that 
on the whole, the two countries' common interests and common 
ground outstrip their differences, and this is especially so if 
viewed in the long term. 
  He said China and the United States will eventually find 
more 
converging points of common interest and further relations 
between the two countries provided both sides show great 
foresight and look to the 21st century and the whole world, and 
strictly abide by principles set forth in the three joint 
communiques with a positive and serious attitude, respect 
reality and increase consultations. 
  Liu arrived here Tuesday [25 January] at the invitation of 
the State Department for political consultations at the 
vice-foreign-ministerial level, according to an agreement 
reached in Paris between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries. 
  Liu had three rounds of consultations with Deputy 
Secretaries 
of State Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis, respectively, on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
  The two sides had a wide-ranging exchange of views on 
bilateral relations, human rights, non-proliferation of weapons, 
trade, and regional and international issues. The two sides 
found they shared same or similar views on some of these issues, 
though differences remain on others. 
  Both sides agreed to continue consultations on an equal 
footing for appropriate, just and reasonable solutions to their 
differences with an attitude of mutual respect and looking to 
the future. 
  On Thursday, Liu also met with Deputy Defense Secretary 
William Perry at the Pentagon. He also met with former U.S. 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former U.S. 
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger. 
  Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Li Daoyu was also present at 
the meetings and consultations.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Bai Jingfu, deputy 
head and secretary general of the National Narcotics Control 
Commission of China, held talks here Tuesday [25 January] with 
visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard on 
anti-drug issue. 
  In a sincere and friendly atmosphere, Bai, also 
vice-minister 
of public security, and Gelbard exchanged views on cracking down 
on international drug-related crimes, especially on how to deal 
with the "golden triangle", place of origin for much of the 
world's illegal drug trade. 
  They agreed that it is necessary for China and the United 
States to strengthen cooperation in anti-narcotics efforts. 
  Bai said China hopes that the U.S. side would take positive 
steps to remove obstacles and promote a smoother and healthier 
development of Sino-U.S. anti-narcotics cooperation. 
  Gelbard pledged to work in this direction. 
  U.S. Ambassador to China Stapleton Roy was present at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Concerned with 
the personnel changes in the Russian and Belarusian Governments, 
the United States said it would link economic aid to the two 
countries' progress in reforms. 
  Washington has shown concern in recent weeks following the 
departure of two prominent officials from the Russian 
Government, and the removal of Stanislav Shushkevich as chairman 
of the Belarusian parliament. 
  State Department Spokesman Michael D. McCurry said 
Shushkevich's ouster "deprives Belarus of a leadership that has 
made a remarkable contribution to peace and stability in Europe 
and to the development of U.S.-Belarus relations." 
  The personnel changes in Russia and Belarus happened just 
weeks after President Bill Clinton's visit to the area. 
  "We continually reassess the policy in terms of changing 
events, but I think the overall policy, which has been to 
support the reformists, to support democraticization, is the 
right policy," said White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. 
  "We need to wait and see what their policies are before we 
make judgments about whether they've reversed course," Myers 
said. 
  While economic aid in other areas is tied to progress of the 
reforms, the fund promised for nuclear weapons removal in 
Belarus will go ahead, Myers said.

  [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate 
voted today to "expeditiously" lift the trade embargo against 
Vietnam. 
  The amendment, which was passed by a vote of 62-38 and will 
attach to the State Department authorization bill, is not 
legally-binding. 
  In response, White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said 
President Bill Clinton has not decided on the embargo but 
"welcome the Senate's sentiment on that." 
  "The President has made changing relations with Vietnam 
contingent on progress on MIA and POW (soldiers missing in 
action and prisoners of war) issues," she said. 
  Myers said the criteria for better ties with Hanoi include 
return of remains, resolution of discrepancy cases and 
cooperation with Laos on solving the MIA issue. 
  "Progress has been made but the overall issue is still under 
review," she said.

  [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
Administration has listed 10 countries as the major export 
markets of the United States, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said 
today. 
  "We have identified 10 countries categorized as big emerging 
markets, and we are going to come forward with a specific export 
strategy for all of those countries," Brown said. 
  Speaking at a press conference attended by foreign 
reporters, 
the secretary stressed that the country's specific strategies 
are "very focused" and "very targeted." 
  The secretary said that in doing so, the U.S. "doesn't mean 
the exclusion of any that aren't on that list of ten. It just 
means that we're going to be giving some special attention" to 
them. 
  He disclosed that his department has completed the work of 
planning export strategies to two of the 10 countries. India, 
Poland, Indonesia and Turkey are on the list, and Russia is not, 
he said, adding that there are no countries from the Middle East. 
  "I agree that too little attention has been given to India 
as 
a market. I intend to end that era of neglect and to give India 
significant attention in that regard," Brown said. 
  The secretary explained that the new list is an important 
part of the national export strategy put forward by the Clinton 
Administration late last year. 
  The criteria for emerging markets, Brown said, include 
economic strength, population size, opportunity for American 
exports, the market-drive nature of the economy, economic reform 
and privatization. 
  The government's policy towards investment and the 
protection 
of intellectual property rights are also important criteria, the 
secretary said.

  [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Gross 
domestic product will grow at an annual rate of 2.6 percent from 
1996 to 1999, the Congressional Budget Office said today. 
  In "the economic and budget outlook: Fiscal years 
1996-1999", 
the office projected the federal budget deficit to fall from 223 
billion U.S. dollars in the current year to below 170 billion 
dollars in fiscal 1996. 
  "The deficit picture is significantly brighter than it 
appeared one year ago," the report said. 
  "This distinctly rosier outlook is mostly a consequence of 
the substantial tax increases and spending cuts enacted last 
August," said the report. 
  However, the office added, "the deficit is not on a 
permanent 
downward path", and will climb up to around 200 billion dollars 
in fiscal 1999. 
  "Based on recent experience, some observers have doubted 
that 
deficits will actually decline as a result of the omnibus budget 
reconciliation act" which is president Clinton's budget 
reduction plan, the report said. 
  The office predicted that the real GDP of the country will 
grow at an annual rate of nearly three percent through 1995, 
while the unemployment rate will decline from 6.4 percent last 
December to 6.0 percent at the end of 1995. 
  The prediction by the bipartisan office for 1994 and 1995 is 
similar to the blue chip consensus of private forecasters, 
observers here said. 
  Today's report is one of a series of reports on the state of 
the economy and the budget that the congressional budget office 
issues each year. 
  In accordance with its mandate to provide "objective and 
impartial analysis", the 100-page report to the senate and house 
committees contains no recommendations.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "How the </F>
Sino-U.S. Textile Accord Was Reached"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Seventeen January was a 
day that drew people's attention. It was on this very day that 
the tense two days of textile negotiations between China and the 
United States were scheduled to end and when the drastic 
reduction of China's textile export quota, as announced by the 
U.S. Government at the beginning of the month, was to take 
effect. International public opinion has believed that the U.S. 
unilateral action of reducing China's textile export quota, if 
enforced, will trigger a trade war between the two countries 
which might result in tense Sino-U.S. relations. Thus, the 
success or failure of this round of Sino-U.S. textile trade 
talks carried major significance. 
  The text of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Sino-U.S. 
Textile Trade Agreement was subsequently signed by both sides at 
1740 [0940 GMT], less than half an hour before the U.S. 
negotiators' scheduled flight departure time. The concessions 
made by both sides on the premise of preserving their own 
interests have averted an outcome not beneficial to either side, 
and these have produced results satisfactory to both. 
<H5>  Focus and Divergence </H5>
  China has been the largest supplier of textiles and garments 
to the United States, with an annual export value amounting to 
several billion dollars and representing 13 percent of the 
textiles and garments sold in the United States. The quantity 
of Chinese textiles and garments to be exported to the United 
States are subject to the limits of U.S. import quotas to be 
negotiated and agreed upon before they are recorded in the 
textile agreement. 
  With the termination of the third Sino-U.S. bilateral 
textile 
trade agreement on 31 December 1993, China and the United 
States, from September through December 1993, held three rounds 
of unsuccessful talks in a bid to conclude a fourth agreement. 
The focus of disputes was the question of "illegal 
transshipments." 
  The so-called illegal transshipments refer to illegal trade 
carried out fraudulently to avoid quota procedures binding both 
exporting and importing countries. The United States has 
alleged the serious illegal transshipment of China's textile 
exports to the United States. For example, China-made garments 
bearing the labels of another country or basically China-made 
garments transported to a certain country for simple processing 
were sold to the United States as local products, thus avoiding 
the quota binding China and the United States. 
  It should be pointed out that such illegal acts were carried 
out by a handful of enterprises in China. In fact, concerning 
the question of illegal transshipments, the stand, interests, 
and regulatory objectives of both China and the United States 
coincide. Illegal transshipments have not only upset the United 
States' import quotas in terms of protecting its own textile 
industry but have also disrupted China's export order, lowered 
the prices of its exported textiles, disturbed its export 
channels, and resulted in it being unable to guarantee its 
product quality. 
  China and the United States diverged on the following three 
major points: First, the United States maintained that about $2 
billion worth of Chinese textiles have been illegally 
transshipped to the United States, while China held that, 
despite the existence of illegal transshipments, the actual 
amount was not that high. Second, the United States pressed for 
a mandatory reduction of quotas, based on "substantial 
information", as a punishment, while China insisted that a 
punitive reduction, if permitted, must be based on the facts and 
should be examined in consultations to avoid unilateral action. 
Third, the United States emphasized that cracking down on 
illegal transshipments is the sole responsibility of the Chinese 
side, while China pointed out that both sides must be 
responsible in a common crackdown because these illegal 
transshipments involved not only Chinese exporters but also U.S. 
importers and businessmen of a third country who engaged in 
illegal activities. 
  As both sides held fast to their views, no agreement was 
reached in the first three rounds of negotiations. On 6 January 
1994, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor hastily announced 
that if both sides were unable to reach an agreement in the 
fourth round of negotiations, the United States would, beginning 
17 January 1994, reduce Chinese textile import quotas in 1994 by 
25 to 35 percent. 
<H5>  Mutual Concession; Mutual Benefit; Mutual Satisfaction </H5>
  Representatives of the Chinese and the U.S. Governments 
began 
their fourth round of negotiations in Beijing on 15 January. 
Accompanying the U.S. negotiators to Beijing were 
representatives of U.S. textile manufacturers, importers, 
retailers, and consumers' associations. Jennifer Hillman, 
leader of the U.S. delegation and chief textile negotiator for 
the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, said that they were here 
to supervise her negotiations. 
  As both sides were well aware, both parties' interests would 
be seriously hurt if negotiations were to break down again. 
Hence, from the very beginning, both sides were hoping to reach 
an agreement and the atmosphere was frank and pragmatic. 
  The negotiations were tense and tough. On the first day, Shi 
Guangsheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, invited his American counterparts to dine 
and then turned the dining table into a negotiating table, 
enabling both sides to better understand the other's flexibility 
limit. Negotiations on 16 January, a Sunday, adjourned at 0100 
hour in the morning. With talks entering a crucial stage by 
noon on 17 January, neither side had the heart to eat a formal 
lunch and merely filled their stomachs with hamburgers. 
  Both China and the United States eventually made the 
necessary concessions: 
  China -- agreed to accept a textile quota reduction of up to 
three times the amount of textiles if conclusive evidence proves 
Chinese enterprises' involvement in illegal textile 
transshipments; accepted major adjustments to automatic 
increases of some categories of textile quotas as proposed by 
the U.S. side; agreed to factory visits by personnel from the 
U.S. Mission in China after obtaining the Chinese side's 
consent, permission from the enterprises to be visited, and on 
condition that they be accompanied by personnel from the Chinese 
side; and agreed to hold consultations over the imposition of a 
limit on silk products. 
  The United States -- renounced the reduction of Chinese 
textile import quota by 25 to 35 percent; withdrew the original 
discretionary clause in the handling of the illegal textile 
transshipment problem; agreed to a 1.63 percent increase margin 
for 1995/1996; and agreed to retain the flexible clause on 
interchangeability of quotas for different categories of 
textiles. 
  Mutual concessions lead to mutual benefits. The agreement, 
reached on the basis of mutual concessions, has helped both 
sides avoid major losses. China will not be forced to lower its 
annual textile exports worth more than U.S.$1 billion and the 
American importers, retailers, and consumers will avoid losses 
amounting to tens of billions of dollars as a result of drastic 
import reduction of Chinese textiles. Viewing the situation as 
a whole, if a fierce trade war were to erupt between the world's 
largest developed and developing nations, their economic losses 
would be unmeasurable. 
  This agreement also signifies that, as trading partners, a 
party should not ignore the views of another by indiscriminately 
and unilaterally handling contradictions and problems emerging 
from bilateral trade. As Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, told Chief U.S. negotiator 
Ambassador Hillman after the signing of the agreement: The best 
way to solve problems is through dialogue and consultations on 
an equal footing; any attempt to exert pressure will be in vain 
and will only lead to a trade war. 
  Ambassador Hillman also acknowledged that the adoption of a 
formula deemed fair to both sides has resolved differences and 
led to an agreement satisfactory to both. 

<H5>    The Chinese People Certainly Mean What They Said </H5>
  The Chinese Government has always attached great importance 
to the question of illegal transshipments, a focus of the 
Sino-U.S. textile trade talks. 
  As far as strengthening propaganda and education among 
enterprises engaged in export and production and perfecting 
legal systems are concerned, the relevant departments have 
successively handed down more than a dozen documents, explicitly 
banning illegal textile transshipments. Serious actions were 
also taken to crack down on such illegal activities. In 
particular, the "Provisions on Banning Illegal Textile 
Transshipments," jointly formulated and promulgated in March 
1993 by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
the General Administration of Customs, the State Administration 
for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, emphasized 
both prevention and crackdown. Three national conferences were 
convened in early 1991 and in early and late 1993 to 
specifically thrash out related matters. 
  On the organizational side, in July 1992, China set up a 
group to investigate illegal textile transshipment problems. 
With participation by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, the 
State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities, and with Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, as chairman, 
the group led a nationwide campaign against illegal textile 
transshipments. Nationwide on-the-spot investigations were 
conducted in September 1992 and May, July, and August 1993 to 
identify problems and plug loopholes. 
  In late June 1992, in a bid to strengthen cooperation with 
U.S. Customs for joint action, China submitted to the United 
States a proposed draft of "the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Joint Prevention of Illegal Textile 
Transshipment (Draft]." China also instituted investigations 
of enterprises suspected of involvement in illegal transshipment 
activities and, once confirmed with conclusive evidence, took 
stern measures against them, including punishing those who were 
responsible and exposing their activities. So far, China has 
punished 14 China-based enterprises dealing with export and 
production, terminated trade ties with three foreign 
enterprises, and closed down a foreign enterprise's office in 
China. 
  It should be pointed out that, after all, Chinese 
enterprises 
engaged in this sort of illegal activities are extremely few in 
number. Of the 69 illegal textile transshipment cases the 
United States handed over to China between April 1990 and 16 
January 1994 for full investigation, only five out of the 47 
investigated cases were confirmed, the rest lacked full or 
sufficient evidence. 
  Vice Minister Shi Guangsheng, leader of the Chinese 
negotiating team, emphatically pointed out: This handful of 
enterprises, which sought their own benefits at the expense of 
national interests, have upset the normal Sino-U.S. trade order; 
their illegal acts must be resolutely and sternly dealt with. 
From now on, enterprises involved in illegal transshipment will 
face quota reductions -- for serious cases -- withdrawal of 
operating rights, and -- for those held directly responsible -- 
legal consequences. 
  He further urged governments of various localities and 
departments in charge of foreign trade to attach greater 
importance to this issue and do their part in protecting 
national interests. He said that areas found to be involved in 
illegal transshipments will face punishment of more than three 
times the quota reductions. 
  The Chinese people certainly mean what they said; when a 
promise is made, it will be firmly honored.

  [Text] The relevant officials of the United States and the 
ROK said that Washington and Seoul are considering deployment of 
Scud [as heard] missiles in the South of the Korean peninsula to 
strengthen the ROK's defense capability and defend the ROK from 
the so-called attack from the North. 
  A vice foreign minister of the ROK, speaking to reporters 
yesterday, said that because the missile threat from the North 
is very real, the ROK hopes to strengthen the U.S.-ROK joint 
defense capability by the deployment of Scud [as heard] 
missiles. The foreign ministry official said that the missiles 
to be deployed in the ROK will not be purchased by Seoul but 
that they will only augment the arms equipment in the U.S. 
military base. 
  An ROK military figure said that the plan on the deployment 
of missiles was proposed by the U.S. side and that the ROK is 
worried that this step might provoke [chagugul chuge toelkkabwa] 
North Korea [choson]. 
  A U.S. official on 25 January had said that the demand for 
the deployment of the missiles in the ROK had been made by the 
commander of the U.S. Forces in the ROK. The U.S. official 
stressed that the United States does not intend to provoke North 
Korea by the deployment of the missiles in the ROK or to use the 
Scud [as heard] missiles as a leverage for the nuclear arms 
negotiation between the United States and Korea.

  [Text] A International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
spokesman said on 27 January that the U.S. plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the ROK will not be an obstacle to ongoing 
negotiations between the IAEA and Pyongyang on the nuclear 
inspection issue. 
  In a meeting with reporters in Vienna, David Kyd noted that 
since this plan clearly has a defensive nature, it will not 
represent a threat to anyone and that this plan is an issue 
between the United States and the ROK. 
  Patriot missiles, which were developed and manufactured in 
the United States, were used during the Gulf war for the first 
time. These missiles successively destroyed Scud missiles fired 
by Iraq at Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
  On 25 January, the U.S. Government said that the plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK was proposed by the commander 
of U.S. Forces in the ROK. This plan has not been approved by 
President Clinton nor has the date of deployment or the number 
of missiles been decided.

  [Text] Tokyo, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national Japan-China 
Friendship Association and the Tokyo Japan-China Friendship 
Association jointly held a new year reception at the Nyosui Hall 
in Tokyo this afternoon to express wishes for even greater 
progress in the friendly ties between Japan and China in the new 
year. 
  At the new year party, Ikuo Hirayama, president of the 
national Japan-China Friendship Association spoke first. He 
reviewed the healthy development of friendly ties between Japan 
and China amid drastic changes in the world situation. Hirayama 
said: Japanese-Chinese friendly ties have entered a new stage 
with the advent of the new year. He believed the development of 
friendly relations between Japan and China will contribute 
immensely to peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the world. 
  After that, invited guest Wang Yi, minister-counsellor at 
the 
Chinese embassy in Japan, delivered a speech. He said: The 
development of Sino-Japanese friendly ties is inseparable from 
the constant efforts over a long period made by the 
Sino-Japanese Friendship Association as well as by other 
friendly Japanese people's organizations. He hoped the 
Japan-China Friendship Association would make even greater 
contributions to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendly relations 
in the new year. 
  Japanese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also 
attended the new year reception and spoke at the gathering. He 
expressed satisfaction with the development of Japan-China 
relations. He talked about his recent official visit to China, 
saying: China's reform and opening to the outside world are 
progressing in a healthy direction. He expressed his heartfelt 
joy over China's ability to overcome difficulties that arose in 
the course of its development, and over China's rapid economic 
development. Hata said, to further enhance the development of 
Japan-China ties, he hoped the anticipated visit by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa to China would be realized soon. 
  About 500 invited guests including Yoshio Sakurauchi, former 
speaker of Japan's House of Representatives and chairman of the 
Japanese Association for the Promotion of International Trade, 
responsible officers of various Japanese people's organizations, 
and friendly people from various circles, as well as President 
Jiang Yanlong and Honorary President Chen Kunwang of the 
Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations in Tokyo, attended 
the new year reception.

Database] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec -- A senior PRC Foreign Ministry 
official on 25 December spoke about the Chinese Government's 
overall diplomatic policies centering around those concerning 
Asia. As for the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear issue, he gave an 
optimistic assessment, saying: "In part, there are encouraging 
signs. If all those concerned make efforts to continue 
dialogue, an appropriate solution will be found eventually." In 
explaining China's exports of oil to North Korea, he said, 
"China and North Korea will in the future continue to further 
normal economic trade relations, based on the principle of 
equality and reciprocity." He thus hinted that China's policy 
is to continue to export oil to North Korea in 1994 at least at 
the level of that of 1993. 
  As far as the matter of exporting oil to North Korea is 
concerned, a U.S. State Department spokesman recently talked 
about the possibility of imposing sanctions on North Korea if 
negotiations with that country fail. The PRC Foreign Ministry 
official's remarks can be said to have confirmed China's stand 
of not being willing to cooperate in an effort to ban oil 
exports to North Korea. The official indicated that China is 
urging North Korea to accept dialogue on the nuclear question, 
for he said, "We have always said to all the people concerned 
that what is needed is dialogue and not confrontation." 
  Asked about the economic situation of North Korea, the 
official insisted, "China does not interfere in or comment on 
the domestic affairs of any other nation," but he still assessed 
the policy recently announced by North Korean President Kim 
Il-song of "giving top priority to trade, agriculture, and light 
industry" as being an "important strategic policy in the 
economic sector." He welcomed the new policy, noting, "We hope 
that North Korea will be successful in improving the national 
economy and the living standards of the people by implementing 
the new policy." 
  It is unusual for an official of China's responsible bodies 
to comment specifically on North Korea's economic policy. The 
Chinese Government appears to be positively accepting North 
Korea's new policy of placing emphasis on opening up the country 
and improving the people's living conditions. 
  When asked whether there was no possibility of resuming 
negotiations with the United Kingdom over the Hong Kong 
question, the official only criticized the United Kingdom and 
noted that China will hasten with preparations for the return of 
Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec -- Commenting on the issue of 
North Korea's refusal to permit international inspections of its 
nuclear sites, a high-ranking Chinese Foreign Ministry official 
said on 25 December, "desirable signs have already appeared." 
  The Chinese official's remarks strongly hinted that North 
Korea may be ready to accept international inspections. The 
official also disclosed that China is poised to cooperate with 
the new economic policy that North Korea has adopted. 
  China has publicly taken a neutral position on the North 
Korean nuclear issue. In fact, however, China is said to have 
urged North Korea to accept international inspections. The 
Chinese official was confident of progress in U.S.-North Korea 
dialogue, saying, "Compared with the situation six months ago, 
(U.S.-North Korea) dialogue is making steady headway." 
  He also said: "The Workers' Party of Korea recently held a 
plenary session of its Central Committee to adopt a very 
important policy of rebuilding North Korea and its economy. 
This policy is noteworthy." The official spoke highly of the 
"three-first policy North Korea has adopted to develop trade, 
agriculture and light industry." 
  The high-ranking Chinese official said: "I believe that 
China will continue to develop its normal, cooperative relations 
with North Korea based on the principle of equality and 
reciprocity." 
  His comments made it clear for the first time that China 
will 
cooperate with North Korea in rebuilding Pyongyang's economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec -- On 25 December, a high-ranking 
official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed the hope that 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would visit China at 
an early date. Speaking about how the Sino-Japanese 
relationship would develop in 1994, the official said: "We hope 
Prime Minister Hosokawa can visit China as early as possible 
next year." 
  He described a visit by Hosokawa to the PRC as "important 
for 
China." However, considering the current fluid political 
situation in Japan, he added that the prime minister could visit 
here "at any time that is convenience to him." 
  His remarks expressed the hope that Hosokawa would make a 
visit, even if only short, whenever he found time during the 
Diet session. 
  Touching on the subject of Japan's bid for a permanent seat 
on the United Nations Security Council [UNSC], he said: "In 
principle, China also supports the idea of expanding and 
reforming the structure of the UNSC when time is ripe." 
However, he reiterated China's cautious stance, saying: "It is 
necessary to listen to the opinions of member nations to form a 
consensus." 
  The official expressed opposition to a view supported by 
some 
members of the Japanese ruling coalition that Japan should start 
government-level exchanges with Taiwan. 
  He said: "Naturally, China is interested in moves in Japan 
to send its ministers to Taiwan." He called on Tokyo to stick 
to its policy of normalizing relations with China while limiting 
exchanges with Taiwan to those at the private level. 
  The official also commented on the proposal to establish a 
council of representatives from the Chinese National Defense 
Ministry and the Japanese Defense Ministry which would be a 
separate body from the security council formed by the foreign 
ministries of each country. 
  He said: "I agree to promote dialogue between the defense 
authorities." 
  He also made a point about the Sino-Japanese security 
council. 
  "Although Japan calls it the security council, China refers 
to the dialogue on regional security between the foreign 
ministries, so other countries will not mistake for a forum 
similar to the Japanese-U.S. security committee." 
  His remark indicated there is a slight difference between 
Tokyo and Beijing in their views on the nature of the council.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan -- Recently, Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen 
separately visited King Norodom Sihanouk at a hospital in 
Beijing. Diplomatic sources here think that King Sihanouk, who 
underwent an operation for cancer at the hospital, is now in 
serious condition. 
  Immediately after his rectum was operated on in October last 
year, King Sihanouk announced: "I have contracted cancer." He 
is currently being hospitalized at an army hospital in Beijing. 
Prime Minister Ranariddh reportedly visited the king at the 
hospital on the evening of 17 January, upon the delegation's 
arrival in Beijing. Prime Minister Hun Sen visited the king on 
18 January. The Sihanouk Office [name as published] and the 
Cambodian Embassy in Beijing have not given answers to why the 
two did not visit the king together. 
  Claiming that he is ill, King Sihanouk has been controlling 
Cambodian politics from Beijing. A diplomatic source said: 
"His health condition does not seem to be the same as it was 
when he initially chose to `pursue politics' from here. Despite 
the visits by the two prime ministers, no message has been 
delivered from the king. This indicates that his health 
condition is worsening."

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan -- King Sihanouk, who is currently 
undergoing cancer treatment in Beijing, will probably be able to 
return to Cambodia in early April because of smooth progress in 
chemotherapy. This was disclosed on 20 January by the Sihanouk 
Office in Beijing. Since negotiations between the government 
and the Pol Pot faction have been deadlocked, expectations for 
the King's return to break the deadlock have been growing in 
Cambodia.

  [Text] Shanghai, 15 Jan -- According to a Chinese source, 
China's supreme leader Deng Xiaoping, who is staying in 
Shanghai, will visit Guangzhou and Zhuhai in Guangdong Province 
between late January and Chinese New Year's day (10 February). 
Moreover, the possibility of a visit to Hainan Province is also 
being studied. In recent years, Mr. Deng has spent New Year's 
days in Shanghai. However, he will leave Shanghai this year. 
  The inspection tour to the southern region is aimed at 
showing Mr. Deng's strong will regarding the complicated Hong 
Kong issue by visiting Guangdong Province, which has close 
economic ties with Hong Kong. At the same time, it seems the 
visit is also aimed at seeking continuation of high level 
economic growth in southern China.

<F P=106> [By Moritaka Okazaki in Beijing; received via Nikkei Telecom </F>
database] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec -- Chinese Primer Li Peng, who 
lacked vitality because of prolonged medical treatment, is 
making a remarkable comeback. He only met with foreign VIP's 
who visited China. However, he has now expanded his activities. 
He has hosted important domestic meetings and has even 
energetically made a keynote speech. Owing to this, some 
leaders, who were calling for Li's resignation at the National 
People's Congress [NPC] slated for next March, were placed in 
suspended animation. It has become certain that the Jiang 
Zemin-Li Peng structure, which was formed with an eye toward the 
post-Deng Xiaoping era, will continue to remain in power. 
  Premier Li took a low profile because of heart trouble in 
late April. He did not appear at official events until 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir visited China in mid-June. 
After that, he started to attend meetings with foreign VIPs 
visiting China. Nevertheless, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, "acting 
on behalf of Premier Li Peng," hosted important meetings of the 
State Council (government). During this time, many things 
happened; Li Guixian, president of the People's Bank of China 
who was close to Premier Li, was forced to step down form his 
post. This was in contrast to Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji's rise. 
Premier Li Peng's retreat seemed apparent. 
  However, Premier Li Peng started to recover lost ground as 
he 
regained his health around October. In particular, he made a 
long speech on "next year's main tasks" at a national economic 
policy meeting, which was held in early December following the 
Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee. He 
impressed local representatives at the meeting that he was a top 
government leader by presiding over the most important final day 
of the meeting. 
  Premier Li Peng, who was reelected at the NPC in March this 
year, will remain in his post another five years. Some people 
thought, when Premier Li Peng was not attending official events 
this summer, that he would step down form his post and be 
replaced by Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji during the next NPC 
scheduled for March next year. Lately, however, people no 
longer have such a view and members of the leadership have 
agreed that replacing the premier will not be on the agenda of 
the next NPC. 
  Although it is certain the premier's powers will be 
restored, 
there is no doubt that Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji will continue 
to have overall control of economic policy matters. It seems 
that relations with the United States, which is the pillar of 
Chinese diplomacy, are under the control of President Jiang 
Zemin. Therefore, there is no prospect of Premier Li Peng 
displaying his leadership authority.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan -- Chinese judicial authorities 
plan to release on parole Wang Juntao (aged 36), a Chinese 
democratic activist who is currently serving a prison term for 
involvement in the 1989 Tiananmen incident, as early as before 
the Spring Festival (10 February, or Chinese New Year), 
according to a well-informed local source. Wang, who has 
formerly served as deputy director of the Beijing Institute of 
Social and Economic Sciences, is to be released so he can 
receive medical treatment, the source said. During the U.S.-PRC 
summit meeting in Seattle last November, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton expressly cited Wang's name and asked Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin to have Wang released. In view of the approaching 
expiration of the most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China 
next June, it is believed China plans to release Wang as a 
gesture toward the United States for requesting renewal of the 
status. 
  On renewal of the status, the Clinton administration has 
maintained it an imperative condition that improvements be made 
in China's human rights issue. U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd 
Bentsen plans to address Chinese leaders to reiterate U.S. 
position on this issue during his planned visit to Beijing on 19 
January. Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
plans to ask Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during a 
foreign ministerial meeting in Paris on 24 January that 
improvements be made on the human rights issue. 
  China has already expressed its willingness to accept 
inspections of its prisons by the International Committee of the 
Red Cross. Recently, it also dropped charges against two Tibetan 
political prisoners and released them. The United States, 
however, has asserted these actions are insufficient.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Wei Jingsheng by Miwa Shimizu </F>
on 4 January; place not given] 
  [Text] [Shimizu] What have you discovered since you were 
released? 
  [Wei] Two unexpected trends have developed. Many people 
were afraid of making contacts with us [not further specified] 
15 years ago. Now, however, many people, from members of the 
communist party to ordinary old peasants (the general public), 
are giving us words of encouragement. Another thing is the fact 
that corruption, including bribery and embezzlement of state 
assets, is spreading among senior communist party officials at a 
faster rate than I expected. 
  [Shimizu] Can you tell us about life in prison? 
  [Wei] I was put in a punishment cell when I was in prison in 
Beijing. I was given only wotou (steamed bread made of 
cornmeal) to eat. Nobody, including the prison guards, was 
allowed to speak to me for five years. I became unable to talk. 
  [Shimizu] What about your health? 
  [Wei] I was not allowed to sunbathe one year during the five 
I spent in the Beijing prison. I was not given vitamin pills 
either. My teeth became weak, but I was not allowed to have 
dental treatment. Now I wear false teeth. At first, they did 
not even take me to a doctor when I had pain in my heart. I was 
allowed to see a doctor at long last and found out that I had 
heart trouble. Immediately after that, they transferred me to a 
prison in the highland of Qinghai Province. I think they wanted 
see me die in the prison. They began to treat me a little 
better about 1985, when Hu Yaobang (former CPC general 
secretary) improved treatment of political prisoners. 
Fortunately, my body was able to adjust the life in the 
highland. Otherwise, I would not have come back alive. Not many 
people come back alive from the highland prison. There is a 
saying in China: criminals may not be afraid of the death 
sentence, but they are afraid of a 15-year imprisonment. 
  [Shimizu] Were you able to find out information on the 
Tianammen Square incident of 4 June 1989? 
  [Wei] I partially knew about it because RENMIN RIBAO was 
reporting the truth for a while (before the incident). It was a 
big chance for China. But, since the government and the 
students handled the incident badly, only the most reactionary 
forces benefited from it. Because of this, freedom of the press 
and much of the political reform movement receded to the level 
of the time of the Great Cultural Revolution. 
  [Shimizu] Do the security police still interfere with your 
activities? 
  [Wei] The security police gave me warnings for several 
reasons, one of which was that I contacted foreign 
correspondents within three months of my release. I received an 
official warning for the article I wrote for THE NEW YORK TIMES 
last November. 
  [Shimizu] The United States is changing its attitude toward 
the human rights issue. 
  [Wei] It is not wise to do that. I understand the need to 
do business. However, I hope the United States will continue to 
maintain its responsible attitude toward the democratic movement 
and human rights conditions in China. 
  [Shimizu] What do you expect of the Japanese Government? 
  [Wei] Lately, the Chinese people think that the Japanese 
Government supported the most reactionary government of China. 
Japan supported China because of the traditional strategy that 
the more China lags behind Japan in the economic field, the 
safer Japan would become. However, China is lagging behind 
Japan so much in the economic field that major disorder in China 
will not benefit Japan. I hope Japan will support the 
progressive forces in China while giving consideration to 
historical perspectives as well. 
  [Shimizu] But China is maintaining high economic growth. 
  [Wei] We must not forget the fact that the statistics given, 
which are affected by China's social system, are not accurate. 
Virtually all conceivable products are sold in countries which 
have normal market economies. But many products are still not 
sold in China. Nevertheless, the statistics show that China's 
production is growing. Basically, China's wealth has not grown 
since 1989. Prices of goods go up rapidly and most of people's 
incomes cannot keep pace with inflation. In inland provinces, 
in particular, farmers, who are unable to make a living, are 
waiting for leaders who can help them start a riot. A serious 
riot will break out sometime in the future, when the Communist 
Party, which continues to oppress the people, is no longer able 
to keep them under control. 
  [Shimizu] Deng Xiaoping says that liberalization will invite 
rioting. 
  [Wei] Knowing that one form of party dictatorship does not 
work, the Communist Party is suppressing people who talk about 
new theories and new regimes. The history of overthrowing 
imperial regimes and the tradition of violent revolution still 
exists in China. Oppression of the people will invite rioting. 
Our task for the time being is to nurture a new, wise, and 
moderate political force which will challenge the Communist 
Party's absolute grip on power. 
  [Shimizu] Is the process of forming a new political force 
making headway? 
  [Wei] I have to get in touch with people who are willing to 
take part in the democratic movement, and many other people, 
including members of the Communist Party. There is no precedent 
for a violent revolution producing good results. Therefore, we 
are not hoping that the communist administration will be 
overthrown in a day. However, we have to change this system.

<F P=106> [By reporter Masaru Soma] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 30 Dec -- On 30 December it was learned 
that the CPC Central Military Commission [CMC] recently met in 
Beijing and decided to remove a top military officer who had 
previously been promoted in recognition of his contribution in 
the June 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen uprising. A Chinese 
source in Hong Kong revealed this. 
  During the meeting, the CMC also revised the "Military 
Guideline," the rules setting forth the role of the military in 
pursuing reform and open-door policy. This is the first time in 
five years that the guideline has been revised. It may be said 
that all this shows that Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and 
concurrent CMC chairman, is trying to solidify his position 
within the military. 
  According to reports by China's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, the 
Chinese Air Force's eighth meeting of party delegates was held 
in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 24 December. That 
meeting was attended by Jiang Zemin; Liu Huaqing, CMC vice 
chairman and member of the party Political Bureau Standing 
Committee; Zhang Zhen, CMC vice chairman; Defense Minister Chi 
Haotian; Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of the 
People's Liberation Army [PLA]; Yu Yongbo, PLA General Political 
Department director; Fu Quanyou, Political Department director 
of the PLA General Logistic Department; and many other top 
military officials. It appears that the CMC meeting was held 
around that time. 
  According to the Chinese source, the man removed during the 
CMC meeting was Zhang Gong, a political commissar in the Chengdu 
Military Region, who had served as the spokesman for the martial 
law force at the time of the Tiananmen incident. 
  In May of 1990, following the Tiananmen incident, Zhang's 
contribution was recognized and he was promoted, in one big 
sweep, from the position of director of the Beijing Military 
Region's Political Department to the political commissar of the 
Beijing Military Region. But in December 1992, he was 
transferred, in a de- facto demotion, to the position of 
political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region, and as a 
result of the recent CMC action, he was even removed from that 
position. The Chinese source insisted: "The personnel action 
strongly smacks of purging targeted at Zhang who, as the 
spokesman of the martial law troops, was a symbolic figure at 
the time of the Tiananmen incident." 
  The source said that the latest CMC meeting also demoted or 
removed the people belonging to the group linked to party 
Political Bureau member Yang Baibing who was dismissed as 
chairman of the CMC following the CPC 14th Congress in the fall 
of 1992. The source did not give details on it, however. 
  During the meeting, the CMC also approved the "Guideline for 
Building Army Grassroots Units" presented by General Secretary 
Jiang. Its purpose is to make the roles of the military forces 
comform to the government's position of pursuing the policy of 
reform and opening up. A draft for it was first presented to 
the commission five years ago. The passing of it by the CMC 
means that five years have been given to the work of 
transforming it into a formal "guideline." 
  The "guideline" can be said to be the basic action guideline 
for the military forces in the future, and asks the military to 
be "politically qualified, militarily strong, exemplary in 
attitude, strict in discipline, and logistically well prepared." 
The reason General Secretary Jiang wanted this completed is 
thought to lie in his desire to solidify his base within the 
military. 
  Meanwhile, in a ceremony in Beijing on 23 December, 12 
senior 
officials from the Chinese People's Armed Police Force 
Headquarters were promoted to the rank of major general. 
Concerning this, a Western diplomatic source in Hong Kong said: 
"The Armed Police Force is the organization in which Jiang is 
trying to gain influence over. There is no doubt that Jiang's 
political intention regarding the military forces was evident at 
that promotion ceremony."

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec -- As of 25 December, the Chinese 
Government has made firm its plan to reduce the official 
exchange rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar by about 50 
percent in the first quarter (January-March) of fiscal year 
1994, according to a financial source in Beijing. After the 
devaluation, the official exchange rate would drop to the same 
level as the market rate used in commercial transactions. Thus, 
a single exchange rate would be established. This would also 
help promote Chinese participation in free trade, as well as 
considerably pave the way toward its membership in GATT next 
year. 
  Currently, there are three different exchange rates being 
used in China. The first is the official exchange rate ($1 = 
about 5.8 yuan); the second is the exchange rate used in 
commercial transactions that is determined by the Foreign 
Currency Exchange Center ($1 = about 8.7 yuan); and the third is 
the exchange rate used in the black market ($1 = about 8.9 
yuan). According to the same financial source, the Chinese 
Government predicts that the market rate would be about $1 = 
8.8-8.9 yuan next year. By reducing the official exchange rate 
by about 3 yuan (51 percent), the government intends to 
establish a single exchange rate. 
  Originally, the government had tentatively decided to put 
the 
plan into effect on 1 January 1994, but the plan was postponed 
since financial institutions would require more time for 
preparations. However, the government reportedly plans to put 
the plan into effect by late March. 
  The yuan devaluation is expected to cause a rise in prices 
of 
imported and other items, with merchants taking advantage of 
the situation. However, the government plans to keep confusion 
in the market to a minimum by reinforcing price-monitoring 
operations. 
  So far, the PRC has issued two types of currency: the 
foreign 
exchange certificate (FEC), which can be exchanged for foreign 
currency at the official exchange rate; and the renminbi (RMB), 
which cannot be exchanged for foreign currency. With the 
establishment of a single foreign exchange rate, however, it has 
become meaningless to issue FEC's. Thus, FEC's, which account 
for about 20 percent of the total currency in circulation, will 
eventually be abolished. On the other hand, it will become 
possible to exchange RMB's for foreign currency.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with PRC Vice President Rong Yiren by </F>
Takeshi Takano, chief editor of INSIDER magazine, at the Great 
Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November 1993] 
  [Text] I Live in My Motherland as an Indigenous 
Capitalist 
  [Takano] I understand you are regarded as a symbol of the 
policy of China's reform and opening up. First, I would 
appreciate it if you would briefly tell me about the your 
personal history. 
  [Rong] I graduated from St. Johns University in Shanghai in 
1937. Immediately after graduation, I got a job at a factory my 
father operated. My father and my grandfather had been engaged 
in business since 1901. They operated factories. They mainly 
ran a flour mill and a spinning mill, which were regarded as 
important national industries in China. 
  If we briefly follow China's modern history, we realize that 
China has experienced the history of imperialism, feudalism, and 
bureaucratic capitalism. I was born in 1916, and, since my 
childhood, I have witnessed the confused days under the northern 
warlords and the Kuomintang [KMT]. Particularly when the KMT 
was in power, I witnessed how miserable and how confused the 
Chinese people were. 
  Honestly speaking, for some time before the birth of New 
China, I used to have strong expectations for the KMT 
government. However, immediately before the birth of New China, 
my expectations turned to disappointment. Also, as my parents 
inspired me with the patriotic spirit, and as my father had 
remained in China at that time, I was also determined to stay. 
After China's liberation, my contact with the Communist Party 
increased gradually and, by and by, I came to be very impressed 
and attracted by the pragmatic attitude of the Communist Party's 
leaders and the staff members in dealing with the problems and 
in carrying out their duties. While observing their way of 
doing things, which was totally different from the KMT's, my 
opinion about the Communist Party changed gradually. Thus, I 
have come to realize that socialism is the very structure that 
can save New China. 
  Of course, I had to come through very hard experiences 
during 
the process. In China, we experienced the unique incident 
called the Cultural Revolution -- I am sure you are very 
familiar with its history. Yet, I have never lost my confidence 
in the Communist Party because I firmly believe that the 
Communist Party has been working for the people and for the 
public. Such a belief has been supporting me when I was 
personally in hardship. In 1978, after the Cultural Revolution, 
the CPC held the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee and announced that it would change its policy and 
emphasize construction of the economy. The Chinese people were 
very glad to accept the proposal that all people should exert 
themselves in carrying out economic construction. I was very 
glad to hear the resolution as I had been interested in industry 
and business since my younger days. I felt it was my duty to 
contribute to the benefit of the people. 
  [Takano] It was your sense of duty that made you establish 
CITIC [China International Trust and Investment Corporation], 
was it not? 
  [Rong] In April 1979, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was vice 
premier at that time, called me and several other All-China 
Federation of Industry and Commerce [FIC] members and, on the 
premise that China was going to carry out a policy of opening up 
aimed at economic construction, we were asked to discuss the 
meaning of the opening up policy, that is, to discuss how 
important it was for China to carry out such a policy. At that 
time, Mr. Deng Xiaoping requested that since we were well-known 
members of the FIC, we should make the most of our experience 
and cooperate with China in carrying out its opening up policy. 
Particularly, he asked me to exert myself in introducing 
foreign investment into China in the future. 
  Coming back from the meeting, I considered the theme over 
and 
over again, and my conclusion was that there might be two ways 
we could take for the purpose of introducing foreign investment. 
One was to establish an organization similar to the existing 
governmental organization through which foreign investment was 
to be introduced. The other was to establish an enterprise -- a 
public corporation in Chinese words -- and to introduce foreign 
investment in the form of issuing bonds in the enterprise's 
name. I thought that, by all means, the better way was to 
establish a company which will be able to procure funds through 
broad contact with foreign enterprises, and I proposed my idea. 
I organized CITIC upon obtaining the consent of Mr. Deng 
Xiaoping and the State Council, who agreed that my idea was in 
line with their's. 
  [Takano] Please let me ask a question or two. While it 
seems to me that the friendly relations between Mr. Deng 
Xiaoping and you was an important factor making it possible to 
establishing CITIC, I am interested to know who was the first 
leading member of the Communist Party with whom you became 
intimate after liberation. In the first place, was it Mr. Deng 
Xiaoping or Mr. Zhou Enlai with whom you first became very 
intimate after liberation, or whose personality made you feel 
that the Communist Party is rather acceptable? 
  [Rong] While I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Deng 
Xiaoping from time to time at central government meetings, I 
should say Marshal Chen Yi was the first Communist Party leader 
I met. Then, of course, I had the opportunity of meeting with a 
number of leaders such as Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou 
Enlai, President Liu Shaoqi, and even Marshal Zhu De. In many 
cases, I was urgently summoned to discuss China's government 
policies. Thus, I have been associating with Communist Party 
leaders for several scores of years. 
<H5>  I Do Not Agree With the "Great China Economic Sphere" </H5>
  [Takano] Though this is my assumption, your relatives are 
scattered throughout the world creating a network. Has such a 
network proved effective for development of CITIC? 
  [Rong] Though I suppose the network played its role to a 
certain extent, I understand that the China Government's opening 
up policy was the main cause for the development. 
  At first, to explain the idea of organizing CITIC, I 
immediately visited, upon obtaining State Council approval, 
Germany -- it was West Germany at that time -- France, 
Switzerland, Japan, the United States, and Australia. To my 
explanation that China was going to open up its door to foreign 
countries, the foreign people accepted my explanation as very 
fresh news, and told me it was an excellent determination for 
China. I understand that the Chinese Government's opening up 
policy is a very proper way for China's economic development, 
making it possible to introduce and absorb foreign enterprises. 
  As you know, I was CITIC chairman before I became PRC vice 
president, and I feel that the PRC Government's opening up 
policy was one of the motive powers which helped CITIC develop 
to its present level. Another motive power was the effort 
exerted by all CITIC staff members. The third motive power was 
the fact that foreign enterprises had become fully confident 
that the PRC's opening up policy would never be changed in the 
future. 
  [Takano] My next question refers to the comment you just 
made. Particularly since 1991 and 1992, large business groups 
consisting of so called "huaqiao" [Overseas Chinese] and 
"huaren" [people of Chinese descent] have been actively 
expanding their investments in China. A world conference of 
Chinese businessmen will be held in Hong Kong at the end of 
November 1993. What do you think is the role to be played by 
the Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent living abroad 
in achieving China's economic development, and in promoting 
CITIC's business activities? 
  [Rong] Generally speaking, the Overseas Chinese problem is 
very complicated. We use the expression "huaren" for those 
Overseas Chinese who have obtained the citizenship of the 
countries where they live, and we hope they engage in their 
business abiding by the laws of the countries where they live. 
They are of course welcome if they want to contribute to their 
motherland through their business activities and investments. 
  We use the expression "huaqiao" for those Chinese living in 
foreign countries who have not obtained the citizenship of the 
host country. We also want them to carry out their business 
firmly abiding by the laws of the respective countries. Of 
course, they are welcome to exert themselves for the benefit of 
their motherland. 
  As to the world conference of Chinese businessmen to be held 
in Hong Kong you referred to earlier, I understand it is the 
second conference. The first was held in Singapore. We did not 
originally propose the conference. 
  [Takano] Recently, Japanese newspapers and magazines have 
frequently been using the expression, "great China economic 
sphere." It is a very common recognition in Japan that 
something like an invisible economic sphere is being formed by 
the network of Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent 
taking part in the Chinese economy's development, which is 
considered a very important factor in supporting the future 
development of China's economy. Because of your position, I feel 
that you are using a discreet expression, being afraid that it 
might be taken as a Chinese threat if the Chinese merchants' 
power became too strong throughout the world. Yet, what is your 
opinion about the potential of an "invisible economic network"? 
  [Rong] Let me explain my opinion from two points. 
  First, I want to take the example of Taiwan. Taiwan is part 
of China. Hong Kong is to be returned to China in 1997. Macao 
is also to be returned to China in 1999. To me, it seems very 
natural that these three areas keep very close economic 
relations with China. From such a standpoint, we are hoping to 
maintain cooperative relations with the respective areas, and to 
exchange opinions as to how to attain mutual development. 
  Second, as I just referred to the problem of Overseas 
Chinese 
and people of Chinese descent, we do not want to use the 
expression "great China economic sphere," and we do not agree 
with such an idea. 
<H5>  Macrocontrol Should Be Strengthened </H5>
  [Takano] By the way, it seems that the Chinese economy has 
developed too rapidly, creating an overheated situation, or 
creating a bubble economy-like condition in the real estate 
field. What is your opinion about the present situation and the 
problem points of the Chinese economy? 
  [Rong] The shift from the planned economy to a market 
economy is a very serious conversion creating various problems 
during the process. Yet, it is considered natural and 
inevitable that such problems are taking place. Since China is 
totally unfamiliar with a socialist market economy, having 
absolutely no experience in history, and as there is no such 
example in foreign countries from which we can learn lessons, 
the PRC Government is groping, or trying to find a way, as 
development is taking place. Problems always occur in the 
process, and it may be inevitable for us to keep moving while 
repeating this problem-solving process. 
  In the process of development, every district throughout the 
country became more enthusiastic, making active investment and 
exerting themselves for the betterment of enterprises. Although 
such enthusiasm is understandable, the only problem is that the 
people tend to be hasty and to expect a quick return, thus 
creating an overheated condition or, in certain fields, making 
excessive investments. China being, originally, a developing 
country, its economic structure is not so well-balanced. 
Therefore, if an excessive investment takes place at a 
particular field, it will create a further imbalance in the 
economic structure which was originally out of balance. 
Particularly, there has been an active request for investment 
in various fields, creating a further shortage of funds. On the 
other hand, however, we even experienced confusion in the 
monetary order because the Chinese legal system is imperfect. 
  Also, it is my opinion that the real estate sector, which 
you 
referred to before as being overheated, is a sector in China 
which should be further developed. However, as there is no 
established commercial practice [concerning real estate 
transactions] in China, the real estate market has been left 
uncontrolled, bringing about the rise of real estate prices with 
only a few people monopolizing the business. Therefore, the 
Chinese Government has decided to employ a macropolicy to 
strengthen macrocontrol. I think the situation has been 
improved to some extent. 
  [Takano] I suppose that the introduction of foreign 
investment will play a more important role for China's future 
development. Though investment from all over the world will 
naturally be welcome to China, which countries do you think most 
preferable to make investment in China? 
  [Rong] As we are taking an omnidirection policy in opening 
up our door to foreign countries, any country is welcome as long 
as it is willing to cooperate with China for mutual development. 
Since China is a developing country, we want to promote, based 
on our open policy, economic exchanges with foreign countries; 
and we think it will be wonderful if, for instance, we can 
improve our managerial skills through introduction of advanced 
scientific technologies. 
  We would like to cooperate with Japan, the United States, 
and 
Europe. However, in view of the geological location and the 
cultural history, it is considered easier and more convenient 
for China to establish a cooperative relation with Japan. Yet, 
as far as we see the present amount of investment by country, 
the United States ranks at the top, exceeding Japan. I 
earnestly hope that the Japanese investors will invest more in 
China. 
<H5>  The People Enjoy the Benefits of the Opening Up Policy </H5>
  [Takano] I understand that the Chinese Government is 
exerting efforts in various ways to solve the problem of 
economic differentials between the coastal and inland areas, 
which have recently tended to expand. Are you also trying to 
ensure, domestically, a well-balanced distribution of funds 
invested by foreign countries? 
  [Rong] It is true that China's opening up policy is being 
applied to the coastal areas first, and is to be gradually 
spread to the inner areas. Particularly, it is necessary to 
develop the social infrastructure in the inner areas. However, 
it requires a vast amount of investment, also necessitating a 
very long period for redemption. We intend to gradually improve 
the investment environment, keeping pace with the promotion of 
the opening up policy. 
  [Takano] In Japan, we use the expression "post-Deng 
Xiaoping." Some people are afraid that political and economic 
confusion might take place in China with the end of the Deng 
Xiaoping era. May I frankly ask you about your opinion on this 
point? 
  [Rong] China has attained its development centering around 
economic construction, and the people's standard of living has 
been further improved during the process. Around 1978, "the 
Three Sacred Treasures" of the Chinese people were a bicycle, a 
radio, and a sewing machine. Recently, they are a television, a 
refrigerator, and a washing machine. Presently, the standard of 
living has been further elevated with an air-conditioner, a 
piano, and a camera becoming necessities of life for all the 
people. 
  Since the fruits of China's opening up policy are being most 
enjoyed by the people, it is certain that the people will oppose 
Chinese Government leaders unless they continue to promote 
economic construction. Of course, there may be a variety of 
opinions among individual people, which should be considered 
natural. 
  [Takano] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong: "The </F>
Letter and the Spirit"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong -- A few months ago, one of Hong Kong's 
pro- China newspapers published a series of supplements which 
purported to chronicle Britain's departure from Empire. The 
authorised Beijing version told a story of imperial cunning, in 
which Britain's whole conspiratorial purpose had been to prolong 
her influence through delayed-action detonation of chaos 
wherever the Queen's writ had once run. Now, allegedly, we are 
doing the same in Hong Kong. 
  It's a bizarre view of our colonial history: a history in 
which we laid down the imperial burden with so little fuss and 
such genial intentions to install and safeguard the institutions 
of a plural society. 
  In Hong Kong, we are bringing the story almost to an end. 
Hong Kong, of course, is unlike our other colonies. Though no 
one could doubt the capacity of this great city, it has never 
enjoyed the prospect of independence. History and geography 
have spelt out another future, the assumption of Chinese 
sovereignty in 1997. This has determined and constrained 
political and institutional development in the territory. While 
it has been governed under the eyes of Parliament at 
Westminster, its own democratic evolution has been limited by 
its historic destination. In the 1940s and 1950s, proposals 
that would have given Hong Kong similar democratic institutions 
to those being established elsewhere in our Empire were rudely 
halted by noises from the north which warned against any 
political course of action which might encourage the community 
to think that it could determine its own future. 
  So democracy was never really on the agenda until we came to 
negotiate the terms of the transfer of sovereignty. At the 
heart of those negotiations was the promise that, while China's 
flag would be run up over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, the 
community itself would enjoy a high degree of autonomy and would 
keep its way of life. 'One country, two systems' was Deng 
Xiaoping's vision--a goal which Hong Kong and Britain could 
readily share. 
  The Joint Declaration -- the treaty signed by Britain and 
China -- spelt out Hong Kong's freedoms and values and the way 
to secure them. It promised an executive answerable to the 
legislature, and a legislature wholly composed through election. 
Admittedly, it did not say those elections should be open and 
fair. Could anyone at the negotiating table have thought 
otherwise? Nor did it spell out how these elections should be 
conducted. 
  Here lies the nub of our present argument with China. Some 
people--including almost every directly elected legislator 
here-- think we should be arguing with China about quickening 
the pace of democracy in Hong Kong. I understand why they think 
this, but do not believe that this would have been a possible 
option so late in the day. The principle of a growing degree of 
democracy is already agreed with China, and set out in the Basic 
Law--China's mini- constitution for Hong Kong after 1997. What 
we are in effect debating is whether or not the agreed process 
of democratisation should be credible and fair. It was with 
that aim that we put forward in October 1992 very modest 
proposais (which we were always willing to discuss with China) 
on the detailed electoral arrangements for Hong Kong in 1994 and 
1995. 
  Let me summarise where we are, just over a year after we 
first put forward these ideas. We did not dream up this issue 
at the last moment. By mid-1992, the precise voting 
arrangements for the last elections under British sovereignty 
had not been agreed, presumably because they were extremely 
difficult. According to independent legal advisers giving 
evidence to the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, our 
plans are wholly consistent with Britain's agreements and 
understandings with China. In over 160 hours of talks with 
Beijing, we have offered conditionally to change our proposals 
but have seen no similar offer of concession or accommodation 
from the other side of the table. Now, with time running out 
and the first of a three-part series of elections less than a 
year away, we have introduced legislation to deal with the least 
contentious parts of our plan. Despite Chinese hostility to a 
course of action which they know is necessary to meet the 
legislative timetable, we still want to continue negotiating 
about the more awkward items of the electoral arrange ments on 
which, alas, no progress has been made in seven months of 
negotiation. 
  Through a year of harsh statements from Beijing, the 
majority 
of people in Hong Kong have remained calm and supportive of our 
approach. And opinion in Britain -- in Parliament and outside 
it -- has remained largely supportive, too. But some criticisms 
have been raised--as you would expect in an open and free 
society--both in Britain and Hong Kong. 
  First, there are those who argue that somehow our 
difficulties with China all coincided with the arrival of the 
author as Governor of Hong Kong. I acknowledge that I have a 
vested interest here, but have to beg to differ. It is no 
criticism at all of my predecessor to point out that the log-jam 
of issues in the Joint Liaison Group, and the difficulties over 
Hong Kong's new airport, pre-dated my hatless disembarkation. 
Indeed, most would say that the current uneasy relationship 
with China goes back to Tiananmen Square and the reaction of 
Hong Kong people to that event. 
  Second, some contend that we should not imperil the wider 
Sino-British relationship -- particularly the trade relationship 
--by disagreements with China over Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is 
the largest single component in that relationship, and the most 
important one. Our responsibilities to Hong Kong's citizens 
must come first. In the longer term, our standing in China and 
Asia is likely to be strongly affected by how decently we 
undertake our responsibilities in Hong Kong. There is no 
reason, in any case, why disagreements over Hong Kong should 
affect the wider relationship. China would be foolish indeed if, 
as she seeks to enter the Gatt, she were to choose to 
discriminate against British trade. China's President Jiang 
Zemin rightly argued to President Clinton at their recent summit 
that politics and trade should be kept separate; what's true in 
Seattle is just as true in Beijing. 
  Nor should we think that there is an arithmetical 
relationship between diplomatic harmony and economic benefits, 
desirable as both may be. From the mid-Eighties until last 
year, we actually saw a steady fall in our exports to China and 
a rise in China's exports to Britain. A surplus for Britain has 
turned into a two-to-one surplus for China. In 1993, at last, 
our exports actually started to rise sharply again. 
  Third, some people suggest (a touch undiplomatically) that 
China is capable of behaving thuggishly if she doesn't get her 
own way; and that we should therefore do whatever she wants 
after a suitably decorous effort to put our own point of view. 
If necessary, we can always mask retreat on a matter of 
substance with some gracefully opaque form of words. You don't 
have to summon from history craven examples of this attitude to 
reject it. We have responsibilities to Hong Kong. They are 
incorporated in the Joint Declaration. When ministers signed 
the Joint Declaratio n-- and Parliament endorsed it -- they took 
the view, reasonably enough, that it meant what it so eloquently 
said. The gradual development of democracy in Hong Kong has 
been a consistent aim of the British Government since 1984. As 
Richard Luce put it in the House of Commons in December that 
year: `We all fully accept that we should build up a firmly 
based democratic administration in Hong Kong in the years 
between now and 1997.' Or as Geoffrey Howe expressed it in 
1989: `We have always sought to develop representative 
government in line with the wishes of the community as a whole 
and to ensure that what is achieved under British administration 
is firm and durable.' I take that view too, and am trying to 
make sure this treaty, to which Britain put her name, is 
implemented--to the letter and in the spirit. 
  Fourth, it is argued that if only we weren't having today's 
argument with China, all in Hong Kong would be peace and 
harmony. But how much stability would we have earned ourselves 
through a rotten deal which compromised Hong Kong's electoral 
arrangements? We could have spent our last years of sovereignty 
defending the indefensible against every pro-democracy 
politician in Hong Kong and against critical or cynical opinion 
at Westminster and world-wide. Events between now and 1997 would 
have made life increasingly uncomfortable for a government which 
would have lost its authority. 
  Fifth, there is the patronising argument that people in Hong 
Kong are only interested in money; that they don't care about 
democracy; and that clean elections are irrelevant to Hong 
Kong's long-term prosperity as her economy converges with that 
of the Chinese hinterland. 
  Naturally, Hong Kong families want peace and quiet, like 
families everywhere else. But whenever they have been given the 
chance they have voted for more democracy, not less. Their 
aspirations are modest and they are moderately expressed, yet 
they clearly recognise that what makes Hong Kong special, what 
makes it unique, is the rule of law and the freedoms of a plural 
society. A decently elected legislature is a part of that 
fabric. If there is no level playing- field for the 
legislature, what chance of a level playing-field elsewhere -- 
in business, for example? The promise that Hong Kong people 
will run Hong Kong after 1997, with a substantial degree of 
autonomy, hardly squares with efforts to install an electoral 
system which would give Beijing tight control. 
  We hear one other argument against behaving decently. It 
tends to come from those who used to urge Britain to stand 
taller for democracy, until, that is, China started to shout the 
odds. What matters, we are told, is freedom not democracy -- 
freedom of speech, freedom of economic choice, freedom under the 
law. Standing up for fair elections may risk these freedoms. 
  But what sort of freedom would Hong Kong have if its 
citizens 
didn't have the freedom to make a real choice in the 
polling-booth? What fair economic choice is there when there is 
no fearless legislative opponent of corruption? Can we really 
expect freedom of speech and of the press to survive long if 
there is no freedom to express political views in a fairly 
elected legislature? It is not the argument for democracy which 
these critics regard as a step too far, but the determination to 
stand up for Hong Kong. 
  We will continue to try to persuade the Chinese to return to 
the negotiating table. If we fail, we shall have to work out 
with the people of Hong Kong, through the Legislative Council, 
the best arrangements for securing limited democracy. We won't 
be able to go further than they are prepared to go, but nor 
should we go less far. Of course, it is true that we could put 
in place arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 elections and see 
them cast aside by China after 1997 in its first act of 
sovereignty. Beijing officials last month once again threatened 
to do precisely this--in blatant contradiction of their own 
post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong. But the argument that 
China may act against Hong Kong's interests (and its own) in the 
future cannot be a persuasive argument for us to do the same 
today. Moreover, if we have a credible system, why should China 
want to remove from elected office in 1997 men and women who 
will have been elected by their fellow citizens? This is hardly 
the best way of winning hearts and minds. 
  Hong Kong has been a spectacular success story--largely the 
result of Shanghainese and Cantonese entrepreneurialism combined 
with the values of a plural society. Provided this combination 
survives the transition through 1997, Hong Kong should be 
uniquely placed to contribute further to China's successful 
opening up to the world. Hong Kong should be able to play a 
similar role for China at the beginning of the next century to 
that played by New York for the United States at the opening of 
this one. It is set to be the merchant bank and the business 
centre for the region; if, that is, China learns to trust Hong 
Kong and not to treat it with truculent suspicion. 
  In the next three and a half years, we still have to try to 
dispel that cloud of suspicion while China itself is going 
through a period of accelerating change. That task will not be 
easy. I believe we can do it, so long as we are prepared when 
necessary to stand up for Hong Kong and not assume that its 
interests in either the short or long term are best served by 
bending to every wind from the north.

<F P=106> [By WEN WEI PO special correspondent in Paris Cheng Jo-lin </F>
(6774 5387 7792): "Interviewed by Our Reporters Before Leaving 
for Beijing, French Special Envoy Talks About Two Missions on 
His China Trip"] 
  [Text] Paris, 26 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Alain Peyrefitte, 
special envoy of French Prime Minister Balladur, is leaving on a 
visit to Beijing today. When interviewed by our reporters 
before leaving, he said during his visit to China that he will 
make preparations with the Chinese authorities for Edouard 
Balladur to visit China. He also hinted that the French prime 
minister's March visit will be very important. "Some concrete 
achievements will be made during the visit," he said. 
  Alain Peyrefitte is a member of the French National 
Assembly, 
an academic, a LE FIGARO editorial writer, and a former minister 
with the government of General Charles de Gaulle. He has 
written a variety of books about China, including one entitled 
"When China Awakes..." He has many readers in France and is one 
of the best known China experts in his country. 
  He told our reporters that the French prime minister expects 
that concrete achievements will be made in both the political 
and economic fields during his China visit. "We hope we can 
bring some contracts back to our country. With regard to 
technology in the fields of energy, communication, and 
telecommunication, which are three crucial fields for China's 
economic construction, France is the most powerful country or 
one of the most powerful countries in the world. For this 
reason, there are good prospects for cooperation between France 
and China." 
  Talking about the goals of his Beijing visit, Peyrefitte 
said: "I have been designated by Prime Minister Balladur this 
time to visit Beijing with two missions. First, to celebrate 
the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between France and China. No ceremonies were held by 
any of the two to mark the 20th and 25th anniversaries of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations, because Sino-French 
relations were good at that time and there was no need to do so. 
But this time, some difficulties have appeared between the two 
countries. Therefore, it is necessary to dispel the dark clouds 
over the two countries and turn a new page in history. A 
historic day for both countries was 27 January 1964. On that 
day, France and China issued a joint communique on the 
establishment of normal diplomatic relations. The purpose of 
celebrating this historical date is to reestablish good 
relations of mutual trust between France and China. Members of 
my delegation include Philippe de Gaulle, son of General Charles 
de Gaulle and a member of the National Assembly, (Clode Chaille) 
[ke luo de xia ye 0344 3157 1795 1115 0673], who built the 
French Embassy in China 30 years ago, and other people who have 
rendered contributions to the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between France and China." 
  "My second mission is to make preparations for Prime 
Minister 
Balladur's visit to China. I will discuss with the Chinese 
authorities such matters as the itinerary of Balladur's visit 
and the agenda for talks. Of course, this also includes the 
date of the visit and concrete achievements to be made, because 
this will be a very important visit, which cannot yield no 
concrete results." 
  He pointed out: "I believe that resuming a relationship of 
mutual trust will benefit both countries, France and China, 
alike. This relationship of mutual trust has been established 
through great efforts over the past many years, which can be 
traced back to 1963 when General de Gaulle began to take action 
and sent his special envoy Fuer [fu er 1381 1422] to China to 
seek the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with 
China. As a result, France became the first Western power to 
recognize the People's Republic of China [as published; Britain 
established diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1954 at charge 
d'affaires level]." Alain Peyrefitte continued: "In recent 
years, as France first sold a destroyer and then Mirage planes 
to Taiwan, bilateral relations have been harmed. Therefore, it 
is important to repair the friendly relations between France and 
China now. I am pleased to see that both sides have finally 
ironed out their disputes arising from arms sales to Taiwan." 
  Referring to France-Taiwan relations, Peyrefitte pointed 
out: 
In 1963, General de Gaulle began to take action and sent his 
special envoy (Fuer) to China to seek the possibility of 
establishing diplomatic relations with China. At that time, 
both Beijing and Taipei held that there was only one, 
inseparable China. Taipei always held it had sovereignty over 
the mainland. To France, this was obviously not in conformity 
with reality. 
  A reporter asked: Former French Foreign Minister Dumas of 
the Socialist government said some days ago that when he was 
minister of foreign affairs, he promised to China that 
Lafayette, the destroyer sold to Taiwan, would not be equipped 
with weapons. Therefore, he criticized the Balladur Government 
for breaking the promises he had made to China on behalf of 
France. What is your comment on this? 
  Peyrefitte replied: According to the files and relevant 
documents I have read, I feel that Mr. Dumas might be frank and 
honest when talking about this issue, because he did not know 
that, at that time, the French Government had reached a secret 
agreement with Taiwan on this issue. This secret agreement was 
included in the contract with Taiwan. According to the secret 
agreement, if Taiwan was unable to fit out weapons on the 
destroyer sold by France, it would ask France to bear 
responsibility. What I want to explain is that it is not the 
Balladur government which has taken action to equip those ships 
with weapons, because it does not conform to the government's 
policy. On the contrary, having knowledge of this agreement 
after assuming office, Balladur realized immediately that this 
was something that should be changed.... That is why he 
believes that reestablishing a relationship of mutual trust with 
China is very important. 
  Peyrefitte also told our reporters that France is confident 
that economic cooperation and trade with China will be rapidly 
increased and France will be able to regain its lost share of 
the Chinese market due to the sale of fighters to Taiwan. 
  He pointed out: France was the first Western power to 
recognize China. The late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, whom I 
met several times in 1971, once told me that "when French 
enterprises come to China, under conditions of competition on an 
equal basis and so long as the price and quality are the same, 
we will give them first consideration." However, French 
enterprises have not made full use of this. Since 1981, France 
has been going backwards in the Chinese market. In those years, 
France occupied some 4 percent of the Chinese market, which was 
already rather low. But now its share has dropped to as low as 
1.8 percent. It has dropped by 2.2 percent in the past decade. 
But this was still the figure before the arms sales to Taiwan. 
Since then, because of China's economic sanctions, France's 
Chinese market occupation rate has been dropping from 1.8 
percent toward zero. Therefore, I hope that with the 
improvement of Sino-French relations, this important share can 
rise a little bit. Especially, as in the same period, the share 
of the Chinese market occupied by Germany, Italy, and other 
countries have been increasing rapidly. Yet France's has 
dropped to as low as those of Romania or Belgium. To France, 
this is incredible.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen this evening hosted a banquet 
here in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the 
establishment of Sino- French diplomatic relations and in honor 
of Alain Peyrefitte, visiting special envoy of French Prime 
Minister Balladur. 
  Qian made clear at the banquet that the maintenance of Sino- 
French friendly relations of cooperation is not only in the 
basic interest of the two peoples, but also beneficial to world 
peace, stability and economic development. 
  Qian said that 30 years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and Charles 
de Gaulle made the historic decision for the establishment of 
Sino- French diplomatic relations with the foresight and 
sagacity of great statesmanship, despite all obstacles. 
  While reviewing the development of Sino-French relations 
today, he added, we feel stronger that the decision made by 
leaders of both countries at that time was right and fitting 
with historical trends. 
  Qian noted that the agreement reached between the two 
governments not long ago has turned a new page on Sino-French 
relations. 
  Qian pointed out that China and France, sharing the same or 
similar views on many important international issues, should 
strengthen consultations and coordination. 
  He said that China attaches great importance as always to 
relations with France, holding that Sino-French relations should 
have an eye not only on the present, but also on the next 
century. 
  He added that the long maintenance of stable Sino-French 
friendly relations of cooperation is a factor for world peace 
and balance. 
  Qian noted that China and France share strong economic 
complementarity, which embodies a vast potential for bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation, in hopes that more French 
enterprises and corporations come to China to invest and conduct 
business. 
  He said that Chinese leaders are hoping for French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur to visit China, voicing that the 
visit, an important event in bilateral relations, will further 
accelerate and promote an overall restoration and development of 
Sino-French relations. 
  Peyrefitte and his party arrived here this morning to 
participate in commemorative activities for the 30th anniversary 
of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations and to 
make preparations for Balladur's visit to China. 
  At the banquet, Peyrefitte said that shadows over bilateral 
relations in the past few years have been cleared now, so both 
France and China are ready to hold grand memorial activities to 
mark the anniversary. 
  He continued that during the past 30 years, the world, China 
and France have all experienced changes, but China and France 
are not the same as other countries for France is the sole 
oldest country in the Western world and China is the sole oldest 
country in Asia, and both countries have their experiences and 
influence, which cannot be measured by population and gross 
national product. 
  He said that since 1978 when China started its drive toward 
modernization, reform and opening up, its efforts have resulted 
in a surprising and sustained economic growth, which has won 
China many friends. 
  He pointed out that, as old friends, France and China have 
become frank friends again after removing misunderstandings 
today. 
  Peyrefitte at last quoted a Chinese saying, with a wish for 
Sino- French friendship to "last forever". 
  French Senator and Admiral Philippe de Gaulle also made a 
speech at the banquet, saying that the decision made by his 
father, former President Charles de Gaulle, in 1964 to establish 
diplomatic relations with China was a symbol of an independent 
foreign policy followed by a sovereign France. 
  The concept of national independence is the one most 
remarkable common point shared by the two peoples, he added. 
  He continued that, compared with 1964, today's China, a big 
country in politics and culture and an economic giant 
accelerating its construction as set out by Mr. Deng Xiaoping, 
occupies a more prominent position in history and cultivation. 
  He voiced that both countries have more reasons than in 1964 
to maintain and develop friendly relations set up in the past. 
  Present at the banquet were Power Industry Minister Shi 
Dazhen, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan and 
French Ambassador to China Francois Plaisant. 
  Before the banquet, Qian met with Peyrefitte and his party, 
praising Peyrefitte for his efforts in pushing forward the 
development of Sino-French relations and enhancing understanding 
and friendship between the two peoples during the past 30 years. 
  He noted that Sino-French relations have played a 
constructive, stable and balancing role in the world during the 
past 30 years, whose importance has exceeded bilateral relations 
and should be exercised even more in the current new world 
situation. 
  Qian pointed out that history will prove the rightness of 
the 
decision on normalization of Sino-French relations made by Prime 
Minister Balladur. 
  He welcomed French enterprises to take part in equal 
competition on the Chinese market, saying that China is 
witnessing a high economic growth rate. 
  Peyrefitte said that Balladur has pushed bilateral relations 
back onto a normal track, hoping his visit to China would be 
fruitful. 
  This afternoon, Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei held 
talks 
with Peyrefitte.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng stressed here today that China and France should develop 
their bilateral relations with an eye on the 21st century. 
  The Chinese premier made the statement during his meeting 
with Alain Peyrefitte, special envoy of French Prime Minister 
Balladur, who presented a letter from Balladur to the Chinese 
premier. 
  Li said that the two countries, both influential nations in 
the world without conflict of fundamental interests, should 
strengthen bilateral cooperation in the drastically changing 
international situation. 
  The Chinese premier expressed the hope that the two sides 
would take a positive and practical attitude and explore new 
ways to broaden cooperation. 
  Li paid high tribute to the positive contributions made by 
Mr. Peyrefitte to the improvement of the Sino-French relations. 
  Mr. Peyrefitte said that the historic decision to establish 
diplomatic relations with China taken by General Charles de 
Gaulle 30 years ago is still of great significance and the 
bilateral relations have been brought onto a normal track after 
a period of difficulties and the traditional friendly 
cooperation has been restored. 
  Li Peng said that the correct decision of establishing 
diplomatic relations between the two countries made by Chairman 
Mao Zedong and President de Gaulle with foresight and sagacity 
of great statesmen opened up a new stage of development in the 
bilateral ties. 
  Li said that the relations of the two countries have been 
good in general, with great development of cooperation in every 
field. 
  Li expressed the hope that the forthcoming visit by French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur would be a complete success. 
  Peyrefitte said that France admires China's economic 
development and French enterprises are willing to take an active 
part in China's economic construction. 
  The economic and trade relations are sure to be further 
enhanced, he stated.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The uncooperative 
attitude the British Government is taking on the Hong Kong issue 
is likely to affect Sino-British trade ties, said Wu Yi, 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. 
  Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Information 
Office of the State Council here this morning that the bilateral 
trade relations are not bad on the whole, and the potential for 
their development is also great. 
  Last year, the bilateral trade volume reached 3.59 billion 
U.S. dollars, an increase of 86 percent over the previous year. 
  However, Wu said, it is very difficult to say that the 
uncooperative attitude the British Government is taking would 
not affect the bilateral trade ties. 
  The situation is what the Chinese side would not like to 
see, 
and the British side should shoulder the whole responsibility in 
this regard.

  [Text] Vienna, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, visiting 
chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing 
Committee, held talks here today with Heinz Fischer, president 
of the National Council of Austria. 
  The talks mainly focused on the growth of bilateral 
relations 
and exchanges between the two parliaments. 
  A NPC official said the talks proceeded "in a cordial and 
friendly atmosphere." 
  Qiao said the relations between China and Austria have been 
good since they established diplomatic ties in 1971. 
  Recent years see new development of such relationship thanks 
to the efforts made by Fischer, Qiao said. 
  He noted that the two sides have shared identical or similar 
views on most of the issues. 
  Qiao expressed the belief that his visit to Austria will 
surely help increase mutual understanding and friendship and 
contribute to the development of the two countries in every 
field. 
  Fischer described Qiao's visit to Austria as "a very 
important event in the history of bilateral ties." 
  He said the two countries have a long history of contacts, 
adding that it is worthwhile for the two countries to establish 
diplomatic ties. 
  Austria pays great attention to China's development, he 
said, 
adding that China's economic growth in the past or in the future 
is of great significance to the whole Europe. 
  During the talks, Qiao also expounded his view on the human 
rights issue. 
  Fischer expressed his understanding of China's position on 
this issue. Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing 
Committee, and Heide Schmidt, the third president of the 
National Council of Austria, were present at the meeting. 
  Also today, Qiao met with Robert Lichael, the second 
president of the National Council of Austria, and other leaders 
of the Austrian parliament.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Following the 
successful implementation of its first farmland protection 
program, south China's Guangdong Province recently launched a 
new drive in that line. 
  The new plan aims to set the province's cultivated area at 
2.5 million by 1997, when the present provincial government will 
end its term. 
  Governments at all levels in the province have been asked to 
sign "responsibility contracts" with the provincial government 
to see to it that they will carry out the new plan properly, 
according to official sources. 
  The province's first farmland protection program was carried 
out between 1991 and 1992. The sources said that by the end of 
1992, the province had 2,547,000 ha of farmland, which was 0.52 
percent more than the preset goal. 
  With the area of farmland continuing to shrink as a result 
of 
the steady March of industrialization onto its land space, and 
the ever increasing demands for food supplies to the swelling 
urban population, the southern province is facing mounting 
pressure to protect its limited farmland. 
  The provincial government also demanded that governments at 
all levels speed up the implementation of the regulation on the 
setting up of farmland protection areas, which was passed by the 
provincial people's congress last September and aims to put 
under strict protection some two million ha of farmland 
considered "essential" to its grain production. 
  As only 40 percent of the work has been completed so far, 
the 
provincial government ordered that all the cities must complete 
the work by June. Those failing to do so would not be permitted 
to take any farmland for non-agricultural construction, the 
sources said. 
  In another development, the provincial government decided 
that it would reclaim 47,000 ha of new farmland from 1993 to 
1997, and that a special fund would be established for the 
better development of its land resources.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556): "Guangdong </F>
Provincial People's Congress Decides To Strengthen Legislation 
on Real Estate Market"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--An 
official of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial 
People's Congress disclosed that the congress will lay stress on 
strengthening legislation on the real estate market in its 
legislative work this year. The Standing Committee of the 
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress which starts tomorrow 
will examine and discuss three such regulations. 
  These three regulations are: "Regulations on the Transfer of 
Real Estates in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province," 
"Regulations on House Renting in Towns and Cities of Guangdong 
Province," and "Regulations on Real Estate Ownership 
Registration in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province." 
  The real estate regulation promulgated and put into force by 
the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress last month was 
"Regulations on Real Estate Development and Management in 
Guangdong Province." 
  According to the official of the people's congress, although 
four rules and regulations have been promulgated by the 
provincial government and people's congress in the past two 
years and more to standardize the real estate market, the 
question of lacking sufficient laws and regulations for real 
estates remains serious at present. 
  The official of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress 
gave examples to show that the question of the real estate 
transfer market is quite conspicuous at present. First, taking 
advantage of land acquisition, some grass-roots governments have 
acquired land from peasants at low pricse and then sold it to 
land developers at high prices to reap staggering profits. This 
has resulted in disturbances or fights with weapons. Last year, 
land acquisition in Huizhou City alone caused nine incidents of 
disturbances and fights with weapons, involving over 100 people 
each, wounding 20 cadres and over 100 people, and resulting in a 
direct economic loss amounting to 1 million yuan. Second, the 
question of illegal land transfer is serious in towns and 
townships. On one occasion, several square kilometers of land 
were illegally transferred in a certain village in Buji Town of 
Shenzhen City. Third, illegal sales and transfer of commodity 
housing are serious and such practice harms the interests of the 
consumers. Fourth, fraud in real estate transactions carried 
out by lawbreakers are often found. 
  It is disclosed that the three regulations to be examined 
and 
discussed by the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial 
People's Congress tomorrow will include detailed provisions on a 
series of issues such as the transfer, renting, and ownership 
registration of real estates.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506) from </F>
Shenzhen: "Customs Inpsection Line Moved Back to the Second Line 
to Make Way for Building of a Large Bonded Area"] 
  [Text] Authorities concerned confirmed that Shenzhen will 
become the mainland's largest bonded area pursuing a Hong 
Kong-style free-trade policy after 1997, when Luohu Customs 
(first line) will be moved back to the site of the current 
second line, effectively extending the special economic zone 
from the present 327 to 2,020 sq m, to boost the reserve 
strength for the development of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. 
  Sources say the Shenzhen City CPC Committee has drawn up an 
outline of the idea, to which Deng Xiaoping responded: "Must Do 
(go ahead)!" 
  Jiang Zemin, mainland state president and CPC general 
secretary, and State Council Premier Li Peng also agreed to the 
concept. 
  By this concept, after 1997, people with Shenzhen permanent 
residency and a permit issued by a local policing unit can 
travel freely into and out of Luohu Customs. Foreign goods 
shipped in through Luohu Customs will not count as imports and 
will be exempted from import duties (except a few commodities 
such as tobacco and wine). In Shenzhen, mainland people can 
catch a glimpse of trade commodities from all over the world. 
Similarly, mainland domestic products shipped from the Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone will not be seen as exports. Foreign 
businessmen will have a chance to observe trade in all good 
domestically made products in Shenzhen. 
  Shenzhen hopes to become a "365-day, forever open Guangzhou 
trade fair." 
  The outline, described as a "choice that spans the 
centuries," forecasts that by 2010 ,Shenzhen's per-capita GDP 
will reach $70,000, more than Shanghai's $30,000, Taiwan's 
$40,000, and Singapore's $60,000. The 1.2 billion mainland 
population will throw their weight behind the program to push 
Shenzhen ahead of the four Asian little dragons in 2010. 
  The $70,000 is the result of calculations on the World 
Bank's 
price parity theory (PPP) on four types of purchasing powers, 
not a lone estimate by the mainland. 
  The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone currently occupies 327 sq 
m. There is 160 sq m of land worth development, 100 of which are 
under actual development. Land use rights over the remaining 60 
sq m has been transferred with compensation. 
  The trend shows weak reserve strength for the Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone to sustain future development and the 
necessity of incorporating Baoan and Longgang Districts into the 
special zone, adding another 1,700 sq m of land. 
  However, there must be effective measures for operations 
against smuggling and personnel movement management in the 
future, or there will be a series of problems. 
  To abide by the general principle of "Hong Kong ruled by 
Hong 
Kong people," after 1997, the 3 million Shenzhen population will 
remain excluded from elections in Hong Kong. There is still a 
difference between "Hong Kong people" and "Shenzhen people." 
Only thus can Beijing keep its word to the whole world. 
  The idea of building a large bonded area was floated when 
Shenzhen discovered that there were no longer any preferential 
policies to speak of in the first special economic zone with the 
opening up of the entire mainland; also there had been talk of 
converging with Hong Kong with the approach of 1997. 
  Shenzhen was the second local government to raise such an 
idea. Hainan Province once suggested the concept of a "special 
customs area," which was shelved and finally rejected by Beijing 
last year. 
  Shenzhen officials stated that improvement of zone border 
management must start right away. It will take into account the 
experience of Hong Kong and bonded areas around the world, study 
it, draft relevant ordinances and policies, while picking the 
Shatoujiao and Futian bonded areas to undergo pilot projects in 
preparation for modern, international cities, experiences gained 
there will be popularized. 
  In fact, Shenzhen has started arranging for this year's 
investment "basket," which is leaning toward water, electricity, 
land transport, and communication and expanding resource 
allocations for ports, airports, highways, and high-speed 
railroads.

"Shenzhen Abolishes Three-Year Tax Exemption Preferential 
Treatment for Enterprises Engaged in Three Forms of Import 
Processing and Compensation Trade Set Up This Year"] 
  [Text] Enterprises from Hong Kong and Taiwan that are 
engaged in three forms of import processing and compensation 
trade are less and less welcomed by Shenzhen Special Economic 
Zone [SEZ]. Such enterprises founded after 1 January this year 
will no longer be entitled to the three-year tax exemption. 
  Zhang Jiashou [4545 1367 1108], deputy head of the foreign 
affairs department of Shenzhen City Tax Bureau, pointed out at 
an exclusive interview with this reporter yesterday that in the 
past, the SEZ exempted enterprises engaged in three forms of 
import processing and compensation trade from business tax on 
their processing fees for three years. With the introduction of 
the new tax regime this year, this preferential policy has been 
canceled. Though it remains valid for factories that were 
previously eligible for this tax remission treatment, similar 
enterprises founded this year will no longer be entitled to the 
same treatment. 
  He pointed out: This new measure has no impact on solely 
foreign-funded enterprises from Hong Kong and Taiwan, joint 
ventures, and cooperative enterprises. Because the recipients 
of processing fees are usually mainland factories, basically, 
this new measure is not expected to dampen the investment 
interest of Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers to any noticeable 
extent. 
  He explained that Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers 
normally 
transport raw materials to the mainland for processing. The 
consigned processor may be a mainland factory. Once the 
products are finished, they will be handed over to the Hong Kong 
or Taiwan manufacturer for export. In such an operation, the 
taxpayer should be the mainland factory, not the Hong Kong or 
Taiwan manufacturer. 
  He said: "Whoever is consigned processing, and receives 
processing fees for it, must pay business taxes. The rate of 
the processing fee is up to the manufacturers to decide and has 
nothing to do with the tax bureau." 
  He emphasized: If, because of the implementation of the new 
measure, an enterprise engaged in three forms of processing and 
compensation trade attempts to understate processing fees, it 
will be considered a tax evader once discovered and will be 
called to account. 
  This new measure may increase the tax burden on mainland 
factories and, in turn, may have an impact on the Hong Kong and 
Taiwan manufacturers to some degree. This policy can be seen as 
a sign that enterprises engaged in three forms of processing and 
compensation trade are no longer welcomed by the SEZ.

  [Text] Shenzhen, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen, a 
special economic zone in Guangdong Province, set a new record in 
its economic growth rate in 1993, the city government announced 
today. 
  The city's gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of 
goods 
and services produced -- amounted to 41.35 billion yuan last 
year, up 30 percent over 1992 and 17 percentage points higher 
than the nation's average, a city government official said. 
  The official said that per-capita GDP in Shenzhen was 15,000 
yuan, up 33.5 percent and six times the nation's average. 
  Special and flexible policies are being pursued in Shenzhen 
to attract investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas. 
  Shenzhen's industrial output value shot up nearly 35 percent 
in 1993 to 48 billion yuan, the official said. 
  The growth of collectively-owned manufacturers is the most 
impressive, he said. These manufacturers scored a near 90 
percent rise in total output value last year, much higher than 
both state- owned and foreign-funded manufacturers. 
  Meanwhile, economic returns of manufacturers of various 
types 
have improved markedly, he said. 
  For example, the comprehensive economic returns index for 
local manufacturers stood at 129.7 during the first 11 months of 
1993, up 28.16 points. 
  The official said that Shenzhen achieved a substantial 
increase in investment in fixed assets in 1993 -- estimated at 
19.5 billion yuan, a 38 percent increase over 1992. 
  Shenzhen spent a quarter of the investment building roads, 
bridges, a power plant and a waterworks, he said. 
  Expanded production and higher economic returns have enabled 
Shenzhen residents to enjoy higher living standards, he said. 
  The earnings of local residents averaged 589 yuan per person 
in 1993, up 9.3 percent in real terms, he said. 
  Moreover, the local market is brisk, with retail sales 
totalling 16 billion yuan last year, a rise of nearly 39 
percent, he said. 
  Shenzhen's revenue soared by almost 57 percent to 6.73 
billion yuan in 1993, he said. 
  Furthermore, the local financial order has turned for the 
better, the local foreign exchange swap market has been stable 
and money has been in ample supply, he said. 
  At the end of December, savings deposits in local banks 
totalled 65.74 billion yuan and loans extended amounted to 50 
billion yuan, he said.

  [Text] In 1993, Henan's revenue grew steadily, and stands 
at 13.79 billion yuan, an increase of 32.56 percent over the 
previous year; 17 prefectures and cities registered revenues of 
11.49 billion yuan, an increase of 32.5 over the previous year; 
provincial level revenues amounted to 2.3 billion yuan, an 
increase of 19.6 percent over the previous year. The province's 
revenue growth resulted from developments in production. The 
suspension of tax reductions and exemptions was also an 
important factor causing the growth. 
  Last year's financial expenditure throughout the province 
increased over the previous year. The main reason was that 
administrative institutions adjusted their wages beyond budgets 
and some city-level counties increased their spending for the 
construction of some basic facilities and transformation 
projects. In addition, as a result of lifting controls over 
grain prices, subsidies were provided to workers and staff 
members. This was also one of the reasons. 
  In August last year, principal leaders of governments at all 
levels in various localities began to implement central 
macrocontrol and regulatory measures, thus strictly controlling 
tax reductions and exemptions, gradually alleviating fund 
shortages, and bringing about monthly growth in industrial and 
commercial taxes on the basis of speedy economic development. 
By the end of last year, 10 cities and counties including 
Nanyang, Ruzhou, Gongyi, Luyi, and Shangqiu topped 100 million 
yuan in revenue, fulfilling the provincial plan ahead of 
schedule. Eleven enterprises including the Anyang steel 
company, the Luoyang glass factory, the Pingdingshan [words 
indistinct] factory, and the Henan [words indistinct] factory 
topped 100 million yuan in taxes. The number of 
100-million-yuan enterprises increased by seven over the 
previous year and 93 enterprises topped 10 million yuan in 
taxes, an increase of 13 over the previous year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Teng Mei-ling (6772 5019 3781): "`Peace </F>
Charter' Signatories Issue Statement Demanding Qin Yongmin's 
Release and Abolition of Reeducation-Through-Labor"] 
  [Text] Qin Yongmin, "Peace Charter" drafter, was recently 
sentenced by the mainland authorities to two years' reeducation- 
through-labor on a charge of "disturbing public order and 
security." The other 11 signatories of the "Peace Charter" 
yesterday issued a statement, denouncing the authorities for 
violating the civil rights of the people on the mainland as 
specified by the mainland Constitution and trampling on the 
mainland citizens' freedom of speech and assembly. Yang Zhou, 
one of the signatories, said that while telling the outside 
world that they were going to release prisoners, the mainland 
authorities continued to pass reeducation- through-labor 
sentences, showing that their deeds did not match their words. 
  In yesterday's statement, the "Peace Charter" signatories 
stressed that the action by the mainland authorities was one of 
trampling upon and mocking the mainland Constitution. The 
statement strongly demanded that the authorities release Qin 
Yongmin and abolish the reeducatioan-through-labor system. The 
main points of the statement are as follows: 
  1. The contents of the "Peace Charter" did not go beyond the 
limits allowed by China's current laws and regulations. Chinese 
citizens have the right to make proposals on the state system 
within the limits allowed by the Constitution. The persecution 
of the "Peace Charter" drafters in any form is to rudely trample 
upon and ruthlessly mock the laws in our country. 
  2. The purpose of the "Peace Charter" was to promote 
peaceful changes. Democratic politics and the protection of 
human rights represent the world trend. We shall never give up 
our position and ideals and shall never yield to any pressure, 
even if this means that we lose our personal freedom and lives. 
  3. We strongly demand that the authorities release Qin 
Yongmin and guarantee that they will no longer violate the legal 
rights of the citizens in any form. In view of the similar 
unfortunate experience of such democracy champions as Qi Dashan, 
Zhang Xianliang, and Fu Shenqi, we call for: The immediate 
abolition of the reeducation-through-labor system and the 
detention-for- investigation system, which go against the 
existing criminal law in our country; and for stripping the 
administrative institutions of the illegal power to deprive 
citizens of their personal freedom without trial by the judicial 
organs. 
  Yesterday, when answering reporters' inquiries, Yang Zhou 
said that the action by the authorities had aroused indignation 
among the people and he also felt that the action by the 
authorities was extremely ridiculous. He said that the "Peace 
Charter" was aimed at peace but it had been treated violently by 
the authorities and he felt that this was rather ironic. He 
added that the authorities sentenced Qin Yongmin without trial 
and this was not the sort of behavior expected of the state in a 
country exercising rule of law, thus it crushed the people's 
hopes. 
  In addition, Lo Hoi-sing, who was jailed on 
counterrevolutionary charges in the 1989 prodemocracy movement, 
said yesterday: Although the mainland authorities have made 
concessions on the human rights issue to the United States and 
indicated that they would release some prodemocracy activists, 
their basic attitude toward human rights and the prodemocracy 
movement has not changed because, when talking about the 
releases, the mainland authorities continued to arrest 
prodemocracy activists and sentence them to imprisonment. The 
action against Qin Yongmin was a good example. He held that as 
long as the "old man" who held the paramount power in the 
Chinese mainland continued to regard the prodemocracy movement 
as an unstable factor, the mainland authorities will never 
change this point of view.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu (2799 2182 2976), </F>
Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu Zhenying 
(0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a 
theoretical course attended by leading cadres of democratic 
parties, the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and 
people without party affiliation, which closed on 22 January, Li 
Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC], noted: Building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the greatest common ground of contemporary 
Chinese people, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the united 
front in the new period is the newest fruit of Marxism. He 
stressed: In studying the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to persistently 
integrate theory with practice, pay attention to investigating 
new problems, and sum up new experience. 
  The ceremony for completion of the course, presided over by 
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and president of the Central Party 
School, was held at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai this afternoon. 
During the 3-week study course, comrades have systematically 
studied Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," 
discussed it in line with reality, and heard a report on the 
current economic situation presented by Zhu Rongji, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier. 
  At the ceremony, Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the 
Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction 
Association [CDNCA], who also attended the study course, gave a 
briefing on the studies and discussions during the course. Wang 
Yiming, deputy director of the State Bureau of Technology 
Supervision; He Luli, vice chairwoman of the Central Committee 
of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and 
vice mayor of Beijing Municipality; Lu Ming, vice chairman of 
the CDNCA Central Committee and vice governor of Gansu Province; 
and Zhao Weizhi, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Jiusan Society, successively talked about what they had learned 
in the course. They summed up their rewards from participating 
in it, saying: "This study at the beginning of the year will 
drive us forward throughout the year and benefit our whole 
lives." They maintained: The political basis of the system of 
multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the CPC is the supporting and upholding of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line. As close and 
friendly parties with the CPC, the democratic parties and the 
CPC have treated each other with sincerity, and have shared weal 
and woe. Only on the basis of this greatest common ground can 
they participate in the administration and discussion of state 
affairs, and constantly push the cause of the united front 
forward. 
  Having heard the remarks of course members, Li Ruihuan said: 
The common ground is the basis of unity and unification, the 
goal of joint struggle, and the norm of standardized behavior. 
The day of the extensive formation of this common ground is the 
day when the people's cause advances triumphantly. After 
reviewing the historical process of the new democratic 
revolution and the construction of socialism, he pointed out: 
Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the 
hard-earned common ground of contemporary Chinese people. As an 
important member of the CPC's first-generation central leading 
collective and the nucleus of the second-generation central 
leading collective, Comrade Deng Xiaoping relied on his rich 
experience, extraordinary wisdom, and outstanding courage and 
resourcefulness as well as his historical position to integrate 
the basic tenets of Marxism with the newly-developed situation 
of today; to correctly sum up historical experiences; pool the 
creativeness of the people; and thus put forward the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In compliance 
with this theory, the Chinese people advanced bravely to bring 
about a tremendous change in China's appearance; to maintain 
high economic growth; markedly improve their living standards; 
increase overall national strength by the day; constantly 
promote China's international position; and steadily proceed 
with the great cause of national reunification over the past 
decade or so, despite many difficulties in their progress and 
the changeable international situation. This is obvious to all 
and universally acknowledged. The Chinese people have the 
profound personal understanding that they have benefited from 
these facts. It is an historical inevitability that building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics will become the greatest 
common ground of the Chinese people. 
  Li Ruihuan said: The united front is a unity of 
similarities and dissimilarities. The greatest and most 
important similarity among the Chinese people today is building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. This similarity is, 
namely, the common ground. Only by recognizing and adhering to 
this common ground can the united front retain its soul, and 
keep consolidating and expanding. By adhering to this common 
ground, we can "keep vigilance against right deviation" -- right 
deviation means disregarding socialism and deviating from the 
socialist course; we can also "guard against `left' deviation" 
by adhering to this common ground -- `left' deviation means 
denying Chinese characteristics, ignoring the development of the 
times, and sticking to some outdated and even seriously 
distorted concepts. Only by thoroughly grasping and correctly 
understanding the essence and gist of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics can we constantly enhance and 
scrupulously abide by the steadfastness of this common ground; 
and, on the basis of this greatest common ground, better promote 
and expand the cause of the united front, unite more people, and 
further diversify ways and methods of work, so as to make 
greater contributions to the revitalization of China and the 
reunification of the motherland. 
  He continued: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping is the concentrated exposition of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. It has comprehensively, correctly, and vividly 
addressed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's methods to recognize a series 
of important problems in the cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, his ideological viewpoints, and the 
threads of thought that form these viewpoints. The book is the 
best teaching material and a powerful weapon for positively, 
correctly, and comprehensively following through with the 
party's basic line. Mastering this book is not only the CPC's 
fundamental measure to strengthen the construction of 
ideological theory, but also an important way to launch self- 
education in the patriotic united front and enhance the common 
ground. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee was held, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has led 
the CPC to bring order out of chaos and brought about a great 
historical change. He has established the ideological line of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; corrected 
the erroneous principle of "taking class struggle as the key 
link"; accomplished the strategic shift in the CPC and state's 
work emphasis; launched the great cause of reform and opening 
up; made the decision to build a socialist market economic 
system; set the goals that reform of the political system must 
proceed in line with reform of the economic system and that a 
socialist democracy be established; stressed the need to uphold 
the party's basic line and that will not waver in it for 100 
hundred years; put forward the criterion of "conducive to three 
causes" [conducive to developing the productive forces of our 
socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our 
socialist country, and improving the people's living standards]; 
defined the form of coexistence of various forms of ownership 
with public ownership as the dominating force; expounded the 
viewpoint that science and technology constitute a primary 
productive force; affirmed that intellectuals are a part of the 
working class; created the magnificent idea of "peaceful 
reunification; one country, two systems," and others. This 
series of new ideas, theses, and summings-up are general 
political principles of vital importance to the overall 
situation, which generally sweep away the dense fog around the 
cause of China's socialist construction and point out the 
navigation route. In the meantime, all of these expositions are 
closely related to the united front; they constitute an overall 
background for the united front in the new era and produce a 
very far-reaching influence on the quality, scope, targets, 
missions, role, and methods of the united front's work. 
Conforming to the situation and needs of reform, opening up, 
and the modernization drive in the new era, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping also proposed a series of viewpoints, principles, and 
policies with the features of this era on united front work, 
adding brand-new contents to the CPC's treasure house of theory 
on the united front. For example, the viewpoint that the united 
front has developed into the most extensive league of the entire 
socialist laborers and patriots who support socialism and the 
reunification of the motherland; the viewpoint that a broad 
scope of the united front, instead of a narrow one, is 
appropriate and favorable; the viewpoint that multi- party 
cooperation under CPC leadership is a feature and advantage of 
China's political system, and that in a leading and ruling 
position in the state's political life, the CPC should all the 
more solicit and accept criticism and supervision from all 
aspects, including democratic parties; the viewpoint that the 
CPPCC is an important organization for consolidating and 
expanding China's patriotic united front as well as an important 
form of China's political system in demonstrating socialist 
democracy, and others. In short, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct views on the united 
front. He has provided supplements to inadequate areas and 
implemented things which could not be done. He has also 
corrected some mistakes and put forward a series of viewpoints 
never mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong according to the new 
situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's exposition on the united 
front work in the new period is an important component part of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
and is also a great invention of integrating the basic theory of 
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for the united front 
work with China's present actual situation. It has an extremely 
important guiding significance to our doing a good job in the 
united front work in the new period and developing and 
perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation under the 
leadership of the CPC and the political consultative system. 
  Li Ruihuan emphatically pointed out: Our study of the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is not for 
showing, but is to have a good grasp of this sharp weapon to 
solve actual problems in reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive. Only by firmly combining theory with 
practice can we increase our interest, study the theory in an 
intensive manner, and apply it permanently. 
  He said: When we stress the need to combine theory with 
practice, it does not mean we can pay no attention to studying 
books. However, we must study books in an intensive manner, 
study useful things, and study for the purpose of application. 
In studying the Marxist theory, leading cadres must first study 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works. The greatest feature of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory is that his theory is aimed at practical 
things. He never wrote an article for the purpose of writing 
something. Most of his articles are based on his research work 
and are aimed at solving conspicuous and actual problems in some 
fields during a specific period. His articles can explain the 
profound things in simple terms and can be read easily. His 
articles hold extremely profound truth with universal 
significance. However, to truly understand and grasp the 
essence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is not an easy thing. 
We must make great efforts to have a good grasp of the essence 
of his works. 
  He pointed out: Studying the new situation and summing up 
new experiences under the guidance of theory are to meet the 
need of our work, and are also very important ways to integrate 
theory with practice. At present, we are striving to establish 
a socialist market economic structure. This is a great social 
system engineering, which calls for carrying out profound 
transformation of our country's existing economic structure and 
necessary reform of certain inappropriate things in the 
superstructure. There are many problems which must be promptly 
solved in the course of transformation and reform, including 
both theoretical problems and problems in our actual work. Some 
problems can be considered as having been solved under past 
conditions, but they cannot be considered as having been solved 
in the new situation; some problems seem to have been solved 
theoretically, but they are out of line with practice; and some 
problems seem to be nonexistent in general terms, but they are 
still problems which must be solved if we study the situation in 
a deep-going manner. Therefore, we must study and sum up those 
problems in a penetrating way with the guidance of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In a certain 
sense, the course of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure is a course of study--practice--summing up experiences 
and restudy--practice again--summing up experiences again. It 
is a course of combining theory with practice to constantly 
deepen our understanding, to gradually improve our experiences, 
and to enhance our consciousness of work day by day. Meanwhile, 
it is also a course of constantly enriching and developing the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In 
the past, the CPC and various democratic parties worked with 
concerted efforts in good coordination. The theory and practice 
of the united front work have constantly been enriched and 
developed. In the future, we must inherit and carry forward 
this good tradition, create and sum up more new experiences, and 
jointly open up a new situation for the united front work.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- On the occasion of the 
second anniversary of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's inspection tour of 
southern China, more than 100 well known experts and scholars 
gathered in Shenzhen to discuss Deng Xiaoping thought on 
socialist market economy [deng xiaoping shehuizhuyi shichang 
jingji sixiang 6772 1420 1627 4357 2585 0031 5030 1579 1034 4842 
3444 1835 1927]. 
  Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central 
Committee and vice chairman of the National People's Congress 
Standing Comittee, delivered a speech at the meeting. Li 
Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and vice premier of the State Council, cabled his 
congratulations. 
  Tian Jiyun said: What is the fundamental reason that after 
15 years of reform and opening up China has made great strides 
in successfully accomplishing its first phase strategic 
objective and is presently advancing toward the goal of being 
comfortably well off? My personal experience tells me that it 
boils down to one thing, namely, the results of reform and 
opening up and delegation of authority and invigoration carried 
out since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee and carried out under the guidance of the theory of 
socialism with Chinese characteristics advanced by Comrade 
Xiaoping. Adherence to this idea is also crucial to continuing 
our triumphant advance and to realizing our second and even 
third phase strategic objectives. We must fully understand that 
the transformation to a market economy [xiang shichang jingji 
zhuanbian] is an extremely arduous process; dificulties, 
obstructions, and complications will be unavoidable. We must 
take note of and cherish the initiative of the central and local 
governments, all trades and professions, and the broad masses of 
cadres and people, which we had a hard time arousing over the 
past dozen years. He pointed out: We should follow the course 
set for us by Comrade Xiaoping, making the transformation to a 
socialist market economy, and in a down-to-earth manner, working 
steadily and making solid progress, strive to build socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  In his congratulatory telegram, Li Lanqing, member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier 
of the State Council, said: I hope that this conference will 
contribute to deepening the study and understanding of Comrade 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and to further carrying out the decision of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
that it will play a positive role in deepening reform and 
promoting development. 
  This conference was jointly sponsored and convened by the 
China Market Economy Association, the Guangdong Provincial 
Federation of Societies for Social Sciences, and the Shenzhen 
Municipal CPC Committee. Wang Jue, chairman of the China Market 
Economy Association, presided over the conference. The experts 
and scholars in attendance held lively discussions on thoroughly 
understanding and earnestly carrying out Comrade Xiaoping's 
thought on socialist market economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national conference 
of heads of organization departments -- which ended today -- 
pointed out that, in 1994, organization affairs must keep pace 
with the new situation; and organization leaders at all levels 
must continue to emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, 
strive to improve their skills in leading socialist market 
economy and their ability to resolve their own problems, build 
stronger grass-roots party organizations, and intensify efforts 
for educating and managing party members so the endeavors of 
deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, expediting 
development, and maintaining stability can be ensured 
organizationally. 
  Addressing the meeting, Zhang Quanjing, executive deputy 
head 
of the CPC Central Committee Organization Department, stressed 
the need to earnestly accomplish the assignment put forth by the 
14th national party congress to arm all party members with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. He said: County-level and higher 
ranking leaders must be more aware of the need to study the 
theory and properly handle the relationship between their work 
and study, and between leading economic construction and leading 
ideological construction. They must set aside more time for 
study, take part in fewer parties [shao yi dian ying chou 1421 
0001 7820 2019 6804], and make greater efforts to improve their 
theoretical proficiency. Currently we should combine the study 
of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
with the study of the decision of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, and consider whether we can 
actively implement the central authorities' measures for reform, 
and properly handle the relationship among reform, development, 
and stability as an important criterion for examining whether or 
not our study is successful. 
  Zhang Quanjing pointed out: We must build stronger leading 
bodies, focusing on their political awareness and conduct. 
Members of leading bodies at all levels must continue to 
heighten their awareness of enforcing democratic centralism, and 
they must properly handle the relationships between partial and 
overall, local and central, and immediate and long-range 
interests. They must strictly enforce orders and prohibitions, 
firmly safeguard the Central Committee's authority, and make 
sure that all its decisions and measures for reform are 
successfully carried out. While heightening their political 
awareness and improving their conduct, leading bodies must also 
fight corruption and perform their duties more ethically and 
diligently. To guard against irregularities in selecting and 
using personnel, we must uphold the principle that our cadres 
must be more revolutionary, better educated, younger in average 
age, and professionally more competent; and that our cadres must 
have both political integrity and capability. 
  Zhang Quanjing said: We must strive to do a good job in 
training, educating, and selecting middle-age and young cadres. 
We must do a good job in bringing up and selecting cadres to 
become top leaders of party and government departments. Party 
committees and organization departments at all levels must pay 
attention to finding candidates with good qualities, and 
especially great potential for growth; train them hard, and 
create for them the conditions with which they can mature after 
being tempered in all respects. We must truly emancipate our 
minds, change our mindsets, and select people -- especially 
young people -- who are commonly acknowledged to have performed 
remarkably in upholding the line of reform and opening up, and 
people who are able to lead socialist market economy. To create 
the mentality and institution favorable for young talents to 
come to the fore, we must break the bondage of outmoded 
conventional ideas, especially ideas that emphasize seniority, 
and ideas that people to be used must be perfect in every way. 
  Speaking on building stronger grass-roots party 
organizations, Zhang Quanjing said: As for party organizations 
in state-owned enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises, our 
main responsibility is to make sure they are properly 
established, to supervise and inspect their operations, and to 
sum up and popularize typical experiences. As for grass-roots 
party organizations in rural areas, priority should be given to 
tightening up the regressive party branches. We should study 
how to build stronger party organizations while establishing a 
modern enterprise system; intensify the study of establishing 
party organizations in township and town enterprises; and 
actively study how to establish party organizations in 
enterprise groups, incorporated enterprises, and private 
enterprises, and how these organizations can play their parts 
effectively. 
  Zhang Quanjing noted that great efforts must be made in 
reforming the personnel system governing the use of cadres. He 
said: Currently and in the time to come, the personnel system 
will be restructured comprehensively, instead of achieving 
breakthroughs in some particular respects. The basic assignment 
is that, under the premise that cadres are placed under the 
management of the party, we will gradually establish a 
scientific system of managing cadres -- a system under which 
cadres are graded and categorized, qualified personnel are used 
through open and equal competition, cadres' performance will be 
scientifically evaluated, awards and penalties will be given 
justly, cadres will be encouraged to move up or move down, human 
resources will be allocated rationally, the flow of cadres will 
proceed in an orderly manner, cadres are subjected to 
supervision and restraint, and cadres will be given all kinds of 
training at various levels and through various channels. Zhang 
Quanjing stressed: This year, organization departments should 
make new strides in taking active part in guiding the 
implementation of the state's civil service system, in 
expediting the process of managing cadres according to their 
different specializations, in making the management of cadres 
even more democratic, in promoting exchange among cadres, and in 
intensifying the supervision over cadres. 
  Lu Feng, head of the CPC Central Committee Organization 
Department, chaired the conference. He also addressed the 
meeting before it closed. Present at the meeting were heads of 
organization departments under party committees of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the Central Government's jurisdiction; heads of organization 
departments under the party committees of municipalities 
authorized to have independent economic planning, and party 
committees of some provincial seats; heads of organization 
departments of work committees for organs under the Central 
Committee and work committees for central government organs; and 
persons in charge of the cadres' affairs department and the 
organization department of the General Political Department of 
the People's Liberation Army and the Political Department of the 
National Armed Police Corps.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Tang Hua (3282 5478): "Song Defu (1345 </F>
1795 4395) Speaks About New Thoughts on Reform of State 
Personnel Work"] 
  [Text] Can the public service system be brought onto track 
and put into operation? What major reform movements are there 
in the personnel system of enterprises and public undertakings? 
When will the reform plan of the new wage system be put into 
effect? How will reform of the social insurance system for 
government organizations and public undertakings get started? 
Can the flow of human resources be "released, but in good 
order, and be full of vigor, but not chaotic"? How will 
government personnel management move toward legalization?.... 
  At the meeting of personnel department and bureau directors 
held before the end of last year, Personnel Minister Song Defu 
gave a LIAOWANG staff reporter a special interview on the above 
issues of social concern. 
  Song Defu unfolded his talk on building a personnel 
management system complementary to the system of a socialist 
market economy; that is, a classified management personnel 
system, a scientific and rational wage distribution system, a 
multilevel social insurance system and macroeconomic personnel 
management system, a human resources market system, and a 
personnel rules and regulation system, which are new thoughts on 
reform of state personnel work. 
<H3>  I. 1994: To Create A Good Beginning for Carrying Out the 
State Public Service System </H3>
  Song Defu spoke about carrying out -- from making 
experiments 
to gradually spreading out -- the state public service system 
against the particular background of government organizational 
reform and personnel reduction. He did not conceal that 
corresponding complementary regulations were still lacking, and 
that the rate of progress varied. Moreover, the efforts made on 
publicity were inadequate, which led to insufficient social 
understanding. For example, some people equated carrying out 
the public service system with wage reform. 
  To ensure bringing the public service system onto track and 
putting it into operation, it is necessary to carry forward in 
an overall manner and stress the main points in implementation 
in 1994. Song Defu spoke about putting forward the following 
different requirements according to the deployment by the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council: 
  On the basis of organizational reform, various departments 
of 
the State Council and most of the provincial level departments 
and the municipal departments whose plans are listed separately, 
have initially built up the state public service system, and 
have completed the transition from existing personnel to public 
servants. Moreover, some county and city governments have 
acquired experimental experiences in building the public service 
system. 
  Organizations that have not carried out organizational 
reform, except positions set-up and nonleading posts arrangement 
and other work, are required to implement the "Provisions 
Regarding the State Public Servants" by merging with the 
practical situation of personnel work, so as to lay a good 
foundation for building the public service system. 
  Whether or not organizational reform has been carried out, a 
mechanism of openness, equality, and encouragement of 
competition should be built up gradually, and open examination 
and strict check- ups should be carried out to select the best 
for employing nonleading personnel below the position of section 
chief. 
  The public service system being of immediate concern to the 
broad masses of government personnel, Song Defu emphasized: "It 
is necessary to do good work and take organization and 
implementation seriously. How can we determine in advance the 
scope of implementation? The implementation of the new wage 
system appears to be most pressing. This involves whether an 
organization is following the wage system of government 
organizations or that of public undertakings. It is necessary 
to take the functions of an organization as the basis, and 
uphold separating the functions of government and enterprises, 
and separating those of government and public undertakings. Due 
to reasons of set-up and establishment, if it is difficult to 
determine for the time being the nature of an organization, it 
may be temporarily excluded from the scope of carrying out the 
public service system." 
  Song Defu raised the point that in organizational reform, 
personnel diversion should be combined with restructuring 
government personnel, and that a rational proportion of various 
levels of personnel should be maintained. If those diverted are 
ordinary working staff or young personnel, and those who should 
stay are leading members or elderly, then it would be very 
difficult for the public service structure to be rational. 
  The job of improving the rules and regulations of the state 
public service system is being done intensely. Song Defu 
declared: "We will strive to promulgate as soon as possible 
`Methods for Implementation of the Classification of Posts for 
State Public Servants', `Temporary Regulations on the Employment 
of State Public Servants', `Temporary Regulations on the 
Assessment of State Public Servants', and grasp firmly the work 
of investigation and study and drafting of temporary regulations 
for awards, training, promotion and demolition, appointment and 
dismissal, and retirement." 
<H3>  II. Public Undertakings: "Separation, Classification, 
Decentralization of Power, and Reinvigoration" Enterprises: 
Gradually Build Up the Personnel System of Modern Enterprises </H3>
  Speaking about the reform of the personnel system of public 
undertakings, which are varied and complicated, Song Defu 
clearly pointed out: "Public undertakings, as relatively 
independent entities with corporate qualifications, require 
corresponding personnel decisionmaking power. At present, major 
reform moves of the personnel system of public undertakings 
include:" 
  "Further reform the system of appointment and selection, 
adopt multiple forms for selecting and appointing administrative 
leading personnel of public undertakings, and experiments can be 
made in organizations with conditions for selecting leading 
members by public bidding." 
  "The clerk system will be gradually carried out for 
managerial staff and a specialized technological post 
appointment system will be gradually carried out for specialized 
technological personnel." 
  To reduce the state's financial burdens, it is necessary to 
reduce the number of public undertakings and people that eat 
"the emperor's grain." For public undertakings that get 
appropriations, it is necessary to introduce the mechanism of 
competition, encouragement, and risks, and to transition to 
revenue and expenditure by themselves. For public undertakings 
that are fully responsible for expenses by themselves, it is 
necessary to encourage them to carry out enterprise management, 
and make experiments on linking work with efficiency. 
  For personnel of public undertakings that get full 
appropriations, such as those engaged in basic theoretical 
research, high-tech research, and secondary and primary schools, 
experiments should be made to be responsible for gross wages 
until the task is completed; that is, for over-strength, there 
will be no increase in gross wages, and for vacancies, there 
will be no decrease, so as to make the contingent capable and 
highly efficient. It is necessary to create an environment 
which enables outstanding talents to show themselves, and to 
train and bring up a contingent of academic and technological 
leaders that meet the needs of China's modernization program and 
are capable of entering the world's scientific and technological 
forward position. 
  The pace of reform of the enterprise personnel system is 
being quickened to meet the requirements for building the system 
of modern enterprises. Song Defu spoke about carrying out the 
post appointment system for enterprises' managerial staff and 
specialized technological personnel. Enterprises enjoy the 
power of personnel management according to law, specialized 
technological personnel and managerial staff enjoy the right to 
choose their occupations according to law, and the rights and 
obligations relations of both parties are established by 
employment contract. Government personnel departments should 
protect the legitimate rights and interests of both parties. 
  Moreover, it is also necessary to study how to abolish 
gradually the bounds between cadres and workers within 
enterprises, between cadres of different ownership, and between 
different types (fixed, employed) of cadres, so as to build up a 
personnel mechanism that enables cadres to be able to work at 
higher as well as lower levels and to enter and leave government 
organizations, and a mechanism that facilitates two-way 
selection and rational flow, and to train and bring up a 
contingent of high-quality and occupational entrepreneurs. 
  Song Defu indicated that we should lose no time in solving 
the problem of separating the state-owned enterprise grades from 
administrative grades according to the principle of separating 
the functions of government and enterprises. In the future, no 
administrative grades will be fixed for newly built enterprises 
without exception, and the arrangement of their management 
personnel will be rationally determined according to the 
situation of the enterprises and their personnel conditions. 
Enterprises that originally had administrative grades should be 
separated from administrative grades, and no longer apply 
mechanically the administrative grades of the party and 
government organizations. Grades and treatments for various 
types of enterprise personnel should no longer be fixed in the 
light of the administrative grades of the party and government 
organizations. We are now making the best use of time to work 
out relevant methods for implementation and complementary 
management methods on listening to reports, reading documents, 
and taking part in meetings. 
  Song Defu recommended: "To coordinate with the building of a 
modern enterprises system, it is necessary to study working out 
the 'Provisions Regarding the Personnel Management of 
State-Owned Enterprises' and 'Temporary Methods for the 
Personnel Management of Joint Stock System Enterprises'." 
<H3>  III. The New Wage System: Onto the Track and in Normal 
Operation As Soon As Possible </H3>
  After the reform plans and the three implementation methods 
of the new wage system of state organs and public undertakings 
have been transmitted to the lower levels, various localities 
and departments are paying close attention to working out 
specific suggestions for implementation. Song Defu said: "To 
my knowledge, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council attach great importance to and are much 
concerned about the current wage reform. In the present wage 
system reform, the state has made great efforts for wage 
increases under difficult financial situations. It has brought 
the new wage system onto track and put it into operation by 
taking into consideration the interest relations of various 
aspects as best she can, and made gradual improvements. The 
starting point of the current wage system reform is to build up 
a corresponding wage system and a normal wage increase mechanism 
according to the respective characteristics of government 
organizations and public undertakings. The wages of public 
servants are determined and readjusted by the state according to 
the economic growth situation and referring to the average wage 
level of enterprises, and a normal mechanism for promotion and 
wages increase will be built up on that basis. Different 
management methods, wage system, and methods of distribution 
will be carried out for public undertakings according to the 
difference in the source of appropriations and the 
characteristics of trades. 
  How do we bring the wage system onto track and put it into 
operation? Song Defu reiterated that personnel departments at 
various levels should, according to the unified deployment by 
the central authorities, "Be active and safe, be strict and 
tight, and control total amounts." No locality or department 
will go their own way and muddle things up. Various localities 
and departments should strengthen ideological, political work, 
and do good turns meticulously to help the broad masses of the 
personnel of government organizations and public undertakings 
understand that the current wages reform is mainly to build up a 
new wage system, and to bring it onto track and put it into 
operation, so as to lay a good foundation for the future. We 
should understand that the state is very much concerned about 
the life of the staff and workers under difficult financial 
situation, and it is no easy job to take out so much money. We 
should understand that the problems accumulated in wage 
distribution are many, that it is impossible to have all of them 
overcome by the present one reform, and that it requires a 
process for gradual improvement. 
<H3>  IV. Social Insurance System of Government Organizations and 
Public Undertakings: The Easy Ones Come First and the Difficult 
Ones Later, Getting in Position Gradually </H3>
  Speaking about the present delay in reform of the social 
insurance system of government organizations and public 
undertakings, Song Defu declared: "The job of reform is very 
difficult. Some localities and departments have not started 
yet, and those places that have built up the insurance system 
are confronted with many difficulties. The progress of reform 
of the social insurance system of government organizations and 
public undertakings is slow, and has become the "bottleneck" 
constraining reform of the personnel system." 
  In carrying out the old-age and unemployment insurance 
system 
by overall social planning, Song Defu said: "Adhering to the 
principle of easy ones first and difficult ones later, first 
build up the old- age and unemployment insurance system for 
contract-based workers of government organizations and public 
undertakings, and build up the old-age funds overall planning 
system. As for public undertakings, first start with those that 
are responsible for revenue and expenditure by themselves, and 
on the basis that the state continues to bear the expenses for 
personnel who have retired, explore the methods under which 
individuals are required to pay a part of the old-age pension to 
build up a part of the funds accumulation. It is necessary to 
study jointly with the financial departments about building a 
social insurance system of government organizations, especially 
that of state public servants." He stressed that the general 
principle for the raising and using of funds should be: "The 
rights, obligations, and compulsion are combined, and the state, 
organizations, and individuals share burdens. The 
administrative management of social insurance should be 
separated from the funds operation of social insurance." 
  The current reform of the social insurance system of 
government organizations and public undertakings adopts the 
policy of "making experiments actively, easy ones come first and 
difficult ones later, and get in position gradually." Song Defu 
pointed out clearly: "On the basis of the general principle of 
reform, it is allowed to take different methods for experiments, 
and a certain difference is allowed among various localities. A 
number of different types of organizations should be selected 
for experiments in a planned way. In addition, make the best use 
of time to study and work out regulations on old-age insurance. 
<H3>  V. The Human Resources Market: Rational Flow, Rational 
Disposition, and Rational Use of Various Types of Personnel Are 
Allowed As Much As Possible </H3>
  Against the background of increases in the demand for human 
resources, the contradiction between shortage and idle human 
resources has become increasingly acute. Talking about the 
thoughts on building and improving the human resources market 
system, Song Defu put forward "five changes": Change from human 
resources lying idle and shortages to market flow, making up the 
other's deficiency from one's own surplus, and rational 
disposition; change from organization and department ownership 
of human resources to social ownership, rational flow, and 
helping supply each other's needs; change from one-way selection 
to two-way selection of human resources flow; change from "fair 
market" to "location market" of human resources flow; change 
from the human resources disposition model of "overall 
assignment and disposition" to the model of bringing into play 
the basic role of human resources market in human resources 
disposition under the state macroeconomic management. 
  Song Defu said that we should use human resources flow in 
handling circulation. To provide an opportunity for two-way 
selection we should minimize intermediate links as best we can. 
Pay close attention to working out and improving relevant 
policies and rules and regulations on the human resources 
market, make the best use of time in 1994 to transmit to lower 
levels the "Opinions on Speeding Up the Training and Development 
of Human Resources Market," and promulgate the "Temporary 
Regulations on Arbitration of Disputes Arising From Human 
Resources Flow." Protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
the employers' organizations and individuals so as to enable the 
human resources market to operate in an orderly manner within 
the scope of law. On the basis of human resources flow under 
existing personnel departments, gradually build up a regular 
human resources market and a nationwide human resources supply 
and demand information network to provide more timely, speedy, 
and richer information for organizations to select personnel and 
for individuals to choose their occupations. 
  In policy guidance of human resources flow, Song Defu 
emphasized guidance and preferential measures toward the needs 
of the state's key projects and outlying and difficult districts 
where conditions are hard. It is necessary to take feasible 
measures to encourage human resources to stay in outlying and 
difficult districts, and the state should render appropriate 
support and protection in policy. It is necessary to explore 
through concerted efforts a new way of encouraging human 
resources to stay in outlying and difficult districts and of 
importing them. And it is also necessary to strengthen 
management and supervision over the human resources market. 
  Song Defu finally stressed: "All of the five major links for 
building the basic framework of the system of a socialist market 
economy put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Congress are directly related to personnel work. For example, 
to build up a modern enterprises system, we are held responsible 
for the reform of the enterprise personnel system. To build up 
a unified and open market system, we are held responsible for 
training, building, and improving the human resources market. 
In transforming government functions, we have to study 
organizational reform jointly with departments concerned, and 
have the task of transforming functions. In wage distribution, 
we undertake the task of reforming the wage system of government 
organizations and public undertakings. To build up a social 
insurance system, we are held responsible for the job of 
building up a social insurance system of government 
organizations and public undertakings. Personnel departments at 
various levels should enhance their sense of responsibility and 
continue studying the new situation with thoughts on reform, and 
solving new problems by the methods of reform.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- A thorough report 
on crime in China during the present period, one of the 
country's key national research projects in science and 
technology, has just been completed. 
  This was learned today from the Ministry of Public Security. 
  The 5-million-word research report offers "systematic and 
thorough analysis and discussions" on the overall situation, 
causes and trends of current crime in China, and introduces new 
tactics to curb them, said a ministry spokesman. 
  A committee consisting of a dozen political and legal 
experts 
in the country and 20 provincial representatives met in Beijing 
today to assess this research result. 
  The spokesman said that more than 1,000 experts conducted 
investigations in 20 provinces for three years, with some 10,000 
criminal cases and 300 police sub-stations surveyed. 
  Through this research, according to the spokesman, China has 
established a computer system to collect, process, store and 
consult on criminal information. 
  Some special research institutions and other academic bodies 
on crime have also been set up. 
  "This research is of great value for fighting against crime 
and promoting China's criminology theories," said Vice-Minister 
Bai Jingfu at the symposium. 
  A large number of personnel have been trained in this 
research, and some have become experts in research, education 
and public security work.

  [Text] Cynthia Khan writes us from east Africa. She is 
working with the British medical team in east Africa and wants 
to know about the AIDS situation in China and how the Chinese 
Government is dealing with the problem. 
  Well, Cynthia, AIDS has become a global problem. Since the 
first case was found in the United States in 1981, the disease 
has quickly spread throughout the world, killing hundreds of 
thousands of people, and China is not immune to the spread of 
AIDS. 
  The first HIV-infection case in China was reported in 1985 
in 
the country's eastern province of Zhejiang. Four children who 
had hemophilia contracted the HIV virus because of contaminated 
blood used in transfusions. The blood plasma was imported from 
abroad. The Chinese Government banned the import of plasma 
immediately after that case. Additional HIV infections were 
found among intravenous drug users in the southern border 
province of Yunnan in 1989. Since then, China has identified 
more than 1,150 cases of HIV carriers, and 19 people have become 
afflicted with full-blown AIDS. At present, 85 percent of those 
infected with the AIDS virus in China are intravenous drug 
users. The border area with Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia is the 
most infected area because of its long history of opium trade 
and drug abuse. This area is still backward economically and 
far from urban areas. Transportation is limited. Radio and 
television sets, which can be used to warn people about the 
dangers of contracting AIDS, are rare, and medical service is 
not always available. In addition, cultural habits are 
responsible for some of the infections, as the local Dai and 
Jingpo ethnic groups believe opium is a cure for headache and 
diarrhea. 
  Planting and processing opium is banned by the government, 
but it is difficult for the small police force in the area to 
eliminate the illegal practice when the villagers plant opium in 
very small fields in the dense forests. Another problem is the 
shortage of needles, forcing many of the drug users to share 
needles. This causes the disease to spread even faster. 
  The Chinese Government has set up a clinic in Yunnan to 
monitor AIDS cases and educate the public about the dangers. 
But getting the information out is very difficult. Zhu Wei is 
working as a researcher with the AIDS surveillance center under 
the China Academy of Preventive Medicine. He has worked with 
the local teams in Yunnan Province. 
  [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in 
Mandarin, fading into English translation] The local people 
know little about disease that is threatening their lives. When 
talking with them, we need interpreters in Dai and Jingpo 
languages, because these people do not speak Mandarin, and most 
of them do not know how to read and write. The only thing they 
care about seems to be drugs. Every year the AIDS surveillance 
center sends a number of researchers to Yunnan to help with the 
local work and get firsthand information. I went to Yunnan last 
year. A lot of local medical workers who know the languages and 
have knowledge of AIDS went to every family with us, explaining 
the fatal disease to them. We put up a poster warning about the 
danger of AIDS in the villages. We paid special attention to 
the families that already had AIDS patients or HIV carriers. We 
talked to the family members on how to protect themselves from 
being affected. And now and then, the local medical workers 
visit these families to see how things go on. [end recording] 
  Though drug users make up the majority of AIDS victims in 
China, they are not the most dangerous factors of the spreading 
of AIDS in the country. Medical experts say the most dangerous 
factor is promiscuous sexual activity. For more than three 
decades after the founding of the PRC, Chinese successfully 
protected themselves against venereal diseases. However, while 
the opening and reform programs that began in the 1980's have 
brought prosperity to the country, they have also caused 
dramatic changes in people's ideas about morality and sex. 
Cases of prostitution are increasingly rapidly every year. The 
number of people who have sexual partners outside marriage is 
increasing, and sexual activity among young people and teenagers 
is now occurring much earlier. The number of venereal disease 
cases has increased dramatically. In 1991, sexually 
transmission accounted for 10 percent of the total number of HIV 
cases. In 1992 it was 20 percent. The rate is still growing. 
  Another high risk group is homosexuals. The first five 
victims in the world were all homosexuals, and in California, 
United States, 90 percent of HIV infections are found in gays. 
Even though right now only a small fraction of Chinese 
homosexuals are confirmed HIV carriers, medical carriers warn 
they are a prime target for the disease [as heard]. Influenced 
by Chinese traditions, most of these people have a normal 
family, but have unsafe sexual practices outside their family 
secretly. They, therefore, risk spreading the disease to their 
family who may not know there is a homosexual in their family. 
  The AIDS problem has caught the attention of the Chinese 
Government. In March 1993, the Ministry of Public Health held a 
conference on AIDS protection and cure in the city of Haikou in 
the southern island province of Hainan. The conference dealt 
with AIDS surveillance, management of HIV carriers, HIV 
test-kits, as well as public education on sexually transmitted 
diseases and AIDS. It was decided at the conference that all 
donated blood will be screened in the future, and more 
physicians will be trained in the clinical diagnosis of HIV 
infections. The conference also called on all medical personnel 
to do more research on AIDS treatment and on developing testing 
methods which are both effective and inexpensive. Qian Chunqiao, 
an expert on the disease, is also working with AIDS surveillance. 
  [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in 
Mandarin, fading into English translation] The government has 
allocated quite a number of funds for AIDS prevention and 
research, but as far as AIDS medicines are concerned, China lags 
far behind such developed countries as the United States and 
some European countries. For one thing, we do not have as many 
funds and specialized medical researchers. Another thing is 
that AIDS has a relatively shorter history in China, and we lack 
experience. In recent years, some Chinese researchers have been 
trying to combine traditional Chinese medicines, such as herbal 
medicine and acupuncture, with Western methods in treating the 
disease. It is difficult to say what results may come up from 
this research because AIDS is a very complicated disease, and we 
still do not know many things about this disease. But I do not 
believe AIDS is incurable. Sooner or later, humanity will find a 
way to cure themselves of the disease. [end recording] 
  On 1 December last year, the world's AIDS Day, the Ministry 
of Public Health held a symposium in Beijing. Experts suggested 
that work in 1994 should be focused on education, making people 
aware of the importance of self-protection. The symposium also 
announced the establishment of China's first special 
organization to cope with sexually transmitted diseases and 
AIDS. The China Association of Sexually Transmitted Diseases 
and AIDS Control and Prevention concentrated on AIDS and 
sexually transmitted diseases prevention and cure as well as 
information exchange.

<F P=106> ["The Fifth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fourth </F>
Regional Party Committee Is Successfully Concluded"] 
  [Text] The five-day Fifth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of 
the Fourth Tibetan Autonomous Regional CPC Committee 
successfully concluded in Lhasa on the afternoon of 17 December 
after discussing all items on the agenda. 
  Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional 
party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, delivered 
a speech in which he summed up the meeting by stressing major 
tasks for the region this winter and next spring. His speech 
covers four aspects: first, the main results of the meeting; 
second, problems concerning how to convey and carry out the 
guiding spirit of the meeting; third, major tasks to be carried 
out this winter and next spring; and fourth, problems concerning 
how to improve the work style and strengthen the campaign of 
building a clean government. 
  Attending the meeting were leaders of the autonomous 
regional 
party committee including Raidi, Guo Jinlong, Danzim, Yang 
Chuantang, Buqiong, and Li Guangwen, Political Commissar Hu 
Yongzhu of the Tibet Military District, leading cadres of 
provincial-level party members, standing members of the regional 
commission for discipline inspection, and all the comrades who 
attended the fifth plenary (enlarged) session of the fourth 
regional party committee. 
  Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous regional 
party committee Standing Committee, presided over the meeting. 
  The meeting conveyed the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the meeting of the 
CPC Central Committee on rural work, and the national meeting on 
the work of united fronts. It examined a report by the CPC 
Advisory Group of the Tibet Autonomous Region and adopted a 
resolution that such a group will no longer be established. 
Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous regional 
party committee Standing Committee, offered a report entitled 
"Conscientiously Study and Comprehensively Carry Out the Guiding 
Spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and Work Hard To Establish a Socialist Market Economic 
System." 
  The meeting concentrated on great events and political 
affairs. It was a meeting for unifying thinking, enhancing 
understanding, sizing up the situation, fostering faith, and 
strengthening the sense of urgency in seizing opportunities in 
order to lay a solid ideological foundation for accelerating the 
pace of reform, opening up, and economic development. It was 
also for emancipating the mind, invigorating the spirit, and 
promoting unity and progress. 
  Talking about the major results of this meeting during his 
speech, Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: The greatest 
result of this meeting is that we have enhanced understanding, 
unified thinking, reached a consensus, fostered faith, and 
strengthened the sense of urgency in building a socialist market 
economic system. Major expressions of the meeting can be found 
in further deepening the understanding of the necessity to build 
a socialist market economic system, in defining the basic 
principle of accelerating the pace of reform and opening up as 
well as establishing a socialist market economic system in our 
region, in finding out the gap, and in strengthening the sense 
of responsibility and urgency in accelerating the reform and 
promoting the economic development. Major expressions of the 
meeting can also be found in further understanding the 
importance of the role of farming and animal husbandry as the 
foundation of the national economy, in paying attention to two 
important things [economic development and stable situation] 
simultaneously, and in strengthening and improving party 
leadership. 
  Comrade Gyaincain Norbu added: During the discussion, all of 
us have profoundly felt that the largest obstacle in 
establishing a socialist market economic system lies in ideology 
and in understanding problems. Our comrades said that in 
changing the economic system, it is necessary to first change 
our thinking. Only by following the standards of the "three 
conducive causes" ["conducive to developing the productive 
forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength 
of our socialist country, and improving the people's living 
standards"], by being bold in our endeavors and experiments, and 
by working hard under the new system, can we realize the goal of 
achieving new results in our economic and social development. 
We all believed we can achieve social stability and national 
prosperity based on strong material foundation only by seizing 
opportunities and unswervingly carrying out the drive of reform, 
opening up, and modernization. He continued: All comrades 
believed the greatest gap between the region and the hinterland 
and coastal areas lies in emancipating the mind; in having a 
sense of urgency; in carrying out the tasks; in over-emphasizing 
the special conditions in Tibet; and in our tendency to "wait, 
depend on, and ask for" subsidies from central authorities. If 
we do not change this situation, we will bring about even 
greater passive and graver consequences. As leading cadres of 
the party, we have great responsibility during the course of 
establishing a new system. We should take the lead in our 
march, seize opportunities, and organize and lead the people in 
our great drive of reform and opening up. 
  Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: During the course of 
building a socialist market economic system, it is imperative to 
attach great importance to the role of farming and animal 
husbandry as the foundation of the national economy, follow the 
guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and the Meeting of the CPC Central Committee 
on rural work, continue to maintain the party's basic policy in 
agricultural and pastoral areas, unswervingly deepen the reform 
of the economic system in rural areas, and promote rapid and 
sound economic development in agricultural and pastoral areas. 
We should firmly foster the ideology of paying equal attention 
to two important things, that is, economic development and 
stable situation, actively launch the campaign of 
anti-splittism, and create favorable a social environment for 
establishing a socialist market economic system and accelerating 
the pace of reform and economic development in our region. 
  While talking about how to convey the guiding spirit of this 
meeting, Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said: The Fifth Plenary 
(Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Autonomous Regional CPC 
Committee is an important meeting, representing the fact that 
our region has entered a critical stage in carrying out reform 
of the economic system. Therefore, it is extremely important to 
do a good job in conveying the guiding spirit of the meeting. 
The general requirement for this work is to conscientiously 
study the documents, formulate concrete measures, and guarantee 
comprehensive implementation. The major goals of our work lie 
in profoundly understanding the great significance of the 
"decision" [decision of the CPC Central Committee on some issues 
concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure] and its essence, in correctly appreciating the 
necessity of establishing a socialist market economic system in 
our region, in comprehensively understanding the thread of 
thought, major principle, and main tasks of the reform of the 
economic system in our region, and in sizing up the situation, 
seizing the opportunities to accelerate the reform and economic 
development. He also urged leaders at all levels to study and 
formulate a plan for accelerating the drive of reform and 
opening by taking into consideration actual conditions of their 
localities and departments. He said that it is necessary to 
attach importance to making gradual progress in reform and to 
losing no opportunities in achieving breakthroughs in important 
links so as to spur the whole situation of reform. 
  Concerning some major tasks to be performed in this winter 
and next spring, Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: It is a 
completely new undertaking to build a socialist market economic 
system. We need a great theory as our guidance. Great efforts 
should be made to systematically study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the "decision." At present, it is particularly important to 
study well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. He stressed: The economic work of our region 
this winter, next spring, and next year should be carried out in 
accordance with the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the National Meeting on 
Economic Work. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the 
role of farming and animal husbandry as the foundation of 
national economy, concentrate on increasing the incomes of 
people living in agricultural and pastoral areas, strengthen the 
leadership over the work in agricultural and pastoral areas, 
exert great efforts in developing village and town enterprises, 
increase input in farming and animal husbandry, attach 
importance to the fundamental construction of water conservancy 
projects in farmland and grassland, pay attention to 
disaster-prevention and disaster-relief, and make a good 
arrangement for the requirements of people's livelihood so as to 
lay a foundation for reaping a good harvest in farming and 
animal husbandry next year. Various enterprises at all levels 
should concentrate on enhancing economic results, improving 
management, tightening disciplines so as to accomplish this 
year's production quotas and lay a good foundation for the 
management of next year's production. Comrade Gyaincain Norbu 
said: In carrying out the reform of the economic system in our 
region, it is necessary to insist on the standard of productive 
force, seize the opportunities, exert an all-out effort, and 
make breakthroughs in some key points. We should maintain steps 
in unison with other parts of the country in improving our 
system. We should proceed from Tibet's realities and make active 
and stable efforts in our work. Greater efforts should be made 
to accelerate the pace of reform in nine aspects, including 
state-owned enterprises, finance and taxation, banking industry, 
price, economic relations and trade, circulation, housing 
system, social protection, as well as work in farming and 
pastoral areas. 
  Comrade Cyaincain Norbu pointed out: Reform, development, 
and social stability are interactive and mutually supplementary. 
In order to guarantee the smooth implementation of reform next 
year, it is imperative to pay attention to the following points: 
Prevent splittist elements at home and abroad from instigating 
riots among people by making use of reform and price reform in 
particular; it is necessary to take into consideration the 
state's guiding spirit of reform, conduct thorough investigation 
and analysis of the realities in our region, and extensively 
seek opinions of all circles while formulating a plan for 
reform; and, before introducing a reform policy, try to do a 
good job in propaganda work among people so as to make them 
understand, support, and participate in such reform. During his 
speech, Comrade Cyaincain Norbu also said: In carrying out the 
tough work of anti-corruption, it is necessary to resolutely 
implement the directives of the CPC Central Committee and the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection concerning opposing 
corruption and rectifying the work style of the party, 
strengthen the clean-government drive, and ensure to achieve the 
current-stage results of anti-corruption. 
  In conclusion, Comrade Cyaincain Norbu said: The upcoming 
year of 1994 is extremely important for our region to carry out 
the socialist modernization drive. Party organizations at all 
levels should work with best spirit and lead people of all 
nationalities in the region in establishing a socialist market 
economic system and accomplishing other tasks. 
  The meeting was concluded with the majestic music of the 
"Internationale" at 11:30 in the morning.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Informed sources today [23 January] confirmed a 
report in the U.S. NATIONAL DEFENSE NEWS WEEKLY concerning 
Taiwan's arms procurement. According to the report, Taiwan, 
bowing to the Legislative Yuan's demand for low-priced high 
technology and expanded participation of domestic industrial 
sectors, has decided to temporarily postpone the purchase of 
M-60 tanks and other weapons from the United States. 
  Taiwan is no longer an enthusiastic patron who would 
unconditionally buy all U.S.-made weapons on the list, and this 
is the first time in several decades that Taiwan has postponed 
the purchase of arms already approved by Washington for export, 
reported the weekly. 
  The weekly's report says: At a secret meeting between the 
two sides at the Pentagon 5 January, officials from Taiwan's 
Defense Ministry disclosed that they must temporarily postpone 
the purchase of M-60 tanks and about two squadrons of T-38 
trainer aircraft. In addition, due to domestic pressure, the 
Defense Ministry may temporarily postpone the purchase of at 
least two major equipment systems already approved by Washington 
for sale to Taiwan. Included in the purchase is an improved 
antiaircraft system valued at about $1 billion. According to 
the officials, Taiwan has postponed the purchase of arms because 
of the increasingly tight defense budget and growing pressure 
from the Legislative Yuan which is demanding that it examine 
each and every major arms purchase project.

  [Text] Budapest, Jan. 26 (CNA) -- The Vice President of 
Hungary's Christian Democratic People's Party (CDPP) has called 
for expanded relations between Hungary and Taiwan. 
  "We insist on the earliest possible opening of the Hungarian 
trade and cultural office in Taipei," CDPP Vice President and 
Member of Parliament mIKLOS hASZNOS said after returning from a 
weeklong visit to Taiwan. 
  Hasznos and Bela Csepe, leader of the parliamentary faction 
of the CDPP recently traveled to Taipei to boost bilateral ties 
between Budapest and Taipei. 
  Hasznos told CNA Budapest that they wanted to discuss how to 
speed up the opening of the office with Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Geza Jeszenszky. He said it was in Hungary's best 
interests to have the office open sometime this year. 
  Hasznos pointed out that development of economic and 
cultural 
cooperation with Taiwan should be a natural process and could 
not be seen by Beijing as an unfriendly step. 
  However, he added, office rent was very high in Taipei, and 
those costs have not been included in Hungary's state budget 
this year. Hasznos and Csepe explained to their hosts in Taipei 
that the Hungarian representative office would be open sooner if 
the Taipei Government understood the financial difficulties and 
put government owned real estate at Hungary's disposal or made a 
cheaper rent possible for the first year. 
  The politicians recalled their visit to Kuomintang 
headquarters where they had emphasized the similarities between 
the Taiwan ruling party and the Hungarian Christian Democrats. 
These similarities would facilitate mutual understanding. 
  "We are both conservatives, nationalists, and 
anti-Communists," he said. 
  Economic relations should be expanded, he explained. "More 
exchange of information is needed," stressed Hasznos. In his 
view cooperations could also explore barter trade because both 
sides have products necessary to the other one. 
  He thinks that Taiwan tourism to Hungary should also be 
developed. He will encourage travel agencies to send 
information to and make bids in Taipei. A good tourism 
relationship would help boost Taiwan tourists to Expo 96, to be 
held in Budapest, he noted.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA) -- Trade with Mainland China 
accounted for 9.27 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade 
during the first ten months of 1993, an indication that Taiwan 
is becoming even more dependent on the mainland market, a Board 
of Foreign Trade (BOFT) official said Tuesday [25 January]. 
  During the January-October period of 1993, cross-Taiwan 
Strait trade totaled US$12.52 billion, the official said, adding 
that Taiwan's foreign trade totaled US$135 billion during the 
period. 
  However, statistics released by Hong Kong customs showed 
trade with Mainland China via Hong Kong totaled only US$7.16 
billion, up 20.05 percent over the same period of last year. 
  Exports to the mainland via Hong Kong grew 24.1 percent over 
1992 tallies to reach US$6.26 billion during the period. While 
imports from Mainland China through the British colony totaled 
US$900 million, down 2.13 percent. 
  However, if statistical differences between Hong Kong and 
BOFT figures are taken into account, Taiwan's exports to 
Mainland China reached US$11.62 billion during the period, 
accounting for 16.41 percent of total exports.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government stands firmly opposed to the official contact between 
Taiwan and countries having diplomatic relations with China, a 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today. 
  When asked to comment on the plan by Li Teng-hui of Taiwan 
to 
"spend his holiday" in some Southeast Asian countries in 
February, he said "we are very concerned about it." 
  Recently, the spokesman noted, the Taiwan authorities have 
been trying to develop `substantive relations' with some 
countries by spending holiday and paying private visits there, 
which is what they call `holiday-making diplomacy'." [no 
beginning quotation mark as received] 
  By so doing, he said, they attempt to squeeze into some 
international and regional organizations and seek the status of 
a "political entity". Therefore, under whatever names and in 
whatever forms, Li Teng-hui's visits to those countries cannot 
cover up his political intention and the official nature of such 
visits, he added. 
  He stated that the Chinese Government stands firmly opposed 
to the official contact between Taiwan and countries having 
diplomatic relations with China. 
  We hope the countries concerned would cherish the fruits of 
the all-round development of their relations with China and be 
alert to the political intention of the Taiwan authorities so as 
to protect the friendly relations and cooperation between China 
and those countries from being disrupted and jeopardized," the 
spokesman said.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Lei (1728 7191) and Zhou Jianmin (0719 </F>
1696 7044)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- When 
delivering a 1993 yearend executive report before the directors 
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
[ARATS], Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of ARATS, said: 
In the past year there has been new progress in ARATS' contact 
with the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF]. Apart from 
consultations, SEF personnel came to the mainland for 
observation, exchange, visiting relatives, and sightseeing in 17 
groups. Among them, there were six independently organized 
groups for sightseeing and cultural study. ARATS, together with 
other relevant departments, received the following groups which 
the SEF organized or participated in organizing: The "cultural 
observation group," "tourist environment study group," "Three 
Gorges cultural assets study group," and the "college youth 
delegation." ARATS and the SEF assisted the relevant 
departments and organizations in organizing children from both 
sides to express their understanding of Tang poetry in the form 
of paintings, and in sponsoring the sports exchange event of 
"race for the health of the Chinese." 
  Tang Shubei mentioned that, entrusted by relevant 
departments, the ARATS asked the SEF to assist in bringing 11 
exchange projects to Taiwan. The highlights included: Beijing 
People's Artistic and Theatrical Company and Beijing Youth Song 
and Dance Ensemble giving performances in Taiwan, and XINHUA 
News Agency and ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE reporters covering the 14th 
Kuomintang Congress in Taiwan. The study group comprising 
persons in charge of mainland media organizations organized by 
ARATS is visiting Taiwan at the moment. ARATS is now making 
active preparations for mainland youth and senior reporters to 
visit Taiwan, in accordance with the provisions of the "Joint 
Agreement of the Wang-Ku Meeting." It has repeatedly approached 
the SEF by letters expressing the wish that the latter would 
help make it possible for mainland industrial and commercial 
entrepreneurs to visit Taiwan for observation and study. We 
hope the relevant authorities in Taiwan will go with the tide 
and lift the ban on the exchange between industrial and 
commercial entrepreneurs across the strait at an early date. 
  In their routine contacts with the SEF, consulting each 
other 
on, and handling, the concrete affairs in the contact between 
the compatriots on the two sides has been an important aspect. 
Tang Shubei said: From January through December last year the 
two associations exchanged 1,249 letters (963 from the SEF to 
ARATS and 286 from the ARATS to SEF), which discussed 369 
issues. We have responded to almost all the letters from the 
SEF. Some of the matters are still being handled. With the 
expansion of ARATS's influence, relevant departments and 
localities have been coming to us, asking us to help promote 
cross-strait exchange activities or solve some specific problems 
arising from their contacts. Last year we were entrusted to 
carry out negotiations with the SEF in handling 70 matters, of 
which 56 have been handled by us. These include: Returning 
Taiwan soldier Tsai Cheng-ta [5591 2398 6671] who had been 
rescued from a dangerous situation, rescuing the crew of the 
mainland's "Zhong Yuan Fishing Boat No. 905," and assisting the 
relevant authorities in a successful mediation in the 
environmental dispute involving "Lu Ta Industries Incorporated," 
a Taiwan-funded enterprise in Xiamen. All those efforts 
generated a positive effect. 
  Tang Shubei finally said: Last year, ARATS assisted the 
relevant departments in handling some Taiwan-connected economic 
and trade disputes, negotiated with the SEF on the handling of 
Taiwan-bound hijackings by mainland criminals and economic 
criminals, and made timely and stern representations regarding 
the barbarous incident of Taiwan's troops stationed on outlying 
islands dispersing and firing at coastal fishermen. From last 
April to now our association has filed 21 incidents involving 
Taiwan businessmen's rights and interests for handling. So far, 
after consulting local Taiwan affairs offices and other relevant 
departments, we have finished handling 13 of them and given 
feedback to the SEF. Two other cases are being handled at the 
moment and local Taiwan affairs offices have been asked to 
continue investigating the remaining six cases. These incidents 
can be divided roughly into three categories. The first 
category covers various economic disputes between Taiwan 
businessmen who were making investments, setting up factories, 
or engaging in economic and trade activities in the mainland as 
one party and, as the other party, some local enterprises or 
institutions. The second category covers incidents in which 
some Taiwan businessmen were handled according to law by the 
competent authorities on the mainland side for practicing fraud 
or maltreating employees. The third category covers cases in 
which a small handful of Taiwan-funded enterprises had clashes 
with local public or were harassed or robbed by lawless persons, 
or the Taiwan investors themselves were beaten up, robbed, 
blackmailed, or, in one or two cases, murdered. When handling 
the above-mentioned incidents, ARATS approached and assisted the 
relevant departments in investigating and handling them in 
accordance with the applicable laws and policies of the state. 
Basically, they were all properly handled. Through these 
efforts, ARATS has accumulated experience in handling 
Taiwan-connected economic and trade disputes and protecting the 
rights and interests of Taiwan investors. Also, the influence 
of the association has been expanded.

<F P=106> [By Ding Yi (0002 0044): "Major Headway Made in </F>
Cross-Strait Relations in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993 cross-strait relations once again made new 
breakthroughs and important headway. The main signs are: 
  --Cross-strait economic links became closer, the number 
of Taiwan businessmen coming to the mainland for investment 
greatly increased, and cross-strait trade interactions rapidly 
developed. 
  Over the past year, our country's political situation was 
steady, our society was stable, and our national economy 
maintained strong growth. Amid various reforms aimed at 
building the socialist market economic system, investment 
environment continuously improved. The great potential in 
economic development and the broad prospects which had been 
revealed continuously attracted numerous investors, traders, and 
industrial and commercial entrepreneurs from Taiwan. Investments 
made by Taiwan businessmen once again greatly increased in 1993, 
on the basis of 1992, a year in which the number of investment 
projects and the agreed upon funds all surpassed the sums of 
former years. According to statistics provided by a relevant 
department, from January to June 1993 the state approved a total 
of 4,891 Taiwan-funded projects, and the agreed upon investment 
funds reached $4.637 billion, an 187 percent increase and a 251 
percent increase respectively over the same period in 1992. A 
relevant person has estimated that in 1993 newly added 
Taiwan-funded projects might reach 10,000, and the agreed upon 
investment funds might exceed $10 billion, ranking Taiwan second 
on the mainland in the drive to attract and utilize foreign 
funds. 
  Another gratifying change in Taiwan investments in the 
mainland during 1993 was that investors developed from medium 
and small enterprises to large consortia and large enterprises, 
and the investment regions rapidly developed from the coastal 
areas and large and medium cities to the interior, remote areas, 
prefectures, counties, towns, and townships. Jiangsu, Shandong, 
Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong are still the areas attracting 
most Taiwan investments, while Qinghai and Tibet also succeeded 
in absorbing and utilizing Taiwan funds for the first time. 
Taiwan-funded enterprises can be found in every province, 
autonomous region, and municipality in the country. Many large 
consortia and enterprises in Taiwan rushed to the mainland for 
inspections and talks, and this undoubtedly created a broader 
perspective for Taiwan businessmen to invest in the mainland. 
Public opinion on the island held that "it was the largest 
scale in collectively going to the mainland for investments" 
since the Taiwan authorities lifted the ban on contacts with the 
mainland in 1987. 
  In the area of cross-strait trade, according to the 
statistics provided by the relevant department, from January to 
September 1993 the total trade volume between the two sides 
passing through the entrepot of Hong Kong reached $6.39 billion, 
a 21.18 percent increase over the same period in 1992. The 
supplementary and reciprocal feature of trade and economic 
development across the strait has already become a common 
understanding on both sides. In order to further promote 
economic cooperation between the two sides of the strait, at the 
end of last year the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC] began to discuss the "PRC Law on Protecting 
Investments by Taiwan Compatriots (draft)." It can be predicted 
that once this bill is adopted and implemented, it will greatly 
promote cross-strait trade and economic development in the 
direction to standardization and institutionalization. 
  --The coming and going of personnel across the strait 
became more frequent, the level continuously rose, and various 
exchanges continuously expanded, bringing in a new phase in 
which the two sides of the strait carried out special 
discussions and academic research together on various domains 
such as politics, economy, science, technology, education, 
culture, and society. 
  According to the statistics provided by the relevant 
department, from January to September 1993 1.155 million Taiwan 
residents visited the mainland, and the figure is expected to 
top 1.6 million for the whole year, thus greatly surpassing the 
1.36 million in 1992, whereas the cumulative sum in the past six 
years would exceed 5 million people. The number of mainland 
residents going to Taiwan also rose greatly. According to 
statistics, 3,309 persons went to Taiwan in 1993 for various 
exchange activities, 3.6 times the figure of 926 in 1992. 
  The two prominent characteristics of the coming and going of 
personnel are the great increase in number and the continuous 
upgrading of level. In June 1993 the Taiwan authorities, 
succumbing to the pressure of opinions from various quarters, 
could not but allow Zhang Kehui, member of NPC Standing 
Committee and president of All-China Federation of Taiwan 
Compatriots, to hasten home to Taiwan for the funeral of his 
parent, and this was a breakthrough in the visits to Taiwan by 
senior personnel from the mainland. The visits to Taiwan for 
exchanges activities by well-known mainland personnel such as 
Wang Fosong, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; 
Liu Ji, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences; He Zhenliang, president of the Chinese Olympic 
Committee; Wang Meng, former culture minister; Ying Ruocheng, 
former vice minister of culture; and Bao Yujun, deputy editor in 
chief of RENMIN RIBAO, all aroused greater responses on the 
island. 
  The number of senior personnel coming from Taiwan to the 
mainland for exchange activities also markedly increased over 
1992, and among them were "members of the National Assembly," 
"members of the Legislative Yuan," "adviser to the presidential 
palace," members of the Standing Committee of the Central 
Committee of the Kuomintang, and main leaders of other political 
parties. Seeing for oneself is a hundred times better than 
hearing from others. The frequent exchanges of personnel across 
the strait and the upgrading of level are helpful to enhancing 
mutual understanding between the people on both sides of the 
strait, as well as among persons of various circles of the 
society, so that they can foster compassion and increase 
consensus. Their significance and influence are obvious and 
profound. 
  When the coming and going of personnel from both sides of 
the 
strait became more frequent, various exchanges across the strait 
also continuously expanded and deepened, scoring rich results. 
Last year, apart from the bilateral exchanges in the domains 
such as culture, education, science, technology, film, 
television, news, and health, which continued to develop, other 
domains such as religion, tourism, architecture, finance, 
securities, land management, sports, and social customs also 
realized bilateral exchanges. What must be mentioned in 
particular is cultural exchange, which involved a large number 
of people and large projects, and had good effects. The 
performances by the China School of Beijing Opera, the Beijing 
School of Beijing Opera, Sichuan's Sichuan Opera Troupe, Hubei's 
Hankou Troupe, Beijing People's Arts Troupe, and Young Chinese 
Arts Troupe, as well as the exhibition of wood and clay figures 
of ancient warriors and horses, the exhibition of the jade 
clothes sewn with gold thread, the visit by Yunmen Dance 
Performing Troupe to Taiwan, and the first cross-strait movies 
show all had great impacts and changed the past pattern whereby 
Taiwan pop singers "dominated" the mainland. The cultural 
exchanges between the two sides of the strait are developing in 
the multilevel, multi-domain, and high- taste direction. The 
success in the cross-strait cultural exchanges illustrated that 
Chinese culture has tremendous rallying force, and is an 
important foundation for the two sides of the strait to 
establish consensus and mutual trust. 
  Another feature of the continuously deepening bilateral 
exchanges across the strait last year was that there was an 
increasing number of various seminars jointly held by both sides 
of the strait, and the contents became richer and touched on 
cross-strait relations, as well as economic, industrial, 
cultural, educational, scientific, and technological 
topics....The discussions on areas and topics by various 
quarters from both sides of the strait will undoubtedly play a 
positive role in developing cross-strait economic, social, and 
cultural ties, and in strengthening the links and interactions 
among various circles on both sides of the strait. They can 
also enlighten both sides when they sit down for consultations 
and negotiations, and seek peaceful reunification of the country. 
  --Smoothly holding the "talks between Wang Daohan and 
Koo Cheng- fu," realizing official contacts and discussions 
between the senior- level persons of the nongovernmental domain, 
and making an historic and important step forward in the 
development of relations between the two sides of the 
strait. 
  The "Wang-Ku talks" were the most eye-catching event in the 
development of relations between the two sides of the strait in 
1993. It was held at the end of April last year in Singapore, 
after efforts made jointly by both sides. It was the first 
meeting of the most senior persons of the empowered 
nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the strait, as 
well as the first open contact and discussion between the 
senior-level persons in nongovernmental capacity in more than 40 
years. It had great significance and profound impact, and it 
drew a widespread attention from both sides of the strait and 
the international community. 
  As part of that nongovernmental, economic, routine, and 
functional meeting, basing themselves on the spirit of mutual 
respect, of consultation on equal footing, of being practical, 
and of seeking common point while allowing differences, both 
sides seriously discussed the relevant problems, reached 
consensus on many areas, and signed the four documents of the 
"Wang-Ku Talks Joint Accord," the "Agreement on Ties and System 
of Talks Between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF]," the 
"Agreement on Examination and Verification of Notarial Deeds in 
Use on Both Sides of the Strait," and the "Agreement on 
Cross-Strait Enquiry Into Registered Mail and the Matter of 
Compensation," scoring results which satisfied both sides. The 
complete success in this round of talks played a positive role 
in promoting forward development of cross- strait relations and 
in fostering peaceful reunification of the country. President 
Jiang Zemin spoke highly of it, and he said: "The Wang-Ku 
meeting is successful and fruitful, signifying that the 
development of cross-strait relations has made a historic and 
important step." 
  In order to thoroughly implement the relevant agreements 
reached by the talks, the ARATS and SEF held work meetings in 
late August, early November, and mid-December in Beijing, 
Xiamen, and Taipei. Both sides discussed the matters such as 
repatriation of personnel, fishing disputes, repatriation of 
hijackers, and the way to arrange trips for the work personnel 
from the ARATS and SEF. Both sides also exchanged ideas and 
reached some consensus on protecting the rights and benefits of 
Taiwan investors on the mainland, as well as the related 
problems, and on the issue of visits by the persons of 
industrial and commercial circles from both sides of the strait. 
This enabled the routine talks between the two sides of the 
strait to be further deepened. 
  --The publishing of the white paper on "The Taiwan 
Question and China's Reunification," has for the first time 
systematically and openly explained the cause of the Taiwan 
question, its current situation, and the crux of the problem. 
It also explained the Chinese Government's position, idea, and 
basic policy on solving the Taiwan question. 
  The white paper resolutely safeguarded state sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, sternly refuted the fallacious theories 
such as "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "Taiwan 
independence." The white paper also clearly pointed out: "The 
wishes of Taiwan compatriots to become masters of their homes 
and to administer Taiwan are reasonable and proper, and this is 
not like `Taiwan independence' and they are basically different 
from a very small handful of those who insist on following the 
road of `Taiwan independence.'" The white paper, after being 
published, aroused enthusiastic responses in the international 
community and on the island of Taiwan, and scored very good 
results. It has already produced -- and will continue to 
produce -- a more profound impact on the development of 
cross-strait ties and reunification of the country. 
  In conclusion, 1993 was a year in which the development of 
cross- strait ties made a new breakthrough and important 
headway. The situation continues to develop in the direction 
which is conducive to the peaceful reunification of the country. 
Over the past year, in order to promote the development of ties 
across the strait and to realize peaceful reunification of the 
country sooner, the CPC and the Chinese Government adopted a 
series of important measures to promote various exchanges and 
interactions across the strait, as well as nongovernmental 
contacts and talks, and to promote direct "three links," winning 
the support and approval from people on both sides of the 
strait. At the same time, the Taiwan authorities also further 
lifted certain restrictions on cross-strait exchanges and 
interactions, and adopted some measures which helped fostering 
communications and understanding, and this is in accordance with 
the wishes and interests of the people in the whole country, 
including the compatriots in Taiwan, and this is also conducive 
to the benevolent development of ties between the two sides of 
the strait. 
  However, over the past year, the development of relations 
between the two sides of the strait still experienced some 
twists, turns, obstructions, and variables. The main reason 
rested on the island of Taiwan. Over the past year, the 
struggle among various political forces on the island 
intensified, in particular, the Taiwan authorities advocated 
"participation in the United Nations," put forward so-called 
"phase-nature policy of two Chinas," and fell back on the 
one-China position, while the trend of thought of "Taiwan 
independence" ran rampant on the island. This produced 
unfavorable influence on the development of cross-strait ties, 
and met with the strong opposition from the people on both sides 
of the strait, as well as from Overseas Chinese. There is only 
one China in this world, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of 
Chinese territory, any attempt to pursue "two Chinas" "one 
China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan independence" cannot succeed. 
  Although things are not always smooth in the course of 
reunification of the country, reunification of the country 
accords with the will of the people, and this general trend of 
history is one which cannot be changed by any force. We believe 
that in the new year, cross-strait ties will continue to have a 
bigger development, and cross-strait interactions and 
cooperation will still maintain the tendency of rapid 
development. We hope that, proceeding from the basic interest 
of the Chinese nation, the Taiwan authorities will continue to 
uphold the principle of one China, further remove various 
artificial obstacles to political contacts and negotiations 
between the two sides of the strait, and do more practical 
things in order to develop cross-strait relations and foster 
reunification of the country.

  [Excerpt] Hong Kong, 13 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN 
SHE)--According to a report from Taipei, Taiwan's "Investment 
Examination Committee of the Ministry of Economy" said yesterday 
that last year the committee had approved a total of over $3.16 
billion of investment in mainland China by Taiwanese 
businessmen, and the amount ranked first in external investment 
by Taiwan businessmen. 
  An official concerned of Taiwan's "Investment Examination 
Committee of the Ministry of Economy" admitted that although 
Taiwan businessmen increased their investment in Southeast Asia, 
they had invested more in the mainland. This shows the mainland 
remains the first choice for Taiwan businessmen investing 
outside the island. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has expressed willingness to 
co- operate with its counterparts from Taiwan in offshore oil 
exploration and development, an informed source said here today. 
  Chen Bingqian, CNOOC's vice-president, was quoted as saying 
the two sides can join their efforts in "whatever forms are 
acceptable to both." 
  He made the remark at a meeting with a delegation from 
Taiwan's China Technical Consultants, Inc., whose members are 
mainly from Taiwan's China Petroleum Corporation. 
  Chen told the delegation that CNOOC has forged links with 
leading oil producers all over the world in the past decade and 
struck 95 contracts and agreements with 54 oil companies from 13 
countries on offshore oil development. 
  However, he said, "It is a great pity that our counterparts 
across the Taiwan Straits have been deprived of such 
opportunities." 
  The 11-member team from Taiwan is visiting the mainland to 
study the petroleum and petrochemical industries in the coastal 
areas and seek ways to co-operate. 
  Chen said co-operation between the mainland and Taiwan can 
take many forms. The CNOOC can co-operate with the Taiwan 
corporation directly or with its overseas subsidiaries; it can 
co-operate with conglomerates grouping the Taiwan corporation's 
overseas subsidiaries and foreign companies; and it can also 
co-operate with independently-registered overseas companies 
formed by the Taiwan corporation and foreign firms, he proposed. 
  He welcomed the corporation to render technical services for 
the offshore operations carried out by the CNOOC and its foreign 
partners. 
  The two sides can concentrate co-operative efforts on oil 
exploration in the Taiwan Straits, the southwestern offshore 
basin of Taiwan and the Chaoshan Depression, blocks in the East 
China Sea and other offshore areas of interest, he added. 
  The vice-president also briefed the delegation on the 
development of the CNOOC and its co-operation with foreign oil 
companies at the request of the guests, the informed source said. 
  The delegation, at the invitation of the China Petrochemical 
Corporation (Sinopec), arrived in Beijing January 6 to start a 
month-long survey of oil and gas exploration and development, 
oil refining, and the production and sale of petrochemical 
products in the coastal areas. 
  According to the source, the team members showed enthusiasm 
in raising questions and seeking co-operative projects. 
  The two sides reached agreement on enhancing exchanges 
across 
the Straits to end more than 40 years of isolation and find new 
ways for co-operation. 
  Chen also asked the delegation to convey the greetings of 
CNOOC President Wang Yan to the heads of the Taiwan corporation, 
and said he hoped for early formal high-level contacts between 
the two sides. 
  It was reported that the Taiwan corporation's leadership has 
announced considering flexible approaches for cross-Straits co- 
operation and has been working actively in this regard. 
  The source said many indications suggest a softening of 
Taiwan's policy on investment flow to the mainland, which gives 
rise to a "cautiously optimistic prospect" for co-operative oil 
exploration. 
  The delegation is scheduled to end its survey February 5 
before returning to Taiwan.

  [Excerpts] A provincial meeting on commodity prices was 
held in Xining on 21 and 22 January. The meeting analyzed 
commodity prices in the province and discussed a detailed 
program on further carrying out price reform, strengthening 
macrocontrol and regulation, and controlling price hikes. Vice 
Governor Liu Guanghe addressed the meeting. 
  He said: Last year the province implemented some price 
reform measures, as a result the price structure was further 
adjusted. This played a positive role in stimulating production, 
invigorating the circulation field, making the market 
prosperous, and propelling economic development. But there were 
also price increases in the province's economic operations. 
This mainly found expression in excessive price hikes after 
July, which caused an annual increase of 12.3 percent in 
commodity prices. [passage omitted] 
  Liu Guanghe continued: This year is a year of making overall 
progress and breaking through focal points in economic 
structural reform and is also a crucial year to fulfill the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan. To maintain social stability and ensure 
the healthy development of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, the provincial party committee and government 
demand that price increases in retail sales of commodities in 
society be controlled at approximately 10 percent. To achieve 
this end, the following points should be given attention. 
  First, proper management should be exercised over the 
momentum of reform. In accordance with central uniform 
arrangements, the province's main task in deepening price reform 
is to relax control over the prices of competitive commodities 
under the precondition of maintaining a relatively stable total 
price level, to rationalize the small number of commodity prices 
and service charges fixed by the government, to gradually 
abolish the two-track system for prices of production materials, 
to speed up the marketization of production factors, to 
establish and improve the reserve system for important 
commodities, and to control their market prices. [passage 
omitted] 
  In principle, no locality or department should introduce new 
price increases; if any price increases are to be introduced, 
these should be submitted to the provincial price bureau for 
approval. 
  Second, macrocontrol and regulation should be strengthened 
and excessive price hikes should be controlled. A reserve 
system should be established for major commodities. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Xining, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Geological workers 
in northwest China's Qinghai Province have recently discovered a 
strontium deposit in the Qaidam Basin. 
  Situated in the northwest part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 
the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province is one of China's four 
inland basins, and its deposits of sodium, potassium, magnesium, 
lithium and bromine rank first in the country. 
  Jin Wanfu, chief engineer of the Geological and Mining 
Bureau, said the strontium deposit added greatly to the value of 
the basin. 
  He said that the strontium deposit found in the basin 
amounts 
to more than 18 million tons. 
  He said that the deposit is near the surface and easy to 
extract. 
  Strontium is one of the materials for making electronic 
video 
tubes and strontium products are in strong demand at home and 
abroad. 
  Qinghai Province has now set up a national strontium salt 
production association to coordinate the processing of strontium 
products in the country. 
  Geologists have also discovered a 1,100-square-kilometer 
lake 
containing strontium. About 20 million cubic meters of the 
water can be made use of annually .

  [Text] The Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Xinjiang Autonomous Regional CPC Committee met this morning. 
Song Hanliang, secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee, presided over the meeting. Leading Comrades Abulaiti 
Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Jin Yunhui, Wang Lequan, Keyum 
Bawudun, (Guo Gang), Zhou Shengtao, Hailiqiemu Silamu, Pan 
Zhaomin, and (Li Fengzi) attended the meeting. [Video shows

Shengtao, Hailiqiemu Silamu, Pan Zhaomin, and (Li Fengzi), and 
wide shots of several hundred attendees in a hall, as well as 
closeups of Abulaiti Amudurexiti delivering a speech] 
  Abulaiti Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous 
regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous 
region, delivered a report entitled "Comprehensively Implement 
the Guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and Accelerate Xinjiang's Reform, Opening Up, 
and Modernization." 
  He said: In 1993, the people of all nationalities in 
Xinjiang thoroughly implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important talks and the guidelines of the 14th national party 
congress and actively carried out the tasks put forward by the 
fifth enlarged plenary session of the fourth autonomous regional 
party committee. Our economy continued to maintain a fairly 
high growth rate. The gross product for 1993 is expected to be 
37.7 billion yuan, or up about 10 percent from 1992. The 
autonomous region enjoys economic development, political 
stability, unity between nationalities, and social progress. 
The general situation is good. However, we have soberly 
realized that while other parts of the country are accelerating 
their reform and development, the gap between Xinjiang and the 
interior and coastal provinces and regions is constantly 
widening. This year is a year of reform, and the state is 
comprehensively promoting fiscal and tax, banking, investment, 
and planning systems reforms. We are facing a rigorous test in 
accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure. We must strive to adapt ourselves to the situation. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should fully 
understand the situation, formulate concrete measures while 
considering realities, turn passivity into activity, and change 
unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. At the same time, 
we should know that during the shift from the old to the new 
structure, new circumstances and new problems will inevitably 
emerge in our economic and social life, and they will create 
some difficulties for our work. 
  Abulaiti Amudurexiti said: In light of the new situation 
created in the process of establishing a socialist market 
economy and taking Xinjiang's specific conditions into 
consideration, our guiding ideology for accelerating economic 
development is: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we 
will implement in an all-around way the guidelines of the 14th 
National Party Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee; take reform as an impetus to focus our 
efforts on development; make use of our favorable natural 
resource conditions to adjust our industrial structure; open 
ourselves wider to the outside world; and increase economic 
efficiency to bring about the rapid and highly efficient 
development of the national economy [shi xian guo min jing ji 
kuai su gao xiao fa zhan] and raise Xinjiang's overall economic 
strength to enable it to enter the level of a comfortable life 
along with the rest of the country. Based on this guiding 
ideology, our development strategy is to orient toward three 
markets, seize three major Opportunities, take advantage of our 
strong position in two aspects, and achieve breakthroughs in 
four aspects. Specifically, we must orient ourselves toward the 
domestic and international, as well as Xinjiang's regional 
markets; seize the Opportunities brought by a national policy of 
encouraging industrial development in Western China, by the 
completion of the second Eurasian Continental Bridge, and by the 
development of our petroleum industry; take advantage of our 
strong position in natural resources and in geographical 
location; and achieve breakthroughs in the transformation of 
traditional industries by focusing primarily on improving 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and changing 
enterprise operating mechanism, in the development of the local 
economy by concentrating on mass-scale agriculture and secondary 
and tertiary industries, in foreign trade and international 
economic and technological cooperation by opening our doors wide 
on every side and diversifying the international market, and in 
services and other industries related to oil exploration and 
development. From now on, we need to concentrate on carrying 
out the following tasks: Continue to strengthen the position of 
agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and accelerate the 
development of agriculture and the rural economy; vigorously 
develop the rural economy and revitalize the local economy by 
focusing on secondary and tertiary industries; step up the 
construction of infrastructure and basic industries to improve 
our ability to achieve sustained economic growth; accelerate 
technological transformation of our enterprises by orienting 
ourselves toward the market; open wider to the outside world and 
do a good job in foreign trade and economic relations; step up 
the development of oil and other industries in which we have 
strong resources to promote local economic development; and show 
concern about the masses' well-being and bring tangible benefits 
to them. 
  Speaking of all-around in-depth reform to increase the 
motive 
force and vitality of economic development, Abulaiti Amudurexiti 
said: We must further emancipate our minds, change our way of 
thinking, and based on the tasks laid down in the decision of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
keep in step with the rest of the country in terms of the 
general reform programs while boldly blazing new trails and 
advancing in a pioneering spirit to tackle major problems of 
economic development in light of Xinjiang's reality. We must 
earnestly conduct experiments to build a modern enterprise 
system and carry out basic work to change the operating 
mechanism of state-owned enterprises. We must change the 
government's functions, strengthen and improve our ability to 
macroeconomically adjust and control the regional economic 
operation. We must step up the cultivation and development of a 
regional market system based primarily on the market of 
essential factors of production. We must deepen our foreign 
trade structure and open ourselves wider to the outside world. 
We must continue to deepen rural reform and establish a rural 
economic operation and management system that meets the 
requirements of a socialist market economy. We must step up the 
reform of our social security and housing systems to create a 
favorable condition for our region's reform to advance in depth 
and breadth. We must further deepen our scientific and 
technological and educational structural reform. 
  Abulaiti Amudurexiti also gave specific instructions on 
earnestly strengthen party leadership to ensure the smooth 
progress of reform, opening up, and modernization.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing 
Municipal Government intends to take further steps to improve 
quality and efficiency in utilizing foreign investments. 
  This was stated at a municipal comprehensive economic 
working 
meeting held recently. 
  Efforts will be made from now to improve the investment 
environment of Beijing, shift investment directions and 
diversify the forms of utilizing foreign funds. 
  The municipal government will attach much importance to 
investment from transnational corporations and investments to be 
used for urban infrastructure construction, major national 
projects and high-tech projects. 
  Profit-earning and efficiency will be stressed in utilizing 
foreign funds, instead of merely asking for increased numbers of 
projects and expansion in the amount of investment. 
  Diversified and more flexible forms will be adopted in 
utilizing foreign funds, such as introducing share-holding 
systems, contacts with overseas investment funds and issuing of 
"b"-shares -- shares which companies in China issue solely for 
foreigners to buy. 
  A more authoritative and sensitive information network 
offering latest information to foreign investors will be 
established soon. 
  Approval procedures for foreign-funded projects will be 
simplified and different procedures will be followed for 
different kinds of projects. 
  Implementation of related laws and regulations will be 
strengthened to protect the interests of all sides involved. 
  Fifteen years of reform and opening-up of the country has 
brought about establishment of 7,500 overseas-funded enterprises 
in Beijing and an imported investment totalling ten billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  The opening drive reached its zenith last year with newly 
approved foreign-funded enterprises reaching 3,752 in number, 
almost equalling that for all the previous 14 years put 
together. Last year's batch included 49 large-scale projects 
involving foreign funds of at least 50 million u.s. dollars each. 
  Among foreign investors in Beijing, the number of 
world-renowned transnational corporations has reached 60.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The two-year-old 
Beijing Association for Overseas Exchanges, a nongovernmental 
organization, has become a bridge between the city and overseas 
countries and regions in economic and trade relations. 
  Speaking at the organization's annual meeting, its president 
He Luli said that during the past two years the association has 
helped conduct economic and trade activities in various forms 
and through different channels, thus greatly promoting economic 
and trade co-operation between Beijing and the rest of the world. 
  The association, currently composed of 20 members of the 
city's industrial, commercial, trade and service companies, aims 
to tighten economic and trade connections between the members 
and their overseas counterparts. 
  It also has 12 overseas advisers in Hong Kong, the United 
States, Britain, Thailand, the Netherlands, and other countries 
and regions. 
  During the past two years the association has received over 
2,300 overseas economic, scientific, technical and financial 
personnel as well as 26 economic and trade inspection teams. 
The visits have helped conclude agreements on joint-venture 
projects involving hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, the 
president said. 
  At a 1992 exchange fair sponsored by the association more 
than 130 overseas Chinese entrepreneurs from 15 countries and 
regions, including the U.S., Japan, Britain, Indonesia and Hong 
Kong and Macao, signed more than 130 contracts, agreements and 
letters of intent with Beijing's large and medium state-owned 
enterprises, involving direct overseas investment of over 35 
million U.S dollars. 
  The association, exploiting its vast network of connections 
overseas, has so far helped more than 80 enterprises in the city 
build up ties with their counterparts abroad. 
  It also invites overseas experts and scholars to chair 
seminars and give lectures on quality management and commercial 
law for the city's economic and trade professionals. 
  He Luli held that such exchanges have helped push Chinese 
companies and products onto the world market and improved their 
competitiveness. 
  The president said that this year the association is going 
to 
invite more overseas advisers and renowned personages to Beijing 
for business exchanges and trade talks. Meanwhile, it will 
designate team members to carry out business activities in 
Europe, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.

<F P=106> [By Chen Li (7115 0500): "The Fifth Autonomous Regional </F>
Party Committee Convenes its Eighth `Enlarged' Plenary Session"] 
  [Text] The eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth 
autonomous regional party committee ceremoniously opened in 
Hohhot on 22 December. 
  The purposes of the (enlarged) plenary session are to 
implement the spirit of decisions adopted at the Third Plenum of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of the 
socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the guidance of the 14th CPC 
Congress' guidelines; to put forward tasks and ideas for the 
region to accelerate the reform and development and to safeguard 
the unity and stability in line with the target of establishing 
the systems of socialist market economy; and to mobilize all 
Communist Party members as well as the cadres and people of 
various nationalities across the region to unite as one, to wage 
arduous struggles, and to concentrate their thinking and energy 
on accelerating the reform and development so that they can 
greet the new and crucial year and create a new situation with 
the mental attitude of emancipating minds and daring to pioneer 
and to try to promote the sustained, accelerated, and healthy 
development of the region's economy. 
  During the plenary session Wang Qun, secretary of the 
autonomous regional party committee, delivered a report entitled 
"Reinforce the Strength in Reforms, Accelerate the Economic 
Development, Vigorously Create a New Situation for Establishing 
the Systems of Socialist Market Economy." Wu Liji, deputy 
secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and 
chairman of the autonomous regional people's government, 
presided over yesterday's plenary session, which was also 
attended by Qian Fenyong and Bai Enpei, deputy secretaries of 
the autonomous regional party committee; as well as Geroletu, 
Yang Enbo, and Wuyunqimuge, members of the autonomous regional 
party standing committee. 
  Comrade Wang Qun's report includes the following five parts: 
1) The brief summation of 1993 work; 2) Efforts should be made 
to apply the spirit of "decisions" adopted at the Third Plenum 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee to unify thinking and to 
enhance the people's morale in line with the grand target of 
"being the advanced"; 3) Efforts should be made to promote the 
sustained, accelerated, and healthy development of the national 
economy and to ensure the fulfillment of the two periodical 
targets within the given date; 4) Efforts should be made to 
promote reform in an overall way, to make breakthroughs in key 
fields, and to accelerate the pace of establishing the socialist 
market economy system; 5) Efforts should be further made to 
enhance or improve the party's leadership and to unswervingly 
implement the principle of "building the two civilizations 
simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them." 
  Wang Qun said: Over the past year the concept of socialist 
market economy has been accepted by an increasingly large number 
of people. In particular, leadership at all levels has greatly 
upgraded their understanding on the socialist market economy. 
Reforms conducted in line with the target of establishing the 
systems of socialist market economy have achieved new progress. 
The economic structure has been further improved under the 
guide of markets and of macro readjustment and control. Both 
urban and rural productive forces have been emancipated or 
achieved development in the course of reform and opening up. 
Their specific manifestations are as follows: The reform in 
rural and pastoral areas has achieved new progress and a bumper 
harvest in both agriculture and animal husbandry has been 
obtained in the disaster-plagued year. The industrial and 
commercial enterprises have steadily deepened their reform and 
their economic results have somewhat increased. The activities 
of introducing foreign advanced technologies and setting up 
technical and economic associations with domestic localities 
have taken a new step. The pace in building the basic 
industries of energy resources, communications, 
telecommunication, and raw materials, as well as in building 
infrastructures has been quickened. Township enterprises have 
fostered a trend of doubling their output value and privately 
owned enterprises have achieved faster development. The 
principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and 
scoring achievements in both of them" have been further 
implemented, new achievements in party building and in the 
construction of spiritual civilization have been scored, and the 
political situation of unity and stability has been further 
consolidated. Wang Qun said: While fully acknowledging the 
achievements and the main stream in the current situation, we 
must also analyze by seeking truth from facts the difficulties 
and problems cropping up along our advancing road. We should 
also note that along with gradually deepening the reform and 
developing the undertakings of modernization, it is possible for 
us to gradually deal with these problems and difficulties. 
  In his report Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: We should 
apply the spirit of the "decisions" adopted at the Third Plenum 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee to unify thinking and enhance 
the people's morale in line with the grand target of "being the 
advanced." He said: The decisions adopted at the third plenum 
represent an important policy decision, a grand blueprint of 
turning the old economic system into a new one, and a guiding 
principle of leading the entire party and the people of various 
nationalities throughout the country to accelerate the reform 
and development in a timely manner. By regarding the 
implementation of these decisions as a sign, we can be sure that 
our country's programs of conducting reform among the economic 
systems and of carrying out economic construction have entered a 
new development period. At present, a good job should be done 
in emphatically dealing with the following problems: 1) Efforts 
should be made to adopt a correct attitude toward the region's 
strong points under the conditions of socialist market economy 
and to enhance the confidence in quickening development; 2) 
Efforts should be made to smash the fetter of old thinking and 
concepts developed under the system of the planned economy and 
to foster the new thinking and concepts of socialist market 
economy; 3) Efforts should be made to firmly foster or to always 
uphold the criterion of "three advantages" and to apply this 
criterion to analyzing the new situation, new problems, and new 
things cropping up in the course of establishing new systems as 
well as to measuring the failure or success cropping up in 
reforms. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to correctly deal 
with the relations among reform, development, and stability and 
successfully deal with the relation between the whole interest 
and the partial one, as well as the relation between the 
immediate difficulty and the distant view of development. He 
said: In 1987 Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out in his 
speech: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is endowed with vast 
grassland and has a small population. It is possible for the 
region to be advanced in development in the future. This 
judgment represents his ardent hope for the region and his 
scientific foresight and the people of various nationalities 
throughout the region should regard his judgment as a spiritual 
motive force. The grand target of "being the advanced" shows 
the region's glorious prospects in economic and social 
development and conforms with the fundamental interest and 
common desire of the people of various nationalities throughout 
the region. By judging from the development of both domestic 
and foreign situations, from the tendency of the state 
macroeconomic policies, and from the region's existing 
foundation and development potential, it is possible for us to 
realize the grand target through a longer period of arduous 
struggles. We should regard the grand target as a banner and 
guide the people of various nationalities throughout the region 
to have lofty ambitions and to make unswerving efforts to 
realize the target. 
  In his report Wang Qun said: In order to realize the grand 
target, it is imperative to fulfill in a timely manner the two 
periodical targets put forward at the sixth (enlarged) plenary 
session of the fifth autonomous regional party committee; to 
become better-off by the end of this century; and to reach the 
level that is little higher than the national intermediate level 
in this regard. This is the second year in fulfilling the first 
periodical target and a failure or success in economic 
development has a vital bearing on whether we can realize the 
first periodical target on schedule. Therefore, we should adopt 
every possible way and means to successfully conduct the 
economic work in 1994 and to achieve faster progress in economic 
development. In line with the current situation in the region's 
economic development, the region's gross national product may 
show a 10 percent increase in 1994 and we should strive to show 
a 12 percent increase. In order to realize the increasing 
speed, it is imperative to work out a new way with economic 
results as a center for developing the economy. A good job 
should be done in emphatically grasping the following tasks: 1) 
Efforts should be made to actively consolidate the structure of 
agriculture and animal husbandry and to further accelerate the 
economic development in rural and pastoral areas; 2) A good job 
should be done in emphatically encouraging enterprises to show 
an increase in both speed and economic results and to take up 
the work of switching losses to profits to improve industrial 
production across the region to a new level; 3) A good job 
should be done in continuously establishing pillar industries 
and in building key projects to add actual and reserve strength 
to the region's economic development; 4) Efforts should be made 
to vigorously develop township enterprises and to enhance the 
actual strength of the banner-county economy; 5) Efforts should 
be made to let the society continuously have a free hand in 
developing publicly owned enterprises. 
  Wang Qun said: A fundamental way to accelerate the economic 
development in the region lies in seizing the opportunity of 
reforms, reinforcing the strength in reforms, and quickening the 
pace in establishing the systems of the socialist market 
economy. Proceeding from the region's reality, a good job should 
be done in realistically grasping the following reforms: 1) 
Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace in enterprise 
reform by regarding as an orientation the establishment of 
modern enterprise systems and regarding the task of 
straightening out the relations among property rights as a 
breakthrough; 2) Efforts should be made to further deepen the 
reform in rural and pastoral areas by emphasizing the task of 
establishing or improving the socialized service systems of 
agriculture and animal husbandry; 3) Efforts should be made to 
accelerate the pace of fostering and perfecting the market 
systems by emphasizing the task of establishing the markets of 
essential factors for production; 4) Efforts should be made to 
accelerate the pace of conducting reform among organs by 
emphasizing the task of shifting the governmental function; 5) 
Efforts should be made to ensure the implementation of measures 
for conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control by 
emphasizing the task of conducting reform among the systems of 
finance and tax, banking, investment, and planning; 6) Efforts 
should be made to accelerate the reform among the systems of 
public security by regarding as a breakthrough the method of the 
society making overall arrangements for severance pay; 7) 
Efforts should be made to further deepen the reform among the 
systems of science, technology, and education to meet the needs 
of reform, opening up, and economic construction; 8) Efforts 
should be made to open the region in an overall way to 
localities both at home and abroad by regarding as a 
breakthrough the task of vigorously bringing in foreign advanced 
technologies and vigorously setting up economic and technical 
associations with domestic localities. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: In order to win a victory in directing 
these unprecedented and pioneering undertakings, we must 
realistically enhance the party's self improvement and provide a 
strong and effective political guarantee for reform, opening up, 
and modernization. We must unswervingly and persistently carry 
forward the strategic principle of "building the two 
civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of 
them" and create a good social environment for accelerating the 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. Wang Qun urged 
that in enhancing the party building, it is most important for 
us to apply the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with 
regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Efforts should be made to enable the leading body to become a 
strong and effective core of political leadership, which is 
leading the masses to establish the new systems of socialist 
market economy. A good job should be done in realistically 
building socialist spiritual civilization by regarding as a 
target the task of training new successors in conformity with 
the "four requirements" and by following the principle of 
regarding construction as an important point and regarding 
upholding as a precious point. Efforts should be made to 
successfully conduct the party's united front work in the new 
historic period, to enhance the work involved in nationalities' 
affairs and religious affairs, and to bring all contributing 
factors into play. By earnestly implementing the central 
arrangements, efforts should be made to steadily deepen the 
struggle against corruption. 
  Attending the plenary session were members and alternate 
members of the autonomous regional party committee; members of 
the party committee (leading party group) under the autonomous 
regional people's congress, the regional people's government, 
the regional Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
committee, the regional military district, and the regional 
discipline inspection commission; veteran comrades who had long 
worked in the region; responsible persons from the party and 
government organs of various leagues, cities, banners, and 
counties, (county-level cities and districts); as well as 
party-member responsible comrades from the regional level 
departments, commissions, offices, and bureaus, as well as from 
the mass organizations, the higher educational institutions, and 
a number of large enterprises and establishments. 
  At the preparatory meeting for the plenary session on the 
evening of 21 December, Comrade Qian Fenyong delivered a speech 
on the session's tasks and significance, as well as on the 
methods and demands for proceeding the session.

Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, on understanding gained after 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping: "Master the Ideological Line To Answer Actual 
Questions"] 
  [Text] The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping is very rich in content. It involves all the 
fields of the contemporary social and political life and 
summarizes all the basic viewpoints of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Although it embraces 
such extensive knowledge and profound scholarship, it explains 
them in simple terms in close connection with reality, thus 
touching our hearts. Many things it mentions are what we have 
personally experienced, but never conscientiously summarized. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions enable us to suddenly see 
the light and gain much benefit. Reading through Volume 3, we 
have a particular feeling that, at the beginning, we often 
cannot not understand or can understand merely superficially the 
whole meaning of Comrade Xiaoping's profound ideological 
viewpoints and broad and long-term policy decisions; and that, 
as time goes by, as we are educated through practice, and, in 
particular, as these viewpoints and policy decisions yield 
tremendous achievements in the course of practice, we will be 
able to gain a fairly profound understanding after we review 
them. It is thus clear that it is not easy to acquire a true 
understanding, not to mention mastery, of the book after reading. 
  The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping is underlined by the ideological line of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, which is the 
quintessence and soul of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. The great practice of reform, opening 
up, and the modernization drive after the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th party Central Committee was started exactly with 
this reestablished ideological line. This line is a condensed 
summary of dialectical materialism and historical materialism 
and the epitome of the proletarian world outlook and 
methodology. Following this line to understand reality from 
objective viewpoints, we will find correct answers to the many 
theoretical and practical questions, however complicated they 
may be. In the following, proceeding from the ideological line, 
I will discuss my shallow understanding on some major 
theoretical and practical questions. 
<H5>  1. Why Should China "Take Its Own Road" for Its Development? </H5>
  The opening article of Volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping contains a very incisive theory: "Our 
modernization drive should proceed from China's reality. In 
either revolution or construction, we should pay attention to 
learning and drawing lessons from foreign experiences. However, 
success can never be achieved by mechanically copying the 
experiences and patterns of foreign countries. We have had many 
lessons in this. The basic conclusion we have reached after 
summarizing the long historical experiences is that we should 
integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the specific 
reality of our country, take our own road, and build socialism 
with Chinese characteristics." (Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp 2-3) These 100-odd characters 
coagulate the achievements of the party's long practice and 
experiences and its theoretical explorations, show the party's 
basic political proposition concerning the road of development, 
and epitomize the basic essence of the ideological line of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. 
  Socialist construction and the road of development are basic 
issues deciding on the future and destiny of socialism. 
Historical experiences told us that leaving these issues 
unresolved, it is impossible for us to find a universally 
applicable pattern or road of development. "Taking our own road 
and building socialism with Chinese characteristics" is a 
concise and comprehensive theory that pinpoints the essence of 
the issue on the road of development. Its meaning in theory and 
practice also lies in the fact that it corrects the tendency of 
deviation from practice concerning the issues on socialist 
construction and road of development and provides answers to 
both the doubts and censures form the "left" and the right. It 
opens up the only correct course for our socialist modernization. 
  Why should China "take its own road and build socialism 
with Chinese characteristics?" According to my understanding, 
we should answer this question from three aspects. 
  First, because we cannot find a correct road from books. 
"Because such a thing as building socialism in China cannot be 
found either in the books on Marxism or the books of Lenin." 
(Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 
260) Although Marxist theory on socialism provided principled 
plans for socialist construction, neither Marx nor Lenin 
provided or could provide a ready plan for a country to build 
socialism after they died. Just as Comrade Xiaoping said: "We 
should never ask Marx to provide ready answers to the questions 
arising 100 years or several hundred years after he died. 
Likewise, neither could Lenin bear the task of providing ready 
answers to the questions arising 50 or 100 years after he died." 
(Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 
291) "After the revolution succeeds, a country should build 
socialism according to its own conditions. There is no fixed 
pattern, and it is impossible to have one. Views sticking to 
conventions will only lead to backwardness and even failure." 
(Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 
292) This is to say that we should integrate the basic 
principle of Marxism with the reality of our own country and 
explore "our own road" in practice. 
  Second, it will not work to mechanically copy the pattern of 
other countries. Because "with a different foundation, 
different history, different environment, different neighbors, 
and many other differences, one country can learn from, but 
never mechanically copy the experiences of others. China 
suffered a lot from mechanically copying others' experiences. 
China can develop only Chinese socialism." (Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 265) 
  The above-mentioned two answers are the summary of our 
successful experiences and lessons of failure gained in our 
explorations on building socialism. For example, in the process 
of socialist transformation, our party did not rigidly adhere to 
Marxist books, nor did it mechanically copy the methods of other 
countries. Instead, it adopted the principles and policies 
compatible with China's conditions. Therefore, the socialist 
transformation was completed fairly smoothly and it promoted the 
development of productive forces and created successful 
experiences. Beginning in the late 1950's, however, the 
"leftist" erroneous ideology gained ground in the party. 
Instead of applying and developing theories in a creative 
manner in line with our national conditions and formulating the 
principles and policies compatible with reality, we were 
divorced from reality in judging China's conditions. We either 
mechanically copied what books said or mechanically copied the 
patterns of other countries, resulting in being overanxious for 
quick results, pursuit of absolute perfection, and such 
erroneous guiding thoughts, principles, and policies as "taking 
class struggle as the key link." Many things hindering the 
development of productive forces were regarded as "socialist 
principles" and adhered to, and many others compatible with 
reality and the masses' desires and helpful to the development 
of productive forces were regarded as the "tails of capitalism" 
and the "restoration of capitalism" and were opposed and 
criticized. As a result, we established an ownership structure 
that was too unitary, adhered for a long time to a highly 
centralized and rigid planned economy system and a political 
system whereby power was too centralized, and seriously fettered 
the development of productive forces. Such a situation 
developed into the "Great Cultural Revolution," which led the 
national economy to the brink of collapse. We should learn from 
this bitter lesson. 
  Third, because it is not realistic to follow the capitalist 
road in the path, and it also will not be realistic to do so in 
the future. China can only practice socialism. This is a major 
theoretical issue as well as a rigorous practical issue. Since 
reform and opening up, particularly during recent years, due to 
the rapid changes in the international situation, some major and 
minor events have also taken place in the country, making us 
more clear-headed and alert of this issue. 
  During the time when the ideological trend of bourgeois 
liberalization ran rampant, one erroneous viewpoint once emerged 
which believed that the capitalist stage should not be 
overstepped and that China should "go back to its old road." 
Going back to the old road means practicing "total 
westernization. This "theoretical" influence once made many 
comrades, some young people, in particular, have doubts in our 
systems. This viewpoint still has a certain market to this day. 
In view of this erroneous viewpoint, Comrade Xiaoping once 
talked about modern Chinese history on different occasions. He 
pointed out: Some people have raised such a question: Is it 
possible for the people of China to stand up and for China to 
turn over if it fails to practice socialism but follows the 
capitalist road? After more than 20 years of efforts of the 
Kuomintang, China had still remained a semi-colonial and semi- 
feudal society. This showed that it is impossible for China to 
have success if it follows the capitalist road. The one that 
changed the image of China is not the Kuomintang or the father 
and son of the Chiang's but the Chinese people led by the CPC 
and socialism. It is socialism that makes China marches toward 
unification and independence and ends a long period of a 
chaotic, poor and backward state. Here, Comrade Xiaoping used 
facts to show a true theory: In China where imperialism and the 
feudal influence are too strong and national bourgeoisie is too 
weak, it is absolutely unrealistic for it to follow the 
capitalist road; it is an inevitable choice for China to follow 
the socialist road during the development of its history. 
  In modern Chinese history, the "locally born and bred" 
bourgeoisie will not get anywhere and, after all, capitalism is 
only its dream. Then, will it be possible for the dreams of 
some people who have attempted to "introduce" the capitalist 
system of Western countries turn into reality today when 
socialism has experienced more than 40 years of trials and 
hardships? Will China's ship of socialism change its course in 
the fierce wind and waves of "peaceful evolution" and bourgeois 
liberalization? In face of these major questions of right and 
wrong, not all the people are clear-headed. Some people always 
think of using the prescription of the Western capitalist system 
to fundamentally cure the "disease of poverty" in China and 
believe that once they accept the capitalist systems, China will 
attain the highest level in one step and the pockets of all the 
people will be full. Certainly, this is a naive illusion. As 
Comrade Xiaoping has analyzed, China is a big country with a 
large population but a small county in economy. If it discards 
socialism in a single day, it will go back to the semi-colonial 
and semi-feudal society with a majority of poor people and a few 
rich people, and it will be impossible to attain the goal of 
becoming "well-off," and will have no guarantee for having 
enough food and clothing; if China discards socialism in a very 
short time, it will be unable to gain a foothold at all today 
when the strong capitalist countries have monopolized the 
international market, and it will be surely controlled by other 
people and become the appendage of the big Western countries, 
and will even be unable to maintain the current independent 
status. What it can do is to act in line with others' 
expressions and to live at the "mercy" of other people; if once 
China discards socialism and implements "democracy," "freedom," 
and "human rights" of the big Western countries, it will lose 
its political situation of stability and unity and even have 
civil wars which will not only bring harms to China but also 
bring disasters to the world. In short, if China practices 
capitalism, about one-fifth of the world population will have a 
major retrogression and there will be great disasters in 
history. This is a scene which each and every Chinese person 
with intuitive knowledge does not want to see as well as one 
which the people of foreign countries with insight do not want 
to see. This is absolutely not talking out of the void. The 
present situations of some countries have provided examples to 
prove this conclusion. 
  When adhering to "our own road," we do not rule out opening 
to the outside world. Just as Comrade Xiaoping said: "For 
socialism to win the advantages comparable to capitalism, we 
should bravely absorb and learn from the achievements in all the 
civilizations created by human societies and all the advanced 
operating forms and managerial methods, that reflect the law of 
modern socialized production, of all the countries in the 
present-day world, including developed capitalist countries." 
(Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 
373) Both history and reality show that to build the country, 
we should open to the outside world and never put ourselves in a 
closed or isolate position. A closed position will lead to 
nowhere. Opening to the outside world is an irreversible world 
trend, a prerequisite for "taking our own road," and a major 
characteristic of China's socialism. Without opening to the 
outside world, we cannot succeed in "taking our own road," and 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics will be out of 
the question. 
  To blaze our own road of development, the only correct 
method 
is "experimenting and blazing new trails bravely." It is a 
basic method for social practice in new historical conditions, a 
basic form of practicing the ideological line, and the only 
correct measure to seek integration between theory and practice. 
"Taking our own road" means, in fact, to blaze new trails in 
places where there are no roads. Without experiment and blazing 
new trails, the road can never by found. In the 15-year 
practice of reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping always asked 
us to "have greater courage in reform and opening up, experiment 
and blaze new trails bravely, and never be like women with bound 
feet. When we are sure of the worth of an endeavor, we should 
experiment with it and have a go at it boldly." (Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,, p 372) Comrade 
Xiaoping has always encouraged, respected, and wholeheartedly 
protected innovations. He regards "no argument" as his own 
"great creation." His purpose is not only to avoid dispersion 
of energy and to "race against time" but also to protect the 
spirit of innovation. Another of his noted viewpoint is to 
allow people to see, but they should experiment resolutely and 
lift control if it proves correct and should make correction if 
it proves wrong. His viewpoint of "experimenting and blazing 
new trails bravely" is aimed at facilitating reform and opening 
up and promoting economic development and is based on the 
political advantage of the socialist system. He has always 
reminded people to have greater courage because there will be no 
large risks, and the sky will not fall down. Even if there are 
some risks, problems will be solved fairly easily because we 
have the leadership of the communist party, have public 
ownership as the mainstay, and have power in our hands. 
  2. Why is it that the basic line and basic principles and 
policies should "not waver" and "not change?" 
  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
mentions on several occasions that the basic line and basic 
principles and policies should "not waver" and "not change." In 
my understanding, this is the most important "political 
instruction" of Comrade Xiaoping to the comrades of the entire 
party and will be the most important issue in practice our party 
and state will face in the coming decades. 
  We should adhere to the basic line without wavering for 100 
years because, first of all, this line has been formulated 
according to the basic national conditions in the initial stage 
of socialism and is also used to guide the social practice of 
the entire initial stage. The basic national conditions in the 
initial stage can be summarized as the following. 1) China's 
socialism has been built on a semi-feudal and semi-colonial 
basis, and the contradiction between the large population, the 
backward productive forces, and the ever growing material and 
cultural needs of the people on the one side and the backward 
social production on the other has become the major 
contradiction of society. 2) The political and economic systems 
of socialism are not yet mature and perfect. Many things 
between the superstructure and the economic foundation as well 
as between productive relations and productive forces do not 
suit each other. 3) The socialist system of the people's 
democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the communist 
party has been established, and the class struggle will persist 
to a certain extent for a long time. Owing to the 
aforementioned reality which will remain unchanged for a fairly 
long historic period, our party's basic political line can only 
be one of "one center and two basic points," and we adhere to it 
without wavering for the next 100 years. Meanwhile, the series 
of principles and policies formulated in line with the party's 
basic line to conform with the country's conditions should also 
be unswervingly and persistently upheld and remain unchanged. 
Else, our undertakings will end in failure. 
  The effort to adhere to the party's basic line without 
wavering for 100 years is related with our efforts to realize 
the three-step strategic objective. The period from the general 
completion of socialist transformation in the 1950's to the 
realization of the three-step strategic objective of having per 
capita GNP reach the levels of moderately developed countries 
and achieving socialist modernization overall in the middle of 
the next century, amounts to about 100 years. During the 
period, it is imperative to unswervingly uphold the center of 
economic construction and to follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
instructions, like, "persist in pursuit," "remain a bit stubborn 
in upholding the center," and "forcing ourselves to boost the 
economy". To this end, we must continuously deepen reform; 
broaden opening up; uphold the four cardinal principles; stick 
to the principle of building the two civilizations 
simultaneously; maintain social stability; and provide a 
powerful guarantee for economic construction. Only by ensuring 
the stability of one center and two basic points will we be 
certain in realizing the strategic target by the set date and to 
win one victory after another in socialist undertakings. 
  Not shaking our will in upholding the party's basic line in 
the 100 years represents the correct conclusion found out by our 
party from its bitter lessons and experiences. Just as Comrade 
Xiaoping pointed out: "The line adopted at the Eighth CPC 
Congress was correct. However, many correct opinions in the 
line adopted at the congress had not been persistently carried 
forward in practice because the party's ideological preparations 
at that time for building socialism in the country as a whole 
were insufficient". This finally led to such a tragedy as "the 
Great Cultural Revolution." "The reason why we had put forward 
a series of policies during the period from the end of 1970's to 
the beginning of 1980's was that we had summarized the 
experience and lesson gained in the `Great Cultural 
Revolution'." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, p 172) 
  Not shaking our will in upholding the party's basic line in 
the 100 years epitomizes the experience gained over the past 15 
years in the practice of reform and opening up. During the 
earth-shaking change effected in the 15 years, the economy has 
achieved fastest development; practical benefits enjoyed by the 
people have been most; and the international position of our 
country has been unprecedentedly upgraded. All of these 
represent the outcome scored in upholding the basic line as well 
as the basic principles and policies. Comrade Xioaping pointed 
out: "The basic line will be effective in the 100 years and 
never be shaken. Only by upholding the basic line can our party 
win the people's trust and support. People will not allow the 
attempt to bring about a change to the line, principles, and 
policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee,.... Without the achievements in reform 
and opening up, we would have been unable to pass the test 
presented by the "4 June" incident.... The reason why our 
country has been stable since the "4 June" incident is that we 
have promoted the economic development and improved the people's 
livelihood through the programs of conducting reform and opening 
up. Therefore, the armed forces and state officials should 
support the line, systems, and policies". He stressed 
continuously: "That our country has developed at such a rapid 
pace in as few as 10-odd years, which has delighted the 
country's people and attracted world attention, has fully proven 
the correctness of the line, principles, and policies laid down 
since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, and has proven that no one can change them even 
though he wants to change. These remarks can be summarized as: 
The adherence to the basic line, principles, and policies 
should remain unchanged." "It will be all right even though 
there are no new ideas. What we stress is that we should remain 
unchanged and should not let the people feel about the change in 
policies. With these line, principles, and policies, China will 
have hope." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, p 371) Comrade Xiaoping has used simple remarks 
to explain the following truth, that calls for our deep thought: 
A political line that can promote the development of productive 
forces is a correct line and is compatible with reality; a 
correct political line is not easily changed; if the line 
changes, history will go backwards, the state will experience 
internal disorder, and thus the people will not agree to the 
change; and whoever attempts to change them will be overthrown. 
  Why has Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the basic 
line, principles, and policies "cannot be wavered and changed?" 
In my opinion, on the one hand, the basic line, principles, and 
policies are truly very important to the future and destiny of a 
party, a state, and a nation; and, on the other hand, there are 
actually some people who disagree to persist in them. If we 
fail in this aspect, and, in particular, if we cannot clearly 
and correctly approach certain events taken place at home and 
abroad, then, it is not impossible for us to witness a waver in 
the party's basic line. Over recent years, it is precisely the 
correct attitude and measures, adopted by the second generation 
of leading collective, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core, 
and by the third generation of leading collective, with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core, for the series of major events taken 
place at home and abroad, that have ensured the implementation 
and execution of the party's basic line. For instance, the 
ideological train of bourgeois liberalization taken place in 
1987 was precisely a grave interference to our adherence to the 
basic line. The essence of this ideological train was to make 
China deviate from the socialist road. When we resisted this 
ideological train with a clear-cut stand, many people at home 
and abroad argued about whether China would change its set 
principles and policies. Comrade Xiaoping definitely pointed 
out: "Our set principles and policies will never change. Now 
that these principles and polices have been proven feasible in 
practice for eight years, why do we change them?" (Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 207) Then, he 
further pointed out: "The issue of "remaining unchanged" is an 
issue argued about by the people. And, I believe that this issue 
will be argued about until the end of this century and even the 
next century. We should use facts to prove this issue. (Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 218) For 
another instance, the political turbulence taken place in our 
country in 1989 and the sharp change in the international 
situation taken place right after the political turbulence posed 
the most rigorous trials on the party's basic line and policies 
regarding internal and external affairs. After reviewing this 
section of history, we can, through the study of Comrade 
Xiaoping's pertinent expositions, see that it is not our party 
that wants to change the basic line, principles, and policies, 
and our party has never changed them over the past dozen of 
years; and it is the "left" or "right" ideological train and the 
international hostile force that have forced us to give up these 
lines, principles, and policies. Therefore, in his speeches made 
during his south China tour, Comrade Xiaoping again stressed the 
necessity of guarding against the right and, what is more 
important, preventing the "left." So long as we persist in the 
basic line without wavering, we will be able to cope with 
multifarious changes by remaining unchanged and will be in an 
impregnable position forever. 
  In my understanding, Comrade Xiaoping's theory that the 
basic line and the basic principles and policies not waver or 
change is not only a serious "political instruction" but also an 
ardent expectation and earnest admonition for the generations to 
come. Comrade Xiaoping firmly believes that the general 
historical trend for socialism to replace capitalism will not 
regress or change. However, he also knows deeply that the road 
ahead of us will be tortuous and risky. He hopes that our party 
will become increasingly mature theoretically, that China's 
socialism will gradually become the "finalized system," and that 
our millions of people and the party's generation upon 
generation of leaders will have the political awareness in 
adhering to the basic line. As high-ranking cadres of the 
party, we deeply feel the heavy responsibility on our shoulders. 
Comrade Xiaoping said that "the key to whether the correct 
political line can be implemented lies in whether the 
ideological line is correct." This is because when the 
ideological line is correct, the theories compatible with 
China's reality and the basic guidelines and basic principles of 
the line will pass on from generation to generation and create 
endless material achievements in the integration process with 
practice. In addition, the principles and policies themselves 
will also be developed creatively and always maintain their 
robust vitality. 
  3. How Should We Understand the Endeavor of "Seizing the 
Opportunity To Accelerate Development" as Both an Economic Issue 
and a Political Issue? 
  In the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, development is a major topic of discussion 
which holds a central position. The core of the party's basic 
line is development, and the key to adhering to the basic line 
without wavering for 100 years is to persist in economic 
construction, the central task, without wavering. In Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, development 
is what is discussed most. Comrade Xiaoping's noted theses that 
"the basic task of socialism is developing productive forces" 
and that "development is the essential criterion" represent the 
most important theoretical innovation Marxist viewpoint of 
development. Also, in Comrade Xiaoping's theory on development, 
"seizing the opportunity to accelerate development and 
concentrating efforts to promote economic construction" is an 
important idea that can most embody China's characteristics, 
reflect the characteristics of this era, and represent the 
desires of the party and the people. For example, if we say 
that Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line have 
indicated and opened up the course of China's modernization 
drive, Comrade Xiaoping's brand-new theories on development, 
then, have hoisted the sails for the historical ship to advance 
more rapidly. 
  The development viewpoint of seizing the opportunity to 
accelerate development is one based on the ideological line of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This 
brand-new development viewpoint contains Comrade Xiaoping's 
intense sorrow over the historical experience of "suffering from 
a backwardness attack," his profound reflection over mistakes 
and setbacks, such as "taking class struggle as the key link" 
and "premature transition," his thorough understanding of the 
basic national situation characterized by "a large population 
and a poor foundation," his sober judgment of the international 
environment and climate China faces, and also his scientific 
foresight about the future of China and the world. 
  In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping and in many other of Comrade Xiaoping's works, the 
issue of the speed of China's development has been regarded as a 
serious political issue, and thus it is closely linked with the 
life or death of the party, the rise or decline of the country, 
and the future and destiny of the socialist system. Comrade 
Xiaoping maintained: China is faced with a rigorous challenge 
on this issue. We should effectively resist hegemonism, power 
politics, and "peaceful evolution." The key to always holding 
high the banner of socialism and maintaining the position of 
independence lies in accelerating economic development, whether 
we can achieve a relatively rapid growth rate, and whether we 
can fulfill our development strategy on schedule. After the 
sharp change in Eastern Europe, Comrade Xiaoping warned us in a 
timely manner: "Now, we should pay special attention to the 
landslide in the economic growth rate." He also sharply pointed 
out: "Whether we can avoid economic landslide and whether we 
can achieve the quadrupling task is a major question. This 
question may be one preventing us from being fast asleep for a 
long time, 10 years at least." (Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 355) 
  Comrade Xiaoping maintained: The rapid development of 
neighboring countries constitutes a challenge for us. In his 
speeches made during his south China trip, he pointed out: "The 
key to seize the opportunity to develop ourselves lies in 
developing the economy. The economic development of some 
neighboring countries and regions is now faster than our's. If 
we refuse to develop our economy or if we develop our economy 
too slowly, the people will catch sight of problems through 
comparison." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, p 375) From this, we can see that "slow growth 
means stop growing and even means going backwards." Comrade 
Xiaoping's sense of anxiety and urgency manifested in the issue 
of development has greatly educated us. 
  In Comrade Xiaoping's theory of development, the idea of 
seizing and making good use of the opportunity has been very 
prominent. The opportunity mentioned here means refers to a 
good international environment. At the moment, although various 
kinds of contradictions and conflicts have taken place 
continuously in the world and the world remains turbulent, peace 
and development are still the main trend of the times. The old 
polarization pattern has come to the end, and the world is 
developing toward multi-polarization. We can have a relatively 
long period of peaceful development. Moreover, Asia is 
relatively stable when compared with other areas in the world, 
and the economy in Asia is developing at a high speed. 
Relations between China and its neighboring countries have been 
relaxed and improved, therefore China has been provided an 
extremely favorable condition for opening its border areas to 
the outside world. Now, the worldwide new technology revolution 
is developing very fiercely, the international industrial 
structure is under reorganization, and a huge amount of surplus 
funds and advanced technologies need to seek new markets. All 
these have provided a historical opportunity for our 
development. With the farsightedness of a strategist, Comrade 
Xiaoping has repeatedly exhorted us: "There are not many such 
opportunities;" "the opportunity should be seized;" "on no 
account should this opportunity be missed;" "development should 
not be slowed down so long as it can be accelerated," "rapid 
development should not be hampered so long as it can be 
accelerated," and "the growth speed that can be achieved should 
be achieved as far as possible." In line with the experience on 
economic "leap" gained by China and some foreign countries in 
the past several years, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is 
essential for us to witness several stages during the long 
process of modernization in the future characterized by 
relatively rapid growth and relatively good efficiency." (Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 377) 
Then, Comrade Xiaoping again set forth the development idea and 
objective of "going all out to embark on a new stage every 
several years." In studying Comrade Xiaoping's expositions on 
accelerating development, we can feel about a force that presses 
us to forge ahead. This is a force produced by the ideological 
line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and 
is a force that encourages us to work hard. 
  While stressing the rate, Comrade Xiaoping always 
simultaneously emphasized such points as "paying attention to 
efficiency, quality and export-oriented items," and believed 
that as long as we have these three points, we will not be 
afraid of even a higher rate. On the issue concerning the 
relationship between "acceleration of development" and "steady 
development," Comrade Xiaoping has proposed a keen ideology, 
that is, "it is right to stress stability, however, 
overstressing it may make us lose the opportunity. ... Perhaps, 
our economic development law will advance in a wave upon wave 
manner and it will have a leap forward and will jump to a new 
stage after several years." (Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 368) We should not be surprised 
or alarmed at some disturbances in the course of economic 
development. This ideology has clearly explained the relations 
of dialectical unity between rate and efficiency, quickness and 
steadiness, and actually, it has also clearly explained the 
relationship between seeking truth from facts and emancipating 
the mind. This is the viewpoint of the dynamic theory of 
reflection which is in conformity with not only the objective 
law of economic development but it also stresses the factor of 
man's subjective dynamic role, having a practical and guiding 
significance in actual work. 
  How to realize a fairly high rate and to seek the 
integration 
of rate and efficiency? Comrade Xiaoping has always maintained 
that the fundamental way out is to conduct reform and opening up 
and to establish a new socialist market economic system. In his 
works, reform and opening up and acceleration of development are 
unseparated. Only by reforming the economic system, implementing 
opening up and breaking the old systems that shackle the 
development of the productive forces; using foreign advanced 
knowledge and experience for reference and adopting foreign 
advanced technology, can we be able to see a high rate and 
efficiency. At present, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee has issued the "decision on some issues 
concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic 
system," which makes our country's reform of the economic system 
more clear and specific. If we continue to follow this road, 
the reform pace will inevitably be greatly accelerated, and this 
will give rise to a tremendous motivation for economic 
development. We should strive to do a good job in reform. 
  To talk about development, it is also natural for us to talk 
about the affairs of our Inner Mongolia. As all people know, 
since its establishment more than 40 years ago, the Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region has witnessed rapid economic and 
social development and made tremendous achievements. Since 
reform and opening up, earth-shaking changes have taken place 
and a new situation of economic development, social stability, 
cultural invigoration and harmony among people of various 
nationalities has emerged. What is more gratifying is that we 
have gradually found a road to develop the economy and society. 
Being restricted by some conditions, we should not 
unrealistically emulate the rate of coastal and other developed 
areas or hope to catch up with the level of developed areas 
within a short time. However, we are determined to give play to 
the advantages of our region through reform, opening up and the 
arduous struggle of the people of various nationalities; to give 
full play to the advantages and favorable conditions of having 
"natural resources, good geographic conditions and policies," 
promote strong points and avoid shortcomings, strive to quicker 
the rate and raise efficiency, unceasingly shorten the gap with 
developed areas, and attain the goal of becoming well-off and 
prosperous. In 1987, in a speech on our country's nationalities 
policy and on the development of minority areas , Comrade 
Xiaoping particularly talked about the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region. He said: "In the case of Inner Mongolia, it has vast 
grasslands but a small population; it may probably march toward 
the front rank during its development in the future." 
"Observing the minority areas, we should mainly see whether 
they can be developed." "While approaching this issue, we should 
pay attention to the central point and not to its form." (Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 247) 
Comrade Xiaoping's remarks have given a profound lesson to our 
people of various nationalities. In this connection, Comrade 
Xiaoping has put forward his remark by regarding development as 
a core issue in the work undertaken by regions with the people 
of multiple nationalities. The "essence" pointed out by him 
means the issues of achieving development and making progress. 
We should deeply understand the important ideology of Comrade 
Xiaoping and earnestly summarize the work done over the past few 
years by regarding his ideology as a guidance. We should also 
further improve the guiding ideology, principles, and policies 
for work; bring all contributing factors into full play; unite 
with or lead the people of various nationalities to accelerate 
the economic and social development in the region; and realize 
the grand target of "being the advanced" put forward by Comrade 
Xiaoping through unswerving and protracted efforts. Party 
organizations and the people of various nationalities throughout 
the region possess their glorious tradition of uniting as one in 
struggles and waging arduous struggles and have a strong desire 
and confidence in "being the advanced". They will certainly be 
able to perform the miracles of latecomers surpassing the 
old-timers because they are facing the opportunity and many 
favorable conditions for accelerating the development. 
4. In Upholding the Ideological Line, What Consciousness and 
Morals Should Leaders Have? 
  Emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts represent a 
scientific proposition full with dialectical and historical 
materialism and concentratedly reflect the world outlook and 
methodology of the proletarian class. It is uneasy for us to 
understand the ideological line and even uneasy for us to 
conduct practice on it. Whether the ideological line has been 
unswervingly upheld represents a practical yardstick in 
measuring the level and consciousness of every leading 
personnel. It not only can give a test to our capabilities of 
understanding and of handling problems and particularly to our 
party spirit, work style, and morals. 
  Unswervingly upholding the line of emancipating minds and 
seeking truth from facts requires a scientific attitude and the 
spirit of dealing with matters relating to work. First of all 
we should honestly do things in line with the objective law of 
development. This requires us to frequently go deep into 
reality, to keep extensive contacts with the masses, to 
understand at all times the changes of objective conditions, to 
realistically and accurately know the masses' ideological trend, 
and to seize the turning point of the age so as to enable our 
policies to conform with the reality. In this connection, the 
bureaucracy losing contact with reality should be resolutely 
overcome. The attitude and method of paying lip service and 
considering oneself in the right should be resolutely cast away. 
Efforts should be made to be the honest persons often praised 
by Chairman Mao. In view of Chairman Mao, Marx, Lenin, and 
scientists are honest people who are doing things honestly 
according to a scientific attitude. Comrade Xiaoping is just an 
honest person of such a kind, always advocates the spirit of 
doing matters relating to work, and always sets himself an 
example in work. His works and speeches are in simple styles 
and have no empty talks losing contact with reality. His 
practice scored over the past several decades even represents 
the glorious example and vivid teaching materials of displaying 
the spirit of doing matters relating to work. 
  There is a bad practice at present, in which some leading 
personnel have often adopted an attitude of undiscriminatingly 
copying and relaying the higher authorities' directives and the 
experience gained by outside places. After accepting the 
documents, they have often got through with only relaying them 
any old way and few of them are to earnestly study them; to 
conduct earnest discussion; and to take an earnest consideration 
about them. They never ask "whys" and "hows" relating to the 
documents and never put forward their opinions on implementing 
the documents in line with the local reality. They often 
perform their duties in a perfunctory manner by only relaying 
these documents to their subordinate units. Among those who have 
adopted such an irresponsible attitude, hundred percent of them 
will suffer a failure. Since the programs of conducting reform 
and opening up, many localities have brought about tremendous 
changes to their economic and social outlooks. Some of them 
have even improved their economic and social outlooks to a new 
level within two or three years. The witness of such a progress 
has inspired the people very much. However, some localities 
have brought about slight changes in this regard and some of 
them have not accurately found out their ways of developing 
their local economy as of now. They are only repeating some 
formalist slogans. Such an irresponsible attitude adopted by the 
leading personnel in these localities represents the 
manifestations of their weak party spirit and professional 
ambition. If we leave this attitude unchecked, these localities 
will have no future. 
  In specific work, it is, of course, important to put 
forward the policies compatible with reality. However, it is 
more important to turn the correct policies into actions through 
everyone's earnest efforts in doing solid work. Without this, 
no policies, however perfect, can be turned into material 
achievements. Making earnest efforts to do solid work is not 
only a work style and the basic method to implement policies but 
also a test on the party spirit and sense of responsibility of 
every leader. Comrade Xiaoping has always advocated earnest 
efforts and solid work. Over the past few years, he has urged 
us on many occasions to "devote some time to more solid work and 
speak less," to "accomplish some work in a down-to-earth manner 
and score real achievements to win trust of the people," to 
"concentrate on doing some work with which the masses are 
satisfied and pleased," and to "work hard to make our own work 
successful." He has particularly emphasized: "Leaders must do 
more solid work. They must change the bad work styles of 
spending the day by giving orders and empty talks." (Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 121) 
Comrade Xiaoping's instruction and example are the force to 
spur us on to work in a down-to-earth manner. 
  Another very important issue concerning the need for leaders 
to adopt a scientific approach of seeking truth from facts is 
that they should learn to analyze and address problems in a 
dialectical manner and not from a lopsided viewpoint or in terms 
of absolutes. This is not only a theoretical issue but also an 
issue on practice that leaders will often encounter during 
leadership work. To those assuming higher-level leadership 
work, this issue is more important. For example, the party's 
basic line clearly consists of "two basic points," but some 
leaders see only one; and the "two basic points" constitute an 
organic whole, but some leaders separate them and even set one 
against the other. The reason why there are "leftist" and 
rightist ideological interference within the party and why the 
party is "strong in one task and weak in the other" is closely 
related to the lopsided way of thinking in addition to some 
factors. Another example, Comrade Xiaoping has a very important 
thinking, namely to take the overall situation into account, 
subject to the overall situation, and consider issues from the 
angle of the overall situation. Here, the overall situation 
means the "large reality," and the partial situation is merely 
the "small reality." Proceeding from the overall situation 
means proceeding from the large reality. Concerning the issue on 
"fools [sha zi 0247 1311] and melons [gua zi 3900 1311]," he 
looked back and said: "Many people felt uneasy at that time, 
saying that he had earned 1 million yuan and should be 
criticized. I said no, because when we criticize him, people 
would think that policies have changed. Then, the loss will 
outweigh the gain. Issues like this are still many. If we fail 
to handle them properly, our principles will be shaken easily, 
and the overall situation of reform will be affected." (Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 371) In 
Comrade Xiaoping's opinion, leaving the issues on "fools and 
melons" unresolved does not affect the overall situation; and 
solving them would be harmful to the overall situation. When 
faced with major issues and important junctures, Comrade 
Xiaoping has always been so clear-headed and so profound, 
comprehensive, and sharp in analyzing issues; and when solving 
problems, he has always solved them properly in order of 
importance and urgency. This cannot be achieved without well 
versed dialectical thinking and the foresight and strategy of a 
strategist. We should learn from Comrade Xiaoping's thinking and 
practice and learn to use materialist dialectics to think over 
and handle issues. Many things in reality show that when 
leaders' way of thinking is wrong, they will be confused about 
the cardinal issues of right and wrong an even commit political 
mistakes to cause irretrievable losses to our cause. 
  We must have the spirit of blazing new trails and the 
awareness of taking risks in order to unswervingly persist in 
the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth 
from facts. Modern leaders must have this kind of spirit and 
awareness. The theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the most creative. The ideological line of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts involves 
ceaselessly blazing new trails. Our country's achievements in 
reform and modernization made over the past 10 years or so are 
just the achievements made by hundreds of millions of the people 
who have made ceaseless efforts to blaze new trails and 
vigorously keep forging ahead under the guidance of the party. 
Nothing will be accomplished and no progress will be made 
without this spirit. Comrade Xiaoping has the following 
heartening words: "Without the spirit of blazing new trails, 
the spirit of `taking risks,' or vitality, we cannot pioneer a 
good and new way or accomplish new undertakings. Who has the 
daring to declare that he does not take any risks and has 
certainty of success in doing anything." (Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 372) What Comrade 
Xiaoping advocates here is just the spirit of blazing new trails 
and the awareness of taking risks. The "vitality" that he 
talked about is revolutionary courage, heroism, and momentum. 
It is from the lofty ideals and the boundless faithfulness to 
the people. The spirit of blazing new trails and taking risks in 
the course of reform and opening up is extremely precious and 
merits vigorous carriage forward. Those who are very lazy, 
accomplish nothing, and lack the sense of responsibility cannot 
do this, neither can those who strive to avoid contributions and 
only make mistakes. Those who do not keep the people and 
undertakings in mind but only seek benefits for themselves and 
their small groups can not only accomplish nothing but also not 
understand the spirit of blazing new trails and the awareness of 
taking risks. They even criticize and vilify the comrades with 
this kind of spirit. 
  The ideological line of the party is a truly materialist 
line. So, only true materialists can completely understand and 
unswervingly persist in it. Because we must take risks, pay 
prices, and make sacrifice to persist in this line. Those 
without the sense of responsibility for the wealth and happiness 
of the people or enthusiasm for undertakings, like a raging 
fire, are unwilling to pay this price. For instance, many 
things in our practical life should be done by the leaders with 
the daring to persistently seek truth from facts. For instance, 
the masses have complaints about the unhealthy trends, the 
corrosive phenomena, and the indicators for political liberalism 
that seriously exist within the party; and it is difficult to 
correct them. One of the important reasons is that some leading 
comrades lack the daring to seek truth from facts and to persist 
in truth, are afraid of offending others, and are not willing to 
take risks by themselves. These comrades do not understand that 
the party must pay big prices if they are not willing to pay 
small prices. As long as justice prevails, evil trends will be 
overwhelmed. Truth and justice are, after all, not befuddled. 
What will we be afraid of? Another example is that some of our 
leaders often come across the situation of having two completely 
different viewpoints and assessments on the same thing, the same 
person, the same section of history, and the same locality. All 
of them think that they are seeking truth from facts. There are 
many factors to these problems. There may be problems in 
ability and level; there may be problems in the degree of 
understanding of circumstances and in the angle of approaching 
issues; and there may also be problems of having different ideas 
and standards for what is right and wrong. Such a situation is 
understandable. What is important is that leaders of various 
localities and units must take the position of upholding party 
spirit and the basic point of seeking truth from facts to speak 
and act impartially, to correct the prejudices of some comrades, 
and to encourage the cadres who persist in seeking truth from 
facts. 
  The basic point of the party's ideological line is that the 
people's interest is higher than everything else. The source of 
the courage and the strength to persist in this ideological line 
is among the people. Over the scores of years, Comrade Xiaoping 
has considered himself the "son of Chinese people," always 
respected the masses and loved the people, always borne in mind 
the people's interest and aspirations, and regarded "whether the 
people support it," "whether the people agree to it," "whether 
the people are happy," and "whether the people cooperate" as the 
starting point and ending point to formulating all principles 
and policies and as the fundamental criterion to judge right 
from wrong. Precisely for this reason, Comrade Xiaoping has had 
tremendous courage in theory and practice; his correct policy 
decisions have naturally become the conscious actions of 
hundreds of millions of people; and he himself has been able to 
undauntedly lead the people to continuously charge forward 
during the great process of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Comrade Xiaoping has undergone a rough life 
characterized by "three ups and three downs," and his 
revolutionary character of steadfastly persisting in truth and 
principles regardless of his personal honor or disgrace, his 
personal feelings of gratitude or resentment, and his personal 
gains or losses has truly manifested his lofty awareness of 
steadfastly seeking truth from facts. The great experience of 
Comrade Xiaoping has taught and inspired us a lot. Dauntless 
are the Communists who consider the people's interest higher as 
being more important than everything else, and no personal costs 
should waver Communists' steadfastness in persisting in the 
party's ideological line. 
  In his memorial article for Comrade Liu Bocheng, Comrade 
Xiaoping stated: "He bent his back and was willing to risk any 
danger to realize his beliefs. At any time and any place, in 
smooth or adverse circumstance, and no matter how objective the 
environment changes, he has always contributed and submitted his 
all to the party and has merged himself with the party's cause 
regardless of his personal honor or disgrace, thus truly 
attaining the state of forgetting himself." (Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp 188-189) How 
much we are educated and spurred on by these remarks of Comrade 
Xiaoping! If all generations of our leaders can attain such a 
"oblivious state," all levels of the party's leading bodies will 
become strong headquarters of fighting, will be able to foster a 
very good atmosphere, and will be able to steadfastly persist in 
the ideological line of seeking truth from facts. So, the ship 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will never 
deviate from the correct course amid terrifying waves and will 
always sail towards glorious destinations.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The 211 project, an 
ambitious national education reform project, has sparked a wave 
of quicker development through bolder reforms among the higher 
education institutions in this coastal city of north China. 
  The 211 project, pinpointing the spirit with which the 
country's education must face the 21st century, spells out the 
build-up of 100 key higher education institutions and key 
specialist subject centers throughout the country in some ten 
years. Hence the figure 211. 
  Authorities said the project is a strategic educational 
reform move for China designed to get the country's universities 
and colleges soundly prepared for the upcoming challenges in the 
next century so as to well serve the country's accelerated 
modernization drive. 
  The project aims to help the 100 universities and scientific 
centers, to be selected in stages over the next ten or more 
years, train more world-class professionals faster and, 
meanwhile, raise their academic level to above the national 
average and close to that of the world. Universities and 
colleges nationwide have been responding to the project. They 
will be granted special government funds and preferential 
treatment once chosen to be among the 100. 
  The 30 Tianjin-based institutions of higher learning are 
making all-out efforts to reform their educational structure and 
upgrade their academic levels in a bid to get into the group of 
the chosen 100. 
  Li Guangquan, president of Tianjin University, said the 211 
project is a precious development opportunity as well as a tough 
challenge for his university. He said his university is a 
strong and hopeful contender but improvements are still wanted 
in one way or another. 
  Du Buying, president of the Tianjin Institute of Finance and 
Economics, said his institute has readjusted development 
strategy so as to be more competitive. 
  All the other universities in the city have been 
concentrating on building up their teaching staff and improving 
their campus environment as well as on raising academic levels. 
  Some universities and colleges in the city have merged to 
improve their competitive edge. 
  Education officials said that though there will be only 100 
chosen universities and institutions across the country, the 211 
project will turn out to be a golden chance both for those 
selected and those not selected to push their education and 
management to a higher level.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the municipal conference of foreign 
economic and trade departments was held in Jinghai County. The 
conference relayed and implemented the guidelines of the second 
enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, 
discussed and made arrangements for this year's foreign economic 
and trade work priorities, and defined the specific work 
objectives. Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, made a special trip from Beijing to Tianjin to 
attend the conference. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal 
party committee, and Vice Mayor Ye Disheng attended and 
addressed the conference. 
  This year, the municipal agreements on the direct use of 
foreign capital should involve a total investment of $5 billion, 
up 42.1 percent over last year. We should guarantee that the 
total volume of foreign export trade will reach $2.2 billion, 
and should strive to realize $2.3 billion, an increase of 19.8 
percent and 27.6 percent, respectively, over last year. [passage 
omitted] 
  On behalf of the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, thanked the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation for its support and correct guidance; and extended 
congratulations to the municipal foreign economic and trade 
departments on their achievements gained last year. He pointed 
out: Foreign economic and trade work affects the overall 
situation and plays an extremely important role in accelerating 
Tianjin's economic development. Last year, the municipality 
made great achievements in its foreign economic and trade work, 
and this year its tasks will be more arduous. Foreign economic 
and trade departments should emancipate the mind, expand the 
degree of reform, make earnest efforts to do practical work, 
grasp the work firmly, and enable foreign economic and trade 
work to enter a new and big stage. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: To fulfill this year's foreign 
economic and trade work, we must proceed from deepening the 
internal reform of enterprises; unceasingly improve the 
investment environment, and turn the foreign economic and trade 
departments into examples in improving Tianjin's investment 
environment; mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors, do a good 
job in building the party, leading bodies, and contingents, and 
raise the entire quality of foreign economic and trade 
departments to meet the needs of the new period and new 
situation. 
  In his speech, Vice Mayor Ye Disheng called on foreign 
economic and trade departments to do their work in line with the 
objective of attaining a higher level. He said: This year the 
targets of all items of work must not be lower than last year's 
level, and in general, should surpass last year's level, and 
enter a new stage. In carrying out foreign economic and trade 
work, we should stand on the van of Tianjin's big decisive 
battle and big change, seize the opportunity to accelerate 
development, and produce a satisfactory answer to the 9.1 
million people of Tianjin at the end of the year.

  [Text] This morning, the provincial bureau and the 
provincial financial department jointly held a provincial grain 
work conference to comprehensively implement the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government's measures on 
accelerating reform of the grain circulation system and to 
clearly define this year's provincial grain work objective. 
  Our province reaped a bumper grain harvest in 1993. The 
total 
output of grain and soybean totaled 23 billion kg, the best 
record in history. As of 20 January this year, we had laid up 
3.165 billion kg of grain under state contract purchase, 
fulfilling 79.9 percent of the contract purchasing task. The 
annual grain purchase totaled 5.05 billion kg, surpassing the 
plan by 26 percent. 
  The provincial grain departments have resolutely proceeded 
from the provincial conditions and grain conditions, reformed 
the grain purchasing and marketing system, and on the basis of 
the previous year's reduction of grain purchasing quota and 
decontrol of grain marketing work, implemented the system of 
stabilizing the grain purchasing quota and decontrolling the 
marketing of grain, continued to decontrol grain management and 
grain prices, effectively alleviated the difficulties of 
peasants in selling grain, and guaranteed the stability and 
vitality of urban and rural grain and cereal oil markets. 
Forty-two prefectures, cities and counties across the province 
have established grain markets and put them into operation. We 
have initially formed a grain system with provincial grain 
wholesale markets as the head, regional markets as the backbone, 
and city and county primary markets as the basis, and succeeded 
in reducing deficits and increasing profits. 
  In grain work, this year our province should further deepen 
the grain purchasing and marketing system; the annual grain 
purchase should be 7.5 billion kg, and the marketing of grain 
should be 6 billion kg. Beginning from the time when new grains 
are put on the market, we should implement the method of 
guaranteeing the amount of grain under state contract purchase 
and decontrol its prices and allowing the province to retain 460 
million kg of grain under contract purchase, and after the 
implementation of this method, relatively abolish the cash 
deposit for the contract purchase of soybean and the coefficient 
of guaranteeing the amount of grain purchase. The grain 
purchasing prices will be adjusted according to market demands, 
and the system of protective prices will be implemented. While 
doing a good job in grain marketing, all localities should also 
pay attention to grain export. Beginning this year, in the 
export of state grain, we will change the system of delivering 
grain at government fixed prices into the system of exporting 
grain through agents at negotiation prices. At present, special 
efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of export grain 
to Japan, open up the channel of exporting rice, and expand the 
quota of grain export during border trade. Meanwhile, we should 
actively promote reform of the property right system, copy the 
work methods of Mudanjiang city grain bureau and Bayan County 
grain bureau, and do a good job in reform of the enterprise 
shareholding system. 
  This year we should guarantee that the deficits of the grain 
departments will not exceed the contract quota of 730 million 
yuan, and that no new deficits or default in payments will 
occur. During the Spring Festival, we should make proper 
arrangements for the grain, cereal oil, and salt markets in an 
all-round manner, persist in selling products according to the 
price tags, and realistically organize the living of people in 
the disaster areas.

  [Text] Harbin, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The private sector of 
the economy is playing an increasingly important role in 
northern Heilongjiang's Daqing city, one of the most important 
petroleum and chemical industrial centers in China, according to 
the city government. 
  Statistics show that the city's individual households 
involved in the private economy numbered 42,000 by the end of 
1992, with a total registered capital of 440 million yuan, up 71 
and 66 percent from the previous year's figures. 
  The city government has implemented more than 20 
preferential 
policies for the expansion of the private economy to cope with 
establishing the socialist market economy in the country, said 
Qian Dihua, mayor of Daqing. 
  The policies include the widening of private business 
coverage and the reduction of taxes for self-employed workers. 
  The city government has worked hard to promote its private 
economy by learning from the experience of Chinese coastal 
cities in line with its own conditions, the mayor said. 
  Private manufacturers are engaged in the deep processing of 
petroleum and chemical products, making use of Daqing's abundant 
resources. 
  They produce necessary accessories for petroleum production 
equipment. Using leftover bits and pieces of materials of a 
chemical factory, more than 100 households in the city's datong 
district make plastic fiber bags. The bags, costing half the 
price demanded by similar products, sell well both in and 
outside of the city. 
  Shi Fuxiang, a self-employed worker, set up a glass fiber 
factory with an investment of more than one million yuan. The 
factory uses leftover bits and pieces of glass to produce glass 
cloth, which is used to wrap oil pipelines. 
  The factory turns out more than 1,000 meters of glass cloth 
a 
day. 
  The city government is now improving its market system to 
further promote its private economic sector.

province. He Zhukang added: Trained personnel are important. 
We should create a good environment and good conditions for the 
development of trained personnel. Training and educating people 
is a very important task with a far-reaching significance. We 
should not neglect the influence of negative factors on young 
people, nor should we underestimate the influence of Western 
culture. We should exert concerted efforts and give correct 
guidance to enable theories, literature, and art to make 
contributions to our endeavor of building a developed border 
province near the sea.

  [Text] The six units, including the organizational, 
propaganda, united front work, and personnel affairs departments 
under the provincial party committee; as well as the provincial 
science and technology commission and association, jointly 
sponsored a tea party for intellectuals on the occasion of the 
1994 Spring Festival on 26 January. 
  Attending the party were provincial leading personnel, 
including Gu Jinchi, Quan Shuren, Shang Wen, Xu Wencai, Wen 
Shizhen, Yu Junbo, Feng Yousong, Xu Tingsheng, Zhang Rongming, 
and Zhang Chenglun; provincial veteran leaders, including Xu 
Shaofu, Wang Guangzhong, Ge Xifan, Liu Yiyun, Zhang Yan, and 
Shen Xianhui; as well as more than 80 representatives of 
intellectuals. 
  During the party Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial 
party 
committee, delivered a speech in which on behalf of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial people's 
government he first extended heartfelt regards and lofty respect 
to specialists, scholars, and intellectuals working on various 
fronts and in various fields. Gu Jinchi said: The broad masses 
of intellectuals are forces relied upon by our country in 
conducting socialist undertakings and also the important forces 
of conducting reform, opening up, and economic construction. He 
urged the broad masses of intellectuals to bring their 
enthusiasm and creativeness into full play, to turn as soon as 
possible the scientific and technological results into practical 
productive forces, and to make more contributions to 
accomplishing the second-phase pioneering work. He also urged 
party committees and governments at all levels to continuously 
and correctly implement in an overall way the policy on 
intellectuals by grasping the central tasks of respecting 
knowledge and talented personnel. They should often listen to 
the opinions, suggestions, and voices raised by the broad masses 
of intellectuals and bring into full play their important 
advisory role in making scientific policy decisions and in 
participating in or discussing governmental and political 
affairs. The departments of organizations, propaganda, 
personnel affairs, and united front work; as well as science and 
technology commission and association should realistically 
assume their own responsibility and make concerted efforts to 
intensively encourage the society as a whole to support the work 
on intellectuals' affairs and to vigorously create a new 
situation in the work in this regard.

  [Text] Shenyang, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province, a major heavy industrial base, has abolished 
its 40-year-old practice of imposing mandatory production 
targets on industrial enterprises, according to an announcement 
here today. 
  In the early years of the founding of the People's Republic 
of China the government designated 156 key construction 
projects, 24 of them in Liaoning. 
  At one time 80 percent of the province's industrial 
production was decided by state mandatory plans. 
  But since 1985 the province has gradually cut the portion of 
mandatory industrial production, along with the rapid progress 
of the reform and opening drive nationwide, especially the 
adoption of a market economy. 
  The industrial production based on mandatory plan was cut to 
36 percent in 1992, and further down to 12 percent last year. 
  With the abolition of the mandatory plan for industrial 
production, the provincial government has to adjust its function 
from issuing orders to providing services for industrial 
enterprises. 
  By studying industrial policies and market changes, the 
government has strengthened macroeconomic control over 
industrial enterprises. 
  This measure is aimed at pushing enterprises onto the 
market. 
  This may bring about some difficulties for some of them, but 
the majority welcome the new move, according to officials with 
the provincial planning committee.

  [Text] Shenyang January 28 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province, the largest industrial center in China, has 
made big progress over the past year in transforming its old 
enterprises, according to the provincial Economic Committee. 
  An official from the committee said that the province 
transformed more than 3,000 old enterprises last year, among 
which 365 were large and medium-sized ones, about one third of 
the province's major enterprises. 
  Liaoning, one of China's most important industrial bases 
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, 
has turned over to the state more than 170 billion yuan in taxes 
over the last four decades. 
  But recent years have shown that Liaoning's enterprises have 
failed to meet the country's accelerated modernization drive, as 
they are plagued by problems of aging equipment and outdated 
technologies. 
  Statistics show that by the 1990s only 32.5 percent of the 
equipment installed in the province's enterprises reached the 
1980s standard, lower than the national average and about 20 
percentage points lower than some of the country's prosperous 
provinces. 
  Cao Guixin, director of the committee, said that Liaoning 
has 
launched a campaign to import foreign capital and technologies 
to help transform the aged enterprises. 
  Last year alone more than 100 large and medium-sized 
enterprises were reformed with foreign funds. In Dalian, a 
major port city of the province, 11 machinery and chemical 
enterprises and 17 electronics enterprises were successfully 
updated, the official said. 
  He also said that in 1993 Liaoning sponsored several large 
economic and trade fairs overseas, through which the province 
established direct relations with many foreign financial groups 
and large companies. 
  According to statistics, Liaoning has invested 5.69 billion 
U.S. dollars in transforming old enterprises, including 2.19 
billion U.S. dollars in foreign capital. 
  Cao said that co-operation with other countries and regions 
in the transformation drive has eased the money shortages which 
have plagued these enterprises for decades as well as introduced 
advanced foreign management into the old enterprises. 
  The official assured that this year Liaoning will upgrade 
its 
backbone industries, major products and key enterprises through 
utilizing more overseas high-technology and capital.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- China will spare no 
efforts to increase its exports this year for the balanced 
development of its foreign trade, Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] Wu Yi said here today. 
  She said that to strike a rough balance between exports and 
imports is China's basic principle in foreign trade and economic 
co- operation, and it intends to realize the balance through 
expanding exports rather than reducing imports. 
  Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Press Office 
under the State Council that China's foreign trade and economic 
cooperation continued to maintain a strong growth momentum last 
year on the basis of its rapid development over the past few 
years. 
  The foreign trade volume last year reached 195.72 billion 
U.S. dollars-worth, an increase of 18.2 million U.S. dollars 
over 1992. 
  Exports were worth 91.77 billion U.S. dollars and imports 
were worth 103.95 billion U.S. dollars. Thus the increase of 
imports was 21 percent higher than that of exports, leaving a 
deficit of 12.18 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Wu attributed the slow growth of exports to the high-speed 
growth of the domestic economy, large scaled investment, robust 
demand, price increases and lack of supply of some commodities, 
especially primary products. 
  Meanwhile, she said, imports of raw materials, energy and 
equipment needed for economic development increased rapidly. 
  Statistics show that last year imported commodities, whose 
import volume exceeding one billion U.S. dollars include 
aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished oil, 
fertilizers, industrial chemicals and complete sets of equipment. 
  Wu said that this indicates once again that China is a large 
market with great potential.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The number of 
foreign- funded projects China approved, and the related 
contracted value, last year are almost equal to the total 
amounts for the previous 14 years since the beginning of China's 
reform and opening-up drive, a high-ranking trade official said 
here today. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation [MOFTEC], told a press conference that last year 
China approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, with a total 
contractual value standing at 110.852 billion U.S. dollars. The 
actual amount of foreign investment used in the period was 
25.759 billion U.S. dollars. The figures were 70 percent, 90 
percent and 134 percent, respectively, more than in 1992. 
  By the end of last year, Wu said, China had accumulatively 
approved over 174,000 foreign-funded projects with the pledged 
and actually used foreign investment topping 217.216 billion and 
over 60 billion U.S. dollars, respectively. 
  According to Wu, the investment came from more than 100 
countries and areas, and Hong Kong, Macao, Japan and the United 
States were among major sources. 
  Although the lion's share of the foreign investment still 
flowed to coastal areas, the growth rate of foreign investment 
in land- locked regions last year surpassed that in coastal 
areas. 
  The investment was concentrated in such fields as energy, 
light industry, electronics, machinery, textiles, garments, 
metallurgy, building materials and real estate. 
  Wu said that one of the outstanding characteristics of the 
foreign investment in China last year was that many 
multinational corporations have come to invest in China, and the 
scope of investment and the scale of projects have expanded 
continuously. 
  Last year, Wu said, the average contracted foreign 
investment 
per foreign-funded project reached 1.33 million U.S. dollars, an 
increase of 12.9 percent over the previous year. 
  She said that the volume of exports and imports from 
foreign- 
funded enterprises stood at 67 billion U.S. dollars-worth, 
accounting for over one third of the nation's total, with 
exports at 25.24 billion-worth and imports at 41.83 billion U.S. 
dollars-worth, increases of 45.4 percent and 58.5 percent over 
1992, respectively. 
  After deducting costs of equipment imports employed as 
investment, imports by foreign-funded enterprises stood at 25.2 
billion U.S. dollars-worth, thus exports and imports were 
roughly balanced, she said. 
  Moreover, Wu added, in the first 11 months of last year 
foreign exchange sold and brought in by foreign-invested 
companies reached 8.72 billion and 3.56 billion U.S. dollars, 
respectively, with the net amount of foreign exchange taken out 
reaching 5.16 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Meanwhile, China signed loan agreements with foreign 
governments for 2.01 billion U.S. dollars, and the actual amount 
it used was 2.89 billion U.S. dollars, 11.2 percent more than in 
1992.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (MOFTEC), 
said here today that by the end of last year China had set up 
4,497 enterprises abroad with a total investment of 5.16 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  At a press conference held by the Press Office under the 
State Council, Wu said Chinese overseas investments have spread 
over more than 120 countries and regions. 
  Among them, 2,927 are trade-related enterprises, and 
non-trade enterprises number 1,570. 
  Wu said that 380 overseas enterprises were approved by or 
registered with MOFTEC last year. The volume of the contracted 
investment was 210 million U.S. dollars, of which Chinese 
investment was 120 million U.S. dollars, occupying 56 percent of 
total contracted investment volume. 
  It is learned that Chinese overseas investment involves not 
only imports and exports but the non-trade fields of resource 
development, processing, production, assembly, contracted 
projects, communications and transportation, finance and 
insurance, medical and health ventures, consultancy service, and 
hotels and restaurants.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The level of 
China's protection for intellectual property rights has 
surpassed the general level in the world, said Wu Yi, minister 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation. 
  Wu told a press conference held here today by the 
Information 
Office of the State Council that on January 16, 1992, China 
reached a memorandum of understanding on the issue of 
intellectual property rights protection with the United States. 
China has kept its words in the memorandum thoroughly, which 
the U.S. side also admitted. 
  Till now, the Law on Trademarks, the Patent Law, and the Law 
on Copyright have been passed in China, and its Law on 
Trademarks conforms to the Paris Convention for the protection 
of industrial property, of which China is the 95th member 
country. 
  Since China signed the Madrid agreement for the 
international 
registration of trademarks, about ten thousand foreign 
trademarks have been protected in China. 
  Moreover, China has also signed the Berne Convention for the 
protection of literary and artistic works, and the universal 
copyright convention. 
  When answering a question about the U.S. view that the 
status 
of China's intellectual property rights protection posed another 
obstacle to America-Chinese ties, Wu said that the U.S. 
Government neither knows nor understands China's positive 
practice in this regard. 
  She added that it is not wise to try to impose pressure. 
  Having a vast territory and large population, China 
developed 
unevenly in different regions on the issue, Wu admitted. 
  But she added that China will start a comprehensive 
education 
drive to strengthen its people's sense of intellectual property 
rights protection, since all countries, including China, are in 
need of protection of intellectual property rights. 
  Wu said that China will open courts for intellectual 
property 
rights in some key cities. If evidence of violation of 
intellectual property rights were found, both Chinese and 
foreigners could sent the cases to court.

Dajun (7115 1129 6874): "What New Breakthroughs and Progress 
Has the `Decision' Made? -- An Interview With Noted Economist 
Liu Guoguang"] 
  [Text] In line with the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important talks, the 14th CPC National Congress set the reform 
goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure. 
This is truly a breakthrough development in Marxist economics. 
What new situations has the "Decision on Matters Relating to 
the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," 
which was adopted on this basis by the newly held Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, provided us and what 
breakthroughs and advances has the Decision made? We asked Liu 
Guoguang, an noted economist who participated in the drafting of 
the Decision to talk about his views on the question. 
  He said: The Decision is the concrete, programmatic, and 
systematic embodiment of the goal of market economy set by the 
14th CPC National Congress. This basic framework or general 
plan, which the Decision sketched, is in itself a breakthrough 
and progress. 
  The basic framework or general plan has rich contents, of 
which some are innovative advances. Let us just cite the major 
ones. They are as follows: 
<H3>  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System and Genuinely 
Energizing the Main Subjects of the Market </H3>
  Reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises has 
always been the focus of economic structural reform. 
Enterprises are the main subject of the market, and large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the lead of the main 
subjects. If state-owned enterprises are not invigorated, it 
will be difficult to stimulate the market as a whole. 
  Reviewing past events, Liu Guoguang said: In the past few 
decades we have introduced various reforms for enterprises, such 
as delegating power to enterprises, changing from profit 
delivery to tax payment, and practicing a contract system. 
Overall, state-owned enterprises have become more energetic 
than in the initial stage of reform. Nevertheless, the previous 
reforms have not touched the enterprise system under the planned 
economic structure. Thus, the problems, such as that no 
distinction was made between the functions of the government and 
those of the enterprises, property rights were confused, and 
everybody ate from the same big pot, have not yet been genuinely 
resolved. Moreover, the burdens shouldered by enterprises are 
very heavy and they could not free themselves from running 
society. Therefore, compared with nonstate-owned enterprises, 
most state-owned enterprises apparently lack vitality. 
According to reports from departments concerned, one-third of 
large and medium- sized state-owned enterprises incurred losses 
in operation overtly, another one-third of the enterprises 
suffered losses in operation covertly, and only the remaining 
one-third of enterprises were money-making. This shows that 
two-thirds of state-owned enterprises had problems with 
efficiency. Moreover, among enterprises operating with 
relatively good efficiency, there were problems, such as that 
the running ox was whipped, cries of help came from all corners 
of the country, and expenses were wantonly apportioned for them. 
As a result, enterprises were exhausted due to heavy burdens. 
  All indications show that to effectively raise economic 
efficiency and invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises, we must switch enterprise reform from the policy 
readjustment with delegation of power and concession in revenue 
by the central authorities as the main content to the 
establishment of an enterprise system with the harmonious 
relations of property rights as the main content and proceed to 
seek a way of institutionalizing the integration of state-owned 
enterprises and the market economy. Through years of 
explorations, a consensus of understanding has been reached, 
that is, establishing a modern enterprise system. This is the 
direction of China's reform of large and medium-sized 
enterprises. Liu Guoguang maintained: Through the reform we 
must be clear about the relations of property rights. To put it 
another way, the ownership of enterprises' state-owned assets 
goes to the state and the enterprise has all the property 
rights, which is formed by the investment made the investors 
including the state, as a legal person and becomes an entity of 
legal person which has civil rights and interests and assumes 
civil responsibility. On this basis enterprises operate 
according to law, pay taxes in accordance with state 
regulations, organize production in line with the laws governing 
the market, assume full responsibility for profit and loss, and 
develop in line with the principle of selecting the superior and 
eliminating the inferior. This will help fully separate the 
functions of the government and those of the enterprises and 
help enterprises really become dynamic economic entities able to 
operate independently, be accountable for themselves, and 
improve and develop themselves. The formulation of this reform 
proposition is a very important breakthrough. 
  The problems with enterprises are very complicated. 
Enterprise reform, in which any single move taken may affect the 
situation as a whole, should be carried out in a coordinated 
way. Illustrating with examples, Liu Guoguang said: It is 
impossible to solve such problems as redundant enterprise 
personnel, the burden of enterprises running society, and 
enterprises' past debts by making a single reform. To solve 
them, supporting reforms in other fields of endeavor are needed. 
This will help create conditions for the reform of establishing 
a modern enterprise system. He said: The Decision has taken 
these factor into account. This shows that in the coming 
reform, we must be determined to solve enterprises' outstanding 
past and present problems and effectively create conditions to 
operate state-owned enterprises as companies. However, to 
operate them as companies, we must establish a standard company 
system and a standard modern enterprise system rather than just 
put up a new nameplate. We must push enterprise reform to this 
new height. 
<H3>  In Fostering a Market System, Placing Stress on Developing 
the Production Elements Market </H3>
  The prices of most commodities in China have now been 
liberalized and great advances have been made in the market 
system. Nevertheless, the Chinese market has been primarily a 
market for articles of daily use up to date. Most means of 
productions also have now become commodities, but the dual-track 
system remains operative in the prices of production means. 
Particularly, the market for such means of production as funds, 
capital, labor power, real estate, technology, and information 
is still in the embryonic stage. The current central decision 
suggested creating an environment of competition on an equal 
footing and forming a unified, open, competitive, and orderly 
big market and placed particular stress on developing the 
production elements market. 
  Liu Guoguang pointed out: In the days to come, the commodity 
circulation system calls for further reform. The commodity 
market should be further developed and improved. This is not a 
problem. However, what is important is to fully subject 
production elements to the regulation and disposition by the 
market laws and put stress on developing the production elements 
market. The specific development plan has yet to be studied. 
However, we must notice that there have been important 
breakthroughs in this regard. For example, the labor market is 
an important factor of the production elements market. In the 
past we called it the labor service market or the labor 
employment market. This is a breakthrough in theory as compared 
with our understanding of the issue before reform was 
introduced. However, the terms were not as accurate and 
scientific as the labor market. Perhaps people may ask: Since 
laborers are masters of the country, why have they become 
commodities? As I see it, laborers and labor should be 
separated. As citizens, laborers are masters of the country, 
while labor can be fully traded in the market as a means of 
production. 
  China's labor market is quite underdeveloped. In state-owned 
enterprises, personnel still cannot move fairly freely and a 
two-way choice mechanism has not taken shape. Enterprises are 
supporting large numbers of redundant personnel. Therefore, 
apparently it does not work to throw them to society lock, 
stock, and barrel. Generally speaking, it is still very 
difficult for an employee to seek another employment avenue or a 
new occupation for further development even if he wishes to. In 
the vast rural areas, labor mobility has long been developing. 
It is said that 50 million people have left their native 
villages and settled down in cities and towns. How should we 
manage this portion of people? How should we establish a market 
mechanism based on state centralized distribution, under which 
labor can move between urban and rural areas in an organized and 
secured way, so that workers and employing units can choose each 
other? These remain problems. 
  Liu Guoguang held: Although rural labor is now moving, it is 
moving blindly. Many problems have not yet been solved 
satisfactorily, such as that employment is not secured and there 
is political inequality between the employer and the employed. 
They must be solved gradually. The Decision set the 
development, utilization, and rational disposition of labor 
resources as the starting point of the development of the labor 
market. It urged the creation of new employment opportunities, 
providing more jobs to workers in cities and towns, and 
encouraging and guiding superfluous rural labor to move in an 
orderly way. This is a new line of thinking effective in 
solving problems. 
<H3>  The Decision Has a New Exposition on Macroregulation and 
Control and Offers Concrete Propositions to the Various Aspects 
of Macroregulation and Control </H3>
  The establishment of the socialist market economic structure 
is inseparable from a sound macroregulation and control system. 
It is necessary to change the functions of the government under 
the planned economy. In the market economy, the government 
manages the economy mainly with economic and legal means and 
necessary administrative fiats and no longer directly interferes 
in enterprises' production and operations. While clearly 
defining these contents, the Decision has offered relatively 
concrete propositions to the varies aspects of macroregulation 
and control. This is another important advance . 
  For example, in banking reform the Decision clearly defined 
that the People's Bank of China should be run as a genuine 
central bank, whose function is to issue currency, and "take it 
as the prime goal to stabilize currency, regulate total money 
supply, and achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure in 
terms of total quantity." Moreover, it urged to set up 
policy-oriented banks and turn specialized banks into commercial 
ones. All these are very important improvements. In the past, 
these matters were discussed in the theoretical circles but they 
have now been included in the proposal. Moreover, interest and 
exchange rates should gradually become market-oriented. It is 
very important to abolish state prices for exchange rates and 
let exchange rates float under control. 
  Again for example, in financial and taxation structural 
reform, the Decision clearly defined that the all-round 
financial contract system should be replaced by a tax sharing 
system. This is also an important advance and change. Turning 
the current local financial contract system into a tax sharing 
system based on a rational division of administrative power 
between central and local authorities will help readjust not 
only the relationship between central and local authorities, but 
also that between the state and enterprises. The all-round 
financial contract system has played a positive role in the 
past. However, as it developed it revealed its limitations. 
The main manifestation was that there was flexibility on the 
part of local authorities and enterprises while there was 
rigidity on the part of the state and central authorities. As a 
result, the central financial authorities were riddled with 
difficulties. Under these circumstances, the state was unable 
to make readjustments in important industries and regulate the 
gap between different regions. Now the Decision categorized the 
items of taxation necessary for safeguarding the state's rights 
and interests and practicing macroregulation and control as 
central taxes and the items of taxation which have a direct 
bearing on economic development as taxes shared by central and 
local authorities while suggesting substantiating local items of 
taxation so as to increase local tax revenues. This has helped 
rationally harmonize the relations between central and local 
authorities. Moreover, unification of tax laws and fairness in 
tax burdens are all important improvements. As far as the modes 
of distribution of after-tax profits between the state and the 
enterprise are concerned, there can be distribution of dividends 
according to the number of shares held, retention of profits 
according to the quantity of capital contributed, or occasional 
retention by enterprises of the profits to be handed over to the 
state for continued development. This way of doing things has 
thus more rationally harmonized the relations of interest 
between enterprises and the state. 
  Moreover, in investment system reform, the Decision urged to 
gradually establish risk liabilities for corporate investment 
and bank credits. Different projects may adopt different modes 
of investment. This is a reform proposition formed on the basis 
of the ideas which have been deliberated for many years. 
  Liu Guoguang said: The question of the relationship between 
planning, finance, and banking has in fact not been clearly 
stated in the past. The current central decision has defined 
the question. Under the traditional structure, planning has 
always been primary. There was a figurative formulation on the 
relationship of the three, stating: Planning orders dishes, 
finance foots the bill, and banking works out accounts. As 
structural reform progresses, the relationship has to change. 
To establish the socialist market economic structure, it is 
even more necessary to harmonize the relationship of the three 
in accordance with the laws governing the market economy. With 
an observation of the market economic developments of various 
countries, we can be clear that in the macroregulation and 
control of the market economy, there are two relatively 
important elements: Financial policy and banking policy. 
Although some countries also have long-term planning, it does 
not occupy an important position. From the formulation of the 
relationship between planning and finance as set by the 
Decision, we can see that although planning takes total supply 
and demand into consideration, it gives greater consideration to 
total supply and stresses making long-term structural 
readjustments. Although finance and banking also take total 
supply into consideration, they start mainly with the management 
of total demand and stress regulating and controlling short-term 
balances in terms of total quantity. There is a division of 
labor between financial authorities and banks. Financial 
authorities are generally in charge of the redistribution of 
national income, which is done without compensation. Repayments 
of capital with interest should be made for the use of credits. 
In the past, when financial authorities incurred deficits, they 
would make overdrafts from banks, turning financial deficits 
into credit deficits. In the market economy, this practice does 
not work any longer. Financial authorities and banks should be 
clearly separated. The former can borrow money from the latter 
but should not make overdrafts without compensation. In short, 
the Decision has a clear formulation of the relationship between 
planning, finance, and banking, which is a great step forward 
from the previous practice. 
  When asked about his views on this year's reform situation 
at the conclusion of the interview, with full confidence Liu 
Guoguang said: The year 1994 will see the greatest number of 
reforms introduced and the biggest reform action taken. The 
Decision has provided a grand blueprint for reforms in the next 
step in the new year. As I see it, through the hard work of the 
entire party and the people throughout the country, this grand 
goal can be completely attained.

<F P=106> [By Wang Zhongyu, Minister of the State Economic and Trade </F>
Commission: "Vigorously Introduce the New Taxation System To 
Pave the Way for Equal Market Competition"] 
  [Text] The decision adopted at the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee clearly stated the need to 
reform and perfect the taxation system in keeping with the 
principle of unifying tax laws, sharing tax in a fair way, 
simplifying the taxation system, and rationally distributing 
powers. The promulgation of such tax regulations as the PRC 
Interim Regulations on Value Added Tax is a mark that China's 
tax reform has already entered a new stage. An important task 
before leaders at all levels on the economic front is to 
correctly understand the great significance of tax reform at 
this time, smoothen the changeover and transition from the old 
taxation system to the new, and enable enterprises to meet the 
needs of the new situation as soon as possible, enter the 
market, and participate in fair competition. 
<H3>  I. It is Necessary To Fully Understand the Great 
Significance of Tax Reform </H3>
  A. Putting into practice the tax division system whereby tax 
revenues are shared by central and local authorities is 
conducive to breaking regional barriers and forming a unified 
market. 
  Developing a socialist market economy demands a unified and 
open market. The various systems currently practiced in all 
localities whereby local governments are responsible for their 
own finances have played a great role in changing the 
traditional planned system of centralizing control over revenues 
and expenditures and in developing their economies. But as 
reform is deepening and the socialist market economy is 
developing, this type of system -- which delineates financial 
revenues in keeping with the administrative subordination of 
enterprises -- has to some extent strengthened the government's 
administrative interference in enterprises and weakened the 
tax-revenue regulating function, and easily causes unequal 
distribution and enlarges the gap of economic and social 
development between regions. Practicing the tax division system 
is conducive to breaking the man-made boundaries, establishing 
fair exchanges of commodities between different regions, and 
promoting the formation of a nationwide unified market. 
  B. By unifying the income taxes of home enterprises, we have 
changed the practice of setting tax categories according to the 
nature of ownership, and this is conducive to fair tax sharing 
and to promoting fair competition. 
  There are now four categories of income tax for enterprises 
in China. For large and medium enterprises, we levy a 
proportional tax which is 55 percent of their revenues. We also 
levy the regulatory tax on some of these enterprises. For small 
enterprises and collective enterprises, we use the eight-step 
progressive rates levied on income in excess of specific 
amounts, with the highest tax rate being 55 percent. For 
private enterprises, we levy a proportional rate which is 35 
percent. The income tax rate for foreign-invested enterprises 
is 30 percent plus 3 percent of local additional tax. The 
income tax rate for enterprises in special economic zones and 
economic and technological development districts is 15 percent. 
The income tax for productive enterprises in the old urban 
areas of coastal open cities is 24 percent, plus 3 percent of 
local additional tax. In this way, different tax categories 
have been set in accordance with different forms of ownership in 
a way that tax rates and preferential treatment differ, causing 
enterprises to shoulder unfair tax burdens. The tax reform this 
time has unified the income taxes levied on home enterprises and 
standardized the before-tax deductions and expenditure criteria 
[lie zhi biao zhun 0441 2388 2871 3294]. On the basis of 
preventing the tax bases from being eroded, it has lowered the 
nominal tax rates for state-owned enterprises; canceled the fund 
for key energy and transportation construction projects, the 
budget readjustment fund, and the regulatory tax levied solely 
on large and medium state-owned enterprises; and standardized 
the distribution relationships between the state and 
enterprises, thus creating conditions for enterprises with 
different forms of ownership to share taxes fairly and to 
participate in fair competition. 
  C. We have adopted the circulating-tax system which is 
comparatively standard internationally and which takes the 
value-added tax as the main body, thus reducing the repeated 
levying of taxes and encouraging the optimum allocation of 
resources and specialized coordination. 
  At present, China's circulating taxes for home enterprises 
and foreign enterprises are inconsistent. They are very much 
graded and their tax rates vary greatly. For instance, the 
value-added tax rates for home enterprises range from 8 percent 
to 45 percent and are divided into 13 grades, product tax rates 
range from 3 percent to 60 percent and are divided into 21 
grades, business tax rates range from 3 percent to 15 percent 
and are divided into four grades, and the industrial and 
commercial consolidated tax rates for foreign enterprises range 
from 1.5 percent to 69 percent and are divided into 40 grades. 
Many of these tax rates were set for regulating the irrational 
price differences under the planned economy. Following the 
gradual lifting of price restrictions and the development of the 
market economy, the current taxation system must be reformed. In 
keeping with the practice of most countries, China's new 
taxation system has adopted the circulating tax system whose 
main body is the value-added tax. It embodies the principle of 
fairness, neutrality, universality, and simplicity. "Fairness" 
means it standardizes the circulating taxes on home and foreign 
enterprises and specifically regulates a small number of 
commodities by levying the consumption tax. "Neutrality" means 
that we take the amount of value added as the taxable object and 
that in calculating taxes, we deduct the transfer value of the 
means of production in the course of commodity production, 
deduct the amount of collected taxes on the goods purchased and 
already put to use, thus avoiding the repeated levying of taxes 
so that the same product will not shoulder different taxes as a 
result of the different organizational modes of enterprises and 
of the difference in the number of transactions made. 
"Universality" means that the value-added tax covers the entire 
process of commodity production and circulation and forms a tax 
system which exists ubiquitously whether in production and 
circulation. "Simplicity" means thoroughly simplifying the tax 
rates and setting only one basic tax rate and one low-grade tax 
rate. These principles meet the objective demands of socialized 
large-scale production and of developing market economy and are 
conducive to the optimum allocation of resources and to 
converging with the international market. 
  The direction of the tax reform this time is completely 
correct. Following the deepening of reform and the increasing 
degree of marketization, the significance of the tax system 
reform will become more and more fully manifested. 
<H3>  II. Strengthen the Study, Understanding, and Grasping of the 
Basic Spirit and Main Contents of Tax Reform </H3>
  Many contents of the current tax reform are totally new. 
Many enterprises do not have much understanding of the specific 
contents or a basic knowledge of tax reform. They are 
comparatively unfamiliar with how the new taxation system 
operates; for example, the calculation method for the new 
value-added system, the new ways of tax collection and 
management, and the management of receipts. Therefore, the most 
important thing at the present time is to study and really 
understand the basic spirit of tax reform and make great efforts 
to grasp its specific contents. Moreover, it is necessary to 
enable vast numbers of staff and workers to understand and grasp 
the following points: 
  -- On the whole, the current tax reform does not increase 
the 
tax burden on enterprises. Tax reform has a direct bearing on 
the interests of vast numbers of enterprises and staff and 
workers. The tax reform plan embodies the principle of not 
increasing the tax burden on enterprises, as has been repeatedly 
stressed by leading comrades of the State Council. According to 
the data of a general survey by the Ministry of Finance, the 
average tax-sharing rate of industrial enterprises is basically 
the same before and after reform. The results of a preliminary 
survey of 282 industrial products across the country show that 
73 of them have their taxes increased, or 26 percent, and 209 of 
them have their taxes lowered, or 74 percent. This shows that 
most trades' and enterprises' tax burdens will not be increased 
following tax reform. Of course, enterprises and their products 
differ greatly, the current tax categories and tax rates are 
numerous, and deductions and preferential policies differ. 
After a change to the new tax system, the increase or decrease 
of taxes on every enterprise differs completely. But the tax 
increases in some areas can be alleviated through mutual 
regulation. For example, in the case of commodity circulation, 
it is predicted from the data of a general survey by the 
Ministry of Finance that after the tax reform, wholesale 
enterprises will have their taxes increased by a 0.44 percentage 
points, while retail enterprises will have their taxes lowered 
by 2.5 percentage points. Although wholesale enterprises' taxes 
have been increased, due to the retail trade's tax decreases, 
the final retail prices which are directly shouldered by 
consumers should not fluctuate greatly as a result of tax 
reform. Moreover, it can promote the integration of production, 
wholesaling, and retailing. All in all, since the circulating 
tax burden has not increased, retail enterprises should not thus 
increase prices. Industrial and commercial enterprises should 
look back at themselves, make the best use of the policies 
adopted for them as well as the measures intended to lighten 
their burdens, strengthen management, and lower costs. They 
should never increase prices in such a way as to increase 
consumers' burdens as a result of tax reform. 
  -- To smoothly put into practice the tax reform plan, the 
state has also adopted some policies to lighten the tax burden 
on enterprises. It has simplified and merged the enterprise 
income taxes, lowered the rate rates, and lowered the nominal 
income tax rates for state-owned large and medium enterprises 
from 55 percent to 33 percent, and canceled state-owned 
enterprises' regulatory tax; exempted the fund for energy, 
communications, and key construction projects and the budget 
readjustment fund (called the "two funds" for short), which 
account for 25 percent of the after-tax profits retained by 
enterprises, which has had to be turned over to the state 
previously, and which is now retained by enterprises. The 
after-tax profits of old state-owned enterprises are not to be 
turned over to the state in the near future and are retained by 
enterprises for their use. For enterprises making low profits, 
we adopt such measures as levying for two years two grades of 
transition tax ranging from 27 percent and 18 percent. All 
these measures are intended to lighten enterprises' tax burdens. 
Enterprises should make the best of the above policies, enhance 
their stamina for future development, and improve their 
competitiveness on the market. 
  -- We will use the method of differentiating new and old 
loans and measures to lighten enterprises' burdens and enhance 
their ability to repay the loans. At present, most enterprises 
are worried about the question of how they are going to repay 
loans after tax reform. We should say that through measures of 
lightening enterprises' burden, enterprises' ability to repay 
loans will be enhanced. However, considering the present 
situation of enterprises, the state has formulated two different 
repayment methods for old and new loans. Enterprises making good 
profits can have their ability to repay loans enhanced by 
counting depreciation and long-term interest as costs. As for 
enterprises shouldering a comparatively heavy debt burden which 
has been left over from the past, the state is studying and 
formulating some transitional measures to gradually clear the 
irrational debts incurred for external reasons. 
<H3>  III. Smooth the Transition and Changeover From the New 
Taxation System to the New One and Ensure the Smooth 
Implementation of the New Taxation System </H3>
  A. It is necessary to smooth the transition from the 
contracted responsibility system to a unified tax system. 
  Of our industrial enterprises, 80 percent practice the 
contract management responsibility system. This form of 
management was a invention by vast numbers of enterprises and 
staff and workers in the course of implementing reform. It has 
played an important role in bringing into play the initiative of 
enterprises and staff and workers and in developing productive 
forces. The introduction of the new tax reform has radically 
changed the foundation on which the contract responsibility 
rests, because after the taxation system is reformed and after 
the tax division system is practiced, the value-added tax, which 
will become the largest tax category and which is shared both by 
the central and local authorities, is collected by the State 
General Administration of Taxation. Therefore, it will no 
longer be practical to continue with the contract responsibility 
system on a large scale. Moreover, since the cost structure has 
changed following the implementation of the "two sets of 
regulations," the book profits of enterprises have decreased by 
a comparatively large margin and many enterprises have no profit 
target to overfulfill or to contract on. All this reflects that 
the nonstandardized distribution relationships cannot meet the 
needs of the market economy. Faced with this situation, we must 
further explore ideas for reform and should not merely find the 
way out by readjusting the distribution relationships between 
the state and enterprises, but should actively explore new ways 
of invigorating enterprises. We should change from the 
contracted responsibility system to a unified tax system on our 
own initiative. 
  To guarantee the transition from the contracted 
responsibility system to a unified taxation system, the state 
has adopted a special policy for those contracting enterprises 
that have obtained the approval of the State Council or the 
provincial people's government to contract on overall input and 
output before the "No. Six Document of 1993" was issued. 
According to the policy, for a transitional period of two 
years, localities will be assigned taxes first and then 
reimbursed. These enterprises should make the best use of the 
policies in the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, 
attach great importance to technological transformation, 
conscientiously strengthen their stamina, greatly replenish 
their own circulating funds, and enhance their rejuvenating 
functions. Enterprises should cherish this transition period and 
remove the burden on their own initiative. 
  B. Adopt flexible transitional methods in keeping with 
different situations. 
  Although regional preferential taxation policies do not 
fully 
conform with the fair tax-sharing principle, considering the 
fact that coastal regions are the windows on China's reform and 
opening up, if we cancel the regional preferential taxation 
treatment it will affect the investment environment and will be 
nonconducive to their further reform and opening up. For this 
reason, the state has adopted transitional measures. For 
example, we can adopt the transitional measure of tax 
reimbursement [shui shou fan huan 4451 2392 6604 6703] for 
taxpayers in special economic zones and in coastal areas which 
are enjoying preferential taxation treatment. After the 
value-added tax is universally levied on home and foreign 
enterprises, we can use the method of reimbursing 
foreign-invested enterprises for their actual increased taxes at 
the end of each year, or many times in different years so as to 
guarantee the stability and continuity of the foreign-related 
taxation policy. Moreover, the State Council will use 
transitional methods for some special enterprises that were 
originally exempt from taxation. All these measures are 
conducive to the smooth transition from the old taxation system 
to the new. 
  C. We will pay good attention to publicizing tax regulations 
and formulate and introduce policies related to the changeover 
from the old taxation system to the new so that enterprises are 
prepared and will dispel unnecessary misunderstandings. 
  Practicing the new taxation system is an overall reform of 
the old taxation system and is an important step toward the 
market economy. But putting into practice the new taxation 
system involves many specific questions. As for the question of 
how to deduct taxes this year from the stocks of enterprises' 
raw materials and finished products that were already taxed last 
year, the State General Administration of Taxation has already 
made specific regulations regarding this and has fully 
considered the actual situation of enterprises, and it will not 
happen that enterprises bear an abnormally heavy or abnormally 
light tax burden. For some specific questions in some special 
trades, we still need to formulate specific methods. 
<H3>  IV. Enterprises Should Adapt to the New Situation As Soon As 
Possible and Should Enter the Market and Participate in Fair 
Competition </H3>
  A. Change concepts and make efforts to meet the new needs of 
the market economy. 
  The great reforms in finance and taxation, banking, 
investment, and foreign trade will cause a profound change in 
enterprises' external environment. Enterprises should further 
emancipate the mind and change concepts in the following aspects: 
  First, it is necessary to change the idea that state-owned 
enterprises are units for state budgeting and are directly under 
governmental supervisory departments and foster the new idea 
that they are "taxpayers" that possess independent corporate 
property rights. Like all other enterprises, state-owned 
enterprises should operate independently, assume sole 
responsibility for losses and profits, be levied taxes according 
to the law, enter the market, and participate in fair 
competition. 
  Second, it is necessary to change the traditional practice 
whereby the state has had too much control over state-owned 
enterprises, foster the new idea that the survival of the 
fittest is the objective law of market competition, and the idea 
that enterprises that make losses for a long time and that are 
unable to repay debts should go bankrupt according to the law. 
This will strengthen the sense of urgency and the sense of 
crisis of enterprises in striving for survival and development 
in the face of market competition. 
  Third, it is necessary to change the thinking that 
enterprises merely demand tax reductions and profit concessions 
during enterprise reform and focus on changing the mechanism and 
bringing innovations in the enterprise system. It is necessary 
to strengthen enterprises' competitiveness through establishing 
a new enterprise system. 
  B. Conscientiously implement the "two sets of regulations" 
and properly reappraise the stocks and assets of enterprises, 
laying the groundwork for enterprises to enter the market and 
compete fairly. 
  From 1 July 1993 onward, all enterprises must implement the 
"two sets of regulations." In reappraising the stocks and 
assets of enterprises next year, we should continue to increase 
experimentation. These two jobs are to support the new tax 
reform to be introduced soon. They are, as we can say, the 
foundation for the new taxation system. If properly used, the 
10-point policy laid down in the Ministry of Finance's "Circular 
on the Question of Convergence Regarding the Implementation of 
Enterprises' New Financial System" (Financial Work Document 
Number 199 of 1993) and the 10-point policy laid down in the 
State Council General Office's "Circular on Relevant Policies 
for Increasing Experimentation With the Reappraisal of the 
Stocks and Assets of Enterprises" (Number 29 issued by the State 
Council General Office in 1993), in particular, will be 
conducive to reappraising the property being used by legal 
entities and digest part of the hidden losses, laying a 
foundation for state-owned enterprises to lighten their 
historical burdens, enter the market, and participate in fair 
competition. 
  C. Quicken the readjustment of the product mix and the 
organizational structure of enterprises. 
  After the financial and taxation systems have been reformed, 
enterprises with good performance will probably have a better 
financing environment, while those with bad performance, 
especially those that have made operational losses, rather than 
those that incurred losses as a result of policy, can no longer 
survive on subsidies. We will probably make substantial 
progress in the structural readjustment, which we have stressed 
for many years, under the conditions of market economy. 
  At present, we are preparing to call the National Work 
Conference on Structural Readjustment in the first quarter of 
1994 and plan to take a larger step in the following three 
areas: First, support state-owned large and medium enterprises 
that are really strong in developing large, transregional, and 
intertrade enterprise groups whose major link is property 
rights, and bring into play their role in promoting structural 
readjustment, improving the scale merit, quickening the 
development of new technologies and new products, and 
strengthening international competitiveness. Second, vigorously 
promote reform of the property rights of medium and small 
enterprises, invigorate the stocks of state-owned assets, and 
shift them to profit-making industries through a variety of 
forms including contracting, leasing, selling, and mergers. 
Enterprises that are making great losses and are insolvent at 
the due date should resolutely be forced to go bankrupt. Third, 
gradually settle the question that enterprises look after almost 
all matters in society. Large and medium state-owned 
enterprises should gradually withdraw from the function of doing 
social service, change to tertiary industry, and gradually sever 
relations with their original enterprises. 
  D. Change the management mechanism of state-owned 
enterprises and positively and steadily introduce a modern 
enterprise system: 
  Establishing a modern enterprise system is the direction for 
the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. We must change 
the administrative subordination of state-owned enterprises to 
the state to the relationship whereby they are linked by assets, 
establish a mechanism within enterprises by which the owners, 
managers, and staff and workers check and restrict one other, 
settling the question of the inseparable functions of government 
and the enterprise once and for all. At present, we should 
mainly implement the Regulations on Changing the Management 
Mechanism and the Regulation on Supervision which is to be 
introduced soon, and quicken the change of the management 
mechanism of state-owned enterprises. The Regulations on 
Changing the Management Mechanism are the cornerstone for 
establishing socialist market economy. We must ensure that the 
powers and responsibilities conferred by the Regulations on 
Changing the Management Mechanism are 100 percent delegated, 
laying the groundwork for establishing a modern enterprise 
system. The Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC approved China's 
first Company Law, which is a big event in China's economic 
life. It is the legal basis for us to establish a modern 
enterprise system in a planned way and systematically and to 
reorganize state-owned enterprises to the corporate system. We 
must quicken the change of the management mechanism and the 
establishment of the corporate system in line with the spirit of 
the decision and the provisions of the Company Law so as to 
enable enterprises to become the main body in market competition 
and to bring out their new vitality and vigor in a competitive 
environment where tax is shared fairly.

<F P=106> [Report: "A Central Leader Says Competition Should Be </F>
Introduced to Foreign Trade to Break Monopoly"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--A central leader 
recently said that monopolies in foreign trade should be 
replaced with competition. This year, the problem of unfair 
competition between foreign trade enterprises should be solved. 
In the future, individuals will be allowed to engage in foreign 
trade, but this cannot be effected for the time being. 
  The leader said that there is no overheating in foreign 
trade. As long as the market exists and goods can be sold at a 
good profit, the more are sold, the better. Reform in the 
foreign trade system will break monopolies and decentralize 
management power. In 1988, provincial trade companies received 
foreign trade powers. In 1990, the problem of unequal 
competition between localities was solved. In 1994, the problem 
of unequal competition between enterprises should be solved. 
Foreign trade should move from monopoly to competition. Export 
subsidies should be stopped. As a result, China's foreign trade 
will rank in a more advanced position in the world. Finally, 
foreign trade will be conducted by business groups, and small 
foreign trade companies are just transitional forms. Eventually, 
there will be a number of large corporations, like those in 
Japan. 
  The leader said that conditions should be created for an 
export agency system. Foreign trade companies should be 
gradually turned into productive enterprises with fixed bases. 
Action should be started from improving the variety of 
products, and the integration of foreign trade with industrial 
and agricultural production should be promoted. Some people 
asked why individuals are not allowed to engage in foreign 
trade. This may be effected in the future, but this is still 
impossible for the time being. Joint-stock companies with 
shares held by workers inside enterprises can be established, 
because this is an effective way to invigorate state-owned 
foreign trade enterprises.

  [Text] Lanzhou, 20 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The other 
day, the State Planning Commission held a foreign capital 
utilization work forum in Gansu's Lanzhou City, which was 
attended by 11 provinces and cities from northwest and southwest 
China. The message coming from the seminar indicates that in 
order to promote reform, opening up, and economic development in 
central and western parts of China, the utilization of foreign 
capital in China will be inclined to inland provinces during the 
period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan. 
  The seminar proposed that to support the development of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction in the central and 
western regions, the focus of the country's utilization of 
foreign capital will be tilted to inland provinces during the 
period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan to increase the strength of 
construction projects in the central and western regions, help 
boost economic construction in inland provinces on an overall 
scale, narrow the economic gap between the inland provinces and 
the coastal regions, quicken the pace of all reform undertakings 
in China, and promote the cooperation and development of 
complementary projects. 
  It is known that three projects Gansu Province has procured 
have been listed in the state's foreign capital utilization 
plan. The three projects are a 30,000-line program-controlled 
telephone system, with an investment of $47 million; 
comprehensive treatment of atmospheric pollution in Lanzhou, 
with an investment of $100 million; and a key water control 
project in the Shule He Valley, with an investment of $150 
million.

<F P=106> [From "China Economic News" column: "Policies for </F>
Attracting Foreign Investment To Undergo Comprehensive 
Readjustment"] 
  [Text] Reportedly, China will soon hold a national work 
conference to consider the comprehensive readjustment of its 
policy for attracting foreign investment. 
  The basic guiding points for the adjustment of the policy to 
attract foreign investment are as follows: 
  --Maintaining the stability and continuity of existing 
policies. 
  --Gradually making industrial policy and taxation policy for 
foreign-funded enterprises converge with those for domestic 
enterprises, thus effecting fair competition and equal treatment. 
  --Adapting relevant regulations to the requirements of GATT 
rules and international practice. 
  Local policies for attracting foreign investment will also 
undergo major adjustments. Over the last 10 years and more, 
China's opening up to the outside world was mainly effected by 
its policy of opening up the coastal areas and offering 
favorable policies to coastal areas, special economic zones, and 
development zones. Henceforth, the same policies will be applied 
to various types of localities. New development zones will no 
longer enjoy favorable tax terms, which used to be the main 
attractive feature of the development zones. In backward areas, 
foreign-funded enterprises will be allowed to engage in simple 
processing, but foreign investment in such industries will be 
limited in the coastal areas and special economic zones. 
  On the other hand, the Chinese Government will revoke 
special 
favorable policies applied to overseas Chinese investors and 
investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and will revoke the 
policy of cutting taxes in half applied to some neighboring 
countries, especially the CIS countries. That is, the same 
policies will be applied to foreign investors from all countries 
and regions. 
  In the future, the Chinese Government will open up markets 
to 
attract new and high technology and to attract investment from 
large transnational corporations. The Chinese Government will 
continue to encourage three types of foreign-funded enterprises 
to export their products, to effect import substitution, and to 
maintain the foreign exchange balance in their business 
operations. It will also formulate favorable policies to 
encourage foreign investment in agriculture, in the 
technological transformation of large and medium-sized 
enterprises, and in the construction of urban infrastructure.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Chen Yun (7115 5366): "China Forms </F>
Preliminary System Governing the Import of Machinery and 
Electronic Products"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- Using the regulations 
of GATT and international practice for reference, China's new 
system governing the import of machinery and electronic products 
has officially been in operation since the beginning of this 
year. This system will play a positive role in stepping up the 
pace of linking China's economy with the world economy, and in 
restoring China's status as a contracting party of GATT at an 
early date. 
  To open wider to the outside world, China canceled import 
permits, quotas, and control on some products as well as 
readjusted and reduced tariff rates on 3,371 taxable items and 
products in the past year, 1993. Also spurred by its speedy 
economic growth, China imported machinery and electronic 
products worth $49.46 billion in 1993, up 41.7 percent from 
1992, and far higher than the 29-percent growth of total 
imports. The total import value of machinery and electronic 
products accounted for 47.6 percent of the total, up 5 
percentage points from the previous year. With the State 
Council's approval, China officially promulgated the 
"Provisional Rules Governing the Import of Machinery and 
Electronic Products" in the fourth quarter of last year and, in 
the meantime, formulated the supporting "Catalogue of Products 
Subject to Quotas," "Catalogue of Specific Products," and 
corresponding rules for implementation. Thus, a new system 
governing the import of machinery and electronic products was 
preliminarily formed. 
  According to Xu Bingjin, who is in charge of the State 
Machinery Import and Export Office, this new management system 
has brought about significant reform in four aspects: 
  1. It has largely shrunk the scope of management on the 
import of machinery and electronic products, and regulated 
import mainly through quotas, tariffs, openly inviting tenders, 
and means conforming to international practice. The 
internationally accepted import quota system will be imposed on 
a handful of key machinery and electronic products -- the 18 
products include automobiles, motorcycles, video cameras, 
computers, and air conditioners -- which will seriously harm the 
development of relevant industries, and directly affect the 
readjustment of industrial structure and product mix in China if 
they are imported excessively. The 171 kinds of machinery and 
electronic products, in which China has invested a great sum of 
capital to develop and manufacture or has imported the 
technology to produce them and which are still at an early stage 
of industrial production and need to speed up their development, 
will be placed in the catalogue of specific products, whose 
import will mainly be done through international bidding. 
Meanwhile, the rules on machinery and electronic products 
temporarily banned from import, and the import permit system for 
them, all statements of import substitution and relevant 
measures, the catalogue of products imported under unified and 
centralized planning, the catalogue of controlled import goods, 
and the regulatory tax on imported machinery and electronic 
products have been canceled. It is estimated that if the 
aforementioned significant lessening in administration is 
realized, the proportion of import value of state-controlled 
machinery and electronic products to China's total import value 
will drop under 10 percent. 
  2. It has simplified the import procedures by canceling the 
system of examining and approving the import of machinery and 
electronic products according to quotas, and establishing an 
automatic registration system which not only conforms to the 
international practice but also is conducive to strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  3. It has increased the transparency of import management. 
All policies and measures involving import management will be 
released in time. In addition, all the old documents concerning 
import management will be screened according to the new 
management measures; those incompatible with the new measures 
will be abolished, and those requiring revision or continuing to 
be enforced will also be announced. 
  4. According to the GATT rules, it has set up a system of 
indemnification measures to eliminate or reduce the harm or 
threat of harm to relevant domestic industries when certain 
products are increased sharply. Where necessary, temporary 
measures to limit the import of certain products will be taken 
according to the relevant rules of GATT and legal procedures of 
the state. 
  Xu Bingjin told this reporter: From now on, the State 
Machinery Import and Export Office will focus its work on 
strengthening overall import management, examination, and 
supervision of key products in the catalogues of controlled 
items. As for this year's overall import regulation and 
control, it will emphasize readjusting the import structure, 
ensuring the needs for construction of the state's basic 
industries and infrastructure and the technical transformation 
of large and medium-sized state enterprises, continuing to 
control the import of consumer goods, supporting the import of 
advanced technology and equipment, and supporting 
export-oriented projects.

  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- China is mulling 
over how to implement a sustainable development strategy while 
shaping its development model for the next decade. 
  To implement a sustainable development strategy, said Gao 
Guangsheng, official from the State Planning Commission, is to 
develop the economy on the basis of protecting the ecological 
environment from deterioration and keeping resources sustainably 
available. 
  At an international seminar on the environmental protection 
action plan which closed today, Gao said, the old development 
model characterized by high input and high consumption is no 
longer in keeping with reality. 
  Experts at the seminar said that the basic ways of realizing 
the sustainable development strategy include increasing the 
efficiency in using resources and energy, waste recycling, and 
developing new alternative resources. 
  According to the official, China is considering the 
selection 
of about 100 priority projects concerning key problems which 
urgently need to be solved in implementing the strategy, to 
promote cooperation with international environmental protection 
organizations. 
  "The first batch of priority projects will be selected by 
March this year," he said. 
  The official said these projects will be those with a 
sufficient input of funds. 
  Cooperation is necessary in this field, since seeking 
development is the common task for all countries in the world, 
said Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the National Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
  "As a developing country, China should use the experience of 
other countries, especially of developed countries, for 
reference," Zhang said. 
  He said China has promoted cooperation with Britain, 
Germany, 
Denmark and Canada in this field and some projects are in 
progress or under discussion.

Hongyang (0719 3126 3152): "Grain: From 200 to 456.4 Billion Kg"] 
  [Text] Food is the first necessity of the people, and 
grain is the foundation of food. The Chinese people in 
particular realize the truth in this because they have led 
difficult lives owing to grain shortages for considerably long 
periods of time. 
  Some 30 years ago, we were proud of our lofty aspirations 
that "we may make the land yield as much grain as we wish so 
long as we are bold enough to command it," and we were also 
delighted at the "good news" that "10,000 jin or even 100,000 
jin of grain was reaped per mu." However, in 1958, a year full 
of vigor and dynamism, the total grain yield throughout the 
country was only 200 billion kg. After that, we worked hard 
unflinchingly to strive for the targets of 200, 250, and 400 kg 
per unit area yield in different regions as stipulated in the 
National Program for Agricultural Development. But, it was not 
until 20 long years had passed that the country's grain output 
was raised to the level of 300 billion kgs. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee 
lifted the curtain of China's rural reform, under which the 
contract responsibility system on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output was universally practiced like a 
spring tide which pushed forward substantial increases in grain 
yields. Document No. 1 of the Party Central Committee discussed 
the agricultural issue for five consecutive years from 1982. In 
1984, China's grain yield hit a record high by breaking through 
the level of 400 billion kgs, and per capita grain possession 
approached 400 kgs for the first time. 
  The total yield of 400 billion kgs considerably mitigated 
the 
contradiction between demand and supply of grain in China. In 
the few years that followed, given some short periods of 
fluctuation, demand and supply were relatively stable, and great 
ups and downs did not occur in the markets. Even in 1991 when 
China was seriously afflicted by floods, demand and supply were 
basically balanced, and grain prices in the market were stable. 
The year 1993 once again saw brilliant achievements in grain 
production as output reached 456.4 billion kg. What needs to be 
pointed out is that, while guaranteeing the grain production 
level, peasants have paid greater attention to grain quality, 
with the proportion of refined and quality grain substantially 
enhanced, which is quite different from the past. Counties in 
which grain yield per mu exceeds 1 ton have emerged not only in 
the south, but also in northern provinces, including Shandong, 
Henan, and so on. 
  Of course, in order to achieve the goal of 500 billion kg -- 
total grain yield per year -- by the end of the century, greater 
efforts are still necessary. Compared with countries that are 
rich in per capita land resources, our per capita possession of 
grain is still very low and, compared with countries with high 
agricultural production levels, the gap is rather big in terms 
of per unit area yield. However, since the old structure which 
hindered growth of the productive forces in grain has been 
broken, we are able to make limited land yield more grain so 
long as we have appropriate policies and powerful measures.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The State 
Statistical Bureau Population Statistics Department disclosed 
that a total of 420 million people actually engage in farming in 
China, accounting for 60 percent of the working population. 
  An analysis of related materials shows that the so-called 
"900 million peasants" refers to the "900 million people" whose 
domiciles are in the countryside. Since China introduced the 
reform and opening up policy, however, some peasants have 
transferred to urban areas. Of the so-called 900 million 
peasants, only 797 million, namely 88.4 percent of the total, 
reside in the countryside, while the remaining 105 million have 
moved to cities and towns. Therefore, China actually has 797 
million farmers, of these 523 million work in the countryside 
and the remaining 274 million are children and elderly people 
who can no longer work. Of the 523 million working in the 
countryside, only 420 million engage in farming and the 
remaining 60 million [figures as published] work in 
non-agricultural fields.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Preparatory work 
for Xiaolangdi Water Conservancy Project on the Yellow River, 
the second largest of its kind in China, is nearing completion. 
  The preparatory work, which began at the end of 1991 and is 
expected to be completed eight months ahead of schedule, has 
cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 137 million U.S. dollars). 
  Infrastructure for the project, including facilities for 
transport, water and electric supplies, telecommunications and 
facilities to house the construction workers, has been completed. 
  Roads totalling 60 km, covering the construction site, have 
opened to traffic. The Yellow River bridge, or Huang He bridge, 
which ranks first in China in handling capacity, has been built. 
  The rail transshipment station, which is expected to handle 
nearly one million tons of materials and equipment, is also 
nearing completion. 
  During a recent inspection of the construction site, Deputy 
Minister of Water Conservancy Zhang Chunyuan urged all the 
workers to continue to work hard so that the principal part of 
the project will start this year. 
  Located about 130 km downstream from the Sanmen Gorges Dam 
in 
central China's Henan Province, the Xiaolangdi Water Control 
Project has a designed storage capacity of 12.6 billion cubic 
meters. 
  Experts say that the 11-year project, together with other 
reservoirs nearby, will enable the lower reaches of the river to 
resist the level of a flood that occurs only once in one 
thousand years, instead of its present water-control capacity of 
only once in dozens of years. 
  The project will make it possible to basically eliminate ice 
runs plaguing the lower reaches and prevent the Yellow River bed 
in the lower reaches from silting and rising, which has been a 
constant problem for hundreds of years. 
  The project will cost hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. 
Part of the project will use loans from the World Bank, and 
international bidding will be invited for the undertaking.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 26 (AFP)--Hong Kong pressed China 
yet again Wednesday to stop arguing in public and return to the 
bargaining table to resolve the vexed issue of financing 
arrangements for the colony's mammoth new airport. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said he was 
"disappointed" by Beijing's threat the day before not to honor 
debts or contracts linked with Chek Lap Kok airport which 
straddle 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to China. 
  "We are quite sure that the best way to make progress on the 
airport financing issue is to talk about it in the airport 
committee," Macleod told reporters. "That's the best way of 
finding a solution." 
  Government sources, requesting anonymity, spoke more 
forcefully. 
  "The statement doesn't change anything at all," one of them 
said. 
  "We're single-minded about talking with them before the next 
crisis occurs ... The longer the delay, the greater the cost 
for all concerned -- especially for Hong Kong." 
  China has failed to respond to a formal British request on 
January 17 to reconvene the airport committee of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, charged with overseeing the 
20.3 billion U.S. dollar project. 
  Instead it put out a statement Tuesday damning Governor 
Chris 
Patten's administration for securing 1.67 billion Hong Kong 
dollars (216 million U.S.) in stop-gap financing from 
legislators to keep the vast project going. 
  China, it warned, "will not be liable for any expenditure 
and 
debt incurred by building the new airport," nor would it honor 
airport-related contracts or laws straddling 1997 -- which is 
also the year Chek Lap Kok is due to open. 
  Britain agreed in a September 1991 pact to consult China on 
airport financing, but talks soon fell victim to Patten's effort 
to make Hong Kong's political insitutions more democratic ahead 
of the 1997 return to Beijing. 
  Macleod said he drew "some encouragement" from the 
statement's final paragraph, which stressed that Beijing "has 
always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong." 
  But he and other government officials were bewildered by its 
allegation that the project so far would leave the post-1997 
Hong Kong Chinese administration with debts in excess of 45 
billion dollars (5.82 billion U.S.). 
  In fact, no money has been borrowed for Chek Lap Kok, one of 
the world's biggest public works projects, comprising not only 
the airport, but also a high-speed railway and new highways and 
bridges. 
  "They haven't borrowed a single cent yet," the government 
source said. 
  Besides, the 1991 Sino-British understanding on which the 
allegation was based referred to debt raised by the Hong Kong 
government -- not by government-owned corporations that will run 
the airport and railway. 
  While the war of words rages on, work continues 24 hours a 
day -- and, officials say, well on schedule -- at Chek Lap Kok, 
an outlying island one hour by boat from central Hong Kong that 
is shrouded by a fog of dust whipped up by giant yellow 
bulldozers and dump trucks. 
  Site reclamation director Frans Uiterwijk told foreign 
reporters that nearly 40 percent of the site preparation work 
has so far been completed by a multinational consortium of six 
companies -- including one owned by China. 
  "For the bulk (of the site work), I don't see any problem," 
he said, confident that the task will be completed in February 
1996 -- clearing the way for the first of two runways to be laid. 
  A deep hole the size of several football fields marks where 
the futuristic terminal building will be, pending foundation 
work to begin after contracts are awarded in March.

<F P=106> [By Fanny Wong, Chris Yeung and So Lai-fun] </F>
  [Text] China and Hong Kong yesterday narrowed their 
differences over financing the new airport, with Beijing saying 
it would be flexible in the amount of borrowings it would allow 
to extend beyond 1997 and Hong Kong expressing willingness to 
pump more money into the venture. 
  Although the two sides fell short of specifying how flexible 
they might be in the amount of equity injection and debt 
ceiling, a leading pro-China party yesterday announced its 
counter-proposal for the Government to inject a total of $89.2 
billion to fund the $99.2 billion airport and railway projects. 
  Yesterday's revelation of the counter-proposal by the 
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) came 
amid an argument between the two sides on whether China had 
three months ago put forward a new set of proposals to finance 
the airport and the rail link. 
  Government sources yesterday stressed that the last proposal 
on the table was that sent by the British side at the end of 
last June and which rejected China's repeated claim that Beijing 
had sent its counter-proposals to the British side. "The ball 
is in China's court," a source said. 
  But a mainland official asserted: "We have made a set of 
proposals to the British about three months ago. 
  "They gave no response. Instead, it has time and again 
sought fundings [from the Legislative Council.] Aren't they 
going too far?" The official said that China remained committed 
to the confidentiality rule but it was considering whether to 
publicise its counter-proposals on the financial package, 
claiming that the Hong Kong Government had ignored their demands 
and blatantly violated the airport accord. 
  But the official also offered a note of conciliation, saying 
that China was willing to agree to relax the debt ceiling of $5 
billion outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the 
new airport plan, despite the tough statement issued by the 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod also stressed that 
the 
Government was ready to show further flexibility in altering it 
latest financing package to facilitate a final accord. 
  Expressing disappointment at China's statement that 
financial 
or legal obligations not approved by Beijing would be invalid 
after 1997. Sir Hamish, however said he was encouraged by 
remarks that China was still open to further talks in the Joint 
Liaison Group Airport Committee. 
  "In suggesting a meeting of the Airport Committee [last 
week] 
we did make clear at the time to the Chinese side that we were 
ready to show further flexibility," he said. 
  Although Sir Hamish fell short of elaborating what 
flexibility the Government might offer, sources said that the 
British side was prepared to consider further in creasing the 
level of equity injections, which stands at $45.3 billion under 
the third financing package into the airport and railway plans. 
  At present, Hong Kong's reserves already topped the $130 
billion mark, said a source. The sources last night rejected 
the DAB proposal as unrealistic even given Hong Kong's present 
financial strength. But DAB chairman Tsang Yok-shing will fly 
to Beijing today and forward their counter-proposal to Chinese 
authority, confident that China would accept the party's 
suggestion. 
  Chinese officials have repeatedly called on the Government 
to 
inject more funds to the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and 
MTRC [Mass Transit Railway Corporation] to reduce the debts 
level, especially in the light of the huge reserves the 
Government will accumulate in the run-up to 1997. 
  A mainland official, who preferred anonymity, said: "Our 
demand is reasonable. The Government is fully capable of 
increasing the fundings without any difficulty." 
  He said Beijing has clearly told the British side that they 
were "willing to negotiate" on the level of government 
borrowings adding the $5 billion ceiling laid down in the MOU 
"can always be negotiated". The official questioned the motives 
behind the insistence of the Government not to increase its 
level of injections in spite of the surge in reserves in the 
next few years. 
  "Certainly they will continue to make massive spendings. We 
will tacitly let them make some gains. But they have to have a 
responsible and reasonable attitude," he said. 
  The official said the Chinese side has already turned a 
blind 
eye to the previous fundings for the PAA because "we cannot 
simply let the PAA dissolve". "Now they are asking for another 
$4 billion. Just look at the items in the funding proposals such 
as navigation system. Are they so urgently needed?" he asked. 
  But a government source said yesterday that while the 
British 
side was prepared to consider further raising the capital 
injection from the $45.3 billion it proposed under the third 
financing package, such a position did not mean the extra 
investment should be unlimited. 
  In considering any further amount of capital injection, the 
Government had to assess its impact on the reserves and whether 
it would result in putting excessive funds to the two 
corporations, thus undermining their alertness in operating with 
proper financial disciplines, the source said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "How Can the Memorandum of Understanding on the </F>
Airport Project Be Tampered With?"] 
  [Text] A spokesman for the British Hong Kong Government 
issued a statement yesterday. It contained the following three 
points: First, it arbitrarily regarded the constantly soaring 
airport construction costs as "reducing costs" and having 
achieved "cost control." Second, it regarded the borrowings of 
the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway 
Corporation [MTRC] as conforming to the memorandum of 
understanding [MOU] on the airport project and the 45 billion 
dollar debts left to the special administrative region [SAR] as 
"not government borrowings." Third, it regarded all contracts 
unilaterally signed by the British Hong Kong Government, which 
straddle 1997 and which are not approved by the Chinese side, as 
conforming to the Basic Law and called for SAR government 
protection. 
  This is a blatant revelation of the British colonialists' 
fraudulent diplomatic tricks and serves as lively teaching 
material in modern bandit diplomacy. When signing agreements 
with Britain in the future, all governments should be more 
clever. They should first study clearly how the British 
Government has failed to keep its word in the past, how 
changeable it has been, and how it has perpetrated frauds, 
confounded black and white, and willfully tampered with or 
distorted agreements, lest they should be taken in. 
  In the joint declaration and the MOU on the new airport 
project, the British Government has made a commitment, namely, 
with regard to all matters straddling 1997 which require the SAR 
government to take responsibilities and fulfill obligations and 
which involve the transfer of power, China and Britain must 
first discuss and examine them, reach a consensus, and come to 
an agreement. How can it now say that, in the absence of 
agreement from the Chinese side, all contracts unilaterally 
signed by the British Hong Kong Government can go beyond 1997? 
If such is the case, is it not possible for the British Hong 
Kong Government to change the names of the governor as well as 
the Executive Council into the Hong Kong Administrative and 
Economic Corporation, and then sign a 53-year contract with 
Chris Patten to enable him to serve as general manager of the 
company. In this way, cannot the colonialist governor hang on 
in Hong Kong for a long time? If the chief secretary, financial 
secretary, and all departments at the secretariat, directorate, 
and bureau chief levels can be corporatized in the wake of the 
Legislative Council hastily passing the so-called "Corporate 
Regulations," and then the British Hong Kong Government signs 
contracts on all administrative posts without regard for the 
nationalities of those holding the posts and gives all of them 
enormously high salaries and unsupervised power, is it not 
possible to extend the British colonial rule forever? Will there 
still be China's sovereignty over Hong Kong to speak of by 1997? 
The British Hong Kong Government's theory that "the contracts 
straddling 1997 which it has unilaterally signed conform to the 
Basic Law" is, in fact, a British theory of unlimited 
sovereignty. It totally contravenes the principle of power 
transfer outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  The "theory of not government borrowings" is also quite 
preposterous. We should be thankful to the British Hong Kong 
Government for advocating at this moment the fallacy that "the 
Hong Kong Government itself does not incur debts" because it 
enables people to see clearly the motive behind the British Hong 
Kong Government move to suddenly change the "Airport Authority" 
laid down in the MOU into an "Airport Corporation." The secret 
is that the Airport Authority is still a framework of the Hong 
Kong Government and that, by changing the signboard and turning 
it into a corporation, the British Hong Kong Government can 
sidestep the clause that "government borrowing should not exceed 
5 billion dollars" as stipulated in the MOU. This is only a 
clumsy trick employed by a swindler to escape by a cunning 
maneuvering. Despite the changes, the "corporation" is still a 
variety of the Hong Kong government framework. The British Hong 
Kong Government still wholly owns its assets, works out its 
regulations as it pleases, and appoints its administrative 
personnel, and "the corporation can borrow as much as it wants." 
Unexpectedly, the British Hong Kong Government still says this 
is in keeping with the MOU and that "this is not government 
borrowing." Is this not a flagrant violation of international 
law? 
  According to international law, the transfer of power must 
include the transfer of all government assets. Otherwise, it is 
tantamount to tearing up an agreement on the transfer of power. 
The assets of the MTRC and the Airport Authority belong to the 
Hong Kong Government. When money is borrowed with these assets 
as collateral, it will certainly lead to changes in Hong Kong 
Government assets. This is the same as government borrowing 
because the Hong Kong Government must be responsible for the 
clauses on the borrowing by either making repayments itself or 
allowing the banks to confiscate the collateral. If the British 
Hong Kong Government deliberately creates a situation in which 
the project cannot be finished as scheduled and the MTRC and the 
Airport Authority are unable to repay debts, the SAR government 
must inject funds to repay the debts. Therefore, the Hong Kong 
Government's argument that "this is not government borrowing" is 
logically untenable. 
  Even according the existing common law, a parent company 
must 
implement a takeover agreement when the company rights are 
transferred to a new boss. It should not borrow a lot of money 
and use it up, still less should it regard the debts of a 
subsidiary as "having nothing to do with the parent company." 
The fact that the Hong Kong government spokesman has trampled 
the law to such an extent can only show that the Hong Kong 
Government is in the wrong in terms of legal principle and that 
it resorts to unilateral, reckless acts in looking for a way out. 
  In his statement, the Hong Kong Government spokesman has 
consistently evaded the most substantive issue, i.e. whether it 
is necessary to abide by the series of agreement reached between 
China and Britain. It will not do to quibble and make a scene 
by tampering with the MOU and quietly changing names, for it 
only serves to lay bare even more the evil intentions of the 
Hong Kong Government in failing to keep its word. It is clearly 
stated in the MOU on the airport project: "Debt in excess of 5 
billion dollars can only be incurred after both parties reach a 
consensus on the debt proposal." According to this clause, the 
British Hong Kong Government cannot borrow in excess of the 
amount for the airport project, nor can it borrow in excess of 
the amount in the name of its fully funded and controlled 
corporations. By refusing to take the correct path of making 
more capital injections, the British side cannot but come to a 
dead end.

  [Text] Hong Kong, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Local public 
figures here criticized the uncooperative attitude of the 
British and Hong Kong authorities on the construction of a new 
airport in Hong Kong and urged them to act in accordance with 
the spirit of the memorandum of understanding signed by Britain 
and China. 
  Commenting on the statement issued by the spokesman of the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the Chinese State 
Council Tuesday [25 January] this week on the Hong Kong new 
airport issue, sit Fung Shen, member of the Provisional Airport 
Authority (PAA) and a professor of the Hong Kong University, 
said the Chinese side has shown the utmost tolerance toward the 
British side on this subject. 
  The British and Hong Kong authorities time and again asked 
the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council to approve 
additional funds for individual airport projects before an 
overall financial plan on the airport construction was reached 
between the Chinese and British Governments, he said. 
  Echoed Sit's voice, another PAA member Shiu Sin-por said 
that 
now it's not a question of appropriation of funds for individual 
projects, but lacks an overall financial plan. 
  The Hong Kong Government failed to put forward a new plan 
since the third financial plan was turned down by the Chinese 
side. The delay of raising a new plan made it difficult to 
re-open another round of Sino-British talks on the airport 
issue, he said. 
  Legislator Tam Yiu-chung said, the Chinese side and future 
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong should not 
honor the contracts approved by the Hong Kong Government under 
the circumstance of no overall financial plan. 
  Fong Wong Dut-man, head of the Economic Group of the 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of 
the SAR, urged the Hong Kong Government to explain why the loans 
borrowed or lend by the PAA did not belong to the government 
loans as declared by the Hong Kong Government a few days ago, 
since the PAA is an organ entirely funded by the government. 
  In view of the funds recently sought by the PAA for works on 
government airport key projects, Fong said, the debt borrowed by 
the PAA and to be left over to the future government of SAR has 
exceeded 5 billion H.K. dollars (641 million U.S. dollars). 
  This runs counter to the stipulation provided in the 
memorandum of understanding, she added.

  [Text] Governor Chris Patten said yesterday he would delay 
introducing the second part of his electoral reform bill so 
China would have time to change its mind. On his return from 
London, where he secured the support of the Cabinet, Mr Patten 
reiterated Britain's will to resume talks with China. 
  But the British gesture was not greeted by the Chinese side. 
A senior official of Xinhua (the New China News Agency), Zheng 
Guoxiong, reiterated the call for the withdrawal of the whole 
Patten proposal as a prerequisite for China's return to the 
negotiating table. 
  Mr Patten said there was a pressing timetable for 
implementing legislation for the coming elections and a "step by 
step" approach would give room for further talks. Noting that 
the Chinese side had changed its mind at the opening of the 
bilateral negotiations early last year Mr Patten said: "It's 
giving the Chinese side the time, if they wish to take it, to 
have second or third thoughts." 
  Another reason for not moving the second and more sensitive 
part of the bill was due to the "legislative reality". "I don't 
think the Legislative Council would welcome it if, while they 
were considering this bill we were to bring forward another 
bill," Mr Patten said. 
  Responding to the Cabinet meeting decision, Mr Zheng said he 
was not surprised at all by its support for Mr Patten.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 24 (AFP)--Business in Hong Kong will 
suffer "considerable" costs if a more democratic political 
system is not put into place before the British colony's return 
to China in 1997, Governor Chris Patten's second in command said 
Monday [24 January]. 
  Chief Secretary Anson Chan told a Hong Kong General Chamber 
of Commerce luncheon that the kind of fair, impartial government 
that executives now take for granted in this bastion of free 
enterprise could vanish if reforms are not made soon. "If we 
were to abandon our efforts to achieve such arrangements, we 
would be retreating from honest administration and responsible 
government -- and the costs would be considerable," Chan said. 
"The business community could no longer be certain of a level 
playing field in which political patronage played no part," she 
added. 
  Patten's campaign to extend democracy ahead of 1997 has been 
cooly received by Hong Kong business leaders, who fear that 
China's angry response to the initiative will harm their 
corporations' bottom lines. Patten has put some of his reform 
proposals before the Legislative Council for passage into law 
next month, prompting Beijing to warn that British companies 
will bear the consequences of his actions. The governor was due 
back from an official visit to London on Tuesday.

<F P=106> ["Edited highlights" of speech by Chief Secretary Anson Chan </F>
Fang On-sang at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on 24 
January] 
  [Text] As Chief Secretary, I believe that the Government 
has four areas of responsibility in which it ought to help to 
promote our economic success. 
  Our first task is to ensure that Hong Kong continues to 
deliver a sound business environment. We know that during the 
transition to 1997 political change is inevitable. The 
Government can help the business community to meet this 
challenge through achieving the highest standards of policy and 
administration. 
  -- We must manage government finances in a way that delivers 
high-quality public services without stifling enterprise. 
  -- We must ensure that taxes remain simple and low and that 
government regulation is equitable and stable. 
  -- We must avoid arbitrary administration which creates 
uncertainty for investors and encourages corruption. 
  -- We must remain willing as a government to test official 
policies and proposals against "competition" from the 
Government's critics, just as business firms pit their products 
against their rivals. 
  Our second responsibility is closely linked to the 
Government's partnership with business and the community at 
large. 
  It seems to me vital for our future prosperity that business 
remains free to defend its own commercial interests. It is 
equally vital for our stability that the community continues to 
feel confident that its wider concerns are respected. 
  For this reason, we must put in place arrangements for the 
1994 and 1995 elections which will be fair and open and, at the 
same time, acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. 
  If we were to abandon our efforts to achieve such 
arrangements, we would be retreating from honest administration 
and accountable government, and the costs would be considerable. 
  -- The business community could no longer be certain of a 
level playing field in which political patronage played no part. 
  -- The community would no longer be sure that its best 
interests were paramount. 
  -- The legislature would no longer command the public 
support 
needed to challenge the mistakes and misdeeds of the 
administration. 
  You might well ask: does all this really matter? Can we not 
stick to arrangements which served us adequately for so many 
decades in the past? 
  The reality is that we have very little choice. For a start, 
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law require us to make 
constitutional changes. 
  The framers of those documents had the wisdom to see that 
our 
political institutions must develop to match the aspirations of 
a more sophisticated, more affluent and more educated community. 
They decreed that standing still was not an option. 
  -- Hong Kong today is a sophisticated and prosperous 
society. 
We have a highly educated, much traveled and well-informed 
community that wants to have a say on the way in which it is 
governed. 
  -- Hong Kong's business community now takes for granted a 
very high quality of public service, with particular stress on 
the Government's fair dealing and impartiality. These 
expectations can only be met convincingly when policy is debated 
in public by a credible and genuinely representative 
legislature, and government officials can be called to account 
for their conduct. 
  -- The international business community regards legislation, 
regulation and taxation as part of the total competitive 
environment. Governments are expected to take decisions in 
these areas through processes which command respect for their 
integrity and accountability. The political arrangements of the 
past would have looked increasingly unsatisfactory by these 
criteria. 
  I come now to our third responsibility. So far I have talked 
of partnership in broad terms. But I would like at this point 
to narrow my focus. 
  After 31 years as a civil servant, I am fully convinced of 
the importance of preventing the public sector from crowding out 
private enterprise. 
  I believe we have a duty to encourage as much commercial 
partnership between the Government and the private sector as 
possible. This principle is particularly important when it 
comes to creating the infrastructure which Hong Kong will need 
in the next century. 
  It would be very easy, given Hong Kong's unbroken record of 
annual economic growth and regular budget surpluses, for the 
Government to throw money at our infrastructural problems. 
  But we must resist any temptation to follow this route, even 
when politically it seems the attractive thing to do. Instead, 
we have to take forward our plans for the airport, for port 
development, for new road and rail transport facilities, in the 
most cost-effective way open to us. 
  For those projects which generate their own revenues the 
Government has to make a vigorous effort to find partners from 
the private sector to lighten the demands on the taxpayer by 
providing opportunities for the private investor. 
  -- Only in this way will we ensure that projects are subject 
to the full discipline of market forces. 
  -- Only in this way can we be sure that rates of return and 
quality of service are competitive by market standards. 
  The massive scale of the infrastructural projects which we 
will undertake in the next few years makes it even more 
imperative to see that they offer the community the best value 
for money. 
  Our fourth and our major responsibility is concerned with 
the 
most significant influence on our future: the resumption of 
Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
  I have taken up the post of Chief Secretary with no 
illusions 
about the complexity of the challenges which the transition to 
1997 must bring. I am, personally, totally committed to a 
successful transition. 
  Let me repeat my own conviction that the Joint Declaration's 
pledge of "one country, two systems" will create enormous new 
opportunities for Hong Kong, and for the business community in 
particular. But it is important that we work together to ensure 
that this concept can and will be implemented after 1997. 
  As I have mentioned earlier, both the Joint Declaration and 
the Basic Law decree that the resumption of sovereignty will be 
accompanied by the development of our political institutions 
providing for greater participation by Hong Kong people in 
managing their own affairs. 
  Both documents also provide that our social and economic 
systems, and our life-style, will remain basically unchanged. 
Indeed, they give firm undertakings to maintain: 
  -- The capitalist economic and trade systems previously 
practised in Hong Kong; 
  -- The status of a free port and the continuation of a free 
trade policy, including the free movement of goods and capital; 
and 
  -- The status of an international financial centre...and a 
freely convertible currency. 
  These, and the other pledges set out in the Joint 
Declaration 
and the Basic Law, provide me with the necessary reassurance to 
recommend Hong Kong as Asia's premier business location not just 
for the present but far into the future. 
  I am determined during my term as Chief Secretary to make a 
positive contribution to a successful transition. 
  No one needs to be reminded of the difficulties we have had 
during recent years. The transfer of sovereignty was always 
going to be a difficult enterprise, and one should not be 
surprised if there are some disagreements along the way. 
  But, if the present and the future sovereign powers disagree 
on some things, that is no reason to disagree on everything. 
Indeed, our record over the last two years has shown how much 
we and the Chinese Government can agree on, despite our 
difficulties. 
  Let me sum up. Hong Kong businessmen have an outstanding 
track record when it comes to delivering business success. The 
Government is determined to maintain the conditions which make 
Hong Kong the ideal place in which to live, work and invest. 
But we cannot do so on our own. We need to foster a 
constructive partnership, both with business and with the wider 
community. 
  We are already hard at work building the infrastructure 
which 
Hong Kong will need in the next century; particularly to 
maintain our ability both to assist and to profit from rapid 
economic growth throughout southern China and the coastal 
provinces. The Chinese Government has been very open about its 
own determination to preserve Hong Kong as a thriving centre for 
international business. 
  With these factors in our favour, we can together face the 
future with considerable confidence.

<F P=106> [By Li Ho-teh (2621 4421 1795): "In Exclusive Interview, </F>
British Representative to Joint Liaison Group Davis Says PWC 
Cannot Be Mentioned in Same Breath as JLG"] 
  [Text]An Agreement Can Be Expected at Next Meeting on 
Stonecutter's Navy Base 
  During an interview with Hong Kong journalists yesterday, 
Hugh Davis, chief representative of the British side of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG], who has been in Hong 
Kong for just four months to take up his new post, told our 
newspaper that the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region is only an organ of study and consultation for the 
Chinese side on the Hong Kong issue. It cannot be mentioned in 
the same breath as the JLG. 
  During the interview, which lasted an hour or so, Davis 
revealed that after two months of consultations, the Chinese 
side has agreed to discuss with the British side the draft 
regulations on the Airport Corporation. At the next experts 
meeting of the defense and security group, Davis was quite 
confident that the Stonecutter's Navy base issue will be 
resolved. But he also admitted that it was a mistake that the 
agreement reached between China and Britain on the Court of 
Final Appeal had not won the support of Hong Kong's Legislative 
Council [Legco]. However, such things often happened under a 
democratic system. 
<H5>  JLG Carrying Out "Underwater Activities" </H5>
  Sino-British relations have become strained due to the 
dispute over Hong Kong's political structure. It can be said 
that the JLG is the only British organ in contact with the 
Chinese side at present. But recently, the Chinese side has 
made active preparations for setting up a second stove--the PWC. 
The work and matters discussed by the PWC are almost the same 
as those of the JLG. Has the JLG changed its functions then? 
  Davis admitted that the work of the JLG has progressed 
slowly. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
JLG's function is to serve as a channel for communications 
between China and Britain. However, the PWC is only a research 
organ offering opinions to the Chinese side on matters affecting 
Hong Kong. Therefore, both cannot be mentioned in the same 
breath. 
  Davis emphasized that several international agreements, 
which 
had nothing to do with major issues, were adopted by the JLG at 
its 28th meeting last December. The Chinese representative told 
him that because of the political reform issue, it was hard for 
the meeting to make any progress. He described Sino-British 
relations at that time as being at the "tip of the iceberg." 
Even so, the JLG had still carried out some "underwater" 
activities. 
<H3>  Guo Fengmin Was Informed of the Allocation of Funds for the 
Airport on 15 December </H3>
  Referring to the new airport issue, Davis said he did not 
understand why the PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman said the day 
before yesterday that there had been no diplomatic contacts 
between China and Britain on this issue. He said that on 15 
December last year, he had personally informed Guo Fengmin of 
the airport fund allocation scheme, and, 10 days ago, Alan Paul, 
a member of the British side, had also presented a Legco 
document on the plan to the Chinese side, hoping that the 
Chinese side would discuss the issue with the British side or 
give its opinions. Even this week, he had also made telephone 
calls to the other side time and again, but the latter did not 
give a definite reply. 
<H3>  The Chinese Side Hints that a Meeting of the Airport 
Committee May Be Held in March </H3>
  Davis said he did not know when the airport committee 
meeting 
could be held, but disclosed that the Chinese side had agreed to 
discuss the draft airport regulations with the British side 
after a two-month consultation period. This indicates that the 
meeting could possibly be held in March. 
  However, are the differences between both sides too big to 
reach any agreement on the airport issue? Davis did not think 
so. He stressed that in any talks, there is room for both sides 
to take flexible measures. Therefore, the possibility that both 
sides may change their stand should not be ruled out. The most 
important thing is for the Chinese side to sit down and talk. 
  When asked whether this indicated that the British side 
might 
make concessions on this issue, Davis said it was unwise to say 
that one would make concessions before sitting at the 
negotiating table. 
  The Hong Kong Government will submit a bill on the Court of 
Final Appeal to Legco. An agreement has already been reached by 
the JLG on this bill, but it will not win the support of Legco 
and other legal institutions. When asked whether this had been 
erroneous assessment by the British side, Davis admitted that it 
had been a mistake. However, the possibility of a similar 
occurrence in the future could not be ruled out, he said. 
  He explained that under a democratic system, the 
orientation of the administrative authority can not definitely 
be endorsed by the legislative organ and the intentions of the 
Legislative Council could not be clearly foreseen. Although the 
British side believed that the agreement was not the best one 
and had told the Chinese side this, under a situation where the 
Chinese side was willing to talk, this was the only choice. In 
the end, however, the matter should still be decided by Legco. 
  On the issue of the definition of a permanent resident, 
which 
the Hong Kong people are worried about at present, Davis said 
this was a complicated and difficult issue. He was glad to see 
that the Chinese side had attached increasing importance to this 
issue recently. 
  He also said that both sides have agreed in principle that 
Laurence M. Y. Leung, director of the Immigration Department, 
will pay a visit to China. But the timing of his trip had not 
been decided. So far, no response to this had been received. 
  Although certain headway has been made in the last few 
rounds 
of meetings on the issue of the Stonecutter's Island navy base, 
which were held by the defense and security groups under the 
JLG, no agreement had yet been reached. However, Davis said an 
experts' meeting would be held very soon. If things go on 
smoothly, he was quite confident that an agreement would be 
reached. Both sides would bring their seals to the next meeting 
and be ready to sign the agreement. 
  When asked why he was so sure of this, Davis refused to give 
further details. He also refused to admit whether the British 
side had made any concessions on the size of the future 
Stonecutter's base for the People's Liberation Army. He only 
stressed that both China and Britain had the common intention of 
reaching an agreement. 
<H3>  Realizing Importance of Patience After Four Months in His 
New Post </H3>
  Having been in his new post for four months, Davis said he 
was still at a learning stage. His predecessor, Anthony 
Galsworthy, had advised him to be "patient." Now he had begun 
to realize the importance of being "patient." After taking up 
his new job, he also discovered the seriousness of his 
responsibilities, which have a bearing on the smooth transition 
of Hong Kong in the future. 
  The only thing that had disappointed him was the slow 
progress of the JLG's work. He said he would feel distressed if 
things continued to go on like this.

  [Text] Hong Kong and Chinese groups dealing with issues 
that may affect the rule of law after 1997 arc both complaining 
that their work is being hamstrung by the logjam in the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). 
  Both sides have called for the JLG to speed up its work. 
  The Government's International Law Division warns that it 
will run out of time to seal extradition treaties and other 
equally important international agreements. 
  The legal sub-group of the Beijing-appointed Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC) has found that some of Hong Kong's 
legislation that involves international treaties to which China 
is not a signatory will not be applicable after 1997 unless the 
JLG localises the laws. 
  A PWC member, Maria Tam Wai-chu said she hoped the JLG could 
speed up its work to facilitate discussion in the PWC or whether 
the existing British related laws complied with the Basic Law. 
China must grant approval before Hong Kong authorities can 
enter into lengthy negotiations with another country about 
treaties or agreements. Several rounds of talks are necessary 
before a deal can be tentatively struck and it must then be put 
before the Executive Council and the Chinese side in the JLG for 
final approval. 
  "We have reached the stage where all the programmes simply 
cannot be done in the remaining period of time," said the 
International Law Division's head, David Edwards. "It's simply 
not possible to do all the programmes in the time remaining and 
wouldn't be even if we poured in more resources. 
  "We are now beyond the point where, even if [the Chinese 
side] approved it all, we could finish." Mr Edwards said his 
division could possibly complete the extradition agreements if 
there was a breakthrough in co-operation with Chinese 
authorities at all levels of the negotiating process. "But it 
would have to be complete co- operation and I think it's pretty 
unlikely," said Mr Edwards, legal adviser in the JLG talks. "If 
the extradition treaties are not in force in 1997 there will be 
a gap in the law. In the area of extraditions, the SAR (Special 
Administrative Region) will not be able to return criminals from 
where they came, meaning Hong Kong could become a haven for 
undesirables. 
  "Extraditions are only one of the number of things we have 
to 
do. It will certainly not be possible now to finish off 
programmes that haven't even begun, such as reciprocal 
enforcement of judgments and mutual legal assistance, which are 
equally important." 
  The Government decided agreements with 18 to 20 countries in 
the region, North America and Europe would be essential for the 
territory to maintain international respectability and 
credibility. Mr Edwards predicted that necessary extradition 
agreements with at least six countries, or about one third of 
the total, would be left unresolved in 1997 at the present rate 
of progress. 
  In the area of extraditions the Government has not been able 
to even begin talks with 10 of these targeted countries, 
representing half the number on the priority list, because the 
Chinese side has not given the green light. Only three 
bi-lateral agreements for the surrender of fugitive offenders 
have been sealed - with the Netherlands, Canada and Australia - 
since the division began direct negotiations with Chinese 
approval in 1990. The agreements, binding under international 
law, will survive the territory's handover. 
  Until 1997, the territory will continue to exchange 
fugitives 
with about 90 countries under a legal framework tied to the 
British system. More than 30 suspected murderers, drug 
traffickers and organised criminals were last year extradited 
between Hong Kong and the United States, Sweden, Canada, New 
Zealand and Macao in what the Legal Department called "a banner 
year for international co- operation in fighting crime". 
  The other important international agreements even further 
behind schedule include reciprocal enforcement of judgments in 
law; the abolition of visas to streamline visits by Hong Kong 
businessmen and tourists to participating countries; mutual 
legal assistance, and investment promotion and protection. 
Senior government sources have blamed "the excruciatingly slow 
pace" of the Chinese side in the JLG for the lack of progress. 
Sources said that in some cases, requests to begin talks with 
other countries have been on the negotiating table for three 
years. "One can only assume [the Chinese] are connecting it 
with the Governor's constitutional reform proposals," said a 
government official. "But they can't possibly hurt the British 
by this. It can only hurt Hong Kong and its people." 
  The legal representative on the Legislative Council, Simon 
Ip 
Sik-on, said yesterday Hong Kong would be harmed by a failure to 
seal extradition agreements by 1997, but he believed there was 
still enough time. "Hong Kong could become a refuge for 
fugitives. Do we want to be a receptacle for fugitives? Of 
course not. If there is no agreement, the ends of justice will 
be defeated for both sides." 
  In Beijing, PWC member Ms Tam said she hoped the JLG could 
speed up its work on localisation of laws. She said the PWC 
legal sub- group had spent the weekend going over some of the 
Hong Kong laws to bring them in line with the Basic Law. One 
difficulty they encountered was how to localise those 
British-related laws to the future SAR since some involved 
international treaties in which Britain, but not China, was a 
signatory. One example was the Supreme Court Ordinance which 
had involved the Reine International Treaty in which China was 
not a signatory. 
  Ordinances which were at present extended from the United 
Kingdom acts, such as the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, had to be 
localised, she said. There were at least 100 similar cases 
which were under the discussion of the JLG. Ms Tam said she 
hoped that the diplomatic body could speed up its works. "As 
long as these problems remain unresolved, it will leave a 
crevice. It will become uncertain for us whether to wait for a 
conclusion from the JLG or go it alone by ourselves."

<F P=106> [By Louis Ng and David Wallen in London] </F>
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten should consider disbanding 
the Legislative Council [Legco] if it amended his political 
reform package in a way which represented a backward step in 
democratisation, leading liberal Martin Lee Chu-ming said 
yesterday. He said Mr Patten was constitutionally entitled to 
veto a law and dissolve the legislature. 
  Mr Lee, chairman of the United Democrats, claimed most of 
the 
appointed members in Legco had consistently acted against the 
wishes of the public. "After disbanding the council, he can 
appoint a new group of legislators who truly represent public 
views," he said. Mr Patten could then table the bill again and 
seek its approval. 
  Later, Mr Lee said that if Prime Minister John Major and the 
British Government "had any respect for the people of Hong Kong 
at all, they should introduce the bill containing Mr Patten's 
original reforms immediately". He said it would "wholly 
irresponsible and unacceptable" to delay any longer. 
  Replying to Mr Lee's suggestion, Mr Patten said: "We have to 
legislate with the Legco we've got, and I don't think I could 
very well say if this or that was amended in that case I would 
have to send for a new Legco. 
  "I don't think that would be regarded by the community as 
very fair." 
  The British Cabinet last night failed to take any decision 
on 
the tabling of the second section of Mr Patten's package but 
again urged China to return to the negotiating table and make 
concessions. Officials had earlier stressed that the meeting of 
the Hong Kong committee of the Cabinet chaired by Mr Major was 
aimed at taking stock of the impasse with China. 
  "No dramatic decisions have been considered or taken," said 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd as he emerged from the one-hour 
meeting in Downing Street. 
  "The first part of the legislation, what we hope would be 
the 
non-controversial part, is going through the Legislative 
Council," he said. 
  "No decisions have been taken yet on the timing or content 
of 
the second part." But he stressed: "That legislation needs to 
be in place by July this year in order that the preparations for 
the elections in 1994 and 1995 can be made in an orderly way. 
  "We are entirely ready to resume discussions with the 
Chinese 
on the points that remain in disagreement, but obviously there 
is a limit to the time which could be spent before legislation 
has to be tabled on the second part." 
  Mr Patten insisted that the Hong Kong Government had 
proceeded in an orderly way. "We have taken one legislative 
step after another, and obviously we will want to have the first 
bill on the statute book before moving on unless of course by 
that stage we have managed to resume discussions with Chinese 
officials," he said. 
  He refused to be drawn on whether the second tranche of 
legislation would be based on his original October 1992 proposal 
or the compromise cutting the functional constituency electorate 
put forward in the later rounds of talks. "We will obviously be 
deciding on what is the best way forward in the light of our 
success in getting the first bill through and other factors at 
the time," he said. This was not the appropriate occasion to 
make an announcement on the content of the bill. 
  He said he would want to take account of the views expressed 
in the community and by political groups in recent weeks. "We 
want to make sure that there is as broad a base of support as 
possible." He hinted that Britain had asked the US to raise the 
Hong Kong democracy issue in its current talks with the Chinese 
Government. "It would not be surprising if other countries 
expressed their concern over Hong Kong's system and the survival 
of rule of law," he said. The Governor added: "When approached 
by our friends, we tell them." 
  Mr Patten firmly denied any suggestion of division between 
himself and the Foreign Office on how to proceed. "I have never 
ever in my life been to a meeting at which views were more 
unanimously expressed," he said. 
  The United Democrats' own amendments on the coming partial 
electoral bill was ruled out of order by Legco President John 
Swaine. The amendments intended to increase the number of 
directly- elected seats to 30; to introduce the nine new 
functional constituency seats as mentioned in the original 
package proposed by Mr Patten and to create three new functional 
constituencies to give the retired and housewives a second vote.

<F P=106> ["Forum" column by Allen Lee, Liberal Party chairman, from </F>
the "Opinion" page: "Deliberate Distortions in an Increasing 
Propaganda War"] 
  [Text] Having taken the pulse of the rank and file, the 
Liberal Party last weekend diagnosed support for an amendment to 
the partial reform bill. Should that remedy fail, the party 
will support what is on offer. 
  Far from vacillating on the reform proposals, the party has 
arrived at its definitive decision through consultation as its 
members require of their leaders and as it is consistent with 
our political creed. 
  To reiterate for emphasis, let me say, the Party is seeking 
to separate the bill's provisions so that any reference to a one 
seat, one vote arrangement is confined to all the elected 
assemblies, other than the Legislative Council. This seems to 
be the only hope of keeping the doors to British and Chinese 
negotiations ajar. 
  Our members support lowering the voting age to 18 and 
allowing National People's Congress delegates to contest local 
elections. 
  Most of us have no quibbles with any specific point in the 
partial bill which is supposed to cover the least contentious 
aspects of the reform proposals as introduced by the Governor in 
October 1992. 
  What we oppose is any attempt to divide the community, the 
sabotage of British and Chinese cooperation, and turning our 
backs on 10 years of confidence-building in Hong Kong. 
  I am not crying wolf when I say there are groups and 
individuals in our midst who are agitating for confusion in Hong 
Kong and for a showdown between Britain and China. 
  What the Liberal Party and its friends must guard against is 
any attempt to undermine Hong Kong and its institutions. 
  Any reform must help our community through to 1997 and 
beyond 
rather than be an excuse for someone to usurp power, incite 
trouble, and another to claim dubious glory. The changes also, 
must serve a better end than the rewriting of electoral rules to 
spite the future sovereign. 
  Many have praised the architect of the reforms for his 
sincerity (just as many have done the opposite). But the world, 
as most of us can see, is strewn with the rubble of noble 
intentions. 
  Over the past year, since the reform proposals were 
introduced, I have seen with dismay deliberate distortions of 
words and meanings in a raging propaganda war in Hong Kong. 
  A Democrat nowadays urges the Governor to exercise his 
autocratic powers by disbanding the legislature if it voted 
against the reforms. Another equal rights advocate demands that 
retired civil servants be banned from private employment. A 
self-professed defender of Hong Kong interests is out and about 
worsening the dispute between Britain and China that will 
cost--and is costing-- Hong Kong. Tactics are now confused with 
principles which are these days treated as a commodity. 
  I know many in our society are not apathetic but are wary of 
politicians seen by them to be too suave and conniving. They 
have reason for their suspicion for, whenever they analyse the 
slogans and study the gestures, they find these statements empty 
and the baby-kissing routine boring. The public cannot be 
fooled all the time. 
  The Liberal Party could be posturing too and taking radical 
positions which always attract an audience. Pleading for talks, 
reconciliation and reason is never as easy to stumping for the 
opposite. 
  When weighing the merits of issues on logic, the politician 
has to become a statistician, an administrator, a doer and not 
an actor. The price of prudence is reservation. 
  How much simpler it would be to react on impulse, to be 
fanatical, self-righteous and be ready to blame someone else for 
failures. Doing so, however, would for me be an abdication of 
responsibility. 
  We must act carefully because the consequences of mistakes 
are so serious. 
  Now that the reforms have been thrust upon Hong Kong, the 
public has to treat the subject with calmness and a measure of 
skepticism. 
  The passion the community feels and the Liberal Party shares 
is for a better Hong Kong where the people can live in safety, 
stability and harmony with the future sovereign. 
  I find it deeply ironic that 10 years ago, we of Hong Kong 
were told by Britain to trust and work with the mainland 
Chinese--when we had few reasons to do so. Now, with so much 
contact, business in both directions, and travel also in both 
directions, we are suddenly asked by Whitehall and the Governor 
to resist and suspect people north of the Shenzhen River. How 
is that for confusion, cynicism or callousness?

<F P=106> [By David Wallen in London and Andy Gilbert] </F>
  [Text] Britain has submitted plans to build a military 
base in Malaysia to allow troops still to operate in the region 
following the withdrawal from Hong Kong. 
  The base at Mersing on the southeast tip of the Malaysian 
peninsula, is being linked to the controversial 243 million 
(HK$2.77 billion) aid package for the Pergau Dam power project, 
which a former British defense secretary has linked to a 1.3 
billion arms deal with the Kuala Lumpur Government. 
  There is also speculation that the base could become a new 
home for the General Communication Headquarters listening post 
at Chung Hom Kok near Stanley which is expected to close before 
the 1997 handover. 
  Chung Hom Kok is a key site for Britain's security 
establishment and has been used to eavesdrop on electronic 
communications throughout the region. 
  The SAS [Special Air Service], Britain's primary special 
forces unit, is based periodically in Hong Kong and is known to 
take part in jungle warfare exercises in Brunei and elsewhere in 
Southeast Asia. 
  The current Commander British Forccs in Hong Kong, 
Major-General John Foley, is intimately acquainted with both 
operations since before taking up his Hong Kong posting he was 
the director of the SAS Group and Deputy Chief of Defence 
Intelligence. 
  The SAS also has an antiterrorist role, and vetted security 
at Government House and Fanling Lodge before Governor Chris 
Patten, a potential target for the IRA, arrived in Hong Kong in 
1992. 
  The British Garrison currently around 8,000 troops and 
civilians, is set to decline dramatically this year. The 600 
soldiers of the Black Watch regiment leave this year, and 
Stanley Fort will be vacant by September. By the end of 1994 
the Garrison is expected to be 3,000 strong. 
  A spokesman for the Garrison said they had no knowledge of 
any plans to develop a base in Mersing. "Our only 
responsibility in the region is to Hong Kong, Brunei and Nepal," 
he said. "We do use Malaysia as training facility for British 
forces but that is in Sabah, at the other end of the country. 
  "In any ease, we would not expect to be routinely informed 
about government-to-government contracts." 
  John Laing International, the British construction company, 
said yesterday it had recently submitted a report with detailed 
plans to the Malaysian Government, but would not comment 
further. "It would be for the Malaysian Government to tell you 
about the report," said a spokesman. The Malaysian High 
Commission in Britain refused to comment on the deal but the 
Ministry of Defence in London confirmed that the original 
specifications were for barracks, infrastructure and electronic 
equipment. The specifications are also believed to include 
submarine docking facilities, a landing strip, and reinforced 
hangars for Hercules transport aircraft. 
  Mersing has existed as a military base since British rule in 
then Malaya but it will be almost entirely rebuilt under the new 
plans. As a signatory to the Five Power Defence Agreement with 
Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, Britain will be 
able to station troops there during joint exercises. Britain 
has close defence co-operation with Malaysia and officers are 
routinely seconded to Kuala Lumpur. 
  Mersing was first raised during the deal to finance a 1.3 
billion pounds British sale of arms to Malaysia in 1988 which 
included the purchase of Hawk fighters and two frigates. 
  A senior banker involved in arranging the finance of the 
deal 
was quoted yesterday as saying: "It was on a menu of 
transactions drawn up by the Malaysians. They'd selected a site 
and they wanted our help. It would be operated by the 
Malaysians but would contain our troops when Hong Kong goes."

<F P=106> ["Special article": "There Will Be a Major Personnel </F>
Reshuffle in the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office"] 
  [Text] There will soon be a major reshuffle among the 
Chinese officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs, as a 
supporting measure for the tough stand the central authorities 
are going to take on Sino-British relations. It is learned that 
Wang Fengchao, director of the Second Department of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office [HKMAO], will be promoted to the 
position of deputy director of the HKMAO, while Chen Zuoer, 
director of the First Department, will be transferred from 
Beijing to Hong Kong as a representative to the Sino-British 
Joint Liaison Group [JLG]. Besides, the Chinese side is 
carefully thinking over the retirement of Guo Fengmin, chief 
representative of the Chinese side to the JLG, and is 
considering choosing an appropriate official from the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs to take his place. 
  It is learned that when Sino-British relations went 
downhill, 
the HKMAO had an intense discussion among its officials on how 
to keep pace with the new circumstances. In the end, the 
hardliners gained the upper hand, followed by a series of 
personnel changes. Wang Qiren, former deputy director of the 
HKMAO, was earlier given an official promotion to the 
chairmanship of the Bank of China Group's board of directors. 
The vacancy he left behind will be filled by Wang Fengchao, 
director of the Second Department of the HKMAO, who has been 
responsible for Hong Kong's political and social affairs. 
  Wang Fengchao is about 50 years old. He studied in the 
Chinese Department of Beijing University and worked with 
LIAONING RIBAO as a journalist for some time. Later, he became 
a fellow at an institute of the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences and worked there for a period of time before moving on 
to the HKMAO. In 1992 he headed a delegation to Hong Kong and 
last year he attended the Sino-British talks on constitutional 
reforms in Hong Kong in the capacity of the Chinese side's 
adviser and expert. 
  Wang Fengchao's wife, Lei Yuping [7191 3254 1627], is one of 
the persons in charge of All-China Journalists' Association. 
They were classmates in the university and later got married. 
Wang's father-in-law is General Lei Yingfu [7191 5391 1133], a 
CPC celebrity. CPC leader Mao Zedong called Lei a "gifted 
scholar" during the Yanan period and held him quite close. 
  Chen Zuoer, former director of the First Department of the 
HKMAO responsible for Hong Kong's economic affairs who became 
widely known among the people of Hong Kong because of the talks 
on the new airport project, will be transferred from Beijing to 
Hong Kong as a Chinese representative to the JLG, taking the 
place of Luo Jiahuan who is currently holding this position. 
  The two vacancies Wang Fengchao and Chen Zuoer are to leave 
behind will be filled by the two deputy directors of their 
respective departments, namely, Xu Ze [1776 3419] and Zhang 
Lianglian [1728 5328 2808]. Chen Guangming [7115 1639 2494], 
another deputy director of the Second Department, will be 
transferred to Guangdong. 
  On the other front, the central authorities in Beijing are 
considering the retirement of 63-year-old Guo Fengmin, chief 
Chinese representative to the JLG. He will be succeeded by an 
appropriate person handpicked by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. It is learned that Zhao Jihua, director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, is among the 
candidates being considered.

March Toward the Mainland's Infrastructure Construction -- An

in 1993"] 
  [Excerpt] Hong Kong, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The economic 
exchanges and trade between Hong Kong and the mainland in 1993 
showed an upsurge of investment in the mainland's energy, 
transportation, and other infrastructure projects by Hong Kong's 
well-known consortiums. 
<H5>  Infrastructure Attracts Great Attention </H5>
  In October 1993, Hutchison-Whampoa, Ltd. of Hong Kong and 
the 
Shenzhen Dongpeng Industry Company, Ltd. jointly formed the 
Yantian International Container Terminal Company, Ltd. to build 
and manage the Yantian International Container Terminal. With a 
total investment estimated at greater than 5 billion yuan, the 
project is the largest joint venture in Shenzhen. On 5 October 
1993, Premier Li Peng met with Li Ka-shing, the richest person 
in Hong Kong and the president of Hutchison-Whampoa Ltd. Li 
Ka-shing was attending a signing ceremony in Beijing for the 
project. Premier Li Peng said during the meeting: China faces 
an increasing demand for transportation as its economy develops 
further, its door opens wider, and its foreign economic and 
trade activities increase. The mainland's use of foreign funds 
has been expanded to include the area of infrastructure, 
including ports, railroads, airports, and power stations. 
  Premier Li Peng's remarks have summed up from another angle 
the trend of Hong Kong businessmen's investment in the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--Strong Sino-Russian ties are 
of paramount importance in ensuring stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region and defusing potential regional conflicts, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said here Thursday. 
  Kozyrev, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit, 
gave a speech at the Chinese Institute of Diplomacy following 
talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen. 
  While the danger of major regional conflicts is "less than 
at 
any time since World War II," potential flashpoints still exist, 
Kozyrev said in his speech, citing an upsurge in religious 
extremism in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. 
  Beijing is particularly concerned that Islamic activists in 
Tajikistan will fuel unrest in the bordering Chinese region of 
Xinjiang which has a Moslem-majority population. 
  Kozyrev also warned of the danger of clashes as countries 
moved to exploit natural resources in the Pacific, an apparent 
reference to the oil-rich area around the Spratly islands that 
are claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, the 
Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. 
  As permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia and 
China should work together to help promote the denuclearisation 
of the Korean penninsula and to control nuclear proliferation in 
the region, Kozyrev said. 
  He also proposed the establishment of a regional forum for 
discussing disputes. 
  Russia recognises that constructive ties with China "have a 
strategic importance in Asia and the Pacific," he added. 
  After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning 
of 
the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in 
1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Boris 
Yeltsin came to power in 1991, the neighbouring countries have 
enjoyed strong military cooperation. 
  During his talks with Qian, Kozyrev said the strengthening 
of 
bilateral relations would remain a "top priority" and would not 
be affected by domestic political upheavals in Russia. 
  The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of 
"sincere and cordial" talks on bilateral and international 
issues, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said, adding that 
one hour of the talks was held in private. 
  No details were given of their closed-door session. 
  According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts 
over the past year, as well as Yeltsin's visit here in December 
1992, had lent "great impetus" to the development of 
Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links. 
  Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7 
billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5 
billion dollars. 
  Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement 
for regular consultations on the establishment of "transit 
ports" along their 4,500 kilometer (1,800-mile) common border. 
Around 20 such ports are currently in operation. 
  During his speech later in the day, Kozyrev welcomed China's 
participation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum summit in Seattle in November, and he called on China to 
help Russia integrate fully in the regional economy. 
  Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to 
participate in several large-scale construction projects in 
China, including the massive Three Gorges hydro-electric dam 
being built on the Yangtze River. 
  Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Premier Li Peng and 
President Jiang Zemin tomorrow before leaving for a tour of the 
southern Chinese special economic zone of Shenzhen.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here today that it is 
Russia's "unchangeable policy" to bolster a good-neighborly, 
friendly and cooperative relationship with China. 
  He made the remark at a press conference this morning. 
  Kozyrev noted that he had had specific, friendly talks with 
Chinese leaders and both sides hold that a long-term bilateral 
relationship, which would not be affected by political changes, 
should be established. 
  He also answered questions relating to Russia's diplomacy 
and 
domestic reforms. 
  Yesterday, the Russian foreign minister delivered a speech 
here on Russian-Chinese relations, international issues and 
Russia's foreign policy. 
  Kozyrev and his party are scheduled to head for Shenzhen 
city, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong 
Province, this afternoon.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin met here today with visiting Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Welcoming Kozyrev, Jiang said that "the whole year's work 
depends on a good start in spring." Kozyrev's current visit 
symbolizes a good beginning for Sino-Russian relations in a new 
year. 
  Jiang said that President Boris Yeltsin's China visit in 
December 1992 was "very successful", adding that the bilateral 
ties witness steady growth on the basis of mutual respect, 
equality and mutual benefit. 
  He noted that to maintain and further the good-neighborly 
and 
friendly relations with Russia is an unswerving policy of the 
Chinese Government. 
  The Chinese side cherishes the hard-won cooperative 
relations 
of good neighborliness between China and Russia, Jiang said, 
hoping that the two nations and their peoples could live in 
harmony from generation to generation, which is in accord with 
the fundamental interest of the two peoples and conducive to the 
peace and stability of the region and the world. 
  Kozyrev conveyed a personal letter and greetings of Yeltsin 
to Jiang. 
  In the letter, Yeltsin again invited Jiang to visit Russia. 
Jiang, thanking for the invitation, said that he would pay a 
visit to Russia in due course. He also asked Kozyrev to pass on 
his regards to Yeltsin. 
  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, Chinese 
Ambassador 
to Russia Wang Jinqing, and Russian Ambassador to China Yegor 
Rogachev took part in the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng met with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and his party, at Zhongnanhai, here today. 
  Welcoming Kozyrev and his party, Li said that the policies 
of 
good neighborliness, friendship, mutual benefit and cooperation, 
set by Chinese and Russian leaders during President Boris 
Yeltsin's China visit in 1992, are "correct". 
  These policies conform to the essential interests of the two 
countries and the two peoples and should be adhered to. 
  On Sino-Russian ties, Li said that the bilateral relations 
had a fairly long history. The two countries share long borders 
which should be peaceful and friendly ones. 
  He said that the economies of the two sides are 
complementary, adding that Sino-Russian economic and trade 
relations have experienced rapid development. 
  The trade volume between China and Russia reached 7.6 
billion 
U.S. dollars last year, which is less than four percent of the 
total Chinese foreign trade value in 1993. 
  Li said that both China and Russia should take practical 
views to explore new ways for further bilateral cooperation. 
Relevant departments of the two sides should promote contacts 
and conduct some large-scale cooperation. 
  Li, on behalf of the Chinese Government and in the name of 
himself, invited Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to 
visit China. 
  Kozyrev expressed gratitude for Li's invitation. He said 
that the invitation from President Yeltsin to Premier Li for a 
future Russia visit was still valid, adding that an early 
meeting between Russian and Chinese prime ministers will be 
"very important". 
  Kozyrev said that Russia is willing to acquire a in-depth 
understanding of China's economic reform experience. He himself 
will also tour south China's Shenzhen city to this end. 
  Li said: "The national conditions in China and Russia are 
not the same; China's practice is for reference only to your 
country." 
  Noting that Russia is rich in natural and human resources, 
Li 
said he believed that the Russian people will overcome the 
temporary difficulties. China wishes to see a stable Russia 
with a growing economy, he added. 
  Li also briefed the Russian guests on China's foreign 
policies. He said that after the Cold War, the world is facing a 
multi-polarization trend. Yet the world is not peaceful. New 
conflicts and contradictions keep occurring. The gap between 
the north and the south is further enlarged, Li said. 
  Kozyrev said that the world is not single-pole nor 
bi-polarized but multi-polarized. 
  In this changing world, Kozyrev said, to improve 
Russian-Chinese ties is a top priority in his country's foreign 
affairs. He said that the constructive partnership between the 
two sides should be enhanced and reach new heights. 
  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, Chinese 
Ambassador 
to Russia Wang Jinqing, and Russian Ambassador to China Yegor 
Rogachev participated in the meeting.

  [Text] Moscow, January 27 (XINHUA) -- President Boris 
Yeltsin will not put up with any retreat from reform by paying 
lip service only, an official said here today. 
  Yeltsin's Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the 
statement soon after Boris Fyodorov, a major reformer in the 
cabinet, resigned as finance minister with a warning of economic 
collapse and social unrest. 
  In an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, Kostikov 
said 
that Yeltsin will watch closely any changes taking place in the 
government. 
  Once President Yeltsin finds any divergence from reform in 
the work of the new cabinet, he will stop it with his 
constitutional powers, Kostikov noted.

<F P=106> ["Year-End Report" by reporter Zhu Chengjun (4555 2110 </F>
6511): "Relations Among CIS Nations Are Still Evolving" -- 
XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing 18 Dec (XINHUA) -- It has been two years 
since the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
[CIS]. This year, various CIS nations have experienced 
difficulties and frustrations to varying degrees, resulting in 
changes in the relations among the members. 
  For quite some time, generally, the economies of the CIS 
member nations have had many problems, with serious production 
setbacks. While some nations have experienced prolonged war, 
political instability, and fierce internal struggles, others 
have been mired in nationality and territorial disputes. 
Confronting all sorts of real-life, serious difficulties, CIS 
nations are adjusting their own policies. If seeking their own 
futures soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union had 
been the main goals of various CIS nations last year, this year 
should be the one during which they gradually regain their 
consciousness "from the intoxication of going their own way" and 
start exploring new cooperative means among themselves in a bid 
to overcome political, economic, and social crises. 
  The signing of the "CIS Constitution" among leaders of seven 
nations, including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, in Minsk 
in January this year, that binds all member nations, signified a 
temporary end to the year-long CIS "uncertainties." In May, 
leaders of nine CIS nations signed in Moscow a declaration on 
the establishment of an economic alliance among CIS nations. 
The declaration explicitly called for the setting up of a CIS 
common market where there will be a free flow of merchandise, 
labor services, capital, and labor forces within the unified 
economic area. Ukraine did not sign the "CIS Constitution" but 
signed all documents from that meeting. In September, leaders 
of nine nations further signed the CIS Economic Alliance Treaty, 
under which member nations will grant each other the 
most-favored-nation treatments and formulate a unified credit 
policy. Although their actual implementation remains 
considerably distant and the possibility of future changes is 
not excluded, the declaration and the treaty they signed 
reflected the urgency and wishes of the contracting nations in 
seeking cooperation. 
  In the military field, the relatively prominent feature for 
this year has been the CIS August decision to establish a 
unified defense force in Tajikistan, consisting of troops from 
five nations -- including Russia and Kazakhstan -- to jointly 
deal with the opposition armed forces in Tajikistan and the 
Afghan guerrillas along the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. 
Russia has played an important role in establishing this 
unified force. 
  In addition, what is worth mentioning is that, with the 
addition of Azerbaijan and Georgia in the latter part of this 
year, the number of CIS members will reach 11. 
  Factors leading to the formation of the trend of cooperation 
within the CIS have been many and varied. Despite CIS nations' 
desire for independence, the political, economic, and defense 
relations among them, developed over a long period, are 
difficult to cut off. They are well aware that relying on the 
Western developed countries to solve important economic, 
nationality, and territorial issues will be difficult, and that 
the CIS is needed to solve them. Georgia's final change of 
attitude and application for CIS membership was an obvious 
example, as it has to rely on other CIS nations, Russia in 
particular, for the supply of natural gas, petroleum products, 
materials, and merchandise. It also has to pin its hopes on CIS 
military and political support in solving conflicts in Abkhazia. 
Meanwhile, Russia has taken advantage of its military and 
economic strength as well as its vast superiority in resources 
to intensify diplomatic activities among other CIS nations. 
Russian leaders have openly repeated that Russia has its own 
strategic interests in certain CIS nations and have exerted 
influence over the development of certain local events. 
  However, as the CIS itself is a product of the drastic 
change and integration of the Soviet Union, relations among 
member nations are bound to be complex. Currently, wars in the 
Transcaucasus have not ended, with bloody conflicts reported 
here and there, while Azerbaijan and Armenia still see each 
other as enemies. Ukraine, a European country, and Russia 
remain widely divided over the handling of nuclear weapons and 
the Black Sea Fleet. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia 
decided to issue their own currencies in November this year 
after rejecting Russia's conditions, forcing the near 
abandonment of a proposal by six CIS nations in September for 
establishing a new type of ruble zone. Some foreign forces have 
also taken advantage of the situation to intensify infiltration 
and instigation. All of this shows that there will be 
contradictions, difficulties, and struggles among CIS nations in 
the process of cooperation. 
  Overall, CIS nations, while preserving their independence, 
are looking for closer cooperation. How to handle 
contradictions arising from the clash of these two tendencies 
will remain an acute issue they must face. With certain major 
domestic and foreign policies needing adjustment, the 
development prospects for many countries have not been clear, 
adding further complexities to the relations among CIS nations.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Moriyasu Okazaki; received via Nikkei </F>
Telecom Database] 
  [Text] A bureau chief of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry who recently visited Taiwan has spoken of his 
intention to effect visits by cabinet members to Taiwan, and 
moves concerning this are afoot in Japan to invigorate 
intergovernmental exchanges between Japan and Taiwan. 
Commenting on 25 December on these moves in Japan, a top 
Chinese Foreign Ministry official expressed unhappiness with the 
moves, saying, "Some forces in Japan are instigating matters." 
The same Chinese official also asked Japan to deal with the 
issue of promoting exchanges with Taiwan "solemnly, cautiously, 
and properly," in line with the principle established by China 
and Japan when they normalized their diplomatic relations. 
  Some Japanese Government officials are bitterly complaining 
about Japan's restrictions on travel by high-ranking government 
officials to Taiwan, citing visits by high-ranking European and 
U.S. government officials to Taiwan. Touching on the bitter 
complaints, the top Chinese Foreign Ministry official said: 1) 
France and the United States have gone beyond the limit, thereby 
adversely affecting their relations with China, and their 
excesses have become a diplomatic issue. Japanese-Chinese 
relations are now extremely good, and there is no need for the 
two countries to do anything that could adversely affect their 
relations, and 2) There are the issues of exchanges between 
Japan and Taiwan and the past history between Japan and China. 
Japan's expansion of exchanges with Taiwan may hurt the 
feelings of the Chinese people. 
  The same PRC official said that China is looking forward to 
the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata to 
China for two days from 8 to 9 January, and he expressed the 
hope that Prime Minister Hosokawa will visit China as soon as 
possible next year. The PRC official also added that China is 
examining the possibility of having one or two party and 
government leaders visit Japan next year.

here disclosed on 14 December that Deng Xiaoping, China's most 
influential leader, left Beijing for Shanghai on 10 December. 
The source stated that during his stay in Shanghai, Deng will 
start working out plans to reshuffle top military personnel. 
The military leadership reshuffle was originally expected to 
take place in mid- December, but it has now become most likely 
that the reshuffle will take place after next February. 
  Every year, Deng spends the season of the year's end and the 
new year as well as the Lunar New Year (which falls on 10 
February) in Shanghai partly for the purpose of passing the 
winter. Citing as the basis for his observation that Deng has 
arrived in Shanghai, the same source points out that the Xijiao 
Guesthouse where Deng usually stays and its neighboring area 
have been put under stricter guard than usual. 
  Moreover, an informed source in Hong Kong states that 
"Deng's 
movements have become slower than before" but that "there are no 
problems with his health because his thinking is clear and he 
has a nimble mind." At the same time, the same source points 
out that because senior military leaders are accompanying him on 
his current visit to Shanghai, it can be expected that plans for 
the military leadership reshuffle are being worked out now.

<F P=106> [By reporter Teng Mei-ling (6772 5019 3781): "Beijing </F>
University Teacher and Student Issue a Letter of Appeal Jointly 
Signed by People From All Walks of Life, Calling for an End to 
Encroachment of Civil Rights"] 
  [Text] Yuan Hongbing, deputy director of the Beijing 
University Law Department Procedural Law Teaching and Research 
Office, and Wang Jiaqi, a postgraduate law student specializing 
in handling cases wherein ordinary people have gone to law 
against government institutions, yesterday made public a letter 
of appeal signed by people from all walks of life, demanding 
that public security organs take measures to stop the occurrence 
of any events which encroach on citizens' interests and personal 
dignity. The letter of appeal was signed by 350 people and 
involved the largest number of people to sign a petition since 
the 4 June incident in 1989. The signatories include many 
prodemocracy activists. 
  The petition was sparked by the following event. On 2 July 
1992, Yan Zhengxue, "head" of an artist's village near Yuan Ming 
Yuan, who is also a deputy to the Jiaojiang City People's 
Congress, Heilongjiang, was involved in a dispute with a bus 
conductor. He was then detained by the public security organ of 
Beijing's Haidian District and was attacked by the security 
officers with electric batons. Yan later brought an 
administrative suit against the public security office, 
demanding that the public security organ be charged with such 
illegal behavior. 
  The letter of appeal pointed out that if a deputy to the 
people's congress could be treated in such a rude way, then 
ordinary people would be less protected. The letter of appeal 
supported Yan Zhengxue's suit and demanded that the authorities 
act in accordance with the laws and that the law courts try 
cases independently and affix responsibility to those who should 
be blamed. The signatories will continue to pay close attention 
to the development of the event. 
  The petition was caused by a dispute between the police and 
civilians and it was on the largest scale since the 4 June 
incident. The petition signatoriess included scholars, artists, 
reporters, lawyers, workers, cadres, members of the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, and ordinary people. Such 
prodemocracy activists as Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and "Peace 
Charter" members Liu Nianchun and Zhou Guoqiang also signed the 
letter. 
  The appeal letter was drafted in August 1993 but, as the 
drafters said, in order to prevent further complicating the 
event, they did not make it public. However, as the authorities 
did not take action to correct the wrong, and even continued to 
threaten Yan, they were forced to make public the letter and 
submit it to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, 
the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's 
Procuraterate.

  [Text] Jerusalem, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- 'Oded Ben-'Ami, 
adviser to Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Rabin, 
announced here today that Rabin had accepted the recommendation 
from Israeli military authorities and gave the Israeli Air Force 
his concurrence to purchase U.S.-made F15-I jet fighters. 
  The F15-I jet fighter, manufactured by the U.S. Lockheed 
Aircraft Company, is a model of the F15-E which the company 
builds especially for Israel. Many consider the F15-E the most 
advanced jet in the world today. 
  Ben Ami said purchasing the F15-I fighters will improve the 
"qualitative superiority" of the Israeli Air Force. 
  It was reported that before Rabin made his decision, Israel 
compared the costs, capabilities, and other aspects of candidate 
planes in accordance with Israel's defense needs. Among the 
candidates were McDonnell's naval aircraft -- the F/A18 Hornet 
-- and Lockheed's F-16 double-seat fighter, with the latter 
being more favored. 
  When U.S. President Clinton met with Rabin in Washington 
last 
October, he said the U.S. Government would consider exporting 
F15-E's to Israel; he also agreed to transfer the technology, 
which was unprecedented. In November, Clinton wrote to Rabin 
indicating he supported the project.

(0917 0500 1730): "Municipal Leaders Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, 
Others Salute Financial, Tax Workers"] 
  [Excerpts] On New Year's Eve, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing; and other 
municipal leaders visited the brightly illuminated municipal 
people's bank of China, tax bureau, and finance bureau to 
express thanks and to salute the cadres, staff members, and 
workers who were working hard all night to make year-end final 
accounts. 
  Although the price hikes for energy resources and raw 
materials were higher than in previous years and enterprises 
encountered fund shortages for some time, Beijing's revenues 
totaled 8.41 billion yuan in 1993, 0.7 percent higher than the 
municipal budget and 4.8 percent higher than in the preceding 
year, thus achieving a revenue increase for 11 years in a row. 
All tax revenues surpassed those of the preceding year, of 
which industrial and commercial tax totaled 14.48 billion yuan, 
up 31.5 percent from the preceding year in terms of comparable 
standards. Bank savings deposits in the municipality increased 
by more than 30 billion yuan, and loans by more than 20 billion 
yuan. 
  Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, and Executive Vice Mayors Zhang Baifa 
and Wang Baosen came to the municipal people's bank of China to 
hear its Governor Lu Xueyong's report and cordially meet with 
leaders of various specialized banks and insurance companies in 
an atmosphere characterized by festive joy and busy work. 
[passage omitted] 
  After this, Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, and others came to the 
municipal tax bureau to hear its Director Sun Zhiqiang's report. 
According to initial statistics, the municipality's tax revenues 
totaled 23 billion yuan in 1993, of which 13.5 billion yuan was 
local tax revenues, up 3.2 billion yuan, or 31 percent, from the 
previous year. The municipal leaders extended thanks and 
saluted the cadres, staff members, and workers of tax 
departments who had worked hard. Chen Xitong said: Tax 
departments fulfilled their 1993 tasks successfully. They 
should continue efforts in 1994 and take greater steps. They 
should remember that "development is the essential criterion," 
and that without a developed economy, there is no hope for tax 
collection. Tax work should be focused on promoting production. 
Only when "there is a way to create wealth," will there be "a 
way to accumulate wealth," and will there be financial resources 
for economic construction. Li Qiyan said: The overfulfillment 
of the 1993 tax tasks by tax departments despite numerous 
difficulties should be attributed to the concerted efforts of 
their cadres, staff members, and workers. It is hoped that in 
the new year they will exert greater efforts to train cadres 
well. Wang Baosen said: As the tasks of tax reform in the new 
year will be very heavy, it is hoped that continuous efforts 
will be made to win greater achievements. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The three-day provincial public security, 
procuratorial, and judicial work conference ended in Harbin 
today. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
gave a speech at the closing ceremony, entitled "Conscientiously 
Implement the Strategic Principle of Taking a Two-handed 
Approach, and Realistically Strengthen the Party's Leadership 
Over Public Security, Procuratorial, and Judicial Work." 
  The year 1993 witnessed great progress in the province's 
public security, procuratorial, and judicial work. The 
province's public security, procuratorial, and judicial front 
strengthened the struggle against the hidden front, dealt 
effective blows to the infiltration and sabotage activities of 
hostile forces and hostile elements inside and outside the 
territory, dissolved lots of social contradictions, effectively 
safeguarded a situation of political and social stability in the 
whole province, unceasingly conducted a series of special 
struggles against serious criminals, maintained a trend of 
fighting criminal activities, promoted comprehensive management 
of public security, and created a fairly stable social 
environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction in 
the entire province. Public Security, procuratorial, and 
judicial organs at all levels conscientiously investigated and 
handled major and appalling cases, strictly punished a number of 
corrupt elements, and promoted the development of the 
anticorruption struggle. They gave full play to their 
functional role of regulating relations in various economic 
sectors, actively participated in operation and management, 
provided good legal services for reform, opening up, and 
economic construction, enlarged the degree of reforming the 
public security, procuratorial, and judicial work, strengthened 
all sorts of measures for building ranks of public security 
personnel, and achieved noticeable progress in this regard. 
  In his speech, Secretary Sun Weiben fully affirmed our 
province's achievements in public security, procuratorial, and 
judicial work during the past year. He said: Under the new 
situation of accelerating the pace of reform, opening up and 
modernization, the tasks undertaken by the public security, 
procuratorial, and judicial front will be more glorious but 
heavier. Party committees and governments at all levels should 
pay great attention to public security, procuratorial, and 
judicial work, realistically strengthen leadership over this 
work, place it on the agenda, and grasp it firmly. Party and 
government leaders at all levels, and party and government top 
leaders, in particular, should conscientiously analyze all 
destabilizing factors, adopt effective measures, and try by all 
possible means to safeguard political stability. 
  Sun Weiben stressed: In this year's provincial public 
security comprehensively management work, we should make major 
breakthroughs in dealing blows to criminal offenses, controlling 
the crime development trend, pooling social efforts to guard 
against crimes, giving priorities to improving public security, 
and organizing the masses to prevent crimes and improve public 
security. Special efforts should be made to firmly grasp the 
work of dealing blows to criminals, which is the major aspect of 
the public security comprehensive management work, be determined 
to solve the problem of failing to enforce law strictly, enhance 
the strength, quality and effect in dealing blows, 
conscientiously grasp routine work of dealing blows and handling 
cases, suit measures to local conditions, conduct special 
struggles in a timely manner, resolutely deal blows to murder, 
robbery, and other criminal cases, stabilize the public security 
situation, and provide an environment of leading a secure and 
happy life for the masses of people. In the course of dealing 
blows, we should particularly stress the necessity of raising 
the ability to tackle difficult problems, pay attention to 
studying the regular pattern and characteristics of criminal 
offenses under the new situation, and purposefully adopt 
fighting and preventive measures. Sun Weiben called on party 
committees to lead, support, and coordinate with the public 
security, procuratorial and judicial departments, concentrate 
efforts on strictly investigating and handling major and 
appalling cases, including the criminal cases of legal persons 
and departments, particularly strengthen investigation and 
handling of criminal cases on bending the law for the benefit of 
relatives and friends, corruption, and bribery, and economic 
criminal cases on disrupting the economic order of the party and 
government leading organs, judicial departments, and 
law-enforcing administrative departments. We should 
realistically do a good job in building ranks of public security 
personnel, give full play to the fighting ability of public 
security, procuratorial, and judicial departments, set example 
in observing the Constitution and laws, resolutely check and 
prevent the phenomena of regarding one's words as law, abusing 
one's power to make one's own law, and disrupting law 
enforcement. 
  At the end of his speech, Sun Weiben said: The hosts of 
heroic and moving deeds emerged on the public security front 
must be actively publicized and commended. We should let the 
broad masses of people and all social sectors to fully 
understand their bitterness, sadness, loftiness, and greatness 
in an effort to cultivate a brilliant image of the public 
security cadres and policemen, and the lofty status of the 
public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments in the 
hearts of the mass of people. 
  At the conference, provincial leaders, including Zhou 
Wenhua, 
Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, Yu Jingchang, Qi Guiyuan, Xie Yong, 
Zhou Tienong; and Tang Xianqiang, president of the provincial 
Higher People's Court; Yu Wanling, chief procurator of the 
provincial People's Procuratorate; and Xu Yandong, deputy 
secretary of the provincial Commission on Politics and Law of 
the provincial party committee, presented citation plaques and 
certificates to the awarded pace-setters who took up the cudgels 
for a just cause, advanced units and individuals outstanding in 
comprehensively improving public security, and advanced units 
and collectives outstanding in the struggle of dealing blows to 
criminals.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Xu Yaozhong (1776 
5069 0022)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- In a speech at a 
national work conference on the "vegetable basket," grain, 
cotton, and edible oil, State Council Premier Li Peng stressed: 
The bounden duty of governments at all levels is to keep in 
mind the immediate and vital interests of the broad masses. 
Ours is a people's government, and the aim of the people's 
government is to serve the people wholeheartedly. He urged that 
governments at all levels make caring for the people and 
improving their living standards the first and most important 
task. 
  The two-day national work conference, convened by the State 
Council, closed in Beijing this afternoon. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji presided over today's meeting. 
  Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang, 
Shanghai 
Mayor Huang Ju, Vice Mayor Jin Mingshi of Shenyang, and Vice 
Mayor Zhou Jianzhong of Chongqing spoke at the conference. 
  After hearing the speeches, Premier Li Peng said: The 
current situation of the production and market supply of farm 
products as a whole is good. We have reaped good harvests for 
several years in a row and have achieved notable results in the 
"vegetable basket" project. The total supply of farm produce, 
and food in particular, has become relatively abundant in China 
as compared with the chronic shortages of the past. 
  He said: Despite the excellent situation, fluctuations in 
the 
market prices of grain, oil, and sideline products occurred in 
some localities during a period from November last year. The 
problem has been caused by various factors, the most important 
of which, I believe, is our failure to thoroughly understand the 
continued need to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control 
over the market under the new situation arising from price 
decontrol. The purpose of the current conference is to achieve 
unity in thinking and understanding, and to draw on experiences 
and lessons for further solving the problem of making the 
"vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil work meet the 
requirements of a socialist market economic structure. 
  Premier Li Peng discussed questions in five aspects: 1) 
Caring for the people and improving their living standards is 
the first and most important task of governments at all levels; 
2) ensuring a sufficient supply of goods and establishing a 
larger distribution and circulation pattern; 3) building up and 
managing markets well; 4) strictly enforcing macro-economic 
regulation and control; and 5) further implementing the mayor's 
responsibility system. 
  Li Peng said: In our historical advance toward becoming a 
modern socialist power, we should attach great importance to 
both feeding the people and economic construction, and properly 
handle the relationship between the two. Feeding the people, 
which means caring for and improving their life, is a major task 
of governments at all levels. We must bear in mind this major 
task in unifying our thinking and understanding, striving to do 
a good job in the "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible 
oil work and ensuring ample supply and relatively stable prices 
in the market. He said: As current incomes of most rural and 
urban residents are still relatively low and food expenses are 
much higher than for other consumer goods, the prices of staple 
foods, including grain, oil, meat, and vegetables, can directly 
influence consumption standards. To effectively solve problems 
in the production and supply of vegetables, grain, cotton, and 
edible oil is a matter of grave importance, which should never 
be treated lightly. 
  Li Peng pointed out: This will be a year in which our 
country will take a giant step forward in instituting major 
reform measures. The successful implementation of these major 
reform measures has a bearing on whether the reform can succeed 
and on the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. The smooth progress of reform requires that we 
maintain social stability and set people's minds at ease. We 
must make great efforts to maintain relatively stable commodity 
prices in the marketplace, particularly the prices of grain, 
edible oil, meat, vegetable, and eggs; and we must make great 
efforts to strengthen and develop the current social stability 
and unity; and correctly handle the relationship between reform 
and development on the one hand and stability on the other. 
  He said: In deepening reform, we must consider the interests 
of the masses of people in all strata, both in urban and rural 
areas. Our country's reform is compatible with the fundamental 
interests of the broadest masses of people. However, this does 
not mean that in the process of reform, every stratum and 
individual will receive equal interests and tangible benefits 
all at the same time. In light of this, in conducting our work, 
we must show particular concern about the masses of people who 
are not well-off or even have considerable difficulties in their 
daily lives at present. We must adopt effective measures to 
earnestly resolve the difficulties encountered by low-income 
people in their daily lives. Li Peng said: Thanks to the 
efforts of all quarters, the momentum of excessive increases in 
the prices of grain, edible oil, and nonstaple food in the 
preceding period is now under control, and the prices have come 
down to some extent. We must take further steps to ensure that 
the high sales prices will continue to drop. 
  Li Peng pointed out: Developing production and enlivening 
circulation are basic conditions for maintaining an abundant 
supply of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible oil in the 
market and for maintaining the relative stability of their 
prices. Developing production constitutes the foundation for 
ensuring the supply of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and edible 
oil. We must mobilize the initiative of the peasants to carry 
out scientific farming and vigorously develop nonstaple food, 
grain, cotton, and edible oil production. He said: On the 
basis of a vigorously developed production, we must establish a 
big commodity circulation setup and an operating mechanism 
promoting overall balance, free flow of goods, and flexible 
operation. Governments in all localities must attach importance 
to the construction of transportation, storage, preservation, 
and other basic circulation facilities to facilitate the 
shipment of vegetables from the south to the north, and grain 
from the north to the south and from the central regions to the 
west. We must truly ensure the free flow of commodities and 
closely link production regions with marketing regions. 
Governments in all localities must take further steps to remove 
all kinds of obstacles to circulation and sternly crack down on 
gangsters and thugs in the transportation sector. Large and 
medium-sized cities must create conditions to attract 
out-of-town vegetable growers to market their produce in the 
city by ensuring their safety and fair trade. 
  Li Peng said: To do a good job in the production and supply 
of nonstaple food, grain, and edible oil, it is necessary to pay 
attention to market construction and the establishment of a 
network which combines agricultural produce markets, which 
center on wholesale markets, with retailers. This important 
experience was gained by some of the large and medium-sized 
cities which achieved results in building "vegetable basket" 
projects in recent years. 
  He said: Under the conditions of decontrolled operations, 
governments at all levels must pay particular attention to 
market management. Lifting control to enliven operations does 
not mean washing our hands of the operations. We must sternly 
crack down on illegal elements who manipulate the market, 
speculate or jack up prices, produce or sell substandard or fake 
merchandise, entrap people or swindle them, or commit other 
illegal acts. Industrial, commercial, public security, railway, 
and transportation departments must closely coordinate with each 
other to take concerted action and ensure a notable improvement 
in market order before the Spring Festival and maintain a good 
market order indefinitely. 
  Li Peng said: At present, the following three tasks should 
be grasped in the regulation and control of farm products in our 
country: 
  First, it is necessary to establish a reserve system of 
grain, oil, cotton, meat, vegetables, and sugar. Both the 
central and local authorities should strive to improve 
administration over the reserve system. 
  Second, it is necessary to establish a risk fund system for 
grain and sideline products. All subsidies from central and 
local authorities for grain, meat, and vegetables should be used 
for the establishment of the risk fund system. Moreover, more 
capital should be raised from other sources for the purpose of 
expanding the system to an appropriate scale. 
  Third, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system for 
the farm products market and improve the farm products 
information network. In this way, the government will be to 
rely on scientific information provided by them to make 
decisions on the implementation of macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
  Li Peng said: It is been stressed many times that the 
"vegetable basket project" should be undertaken by various 
localities, especially by the governments of large and medium 
cities, through the implementation of a mayoral responsibility 
system. Ensuring the people's livelihood needs is the primary 
function of mayors and is most important for stabilizing the 
overall situation. This should be included as a target for the 
personal responsibility system for mayors, and evaluations 
should be conducted each year. The results of the evaluation 
should be reported to the city people's congress and the city's 
people. 
  He said: How can a mayor successfully carry out the 
"vegetable basket" task? The most important thing for a mayor 
to do is to ensure a balance between supply and demand in 
nonstaple foods. All big and medium cities should be 
responsible for maintaining an overall balance between supply 
and demand. Under no circumstances should they wait until there 
are problems before attempting to achieve a balance between 
supply and demand. If that happens, the loss will be colossal. 
It is necessary to ensure sufficient land for growing 
vegetables and to strictly stop the practice of using vegetable 
land for other purposes. Without vegetable farms, there will be 
no vegetable baskets. Therefore, we must protect the vegetable 
basket with vegetable farms. In some cities vegetable land has 
been used for other purposes to an excessive extent, and 
vegetable land has not been supplemented sufficiently. This is 
one of the important causes that led to a shortage of vegetable 
supplies in the relevant localities. This problem must be 
solved as soon as possible. Vegetable land that has been used 
for other purposes must be quickly supplemented. While 
establishing their own nonstaple food producing bases, various 
large and medium cities should also, in line with the need, 
establish nonstaple food producing and marketing coordination 
zones with other cities. It is necessary to gradually form a 
vegetable production pattern in which production relies mainly 
on suburban areas, supplemented by nearby farming areas, and is 
regulated by products from other cities. 
  Li Peng said: To achieve a balance between supply and 
demand, we must ensure funds for the construction of bases for 
producing vegetables and other nonstaple foods, funds for price 
risks, and funds for the construction of cold storages, the 
circulation setup, and other infrastructure facilities. 
  Li Peng expressed the hope that when participants returned 
home, they will conscientiously publicize and implement the 
guidelines of this conference and adopt measures, in line with 
actual conditions, to make sure their work is done well. He 
also hoped that they will, in accordance with the guidelines of 
this conference, do a good job in ensuring a stable supply of 
grain, oil, and nonstaple foods during the Spring Festival, so 
as to enable the people to have a happy and peaceful festival. 
  Leading comrades of the Central Committee and the State 
Council who also attended the conference were Zou Jiahua, Qian 
Qichen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wen Jiabao, Chi Haotian, Song 
Jian, Chen Junsheng, Ismail Amat, and Luo Gan. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji made a speech on the first day of 
the 
conference. In his speech, he analyzed the current economic 
situation and stressed the importance and urgency of doing the 
work on vegetables, grain, oil, and cotton well, in order to 
guarantee market supply, and maintain social stability and the 
overall situation of reform and opening to the outside world. 
He also mapped out an overall plan for unifying thinking and 
understanding, clearly defining responsibilities, and doing work 
on the"vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and oil still better, 
and set explicit requirements in connection with this work.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The Sino-British row over 
Hong Kong is sure to harm bilateral trade ties, Chinese Minister 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here 
Friday. "The unfriendly and uncooperative move by the British 
side will certainly effect normal trade," Wu said referring to 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's proposals for democratic 
reform in the British territory prior to its reversion to China 
in 1997. 
  Two-way trade between China and Britain actually surged 86 
percent last year to 3.59 billion dollars and Wu said China 
would be unhappy to see the deterioration of a trading 
partnership with such potential. However, she put the blame for 
the ongoing dispute squarely at Britain's door, saying: "It is 
not the responsibility of the Chinese side."

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- China hopes to 
restore its signatory status in the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) six months before the agreement reached in the 
Uruguay Round of world trade talks comes into effect, a 
high-ranking Chinese trade official said here today.6 
  Gu Yongjiang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, explained that in this way, the Chinese National 
People's Congress, China's top legislative body, would have 
enough time to approve the agreement. 
  According to the rules, China should resume its GATT status 
before the package of GATT agreements go into effect, thus 
becoming a member country of the world trade organization. 
  Gu said this while answering a question at a press 
conference 
held by the information office of the State Council. 
  China, which was originally one of the signatories of GATT 
and withdrew from it for various reasons, formally applied in 
1986 to restore its original status. 
  Gu said that after seven years of negotiations, the Chinese 
delegation has clearly explained China's economic and trade 
system to the member countries of GATT, which have got an 
overall knowledge of it. 
  During the period, great reform has been carried out in 
China's economic and trade system. As a result, the system is 
very close to the principles of GATT now, Gu said. 
  Thus, he said, it is high time to discuss concretely the 
text 
of the protocol for the resumption of China's status in GATT. 
  Most of the signing member countries hoped that the 
negotiations would achieve rapid progress, Gu said, adding that 
some countries have begun or declared they will begin 
negotiations with China on tariff problems. 
  One of the difficulties facing the work is that some major 
signing parties' high demands exceed China's economic ability, 
Gu said. 
  Gu expressed his hope that the major signing countries will 
actually support China's effort. 
  On the timetable, Gu said that China of course would like to 
return to GATT at an early date, and that the Uruguay Round of 
trade talks, which wound up on December 15 last year, 
objectively provided a timetable for China's resumption of its 
status in GATT.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, January 29 (XINHUA) -- As China 
deepens its reform and opening, foreign investors will be 
allowed to operate in some areas in the country from which they 
were once barred, a high-ranking Chinese official said here 
today. 
  Speaking at a World Economic Forum's special session on 
China, Qi Huaiyuan, director of Foreign Affairs Office of 
China's State Council, said the areas include power plants, 
railways, airports and expressways. 
  The dynamic Chinese economy was a hot topic at the forum, 
which opened on January 27 and attracted about 1,200 officials, 
entrepreneurs, bankers and economists from all over the world. 
  Qi briefed the participants on the achievements of China's 
reform and opening as well as some of the new steps to be taken 
by the Chinese Government. 
  Qi told them that China's gross national product (GNP) grew 
12.8 percent in 1992 and about 13 percent last year. 
  He said, however, that China is not deliberately striving 
for 
a two-digital growth rate for its own sake. The rate for this 
year is preferably at 9 percent, he added. 
  On China's foreign trade, Qi said that the import and export 
volume rose from 20.64 billion U.S. dollars in 1978 to 195.72 
billion in 1993. 
  Qi said that China's import in 1993 alone was more than 100 
billion U.S. dollars, and a total of more than 700 billion 
dollars of goods will be imported for the rest of this decade. 
  He expressed the hope that as a major trading power in the 
world, China's status as a contracting party to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) "will be restored as soon 
as possible." 
  "China's re-entry will further stimulate the expansion of 
its 
trade and economic cooperation with other countries on the basis 
of equality and mutual benefits and will also strengthen the 
world's multilateral trading regime," Qi said.

the CPC Central Committee International Liaison Department by an 
unidentified RENMIN RIBAO reporter; place and date not given: 
"Make More Friends, Enhance Understanding, Develop Cooperation, 
Increase Influence--the Spokesman of the International Liaison 
Department of the CPC Central Committee Answers Staff Reporter's 
Questions on New Developments in the CPC's Contacts With Foreign 
Political Parties"] 
  [Text] [RENMIN RIBAO] First of all, would you like to 
give us a briefing on the general situation of our party's 
foreign-related contacts? 
  [Spokesman] Yes. Our party's foreign-related contacts have 
always remained a major part of our party's work, as well as an 
important element of China's diplomatic work as a whole. 
General Secretary Jiang stressed in his report to the 14th 
party congress: "The Communist Party of China attaches great 
importance to its ties with political parties in all countries." 
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, our party has made major readjustments to the 
principle of foreign-related work in light of the development of 
the international situation. As a result, our party is focusing 
its foreign-related work on achieving an international 
environment which is favorable to China's modernization drive 
and making greater contributions to peace and development 
throughout the world. The party also advocates making friends 
far and wide and seeks common ground on major issues while 
reserving differences on minor ones when dealing with other 
parties. Moreover, the substance and pattern of cooperation have 
also gone beyond purely political contacts to multi-level 
cooperation which aims at pushing forward economic and 
technological exchanges. In this way, the party's 
foreign-related work can be carried out much more extensively, 
and the party has gradually expanded its contacts and exchanges 
with all kinds of political parties and organizations in the 
world. Our party has formally drawn up and written into its 
Constitution four principles guiding the establishment of 
party-to-party relations with political parties of all kinds: 
independence and self-reliance, total equality, mutual respect, 
and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. 
Alongside China's development, which has attracted attention 
throughout the world, the trend of foreign political parties 
seeking normal ties and expanding exchanges and cooperation with 
our party out of their own considerations is also gathering 
momentum, and our party's contacts with all kinds of political 
parties are becoming more extensive and active. Our party has 
maintained relations, in different forms, with over 200 
political parties in more than 100 countries, among which there 
are not only communist parties but also socialist parties, 
social democratic parties, labor parties, and other parties in 
developed countries, as well as political parties in developing 
countries. On the basis of such extensive exchanges, we attach 
special importance to our ties with major political parties all 
over the world. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What are your comments on the international 
situation in 1993, especially the situation of political parties 
in different countries? 
  [Spokesman] The year 1993 witnessed profound and 
comprehensive changes in the world. China's ties with other 
countries underwent further development, and the international 
situation proved to be more favorable to our country. 
  Amid the profound international changes of the past year, 
changes within political parties were especially prominent and 
have had a certain impact on the political situation of their 
countries. Major parties in some Western countries which had 
been in a ruling position for a long time, lost their ruling 
status in elections and gave way to a number of new and smaller 
parties, and ultra-rightist and local splittist forces gained 
favor in some countries. Different political forces in a number 
of eastern European and central Asian countries continue to go 
through the process of disintegration and reorganization, and an 
intricate and complex situation has been registered in the 
strengths of different political parties. Under this new 
situation, our party made new breakthroughs in its ties with 
political parties in other countries. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What breakthroughs did the CPC make in its 
relations with political parties from its neighboring countries 
in 1993? 
  [Spokesman] The CPC has always attached importance to 
strengthening its relations with political parties in other 
countries, especially those of our neighboring countries. In 
1993, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and several Standing 
Committee members of the CPC Central Committee met on separate 
occasions with a number of delegations of major foreign parties. 
Comrade Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the CPC 
Political Bureau, headed a party and government delegation to 
North Korea to attend celebrations of "the 40th Anniversary of 
the Victory of the Motherland's Liberation War;" and Comrade 
Ding Guangeng, member of the CPC Political Bureau and the 
Secretariat, led a CPC delegation to visit Vietnam and Laos. At 
the beginning of 1994, a CPC delegation headed by Comrade Wen 
Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Political Bureau and member 
of the Secretariat, paid a visit to Singapore on its way to 
India and Bangladesh. All these important overseas visits have 
further augmented the mutual understanding and friendship 
between the CPC and the ruling parties of these countries and 
have served to give a major impetus to the development of 
China's friendly cooperative ties with these neighboring 
countries and their peoples. 
  While maintaining our existing relations with Japan's 
Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Socialist Party, we 
have also had extensive contacts with other political parties 
which participate in Japan's government and political affairs, 
including the New Party, Shinseito, and other political parties 
with which we have not yet established formal relations. We 
have also set up ties with South Korea's Democratic Liberal 
Party. Our party's friendly relations with the ruling party of 
Mongolia have also made further progress. Our exchanges with 
political parties in south and central Asian countries, such as 
India, have also been strengthened. The senior leaders of both 
the ruling and opposition parties of Bangladesh visited China 
separately in 1993. Our party has established ties with all 
ruling parties and major opposition parties in the south Asian 
countries. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] In addition to our neighboring Asian 
countries, can you also brief us on our party's ties with 
political parties in Latin American and African countries? 
  [Spokesman] Political parties in the developing countries 
generally follow China's reform and opening up with close 
interest as well as its practice of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. They have cherished the good will of 
promoting positive ties with the CPC. Major political parties 
and the leading figures of many Latin American countries have 
visited China one after another. Rafael Caldera, the newly 
elected president of Venezuela, had cordial meetings with party 
leaders and began making his election speech during his friendly 
visit to Tibet. During their visit to China, the leaders of 
Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party exchanged extensive 
views and experience on how to rule the party and administer the 
country as well as on issues of common concern. Important 
political parties and public figures from some Latin American 
countries which have not yet established diplomatic relations 
with China, such as Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, also 
paid visits to our country one after another in 1993. The 
Chinese NPC delegation was given a warm reception during its 
visit to Paraguay by friends from the country's political 
parties who had visited China before. Our persistence in 
establishing relations with ruling parties and major opposition 
parties in countries which have not yet established diplomatic 
relations with China has undoubtedly had a positive impact on 
promoting our ties with these countries. 
  It has been a long time since our party began to set up ties 
with parties in African countries. In 1993, we established new 
relations with some more political parties. The CPC has always 
enjoyed friendly relations with political parties and 
organizations which oppose racial segregation and fight for 
racial liberation. Such friendly exchanges have been further 
boosted alongside the progress South Africa has made in the 
peace process. In 1993, the principal leaders of the African 
National Congress of South Africa, the South African Communist 
Party, and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania visited China 
on invitation, while our party also sent delegations to visit 
South Africa on two occasions. Meanwhile, our party also 
carried out friendly exchanges with the ruling parties, parties 
participating in government and political affairs, and major 
opposition parties of other African countries in 1993. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] It has been learned that the CPC has added 
the serving economic construction to its foreign-related work in 
recent years. What progress did the party achieve in this area 
in 1993? 
  [Spokesman] It has indeed been a special feature of our 
party's foreign-related work in recent years to, through the 
channels of exchanges with political parties and mass groups, 
act as go-between for relevant economic departments and 
localities inside the country, to introduce foreign capital, 
technology, and able personnel from abroad, and to provide 
direct services for our country's socialist modernization drive. 
We have already done a great deal and have attained positive 
results in promoting economic, trade, and technological 
cooperation. Our efforts to carry out economic and trade 
activities with economic organizations recommended by foreign 
political parties have been welcomed by political parties in all 
countries. Initial results have also been achieved in 
introducing foreign investment through the political party 
channel. During their overseas visits, the leading comrades 
from the party organizations of the relevant provinces and 
cities have also paid attention to establishing positive 
economic and trade ties or cooperation with relevant countries. 
Upon the invitation of political parties and organizations in a 
number of countries, we have sent several delegations and groups 
to these countries to conduct special-topic studies on issues 
concerning relations between the central authorities and 
localities, relations between the market economy and 
macroeconomic control, as well as the social insurance system. 
This is also one of our attempts to provide direct services for 
the building of the four modernizations. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] How are the party's relations with political 
parties in Western countries? 
  [Spokesman] It is another major feature of the CPC's 
foreign-related work under the new situation not to base our 
party-to-party contacts on ideological differences and common 
grounds. In 1993, our party-to-party exchanges with Germany, 
France, and Britain underwent new progress during the process in 
which we strived to promote and improve our ties with political 
parties of Western countries through various means. Contacts 
with the Socialist Party International and other international 
political organizations, including their member parties, also 
tend to be more active. In joint sponsorship with the 
subordinate research institutions of Nordrhein-Westfalen, 
Germany, we held a symposium on "Europe's unified general market 
and China" and invited more than 10 people from the European 
Communities and Nordrhein-Westfalen to carry out extensive and 
frank discussions with the relevant Chinese counterparts on a 
number of issues, including the opportunities and challenges 
presented to China by the unified general market of the European 
Communities, opposition to trade protectionism, standardization 
of product quality and technology, and intellectual property 
rights. This symposium proved to play a positive role in 
augmenting mutual understanding and establishing mutually 
beneficial economic and trade cooperation ties between the two 
sides. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] New progress was indeed made in the party's 
exchanges with other political parties in 1993. We would like 
to ask you to say a few more words to our readers on a general 
appraisal of the party's contacts with other political parties 
in the past year and on the party's work in the new year. 
  [Spokesman] In 1993, under the guidance of the spirit of the 
14th party congress, our party always took the overall 
diplomatic situation into consideration when carrying out its 
foreign-related work, concentrated its energy and attention on 
key issues, and attained fairly satisfactory results. Based on 
our already established ties with political parties of all 
types, our party set up new relations with another 18 political 
parties in 11 countries in the past year. Facts have clearly 
shown that the CPC is enjoying a greater role in international 
affairs by building bridges for party-to-party contacts, making 
more friends, enhancing understanding, and promoting friendly 
cooperation. 
  The reason why our party's foreign-related work can undergo 
continued development and expansion under the new situation is 
that, first, the world-famous tremendous achievements attained 
by China in its reform, opening up, and economic construction 
have been attached with great importance by political parties of 
all countries in the world and have aroused their interest in 
establishing or expanding ties with our party; second, as 
China's ruling and leading party, the CPC is playing a decisive 
role in political life within the country. Political parties 
from foreign countries all want to initiate contacts and 
cooperate with our party. Our party has always attached great 
importance to its foreign-related work, regarding the work as 
one important component of China's diplomatic work as a whole. 
Contacts among political parties have always been an important 
aspect of international exchanges. This is especially true 
during major changes in the international structure, for 
political parties from many countries will feel a greater need 
to exchange views and experiences with each other on various 
issues and seek possibilities for cooperation through 
party-to-party contacts. 
  It can be predicted that various political powers will 
continue to divide and reorganize during 1994. This colorful 
world can provide the CPC with a vaster area in which to carry 
out its foreign-related work. As always, we will adhere to the 
four principles of independence and self-reliance, total 
equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in one another's 
internal affairs; will strengthen our ties with political 
parties of all types in a more extensive and comprehensive way; 
will carry out sincere cooperation with them; and will make

<H3>  China Plays an Active Role in the Multipolar 
Arena </H3>
  Events from Chinese President Jiang Zemin's formal meeting 
with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle to the successive visits 
to Beijing by 31 heads of state, 18 speakers and 28 foreign 
ministers create a vivid picture regarding China's 
omnidimensional diplomacy in the multipolar international arena. 
<H5>  The Sino-U.S. Summit Meeting Achieves Results </H5>
  A matter of first importance in China's foreign affairs in 
1993 should be the formal summit meeting between Jiang Zemin and 
Clinton held in Seattle on the 19 November. It was not only the 
first formal Sino-U.S. summit meeting since the "Beijing 
disturbance" in 1989, but also a contact in which both sides 
sought a favorable turn at a time when Sino-U.S. relations were 
undergoing twists and turns. So their meeting was of special 
significance. 
  Jiang Zemin's meeting with Clinton occurred at the crucial 
time when there had been conflict between China and the United 
States, though neither side wished to fall out with the other 
completely. Ever since Clinton took office, Sino-U.S. relations 
have tended to be strained. The two most prominent incidents 
created by Washington in July were: The U.S. ban on the export 
of high-tech, sensitive products to the PRC for two years on the 
so-called grounds that "China had transferred M-11 missile 
technology to Pakistan"; and the obstruction by U.S. warships of 
the Chinese freighter "Yinhe" on its way to Iran in accordance 
with false information that the freighter was loaded with the 
precursors of chemical weapons. These were the strong measures 
taken against China by the United States on the issue of weapons 
proliferation. However, Beijing did not submit. It strongly 
protested to Washington, declaring that it would reconsider its 
commitment to the "missile technology control regime" and 
claiming compensation of $12.93 million from the United States 
for the loss which China suffered from the "Yinhe" incident. 
<H3>  The United States Will Shift Its Target for an Economic 
Boost to Asia </H3>
  On the other hand, the United States has decided to shift 
the 
focus of its foreign policy to Asia in accordance with its 
primary target for rejuvenating its economy, which is suffering 
a slump. Under such circumstances Clinton reiterated that 
Sino-U.S. relations will be strengthened while he was on his way 
to Tokyo to attend the G-7 summit meeting and during his visit 
to Seoul. Some White House advisers offered advice, suggesting 
that Washington change its China policy. Then Clinton approved 
his senior officials' visits to Beijing. Charles Freeman, U.S. 
assistant secretary for regional security affairs, visited China 
at the end of October, reopening the dialogue between Chinese 
and U.S. military officials which had been suspended for four 
years. At the same time, Clinton invited Jiang Zemin to attend 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum summit conference in 
Seattle. Thus the Chinese and U.S. Presidents, who had newly 
assumed office, had an opportunity for contact. 
  The meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton lasted 90 
minutes. Later Clinton talked to the press, saying that the 
meeting was "fruitful" and a "good beginning" for Sino-U.S. 
relations, while Jiang Zemin said that the meeting "had promoted 
understanding, helped improve and develop Sino-U.S. relations, 
and marked a good, new beginning for the Sino-U.S. 
relationship." Both leaders made positive comments on their 
meeting. 
  Political observers note China and the United States differ 
on the issues of human rights, trade and weapons proliferation. 
China has not made any concessions. Although Clinton mentioned 
these problems at their meeting, Jiang Zemin ignored them. 
Before setting out for Seattle from Beijing Jiang had 
reiterated China's position, saying that "attaching conditions 
to U.S. most-favored-nation treatment was a practice left over 
from the time of the Cold War and should be discarded." 
  Since the meeting of the Chinese and U.S. leaders, the 
foreign ministers of the two countries have visited each other 
and the departments concerned have increased their mutual 
visits. Qian Qichen said at a press conference that both sides 
had many specific problems to discuss, such as trade, human 
rights and weapons proliferation. Whatever problems concerned 
China and the United States could be discussed. The United 
States is concerned about the big trade deficit, while China is 
concerned about whether it gets approval to purchase U.S. goods. 
  International opinion believes that both China and the 
United 
States have found ways to improve their relationship and China 
has increased its impact on the world. 
<H3>  Kohl Returns Home With Fruitful Results, Having Entered Into 
Business Contracts Worth $2.8 Billion </H3>
  German Chancellor Kohl visited China last November. During 
his visit China and Germany signed more than 20 business 
contracts, agreements and letters of intent, the amount of 
business totaling $2.8 billion. This shows there has been a new 
breakthrough in the relationship between China and a big 
European power. 
  Kohl has been to China three times. However, this was his 
first visit as head of government of unified Germany. It was 
also at a time when Germany had adjusted its "new Asian 
strategy." He made it clear that Germany would follow the policy 
of "one China" and that it would not have any official 
connections with Taiwan or sell it any weapons. 
  Germany, with its powerful economic strength, has noted that 
Asia has maintained a strong impetus in its economic 
development. It is especially attracted by China, whose economy 
has been developing at high speed. At the same time, Germany is 
seeking a permanent seat in the Security Council of the United 
Nations, with the hope that China will vote for it. So Kohl 
visited China in November after visiting five Asian countries, 
namely, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and the ROK, in 
February. He declared that the purpose of his visit to China 
was to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in 
various fields, endowing the German-Chinese relationship with a 
new quality. 
  China badly needs funds and advanced technology from Germany 
in the process of pushing its national economy up to a new 
stage. Germany is China's biggest trading partner in Europe. 
Trade between the two countries this year greatly exceeds the 
total of $6.47 billion in 1992. The contracts signed between 
China and Germany include German loans for the project of 
constructing the Guangzhou underground railway network and 
China's purchase of six German A-340 airbuses. Kohl said that 
there were no obstacles on Germany's part in exchanges between 
Germany and China in the sphere of high technology. There is no 
doubt that Germany has sent China "charcoal in snowy weather," 
given that the United States has banned the export of sensitive 
high-technology products to China. 
  As Taiwan intended to buy submarines from Germany, some 
German enterprises showed great interest and wished to try. 
However, Kohl made it clear that Germany would not sell any 
weapons to Taiwan to avoid possible trouble in the Sino-German 
relationship. 
<H5>  What Lessons Does Britain Draw From What Germany Has Done? </H5>
  In Europe, France is probing to repair its relationship with 
China, while Britain has fallen out with China over the 
political system in Hong Kong. Talks between China and Britain 
have been suspended and China is quickening the preparatory work 
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It is 
inevitable that trade between China and Britain will be 
affected. In this way, Britain has lost a good opportunity to 
enter China's market, in striking contrast with Germany, which 
is quickening its road to the East and promoting all-round 
cooperation with China. 
  During Kohl's visit to China, China sent two signals to the 
West: One was Beijing's perception that Germany took the correct 
stand on the question of Taiwan, thus laying an "important 
foundation for the continuous development of Sino-German 
relations; the other is the great potential of China's market, 
that is, during its Eighth Five-Year Plan from 1991 to 1995, 
China's total import amount will increase from the originally 
planned $300 billion to $400 billion. It is no doubt a great 
attraction to the slack economy of the West. 
<H5>  ASEAN Countries Get Closer to Beijing </H5>
  Heads of state and government leaders of the six ASEAN 
countries visited China, while Qiao Shi, Chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress 
[NPC], visited five ASEAN countries this year. From February 
with its spring chill to November with its clear autumn skies 
and crisp air, Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong, 
President of the Philippines Ramos, and Prime Minister of 
Thailand Chuan Likphai visited China one after another after 
they took office. Sultan Hassanal of Brunei visited Beijing 
after his country established diplomatic relations with China. 
Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir visited China for the 
second time. Although no senior officials from Indonesia 
visited China this year, President Suharto met with Jiang Zemin 
in Seattle. 
<H3>  ASEAN Leaders Take Large Groups of Entrepreneurs To Visit 
China </H3>
  Economic and trade cooperation with mutual benefit is the 
distinctive characteristic of the contacts between China and 
ASEAN countries this year. Some ASEAN leaders took large groups 
of entrepreneurs to visit China directly and signed huge 
cooperative projects with China. Among them is the "Suzhou 
Industrial Park," a cooperative construction project between 
Singapore and China which introduces Singapore's experience in 
the construction and management of Yulang Industrial Park. 
Businessmen from Singapore have also invested in opening up a 
large area in Shandong Province. 
  It is worth noting that the leaders of five ASEAN countries 
do not believe the "China threat theory" spread by the West. 
Instead, they consider that a strong and prosperous China will 
benefit the prosperity and stability of Asia. Moreover, they 
accept China's position on the Nansha Islands, that is, "put 
aside disputes and open them up together." 
  Qiao Shi chose Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and 
the Philippines for his first visit after he became chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the NPC. It never happened in the 
past that a Chinese leader visited five ASEAN countries in one 
trip. During his visit Qiao Shi put forward the four principles 
which China would follow in its contacts with ASEAN countries. 
Of the four principles, the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Coexistence are listed first. This has further promoted the 
trust of the ASEAN countries in China. 
  In November this year, ASEAN Secretary General Singh [xin ge 
6580 2706] paid his first visit to China. His Beijing trip 
resulted in the establishment of the joint Sino-ASEAN Committee 
of Economic and Trade Cooperation and the Joint Sino-ASEAN 
Committee of Science and Technology Cooperation and promoted the 
cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in the fields of 
economy, trade and science and technology. 
<H5>  New Developments in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Indian Relations </H5>
  This year China has also improved relations with Vietnam and 
India. They are neighbors which had once fallen foul of Beijing. 
  In November 1991, leaders of the Communist Party of Vietnam 
Do Muoi and Vo Van Kiet visited China, their trip promoting 
normalization of the relationship between China and Vietnam. At 
the end of 1992, Li Peng paid a return visit to Hanoi, while 
Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh visited Beijing in November this 
year. Their visits deepened top-level mutual understanding. 
The obstacles in Sino-Vietnamese relations lie in the border 
dispute and the Cambodian issue. Now the Cambodian issue has 
been basically settled. Since the normalization of 
Sino-Vietnamese relations, vice foreign ministers and 
specialists of both sides have held meetings to deal with the 
border dispute. In October this year, China and Vietnam signed 
a treaty on the basic principles for solving the issue of border 
territory, laying the foundation for further border negotiations 
between the two countries. 
  Contacts between top officials of China and India have also 
increased. At the end of 1991 Li Peng visited New Delhi, while 
Indian Prime Minister Rao paid a return visit to Beijing in 
November this year. The greatest reward of his visit to China 
was the signing of a treaty ensuring peace and stability in the 
border areas which both sides actually control. Thus, 
conditions for final settlement of the border issue were created. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, visited Nepal, India and Pakistan in 
November. It was another diplomatic move by China to further 
develop good-neighborly relations with these three Southeast 
Asian countries. 
<H5>  China Pays Attention to the Countries to Its North </H5>
  China also lays stress on cooperation with countries of the 
CIS. Exchanges in various fields such as economy, culture and 
military affairs have been further strengthened. 
  Last year Russian President Yeltsin was invited to visit 
China. As a result, trade relations between the two countries 
have been developing rapidly, their trade volume totaling more 
than $5 billion. In June this year, Liu Huaqing, member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the CPC and vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, visited Russia, and Russian Defense Minister Grachev 
visited Beijing in November. Both sides signed a Sino-Russian 
treaty of cooperation between the two defense ministries. It 
involves contacts between personnel and exchanges of experience. 
  In addition, Georgian head of state Shevardnadze, Tajikistan 
head of state Rakhmanov and Lithuanian President Brazanskas 
visited China for the first time. 
  Li Peng originally planned to visit four Central Asian 
countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyszstan, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan, and Mongolia to the north of China as well. He 
postponed his visits to these countries because he suffered a 
sudden heart attack. 
  To seek a peaceful international environment, especially a 
stable surrounding environment, China has promoted friendly 
contacts with its neighboring countries in a big way. Hu 
Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau 
of the CPC, led a party and government delegation to visit the 
DPRK. The visit was also aimed at promoting good relations with 
its neighbor to the northeast. 
<H3>  Countries That Have Established Diplomatic Relations With 
China Have Increased to 158 </H3>
  China has been very active in its foreign affairs this year, 
having established diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic, 
Slovenia, Eritrea and Macedonia and resumed diplomatic relations 
with Liberia. Thus those countries that have established 
diplomatic relations with China total 158. Dominican President 
Seignoret recently visited Beijing, though his country has not 
yet established diplomatic relations with China. 
<H5>  Democratic Parties Get Involved in Foreign Affairs </H5>
  It is a new tendency in China's foreign affairs that leaders 
of China's various democratic parties take turns to welcome 
foreign leaders who come to visit China at the Great Hall of the 
People in Beijing. 
  Rong Yiren, known for his nickname "red capitalist," talked 
freely about internal and external affairs while meeting foreign 
guests in Beijing. Furthermore, he visited Portugal and Spain 
as part of the effort to promote China's foreign affairs. 
<H5>  China's Year of Foreign Ministers </H5>
  It is a new tendency that the foreign ministers that visited 
China this year are particularly numerous. By the end of 
November, there had already been 24. Some people consider this 
year "China's year of foreign ministers." Qian Qichen, Chinese 
vice premier and foreign minister, has been especially busy 
since so many ministers of foreign affairs have visited Beijing. 
At the same time Qian Qichen has also visited 26 countries this 
year (20 countries last year). 
<H3>  Qian Qichen's Frequent and Busy Activities Epitomize China's 
Active Foreign Affairs </H3>
  While attending the 48th UN General Assembly in New York at 
the end of September, Qian met with state heads, government 
leaders and ministers of foreign affairs of nearly 60 countries. 
It is Qian Qichen's frequent and busy activities in foreign 
affairs that epitomize China's foreign affairs. 

<H5>    Deng Xiaoping's 16-Character Policy </H5>
  The pragmatic and flexible display of China's 
omnidimensional 
foreign affairs embodies Deng Xiaoping's analysis of the 
international situation and his diplomatic tactics. In November 
this year, the Chinese authorities first made known a series of 
speeches on China's foreign affairs and the international 
situation made by Deng in recent years. 
  On 3 March 1990 Deng talked with several bigwigs of the CPC 
after great changes had taken place in Eastern Europe. He 
pointed out: "The old pattern is undergoing changes, but this 
process is actually not completed and the new pattern has not 
formed yet. As for the two big issues of peace and development, 
the issue of peace is not settled and the issue of development 
has worsened." 
  In the face of the changeable international situation, Deng 
Xiaoping put forward the 16-character guiding policy for China 
to cope with international problems in its foreign affairs. It 
reads: "Observe coolly, stand firm, tackle calmly and accomplish 
something." 
  On 4 September 1989, when Deng talked with several top 
leaders of the CPC about the present international situation and 
China's tactics, he summarized it in three sentences: "The 
first sentence is to observe coolly; the second one is to stand 
firm; and the third one is to tackle calmly." He said 
emphatically: "Be cool, cool and cool again, immerse ourselves 
in hard work, do a good job, a job of our own." 
  In accordance with the three sentences put forward by Deng 
Xiaoping, in its foreign affairs China went through the test 
when international incidents such as the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union occurred and withstood the pressure caused by 
Western sanctions. On 14 December 1990, 14 months later, Deng 
talked with several bigwigs of the CPC. He urged China to 
accomplish something in diplomacy. He pointed out: "There are 
many unpredictable factors in the international situation, while 
contradictions become more and more prominent." He said: "Some 
Third World countries want China to take the lead. It is a 
fundamental policy of our country that we will never take the 
lead. We cannot afford to do that. It is beyond our strength. 
It is absolutely disadvantageous to do so for we will lose a 
lot of initiative. China will always stand on the side of the 
Third World. China will never seek hegemony, nor will China 
take the lead. However, it is not possible to do nothing on 
international issues. We should accomplish something. What to 
do? I think we will actively promote the establishment of a new 
international order in politics and economy. We are afraid of 
no one and we will not offend anyone. We will act in accordance 
with the five principles of peaceful coexistence, which we will 
stick to on matters of principle and stand." 
  Deng Xiaoping's theory is still guiding Chinese diplomats 
from behind, moving freely and developing flexibly in the 
international arena.
